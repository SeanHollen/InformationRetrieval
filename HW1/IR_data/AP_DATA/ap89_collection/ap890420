<HEAD>Blount County Clerk Indicted On Embezzlement Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A county clerk honored last year as
Tennessee's Clerk of the Year was arrested following his indictment
on charges he embezzled nearly $34,000 in public funds.
   Blount County Clerk Milburn Waters, 61, and Chief Deputy Clerk
Margaret Blair, 40, were arrested following their indictment by a
county grand jury Monday. They were released from the county jail
after posting bonds of $3,000 each.
   Waters has been clerk for 18 years in this eastern Tennessee
city near the Smoky Mountains, and often opens the day at his
office with a prayer and a Bible reading for employees. He is in
charge of collecting money and handling paperwork on business
taxes, marriage licenses and other matters.
   Eight counts in the indictment allege he stole $33,689 from the
county, and three counts accuse him of failing to deposit money
within the three days allowed by law. The charges cover September
1985 through June 1988.
   Blair, Waters' secretary until her promotion three weeks ago,
was indicted on one charge of embezzlement.
   If convicted, Waters faces up to 10 years in jail and Blair up
to five.
   News reports that Waters often took county money for his own
use, leaving IOUs, triggered an investigation by the state Bureau
of Investigation investigated. Waters denied any wrongdoing.
   Last year, Waters received the Clerk of the Year award from the
County Officials Association of Tennessee.
   Waters' award won't be rescinded, said Mahalia Hughes, Sumner
County Circuit Court clerk and secretary-treasurer for the
association.
   ``Once you get them you've got them,'' she said of the annual
awards. ``Waters has been an outstanding clerk as far as I know.''

<HEAD>Students Protest on National Black Student Action Day</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 11th, ``Racism is ..., to UPDATE with

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Students chained themselves inside a college administration
building in Ohio and marched by the hundreds across other U.S.
campuses Thursday as part of a nationwide call for improvements for
black students.
   The protests, loosely organized as National Black Student Action
Day, were intended to publicize demands for black studies
requirements, more black faculty members and other remedies to what
students say are persistent patterns of discrimination.
   In Ohio, about 150 College of Wooster students _ most of them
white _ occupied the campus administration building, Galpin Hall,
for 13{ hours and chained themselves inside, refusing to admit
administrators.
   The students left the building peacefully about 8:30 p.m.,
saying the school had met their demands to recruit and hire a black
psychologist and counselor, increase office space for the director
of black student affairs and grant amnesty for the protesters.
   School officials, however, did not meet their requests for more
black faculty and an administrative push for a black studies
requirement, among other changes, said a college spokesman, Jeff
Hanna.
   ``It is necessary to recognize the fact that Wooster is making
needed strides toward diversity and a spirit of community,'' the
students said in a statement read by a spokesman, Mark Goodman, a
junior from Ann Arbor, Mich.
   Earlier, the protesters said they had been making no progress in
talks with college President Henry Copeland, and decided to occupy
the building as ``the culmination of dissatisfaction with progress
on our concerns by both blacks and whites.''
   At Duke University at Durham, N.C., 65 students marched across
campus but did not carry signs or banners.
   ``Our presence speaks for itself,'' said Chris Foster, vice
chairman of the National Association of Black Students for
Educational Advancements, the group that sponsored the nationwide
protests.
   The marchers stopped in front of the undergraduate financial aid
office and chanted ``Too black, too strong!'' three times before
continuing the march across campus.
   ``Racism is deeply rooted in society and needs to be understood
and change, Provost Phillip Griffiths said after receiving a list
of the students' demands. ``We are committed to this process.''
   In Texas, about 35 white students and two professors at Trinity
University students joined 10 black students in a march Thursday to
protest of the San Antonio school's minority recruitment record.
   The protesters said there are 19 black students among the 2,500
Trinity undergraduates. The school says its figures show 24 black
undergraduates.
   Officials at Penn State University locked about 30 black
students out of the administration building as they sought to get
the school's response to demands made earlier this week.
   ``For a university which is always saying the communication
channels are always open ... this is a direct contradiction,'' said
Cindy Williams, a student leader.
   Bill Mahon, a university spokesman, told students crowded
outside a door to the Old Main building several representatives of
the group could go in the building to meet with administrators.
   About 150 demonstrators at Harvard University marched silently
in double-file across campus for a rally. The students then
delivered their specific demands to the administration, including a
better racial climate on campus, more black faculty and more
courses dealing with black issues.
   ``We are invisible to the Harvard administration because they
have chosen to ignore our needs and concerns for hundreds of
years,'' said Robert Henry, president of the Harvard-Radcliffe
Black Students Association.
   In Detroit, student demonstrators in their ninth day of
occupying a Wayne State University building were operating under a
news blackout as negotiations with the administration continued.
   Earlier in the week, the university gave in to some of the
students' demands, including making the Center for Black Studies a
university department with its own professors and degree program.
   In New York, about 150 students presented a list of demands to
the Committee on Ethnicity at Barnard College, then marched across
the street to the college's parent, Columbia University, to present
the same demands to the administration there, according to Barnard
spokeswoman Cathy Cowhey.
   The students want the university to divest itself of holdings in
South Africa ``as they promised four years ago'' and to ``stop
their dehumanizing gentrification of black and Latin communities.''
   ``We've done that already,'' Columbia spokeswoman Judith Leynse
said of the divestment demands. She refused to comment about the
demand concerning gentrification.

   A judge on Wednesday added at least 25
years to the prison term of an inmate whose incarceration began
with reform school at age 9 and who admitted murdering two men at
age 15 ``for the experience.''
   Willie Bosket, 26, was sentenced for the April 1988 stabbing of
a prison guard. He is already serving 28 years to life for assault,
arson and being a persistent felon.
   Ulster County Court Judge Francis Vogt sentenced Bosket to 25
years to life for first-degree attempted murder, 7{ to 15 years for
attempted assault, 3{ to 7 years for weapons possession, and 3{ to
7 years for promoting prison contraband. Those sentences will run
concurrently.
   ``I think you thrive on attention,'' Vogt said. ``Why else would
you plunge an 11-inch knife into the chest of a young man who did
you no harm, who you didn't even know?''
   ``You should never be turned loose on society,'' Vogt said,
adding that Bosket would remain a threat even while imprisoned.
   ``I'm sending an innocent person to death, because I'm sure
you'll kill someone (in prison).''
   Bosket has proved to be a security problem while in prison and
recently was charged with assaulting a guard. On his way into court
Wednesday, Bosket tried to kick a corrections officer who was
removing a leg manacle that bolted Bosket to the van.
   In court, Bosket began a rambling statement before the judge cut
him off.
   ``This sentence means nothing. I spit on this court,'' Bosket
said.
   ``I laugh at this court ... and the entire ... system. I'll
haunt this system. I am what this system created,'' he said.
   Vogt ordered that Bosket be removed from the courtroom
immediately after the sentencing when Bosket began to quote Russian
novelist Feodor Dostoevski.
   As he was being led out of the courthouse a reporter asked
Bosket if he would kill again. Bosket replied: ``Next time I will
not try, I'll succeed.''
   At his trial in February, Bosket said his only regret was that
he didn't succeed in killing guard Earl Porter with a handmade
knife.
   Bosket is held in solitary confinement in a specially
constructed cell.
   Bosket first gained notoriety in 1978 when he murdered two men
during robberies in New York City. The case was a catalyst for
change in New York state law regarding juveniles who commit murder.

   Here are some specifications on the USS Iowa:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Builders: New York Navy Yard.
   Laid down: June 27, 1940.
   Launched: Aug 27, 1942.
   Commissioned: Feb. 22, 1943.
   Displacement: 45,000 tons (standard), 58,000 tons full load.
   Dimensions (in feet): 887.2 x 108.2 x 38.
   Speed: 35 knots.
   Range: 5,000 miles at 30 knots; 15,000 miles at 17 knots.
   Complement: 1537.
   Homeport: Norfolk, Va.
   Gunnery: The Iowa has nine 16-inch guns mounted on three
turrets. Each gun can fire projectiles weighing up to 2,700 pounds
at a maximum range of 23 miles. It also has 12 5-inch guns.
   Missiles: Each of the eight Tomahawk missile launchers has a
revolver-like chamber inside with four missiles to each launcher.
The missiles have a range of 250-300 miles. The Harpoon missile
(50-60 mile range) launchers are arranged one missile to a
canister. When the missile is fired the whole canister is replaced.
No missile reloads are carried within the ship.
   Modernization: The 1982 refitting of the Iowa included the
installation of electronics warfare system (ESM), air search radar,
and complete modernization of all electronic and communications
equipment. Older gun mounts were removed and replaced with Tomahawk
and Harpoon cruise missile launchers. Also added were four Phalanx
20 mm close-in weapons system mounts. The fantail was reshaped to
allow the open storage of three helicopters while leaving the pad
vacant for the operation of a fourth.
   General: Iowa class battleships are the most heavily armored
U.S. warships ever constructed, designed to survive ship-to-ship
combat with enemy ships armed with 18 inch guns.
   The Iowa was built during World War II, saw action in the
Pacific, was mothballed until the Korean War, and mothballed again.
It was modernized and reactivated in 1984, and returned home last
year after service escorting Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf.

<DATELINE>ON THE SEA OF GALILEE, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Israeli team with
remote-controlled yellow submarines the size of sea turtles is
searching the bottom of the Sea of Galilee for underwater salt
wells.
   But they also have taken the time to look for remnants of a
battle between Jews and Romans in 67 A.D. when 6,700 Jews were
believed to have been killed.
   The submarines were brought to Israel by U.S. marine scientists.
   ``It's the first time we can see for ourselves what the bottom
of the lake looks like,'' said Tom Berman, director of the Kinneret
Laboratory for Limnology on Galilee's northern shore. Kinneret is
the Hebrew name for the Sea of Galilee.
   Project director Richard Cooper, a marine scientist from the
University of Connecticut, said submarines are superior to divers
because they go as deep as 1,000 feet and, more importanly in this
case, can stay under water for as long as 10 hours.
   One recent day aboard the project's control boat, anchored a
little over a mile offshore, Cooper lowered one submarine, equipped
with a TV camera, still camera and strobe light, into the lake to
look for salt water craters.
   Geologists, biologists and marine scientists gathered around a
small monitor on deck to analyze the TV camera's pictures from the
rocky bed of the lake which about 140 feet at its deepest point.
   The 64-square-mile Sea of Galilee is about 700 feet below sea
level and is Israel's major source of fresh water, providing nearly
one-third of the nation's supply.
   Salt levels are now at an acceptable level but might increase if
water levels drop because of scant rainfall, Berman said.
   Data collected by the submarines could help scientists lower the
lake's salt levels by determining what activates the salt wells.
   ``Nobody understands the mechanisms whereby these salt sources
begin to flow,'' Berman said.
   Scientists also got a closer look at a three-foot-high ridge on
the lake's bottom, indicating recent earthquake activity. The Sea
of Galilee is part of an active rift valley extending from the
Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea to the Red Sea in the south.
   The 15-member crew of the control boat spent one day during the
two-week project looking for what they might find from the lake
battle in 67 A.D., said Shelley Wachsmann, inspector for underwater
antiquities in the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums.
   The battle took place during the Roman conquest of Galilee. When
the Romans overran the town of Migdal on the western shore of the
lake, Jews fled in boats. The Romans pursued them in hastily
constructed rafts and killed about 6,700 in the battle.
   ``One could see the whole lake stained with blood and crammed
with corpses, for not one man escaped,'' wrote the Jewish historian
and soldier Flavius Josephus who took part in the battle.
   Wachsmann said the submarines probed several areas in the
northern part of the lake where initial research indicated boats
from the battle might have sunk.
   The submarines came up with nothing, but Wachsmann said they
would be useful tools in future research.
   The submarine project is part of a U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration long-term study comparing large lakes
around the world, including Lake Victoria and Lake Malawi in Africa
and the Great Lakes in the United States.
   The submarines are going back to the United States when the
project ends, but the scientists will return next year for further
studies, Berman said.

   The Norwegian National Opera wants to reach
a wider audience, so it's staging ``The Barber of Seville'' as a
drive-in movie, where motorists can toot for the tenor and feast on
burgers and fries 'til the fat lady sings.
   ``We were inspired by American drive-in movies,'' said opera
spokesman Terje Baskerud. ``It started as a wild idea, but we're
going to try it.''
   The state opera hopes to convert downtown Oslo's Youngstorget
open market into a drive-in for 200-300 cars with a live broadcast
on a giant TV screen of its Sept. 23 premiere of ``The Barber of
Seville,'' Baskerud said in an interview.
   ``We are arranging with local restaurants to serve food on trays
that hang from car windows, hopefully by waitresses on roller
skates,'' he said.
   There won't be tinny in-car speakers typical of U.S. drive-in
movies, ``but the music will be so loud that I don't think anyone
in the area will have trouble hearing the performance,'' he said.
They also hope to set up a 24-square-yard screen.
   Police, merchants and officials are intrigued by the notion of
marrying 19th century opera to 1950s Americana, but Olso residents
are skeptical, he said.
   ``Unfortunately, we first announced it on April 1 on local
radio. Everyone thought it was an April Fool's joke,'' he said.
Norwegians are wary of April 1 news because of the media's penchant
for tricking them.
   The state opera hopes the drive-in will be free, although its
budget will not cover the costly performance without sponsors.
   ``We haven't worked out all the details yet,'' said Petter
Martin Tanberg of the Drammen advertising agency Andersen and
Holter, which was hired by the opera to handle sponsors and
technical details.
   ``It's hard to say how much it will cost,'' he said, and reponse
from sponsors has yet to be measured. ``Of course, opera is a
favorable thing for businesses to be associated with.''
   People think opera is a grim forum for tales of murder and
betrayal, Baskerud said. ``We want them to see that `The Barber of
Seville' is not a serious piece. It's lively and funny,'' he said.
   The opera's 200 regular performances a year, held in a cramped
former movie theater, already average 90 percent bookings. But
manager Bjoern Simensen, who is known for his unconventional
approach to opera, sees the one-night drive-in scheme as an
investment in the future.
   ``It's great for us to be seen and heard outside our traditional
arena. It would be deadly for us to isolate ourselves in our
private fine arts ghetto,'' he said.
   The Italian-language performance of Rossini's `Barber of
Seville,' first sung in 1816, will be directed by Michail Hampe, a
Cologne Opera specialist in the works of Rossini, and conducted by
Italian Carlo Felice Cillareo, Simensen said.
   Iziar Martinez Galdos will sing the female lead Rosina and the
Scottish Opera's Neill Archer will sing Almaviva, with support from
the Norwegian opera's 26 singers, 42-member chorus and 75-piece
orchestra, Baskerud said.

<TEXT>
   Riot police and soldiers seeking leftist
guerrillas raided trouble-plagued San Marcos University in Lima and
arrested 380 people, school officials said.
   Police said several people were arrested during the
anti-insurgency operation at the university Wednesday, but declined
to give an exact number. They reported seizing weapons and
documents.
   In other incidents:
   _The mayor of San Pedro de Lloc, 400 miles north of Lima, was
shot to death Wednesday by suspected rebels, the government said.
   _In Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima, police said suspected
Maoist insurgents on Tuesday night shot and killed a teacher in his
home and a vegetable seller and her 15-year-old daughter in an open
air market.
   Ayacucho police said it was unclear why the teacher was killed
but that the other two were probably slain for selling food to
government forces.
   Officials have charged that San Marcos, Peru's oldest and
largest university, has been a recruiting ground for leftist
guerrillas and a center for planning terrorist attacks since the
mid-1980s.
   The sweep comes amid strident criticism of the center-left
Aprista government for failing to halt the spreading insurgency of
the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group.
   Government forces moved onto the campus as morning classes
began, breaking down doors of faculty offices and dormitories and
conducting searches, said Jose Saldana, head of San Marcos'
teachers' association.
   He said 380 students, professors and school workers were
arrested, 10 people were injured and officials seized records and
documents.
   Masked student protesters later tried to set up road blocks of
burning debris around the school, five miles west of downtown, but
police drove them back, according to reporters on the scene.
   Shining Path has fought for nine years to topple the elected
government and install a Marxist state. The government says more
than 14,000 people have died in insurgency violence.

   Switzerland says it will allow the

after expelling the agency's correspondent for purportedly

   A Foreign Ministry statement Wednesday said the reopening was
tied to a pledge Novosti will carry out ``the normal activity of a

   It said the decision was part of efforts to improve the
East-West climate in Europe. No date was announced for the
reopening.
   The government accused Novosti in April 1983 of interfering in
Swiss affairs and running a ``center of disinformation, subversion

   Novosti's other Swiss bureau, in Geneva, remained open.

<HEAD>Administration Wants Nearly $2.5 Billion in CFC Profits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration plans to siphon off
$2.45 billion from profits of companies making ozone-depleting
chemicals over the next three years, a proposal that has infuriated
the industry and may spark a fight in Congress.
   The administration wants the money but doesn't want to call its
plan a tax.
   But that's just what it sounds like to the largest manufacturer
of chlorofluorocarbons, Du Pont.
   ``They'll be sued. We will challenge it for sure,'' said a
company official, Tony Vogelsberg.
   The target for the revenue raising is windfall profits that
chemical firms could earn after an international treaty reduces
supplies of chlorofluorocarbons, which destroy the ozone layer and
increase risk of skin cancer.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the influential House
Energy and Commerce Committee, says the administration has ``no
specific authority to levy a tax on ... these commodities,'' and
cautioned against bypassing his committee or ignoring Congress'
taxing authority.
   Dingell, however, indicated he hasn't formed a final opinion.
``I don't have any dogs in the fight at this particular time,'' he
said.
   To complicate matters, the Environmental Protection Agency and
the Office of Management and Budget are at odds over how to collect
the money. OMB wants to auction off rights to produce a specific
amount of CFCs. EPA favors a more straightforward fee on company
profits.
   OMB has budgeted $400 million in revenues in fiscal 1990, $1.5
billion in 1991 and $550 million in 1992. The first-year revenue
figures survived an overall budget agreement between congressional
negotiators and the administration.
   Both agencies agree, however _ and the industry hotly denies _
that there will be windfall profits for manufacturers later this
year, after the U.S. begins implementing a 1987 international
agreement to cut production of the so-called CFCs.
   The government's theory is that demand will far outstrip supply
some months after July, when production must be frozen at 1986
levels. The Montreal Protocol requires that by 1998, production can
be only 50 percent of 1986 figures.
   The five manufacturers of CFCs are developing substitutes, but
they are three to five years away from production. EPA spokesman
Chris Rice said the companies may not hurry to produce them if
they're making windfall profits on current CFCs.
   ``The companies will be making 20 percent less (starting this
year), and the price could go up 500 to 600 percent,'' Rice said.
``They can bring in an incredible amount of money. We're afraid ...
they will have the incentive, because of the profit, to stall, to
delay ... introduction of the substitutes.''
   Vogelsberg, Du Pont's environmental manager for the freon
production division, said, ``We don't see windfall profits as
really being there.
   ``If I say I have a monopoly position and I'm going to raise the
price, you're going to remember what I did to you. I want to
maintain a long-term business relationship. We will not charge more
than our cost justifies.''
   But Vogelsberg, whose company makes half the U.S. supply of
CFCs, said producers will need more money to pay $2 billion to $3
billion for new plants to make substitutes. Companies have large
research and development costs, he added.
   CFCs, manufactured by five companies, are used in refrigerators,
large air conditioning units and car air conditioners, high energy
foam insulation for modern construction, solvents for cleaning
computer components, and cushions in seats and sofas.
   Three companies also make ozone-depleting chemicals called
halons (including one firm that makes both chemicals), which are
used in fire-fighting equipment. Halon production will be frozen in
1992 at 1986 levels.
   Bob Thoma, vice president of government relations for BASF, a
foam insulation maker, said a tax on manufacturers would find its
way to consumers with disastrous consequences.
   ``If you put a $2 per pound tax on roofing applications, it
would add $15,000 for the cost of a roof,'' he said. ``You could
use other materials that are less expensive, but do not have the
same insulation benefits.
   ``The consequences (of switching products) are higher energy
consumption, including burning of coal and oil _ which causes
greater degradation in the greenhouse effect (global warming) and
acid rain.''
   Smaller manufacturers of the insulation would go out of business
and jobs would be lost, Thoma said.
   ``We will get that $400 million somehow, one way or another,''
vowed OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay, referring to the first-year
projected revenues. ``You have to base the argument for windfall
profits on no cheap substitutes being available as supply decreases
and demand remains constant.''
   Emissions from CFCs and halons are non-toxic when released into
the atmosphere, but 10 to 100 years later, when they rise 15-20
miles to the stratosphere, their chemical bonds break apart.
   Scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone, allowing more
of the sun's ultraviolet rays to reach Earth, causing more skin
cancer and eye cataracts, and suppressing human immune systems.

   Six of the seven people slain in a
bloody rampage were laid to rest Wednesday on a quiet, green
hillside in California's wine country and residents learned the
prime suspect had been arrested in Mexico.
   ``This is a day of relief for Sonoma County,'' Sheriff Dick
Michaelsen said after Ramon Salcido Bojorquez' arrest early
Wednesday in Sinaloa state about 850 miles north of Mexico City.
   U.S. authorities hope to extradite Salcido, 28, who had been
sought in an international manhunt since last Friday's killing
spree.
   Salcido is accused of killing his wife, two daughters,
mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law and a winery co-worker.
   Five Sonoma County detectives flew Wednesday afternoon to Mexico
in a Lear jet owned by ``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles M. Schulz,
who lives in the county, and piloted by his son, Craig, Michaelsen
said.
   Salcido is accused of killing his wife, two daughters,
mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law and a winery co-worker.
   He told Mexican police that he killed his wife, Angela, and
co-worker Tracy Toovey because he suspected they were having an
affair, Deputy Attorney General Javier Coello Tracy said in Mexico.
   Salcido's arrest was reported Wednesday morning as about 100
people attended private funeral services for Mrs. Salcido, her
daughters Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1; her mother, Marian Louise
Richards, 47; and her two young daughters, Ruth, 12, and Marie, 8.
   The Rev. Kenneth Cabral of Oakland, a retired Roman Catholic
priest who is a longtime friend of the Richards, officiated at
services preceding burial in a large gravesite at Calvary Catholic
Cemetery.
   Cabral told mourners guarded by 20 sheriff's deputies, ``Death
isn't the end. ... After you die, there are all kinds of beautiful
things awaiting,'' said Judith Kelly, who was among the mourners.
   One by one, white caskets containing the children's bodies and
gray caskets with those of the adults were taken from a cemetery
mausoleum to the burial site and lowered into the ground along with
metal crucifixes and flowers.
   Immediately after the service ended, Angela Salcido's father,
Bob Richards, was told of Salcido's arrest, Undersheriff Gene Fahy
said.
   Richards then went to Petaluma Valley Hospital to visit Carmina
Salcido, 2. Carmina and her sisters' throats were cut, and they
were abandoned at a dump.
   Kelly said the three Richards sons who attended the funeral
agreed they want Carmina to live with a family member when she
recovers.
   The investigators on Shultz' plane were going to Mexico to
discuss extradition and other aspects of the case with Mexican
authorities.
   Although Salcido became a permanent U.S. resident in 1986 after
marrying his wife, he remains a Mexican citizen, said David
Ilchert, district director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service in San Francisco.
   That could help him avoid trial in the United States and a
possible death sentence if convicted.
   Mexico's penal code provides that Mexican citizens can be tried
there for crimes committed elsewhere, but that country does not
have a death penalty.
   FBI agent Mike Dooher said he was confident Salcido would be
returned to the United States regardless of his status.
   But Sonoma County District Attorney Gene Tunney said he had
tried unsuccessfully on two previous occasions to extradite Mexican
citizens on county murder charges.
   ``Of course, we'd rather prosecute him (Salcido) here,'' said
Tunney. ``If there was ever a death penalty case, this is it.
   ``But I would rather have him prosecuted in Mexico under their
law instead of having him go free.''

<HEAD>Man Drops Fight To Have Capone's House Listed On National Register</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An amateur historian says he is yielding to
pressure from Italian-American groups and dropping efforts to have
gangster Al Capone's old house listed on the National Register of
Historic Places.
   ``I still think the house has tremendous historical interest,
but I have no intention of offending anyone, and some people left
me no doubt that they quite clearly are offended by it,'' Mark
Levell said Wednesday.
   Levell, a computer repairman, took up the cause of having the
privately owned house placed on the register in January, after
requests from others were rejected by the Chicago Landmarks
Commission and the Illinois Historic Sites Council.
   His appeal of those rejections went all the way to the National
Register.
   On the way, however, Levell's appeal drew the wrath of the Joint
Civic Committee of Italian-Americans and the Chicago Sun-Times, as
well as the Park Manor Neighborhood Council, which represents
residents of the South Side neighborhood where the house is located.
   The neighborhood council complained that placing the modest
two-story brick house on the register might draw additional
unwanted tourism to Park Manor, which is already visited on a
regular basis by gangster-theme bus tours.
   The newspaper complained that emphasizing 1920s gangster lore
does little for the city's image, and the Italian-American group
objected to continuation of the Italian gangster stereotype.
   ``They complained that I was trying to honor a notorious
criminal, but I never said anything about `honor,''' Levell said.
``The Prohibition gangsters were part of this city's history _
that's all. They were colorful men, but I never suggested them as
role models for anyone.''
   Levell's decision to withdraw the appeal was hailed by Robert
Allegrini, executive director of the Italian-American committee,
who said he was glad Levell had come to understand the sensitivity
of law-abiding Italian-Americans to depiction of their ethnic group
as mobsters.
   ``I'm half Italian myself,'' said Levell. ``The Italian half of
me says one thing, but the historian half of me says, `This is
history.'''
   Levell said Capone lived in the house from 1920 to 1928, but
later moved into the Lexington Hotel for security reasons. He said
Capone's mother and several of his brothers remained in the house
after ``Scarface'' moved out.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bush S&amp;L Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators threatened with a disrupted vacation
overwhelmingly adopted President Bush's savings and loan rescue
after bowing to a last-minute plea to strengthen a key reform.
   Dwarfing all other government bailouts, the plan approved
Wednesday would provide at least $157 billion over the next decade
_ most of it from taxpayers _ to close or merge 350 failed thrift
institutions and make good on government pledges in the rescue of
200 others last year.
   It would also reorganize the regulatory bureaucracy, provide $50
million a year for the Justice Department to pursue fraud in S&amp;Ls
and enact other reforms, chief among them a requirement that thrift
owners back their lending with more of their own capital.
   The ultimate passage of the bill was never in doubt, but Sen.
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, was threatening to prolong debate,
which began Monday, into the weekend unless senators agreed to
tougher capital requirements.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, and Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the panel's senior
Republican, had been resisting amendments, arguing that the package
put together privately by the committee and endorsed by a 21-0 vote
last week was too delicately balanced to withstand many changes
without crumbling.
   But only five minutes before the scheduled start of an 11-day
recess, Metzenbaum succeeded in wresting concessions that allowed
senators to adopt the bill, 91-8, and leave town until May 1.
   The committee's bill had doubled capital standards, requiring
S&amp;L owners to come up with $6 for every $100 in lending, compared
with the current requirement of $3.
   However, it provided a big loophole for about a third of the
nation's 3,000 S&amp;Ls by allowing an accounting item known as ``good
will'' to be counted as capital for the next 25 years. Good will
represents the value of an institution's customer loyalty and other
intangible assets.
   Declaring that ``goodwill isn't worth doodly-doo,'' Metzenbaum
insisted that S&amp;Ls have at least 1.5 percent in ``tangible capital'
_ cash, stocks and property that could easily be converted to cash
and could be seized, in the event of a failure, before turning to
government deposit insurance funds.
   Metzenbaum had sought 3 percent tangible capital, but in the end
had to accept 1.5 percent. Regulators will have the authority to
restrict the growth of institutions falling below that level.
   ``I can't say I'm satisfied with the result that has been
obtained. ... I can say substantive progress has been made,''
Metzenbaum said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady praised the bill, saying,
``We ... applaud the Senate's efforts to maintain strong capital
requirements.''
   Metzenbaum was urged on by two groups _ Consumer Federation of
America and Consumers Union _ that decided to emphasize capital as
an important consumer issue.
   ``I never thought he'd get that. ... Everybody is shocked,''
said Peggy Miller, a lobbyist for the Consumer Federation. The
groups are hoping the Metzenbaum victory will lend momentum to
their fight to toughen the House version of the S&amp;L bill.
   The House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions passed
a similar 1.5 percent standard last week and Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the full committee, says he will try
to increase that when his panel begins redrafting the legislation
next Wednesday.
   He wants the full House to vote by the end of May, sending a
bill to the president's desk in June following a House-Senate
conference.
   Another Metzenbaum amendment will require federal regulators to
review last year's S&amp;L bailouts, possibly renegotiating the deals
to reduce the government's costs.
   The Senate also adopted, by voice vote, an amendment from Sen.
Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, which would require ailing banks and
S&amp;Ls to obtain advance permission from regulators before raising
high-cost deposits through money brokers.
   On a 61-38 vote, senators rejected an effort by Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., to force the top S&amp;L regulator, Federal Home Loan Bank
Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, to undergo reconfirmation by the
Senate.
   The bill as passed guarantees Wall's job through June 1991.
Graham said he faults Wall for underplaying the S&amp;L crisis in the
months before last year's presidential election.
   Riegle lost a fight on how to fund the bailout. The bill creates
a new, quasi-public agency, allowing the government to borrow $50
billion without counting it toward the budget deficit.
   Riegle said taxpayers would have saved $4.5 billion in lower
interest rates over 30 years if the $50 billion was borrowed
through the Treasury. However, his plan would have ballooned the
1989 budget deficit to within range of the all-time high of $221
billion set in 1986.
   On passage of the bill by the Senate, all the no votes were cast
by Democrats: Sens. Max Baucus of Montana, Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, James Exon of Nebraska, Ernest
F. Hollings of South Carolina, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Metzenbaum,
and David Pryor of Arkansas. Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., did not
vote.

<HEAD>Senate Budget Panel Blesses $1.16 Trillion Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is beginning work on the 1990 budget
in uncharacteristic bipartisan spirit, but with top senators
conceding their spending plan is only a first step that leaves
deeper cuts to the future.
   On a 16-7 vote, the Senate Budget Committee approved a $1.16
trillion blueprint for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, a
document implementing the deficit-reduction pact reached last week
between the Bush administration and congressional leaders. Nine
Democrats and seven Republicans supported the proposal.
   The plan touts enough cuts to bring next year's deficit to $99.4
billion, less than the Gramm-Rudman law's $100 billion ceiling.
Critics say the savings are insufficient and illusory, relying on
overly rosey predictions of economic performance and one-time
savings like sales of federal assets.
   Many leading budget writers defend the agreement, saying it will
prepare them for the far more difficult task of coming up with a
1991 budget when the law requires a shortfall of no greater than
$64 billion.
   But before that will come the struggle by congressional tax
committees to find $5.3 billion in new taxes. Bush has championed a
reduction in the capital gains tax that he says will raise revenue
by stimulating the economy. Democrats have opposed the idea,
calling it a money-loser that benefits mainly the wealthy.
   Another $5.7 billion will have to come from sales of assets.
   The chairman of the Senate budget panel, Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,
noted that the 1990 spending plan sets the precedent of putting
``everything'' _ domestic and defense programs, and revenue sources
_ on the table in future budget talks.
   The budget committee's ranking Republican, Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., also defended the 1990 spending plan by saying it paves the
way for work on savings in 1991. ``It is not the best budget, but
it is an acceptable, workable budget and is better than any
alternative,'' he said.
   The 1990 spending blueprint would allow $299.2 billion in
spending for defense programs next year, a $4.8 billion cut in the
amount Bush proposed in the budget he presented Congress in
February.
   But none of the 20 other spending categories into which the
budget is divided were treated as harshly, and several came out as
winners.
   Spending for science and space programs would reach $14 billion,
a $400 million increase above the rate of inflation. Education and
employment programs would grow $300 million to $38.7 billion. And
law enforcement, driven largely by Congress' desire to finance
anti-drug efforts, would reach $10.2 billion, a $200 million
increase.
   Big savings would come from Medicare, the health program for the
elderly and handicapped, which would be trimmed by $2.6 billion to
$122.4 billion. Lawmakers expect the savings to come from
reductions in payments to doctors and hospitals.
   Agriculture spending would drop $2 billion to $15 billion,
environmental programs would be cut $700 million to $17.4 billion,
and veterans' programs would lose $700 million for a total of $29.8
billion.
   Housing and commerce programs would be slashed $2.2 billion to
$18.1 billion, but $1.8 billion of the drop would be a result of a
paper shift of the Postal Service to an ``off-budget'' account.
   As provided in the budget agreement announced last Friday, there
would be $19 billion in new spending for international affairs.
   By a 12-7 vote, the panel rejected an amendment by Sen. Kent
Conrad, D-N.D., that would have sent the congressional and
administration negotiators back to the table to seek deeper
savings. And on a 12-10 vote, they defeated a move by Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., that would have imposed $46 billion in deficit
reductions.
   The full Senate is expected to consider the budget resolution
when it returns in early May from its April recess. The House
Budget Committee plans to write its own version of the budget next
week.
   After congressional passage of a budget resolution, more than a
dozen laws will be needed to implement the spending and taxing
decisions it makes.

<HEAD>Food Price Rises Exceeding Projections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department economist says
consumer food prices are rising a bit faster than he and other
experts had expected and that a revised forecast may be in the
works.
   Ralph Parlett of the department's Economic Research Service said
Wednesday that price figures for the first three months of 1989
showed a number of major food items gained more than had been
projected earlier, including higher prices for fresh vegetables,
eggs, beef and fish.
   ``I think it's likely that (the 1989 forecast) will be revised
upward, but how far I don't care to speculate just now,'' he said.
   The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index showed Tuesday that
higher food and energy costs boosted prices 0.5 percent in March.
That resulted in a 6.1 percent annual inflation rate for the first
three months of 1989, the biggest quarterly rise in two years.
   Since last fall, the USDA has forecast that 1989 retail food
prices would gain 3 percent to 5 percent, an average for the entire
12 months of the year. The increase was 4.1 percent in 1988, the
same as in 1987.
   Parlett said in a telephone interview that the current forecast
still stands but that he and other economists are reviewing the
situation and that ``we might be looking at revising it in another
month or so.''
   Many factors that are uncertain now will begin to unfold more
clearly in the next few weeks, he said. Moisture conditions in some
of the major agricultural areas, including parts of the Great
Plains, are still critical and will have a lot to do with livestock
grazing and production later in the year.
   However, Parlett said he believes that ``we ought to start
getting some sort of moderation'' in consumer food prices in the
near future, barring a total upset.
   ``Part of the problem in the first quarter was fresh vegetables,
for example,'' he said. ``Now, we're coming into the season where
fresh vegetable prices will start to fall.''
   Egg prices, which have risen and then declined erratically for
months, may ease lower again and then level off, he said. Last
year's big cutbacks in laying hen flocks because of low profits
have been the main factor in the rise in egg prices.
   The biggest factor in consumer food prices is the livestock
sector, the beef, pork and poultry that add up to so much of family
grocery spending, Parlett said. And those items weigh most heavily
in the government's food price estimates.
   A report later Wednesday by Parlett's agency said that farmers
intend to boost crop plantings for the 1989 harvest. Most of those
crops are being planted this spring for harvest in the fall. An
exception is winter wheat, which was planted last fall, and some of
it is doing poorly.
   ``By mid-April, 76 percent of the Kansas winter wheat crop was
rated poor or very poor, reflecting ongoing drought, wind damage
and winterkill,'' the report said. ``Kansas usually produces about
17 percent of all U.S. wheat.''
   The report said the net cash income of farmers in 1989 is
expected to be in the range of $48 billion to $52 billion, down
from last year's record of $58 billion.
   Net cash income is the amount farmers have available to spend
during the year and represents the difference between gross cash
income and cash expenses. For example, despite last year's drought,
1988 sales of grain stored from previous harvests were counted as
part of the year's gross.
   This year's net cash income is expected to decline, partly
because farmers will have larger expenses as they expand crop
acreages, and also because federal subsidies will be lower.

   A monthly report by the Agriculture Department
says the outlook for summer water supplies improved in the Pacific
Northwest in March but declined in the Southwest because of
below-average rainfall and early snowmelt.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said Wednesday there was some much-needed moisture in
March but ``a good share of the West could use another month just
like it'' to make up for previous dry spells.
   Most of the Northwestern states received 120 percent or more of
their average monthly precipitation in March, he said. That
improved stream flow forecasts for Washington, Idaho, Montana,
northern California, northern Nevada, northern Wyoming and the Utah
panhandle.
   But the rest of the Western states received below-average
precipitation in most areas, and warm weather during March further
reduced the snowpack.
   The situation for water reserves stored in reservoirs looks
generally disappointing, except in parts of the Southwest.
   ``Reservoir storage continues well below average in most western
states due to the drought,'' Scaling said. ``It ranges from near
average in Utah and Oregon to 61 percent below average in Nevada.''
   Above-average runoff in recent years has left New Mexico's
reservoirs full, and current storage of water is 120 percent above
average, he said. Arizona is 13 percent above average, and
Colorado, 31 percent above.
   Snowmelt provides about 75 percent of the Western water supply,
including irrigation for farm crops.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Geneva Talks Will Mean Domestic Farm Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says the
federal government can compensate for any changes in American farm
policy recommended by negotiators at international trade talks.
   Responding to questioning before the Senate Agriculture
Committee, Yeutter said Wednesday that the point of the trade talks
is for all countries to remove subsidies that distort the
international marketplace.
   He said the United States can accommodate domestically for those
changes.
   ``Nothing precludes the Senate Agriculture Committee from making
the farmers whole, you just have to do it in a way that is not
trade distorting,'' he said.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., brought up the subject, saying farmers
from his state were worried they would suffer.
   ``No one is suggesting that we not be part of the
negotiations,'' he said. ``But there is a tension that exists
between being part of negotiations and having our position be
determined by a relatively few number of people.
   ``There is a sense that if the negotiators get their way, our
producers will be hurt.''
   Yeutter said trade distorting subsidies are a global problem
that will require adjustments by all countries.
   He sought to allay fears that U.S. farm policy was going to be
dictated by the Uruguay Round in Geneva, but said it would be naive
to think it should not be affected.
   ``If the Geneva negotiations are successful, we'll be writing a
segment of the European Community's 1991 farm bill,'' he said.
``We'll also be writing a major segment of the farm bills of
Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia and several other countries.
   ``If we wish to have an impact on those farm bills, it would be
unrealistic to expect the negotiations to have no effect on our own
legislation.''
   The discussion over the trade talks developed during a hearing
on the 1990 farm bill, which will determine the government's
overall policy toward agriculture for several years.
   The international trade talks are not expected to be complete
until 1991, but Congress can extend the 1985 law until the talks
are finished or write a new law that would be amended after the
negotiations.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who chairs the Agriculture Committee,
said Congress intends to go ahead with a new long-term farm bill.
   ``We can't forget that there are a number of issues covered by
the farm bill that are affected only indirectly _ or not at all by
the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations,''
he said.
   Yeutter agreed it would be in the best interests of the
non-trade portions of the law to go ahead with new legislation.
   His suggestions for the new farm bill included:
   _making programs more flexible so farmers have more control over
what they plant and how they use their acreage;
   _changing target price relationships to prevent farmers from
producing for government-financed storage;
   _limiting or eliminating large annual acreage reduction programs;
   _simplifying price and income support programs; and
   _devoting more attention to environmental and food safety
concerns.
   He said he wanted to find out if there was a feasible way to
pinpoint income supports with greater precision than in the past
and avoid the costs of having both crop insurance and emergency
disaster relief programs.
   ``If crop insurance has shortcomings, and I believe it does,
let's try to fix them in the 1990 farm bill or through separate
legislation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Groups Says 12 Nations Allow Theft of US Copyright Materials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A coalition of recording, film, book and
computer groups is targeting 12 nations where theft of copyright
materials and restrictive trade barriers are costing U.S.
businesses an estimated $1.4 billion a year.
   The International Intellectual Property Alliance said Wednesday
it was urging the Bush administration to maintain pressure on
foreign governments to curtail this massive loss of U.S. property.
   The alliance said their 1,600 member companies can only do so
much against piracy that often is condoned by foreign governments,
and the U.S. government must go to bat.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, told reporters his group was spending $40 million year to
fight estimated losses of $1 billion annually from piracy and lack
of market access.
   ``There comes a time when you've done all you can do and you
need the muscular arm of your government,'' Valenti said.
   ``The first step has to be government,'' concurred Jay Berman,
president of the Recording Industry Association of America, because
in most cases piracy ``goes on with government condonement.''
   The alliance said U.S. government intervention had helped cut by
half the estimated $1.3 billion that was lost to pirates in 10
nations in 1984. But problems remain, and while one nation,
Singapore, has been dropped from that list, three more were added
in 1988: The People's Republic of China, Saudi Arabia and India.
   Piracy losses totaled $418 million in China in 1988; $189
million in Saudi Arabia; and $123 million in India, the alliance
said. Another $30 million was lost in India due to lack of access,
the group said.
   In the 12 nations piracy still is costing U.S. companies $1.3
billion, said Eric Smith, general counsel to the alliance.
   Lack of access is costing American manufacturers an additional
$95 million, for a total piracy and market access loss of about
$1.4 billion annually, he said.
   Unless the 12 nations on the new list take meaningful measures
to shape up, they will be candidates for designation as a
``priority foreign country'' under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and
Competition Act, Smith said.
   That could mean the U.S. Trade Representative could conduct a
so-called Section 301 trade investigation against these nations,
leading ultimately to trade actions if necessary, Smith said.
   The 12 nations are: China, Saudi Arabia, Korea, India, the
Philippines, Taiwan, Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand, Nigeria
and Malaysia.
   Thanks to U.S. government pressure, piracy in Indonesia dropped
from $206 million to $45 million in the four-year period, while
piracy declined in Nigeria from $131 million to $22 million in the
period, the alliance said.
   Berman said that in recordings alone, piracy dropped from $400
million in 1984 to just $1 million in 1988 in Singapore and
Indonesia.
   ``The leverage provided by the 301 process has encouraged
countries to give attention to this problem,'' Smith said.
   Nicholas Veliotas, president of the Association of American
Publishers, said the International Trade Commission had estimated
that total losses of intellectual property to the United States,
such as patents, copyrights and trade secrets, ranged from $60
billion to $100 billion a year.
   Ronald Palenski, general counsel of the Computer Software and
Services Industry Association, said theft of computer software was
a particular problem in China in the hydroelectric and
manufacturing industries.
   Palenski said he didn't know if any of the pirated software had
military applications, but the piracy was done with the knowledge
of the Beijing government.
   ``I wouldn't call it government sponsored, but it's condoned,''
Palenski said.
   Smith said the loss figures were compiled from industry surveys.

   Five weeks after open heart surgery, actor
Carroll O'Connor publicly thanked fans and friends for their
encouragement and he offered some advice.
   O'Connor's full-page message Wednesday in the Hollywood Reporter
and Daily Variety entertainment industry newspapers coincidentally
appeared hours after comedian Lucille Ball underwent emergency
heart surgery.
   Jim Mahoney, a publicist for O'Connor, said the actor called
Miss Ball Wednesday to see how she was doing. O'Connor, currently
starring in TV's ``In the Heat of the Night,'' is recuperating in
Atlanta.
   In the newspaper ad, O'Connor, 64, said: ``When your good doctor
tells you to take the latest kind of cardiograph, and the latest is
miraculous in what it can reveal about your heart, don't postpone,
don't evade, don't content yourself with the fact that you're
feeling swell.''
   O'Connor, perhaps best known as blue-collar bigot Archie Bunker
in the ``All in the Family'' TV series, said he looks forward to
better health and ``possibly (though I hate making big promises),
to having a pleasanter personality.''

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and his wife, Tipper, say
they are thinking positively as their 6-year-old son recovers from
injuries suffered when he was struck by a car on April 3.
   ``It's been a difficult experience,'' Gore, D-Tenn., said
Wednesday. ``But it has been an experience that has certainly put a
lot of things into perspective and teaches you what's really
important in life.''
   ``It's drawn us closer as a family,'' Mrs. Gore said.
   Albert Gore III lost about 60 percent of his spleen as the
result of the accident and suffered a concussion, a bruised kidney,
lung and pancreas and a broken leg and a broken rib. He was hit
near Memorial Stadium as the family left the Baltimore Orioles'
season-opening baseball game. The boy was in satisfactory condition
Wednesday at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center.
   Words of encouragement have come in letters from thousands of
people, including many cards written by children who had suffered
through similar experiences, said Gore, a Democratic candidate for
president in 1988.
   ``The number of drawings and cards has just been incredible. ...
His hospital room doesn't have any bare wall space in it,'' he said.

   After two days of meetings with
government and opposition officials, former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter said the international relief effort in Sudan would only
temporarily help the country.
   The country has had six years of civil war, an influx of
refugees and severe water shortages in refugee camps.
   Carter traveled to Ethiopia on Wednesday to meet with leaders of
the south Sudan rebels after his peace talks in Sudan.
   When he left Sudan, the former president said in a statement
that the country needed peace before it could solve its problems.
The rebels took up arms in 1983 to demand greater autonomy,
political, economic and administrative reforms.

   The opening of singer Carly Simon's art gallery
will help children in need and drug and alcohol addicts.
   Riverrun Gallery will open May 2 with an exhibition featuring
three of the Oscar-winning singer's favorite artists.
   The gallery will donate funds from the opening to the Hazelden
Foundation in Minneapolis and the Association to Benefit Children
in New York.
   Hazelden is a non-profit drug and alcohol rehabilitation center;
ABC takes care of children who are homeless or afflicted with AIDS.
   The gallery is expected to put on four shows per year, said Gina
Silvester, one of two friends working with Simon on Riverrun. The
debut exhibition will feature artists from Martha's Vineyard, where
Simon has a home.
   ``The concept for the first show is Carly Simon's. These are the
artists she's collected for 10 years,'' said Silvester.
   Simon won an Academy Award last month for ``Let The River Run,''
the theme for the movie ``Working Girl.''

in New Orleans. They met in October 1987 when Goodman was in
Louisiana filming ``Everybody's All American,'' Stan Rosenfield,
Goodman's agent, said Wednesday from Hollywood.
   Rosenfield said Goodman proposed on Saturday. The wedding will
be in October in New Orleans, but no specifics were released.
   ``Because of the enormous amount of curiosity about them, they
will not announce the date. They don't want a recurrence of the
Sean Penn and Madonna incident,'' Rosenfield said.
   Reporters and photographers disrupted that wedding when they

<HEAD>Officials Want To Change Town's Queen City Nickname</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARQUETTE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Municipal leaders want to change their
town's ``Queen City'' nickname to ``Superior Location'' because
they think the current moniker might be misinterpreted.
   ``It has come to my attention that there has been a resurgence
of the use of the phrase `Queen City' to describe the city of
Marquette,'' City Manager David Svanda said in a recent letter to
community leaders.
   ``The term's negative connotations conjured by many people do
not give justice to all that the Marquette area has to offer.''
   Visitors might think Queen City refers to homosexuals, said
Mayor Robert Berube.
   Marquette historian Fred Rydholm, who is writing a history of
the Lake Superior port of 23,280 people, said that was silly.
Svanda's request is ``the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard,''
Rydholm said.
   The Queen City nickname originated after a 1868 fire, when an
ordinance required all buildings in the center city area to be
rebuilt with stone or masonry, he said.
   Visitors expecting to see the wood construction of other Upper
Peninsula towns in Michigan instead were greeted with tall spires
of stone.
   ``There was nothing from Seattle to Buffalo like it in the
north, and it was also the best port on Lake Superior, so it was
called the Queen City of the North,'' Rydholm said.

   Adnan Khashoggi's jail cell is only a five-minute
walk from the luxury hotel where the jet-setting Saudi financier
and arms dealer was staying before his arrest.
   Although the conditions are better than in many other Swiss
jails, they are far being from the plush surroundings to which he
is accustomed.
   Khashoggi, once reputed to be among the world's richest men,
does not have to wear prison clothes and can order out for meals,
some of which he has had delivered from the Schweizerhof hotel.
   He was staying at the hotel in Bern, the Swiss capital, when he
was arrested Tuesday on a U.S. warrant charging he helped ousted
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda hide
riches stolen from their country.
   The 54-year-old Khashoggi was allegedly the main middleman and
financier in the Iran-Contra affair and has been involved in
several kickback scandals. But this is the first time he's been
arrested.
   He has been held in a downtown Bern jail reserved for people in
pretrial protective custody.
   Like most prisoners there, he has a room to himself. It measures
about 30 square feet and is furnished with a bed, table, chair,
sink and toilet.
   ``All the furniture is bolted down,'' said Bern investigating
magistrate Alexander Tschappat.
   A radio is in the room and Khashoggi can rent a television for
one franc (about 60 cents) a day.
   ``He can also read and write and buy newspapers. But he can't
have technical things like a telephone,'' Tschappat said.
   Khashoggi is not receiving special treatment, Tschappat said in
a telephone interview.
   He said all prisoners could keep their watches and other
personal belongings with them, such as family photos _ ``but you
usually deposit all your valuables so there is no danger of
something being stolen.''
   Inmates can receive visitors three days a week for two hours in
the afternoon, Tschappat said.
   He said prisoners can exercise regularly, though the prison ``is
not a big place. You can't play tennis or anything.''
   The prison holds about 110 inmates, and is ``usually fully
booked,'' he said.
   Swiss legal sources said Wednesday that Khashoggi likely will
have to stay in jail until the Justice Ministry rules on an
extradition request that United States has said it would file
within 60 days.
   If the Swiss approve the demand, Khashoggi can appeal to the
Federal Tribunal, Switzerland's supreme court, a process that could
take months.
   Swiss law also allows him to turn himself over to U.S.
authorities before the extradition request arrives. He could then
seek release on bail in the United States.
   But even then, the United States would have to submit the
extradition request for a ruling by Swiss authorities. It will be
needed because Switzerland does not allow extradited suspects to be
tried abroad on charges not considered criminal under Swiss law.
   Khashoggi is charged in a U.S. indictment with racketeering,
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and mail fraud by posing as the
owner of some of the allegedly stolen Philippine assets to protect
them against possible seizure.
   If convicted, he could draw up to 65 years in prison.

<TEXT>
   The world's oceans and seas have been warming at
about one-fifth of a degree Fahrenheit a year, about twice as fast
as previous observations indicated, says a study published today.
   The new work is based on satellite observations, which provide
more complete information than previous data from ships and buoys,
said researcher A.E. Strong.
   The increase in sea-surface temperatures was observed from
January 1982 to mid-1988, Strong reports in today's issue of the
British journal Nature.
   The observed rate is faster than most scientists have expected
from the greenhouse effect, a predicted global warming due to
buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, Strong
said in a telephone interview.
   But it is premature to regard the findings as evidence of the
greenhouse effect, said Strong, a research oceanographer with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and currently a
visiting scientist at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.
   The findings may reflect only a temporary change rather than the
long-term warming predicted from the greenhouse effect, he said.
Researchers lack comparable satellite data from previous years for
longer-term analysis, he said.
   The average water temperature actually dropped about nine-tenths
of a degree during 1988, but has risen about two-fifths of a degree
this year through March, reaching a mark of about 66 degrees, he
said.
   The averages were derived from some 2 million to 3 million
satellite observations a month, covering a global band that extends
as far north as the southern tip of Greenland and farther south
than the tip of South America.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somehow from war-battered Lebanon, paintings and
drawings by its artists spanning 200 years have reached the British
capital for an exhibition opening today.
   Some of the 270 works have been restored after damage by bullets
and knife cuts by vandals. One retains a shrapnel hole. Three of
the 70 artists whose works are displayed in the show have been
killed.
   A 19th century portrait by Habib Srour had hung on a wall that
was later destroyed by a shell after the painting left for London.
   ``You have saved my grandfather,'' the exhibition committee
heard from a grandson of the artist.
   Zeina Toutounji, one of the organizers, is a niece of the wife
of Spanish ambassador Don Pedro Manuel De Aristegui, who was killed
by a shell in his Beirut house on Sunday.
   ``I feel terrible about what is happening in my country. These
paintings say this is not our war, that we have nothing to do with
the war _ that is the message of the artists,'' said Myrna Bustani,
a businesswoman who commutes between Beirut and London and helped
put the exhibition together.
   ``I was last in Beirut in January looking for paintings; there
is not much business these days,'' she said, forcing a smile.
   ``The truck taking the paintings to the port was stopped four
times by shelling and had to turn back,'' Mrs. Bustani said.
   None of the 30 artists and lenders in Lebanon who were invited
was able to leave the country, she said.
   Of the artists who have been killed, Khalil Zgaib was shot by a
sniper on his balcony and Ibrahim Marzouk was killed by bomb
shrapnel as he stood in line to buy bread in 1975 when the civil
war between Christians and Moslems broke out.
   Suha Tuqan was shot in 1986 by unidentified gunmen who fired at
her car as she tried to save a French journalist from being
kidnapped. The Frenchman was injured but escaped.
   The exhibition, ``Lebanon: The Artist's View,'' through June 2
at the Barbican Center, starts in 1787 with portraits of Greek
Orthodox bishops, followed by dignitaries and politicians.
   It proceeds through landscapes of beauty and tranquility,
houses, gardens, fountains, baths, flowers, brightly colored
abstracts and scenes of the emancipation of women, to the horrors
of the present fighting.
   The serenity of the scene changes with ``Wounded Militiamen in
Hospital,'' painted in 1976 by Seta Manoukian, who now lives in the
United States.
   A woman and a cat sheltering underground during the Israeli
siege of Beirut in 1982, by Farid Mansour, hangs beside the
artist's haggard self-portrait done at the same time, when he was
almost starving.
   The show, staged by the British Lebanese Association, took three
years to organize and the paintings reached London late in March.
   Of the 270 works, 210 came from private collectors and
institutions in Beirut like the National Library and the American
University and the others from outside Lebanon.

<HEAD>Ban on Assault Weapons Moving in Senate But Problems Remain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed ban on assault weapons sales took a
small step forward in the Senate as gun-control forces put off
difficult decisions that already have divided lawmakers.
   The legislation ``will help prevent our law enforcement officers
from being gunned down by drug dealers,'' Sen. Howard M.
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, declared as a Senate Judiciary subcommittee
cleared both his measure and a rival version 5-1.
   The panel's action, which did not include a recommendation of
approval, places the issue before the full Senate Judiciary
Committee, which is expected to take up the measures next month.
   Metzenbaum's bill, which has been modified somewhat over the
last week, would ban sales of new assault weapons but not transfers
of ones that already are owned by the public. It would require
owners selling their guns to keep a record to make it easier to
trace firearms found at crime scenes.
   The measure also would require a 14-day waiting period before
transfers. It specifies a list of 26 assault guns ranging from the
AKS, a semiautomatic cousin of the Soviet infantryman's AK47, to
sinister-looking Street Sweeper and Striker 12 round-drummed
shotguns.
   Also approved by the panel was a rival version sponsored by Sen.
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., that specifies nine guns the senator
says are frequently used by narcotics gangs. It does not include a
waiting period for transfers.
   In approving both bills without a recommendation, the
subcommittee on the Constitution merely put off resolving the
disputes between the two, as well as the inevitable battle with
forces opposed to any crackdown on assault weapons. Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, vowed to introduce still another bill that would
take the stress off of gun control and put the emphasis on crime
control.
   ``The only assault these so-called assault weapons bills make is
on the legitimate, law-abiding citizens,'' Hatch declared. He said
both measures would ``transgress the Second Amendment rights (to
bear arms) guaranteed to all law-abiding citizens in our society.''
   Defining assault weapons has posed a major problem for their
critics, but they generally are semiautomatic rifles and pistols
with military styling as well as folding and plastic stocks,
forward hand grips and other features more often seen in Rambo
movies than in a traditional woodsman's gun rack.
   Crack gangs warring over turf have been using the rapid-firing,
high-powered weapons to spray street corners in some communities.
But authorities also say there is no functional difference between
the assault rifles and the semiautomatic versions of traditional
hunting rifles with their brown wooden stocks.
   The National Rifle Association has been highly critical of
Metzenbaum's bill, and DeConcini said he expected the same kind of
opposition to his measure, even though he has a strong pro-gun
voting record. Metzenbaum registered a strongly worded complaint
against the power of gun groups.
   ``As I know so well, any legislative initiative dealing with
firearms, no matter how modest and reasonable, is inevitably
attacked by the gun lobby as a threat to sportsmen and legitimate
gun owners,'' he said. ``I am sure Sen. DeConcini will be attacked
as well, even though he has introduced a modest and careful
measure.''
   Lawmakers are also divided over whether they should await a cue
from President Bush before taking the next step.
   ``I think we can make up our minds without hearing from
President Bush on this,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   He urged speed, saying that ``the American people want action.''
   ``We didn't have the guts to face up to the handguns and the
issue of concealable guns and now the question is whether we are
going to have the guts to face up to assault weapons,'' he said.
   DeConcini and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., however, said lawmakers
should get Bush administration input lest the president veto the
finished product. They said support to override a veto and pass
such a bill over the president's objections could well be missing.
   ``If we don't think we've got the administration's support, I
don't think we can push a bill,'' DeConcini said.
   The administration has banned imports of many assault weapons
but many of them are made in America.
   The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms says that before Bush imposed his temporary import ban,
foreign-made weapons accounted for about 25 percent of the American
market.

   Federal regulators have filed legal actions
seeking $34.9 million in repayments as a result of the failure of
two S&amp;Ls.
   The government's civil complaints seek to recoup the money from
four brokerage firms, including two of the nation's largest:
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Prudential-Bache Securities.
   The firms were accused of running up losses of at least $25.9
million at two S&amp;Ls in Colorado and Oklahoma that are now insolvent.
   The government on Wednesday accused the brokerage firms of using
funds from the S&amp;Ls to purchase highly speculative futures and
options contracts.
   The complaints involve the now-defunct Key Savings and Loan
Association of Englewood, Colo., and the former Universal Savings
and Loan Association of Chickasha, Okla. The two institutions were
declared insolvent and taken over by the government in February
1987.
   The complaints, brought by the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., also named as defendants five commodity program
salesmen, who either now work or once worked for the firms.
   FSLIC, which insures S&amp;L deposits up to $100,000, has the task
of trying to recoup costs incurred when an S&amp;L fails.
   Federal officials have estimated that one in four S&amp;L failures
is the direct result of fraud, but critics have charged that
regulators have been slow to prosecute these cases.
   President Bush, in announcing his S&amp;L bailout plan in February,
promised to step up efforts to recover at least a portion of the
billions of dollars that were embezzled or lost at failed S&amp;Ls.
   The Senate approved its version of the S&amp;L bailout package on
Wednesday, a measure that provides $157 billion over the next two
decades, with two-thirds of that coming from taxpayers.
   The FSLIC actions, filed over the past three weeks in federal
courts in Denver and Oklahoma City and before the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, were not announced until Wednesday.
   Shearson-Lehman was accused of involving Key Savings in a
computer-driven trading system in 1985 and 1986 on futures and
options in violation of federal regulations governing the soundness
of S&amp;L investments.
   The complaint also named as defendants Shearson salesman Douglas
J. Shaw and former Shearson salesmen Earl Pettet and Arthur Donald
Robb Jr. The complaint, which was filed before the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, seeks at least $9.7 million in damages,
including the return of $1.1 million in commissions.
   FSLIC also filed a $7.4 million suit in U.S. District Court in
Denver against Francis ``Bud'' Hildenbrand, who allegedly took over
a portion of Key's trading account in November 1985 after the
institution terminated its relationship with Pettet.
   A third complaint, filed against Prudential Bache and Robb,
alleges that Prudential-Bache shared Key's trading account with
Shearson Lehman after Robb left Shearson to join Prudential-Bache.
That complaint, filed with the CFTC, seeks at least $2.8 million in
damages.
   Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Prudential-Bache in New York,
said the brokerage firm would vigorously fight the charges.
   ``The firm contends that it did not act improperly and the
trading done in the account was done with the full knowledge and
instructions of the savings and loan,'' he said.
   FSLIC also filed suit in federal court in Oklahoma City seeking
at least $15 million in damages against two other brokerage firms,
Geldermann Inc. of Chicago and UMIC Inc. of Memphis, along with
UMIC sales representative Charles Alex Denny.
   The Oklahoma City suit alleges that futures and options trading
done by the brokerage firms resulted in more than $6 million in
losses at Universal Savings.
   The civil suit also named as defendants three former executives
connected with Universal Savings, Arthur A. Wallace, the president
of Universal; Gregg Crosby, vice president of Universal Futures
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the S&amp;L; and Bryan Green, former
vice president of the S&amp;L.
   Officials from the other brokerage firms did not return
telephone calls asking for comment.

   Radicals and Republicans, celebrities
and neighbors turned out to honor Abbie Hoffman as a wisecracking
gadfly who stayed true to his anti-Establishment convictions.
   ``He didn't change his ideals when the ideological fashion
changed,'' said his cousin, newspaper columnist Sydney Schanberg.
``He stood up against arbitrary power, capricious power and
arrogant and callous power.
   ``In other words, he stood up against bullies. I think that's
why we cared about Abbie so much, because he had the courage for
the rest of us,'' said Schanberg, whose experiences as a
correspondent in Cambodia were the basis for the Oscar-winning
movie ``The Killing Fields.''
   At least 900 people packed Temple Emanuel on Wednesday in memory
of the 1960s activist. Outside, an overflow crowd of more than 100
stood listening to the service over a loudspeaker. Hoffman's body
was cremated.
   The turnout included ``Easy Rider'' producer Bert Schneider,
former basketball star Bill Walton and folk singer Pete Seeger, who
led hundreds of mourners from Hoffman's childhood home to the
synagogue a few blocks away, singing ``Abbie's spirit is still
alive'' to the gospel song ``Down by the Riverside.''
   Hoffman, 52, was found dead at his home near New Hope, Pa., on
April 12. A coroner ruled Tuesday that he committed suicide with an
overdose of barbiturates mixed with alcohol.
   Friends and relatives said Hoffman had been suffering pain from
a recent car accident, but they doubted he took his own life.
   ``As a friend, it is my belief Abbie died of an overdose of
caring and love,'' said Schneider, who with actor Jack Nicholson
helped hide Hoffman while he was a fugitive from justice in the
1970s to avoid trial on cocaine possession charges.
   Hoffman gained fame as part of the Chicago Seven, a group of
radicals who were tried on charges of conspiring to disrupt the
bloody 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Hoffman and
four others were acquitted of conspiracy but convicted of crossing
state lines with intent to riot. Their convictions were overturned.
   Jerry Rubin, one of the Chicago Seven, said: ``I think Abbie
felt the pain of the world and exploded.''
   Mourners ranged from gray-suited businessmen to long-haired
colleagues from Hoffman's days as founder of the Yippie movement,
or Youth International Party, a loosely knit group of radicals to
protest the government and the Vietnam War.
   Among them were Aron Kay, who made a name for himself by
throwing pies in faces of public officials.
   ``Abbie was a man who had guts and chutzpah. He was a true
patriot,'' said Kay, who wore a tie-dyed T-shirt and hat knit of
rainbow-colored wool with a Yippie pin stuck in it.
   ``Abbie was my hero,'' said Jay Severan, a Republican political
consultant from New York City. ``He was the first and best media
consultant I ever knew.''
   Schanberg read excerpts from Hoffman's closing arguments in his
1987 trial in Northampton on trespassing charges stemming from his
arrest at an anti-CIA demonstration with Amy Carter, daughter of
former President Carter. Hoffman and the other defendants were
acquitted of the charges.
   ``I grew up with the idea that democracy is not something you
believe in or a place you hang your hat, but it's something you
do,'' Hoffman told the jury. ``You participate. If you stop doing
it, democracy crumbles and falls apart.''

<HEAD>Drug Eradication Abroad is a Limited Strategy, Moynihan Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States can expect only limited
cooperation from foreign countries in the war against drugs,
because most drug-supplying countries have weak or hostile
governments, according to Senate testimony.
   Where the countries have strong central governments and are
allies of the United States _ such as France and Turkey _ the
cooperation is much easier to obtain, said Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan,
D-N.Y., who submitted a written statement to the Senate Caucus on
International Narcotics Control.
   Moynihan recalled his trip to those countries in 1968 when their
heroin exports were a major problem and he was an assistant to
President Nixon.
   ``Both Turkey and France had strong central governments capable,
if they chose, of doing what we asked them to do,'' he said in a
statement Wednesday. ``Further, each was a military ally of the
United States, which is to say we were all members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.''
   He said Turkey was able to stop farmers from selling opium to
traffickers and France curbed the conversion into heroin. But he
added that success there had was counteracted by failure with
governments that have a weak grip on their countries.
   ``Peru, Burma and Afghanistan face violent civil war,'' he said.
``Laos, Afghanistan and Iran are openly hostile to the United
States. Brazil has uncounted square miles where government
authority is limited.''
   Moynihan argued that money is better spent on treating addicts
at home.
   ``A 10 percent success rate in treatment is meaningful in a way
that a 10 percent success rate in eradication (of crops) is not,''
he said.
   Moynihan's reference to Turkey was supported by Robert S.
Dillon, a former U.S. ambassador there. Dillon attributed success
in Turkey to U.S. financing of a factory to process the raw opium
for medical use and the ability of the Turkish government to
control the trade.
   Diego Asencio, former U.S. ambassador to Colombia, emphasized
that U.S. spending to fight drugs abroad is low compared with sums
expended at home. He pointed to the $70 million that William J.
Bennett, in charge of federal drug programs, wants to use in
Washington alone.
   ``Spending $14 or $15 million in Mexico is a joke,'' he said.
``It's not indicative of a serious program.''
   He described U.S. policy in Latin America as designed to
embarrass other governments into using their own resources against
drugs. That was not effective because it encourages lip service by
those governments rather than action, he added.

<HEAD>Administration Concedes Committee Missed Some Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says the congressional
Iran-Contra committees never saw two recently-released politically
sensitive documents but denies there were any efforts to conceal
them, according to a published report.
   An unnamed administration official told The Washington Post the
documents were in an archive whose contents were available to the
committees if they specifically requested them. But the panels
never asked to see the documents, the official said.
   One document refers to then-Vice President George Bush's secret
involvement in a deal to reward Honduras for aiding the Nicaraguan
Contras, the newspaper reported in today's editions.
   The paper said the official's account left open the possibility
the committees would not have known the contents of the documents
in question and would not have known to request them.
   Key members of the Iran-Contra panels have raised the
possibility that several important White House documents on former
President Reagan and Bush's role in efforts to reward those aiding
the Contras were withheld from the House and Senate panels.
   Bush has said twice that the documents, which were released
during the trial of former White House aide Oliver North, were
``available'' to the Iran-Contra committees.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday night the
documents in North's National Security Council office were
immediately seized by the FBI and sealed up on the late November
1986 weekend during the initial inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair
by then Attorney General Edwin Meese.
   He added that the documents had been in the joint custody of the
White House and the FBI and said the White House had at least
partial custody because many of the documents were classified.
   He said the White House had ``some say'' in the way the
documents were dispersed, but he insisted that at no time were they
off-limits to the committees.

<HEAD>Fish Oil Lowers Mild High Blood Pressure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three evil-tasting tablespoons of herring oil each
day can lower mildly elevated blood pressure, providing some of the
best evidence yet that fish oil is good for the heart, scientists
reported today.
   Although the seeming benefits of fish oil have been widely
touted, little hard evidence has been offered to back up these
claims. Now, two researchers skeptical about fish oil's powers say
they have surprised even themselves by finding that it seems to
work.
   Their study, conducted on 32 men, found that big daily doses can
return mild high blood pressure to normal levels. It appeared to
work about as well as diuretics or the beta blocker propranolol,
two medicines widely prescribed for high blood pressure.
   ``It opens the possibility that this type of therapy may
ultimately find a place in the treatment of high blood pressure,''
said Dr. Garret A. FitzGerald, who with Dr. Howard R. Knapp
conducted the study at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
   ``It's an important first step in that direction,'' FitzGerald
said. ``Given an adequate dosage, fish oil appears to lower blood
pressure in people with elevated high blood pressure.''
   The amount of fish oil used in this experiment was much higher
than that recommended by manufacturers of the fish oil gel capsules
sold in grocery stores and pharmacies. In fact, when taken at the
dose usually suggested, the oil did not help.
   Other studies have suggested that fish oil can prevent heart
disease by repairing damaged arteries, lowering dangerously high
cholesterol levels and making the blood more slow to clot.
   Despite their encouraging findings, the Vanderbilt researchers
said people should not exchange their blood pressure pills for fish
oil until doctors know more about its effectiveness and safety.
   At Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, Dr. Richard Pasternak noted
that several large studies are under way, adding:
   ``This research is consistent with other experimental evidence,
and this is an important break in that regard.''
   According to the latest report, published in today's New England
Journal of Medicine, a month of fish oil lowered the men's average
blood pressure from the starting point of 139 over 94 to 132 over
90.
   To achieve this, they had to take three tablespoons of herring
oil daily. The liquid oil, which caused belching and a lingering
fishy aftertaste, is not widely available because it spoils quickly.
   The amount taken is the equivalent of 50 fish oil gel capsules,
like those sold in supermarkets and drugstores. Knapp said taking
that many is impractical because big doses of them often cause
upset stomachs.
   The doctors also cautioned that people should not substitute cod
liver oil, which contains too much vitamin A and D and not enough
omega-3 fatty acids. Oily ocean fish, such as herring and mackerel,
are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the particular variety of fish oil
that appears to be good for the heart.
   Herring oil used in the study was about 30 percent omega-3. The
doctors noted that more concentrated kinds of fish oil are becoming
available. These may allow people to get fish oil's benefits while
taking less.
   ``Fish oil is not the drug of choice for treating hypertension,
but the study shows that that dietary change can markedly reduce
our risk of high blood pressure,'' said Dr. Mark Milner of
Washington Hospital Center.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador, President-elect: Rebel Attacks Are Provocatory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas have
launched an assassination and bombing campaign to try to provoke
human rights abuses by the armed forces and new government, the
president-elect and U.S. ambassador say.
   The rebels say the armed forces and authorities of the rightist
government-elect are increasing repression in preparation for a
``total war'' against suspected leftists.
   Alfredo Cristiani, who was elected president last month and
takes office June 1, and U.S. Ambassador William Walker made their
comments during separate meetings Wednesday with foreign
correspondents.
   Their analyses came shortly after the assassination of Attorney
General Roberto Garcia Alvarado when a bomb placed on the roof of
his Jeep Cherokee exploded while the vehicle was stopped at a
traffic light.
   Any increase in rights abuses by the armed forces and the new
government, both men said, would be used by guerrilla supporters in
the United States to lobby for a cutoff in vital U.S. aid to El
Salvador.
   ``They (the guerrillas) are not going to achieve that,'' said
Cristiani, leader of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance,
or Arena.
   Arena and the U.S. Embassy have blamed the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front for three assassinations since
mid-February and for the bombing Friday of the house of Francisco
Merino, the vice president-elect.
   One person was slightly injured in the attack on Merino's house.
   The guerrillas have claimed responsibility for the recent
slayings of Miguel Castellanos, a former rebel
commander-turned-government informer, and Francisco Peccorini, a
rightist academic.
   The insurgents denied responsibility for the bombing of Merino's
house. There has been no claim of responsibility for Garcia's
killing.
   ``The guerrillas are quite obviously attempting to provoke a
nasty, violent reaction from the government, the elected government
or the armed forces to their acts of barbarism,'' said Walker.
   ``The provocation is coming from one side. They (the rebels) are
trying to drag this place back to the early 1980s,'' he said.
   Walker was referring to a period when rightist death squads were
killing hundreds of suspected leftists each month. Local and
international human rights groups, as well as former U.S.
diplomats, link still-active Arena leaders such as Roberto
D'Aubuisson to the death squads.
   The party denies the allegations.
   ``The terrorists are trying to provoke an uncontrolled, vengeful
reaction,'' said Cristiani. ``They would then exploit that abroad
to politically isolate the new government and cut off aid.''
   Several left-of-center labor and rights organizations disagree
with both men's contention that the provocation is coming from one
side only.
   ANDES, the biggest teachers' union, has blamed military-linked
death squads for the abduction and assassination of two teachers
since late February.
   Maria Cristina Gomez, a union and feminist activist, was
abducted by heavily armed civilians as she left school April 5 and
shoved into a dark-windowed Jeep Cherokee, witnesses said. Her
bullet-riddled body _ the skin of her back and arms peeled away by
acid _ was discovered an hour later.
   Dark-windowed Jeeps are a sort of trademark vehicle for death
squads.
   Walker said he and other embassy officials have met with Arena
leaders to encourage them to pursue ``a rational, reasoned
response'' to guerrilla violence.
   In a related development, government forces killed an Argentine
doctor and a French nurse who worked with leftist guerrillas, the
armed forces and the rebels said Wednesday.
   An armed forces communique identified the foreigners as Gustavo
Islas Caceres of Argentina and Madelaine Languedoc of France.
   Clandestine rebel radio said Islas Caceres, Languedoc, and three
Salvadoran rebels were killed Saturday after being captured during
an army attack on a rebel field hospital in the eastern province of
San Vicente.
   The armed forces said the foreigners were guerrilla fighters who
were killed in combat along with seven Salvadoran rebels.
   Walker said the embassy had concluded the foreigners were killed
in combat about 30 miles east of the capital.

<HEAD>Administration Urges Court to Ban of Dial-a-Porn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress had its eye on voters more than the
Constitution when it banned the $2 billion ``dial-a-porn'' business
last election year, an attorney for one of the larger telephone
message services told the Supreme Court.
   But a Justice Department lawyer arguing in favor of banning all
dial-up services offering sexually explicit telephone messages says
the law is needed to ``protect children from hearing patently
offensive speech.''
   The court, which heard arguments Wednesday in a California case,
must determine whether the lawmakers can issue an outright ban that
fails to distinguish between indecent and obscene material.
   The justices will also be looking at whether technological
safeguards exist to prevent children from dialing the service's 976
numbers. The 976 exchanges also are used for other,
non-controversial types of messages such as sport scores, time
checks and weather reports.
   Born in 1983, the dial-a-porn industry matured quickly. In 1984,
Justice Department Richard Taranto said, 180 million such calls
were placed by customers in New York alone. The industry's income
last year topped $2 billion, he said.
   Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, representing a dial-a-porn
service known as Sable Communications, said the availability of
technical safeguards ``makes this flat ban illegitimate.''
   When Justice Byron R. White asked Tribe why Congress passed the
total ban, Tribe responded, ``That's not a hard question, it was an
election year.''
   ``I didn't say it was hard,'' White said as laughter filled the
courtroom.
   The total ban on dial-a-porn never was imposed because a federal
judge in California ruled that the 1988 law could be applied only
to obscene, not merely indecent, phone messages.
   U.S. District Judge Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles said
outlawing non-obscene messages, even though they may be
inappropriate for minors, violates the free-speech protections of
the Constitution's First Amendment. The government appealed the
ruling to the Supreme Court.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said Wednesday she doubted whether
the proposed ban meets the ``least restrictive means'' test the
court has used when scrutinizing governmental interference based on
speech content.
   She asked the government's lawyer why technological safeguards
such as scrambling devices or access codes could not provide ``a
feasible and effective way to preserve the states' compelling
interest in protecting children'' while allowing adult access to
such services.
   Taranto answered that the various safeguards contain
``significant loopholes.''
   When Justice Antonin Scalia suggested the case involved material
on the borderline of what is constitutionally protected, Tribe
disagreed.
   Tribe said many of the telephone messages at issue are ``merely
suggestive'' and not at all sexually explicit.
   Other dial-a-porn messages, Tribe said, cannot be distinguished
``from a lot of what's in R-rated movies and racy novels.''
   But Scalia responded, ``I don't think that's where the money
is.''
   Past Supreme Court decisions have excluded obscene material _
but not all sexually explicit or indecent material _ from
constitutional free-speech protections.
   The court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that
appeals to a morbid interest in sex with patently offensive
depictions or descriptions of sexual conduct, and one that taken as
a whole has no serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.
   Congress in 1983 attempted to protect children by imposing
restrictions on dial-a-porn services but did not seek a total ban
until 1988. The ban was challenged by Sable, which offers
dial-a-porn services in many states.
   The 1983 measure allowed government regulators to impose
restrictions aimed at limiting children's access to dial-a-porn
messages. Those restrictions included requiring dial-a-porn
services to accept only credit card calls and to operate at times
when parents most likely would be available to supervise their
children's actions.

   Two death row inmates constructed
dummies, squeezed through a small air vent and were sawing their
way out of prison when they were caught, but they say the two hours
of ``freedom'' were worth it.
   ``You can't blame a guy for trying,'' says James Paster.
   He made the comment in an interview Wednesday, a week after he
and cellmate Noble Mays wiggled out their cell and into a utility
corridor where they tried to saw through a ceiling exhaust fan.
   Said Paster: ``I felt like I was doing something for myself
instead of waiting for relief from the very people who had sent me
here.''
   Mays added: ``You just try to work as fast as you can and as
quiet as you can. I wasn't out to hurt anybody.''
   Paster, 44, a former lounge singer and Elvis Presley
impersonator, is awaiting death for a 1980 contract killing in
Houston. Mays, 35, was sentenced to die for a 1979 robbery and
stabbing death in Wichita Falls.
   Guards noticed the pair was missing in the early hours of April
11 when a nurse who was supposed to give Mays some medication could
not awaken him from outside the pair's cell.
   When guards opened the cell door, they discovered the men in the
bunks really were dummies made of clothing stuffed with newspapers
and tobacco cans.
   They also discovered the tiny vent to a corridor behind the
cells was really cardboard.
   Mays and Paster were discovered hiding above some pipes, about
15 to 20 feet from their cell. With Paster acting as lookout, Mays
was trying to saw through bars that blocked a large exhaust fan to
the roof on their wing of the Ellis Unit of the Texas Department of
Corrections outside Huntsville.
   ``The next stop would have put you about 100 yards from the
fence,'' Mays said.
   Now, the two are confined in separate cells known as
administrative segregation, the maximum security on the Texas death
row. They also have been barred from participating in the death-row
work program.
   Prison officials say no inmates have ever escaped from death row
at the Ellis Unit.
   But that didn't deter Mays.
   ``What are they going to do to me?'' he said. ``We weren't out
to hurt anybody. Neither of us had weapons or anything.
   ``I'm sure everybody would love to pull something like that
off,'' he said.
   Both men laughed about how they must have looked as they
struggled to fit through the tiny vent that led outside their cell.
   ``I still don't know how I got out,'' Mays said.
   ``I still got pieces of my hide hanging there,'' Paster added.
   Paster said Mays went through the hole first _ and then got
stuck.
   ``I greased him up while he was caught up in there,'' Paster
said. ``After I quit laughing so hard, I finally decided to grease
him up.''
   He said he used several bottles of hair tonic as a lubricant.
   Both men said a guard patrolling the area came so close to
finding them that they could have touched him. But Mays had
unscrewed a light bulb, making it difficult to see.
   Paster said they came up with idea to flee about a month ago
while playing chess.
   ``Noble said it was my move,'' he said. ``I said I had a better
idea.''

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Share Prices Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished higher Thursday against
the Japanese yen in Tokyo, while share prices declined.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which closed at a record high of 33,363.83 on
Wednesday, shed 178.68 points, or 0.54 percent, to finish trading
at 33,185.15.
   The dollar ended the day at 132.28 yen, up 0.40 yen from
Wednesday's closing of 131.88 yen. The U.S. currency opened at
132.40 yen and ranged from 132.10 to 132.47 yen during the day.
   Traders said the dollar-yen trading moved in a narrow range as
players continued to make position adjustments in the wake of the
Tuesday release of the March U.S. consumer price index. The figure,
a 0.5-percent increase, slightly up from February's 0.4 percent,
indicated a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
   Toshio Kiri of the Bank of Tokyo attributed the dollar'shigher
opening in Tokyo to similar trends on overseas markets in the wake
of higher oil prices.
   But the U.S. currency gradually eased due to dollar-selling by
export companies, he said.
   The majority of Japanese investors, however, made only minor
technical adjustments, Kiri said.
   ``Even though investors start selling the dollar, it is unlikely
to fall further because the currency's still quite strong,'' he
said.
   On the stock market, a rise in oil prices, triggered by a North
Sea gas explosion, discouraged participants and resulted in the
index's decline in Tokyo, said an analyst with Nomura Securities.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May price of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose $1.10 to
$22.61 a barrel, the highest level since Jan. 17, 1986.
   ``A rise in oil prices discourages market players because they
expect it would lead to lower yen, inflation and interest rate
hikes,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``But I believe the Japanese economy has become strong enough to
remain stable against such external factors,'' the analyst added.

   Housing activists are predicting hundreds of
thousands of people will march on the nation's capital Oct. 7 to
demand more federal housing assistance for the nation's homeless.
   More than 60 organizations, including the AFL-CIO, the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, the National Organization for Women and the
National Urban League, are cooperating on the march under the
banner ``Housing Now!''
   ``This isn't a march so much as it is a calling forth of the
human spirit,'' Valerie Harper, the actress and longtime homeless
activist, said at a press conference on Wednesday. ``It's an
expression of who we are as human beings.''
   Barry Zigas, a principal organizer of the march and president of
the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, predicted that
``hundreds of thousands'' of people would participate.
   Since 1981, budget authority for all federal housing assistance
programs has been cut by more than 75 percent _ from $32 billion to
less than $8 billion a year, according to the new coalition.

   The government is mounting a prescription drug
benefit program for Medicare beneficiaries that officials say will
help guard against adverse reactions that hospitalize at least
200,000 elderly people a year.
   Richard Kusserow, inspector general for the Department of Health
and Human Services, told a House panel on Wednesday the Medicare
computer system would link the nation's pharmacies so a pharmacist
would be able to tell on the spot whether the patient is taking
another drug that could react with the new one.
   He said time is needed to establish the system, saying it would
be ``stupid'' for Congress to be so insistent on enforcing an
arbitrary deadline for setting up a computer-based billing system
that it closes off the possibility of building in the safeguards.
   Kusserow was called before the subcommittee of the Select
Committee on Aging to elaborate on a study that has found the
Medicare program paid at least $500 million in 1987 for hospital
admissions that were related to an adverse prescription drug
reaction or an overdose.

   Targeting South Korea for sanctions under
America's tough new trade law could produce a severe backlash there
and even destabilize the country's fledgling democracy, warns the
South Korean trade minister.
   Minister Han Seung-soo summarized to reporters Wednesday the
message he brought to U.S. government and congressional leaders
this week -- South Korea has been a responsive and responsible U.S.
trade partner and branding it as an unfair trader could have highly
adverse results at home.
   ``Our democracy is only about one year old and much more fragile
than the Philippines','' he said, comparing South Korea to another
U.S. ally. ``It would be advisable not to destabilize our
democratization program.''
   Under a 1988 law, the U.S. government has until the end of next
month to designate countries with persistent surpluses with America
for investigation of unfair trade practices and potential
sanctions. South Korea is a candidate for such targeting.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright and self-described former
call girl Pamella Bordes, a one-time researcher in Parliament, are
pictured together in a 1983 photograph printed today by the British
newspaper the Daily Mail.
   Wright is currently under investigation for alleged unethical
conduct. Ms. Bordes, 26, is a former Miss India whose sex and
scandal memoirs involving rich and powerful men around the world
are being serialized by the London tabloid.
   The paper reported today in the second installment of her
memoirs that the picture of her and Wright was taken in Wright's
office on Capitol Hill before he became House speaker.
   In its copyrighted story, the paper said that at the time Ms.
Bordes was working for the Indian mystic and businessman Chandra
Swami. The meeting was arranged by the Swami, who had business
connections in Washington, the paper reported.
   It continued: ``Among the things discussed, according to those
close to the Swami, was the possibility of obtaining a `green card'
permit for Pamella officially to become an American resident.
   ``Unknown to Jim Wright, this was at a time when she was, in her
own words, working as `sex bait' for the Swami's international
business deals. At the meeting, the Swami presented Mr. Wright with
some ceremonial gifts and pleaded with him to help Pamella ...
   ``His (Wright's) staff sent a copy of this picture to Pamella
signed with his best wishes. She and the Swami left the country in
a hurry after a business deal began to go legally sour.
   ``A spokesman for Mr. Wright said last night (Wednesday) that
they remembered the meeting with the Swami and his party, of which
Pamella Singh (as she was then known) was a member, but they did
not recall doing anything to help her obtain a green card.''
   Wright was cited Monday by the House ethics committee for 69
violations of House rules, including allegations he improperly
accepted nearly $145,000 in gifts and that his wife was paid
$72,000 for work she didn't do.
   He has denied charges he violated any House rules, including the
alleged use of book sales to duck a speech-fee limit.
   The Daily Mail has bought the rights to Ms. Bordes' story.
   Today's installment told how she met Chandra Swami after
arriving in New York in 1982 as the reigning Miss India.
   It said the Swami offered her a job as a public relations
executive that it described as ``a euphemism for sexual bait.''
   The first installment Wednesday contained lurid tales of sex
with financier Adnan Khashoggi, now in a Swiss prison, with a Saudi
prince and with Libyan Ahmed Gadaff Al Diam.
   The Daily Mail identified Al Diam as a cousin of Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Gadhafi, second-in-command of Libyan intelligence and
Libya's top arms buyer in Europe.
   She was quoted in Wednesday's installment as saying she got
money from Al Diam and stayed in touch with him until shortly
before she got a job last year as a researcher in the British
Parliament.
   It was that job that led to the British press's discovery of her
background and raised questions about whether national security was
compromised by allowing free movement in the House of Commons to a
woman with high-level Libyan connections.
   Ms. Bordes fled to Bali, was tracked down by British reporters,
and offered her story to the highest bidder.
   Khashoggi, 54, was arrested Tuesday in Switzerland on a U.S.
warrant charging that he helped hide assets that deposed
Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda
allegedly stole from their country.
   The tabloid said her ``sexual availability was a hard currency
used to smooth contacts between ruthless arms dealers and nations.''

<HEAD>Government: May Be Link Between Jailed Palestinians, Flight 103</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says the discovery of a
third bomb, this one hidden in a television set, by police probing
the case of two jailed Palestinians indicates they may be linked to
the downing of Flight 103.
   According to the government's Today in Parliament news service,
police found the bomb in the same apartment in the Duesseldorf
suburb of Neuss where two other explosive devices, hidden in radio
tuners, were seized last week.
   One booby-trapped tuner exploded Monday at federal police
headquarters in Wiesbaden when experts tried to disarm it, killing
Hans-Juergen Sonntag, 35, and wounding a 29-year-old colleague.
   In a followup search of the apartment, investigators found the
third bomb, Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the federal
prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe, said Wednesday.
   British investigators looking into the Dec. 21 Pan Am crash have
said the plane was blown out of the sky over Scotland by plastic
explosives hidden in a radio-cassette player.
   The imprisoned Palestinians _ Hafez Kassem Dalkamoni and Abdul
Fattah Ghandanfar _ are suspected of forming terrorist cells in
West Germany, illegal possession of weapons and two bomb attacks on
U.S. military trains, Prechtel said. The train attacks in August
1987 and April 1988 caused no injuries.
   Prechtel confirmed details of the parliamentary report, but said
again that no solid evidence has emerged to link the Palestinian
case with the disaster over Lockerbie that killed 259 people on the
plane and 11 on the ground.
   The news service informs federal officials of matters discussed
in parliamentary committees. Wednesday's report was based on
information brought to the body's internal affairs committee. No
sources were cited.
   ``There is a possible connection between the bomb found
(Thursday) and the crash of the jet over the Scottish city of
Lockerbie on Dec. 21,'' it said.
   Prechtel disputed the suggestion that the probe of the two
Palestinians, suspected of being agents of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, turned up indications
the two were involved with Lockerbie.
   ``I know about that being said, but that is nothing but
speculation,'' he said. ``They can't say it's not connected, so
they speculate that it is. But we have no evidence that it is
connected to Lockerbie _ only the theoretical possibility exists.''
   The two Palestinians were arrested in October after what police
said was the biggest seizure of illegal weapons in West Germany's
history.
   Authorities refused to describe the three bombs found last week
in detail or say whether they were armed with plastic explosives
similar to those found in the October raids.
   A radio-cassette player bomb containing the same type of
Czechoslovak-made plastic explosives as used in the Pan Am bombing
was among the weapons seized in October.
   Police arrested 14 suspects in the October raids but only
Dalkamoni and Ghandanfar remain in custody.
   Prechtel said Tuesday that authorities expect to file charges
against the two within a few months and bring them to trial this
year.

<TEXT>
   Border traffic and trade were picking
up after a sharp drop that followed the discovery of 15 mutiliated
bodies believed to be the work of a drug-smuggling cult.
   But traffic on the two Rio Grande bridges connecting Matamoros
to its Texas neighbor, Brownsville, was still less than normal on
Wednesday, officials said.
   Fear and rumors generated by the discovery of the bodies at two
nearby ranches and the arrest of five cult members still pervaded
this city of nearly 500,000.
   Reports that cult leaders had threatened to abduct and sacrifice
children if fellow members were not freed prompted parents to pick
up their children from school on Wednesday. Police said the calls
were a hoax.
   ``They (news media) are creating the psychosis with all these
rumors,'' said a telephone operator at the federal police office.
``We have hundreds of people calling to ask if the rumors are
true.''
   Jesus Urquiza Martinez, the regional police commander, said
special guards were being posted, especially at outlying schools.
   Cult leaders Alfonso de Jesus Constanzo, a Cuban-American, and
Sara Aldrete of Brownsville still were at large, and federal
investigators said the search for the missing cult members
continued and was being coordinated by the Mexico City office on
Wednesday.
   An attorney General's office spokesman in Mexico City said there
was no new information in the case on Wednesday.
   He denied an earlier report by Mexican officials in Matamoros
that Aldrete's purse, her passport and $15,000 had been found at a
Mexico City apartment and that she was feared dead.
   Juan Benitez Ayala, commander of the Federal Judicial Police in
Matamoros, said earlier this week that some officials feared
Constanzo may have ordered Aldrete's death.
   The discovery last week of the first of the 15 bodies, many of
them mutilated, sent waves of horror through this border community.
   ``We cannot hide reality,'' Chamber of Commerce Director Andres
Cahuigh said. ``This happened here, but it could have happened
anywhere. We must now start showing again the good things about
Matamoros and we must remind our visitors that this is a good city,
quiet, with a healthy society.''
   Officials said traffic across the border dropped 80 percent in
March after the disappearance of Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old
University of Texas student abducted and killed by the cult.

<TEXT>
   An Army sergeant who was sentenced to
death for the murders of a woman and two of her children was
acquitted in a retrial and will return to his military post.
   Timothy Hennis was to report today to Fort Bragg and then
transfer to Fort Knox, Ky., where he is still assigned to the
personnel control facility. He retained his rank throughout the
trial and appeal.
   Hennis, 31, was acquitted Wednesday and jumped when the verdict
was read. He then broke into tears.
   ``I missed my wife, and I missed my daughter, especially my
daughter,'' he said, calling the last four years a nightmare.
   In May 1985, Hennis was charged with murder in the deaths of
Kathryn Eastburn, 32, her daughters Kara, 5, and Erin, 3. He also
was charged with raping Mrs. Eastburn.
   ``I personally didn't feel at any time that he was proven
guilty,'' said New Hanover County Superior Court juror Kenneth
Wells. ``For a lot of us, it was a pretty quick decision to make.''
   The jury deliberated a little more than two hours. Some jurors
remained in the courthouse to hug Hennis, his family and attorneys.
   One juror said a key to the acquittal was the prosecution's
failure to prove that Hennis was inside the Eastburn house on the
night of the slayings.
   The second trial included testimony from a new witness who said
he often took walks at night in clothing similar to what a witness
in the original trial said he saw Hennis wearing that night.
   Juror Debbie McDowell said the jury believed the original
witness was mistaken when he identified the man in the Eastburn's
driveway late one night as Hennis.
   Hennis told police when he was arrested that he had been at the
Eastburn's house earlier in the day in response to an advertisement
they had placed in the newspaper seeking a home for their dog. But
he denied he was there later that night when the killings were
believed to have taken place.
   He was convicted in 1986, but the state Supreme Court ordered a
new trial because of graphic photos of the crime scene that were
shown to jurors.
   Air Force Capt. Gary Eastburn, the victim's husband, called the
retrial a mistake and said there was no basis for the Supreme
Court's decision.
   ``I was shocked at first, surprised, disappointed,'' Eastburn
said.
   He said he planned to return to England, where he and a
surviving daughter now live.

   Kim Muzyka had a strange request for
a mechanic _ remove a boa constrictor from beneath her car's
dashboard.
   ``There's a 3{-foot-long boa constrictor under the dash and he's
hungry. He hasn't eaten in three weeks,'' Ms. Muzyka told her
mechanic.
   For two hours Tuesday afternoon, technicians worked on the car
and on the snake. Finally, the boa constrictor was freed, but he
was in a surly mood.
   ``I won't let him get next to me,'' said Brent Norris, who was
baby-sitting the boa three weeks ago when it slithered away.
   Norris went to do some shopping and left the boa inside the car
with the rear window partly open. When he returned, the snake was
gone.
   Norris and Ms. Muzyka were out driving Monday when suddenly they
discovered the snake. The couple knew better than to try to extract
the boa themselves. They knew their snake would be hungry, ``and
when he's hungry, he bites,'' she said.
   That's when they decided to leave the job up to professionals.
   Hyundai service manager Ken Hayes said: ``You know, there's no
flat rate for this kind of work. Nothing about removing snakes. I
looked it up in the manual.''

<HEAD>Stocks Fall, Dollar Edges Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index fell and the
dollar edged up against the Japanese yen today as a rise in oil
prices encouraged dollar buying and discouraged stock purchases,
traders said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 178.68 points, or 0.54
percent, closing at 33,185.15. The index had gained 42.17 points to
a record 33,363.83 close Wednesday.
   The dollar ended trading at 132.28 yen, up 0.40 yen from the
previous day's 131.88-yen finish. It opened at 132.40 yen and
ranged between 132.10 yen and 132.47 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's higher opening in Tokyo followed a
rise on overseas markets after a sharp rise in oil prices,
triggered by a North Sea gas explosion.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May price of West Texas
intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose $1.10 to
$22.61 a barrel, the highest since Jan. 17, 1986.
   After opening higher, however, the dollar gradually fell as
export companies and small trading houses sold dollars from their
overseas revenues, said an analyst with a commercial bank in Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Then a rumor about a possible Japanese interest rate hike
spread in the market and inspired yen buying,'' he said, adding
that he could not confirm the rumor.
   The analyst added that dollar buying also dropped off because of
a comment by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that the
dollar's further climb would be harmful for Japanese prices.
   At a meeting with credit bank officials today, Sumita said:
``The dollar's excessive rise can be a big roadblock for our
efforts to keep Japanese prices stable and ensure a smooth
adjustment process in major nations.''
   He predicted the dollar is ``unlikely to climb persistently''
now because economic fundamentals affecting it remain more or less
unchanged.
   On the stock market, dealers said the oil price increase largely
discouraged investors.
   The price of Tokyo Electric Power Co. stock, directly affected
by the higher oil price, dropped 40 yen and closed at 5,790 yen,
its lowest this year.
   A Nomura Securities dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said investors' biggest concern is a possible interest rate hike in
Japan.
   Higher oil prices could lead to a lower yen and inflation, and
then interest rate hikes aimed at curbing the inflation.
   ``Concerns over an interest rate hike are much greater than
concerns over political instability,'' the dealer said.
   ``The release of the Japanese consumer price index figure next
week already has been making players reluctant to make major moves
because the CPI is an important indicator of economic growth,'' he
added.
   Volume on the first section of trading was estimated at 900
million shares, down from Wednesday's 1.4 billion.

<HEAD>Stanford Committee Says Fetal Tissue Can Be Used for Medical Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors can ethically use tissue from aborted
fetuses for research and medical treatment, a committee at Stanford
University concludes.
   The guidelines, drawn up by an ethics committee at Stanford's
Medical Center, are similar to rules proposed by a federal
committee last December.
   Some experts believe it may be possible to treat a variety of
diseases by transplanting tissue taken from aborted fetuses.
   The Stanford guidelines, published in today's New England
Journal of Medicine, include:
   _Women who undergo abortions should not benefit directly from
the medical use of their fetuses. They should not be reimbursed for
their abortions.
   _Medical personnel who perform abortions also should not profit
from the use of the fetal tissue.
   _Fetal tissue should be treated with the respect given to
cadavers.
   _Fetuses should not be aborted for the specific purpose of using
their tissue.
   While noting that abortions remain ``intensely controversial,''
the report concluded that human fetal tissue can be used for
medical purposes ``subject to certain important considerations.''
   Last May, Robert Windom, assistant U.S. secretary of health and
human service, announced a moratorium on using fetuses from
elective abortions in federally funded research. In December, a
National Institutes of Health advisory committee concluded that
using fetal tissue for research is acceptable. Health and Human
Service Secretary Louis Sullivan has not yet made a decision on the
panel's report.
   In an editorial in today's New England Journal, lawyer George J.
Annas of Boston University School of Medicine and Dr. Sherman Elias
of the University of Tennessee said the reports of the Stanford and
NIH committees are consistent with each other.
   ``Together, these documents show wide agreement in the medical
community on the major issues involved in the use of fetal
tissue,'' they wrote.

   Six members of a family killed in a
winery worker's jealous rage were buried, and the service was
followed shortly by word of the alleged killer's arrest in Mexico.
   Some 50 mourners attended the private service Wednesday at
Calvary Catholic Cemetery as dozens of Sonoma County sheriff's
deputies roamed the perimeter with binoculars and radios.
   The tight security stemmed from fear that Ramon Salcido, 28,
might still be in the area. But Salcido was arrested in Mexico
later Wednesday and confessed in a television interview to killing
his wife, two daughters, his mother-in-law, two of her daughters
and one of his co-workers last week.
   Salcido, 28, told police he thought his wife had been having an
affair with the co-worker.
   At the funeral, Robert Richards and his sons, Gerald, Robert Jr.
and Louis, carried six coffins. They contained the bodies of
Richards' wife, Marian Louise, 47; his three daughters, Marie, 8,
Ruth 12, and Angela, 24, who was Salcido's wife; and granddaughters
Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1.
   ``I don't know how anyone could survive this mentally without a
belief in God,'' said Judith Kelly, a friend of the Salcido family
for 13 years who said she attended church with them. ``There's a
reason for everything, and I know the whole family and all the rest
of us feel that way.
   ``You have to accept this, but this is not going to answer the
question, `Why?''' she said. ``We don't know why.''
   The Rev. Kenneth Cabral, a retired Roman Catholic priest and
longtime friend of the Richards, recited the rosary and officiated.
   White caskets carrying the four dead children and gray caskets
containing the adults were taken one by one from a mausoleum at the
cemetery to the burial site, then lowered into the ground along
with metal crucifixes and flowers.
   Kelly said the three Richards sons attending agreed they want
the surviving Salcido child, Carmina, 3, to live with a family
member when she recovers from injuries suffered when her father
allegedly cut her throat and abandoned her at a dump with her dead
sisters, whose throats were also cut.

<HEAD>A Look At Gun Turrets</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battleship USS Massachusetts has
been out of commission since 1946, but the giant gun turret on deck
is still a testament to the power and danger involved in operating
its three guns.
   The turret, with 18-inch-thick walls, is similar to that of the
USS Iowa, where a fiery explosion Wednesday killed at least 47 crew
members.
   The Massachusetts' turret contains six levels. On the uppermost
is what is called the ``turret booth,'' which resembles a cramped
boiler room and is where the turret officer directs the firing of
the 16-inch guns.
   According to Mark Newton, a former Marine who is curator of the
USS Massachusetts, the operations leading to the firing of the guns
were compartmentalized after a number of accidents in the
ammunition-handling process.
   Beyond the turret booth are three individual gun rooms and three
``powder hoist'' rooms where the gunpowder is kept prior to firing,
said Newton, who was a guest aboard the Iowa for a week in 1987.
   After the shell is placed in the gun, a door is opened to the
gun room from the powder hoist room. The powder is then rammed in
behind the shell and what is called a breech plug is sealed to
prevent the leakage of powder gases.
   The one-ton shells can travel up to 23 miles in 70 seconds.
   Newton said there are typically four men in each gun room and
one in each powder hoist room, though the numbers can vary. There
can be as many as a dozen men in the turret booth, Newton said.
Additional crew members would be on other levels of the turret.
   The USS Massachusetts, a South Dakota class ship commissioned
two years before the Iowa, is about 200 feet shorter than the
887-foot Iowa, one of the largest battleships ever built. It is
docked permanently in Fall River, a city 50 miles south of Boston,
and is on display to the public.

   A woman was arrested after her
daughter brought a teddy bear stuffed with drug paraphernalia to
school for ``share day,'' authorities said.
   Alicia Tapia, 42, was arrested at her parole officer's office
Wednesday on a charge of misdemeanor child endangerment, said
Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Dale Toussaint.
   The 8-year-old daughter, blind since birth, brought the teddy
bear called ``Ticklebear'' to school Tuesday to show her classmates
at Castro Valley Elementary School in the east San Francisco Bay
area, near Oakland.
   The girl told teacher's aide Diane Oxford that Ticklebear used
to laugh when it was hugged, but that the battery operated voice
box inside no longer worked, according to the sheriff's report.
   In an effort to fix the voice box, Oxford unzipped the back of
the toy and found a plastic bag containing a syringe, a bottle cap
fashioned into a homemade drug ``cooker'' and residue from an
unidentified drug, said Toussaint. The aide brought the bear to the
principal, who called deputies.
   The children were taken into protective custody and Tapia was
booked in lieu of $10,000 bail. She had served a jail term in 1985
for petty theft, according to court records.

   A winery worker captured at a roadblock has
confessed to killing seven people in California, including his wife
and two of his daughters, in what Mexican police said was a frenzy
of jealousy over her.
   Authorities prepared for extradition proceedings they said could
take months because the suspect, Ramon Salcido Bojorquez, is a
Mexican citizen.
   ``I'm guilty,'' the 28-year-old Salcido said in a television
interview with the private Televisa network Wednesday night in
Mazatlan. ``I did the killings in the United States and I expect to
be judged there.
   ``I came to Mexico to see my parents for the last time,'' he
said in the interview. He refused to discuss his motives for the
crimes, but said, ``I came to Mexico to see my parents for the last
time.''
   Salcido was arrested off a bus before dawn Wednesday at a
roadblock set up by anti-drug agents outside the northwestern
village of Guasave, officials said. The village is near Salcido's
hometown of Los Mochis.
   The attorney general's office said in a news release that
Salcido told Mexican police he killed ``motivated by jealousy,
after he suspected that his wife was linked to (co-worker) Tracy
Toovey.''
   Salcido is suspected of killing his wife, Toovey, two of his
daughters, his mother-in-law and two young sisters-in-law in a
rampage in Sonoma County, Calif. last weekend.
   He has been charged with four of the killings and was being
sought on a federal warrant for flight to avoid prosecution.
Salcido was a forklift operator who worked with Toovey at the Grand
Cru Vineyards.
   Fernando Arias, spokesman for the attorney general's office,
said police would escort Salcido to Mexico City on a Mexicana
flight due to arrive at 3:15 p.m. today (5:15 p.m. EDT).
   In the Mexican capital, Salcido was to undergo more questioning
as well as extradition proceedings. Officials said he had crossed
the U.S. border at Calexico.
   The attorney general's office said Salcido told police under
questioning he had lived in California for nine years and acquired
American citizenship.
   But U.S. authorities say Salcido apparently never applied for
U.S. naturalization papers and remains a Mexican citizen, meaning
the extradition process could take months. Arias said the process
could be completed in as little as a day or so.
   Salcido could face the death penalty under California law.
Mexico has no capital punishment.
   He was arrested the same day services were held in Petaluma,
Calif., for the six members of Salcido's family who were killed.
   Salcido's wife, mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law, and Toovey
were butchered and shot to death Friday. The next day, three of
Salcido's daughters were found with their throats cut, two of them
dead.
   The only survivor, 2-year-old Carmina, is recovering in Petaluma
Valley Hospital. She told investigators her father cut her and her
sisters.
   Salcido's friends told the San Francisco Examiner that he had a
frenzied, cocaine-fueled night of drinking and dancing before the
killings.
   The friends said the binge began the night of April 12, a day
after Salcido had been served with Fresno County, Calif., court
papers ordering him to pay $511 a month support for a 4{-year-old
daughter from another marriage, plus nearly $6,000 to the county
for back payments.
   In San Francisco, affidavits filed against Salcido in U.S.
District Court this week disclosed he left a note asking God's
mercy and blaming the law for the slayings, apparently referring to
the court order in the child-support case.
   Under a 1973 treaty, Mexico is obliged to honor any U.S.
extradition request, but the procedure is cumbersome and can take
months.
   A U.S. court has to request the extradition, detailing the
evidence, through the Department of Justice and the State
Department, which in turn petitions the Mexican Department of
Foreign Affairs.
   The department has to approve it, then turn it over to the
Mexican attorney general's office, which also has to approve it.
The petition then goes to the federal judge holding the suspect,
who next issues a warrant ordering the suspect to be surrendered to
U.S. authorities.

   The dollar held steady in light European trading
today as the market apparently lacked interest in pushing the U.S.
currency in either direction. Gold prices rose in Europe.
   Dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range and trading
was light and lethargic.
   ``It is very quiet and very boring, and it has been for a few
days now,'' said a trader in Milan. He said the narrowing of an
interest rate differential between the German mark and the dollar
had largely removed any incentive to rally the dollar.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7105 today, cheaper for
buyers than late Wednesday's $1.7113.
   Other rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Wednesday's
late rates:
   _1.8603 West German marks, down from 1.8615
   _1.6305 Swiss francs, down from 1.6360
   _6.2965 French francs, down from 6.3025

   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 132.28 Japanese yen, up
from 131.88. In London, the dollar traded at 132.15 yen.
   In London, gold bullion opened at a bid $383.25 a troy ounce,
down from $383.95 late Wednesday. At midmorning, London's gold
dealers fixed a recommended price of $383.90.
   Zurich gold was quoted at a bid price of $383.60 a troy ounce,
higher than late Wednesday's $383.50.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $385.45, up from $384.25.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.78 a troy

<HEAD>Farmers Union Re-Legalized Three Days After Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judicial panel declared the independent
farmers union Rural Solidarity legal today, three days after
re-legalizing the Solidarity independent trade union movement.
   The reinstated private farmers' movement can now organize
nationwide and negotiate with government or state enterprises in
this nominally socialist country where 75 percent of the arable
land is privately owned.
   In a perfunctory hearing in a Warsaw provincial court, Judge
Danuta Widawska, head of a three-judge panel, said Rural
Solidarity's registration application met the conditions of a law
passed by parliament two weeks ago that granted farmers the right
to unionize.
   Jozef Slisz, leader of the union that he expects to grow to
about 500,000 members, was among the handful of union officials
present at the sparsely attended hearing.
   ``I am pleased. After all, eight years of illegal work resulted
in this happy day. We never doubted that this work would lead to
the moment, fulfilled here now, when our union would be
registered.''
   Rural Solidarity is separate from but allied with the workers'
Solidarity movement led by Lech Walesa. Like Solidarity, it existed
legally for more than a year but was banned after the Dec. 13,
1981, martial-law crackdown.
   The Solidarity-led opposition argued during two months of talks
with authorities that the farmers union should be permitted.
   The series of accords reached April 5 included a specific
provision that Rural Solidarity would be legalized.
   Slisz said his union has been promised by government officials
an office in Warsaw, and hopes to receive it by next week.
   The Rural Solidarity leader said that in all probability he will
be a Solidarity-endorsed candidate for senator from his home
province in rural southeast Poland.
   The senate, which is to be another result of the round-table
talks, is to be the first freely elected legislative body in the
Soviet bloc. The elections are scheduled for June.
   The farmers union plans to fight for lower taxes for farmers,
higher minimum state prices for their produce and improvements in
the countryside, where many villages still lack basic elements of
modern life like running water, paved roads and telephones.
   Authorities agreed at the talks to introduce a total free market
in buying farm produce, but it is to be phased in over time so as
not to be too shocking to consumers _ who already complain of high
food prices.
   Many private farmers have been cutting back deliveries to state
procurers, charging their prices are too low to be profitable, and
have been selling directly to consumers themselves at higher prices
or simply cutting back production. Private farms produce 80 percent
of Poland's food.

   President Bush is facing increasing
congressional criticism over his handling of the Alaska oil spill
and a public opinion poll shows a sharp drop in the president's
rating on environmental issues.
   A hearing before the Senate environmental protection
subcommittee Wednesday was marked by repeated questioning of
administration witnesses on why the federal government did not move
more quickly to control the spill and limit its spread along
Alaska's southern coast.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine suggested Bush
was ``far too slow to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster''
and said federal laws should be changed to require that the federal
government assume control of such a spill immediately unless it is
clear the cleanup is going properly in private hands.
   Because of the ``unbelievably slow'' response by not only
industry, but also the Bush administration ``there has never been a
time when this situation was under control,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., chairman of the environmental subcommittee.
   Several Republican senators, though not critical of Bush
personally, said they had little confidence in leaving the cleanup
to Exxon Corp. and that the administration should have moved more
quickly to deal with the spreading oil in Alaska's Prince William
Sound.
   ``I'm disappointed the president didn't see it that way,'' said
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, adding that the oil spill on March 24
is likely to have an impact on the wildlife, ecology and economy of
southern Alaska for years to come.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who has been the
president's point man in the spill recovery, acknowledged
disappointment in Exxon's performance and said of the industry's
contingency plan for such an accident: ``On the scale of one to 10,
it was a zero.''
   But he defended the administration's decision to leave the
cleanup chore largely with the oil company. Exxon ``had made a
total (financial) commitment .. and they had the technical
expertise to deal with the problem that was already out of the
bottle,'' Skinner told the senators.
   William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
said members of the federal emergency response team were mapping
recovery strategy within hours after the spill, but along with
Exxon had decided early on that the greatest priority in the days
immediately after the accident was not containing oil already in
the water, but keeping additional oil from escaping the tanker
which at times appeared in danger of sinking.
   Meanwhile, a coalition of environmental groups today released a
poll indicating that the spill has affected how Bush is perceived
in dealing with environmental issues.
   The telephone survey conducted by Lou Harris &amp; Associates shows
a 21 percent drop in the number of people who believe Bush is doing
a good job in handling environmental matters, according to Debra
Callahan, executive director of Americans for the Environment.
   According to the survey, 60 percent of the respondents gave Bush
a positive rating in handling the environment and 32 percent a
negative rating when surveyed in February. In the March survey
shortly after the Alaska spill, Bush's positive rating dropped to
39 percent and the negative rating jumped to 49 percent, according
to the polling company.
   The poll was based on telephone interviews with 1,250 people
nationwide between March 26 and March 30, Ms. Callahan said.
Samples of this size normally have margins of error of about three
percentage points either way.
   The results of the survey were made public by the Americans for
the Environment, the National Wildlife Federation and the Sierra
Club as part of a study of public attitudes _ as reflected by
opinion polls _ on environmental issues over the last two decades.
   On April 7, Bush directed greater federal involvement in the
cleanup effort, committing military assistance to the recovery and
putting Adm. Paul Yost, the U.S. Coast Guard commandant, in charge
of coordination in Alaska.
   Bush himself suggested in a speech last week to the American
Society of Newspaper Editors that he might have responded too
slowly in directing increased federal involvement in the cleanup,
saying he perhaps ``should accept some criticism'' on that count.
   ``If there's a lesson here that one agency or another might have
moved faster, I will be the first to learn from that,'' said the
president.

<HEAD>Defense Analyst Sentenced For Supplying Information to South Africa</HEAD>

   A man who admitted giving more than 200
documents to the South African government has been sentenced to 10
years in a federal prison and fined $5,000.
   ``Communicating vital classified information to agents of a
foreign power is despicable,'' U.S. District Court Judge Herbert F.
Murray told Joseph Dolce of Havre de Grace as he imposed the
maximum sentence Wednesday.
   Dolce, a former weapons analyst at Aberdeen Proving Ground,
pleaded guilty Oct. 11 to one count of espionage as part of a plea
bargain with federal prosecutors.
   ``I have failed my country, my family and myself,'' Dolce said.
``I can only hope that with time I can demonstrate to my children
that their father is an honorable man.''
   The 215 pieces of information the civilian analyst relayed from
1979 to 1983 were only moderately damaging or of little threat to
national security, assistant U.S. attorney Gary Jordan said. Dolce,
49, terminated his relationship with the South Africans in 1983,
apparently because of a personality clash with a new defense
attache.
   Jordan said Dolce provided South Africans with classified
information about U.S. and Soviet conventional weapons systems,
``their capabilities and their frailties.''
   Harold I. Glaser, Dolce's attorney, said the civilian analyst
did not intend to harm the United States but saw himself as helping
the United States by aiding an ally. Dolce said he did not get any
money for the information, which he passed on at the South African
Embassy in Washington and at missions in London and Los Angeles.
   Dolce was intent on assisting South Africa its war in Angola
against Soviet-backed Cuban and Marxist Angolan troops, Glaser said.
   Dolce resigned Sept. 30 from his $34,000-a-year job as a
research analyst for the Army Material Systems Analyst Activity, an
agency that evaluates weapons systems. He had a midlevel security
clearance.

   Flowers and get-well wishes from fans around
the world deluged the hospital where Lucille Ball was in critical
condition today recuperating from emergency heart surgery.
   Miss Ball's husband, Gary Morton, said the TV actress was ``in
great spirits.''
   Doctors replaced the 77-year-old comedian's main heart artery,
or aorta, and aortic valve Tuesday with organ tissue taken from the
body of an unidentified 27-year-old man. Her condition was listed
as critical, primarily because of the seriousness of the surgery,
said Ron Wise, spokesman at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   ``She continues to show steady progress,'' Wise said late
Wednesday. Doctors were optimistic Miss Ball would make a full
recovery, he added.
   The hospital received hundreds of messages and inquiries from
fans and the media worldwide, Wise said.
   ``Before it's over the hospital will look like a combination of
the U.S. post office and the botanical gardens,'' he said.
   One fan donated blood in Miss Ball's name. Another brought
poetry. Celebrity well-wishers who called her husband included pop
singer Michael Jackson, actress Eva Gabor and publisher Malcolm
Forbes.
   ``We laughed a lot and had some fun,'' Morton said after
visiting his wife Wednesday. ``She's just in great spirits _ a
little pain, but she's doing nicely, thank you.''
   Morton said Miss Ball wanted to know ``How's the dog?'' and told
him to ``Go home, go home, go home.''
   Fans tacked dozens of cards to the door of the couple's Beverly
Hills home, Morton said.
   Miss Ball married Morton, who has been her executive producer,
in 1961.
   The redheaded entertainer is best known for the zany character
she portrayed opposite her late ex-husband, Desi Arnaz, in the ``I
Love Lucy Show.'' The program, one of the most popular in
television history, aired from 1951 to 1957 and is still seen
throughout the world in reruns.

<TEXT>
   The USS Iowa, a World War II hulk of a
battleship with wooden decks and the rare added amenity of a
bathtub, has been struck only once by enemy fire despite two wars
and patrol duty last year off the Persian Gulf.
   With nine 16-guns that can hurl shells as heavy as a small car a
distance of 23 miles, the Iowa is at once threatening and majestic.
Only it and the three other ships in its class have cannon that
large.
   Consigned to mothballs for 24 years after the Korean War, the
Iowa and three sister battleships were refitted for modern warfare
during Reagan's military buildup in the early 1980s.
   In addition to cannon, the Iowa, the Wisconsin, the Missouri and
the New Jersey bear 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of carrying
nuclear warheads 1,000 miles, four 20mm guns able to shoot 100
rounds in less than a second at anti-ship missiles, and 16 Harpoon
missiles that can hit ships up to 60 miles away.
   Supporters of the recommissioning said the cost of refitting
each battleship, about $400 million, was the same as building a new
frigate, a ship with far less firepower. The Iowa cost $114 million
to build.
   When it was launched in 1942, then-Secretary of the Navy Frank
Knox called the Iowa ``the greatest ship ever launched by the
American nation.''
   Protected by 17{-inch thick armor, the dark gray ship has a top
speed of 30 knots. Iowa class battleships were the largest built by
the United States, surpassed in size only by two Japanese
battleships, the Yamato and Musashi. Most of its 887-foot length is
decked in well-scrubbed wood.
   During World War II, the heyday of ships of its size, the Iowa
fought in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   The battleship carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt to
Morocco on the first leg of his journey to Tehran in 1943 to meet
with Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin to discuss the war against
Germany.
   A bathtub installed on the Iowa for that voyage remains aboard
to this day, making it the only ship in the Navy with such a regal
convenience.
   The Iowa was in the heat of the action during the Pacific
campaign, fighting in decisive battles off the South Sea islands of
Tinian, Okinawa and Formosa.
   The battleship was struck by enemy fire for the first and only
time during that Pacific campaign, hit by two Japanese shells while
it was supporting air strikes against Kwajalein and Enewetak Atolls
in the Marshall Islands.
   The damage was slight, however, and the Iowa was anchored in
Tokyo Harbor as U.S. occupation forces went ashore at the end of
World War II in 1945.
   The battleship was retired from service in 1949, then brought
back for duty in the Korean War. During that conflict, the Iowa
fired more than 4,500 rounds from the 16-inch guns, exceeding the
amount fired from ships in that class during World War II.
   The Iowa returned to mothballs in 1958, and spent the next 24
years in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. By the time the Iowa was
recommissioned in 1982, it had been in active service for only 12
of its 40 years.
   Modernization made it possible to operate with a smaller crew,
60 officers and 1,500 enlisted men, compared with the 117 officers
and 1,804 enlisted men aboard during World War II.

   A jury has recommended that a former
librarian be sent to the electric chair for killing six people and
trying to kill 24 others in a 1987 shopping-center death spree.
   A videotape showing a composed and articulate William Cruse, 61,
hours after the rampage was the prosecutors' best weapon, jurors
said.
   ``We all felt the same _ he knew what he was doing,'' juror
Edward Cook said Wednesday after the Polk County panel brought in
the death penalty recommendation for the murders of two young
college students, a 67-year-old grandmother, an engineer and two
police officers.
   The same jury rejected an insanity plea and convicted Cruse on
April 5 of 32 counts of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping in
the April 23, 1987, melee at two shopping centers in Palm Bay,
about 30 miles south of Cape Canaveral on Florida's east coast.
   ``Cruse declared war on the community of Palm Bay,'' said State
Attorney Norm Wolfinger. ``The jury verdicts were very appropriate.
... Without that tape, the jury would have had to guess. They saw
the real Cruse on that tape.''
   ``It was the tape,'' said jury foreman Wayne Hogan. ``The tape
had a lot to do with it.''
   Circuit Judge John Antoon set sentencing for July 28, when he
can sentence Cruse either to death or to life in prison with the
possibility of parole in 25 years.
   The videotape shown during the five-week trial showed an
apparently relaxed Cruse answering questions about the shootings.
   He expressed surprise that he had shot anyone but said he was
``trying to get back'' at people who taunted him and thought he was
a homosexual. He said he was ``drunk and crazy.''

   Two police officer who put invisible dye
in restrooms in the city-county building and the mayor's office
have been suspended without pay for their April Fools' Day prank.
   ``I had a brand new white shirt on and it's ruined,'' said City
Administrator Brad Hancock. ``The joke was done in extremely poor
taste.''
   The colorless powder dye is used by police to catch criminals
and is normally put on money. It turns a dark purple when it comes
into contact with skin. The dye is harmless but takes a while to
wear off.
   It was put on toilets and toilet paper in the city-county
building's restroom and Mayor Lawrence Yack's office in this
eastern Utah city of 3,800.
   ``One (city worker) went into the restroom to blow his nose and
blew the dye all down his shirt, his pants and his shoes,'' said
Hancock. ``He thought it was toxic or something and didn't know if
he was going to die or what.''
   Officer Kim Olsen was suspended without pay for three days and
Officer Steve Hooley for two days, Hancock said Wednesday. Olsen
was given the additional day off because he had been formally
warned once before following another prank, said Hancock.
   The two policemen are appealing the suspension.
   The mayor's shirt and tie were ruined when he rubbed dye from
his desk onto his clothes. Some of the mayor's important paperwork
was also damaged and had to be redone, said Hancock.

   Explosions such as the one in a gun turret
aboard the battleship USS Iowa near Puerto Rico on Wednesday are
rare but deadly.
   Based on information drawn from Navy archives and public
records, these were among the major explosions, fires, collisions
and similar Navy disasters in this century:
   _April 24, 1988, the non-nuclear submarine USS Bonefish was
rocked by explosions which killed three crewmen off the coast of
Florida.

<HEAD>Iran, Iraq Resume Talks In Geneva</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq resumed
U.N.-sponsored peace talks today after a five-month hiatus, but
statements by both sides suggested prospects for an agreement were
slight.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, in response to a reporter's
question, dismissed demands Iran has made for a full withdrawal of
Iraqi troops from Iranian territory as a precondition for progress
at the talks.
   ``The Iranian side should know it has no right to dictate, to
set the priorities at the talks,'' Aziz said after he and his
Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, held separate meetings
with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who is
mediating the talks.
   ``The talks have to address the whole peace plan with all its
provisions and all its obligations,'' Aziz said.
   He was being asked about Velayati's call on Perez de Cuellar to
set a date for the Iraqi pullout and devise ways to monitor it.
   Direct talks between the two delegations were scheduled for
later today at the Geneva U.N. building.
   The negotiations are aimed at consolidating the U.N.-supervised
cease-fire that has been in effect in the Persian Gulf since August.
   Velayati made a statement Wednesday night accusing Baghdad of
``illegitimate and expansionist aims'' and renewed charges that
Iraq's refusal to withdraw was holding up implementation of a U.N.
peace plan.
   Aziz reiterated charges that Iran was bargaining in bad faith
and said ``real negotiations'' had never begun.
   The United Nations last week called for more flexibility on both
sides.
   After arriving in Geneva, the U.N. chief told reporters that
positions remain ``rather far apart.'' But he said a continuing
dialogue was important and that agreement on holding talks signaled
each side's ``interest in finding a negotiated solution'' on fully
carrying out U.N. cease-fire resolution 598.
   U.N. officials have said the talks are expected to run at least
two days.
   The ministers last held direct negotiations in November.
   Peace talks began Aug. 25, five days after a cease-fire took
effect after eight years of fighting in the gulf war. They soon
stalemated over Iranian demands that Iraqi troops withdraw to
prewar borders, and Iraq's call for dredging of its only outlet to
the Persian Gulf, the Shatt-al-Arab. The waterway is clogged by
sunken ships, ordnance and accumulated silt.
   Iran has said the operation could begin once the border issue is
resolved.
   Also unresolved is the issue of returning prisoners of war.
   Both sides have sent back only a few hundred POWs since late
last year, despite the U.N. resolution's call for immediate
repatriation.

   Residents staggered from shelters today
to face a city devoid of electricity, water and bread, but fighting
that has raged for weeks quieted down into intermittent shellfire.
   Many people opted to leave the city, but one ferry company
operating from between the Christian sector and Cyprus suspended
service because of shells crashing into the water around it.
   The city has been without power since Sunday when fuel stocks
dried up, and no ships dared risk the gantlet of shells to unload.
   The Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation radio said the French
navy ship Penhors would unload its cargo of fuel oil within 24
hours.
   One-third will be pumped off at the Moslem-run power station at
Jiyeh south of Beirut, and the rest will go to the Christian-run
power station of Zouk north of Beirut. France dispatched the ship
April 5, but shelling has kept it from coming to shore.
   Another French ship, the Rance, carried wounded Lebanese to
Cyprus for eventual treatment in Paris hospitals. The first group
of 48 arrived in France early today. More were expected in Paris
later.
   Beirut residents have been relying on small generators to run
vital appliances, but without municipal power, the water pumps that
supply the city have shuddered to a halt.
   A city official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there
was not enough fuel for garbage trucks to operate, ``in addition to
the fact that about 90 percent of our 2,000 cleaning employees have
left Beirut.''
   Flour stocks have dwindled because ships are not docking.
   With no water and flour, bakers in west Beirut sold no bread.
   The body of Spanish Ambassador Pedro Manuel de Arstegui was
flown by Lebanese army helicopter to Larnaca, Cyprus, where it was
transferred to a Spanish military transport plane for a seven-hour
flight to Madrid.
   De Aristegui, 61, was killed when a 240mm mortar round, believed
to have been fired by a Syrian gunner, struck his villa in the
Christian suburb of Hadath on Sunday.
   Police say 270 people have been killed and 975 wounded since the
latest fighting flared March 8.
   The battles started after Gen. Michel Aoun, the army commander
and head of the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's divided government,
imposed a naval blockade on illegal militia-run ports.
   Moslem militiamen retaliated by shelling Christian sections.
Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, joined the Moslems.
   The agent for the Cypriot-flagged Larnaca Rose said service
would be suspended at least two days. The Larnaca Rose and the
Cypriot-flagged Baroness M have ferried more than 15,000 Lebanese
to Cyprus since March 8.
   The Baroness M returned to Larnaca empty today. A spokesman for
I.S. Geropoulos, the shipping agency handling the Greek-owned
Baroness M, said the ferry could not take on passengers on its last
trip to Lebanon because one of two speedboats being used to shuttle
people from land was destroyed by a rocket Wednesday. The other had
engine problems, he said.
   Artillery fire has kept Beirut International Aiport, the
country's only air transport facility, closed for six weeks.

<HEAD>Sony Announces First Portable Digital Video Tape Recorder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. today announced it has developed a
portable digital videocassette recorder that allows tapes to be
copied or edited more than 20 times with little loss in quality.
   The machine, dubbed the DVR-1, is the first portable VCR that
uses digital rather than analog recording, resulting in better
picture quality and little picture distortion when copies are made,
Sony officials said.
   In digital recording, video and audio information is converted
into a series of binary pulses such as those used by computers to
process information. Compact discs also use digital recording to
improve sound quality.
   Although the machine is intended primarily for professionals,
such as television journalists, company officials said they plan
eventually to develop one for the general public.
   The recorder will go on sale in January for a list price of
$37,000, Sony said. It weighs 24 pounds, is battery-powered and can
record up to 94 minutes on a single cassette tape.
   ``We definitely plan to produce a consumer model and bring the
price down eventually to about $760,'' said a Sony official who
requested anonymity.
   Sony has been selling a non-portable digital videotape recorder
for studio use since July for about $87,000.
   When conventional analog videotapes are copied and recopied,
such as during editing at TV stations, picture quality begins to
decline after several copies, or ``generations.'' Sony said tapes
recorded on the DVR-1 can go through more than 20 generations with
little quality loss.
   If Sony's digital videotape format becomes widely accepted it
could also reduce present problems of convertibility between the
world's many television systems because of the greater ease in
processing digitally recorded information.

<HEAD>Senate Confirms Georgian As Peace Corps Director</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has confirmed President Bush's
nomination of Georgia state Sen. Paul Coverdell to head the Peace
Corps.
   The Senate acted on a voice vote late Wednesday, one day after
the Foreign Relations Committee had recommended approval of
Coverdell, who was the Republican leader of the Georgia Senate.
   Coverdell, 50, is a former chairman of the Georgia Republican
Party and an active supporter of President Bush since 1979. He was
chairman of Bush's Georgia campaign committee during his
unsuccessful 1980 presidential race and chairman of his Southern
steering committee during the 1988 campaign.
   Coverdell, owner of an insurance business in Atlanta, succeeds
Loret Miller Ruppe, who has been director of the Peace Corps since
1981, the longest tenure of any director since the agency was
founded in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy.
   Coverdell told the Foreign Relations Committee last week that he
supports the congressional mandate for an increase in the number of
Peace Corps volunteers to 10,000, from the current level of 7,000.
   He said he also wants to increase the number of minority
volunteers in the corps, which now is 93 percent white, and to
expand the Peace Corps' domestic role of promoting a better
understanding by Americans of people from other countries.

<HEAD>Pope Meets Walesa, Prays For Success of Political Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today embraced fellow Pole
Lech Walesa and told the Solidarity leader he is praying for the
success of the new political reforms in their homeland.
   ``My batteries are recharged, and now I am ready to lift any
weight,'' Walesa said after a 30-minute private audience.
   The charismatic Polish labor leader, who said he had come to
seek the pope's blessing for the changes in Poland, briefed the
pope on the recent accords with the communist government restoring
the legality of the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union
after nearly eight years of repression.
   Earlier today, Walesa visited the hospital where the pope was
treated after being shot by a Turkish gunman in 1981 and said:
``Here the life of Solidarity was saved because here the life of a
great Pole, the holy father, was saved.''
   Walesa received the pope's warm endorsement of Solidarity during
a visit to the Vatican in January 1981. During today's audience,
Walesa said Solidarity had its roots in the social doctrine of the
Roman Catholic Church, according to a brief account of the meeting
by Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   The church is a major force in Poland, and church
representatives participated in the negotiations that produced the
reforms.
   Navarro quoted the pope as saying he prays that ``the country
has a new possibility and that the transformations in the social,
political and economic life of the entire society can take place.''
   When Walesa arrived at the pope's private library, he knelt at
John Paul's feet. The pope pulled him up and embraced him, saying:
``We have to show how you greet the pope and how I greet you.''
   ``I greet you with all my heart,'' Walesa said.
   The half-hour audience was considered long by Vatican standards,
especially since no time was taken up by translation between the
two countrymen.
   After the private discussions, the two men were joined in the
library by Walesa's wife, Danuta, and five Solidarity aides and the
bishop of Gdansk, where the shipyard technician lives.
   It was the fourth meeting between the pope and Walesa. They also
met during pilgrimages by the pope to his homeland in 1983, the
year Walesa won the Nobel Peace Prize, and again in 1987.
   When the pope presented Walesa with a mosiac of the Madonna, he
said: ``This is a remembrance for Lech Walesa and for Solidarity
which has been reborn.'' Walesa gave the pope an album entitled
``The Birth of Solidarity.''
   Walesa, invited to Rome by Italy's trade union leaders, has said
he would seek Western help for Poland's economic crisis. He will
meet with top Italian officials on Friday.
   During his visit to the Gemelli Hospital, he blamed the
communist government for Poland's ``economic disaster'' but said he
is ready to work with the government to overcome the difficulties.

   Richard C. Dobbins Jr. came to court as
a potential juror and left in handcuffs for jail after he yelled
``Guilty!'' and forced court officials to send other potential
jurors home.
   Superior Judge Maxwell J. Heiman found the Watertown resident in
contempt, sentenced him to 10 days in jail and fined him $100 for
causing 66 others in the jury pool to be disqualified from the
triple-murder trial of Donald Couture.
   When the court clerk called the roll Wednesday, each potential
juror answered ``Here,'' except Dobbins. After Dobbins yelled,
``Guilty!'' instead, the stunned judge ordered sheriff's deputies
to handcuff and remove him, then disqualified the rest of the
prospective jurors and apologized to the defendant.
   Couture is charged with the murder of three guards during a $2
million robbery of Purolator Security Inc. in 1979.
   Couture and co-defendant Lawrence Pelletier of Waterbury were
convicted on the charges in a 1982 trial, but the convictions were
overturned because a judge found that a prosecutor's had acted
improperly.

   Police broke up a pro-democracy rally outside
Communist Party headquarters today, hitting and kicking protesters
slow to disperse. The government vowed tough action to stop a wave
of student-led protests.
   Later, about 1,500 university students braved heavy rain and
gathered for a fourth day in Tiananmen Square, the symbolic
political center of China, which is near party headquarters.
   On the march to the square, one group carried a wreath and a
portrait of Hu Yaobang, the reform-minded Communist Party chief
whose death Saturday has served as the rallying point for the
demonstrations. Two police cars followed close behind.
   Protesters have demanded the party reassess Hu and honor him for
making contributions to reform.
   ``We are the civilized revolutionaries of society. The blood of
our classmates will not be shed in vain!'' student leaders shouted.
More than 1,000 onlookers gathered around.
   Because of the rain, turnout was much lower than for previous
days' activities.
   Marches also were reported in Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Hefei,
and Nanjing. The unrest, which began Monday, is the largest and
most widespread student unrest since marches in the winter of
1986-87.
   Hu was ousted in 1987 on charges of being too soft on students
who led those demonstrations.
   Beijing municipal authorities issued a statement today
expressing support for activities to mourn Hu, but they condemned
the protests and said demonstrators will be ``dealt with severely
according to the law.''
   The nationally televised evening news issued a similar warning,
the first acknowledgement to the nation of the unrest. The lengthy
and unusual television statement was a clear indication China's
leaders regard the protests as a serious threat.
   Today's student speakers said they were demanding that
officially controlled student unions be disbanded and replaced with
democratic organizations.
   They also repeated chants of earlier days denouncing
dictatorship and corruption and demanding free speech, free press,
more money for education and disclosure by officials of their
incomes and bank accounts.
   The pre-dawn clash outside Communist Party headquarters today
came as thousands of students massed outside the Zhongnanhai
compound, where China's leaders work and have homes. The protesters
demanded to see the officials.
   ``Fascists, dogs!'' the demonstrators shouted as police rushed
the crowd of about 3,000. ``Hoodlums and bandits!''
   The official Xinhua News Agency said four officers were hurt by
flying bottles and bricks. Students claimed plainclothes police
hurled the objects.
   Students claimed police beat about 200 people and that 30 were
injured. Reporters saw a few dozen beatings.
   The students said more than 40 students were in police custody,
including four or five leaders. There were no official reports of
arrests.
   One student from the China University of Politics and Law was
injured by police. Students this morning hung his bloody clothes
outside a building on the campus. His condition was not known.
   All afternoon Wednesday, protesters rallied in Tiananmen Square
and were watched and sometimes cheered by a crowd that grew to
about 20,000 people.
   Police presence around the square today was light, with groups
of fewer than a dozen scattered around the square and at nearby
intersections.
   Most students left after several hours, leaving about 200 in the
square still holding political discussions in small groups, writing
essays and poems on democracy and reading them to the crowd.
   In Nanjing, about 1,000 students set out today from Nanjing
University toward the Jiangsu provincial government offices, said
an American teacher at the school, who spoke by telephone on
condition of anonymity.
   It was not clear if they reached the offices. The teacher said a
similar number of students marched Wednesday night through city
streets for about four hours, carrying banners and chanting, ``Down
with bureaucracy! Down with autocracy! Down with dictatorship!''

   The armed forces fairly treat allegations
of homosexuality against female members, says the chairman of a
civilian advisory group, despite testimony that claims of
lesbianism are being used to harass women.
   ``Being charged with anything is not harassment,'' Connie Lee,
head of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services,
said Wednesday after a day of testimony from present and former
servicewomen, some who said they were homosexual.
   ``If someone is charged with this, they have the opportunity, as
any person does in any court of law when they are accused of
something, of saying, I am or I am not,'' Lee said at the spring
meeting of the committee.
   Lee would not predict what, if anything, the committee would
recommend to the defense secretary as a result of the hearing,
although she said the committee opposes harassment in any form. The
committee, composed of 33 appointed civilians, advises the
secretary on the recruitment and retention of servicewomen.
   Four witnesses, two of whom were discharged from the service for
admitting their lesbianism and two of whom are fighting allegations
of homosexuality, asked the committee Wednesday to tackle the use
of such allegations for sexual harassment.
   ``It is time to call attention to institutionalized sexual
harassment in the form of witchhunts that are out of control,''
said Mary Elizabeth Harrison, a first class personnelman in the
Navy. ``An underlying, dangerously tolerant attitude exists
throughout the military structure which places women at a
significant disadvantage in the armed forces in all aspects, from
advancement to morale to retention.''
   Harrison had been assigned to the USS Grapple, a salvage ship
based in Little Creek, Va., when a male crewman last year accused
her and another woman sailor of being homosexual. Harrison said she
wanted to file a grievance but ``I was told that the commanding
officer did not want an investigation on his ship because of how it
might appear,'' so she declined to file.
   Months later, Harrison said, she was summoned before the Naval
Investigative Service and told she and several other woman sailors
were under investigation for alleged homosexuality.
   ``We were told various lies _ that we would be protected if we
turned the others in, that the others had already confessed, that
they had conclusive evidence of our guilt,'' she said.
   In the five months since, Harrison said she has been reassigned
to shore duty, received bad evaluations, had her car vandalized in
the barracks parking lot and ``become the gossip of the
waterfront.''
   ``I am beginning to understand how women simply become exhausted
fighting a no-win battle and admit anything in order to leave the
abuse and humiliation of the military behind,'' she added.
   Darlene Chamberlin, a former airman first class in the U.S. Air
Force who was discharged for admitting her homosexuality to an
investigations panel, said some servicewomen ``are accused of
lesbianism because they refuse advances from male personnel, or are
strong and athletic, or for choosing to socialize with other
females.''
   According to the Defense Department, from 1985 to 1987, women
were three times as likely as men to be discharged for
homosexuality. Five of every 10,000 men and 16 of every 10,000
women on active duty were discharged annually for suspected
homosexuality, DOD found.
   Some witnesses touched on the situation at the Marine boot camp
in Parris Island, S.C., where three women were jailed and more than
a dozen were forced out of the service last year after being
charged with homosexuality.

<HEAD>Nurse's Aide Now Says She Only Killed 22 Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nurse's aide who had told police she
killed at least 39 elderly hospital patients now says she killed
22, a police investigator said today.
   Max Edelbacher told The Associated Press that Waltraud Wagner, a
30-year-old nurse's aide at Vienna's Lainz hospital, last week
withdrew her earlier confession of 39 killings.
   State prosecutors refused then to give details. But Edelbacher
said Ms. Wagner now had identified by name 11 people she killed.
She said she killed 11 more whose names she could not provide, he
said.
   Police showed Ms. Wagner photographs of possible victims today
to try to jog her memory, Edelbacher said.
   Ms. Wagner was arrested April 7 along with two other nurse's
aides, Irene Leidolf, 27, and Maria Gruber, 26. A fourth aide,
Stefanie Mayer, 49, was detained two days later.
   Police said then that the four women had admitted to killing at
least 49 patients at Lainz since 1982. They said they doubted the
motive was mercy killing because the victims had water forced into
their lungs or died from lethal doses of medicine.
   In questioning today, Ms. Leidolf stuck to her confession of
killing three patients, Edelbacher said.
   Edelbacher said Ms. Gruber and Ms. Mayer would be interrogated
Friday, along with Dr. Franz Pesendorfer, the suspended head of the
hospital department where the nurse's aides worked.
   None of the women has been charged, but all are in custody.
   The killings have prompted a nationwide debate about the
standard of health care, particularly in Vienna's overtaxed
hospitals.
   Alois Stacher, the doctor in charge of the capital's health
department, today announced eight ``emergency measures'' to try to
relieve the overworked doctors, nurses and other personnel at
Vienna's hospitals.
   They included an undefined reorganization of hospital
management, measures to move convalescing patients out of needed
hospital beds, and new teamwork among doctors, nurses and aides in
hospital wards.
   Stacher also mandated a new one-year ``trial period'' for
doctors of Pesendorfer's rank who head departments, and new
regulations laying down exact working hours for them.
   Several such senior doctors maintain private practices outside
the hospitals where they work.
   Pesendorfer has been severely criticized in Austrian media for
failing to tell police investigating rumors of mass killings at his
department a year ago the name of the doctor who had heard the
speculation.
   There also has been widespread criticism of the violation of
regulations barring aides from administering injections to patients.
   Under Austrian law, doctors are only allowed to hand that task
to qualified nurses if absolutely necessary.

<HEAD>Vermont Newspaper Votes To Unionize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees at The Burlington Free Press,
Vermont's largest daily newspaper, have voted overwhelmingly to
unionize, results tallied today show.
   The vote was 77-47 to join the Graphic Communications
International Union.
   The election pitted the 150,000-member union against the $3.3
billion Gannett Co., which historically has fought hard against
unions at its 88 newspapers. It was the first time in five years
that Gannett has lost a union election.
   The Free Press will be the only unionized newspaper in the state.
   Publisher Donna Donovan said, ``Burlington Free Press employees
have chosen to be represented by a union and we fully respect their
choice.''
   ``We are elated,'' said copy editor Paul Beique, a union
supporter. ``Now we can begin preparing to negotiate a contract.''
   Workers at the Free Press had complained of low wages, unpaid
overtime, and recent reductions in health benefits. They alleged
Gannett has taken profits from the Free Press and other newspapers
to support other enterprises, notably USA Today, its nationally
circulated newspaper.
   Donovan countered that salaries have improved during her three
years at the paper, that she has added new staff to the newsroom
recently, and that workers would lose more than they would gain by
joining a union.
   About 140 employees were eligible to vote in the election.
Fourteen votes were challenged, either by the company, the union or
the National Labor Relations Board and are not contained in the
124-vote total.
   The next step for the union is to hold elections in the various
departments to name representatives to the union's negotiating
committee.
   Unions represent about 20 percent of the 37,000 Gannett Co.
workers.
   The Free Press has a daily circulation of 55,000 and a Sunday
circulation of 60,000. Gannett bought the 162-year-old paper in
1971.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for closer
ties between American and Soviet trade unions at a meeting with two
U.S. labor leaders, Pravda reported today.
   Gorbachev expressed support for American trade unionists ``who
are for a dialogue, for the development of relations between the
Soviet and American trade unions,'' the Communist Party daily said.
   ``It is strange and incomprehensible when a dialogue has already
been established on the governmental level but on the union level
great obstacles are still encountered,'' Gorbachev was quoted as
saying by the Soviet news agency Tass. He met Wednesday with
AFL-CIO vice-presidents William Winpisinger and Jack Sheinkman.
   As recently as October 1988, there were no official ties between
Soviet labor unions and the AFL-CIO, based on the AFL-CIO's
contention that Soviet labor organizations exist not to represent
the interests of their membership but as government-controlled
organizations to keep workers in line.
   The Soviets say that is not true, and Gorbachev himself in 1987
called on Soviet unions to be more vigorous in defending the rank
and file.
   Gorbachev also told the labor officials that a national plan has
been worked out to convert some defense factories over to civilian
production, and several enterprises have been designated as
prototypes, Pravda said.
   The conversion is planned to follow defense spending cuts and
help fulfill Gorbachev's promises to improve consumer goods
production.
   A Leningrad shipyard that has produced naval hardware for 150
years has already begun partially retooling to produce food
processing equipment as well, Tass reported today. The yard, which
was not identified in the report, expects to have produced nearly
$35 million in non-military goods by 1991, Tass said.
   The partial conversion follows orders to Leningrad's
shipbuilding industry to produce machines for cafes, pizzerias and
snack bars, as well as equipment for sausage and dumpling making,
Tass said.

   Sotheby's auction house says it hopes its
decision to stop selling elephant tusks or ivory jewelry, furniture
or artworks less than 50 years old will help stop the slaughter of
elephants.
   The auction house announced the decision Wednesday, saying the
new policy would apply to Sotheby's 17 auction centers and 44
offices worldwide.
   ``This is very much of a corporate statement that we support the
groups that are trying to stop this slaughter and this atrocity,''
said Michael Ainslie, Sotheby's president and chief executive
officer.
   The move followed a large advertisement placed in The New York
Times by Friends of Animals, of Norwalk, Conn., decrying the
scheduled auction Friday of two African elephant tusks for an
estimated $12,000 to $16,000.
   The ad, which ran Wednesday, said nearly 1 million elephants, or
three-fourths of Africa's wild elephant population, have been wiped
out since 1979.
   The tusks in question were legally acquired before 1976, said
Ainslie.
   ``Nonetheless, we are very much aware that, laws
notwithstanding, the visibility of such a sale does have the
potential to induce more destruction,'' said Ainslie. ``The seller
has decided on our strong recommendation to remove them from the
sale.''
   Later Wednesday, Sotheby's bought the tusks from the
unidentified seller for an undisclosed sum. They will be donated
``to an appropriate institution or museum,'' said a spokeswoman,
Diana Levitt.
   ``We're thrilled,'' said Priscilla Feral, president of Friends
of Animals. ``Now, we're going to ask them to firm up the decision
by refusing to deal in any ivory regardless of the age.''
   Ainslie said Sotheby's consulted with the African Wildlife
Foundation before making its decision, which will affect a very
small portion of its profits.
   Ms. Feral said her group also would ask the competing Christie's
auction house to follow Sotheby's example.
   Christie's spokeswoman Roberta Meneker said, ``Generally
speaking, we do not intend to sell ivory. But we can't make a
categorical statement.''
   She said a distinction should be drawn between modern ivory
pieces and ``an 18th-century tusk that comes from England or
France.''

<HEAD>Lawsuit Seeks Damages for Birth Defects Linked to Liquor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who drank bourbon regularly during
pregnancy is seeking damages from a liquor company for her son's
severe birth defects in a potentially landmark federal case.
   Candace Thorp of Seattle and her husband, Harold, are suing the
James B. Beam Distillery Co. of Kentucky, claiming it should have
provided warning labels on its whiskey bottles pointing out that
alcohol can cause birth defects.
   The Thorp case is believed to be the first lawsuit involving
fetal alcohol syndrome to go to trial in the nation, the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer reported today. Seattle doctors first identified
and named the syndrome in 1973 and one of those doctors is listed
as a witness for the Thorps.
   The case is scheduled to go to trial in U.S. District Court in
Seattle, with jury selection starting Monday.
   Five-year-old Michael Thorp was born mentally retarded,
neurologically impaired, developmentally stunted, with facial and
other body malformations, according to court documents.
   Mrs. Thorp said in court documents that she drank up to a half a
fifth per day of Jim Beam bourbon during her pregnancy. She said
she didn't know her drinking would damage her child.
   Attorneys for the Beam company argue in their briefs that any
damage that may have resulted was due to Mrs. Thorp's decision to
drink while pregnant.
   The Thorps and attorneys for both sides declined to be
interviewed.
   In the lawsuit filed in November 1987, the Thorps claim the
manufacturer was negligent in not warning consumers. The liquor
company says Washington state law governing product liability does
not require manufacturers to issue warnings of risks that are
considered ``generally known'' by the community.
   In a deposition, Beam's chief executive officer, Barry M.
Berish, said that he was aware in the late 1970s of fetal alcohol
syndrome and studies linking alcohol use in pregnancy to birth
defects. Berish said he opposed putting warning labels on bottles
because it would be ineffective.
   ``The pregnant woman that is the abuser, that has the addiction,
that is the excessive drinker, you could put a skull and crossbones
on the bottle and she will continue to consume alcohol,'' Berish
said.
   Congress last year approved in anti-drug legislation a provision
requiring that all beer, wine or liquor containers be labeled with
a warning that alcohol can cause health problems and birth defects.
The law goes into effect in November.
   An estimated 30,000 children are born in the United States each
year with fetal alcohol syndrome, according to a 1982 University of
Washington study.

   The remains of six Air Force servicemen killed
during the Vietnam War have been identified from among 38 sets of
remains repatriated by Vietnam on Dec. 15, the military said.
   The Army's Central Identification Laboratory announced the
identifications Wednesday. The Defense Department scheduled a full
military honors ceremony today for four of the men before their
remains are sent from Hickam Air Force Base near Honolulu to Travis
Air Force Base, Calif., for return to their families.
   The Defense Department identified the six lost over North
Vietnam as Col. Kenneth D. Robinson of Indianapolis; Maj. Sammie D.
Hoff of Kenedy, Texas; Maj. Robert R. Lynn of Jacksonville, Ill.;
Capt. Richard J. Mallon of Portland, Ore.; Capt. Donovan K. Walters
of Lebanon, Neb.; and Master Sgt. Charles J. Bebus of Osseo, Minn.
   Robinson and Hoff had been listed as missing in action since
Aug. 30, 1966; Lynn, Walters and Bebus since Dec. 21, 1972; and
Mallon since Jan. 28, 1970, military officials said.

   Mourners rioted today during the funeral of
a boy slain during an earlier demonstration against price
increases, and soldiers killed at least one person, sources said.
   Unrest was reported in villages near Kerak and south of the Dead
Sea, the latest violence in a wave of rioting that has left at
least seven people dead.
   A local reporter said he saw soldiers fatally shoot at least one
person and wound two people in Mazar, eight miles south of Kerak,
when demostrations occurred during a funeral today for a youth
slain on Wednesday.
   Family members identified the person killed today as Yacoub
Katawneh, a cousin of the slain youth, 13-year-old Ibrahim Katawneh.
   The reporter said a local official in Mazar on Wednesday shot
the youth and an air force major as a demonstration passed the
official's house. But authorities in Amman suggested the shooting
might have been a personal matter unrelated to the current unrest.
   The two deaths near Kerak, 50 miles south of Amman, were in
addition to five deaths reported Wednesday in Ma`an, 120 miles
south of Amman.
   Ma`an, where the disturbances first broke out Tuesday, remained
under curfew and was blockaded by the army, residents said.
   Other riots were reported in villages north of Kerak and at Ghor
Es-Safi south of the Dead Sea. There were no confirmed reports of
casualties.
   The government deployed troops on roads around population
centers throughout southern Jordan.
   Information Minister Hani Khasawneh told The Associated Press
today the riots were ``not a serious security threat,'' and said
the government had acted ``in full realization of the patriotism of
our people.''
   He said security agencies ``have been inquiring into these
incidents, especially the looting and setting fire to government
buildings, and the false phone contacts ... with foreign press
agencies.''
   The disturbances that broke out Tuesday in Ma`an apparently were
triggered by government-imposed increases in the prices of
gasoline, cigarettes and other items. The increases were announced
Sunday as part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
   The price increases came on the heels of an economic slide that
has sent per capita income tumbling to about $1,200 a year from
nearly $2,000 in the mid-1980s.
   In Washington, King Hussein told reporters Wednesday, ``I
believe everything is under control.''
   The official Jordan News Agency reported today that Crown Prince
Hassan, the king's brother, responded to the incidents by calling
for a conference to study the country's development needs.
   Yousef Azem, who represented maan in Jordan's now-suspended
Parliament, said leaders of the Maan region met in Amman on
Wednesday. He said they decided to seek calm in the region and to
prepare a list of demands to give the government.
   Hussein said the disturbances resulted from ``measures that had
to be taken as a result of the defaulting of several Arab states in
helping us'' _ a reference to the failure of Arab oil states to
meet a $1 billion yearly commitment to the kingdom agreed upon in
1978. We had to take some measures and obviously people feel them.''
   The price increases announced Sunday raised gasoline prices by
25 percent to $1.65 a gallon, and raised the cost of cigarettes,
telephone calls, heating oil and cooking gas by 10 percent to 50
percent.
   Prices of other commodities also have risen sharply the past
year because of a devaluation of the Jordanian dinar on world
markets.
   But local incomes have remained stable, often at about $175 to
$275 monthly. An economic slowdown has caused unemployment to rise
to as high as 20 percent by some estimates.
   Rioters in Ma`an, Kerak and other cities have stoned police,
burned official cars and attacked banks, government offices and
shops with stones and fire.

<HEAD>Moslem Clerics Challenge Israeli Ban of Worshipers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moslem clerics today urged Palestinians to defy
an Israeli order barring some worshipers from Jerusalem's Al Aqsa
mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites. Ten Palestinians were
reported wounded in clashes in the Gaza Strip.
   Sheikh Mohammed Al Jamal, a leading preacher at Al Aqsa, called
on Moslems throughout the occupied territories to attend noon
prayers at the mosque Friday to challenge the ban.
   The order was enacted after Palestinians stoned police in the
mosque compound following prayers on April 7, the first Friday of
the Moslem holy month of Ramadan.
   The mosque compound, known as Haram Al Sharif or Noble Enclosure
in Arabic, is the third-holiest site of Islam after Mecca and
Medina in Saudi Arabia.
   ``We call on Moslems to perform Friday prayers at Al Aqsa
mosque,'' Al Jamal told reporters at a news conference.
   ``If the Israeli authorities prevent them from entering the
mosque, they are to pray in the Old City of Jerusalem. If they are
barred from entering the city, they are to pray on the roads
leading to Jerusalem,'' he said.
   Hassan Tahboub, a former administrator of Al Aqsa, said the
Israeli order, which permits police to bar Palestinians at random
from the mosque, amounted to punishing all Moslem worshipers.
   ``This is not acceptable at all. The authorities must rescind
their decision,'' Tahboub said.
   Al Jamal challenged Israeli claims that during the April 7 riot
Palestinian protesters aimed rocks at Jews praying at the adjacent
Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
   ``Moslems did not throw rocks intentionally at the Western Wall.
They were throwing stones at police in response to their firing
tear gas and rubber bullets at worshipers,'' and some stones fell
on the nearby Jewish shrine, Al Jamal said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Israeli troops shot and
wounded six Palestinians during clashes in the village of Beit
Hanoun, the Nuseirat, Shati and Khan Yunis refugee camps, and the
town of Rafah, Arab doctors said.
   They said the wounded included a 10-year-old boy and three
14-year-old boys. Doctors also said the wounded included a
40-year-old Beit Hanoun woman was treated after soldiers beat her
and broke her left arm.
   An army official confirmed one of the casualties reported by
Arab doctors. He also said two people were injured in the village
of Bani Suheila and two more were injured in Rafah.
   Since the December 1987 start of the Palestinian uprising, 439
Palestinians and eighteen Israelis have been killed.
   In the occupied West Bank, doctors from Hebron's Alia Hospital
said a 14-year-old boy from the nearby village of Yatta was
hospitalized late Wednesday with third-degree burns after an
explosive device went off in his hands.
   At least two Palestinians have been killed and a dozen wounded
by unidentified exploding objects in the West Bank. The army has
said the devices may be unexploded flares dropped by army aircraft
during training flights.

   A 19-year-old who lost his life when
he gave up a stadium seat to be near friends was remembered today
in the first of 95 funerals for soccer fans who died in a weekend
sports disaster.
   More than 500 friends and relatives filed into Christ Church in
the Waterloo area of the city for the funeral of Gary Church, a
carpenter. He was buried at a local cemetery.
   Inside his coffin was a small card made by his 6-year-old niece,
Claire. It read: ``Uncle Gary, I loved you.''
   Church had a ticket for a seat in Sheffield's Hillsborough
Stadium but gave it up to stand with friends in the cheaper
standing-room section, where 95 people were crushed or trampled
Saturday when late-arriving fans crowded in.
   Fans and police have been trading accusations over who was
responsible for the tragedy.
   Police have said drunkenness by Liverpool fans played a part.
But officers have been criticized for opening a gate that allowed
the late arrivals to pour into the match between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest.
   Police say they had no choice but to open the gate to relieve a
dangerous crush outside.
   At Church's service, the Rev. Ray Hutchinson alluded to the
controversy.
   He told the congregation, which included Liverpool soccer
players, that the message ``of caring and wanting to share your
burden of grief has been sadly marred by insensitive, distasteful
and very badly timed remarks which have been reported coming from
various quarters.
   ``But (here) the message is loud and clear and all the stronger
as our city again has to show its resilience to yet more pain and
suffering,'' he said.
   A report Wednesday in the Daily Express newspaper appeared to
support the police. It said three of the victims died in the crush
outside and that three others were badly hurt outside.
   Police said they could not immediately comment on the report.
   The Daily Express story quoted unidentified police eyewitnesses.
It was the first report of anyone dying outside the standing-room
section.
   Former Beatle Paul McCartney and other Liverpool-born pop stars
are rerecording a popular 1964 ballad, ``Ferry Across the Mersey,''
to raise money for the injured and the families of the dead.
   The song, performed in 1964 by the Liverpool band Gerry and the
Pacemakers, is about the northwest port city and the River Mersey
that flows through it.
   The band's lead singer, Gerry Marsden, is rerecording the song
at a London studio this week along with McCartney; The Christians,
a four-man band; and Holly Johnson, lead singer of the punk band
Frankie Goes to Hollywood, said Sue Foster, a spokeswoman for
record producer Peter Waterman.
   The record will be released May 2, and proceeds will go to the
official fund for injured victims and relatives.
   The Union of European Football Associations, Europe's top soccer
authority, announced today it would donate $120,000 toward helping
families of victims.

   A former nurse's aide was ordered to stand
trial on charges of killing five nursing home patients after her
one-time lover and co-worker testified that she claimed the
suffocations helped relieve stress.
   Gwendolyn Graham, 25, was bound over for trial on five counts of
murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder after a
District Court hearing Wednesday.
   ``She was always happy when one of them died,'' said her former
lesbian lover, Catherine Wood, who was also charged in the
killings. Wood testified that Graham tried or plotted to kill at
least five other patients, but was foiled when some of the elderly
men and women fought back.
   The two counts of murder pending against Wood will be dropped in
exchange for her testimony, according to a plea bargain announced
earlier. She has agreed to plead guilty to one count of
second-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder.
   Wood lived with Graham in the first half of 1987, when Wood
testified that they attempted to kill enough patients to spell the
word ``murder'' with the victims' initials.
   ``I asked her why and she told me it relieved her tension,''
said Wood, who wept as she testified.
   Defense attorney James Piazza contended there was no proof that
any of the patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home died of unnatural
causes, and said that Wood was trying to take revenge on Graham for
leaving Wood for another woman.
   However, District Judge Sherwin Venema ruled there was
sufficient evidence for Graham to stand trial. She could face life
in prison without parole if convicted.
   Wood, 27, said she was upset after witnessing the suffocation of
the first victim, 60-year-old Marguerite Chambers, in January 1987.
Graham promised her the killing would stop, she said.
   But when another female patient died after struggling with
Graham, Wood said Graham took that as a sign ``that it was supposed
to go on.'' Graham took a souvenir from each victim, including
earrings, anklets and handkerchiefs, Wood testified.
   Wood said she went along with the killings because ``I thought
Gwen was the first person to ever love me, and I didn't want her to
leave me.''
   Police began investigating the deaths after Wood's ex-husband
reported alleged confessions by his former wife. Both women remain
jailed without bond.

   An ultralight helicopter crashed and
burned in a shopping center parking lot before dawn today, killing
both people aboard, a Fire Department spokesman said.
   There were no injuries on the ground, but parts of the aircraft
struck and caved in the roof over some businesses, Inspector Marty
Galindo said.
   The Federal Aviation Administratin was called to investigate the
crash in this city 75 miles east of San Francisco.
   Officials had not detemined the sex or identities of the victims
because their bodies were burned beyond recognition, Galindo added.
It also was unclear where the copter was traveling.
   ``Nobody knows where it came from,'' Galindo said. ``That small
an aircraft typically doesn't have a radio.''
   A power line was found severed at the scene.
   ``Whether or not the helicopter was in trouble before it hit the
line or hitting the line contributed to the accident remains to be
determined,'' Galindo said.
   Ultralight aircraft typically are powered by small engines that
allow them to fly only 100 feet or so above the ground. Pilots and
passengers normally are in an exposed cockpit.

   Police in Adolf Hitler's hometown today
arrested at least eight people on the dictator's 100th birthday and
turned back several others at the West German border in an effort
to head off neo-Nazi violence.
   Hundreds of police roamed the area, helicopters circled overhead
and police vehicles were spotted as far as 10 miles from this town.
   The security measures were aimed at preventing a repeat of
clashes between neo-Nazis and left-wing opponents on Hitler's 90th
birthday.
   By midmorning, a constant stream of dozens of curious onlookers
clustered near Hitler's birthplace, which was sealed off by metal
barriers.
   Dozens of police cars blocked the street leading to the house
that is now a nursery for handicapped children. Many stores closed
and at least two shops boarded their front windows.
   A police spokesman said two Austrians, three Italians, two
Germans and one American were detained and face fines of up to
$2,300 dollars.
   The Italians, one of the Austrians and the American were seen
raising their hands for the Nazi salute, said a police official who
did not give his name. Earlier, officials erroneously had reported
that all five were Italian.
   One West German was picked up by gendarmerie after he shouted
Nazi slogans and spat at reporters. He was in possession of a large
knife, the police official said.
   Another West German also shouted anti-Semitic and Nazi slogans _
``Jew, go and rot'' and ``This will be a national holiday in 100
years' time'' _ as he was dragged away.
   Police declined to identify those detained. Schindler indicated
they would face misdemeanor charges and not more serious criminal
charges under an Austrian law that bans neo-Nazi activity.
   On Wednesday, four unidentified Americans, an Irishman and a
West German were ordered by police to change their clothes after
arriving in Braunau in black boots and brown shirts reminiscent of
the Nazi uniform, police said.
   Police said ``several people'' were turned back at the nearby
West German border. A spokesman declined to give details.
   In West Germany, scores of foreigners closed their shops and
many others kept their children out of schools in Hamburg today
because of fears of violence, officials said.
   In West Berlin, police arrested nine members of self-styled
``protection troops'' that had been cruising the streets to prevent
neo-Nazi attacks on foreigners and Jewish landmarks.
   West Berlin police also said that a Turkish cemetery was
vandalized early today. More than 38 gravemarkers were overturned
or damaged, officials said.
   The anniversary got little mention in West German newspapers,
but a senior official warned of possible violence by neo-Nazi
groups against foreigners.
   Peter Frisch, vice-president of the Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution in Frankfurt, said there are about
30,000 rightist extremists in West Germany, including about 1,500
neo-Nazis.
   Turks in recent years have flocked to West Germany in search of
jobs, triggering resentment among many working-class Germans.
Rightist groups have made foreign workers a political issue, and
the extremist Republican Party, campaigning on a platform opposed
to foreign workers, recently made surprising gains in some West
German municipal elections.
   ``They (the Turks) have assumed the role that the Jews played in
the Nazi ideology,'' Frisch said on the North German radio station.
   Hitler was born in the two-story house on April 20, 1889 and
spent the first three years of his life in Braunau, just miles from
the West German border. He committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin
on April 30, 1945, having ordered his body burned.
   In 1979, neo-Nazis and left-wingers clashed in the village
before police broke up the rival groups. No serious injuries were
reported then.
   Police said three anonymous letters were received threatening
violence this year on the ``Hitler House,'' Socialist Mayor Gerhard
Skiba and an anti-fascist memorial opposite the house.
   Skiba said the memorial, erected April 5, was intended to show
that Braunau's 10,000 residents oppose Nazism and remember its
millions of victims. It was made of granite from the quarry once
worked by thousands of prisoners at the former Nazi concentration
camp, Mauthausen.

   Scores of foreigners closed their
shops and many others kept their children out of schools in Hamburg
today because of fears of violence on the 100th anniversary of
Adolf Hitler's birth.
   In West Berlin, police arrested nine members of self-styled
``protection troops'' that police said had been cruising the
streets in cars to prevent neo-Nazi attacks against foreigners and
Jewish landmarks.
   West Berlin police also said a Turkish cemetery in the city had
been vandalized early today. More than 38 grave stones were
overturned or damaged, officials said.
   In Hamburg districts that have a large foreign population, a
``considerable number'' of parents kept their children out of
schools,'' a school board spokesman said. The spokesman, who
requested anonymity, said the parents were reacting to a ``hysteria
campaign that was not founded on facts.''
   Neo-Nazi leaflets circulating in Hamburg in recent days
threatened violence against foreign school children and other
ethnic groups.
   Hamburg's chief school administrator, Rosemarie Raab, toured
several schools with a large number of foreign pupils.
   Some foreign shopowners closed their stores today in Hamburg.
Police said they were not aware of any neo-Nazi actions.
   On Wednesday evening, Hamburg police briefly detained 41 foreign
youths who had formed a group to defend against possible neo-Nazi
attacks. Police said they seized 14 knives and seven pistols that
fire tear gas or Mace.
   In West Berlin, police arrested six young men early today after
they were seen driving around a synagogue.
   A police statement said the six had a pistol that fires tear
gas, helmets, clubs and a gasoline canister in the car. The six
wore anti-Nazi emblems and some had jackets displaying a swastika
being destroyed by a fist.
   Police arrested two men and a woman in another car and also
seized knives, steel bars and other weapons. The three had a list
of 40 places singled out to be watched, police said.
   Police said leftist groups apparently formed patrols to respond
to any possible violence by the neo-Nazis.
   Leftist activists also set up a hotline and urged citizens to
report any incidents involving neo-Nazis.
   West Berlin has many foreign workers and a far-right party, the
Republicans, won seats in the local legislature for the first time
in January's election after a vitriolic campaign against foreigners.
   In the Bavarian mountain resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen,
police said a large wooden swastika was set alight late Wednesday.
No arrests were made.
   Peter Frisch, vice-president of the Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution in Frankfurt, said foreigners,
particularly Turks, are likely targets of the violence.
   Turks in recent years have flocked to West Germany in search of
jobs, triggering resentment among many working-class Germans.
Rightist groups have made foreign workers a political issue.
   ``They (the Turks) have assumed the role that the Jews played in
the Nazi ideology,'' Frisch said on the North German radio station.

<HEAD>Lottery Rollover Means Highest Jackpot In Pennsylvania History</HEAD>

   Lottery players began queuing up today to buy
tickets for next week's state lottery jackpot, which is projected
to top $62 million and will be the second-largest in U.S. history.
   ``We'll just be jammed. We were jammed this morning as soon as
we opened'' at 6:30 a.m., said June Gerken, who sells tickets for
the Super 7 lottery from a balloon shop she operates in Pittsburgh
with her husband, Larry.
   Despite record sales, no ticket sold for Wednesday's drawing
contained seven winning numbers for the jackpot of at least $42
million.
   Lottery officials set next Wednesday's jackpot at $62 million
based on projected ticket sales. The jackpot will be at least that
much and could go higher, spokeswoman Terry Murphy said today.
   The nation's highest lottery jackpot of $69.9 million came just
last week in Illinois. That jackpot was split among four winning
ticket holders after Saturday's drawing. The previous record, set
last fall, was a $61.98 million jackpot split among buyers of three
tickets in the California lottery.
   The largest single winner was a Florida woman who won $55.16
million in that state's lottery in September 1988.
   In the Pennsylvania lottery's ``Super 7'' game, players pick
seven out of 80 numbers. The lottery then picks 11 numbers, and the
winner is anyone whose choices are any seven of the 11 numbers. The
odds of winning are calculated at one in 9.6 million.
   Sally Carpenter, manager of Dunkin Donuts in Woodlyn, said only
a few people have bought tickets this morning for next week's
drawing.
   ``They seem to all wait to the end, and I don't know why,'' she
said.
   ``Most people are in shock. They can't believe it didn't go last
night. They're all excited. They feel they've got another chance,''
said Dorothy DeLuca, who runs the lottery machine at DeLuca's State
News and Variety Store in Erie. ``We have people who don't know how
to play playing.''
   Lottery officials braced for a record number of ticket buyers in
the coming week and advised buyers to use the computer to pick the
numbers, to speed up the sales.
   Lottery official Michael Keyser said a record 29,258,972 tickets
were sold for Wednesday night's drawing, exceeding the previous
number of 27,662,192 on Oct. 14, 1987, when a Hollidaysburg couple
won the previous largest state jackpot of $46 million.

<HEAD>State Department Sends Notice on Discrimination Against Women</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to include confirmation from attorney, adds quotes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has sent cables to U.S.
embassies around the world and posted notifications acknowledging a
district court finding of discrimination against female Foreign
Service officers between 1976 and 1985, an attorney involved in the
case said today.
   The agency also has informed about 600 women working in the
Foreign Service that they may be entitled to court-ordered relief.
   The actions stem from a suit filed in 1976 by Alison Palmer, a
now-retired Foreign Service officer who claimed the department
discriminated against women in hiring and promotion, said Ms.
Palmer's attorney, Monica Wagner.
   However, Ms. Wagner said her client will not be a direct
beneficiary of the court order because she has retired from the
foreign service. Only those women who are part of the class-action
suit and are still working for the Foreign Service are affected.
   ``The benefit for her is in seeing the State Department take
action with respect to the sex discrimination found by the court,''
Ms. Wagner said.
   The State Department had won the Palmer lawsuit in a lower court
but was reversed three months ago by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia. The State Department has informed the
court it is planning to appeal that decision.
   Ms. Palmer charged in her suit that the department discriminated
against women by hiring more men, giving men the better career
assignments and more career-advancing honors.
   The agency also has announced that it has postponed the Foreign
Service examination this year.
   The test has been challenged because men pass the general
background section at twice the rate of women.

   A hailstorm battered a city in southwest China's
Sichuan province early Thursday, killing 45 people and injuring
119, a news report said.
   The hailstorm struck Luzhou City shortly after midnight, and
lasted about half an hour, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   The storm cut of water, electricity and telephone services,
uprooted trees and smashed 40 percent of windows and doors in
high-rise buildings.
   Ten percent of single-story homes in the area collapsed. The
report did not give the population of the area.
   Xinhua said the exact casualty and damage figures were not
available because communications links with Luzhou were severed.
   The Sichuan government sent rescue teams to the area, it said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan may develop its own surface-to-air missile in
a $7.5 billion project, a news report said today.
   It would be the first anti-aircraft missile Japan developed
using its own technology, the leading economic newspaper Nihon
Keizai Shimbun said.
   The report comes as Tokyo and Washington remain mired in
disagreement over a proposal to jointly develop a new fighter jet.
   An official in the Finance Ministry's Budget Bureau confirmed
$30 million were earmarked in the budget for fiscal year 1989 for
``study expenses'' for the missile but refused to elaborate.
   Japan's budget for the current fiscal year, which began April 1,
has not been approved by Parliament because of an opposition
boycott tied to a bribery scandal. Instead, the government is
operating on a 50-day provisional budget.
   The newspaper said the Defense Agency plans three years of
research into areas such as radar and infrared sensors and guidance
systems before beginning development of the new missile.
   The missile would replace the Patriot, which Japan produces
under license from the United States under a 1985 agreement. Japan
plans to deploy 26 Japanese-made Patriot systems over the next 10
years to replace its aging Nike-J missiles.
   One Patriot system is estimated to cost $521 million and is made
up of 20 Patriot missiles, a launcher, and radar and firing control
equipment. It is capable of attacking multiple airborne targets
within a range of 100 miles.
   The newspaper said the plan to use Japanese technology to
develop the new missile system might bring a negative reaction from
the United States, which has provided Japan with much of its main
defense technology.
   The United States may propose joint development of the new
missile system, as in the case of Japan's controversial
next-generation jet fighter, the FSX, it said. Last year, Japan and
the United States agreed that private companies from the two
countries will jointly develop and produce a new jet fighter for
Japan in a project worth more than $8 billion.
   The move was a compromise after Washington wanted Japan to buy
U.S.-built planes while Tokyo wanted to develop its own aircraft.
   But the two countries are currently reviewing the agreement
because of opposition from some U.S. congressmen who charge that
the project would be a ``giveaway'' of U.S. aviation technology.

   Hundreds of subway train drivers on Thursday
staged their second 24-hour strike this month to protest
cost-cutting measures, bringing the system to a near-standstill.
   Buses and roads were crowded during the morning rush-hour with 3
million subway commuters trying to find other ways to enter the
city during the worst of the two unofficial strikes on the
126-year-old London Underground.
   Only three of the 10 subway lines were operating, but services
were reduced to about one-third or half of normal, a transit
spokesman said.
   In the April 5 strike, three lines operated fully and others
offered partial services.
   Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of the Underground, said
the striking drivers were ignoring union advice to keep working.
   Drivers on strike were demanding more money for working on
trains that eventually will be operated alone after the phasing out
of conductors who open and close doors.
   The subway employs 2,400 drivers.

<HEAD>EPA Officials Urge School Officials to Test Buildings for Radon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency urged
school officials today to test all school buidings for radon,
saying preliminary tests from 16 states show many schools have
unhealthy levels of the cancer-causing gas.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly said although the test results
were only preliminary, the levels found were high enough to warrant
nationwide testing of school buildings.
   ``It is important that school administrators nationwide
understand both the seriousness of the risk and the relative
simplicity of testing and fixing the problem,'' said Reilly in
remarks prepared for the National Press Club.
   ``Based on measurements taken in 3,000 schoolrooms in 16 states,
it appears that elevated levels of radon gas can be found in
schools throughout the United States,'' Reilly said. He called
indoor radon ``one of the major environmental health threats facing
Americans.''
   Radon is a colorless and odorless gas that is produced naturally
by the decay of Radium-226 in soil and rocks. While levels normally
found outdoors _ 0.2 to 0.7 picocurie per liter _ pose no health
concerns, there are higher accumulations that are of concern when
the gas is trapped indoors.
   Scientists estimate that as many as 15 percent of the lung
cancer deaths annually may be related to indoor radon exposure over
a lifetime. The EPA has said exposure levels of 4 picocuries per
liter of air over a lifetime is equivalent to smoking a half pack
of cigarettes a day.
   The EPA findings on radon levels in schools came from two-day
tests conducted at 130 schools in 16 states. The tests were
conducted in 3,000 rooms normally occupied by students, teachers or
other school employees, said EPA spokeswoman Martha Casey.
   According to the figures from the schools tested, 54 percent of
the schools had at least one room in which radon levels were found
to exceed the 4 picocuries per liter of air considered by the EPA
to be unhealthy and reflect a need for additional tests and likely
corrective action.
   The EPA said of the 3,000 rooms tested, 19 percent had levels of
4 picocuries or greater and 3 percent had levels of at least 20
picocuries. It was unclear how many of the schools had rooms with
levels of 20 picocuries or greater.
   The highest level was found in a schoolroom in Tennesse where
136 picocuries per liter were detected, an exposure similar to that
found in uranium mines where workers are urged to use respirators
for breathing, the EPA said.
   Ms. Casey said no list of schools was available, although she
said state authorities and the school officials involved have been
told of the test results.
   The agency said actual exposure received by children is
difficult to determine from the test data because in many schools
students move from room to room on a given day and various rooms in
a single school may have widely different levels of radon.
   In addition to Tennessee, schools were tested in Washington,
Montana, Nevada, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota,
Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Georgia, New Jersey
and Maine.
   Last September, the EPA urged all homeowners to conduct radon
tests after unhealthy levels of radon were found in one out of four
homes tested in 17 states.
   There are no federal laws or regulations requiring radon tests
or corrective action to be taken in either schools or private homes.

<HEAD>Panther Reintroduction Program Halted After Texas Cougar Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have cut short an
experiment aimed at learning if the endangered Florida panther can
ever again survive outside the Everglades.
   The experiment in north Florida was halted after the deaths of
four of seven Texas cougars used as surrogates for their Florida
cousins. The remaining two in the wild were captured this week near
Osceola National Forest, according to Tom Logan, chief of the
Wildlife Research Bureau at the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission. The seventh was caught last week.
   ``The two animals would not have given us any new information.
We don't feel it's prudent or productive to leave the animals out
in the field,'' Logan said Wednesday.
   The Texas cougar, a subspecies related to the Florida panther,
was being studied to see how it adapted to north Florida. Both big
cats are closely related to the mountain lion or puma.
   The Florida panther once roamed north Florida's woods but is now
confined to the Everglades of south Florida where officials
estimate no more than 50 survive. The last confirmed north Florida
sighting of one was the early 1960s.
   Of the seven Texas cats in the experiment, one died of unknown
causes, two were shot by poachers and a fourth had to be killed
after it was injured while being captured by wildlife officers.
   In addition to the two caught this week, one was removed from
the wild last week after it took to hunting exotic deer at a
private hunting preseve.
   Wildlife officials had planned to end the program in June, a
year after the release of the first five Texas cougars.
   ``When we had the original group, they behaved as they should.
When the numbers were reduced, things started happening,'' Logan
said. ``We need to evaluate the number of animals out there and how
it affects them.''
   Until information from the experiment is evaluated, Logan said
he could not recommend whether Florida panthers should be released
in north Florida.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today ``my conscience is
clear'' about the Iran-Contra affair and promised to cooperate
fully with congressional requests for White House documents dealing
with the matter.
   However, Bush said it was not clear that any documents are still
within his control, saying ``I think they're in the control and
custody of the archivist.'' He said he had no reason to believe
that the Reagan administration withheld any documents.
   Meeting with a small group of reporters at the White House, the
president stuck by his earlier refusal to discuss his role in the
Iran-Contra affair. But, he added, ``Everything I've said, I'll
stand behind.''
   Documents introduced at the trial of former White House aide
Oliver North have raised new questions about Bush's involvement,
while vice president, in the Reagan administration's secret aid to
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Bush talked about the Iran-Contra affair and other matters
during an informal news conference with nine reporters. He chose an
informal setting for the gathering, meeting with the press on the
colonnade outside the Oval Office on a sunny spring day.
   Bush said he ``might have something to say'' about the
Iran-Contra affair after the completion of North's trial, which was
in its final stages today. North is accused of lying to Congress
and obstructing a congressional investigation, among other charges.
   The president has declined in recent days to field questions on
Iran-Contra, saying he didn't want to prejudice the North case.
However, he said today, ``Let's put it this way, my conscience is
clear.''
   On other subjects Bush:
   _Expressed anguish about the shelling in Lebanon, saying he
wished he had ``some dramatic plan the players could agree to. It's
not there.''
   _Said his administration, which is nearing the 100-day mark, is
``moving reasonably well and I don't even think in terms of 100
days.'' Citing his broad budget agreement with Congress and
congressional action on his plan to rescue the savings and loan
industry, Bush said, ``We're making some progress.''
   The president added, ``I don't feel a need for some precipitous
and dramatic initiative in order to salve the conscience of those
who are saying you've got to do something in 100 days.''
   _Said he has not had any discussions nor made any decision about
offering military aid to the non-communist resistance in Cambodia.
   _Said he has not made a decision on how to modernize the nuclear
arsenal. Bush said he will be prepared ``very soon to make a
decision'' on funding for the Star Wars anti-missile system and
whether to continue deployment of the MX missile or fund
development of a single-warhead Midgetman missile.
   Questions about the Iran-Contra affair focused on the charges
that some documents produced in North's trial were not turned over
to the congressional committees that investigated the issue.
   Bush said he has seen no evidence that all pertinent documents
were not made available.
   However, he said, ``I would offer full cooperation for any, any
request made of this administration.''
   Asked if would release any documents that Congress wants to see,
the president said:
   ``Well, procedures were set up to determine what documents were
to be made available. Those procedures were agreed to by the
Congress, and certainly I would see that if any documents are in
control of this administration, relevant documents, that we would,
we would live assiduously by those guidelines.
   ``But I have no reason to believe that the previous
administration, the lawyers in it who worked closely with Congress,
did not fulfill their obligation.''
   Asked, then, if he would cooperate fully in any Senate
investigation, Bush said he would ``defer then to the people who
were in charge of the documentation, which would be Mr. (Arthur)
Culvahouse (Reagan's White House counsel) and company, in whom I
have great confidence, but if there's anything we can do to
encourage that, absolutely.''
   On another subject, Bush said he was not prepared announce any
restrictions now on semi-automatic weapons, which have figured in a
wave of violence, much of it spawned by drug dealers.
   ``I have expressed my concern about these weapons and their
suitability so stay tuned. I don't know exactly when it (an
announcement) will be,'' he said.
   Asked if thought interest rates should come down in view of the
agreement with Congress on the budget, Bush said: ``I was very
pleased with the market reaction to the budget agreement. It seems
to have been under-reported, but nevertheless, it's sort of

   However, he added, ``I'm not heartened by the (rising) interest
rates.''

<HEAD>Students Occupy College of Wooster Administration Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOOSTER, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at the College of Wooster occupied
the campus administration building today, locking out
administrators and staff to press for a stronger black studies
program and other changes.
   The takeover of Galpin Hall occurred about 6 a.m. as the
building was opened, college spokesman Jeff Hanna said. He said
about 20 black and white students appeared to be involved.
   ``I don't think it is any one group,'' Hanna said. ``It's just
students; student leaders from a number of groups are involved.''
   Students were at each of the four entrances to the building and
were denying access to administrators and staff, although some
faculty members had entered, Hanna said. The takeover continued
late this morning.
   The private, liberal arts college in northeast Ohio has an
enrollement of 1,800, and about 5 percent of the students are
black, Hanna said.
   College President Henry Copeland met with the students for about
45 minutes on the back steps of the building and intended to meet
with them again, Hanna said.
   The students have listed several demands, including a black
studies requirement; hiring of more black faculty and advisers; and
the selling off of stock in companies that do business in South
Africa.
   ``These are all issues the college has been addressing and will
continue to address,'' Hanna said. ``We've been having discussions
on these concerns for maybe three weeks.''
   In Detroit, about 100 students at Wayne State University are in
the second week of a protest also calling for more minority studies
and minority hiring. The students have occupied a building housing
registration and student loan offices since April 12.

<HEAD>Relatives Say Stalin's Daughter Wanted Her Own Son Exiled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Svetlana Alliluyeva, daughter of dictator Josef
Stalin, scandalized her relatives during her stay in the Soviet
Union and demanded her son be exiled to a remote Pacific island, an
article published Thursday said.
   Alliluyeva's son, Josef, was quoted in the newspaper Soviet
Culture as saying his mother wrote his superiors demanding he be
kicked out of the Communist Party, stripped of his academic degree
and ``the funniest of all _ she's demanding that after all that I
be sent to Sakhalin!''
   The newspaper's article, which contained revelations about a
leader's family life still rare in the Soviet press, was part of a
wave of public re-examination of all aspects of Josef Stalin's long
rule of terror.
   Alliluyeva defected from the Soviet Union in 1967 and returned
in 1984 at age 58, saying she wanted to be reunited with her
family. A year and a half later, she wrote a letter to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev asking permission to leave, citing poor
relations with relatives.
   She has returned to her former home in Wisconsin.
   In an interview soon after her second departure, she said that
despite the special treatment she received in the Soviet Union, she
felt estranged from her son and his wife and other relatives whom
she later joined in Soviet Georgia, her father's birthplace.
   N.V. Stalina, Alliluyeva's niece, said she created ``most
disgusting scenes'' while on vacation with a cousin. ``For her, it
meant nothing to humiliate another person,'' she told Maj. A.
Kolesnik, who wrote the article based on newly opened archives and
personal interviews.
   In a letter to Kolesnik, Alliliuyeva's nephew, Y. Dzhugashvili,
furnished the quotes on Sakhalin, a former prison colony off
Eastern Siberia, from his conversations with Iosif Alliluyev, and
said Svetlana seemed unwilling at first to meet with her son.
   In the 1986 interview, Alliluyeva said that her son had changed
unrecognizably in the 17 years since she had seen him, and that she
thought he had been instructed to invite her back to the Soviet
Union, perhaps by the KGB.
   Alliluyeva brought her 13-year-old American-born daughter, Olga
Peters, with her when she came back to the Soviet Union in 1984.
   In both Moscow and the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, she was
given special privileges including the use of a car and a luxury
apartment.
   ``I'm sure she always felt a crown on her head, despite her
modest clothing, and often gave orders, and she repeatedly insulted
her daughter,'' Dzhugashvili told Soviet Culture.
   ``When she left Tbililsi, she announced that `she was tired of
living among savages,''' Dzhugashvili said.
   Alliluyeva's move to Moscow and back to the West were acclaimed
as propaganda coups, but she maintained that her reasons for the
moves were purely personal.
   When she returned to the United States, she vowed she would
never again return to the Soviet Union.

   The explosion in a 16-inch gun turret aboard
the battleship USS Iowa may have been caused by red-hot debris from
a firing left in the breech, a former commander of the ship said
today.
   Capt. Larry Seaquist, the Iowa's commanding officer until last
May, refused to speculate on the exact cause of the accident that
left 47 sailors dead.
   But he told reporters at a Pentagon briefing that an air system
to clear debris from the breech must be operated manually, raising
the possibility that the procedure was overlooked before fresh
gunpowder was loaded into the gun during a firing exercise.
   ``It seems from the reports that those powders exploded,''
Seaquist said.
   ``We simply do not know what caused that powder to go,'' he
said. ``The early reports are that it was up in that gun room,''
immediately behind the gun breeches.
   Other Navy officers, speaking on condition they not be
identified by name, said red-hot debris ``seems to be the logical
explanation'' for the explosion.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Fred Hoffman, confirmed that the explosion
occurred ``during a firing exercise.''
   One of the 47 men killed in the explosion was the lone officer
stationed in the turret, Phillip Edward Buch, lieutenant junior
grade, from Las Cruces, N.M.
   The officer would normally be stationed in a small compartment
at the rear of the swivelling top of the turrent, adjacent to the
room in which shells are loaded.
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, en route home from a NATO
meeting in Brussels, said ``we have no eyewitnesses to what
actually transpired.''
   ``I've been told in reports today that everyone who was in the
turret at the time of the explosion was killed,'' Cheney said,
apparently referring to the swiveling gun house at the top of the
turret, rather than the mechanical compartments and ammunition
magazines below it.
   Under questioning by reporters, Seaquist said one possible cause
of the explosion was debris left in the breech from a previous
firing.
   To clear the breech of such debris, he said, a sailor must
manually activate a one-inch tube containing air pressurized at
3,000 pounds per square inch, and then visually inspect the breech.
   ``It ejects the gases out of the muzzle of the gun,'' he said.
   ``Each of these men is well-trained and formally qualified to do
this,'' he said, and they drill regularly.
   The turret and the ship are constructed of thick steel and are
designed in such a way that a fire or explosion in one compartment
of the turret will not spread to other sections, ignite powder
magazines and spread the damage.
   ``This gun, the Mark VII, 16-inch 50 gun remains the finest
naval gun in the world. It was the pinnacle of gun design art, and
it is still a front-line system,'' Seaquist said.
   ``It was designed specifically to contain this kind of damage,
to limit the cascading effects,'' he said, referring to explosions
that occurred aboard ships of earlier designs.
   At some point during the accident Wednesday, the crew flooded
the turret, activating an overhead sprinkler system that sprays the
compartments with pressurized salt water while still allowing
sailors to scramble through exit hatches.
   A complement of 74 sailors normally work inside each turret,
said Seaquist.
   Hoffman said ``the reports coming in from the ship indicate that
it was fully manned at the time of the firing ... There were
survivors (in the turret).''
   Hoffman said he could not say whether all of those killed were
inside the turret at the time of the explosion.
   To launch a 1,900-pound projectile from the 62-foot-long
barrels, a team of sailors packs six gunpowder canisters weighing
110 pounds each into the breech, Seaquist said.
   The black gunpowder, a total of 660 pounds, is ignited,
propelling the shell from the barrel at a speed of 1,500 miles an
hour, he said. ``They actually don't explode. They burn extremely
rapidly ... in a matter of a fraction of a second.''
   Hoffman declined to speculate on the exact cause of the
explosion, saying that Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander
of the USS New Jersey, a sister ship to the Iowa, was directing the
Navy board inquiry.
   ``An investigation into the incident has already begun,''
Hoffman said. He declined to predict when the inquiry would be
finished, reviewed by the Navy and Defense Department, and then
released in summary to the public.
   ``The ship ... experienced an explosion and a fire in its No. 2
turret about 10 a.m. yesterday some 200 miles Northeast of Puerto
Rico,'' said Hoffman. ``The ship was part of an exercise called
Fleetex-389.''
   ``Reports from the Iowa say that 47 crewmen are dead. Between 10
and 12 have suffered minor injuries. Most of these, I understand,
are in the fire-fighting parties, Hoffman said. ``There are no
serious injuries, and all those who have been hurt have been
treated aboard ship.''
   Each of the three turrets aboard the Iowa has three 16-inch
guns, is as tall as a seven-story building, and weighs 1,800 tons,
as much as a World War II destroyer, Seaquist said.
   The 17{-inch armor is so thick, he said, that when a Japanese
shell hit the No. 3 turret aboard the Iowa in World War II, ``the
crew inside didn't even know they had been hit. Now that is safety
that comes from this massive armor and the compartmentation.''
   No one is known to have died in combat aboard the Iowa during a
career that spanned World War II, the Korean War and patrol duty
off the mouth of the Persian Gulf last year.
   The black gunpowder used aboard the Iowa was manufactured during
the Korean War, and stored in Crane, Ind., in sealed bins, Seaquist
said.
   When the Iowa was recommissioned in 1984, the Navy emixed the
gunpower, tested it and repacked it into the 110-pound charges that
are stored in a magazines at the base of the turret. The charges
are passed through revolving doors designed to seal the magazine
from the rest of the turret and the ship.

<HEAD>Rushdie Supporters Urge Boycott of Iran Book Fair</HEAD>
<HEAD>Embargoed For Release 7 p.m. EDT _ Time Set by Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of Salman Rushdie, the novelist under
an Iranian death sentence, voiced dismay Thursday at plans by
British and other Western publishers to exhibit at next month's
Tehran Book Fair.
   ``We are concerned that participation by publishers in this
event will be interpreted by the Iranian government and others as
an acceptance of the death threat,'' said a statement by the
International Committee for the Defense of Salman Rusdhie and His
Publishers.
   Rushdie has been in hiding for two months since Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini said the Bombay-born British writer's novel,
``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam and sentenced him to death.
   The committee said the May 7-19 book fair, specializing in
scientific, technical and medical books, is being run by the
Iranian Ministry of Islamic Culture.
   It said the Iranians had withdrawn an invitation to Viking
Penguin, Rushdie's publishers, but said other publishers from
around the world, including Britain, would participate.
   The statement urged them to make clear to Iran their
condemnation of the death threat, and to show support for
international efforts to have it withdrawn.
   The Rushdie committee was set up to organize protests by
free-speech groups, and collected signatures from more than 1,000
writers worldwide on a petition that was published free of charge
in newspapers in more than 20 countries March 2.
   The Oxford University Press is one of the publishers exhibiting
at the fair. Simon Wratten, sales director for the academic
division, said: ``We deliberated about it quite deeply but felt
that it certainly wasn't in our interests, or Iran's as a whole,''
to stay away.
   Nor, he said, would an exhibition of books on scientific
subjects ``be seen in any way as supporting the ayatollah's
decision,'' he said.
   In an interview, Wratten said the books already had been shipped
to Tehran, but the company had decided against sending
representatives, fearing they might face danger and be put in ``in
a very difficult position, whereby they would have to make some
sort of statement.''
   He said the decision was ``in line with other publishers,''
adding that American publishers also were planning to exhibit.
   After the death sentence was announced, The Bookseller, a trade
journal, reported that publishers were going ahead with exhibits
but would not send representatives, fearing for their safety.
   It quoted John Hudson, international sales manager for
scientific publisher Butterworth, as saying: ``As publishers, our
responsibilities are to individuals who want to read books, not to
governments. To send books to book fairs does not imply approval
for a regime, otherwise there would be many bookfairs we did not
participate in.''
   Hudson was not available for comment Thursday, but his office
said it was going ahead with its exhibit.

   With a somber
salute from honor guards, 47 flag-draped coffins bearing the
victims of the worst Navy disaster in more than a decade began
their trip home today.
   Helicopters brought ashore the bodies of those killed in
Wednesday's explosion inside a gun turret aboard the USS Iowa as
the huge battleship anchored offshore. Then, after a brief
ceremony, a plane bearing the bodies took off for a military
mortuary in Dower, Del., and the ship left for its home port of
Norfolk, Va.
   The Pentagon today put the death toll at 47 and said other crew
members were accounted for. Earlier, spokesmen had said the death
toll could be higher.
   Ten to 12 crew members, most of them firefighters, suffered
minor injuries. They were treated aboard ship and were back at work
today, the Navy said.
   A blue Navy van carrying the coffins to the airstrip were met by
special honor and color guards bearing the U.S., Navy and U.S.
Marine Corps flags. The guards saluted each coffin as eight sailors
acting as pallbearers placed them in the cavernous belly of a
camouflaged, C-5 Galaxy cargo plane.
   The cargo doors closed at 11:30 a.m. EDT and the plane began its
long flight to Dover.
   Some 100 reporters and photographers who had been allowed inside
the base for a press conference and to watch the boarding ceremony
were then told to leave and were not allowed back in.
   The blast occurred during a gunnery exercise while the
46-year-old ship was on maneuvers about 330 miles northeast of
Puerto Rico.
   The explosion and fire were in the second of the two forward
turrets, at the loading position of the center gun in the three-gun
turret, said Bruce Nason, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.
   Eleven crewmen inside the turret escaped, from a magazine area
at the bottom of the seven-story-high turret, said Vice Adm. Jerome
Johnson, commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet, who was aboard the Iowa.
   ``I can tell you the fire and explosion was instantaneous.
Because it was instantaneous, we have no other injuries,'' Johnson
told reporters at a Roosevelt Roads news conference this morning.
   The ship's captain decided to remain 10 to 15 miles out to sea
because the Iowa draws 36 to 38 feet of water and the Roosevelt
Roads harbor is only 40 feet deep, said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a
Navy spokesman. He said the ship would head for its home port in
Norfolk, Va., after all bodies were brought ashore.
   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said an investigation of the
incident has already begun and will be led by Rear Adm. Richard D.
Milligan, commander of Cruiser Destroyer Group 2 and a former
commanding officer of the battleship USS New Jersey.
   In Norfolk, about 200 relatives of the 1,600 crewmen aboard the
Iowa spent the night at a Norfolk Naval Station gym out of sight of
reporters. Military policy requires that families of dead or
injured personnel be notified before their names are released.
   ``There are those who are really struggling, and those who are
really stoic,''said Navy Chaplain Barry Brimhall. ``Right now, for
some of these families, they would rather have bad news than no
news at all.''
   In Temple, Texas, Lorene Barron said all she could do was pray
for her son, Monte Barron, and hope she would hear from the Navy by
telephone.
   ``They told me if he was among the deceased, they would
personally visit us,'' Mrs. Barron said. ``But I believe
everything's going to be OK. And I'm praying for all the mothers
who are waiting just like I am.''
   Lt. Russell A. Greer, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman in Norfolk,
said the explosion occurred while the ship was conducting open seas
gunnery practice, but did not know if it occurred as the gun was
being fired.
   Each gun's 16-inch-diameter projectile is propelled by
explosives in fabric bags loaded separately from the projectiles.
The gun requires up to five bags, each containing 110 pounds of
powder to fire a 2,700-pound round.
   Asked about the safety of the ship by reporters this morning,
President Bush said he would want to ensure that procedures were
checked ``to be sure that safety is at the highest point.''
   ``But I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that because that kind
of powder was put into these turrets in that way that that makes a
useful platform obsolete,'' Bush said.
   Naval officers familiar with the Iowa's gun turrets said an
explosion can occur if a gun breech, or back end of the barrel, is
cracked, or from a shell that ``cooks off'' _ ignites prematurely
from the heat of the barrel or smoldering debris left in the barrel
from the last round.
   ``The first thing that comes to mind is something like a
cook-off,'' said Capt. Paul Hanley, another spokesman for the
Atlantic Fleet. ``It could have been a (powder) bag, or a
projectile. We just don't know yet.''
   Capt. Larry Seaquist, the Iowa's commanding officer until last
May, told reporters at a Pentagon briefing that a compressed air
system to clear hot debris from the breech must be operated
manually, raising the possibility that the procedure was overlooked
before fresh gunpowder was loaded into the gun.
   ``Each of these men is well-trained and formally qualified to do
this,'' he said, and they drill regularly.
   It was the worst loss of life in a naval accident since 1977,
when 49 sailors died when a 56-foot launch returning sailors from
shore leave in Barcelona, Spain, to the USS Guam and the USS
Trenton was hit by a Spanish freighter.
   An Iraqi missile attack on the USS Stark in May 1987 killed 37
crewmen and wounded 21.
   A similiar explosion occurred in the center gun turret aboard
the heavy cruiser USS Newport News during the Vietnam War in
October 1972, killing 20 crewmen and injuring 36.
   ``It is a great tragedy and a matter of terrible sadness,''
President Bush said in Washington. ``I will take this opportunity
to express my regrets, especially to the families of the kids that
were killed.''
   A complement of 74 sailors normally man the massive turret,
which is seven stories tall and weighs 1,800 tons, as much as a
World War II destroyer, said Capt. Larry Seaquist, a former
commander of the Iowa who spoke to reporters at the Pentagon this
morning.
   Burnett said the explosion and fire were confined to the turret,
which is encased in 17-inch-thick steel armor on the sides and
7\-inch armor on the top. Several forward powder magazines were
flooded by crewmen to prevent a second explosion.
   The USS Iowa was one of 29 U.S. ships participating in a
three-week training exercise to test fleet readiness, which began
April 13.
   The Iowa was commissioned in 1943. Besides its 16-inch guns, the
887-foot Iowa is equipped with 12 five-inch guns and Tomahawk and
Harpoon missiles. The Navy, in accordance with policy, declined to
confirm or deny whether any nuclear weapons were aboard.
   The 58,000-ton warship is one of the biggest in the world,
dwarfed only by the Japanese World War II battleships Yamato and
Musashi, each at 72,000 tons.

   For the relatives of the USS Iowa's crew,
agony was not knowing their loved ones' fates, though some gained
strength from each other at the ship's home base, a chaplain said.
   About 200 relatives spent Wednesday night in a Norfolk Naval
Station gym, knowing that 47 of the 1,600 crewmen died when a blast
Wednesday ripped through one of the Norfolk-based battleship's
three-gun turrets.
   ``There is a lot of support within the group. I saw
relationships develop right before my eyes, as women would put
their arms around those who were having troubles,'' Navy Chaplain
Barry Brimhall said Wednesday night.
   Rear Adm. Jimmy Pappas, commander of the Norfolk Naval base,
said early this afternoon that a memorial service for the sailors
killed on the USS Iowa will be held at the base Monday.
   The victims included one officer and 46 enlisted men, he said,
and 12 of the dead are from the Hampton Roads area in Virginia.
   ``Its the greatest tragedy any of us can suffer,'' Pappas said.
   The commander spent most of the night in the base gym waiting
for identification of victims with family members.
   ``Its the most difficult thing you have to do,'' to tell someone
who has lost a relative, he said. Those who found out a relative
survived the tragedy were ``overjoyed with tears'' he said.
   Journalists were kept away from the gym at the families' request.
   Most of the relatives left the gym by daybreak, having heard
about the fate of their own loved ones, said Master Chief Petty
Officer Billy Kinder, a spokesman for the base. The Navy continued
to notify other relatives across the country.
   By Navy policy, relatives are notified in person when a loved
one dies.
   In Temple, Texas, Lorene Barron said all she could do was pray
for her son, Monte Barron, and hope she would hear from the Navy by
telephone.
   ``They told me if he was among the deceased, they would
personally visit us,'' Mrs. Barron said. ``But I believe
everything's going to be OK. And I'm praying for all the mothers
who are waiting just like I am.''
   In Columbus, Ga., the father of Bruce Morgan Jr., said that
waiting to learn his son's fate ``is hell.''
   Bruce Morgan Sr. said his 19-year-old son had told the family he
was to be assigned to a gun crew on the Iowa in March.
   ``There are those who are really struggling, and those who are
really stoic,'' Brimhall said. ``Right now, for some of these
families, they would rather have bad news than no news at all.''
   As the families waited in the gymnasium, area residents swamped
Navy Family Services with offers of help. The area is home to the
world's largest naval facility and many military retirees, and its
economy depends heavily on the military.
   ``It's been fantastic how everyone has pulled together _ both
civilian and military,'' said Cathy Stokoe, deputy director of
family services on the base.
   The Navy has a contingency plan for such disasters and it starts
with taking care of the families, said Kinder.
   ``The first thing we did was establish a place for them to
gather. We provide a place for them to be. The chaplains, social
workers, Red Cross and others are there to help them in anyway
possible,'' he said.
   Ms. Stokoe said merchants brought groceries to the families.
   ``Local stores are providing baby food and diapers at the gym,
and lots and lots of food,'' she said. ``The Red Cross has pulled
out all the stops. There are cots and blankets for those family
members who are staying the night.''
   Kinder said that the families are updated frequently on news
from the ship.
   Officials said the surviving members of the crew had no serious
injuries.
   Brimhall and his colleagues offer what he calls a ``ministry of
presence'' for the families. He said the primary purpose is to let
the families know they have someone to talk to and to reassure them.
   But, Brimhall said, he still must be honest with them.
   ``Some are going to lose a loved one,'' he said.

<HEAD>Oil Spill Threatens Coast of Greek Island</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Efforts were under way to keep a giant oil
slick, apparently caused by a passing ship, from reaching the
shores of an island in southern Greece, the Ministry of Merchant
Marine said Thursday.
   Pools of oil and tar about 200 yards wide were spread along
seven to eight miles off Kithira island, said spokesman Kostas
Stamatis.
   The oil slick was discovered Tuesday, and officials hired three
ships to contain and dissolve the oil with chemicals, Stamatis
said. In addition, dozens of volunteers in small boats were helping
out.
   Sea currents were bringing some of the oil to the eastern part
of Kithira, he added.
   The coast guard, supported by the local authorities and
volunteers, was rushing to clean up the polluted area before it
spread further, he said.
   ``We think that a passing ship might be responsible for the
spill, but the ministry is still investigating the cause,'' said
Stamatis.

   A Soviet oil-skimmer joined the battle
today to clean crude-blackened Alaska waters just six months after
a similar superpower cooperative effort helped free two whales
trapped in ice.
   Soviet Capt. Serge Rekin piloted the ultramodern oil-skimmer
Vaidogubsky toward the mouth of Resurrection Bay on the Gulf of
Alaska to help in the cleanup of the gooey sludge left by the wreck
of the Exxon Valdez. Last October, the icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev
smashed through ice near Barrow, helping to free California gray
whales.
   ``We really appreciated your being here, captain,'' Exxon
spokesman Don Cornett told Rekin through an interpreter on
Wednesday. ``This is the second time people from your country have
come to the aid of the people of Alaska, and we thank you.''
   Rekin said he had little information about the task he faced but
that he wanted to begin work as quickly as possible. The 425-foot
Soviet skimmer is far bigger than any of the 20 or so skimmers that
Exxon has used so far.
   As immigration and customs officials worked Wednesday to approve
the vessel, children on the dock happily swapped candy with Soviet
crew members. Jackie Phillips and a few of her friends stretched on
tiptoes to hand cookies to the Soviets. ``It's just a friendly
gesture,'' she said.
   Officials are hoping the Vaidogubsky can vacuum up much of the
10.1 million gallons of crude oil dumped into Prince William Sound
on March 24, when the Exxon Valdez slammed aground on Bligh Reef
outside Valdez.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan arrived in Anchorage on
Wednesday, and left this morning for the spill site. From an
airplane, he planned to review oil-sodden beaches, blackened rocks
and dying birds and animals in what once was one of the nation's
most untarnished wild areas.
   The Vaidogubsky, because it is designed to work on the high
seas, will be working initially on the gulf rather than the more
sheltered waters of the sound.
   Ribbons of oil have traveled 300 miles along Alaska's coast,
including into spectacularly scenic Resurrection Bay, where oil has
washed up on a beach at Seward.
   Now the oil in the water is thickening and becoming more
difficult to work with. Two Coast Guard skimmers were knocked out
of action when the sludge fouled up their pumps.
   ``We don't know how it's going to work in this oil, the kind of
oil we've been skimming,'' said Coast Guard Capt. Rene Roussel.
This will be first time the ship actually has worked on an oil
spill, said Jim Kross, an environmental consultant hired to arrange
for the ship's services.
   The Vaidogubsky will ply Alaska's waters for at least 30 days.
Exxon will pay for its services, estimated at $15,000 a day, plus
expenses, said James Kross, whose company works for VECO, Exxon's
contractor.
   ``Fifteen thousand a day _ that's not much if it's effective,''
said Cornett.
   The 3-year-old Soviet vessel is a dredge, firefighting platform
and oil skimmer, Kross said. ``It makes its money from dredging.
That's its primary function,'' he said. ``It's a commercial boat.''
   The ship was built in Finland and is stationed at Sahaklin
Island. Its specifications indicate it can skim 200,000 gallons of
crude from the high seas each hour. It has a 2 million-gallon
capacity, and will be accompanied by a barge to take off the oil
when its tanks fills.
   To skim the oil, the vessel swings out a long pole on each side.
An oil-gathering boom is attached to the poles and corrals oil as
the vessel moves through the water, Kross said. Floating suction
pumps are lowered into the captured oil and it is sucked into the
vessel's tanks.
   Jim Simpson, assistant to Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost, said
Congress has been reluctant to pay for such a ship that might be
used only once every 20 years.
   ``I would suspect that after this incident, the answer will be
different,'' he said.
   Seward is named for former Secretary of State William Seward,
the man who bought yet-unexplored Alaska from Russia for $7.2
million in 1867. Doubters dubbed it ``Seward's Folly.''

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference with a group of reporters Thursday.
   Bush: Fire away.
   Q. Mr. President, what are you going to do about the fact that
sensitive and relevant documents were not reviewed by the
Iran-Contra committee?
   A. In the first place, I have great confidence that A.B.
Culvahouse and those charged with cooperating with Congress were
cooperative.
   I've seen nothing to indicate they weren't.
   Secondly, I would offer full cooperation for any requests made
of this administration.
   And I just can't confirm the hypothesis of your question at all.
   Q. But you mean, you would turn over any documents that they now
want to see? Is that what you're saying?
   A. Well, procedures were set up to determine what documents
would be made available.
   Those procedures were agreed to by the Congress.
   And certainly I would see that if any documents are in control
of this administration, relevant documents, that we would live
assiduously by those guidelines.
   So I _ but I have no reason to believe that the previous
administration, the lawyers in it who worked closely with Congress,
did not fulfill their obligations.
   Q. Well, Mr. President, were you an emissary to Honduras, as has
been alleged?
   A. I went to Honduras, sure.
   It's a matter of public record.
   Q. And did you _ (inaudible) _ a quid pro quo deal?
   A. I told you that I'm not going to discuss that until the trial
with North is over.
   And _
   Q. But the jury is being sequestered today _
   A. Well, then I might have something to say on it when the trial
is over.
   But I would simply ask you to understand that this is a request
of the lawyers, and I'm not going to do something that
inadvertently will _ but put it this way: My conscience is clear.
   Q. Well, there have been suggestions that on the documents that
there might have been an oversight either on the part of the FBI,
the part of the White House staff. As far as you can tell, was
there an oversight by any of those two bodies, or _
   A. Not that I know of, Norm.
   Q. _ was it just a question of Congress is not pushing the right
buttons to get _
   A. Well, I'm not sure.
   I don't know.
   All I can just state is the confidence that I feel in Culvahouse
and company.
   But we've received the letter down here, and I will a take this
opportunity to tell them, we'll cooperate fully.
   But who controls the documents and all of that, you'll have to
talk to the lawyers about that.
   Q. Mr. President _
   Q. Mr. President, when you _
   A. I think they're in the control and custody of the archives _
archivist; but I'm not sure.

   Riot troops ringed the house where Adolf
Hitler was born and police said they arrested eight people Thursday
for marking the 100th anniversary of the dictator's birth with Nazi
slogans and stiff-armed salutes.
   Hundreds of police swarmed this city of 17,000 people to prevent
a repeat of the 1979 clashes between neo-Nazis and leftists that
marked Hitler's 90th birthday. No serious incidents were reported.
   Across the border in West Germany, foreigners closed their
stores and kept children out of schools because of fears of
neo-Nazi violence. Several members of anti-Nazi vigilante groups
were arrested for carrying weapons.
   Security was heaviest here, at the two-story yellow house where
Hitler was born on April 20, 1889. The house, a former inn now used
as a day-care center for handicapped children, was sealed off with
metal barriers manned by dozens of police and special riot squads
with dogs.
   About 50 to 100 onlookers stood nearby. Nearly all shops along
the street were closed, some barricaded with wooden boards.
   Police said unspecified numbers of people were being turned back
at the border by West German or Austrian border police.
   A police spokesman said two Austrians, three Italians, two West
Germans and an American were arrested and face fines of up to
$2,300 for their public behavior.
   The Italians, one Austrian and the American gave the Nazi
salute, said a police official who did not give his name. One West
German was arrested after he shouted Nazi slogans and spat at
reporters. Police said he was carrying a large knife.
   Another West German also shouted anti-Semitic slogans, including
``Jew, go and rot!'' and ``This will be a national holiday in 100
years' time!''
   Officials did not identify those arrested. They were charged
with misdemeanors.
   On Wednesday, four Americans, an Irishman and a West German were
ordered by police to change their black boots and brown shirts,
garb reminiscent of Nazi uniforms, police said.
   ``Judging by what could have happened today, I am happy with the
security measures taken,'' Braunau Mayor Gerhard Skiba said.
   Skiba defended an anti-fascist memorial he ordered put up in
front of the ``Hitler House'' two weeks ago.
   ``I did not ask the city council, because I knew that the
(right-wing) Freedom party and part of the (conservative) Austrian
People's party were against it,'' he said.
   The memorial is made of granite from the quarry once worked by
prisoners at the nearby Nazi concentration camp of Mauthausen.
``For peace, freedom and democracy ... Never again fascism,
millions of dead warn,'' reads the inscription.
   Braunau was quiet, but at least four elderly people attracted
clusters of people as they glorified the Nazi past.
   ``The first and second world wars were started because Germany
was economically strong, too strong, and neither East nor West
wanted such an economic power,'' said one.
   In West Berlin, police arrested nine people who were driving
around in cars, apparently to defend against anti-Nazi attacks.
Police said they were carrying tear-gas pistols, helmets, clubs,
knives and other weapons.
   West Berlin police also said a Turkish cemetery was vandalized
early Thursday, with more than 38 grave stones were overturned or
damaged.
   Peter Frisch, vice-president of the Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution in Frankfurt, said foreigners,
particularly Turks, are most vulnerable to attacks.
   Turks in recent years have flocked to West Germany in search of
jobs, triggering resentment among many working-class Germans.
   ``They (the Turks) have assumed the role that the Jews played in
the Nazi ideology,'' Frisch said on the North German radio station.
   In Hamburg districts that have large foreign populations, a
``considerable number'' of parents kept their children out of
schools,'' a school spokesman said.
   Neo-Nazi leaflets circulating in Hamburg recently threatened
violence against foreign schoolchildren.
   Some foreign shopowners closed their stores Thursday in Hamburg.
   In Oslo, Norway, the Dagbladet newspaper marked the day by
publishing a survey that asked 50 children what they knew about
Hitler.
   All said he started World War II, occupied Norway and other
countries for five years, killed millions of Jews and committed
suicide when losing the war.
   ``He was an evil man and probably insane,'' one youngster wrote.

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Activists Dump Letters at Justice Department</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion rights activists dumped some 200,000
letters at the Justice Department on Thursday urging Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh to drop his attempt to have the Supreme
Court's landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion overturned.
   ``This has for the last 15 years been a legal struggle,'' ACLU
executive director Ira Glasser said at a news conference outside
the department where he was surrounded by the mailbags. ``It has
now become a political struggle.''
   The campaign to persuade the court not to reverse the 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision concerns a Missouri case known as Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services. The Justice Department, which
requested and received permission to file a brief in the case, has
asked the court not only to uphold a restrictive Missouri abortion
law but also to upend the 1973 decision.
   The letters to Thornburgh are among the many public expressions
on both sides of the issue. The National Right to Life Committee
plans to run four-page inserts in newspapers around the country
starting next Tuesday. More than 300,000 pro-choice demonstrators
marched on Washington on April 9. And Americans in record numbers
have been writing and telephoning the Supreme Court, which hears
arguments in the Webster case on April 26.
   However, a court spokeswoman, Toni House, said earlier this
week, ``While people have a right to write to the court, I hope
they do not expect that the enunciation of their opinion will have
any effect on the justices.''
   Dave Runkel, Thornburgh's spokesman, said the department would
accept the letters, although he doubted they would change the
anti-abortion views held by Thornburgh and President Bush.
   ``The attorney general believes that everyone has a right to
petition the government,'' he said.
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., who helped Glasser and actor Ed
Asner unload the mailbags from a pickup truck, said the Justice
Department should not be party to the arguments against a woman's
right to have an abortion.
   ``Traditionally, the federal government has been leading the
charge for constitutional rights,'' she said. ``... To see them
stepping backward and snuffing that torch is very distressing.''
   Said Asner: ``George Bush stated that he had thought long and
hard on the serious subject of abortion.... Every person in this
country should be allowed the same freedom he had.''
   Asner said he flew to Washington from his Los Angeles home just
for the mail delivery because ``I think it's important for the
country.
   ``God knows I have my own history with abortion,'' he said,
explaining only, ``I've been involved with abortion as a youth. I
know too many people who were involved when it was illegal and when
it's legal, and, believe me, legal is better.''
   Mrs. Schroeder said the letters, which came in response to ads
placed in newspapers nationwide by the ACLU, have been ``one of the
most phenomenal responses anyone has seen.''
   ``People have been like Rip Van Winkle in the 1980s,'' she said.
``They suddenly woke up.''
   About 8,000 people wrote personal letters, but most were simply
clippings from the ads, many with personal notes attached, the ACLU
said.
   Another pro-choice group, the National Abortion Rights Action
League, began running television, radio and newspaper ads Wednesday
to build on the energy displayed at the abortion-rights march.
   Kate Michelman, executive director of NARAL, said her group's ad
campaign is not intended to lobby the Supreme Court, but she said
the court ``is not immune to the social values and political
environment of the country.''
   The Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services case concerns a
Missouri law that bars use of state funds for abortions and
prohibits public employees from ``encouraging'' or ``performing''
or ``assisting'' an abortion. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected key portions of the law last July 13.
   The Supreme Court could act on the Webster case without touching
Roe vs. Wade, but the Justice Department, in a brief filed in
February, urged the court to overturn the earlier ruling and leave
decisions on abortions to the states.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Sen. J. William Fulbright and
American physicist Amory B. Lovins were among those honored
Thursday with the annual Onassis prizes.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou gave out the awards, totaling
$400,000, at a ceremony in a packed chamber of the former
Parliament building.
   The Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation presents the
prizes to honor international contributions in scholarship, human
rights and the environment.
   The main award, the Athinai prize, went to Fulbright, 84, for
establishing this century's largest international fellowship
program of academic and cultural exchanges.
   ``In the words of your tutor at Oxford, you are `responsible for
the largest and most signifcant movement of scholars across the
face of the earth since the fall of Constantinople in 1453,''' John
Brademas, president of New York University told the Arkansas
Democrat as ministers, diplomats and local dignitaries looked on.
   Fulbright said he hoped the exchange progam he founded more than
40 years ago could play a role in ``enhancing mutual
understanding'' between countries.
   ``Through the international exchange program, I hope the young
people of the world will learn from one another ... if the outlook
for peace is as good as I think and pray it is, then these young
people will have the sort of world and future they are intended to
have,'' Fulbright said.
   Lovins, who in 1982 founded the Colorado Rocky Mountain
Institute that explores energy, water, agricultural security and
economic development, received the $100,000 Delphi Prize for Man
and His Environment.
   ``As Delphi is the navel of the ancient world, so energy is in a
sense the navel of modern society ... rediscovering our solar
rootstock, and grafting modern efficiency technologies onto it,
offers good news for all people and for the Earth,'' said Lovins,
41.
   Soviet professor Boris Piotrovsky, director of the
Leningrad-based Hermitage Museum, picked up the $100,000 Olympia
Prize for Man and Culture.
   The museum was honored for its discovery of several ancient
Greek cities along the Black Sea coast in its more than 150 years
of investigating the area.
   ``This award strengthens the bonds and cooperation that exist
between Soviet and Greek scientists involved in the history of the
ancient world,'' Piotrovsky said.
   The Aristotelis Prize for Man and Society went to both the
Hellenic Spanish Dictionary and Dame Cicely Saunders, who
established the London-based St. Christopher's Hospice for the
terminally ill in 1961.
   The Spanish Hellenic Dictionary was honored for its contribution
to the study and understanding of ancient Greek. Spanish professor
Francisco Rodriguez Adrados accepted the award.
   The Onassis Foundation was set up in 1975 by the estate of the
late Greek shipping magnate Aristotle S. Onassis in memory of his
only son, who was killed in a plane crash in 1973.
   Until November 1988, the philanthropic organization was headed
by Onassis' daughter, Christina. Ms. Onassis, 37, died Nov. 19 of
an apparent heart attack in Argentina.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-seven House members have asked President
Bush to reappoint Dorcas Hardy as Social Security commissioner ``to
maintain a sense of stability in this critical program.''
   Hardy has not been told whether she will be retained by Bush,
but sources in the administration and on Capitol Hill said last
week that the president is seriously considering replacing her.
   A letter supporting Hardy was circulated among House members by
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., and sent to Bush last week. It was
signed by 45 Republicans and two Democrats, including Rep. Andy
Jacobs, D-Ind., chairman of the House Ways and Means Social
Security subcommittee, said Hank Price, a spokesman for Boehlert.
   The lawmakers praised Hardy's initiatives in using toll-free 800
numbers to get information to recipients and in distributing
earnings and benefit estimate statements to participants.
   The legislators that ``there are other service improvements and
initiatives in the works that we don't want to see slowed or
halted, as would inevitably be the case with a change at the Social
Security's helm.''
   ``In view of the need to maintain a sense of stability in this
critical program, as well as the opportunity to continue moving
boldly into the future, we ask that she be given the opportunity to
continue her fine work,'' the letter concluded.
   Hardy had no comment on the letter, said Social Security
spokesman Phil Gambino.
   Hardy, who was named to head the Social Security Administration
in 1986 by then-President Reagan, has been criticized recently by
members of Congress who say people calling the toll-free numbers
often get only busy signals. The critics also say the plan has
required transferring staff from field offices to handle such
calls, leaving offices shorthanded.
   A House Governmental Operations subcommittee wants to look at
Hardy's travel records to see whether she combined business trips
with vacations. Last December, House Democrats charged she had
failed to implement a law requiring the administration to help
homeless people receive benefit checks.
   Bush is considering replacing Hardy with Gwendolyn King, a
former legislative aide to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., who later headed
the Washington office of Dick Thornburgh when Thornburgh, now the
attorney general, was governor of Pennsylvania, according to
administration and Capitol Hill sources who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   King has declined to discuss the Social Security post, but last
week said, ``I will be pleased to serve wherever the president
needs me.''

   I can't go that far, because we really haven't gotten that far

   A. No.
   The Teeter poll _ and I'm not sure it's just because the
committee paid for it _ is much stronger.
   Q. Higher rating? (Laughter.)
   A. Higher, higher, higher.
   I'm not _ I don't want this to be considered a vicious assault
on CBS.
   They're entitled to their polling figures, but the others were _
look, these things _ you know me on polls, John.
   You've heard me on this subject before, and I haven't changed my
view.
   It's not a question of polls but a question of what's going on.
   Are you achieving what you're trying to do?
   And we're making some progress here.
   I was very pleased that the Senate did what it did on the
savings and loan bill, pleased that we got a budget agreement that
many cynics thought we could never achieve at all, no matter how _
of what scope whatsoever.
   That took place.
   And so I think _ I've been very pleased with the recent talks on
the Middle East with three leaders there.
   And so things are moving, but I don't feel under any pressure to
meet somebody else's standard on what is progress or not.
   I know what I'm doing, and I think the country _ I think one
thing is, the country senses that.
   Otherwise, there wouldn't be that kind of support.
   Q. Mr. President, is there something coming up on military aid
to the non-communist resistance in Cambodia?
   A. No.
   No discussion of that yet _ no decision taken on that yet.
   We continue to support, give good support to the process and
certainly to Sihanouk's efforts.
   Q. You said ``no decision'' or _ (inaudible) _
   A. No decision and not with me _ can't recall, but I'm not
anywhere close to making a decision of that nature.
   Q. We're coming up to the 100-day mark on your presidency,
which, if you look over the past 50 years, every other president,
or almost every other president has come into office in times of
crisis. And crisis has been kind of a stage on which we watch
presidents perform. How would you assess your first 100 days so
far?

   Rangers are dragging and
trucking away roadside carcasses of bison and elk to prevent
clashes between tourists and scavenging grizzly bears.
   About one-fourth of the park's northern herd of 26,000 elk has
died this year, and more animals will die this month and in early
May, Joan Anzelmo, a park spokeswoman, said Thursday.
   The elk and bison are falling victim to a combination of a harsh
winter and lack of forage because of last summer's forest fires,
she said.
   Rangers also are sawing off antlers from elk carcasses to
discourage illegal horn hunting. Horn hunters sell the antlers for
about $7 a pound, for use as jewelry, buttons, cabinet handles,
salt-and-pepper shakers and other items.
   It is illegal to remove natural items from the park, and the
antlers are a valuable source of calcium and other minerals needed
by rodents, Joe Halladay, a Yellowstone National Park naturalist,
said.
   Grizzlies in the Yellowstone area are listed as a threatened
species protected under the federal Endangered Species Act.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez led
officials in a solemn ceremony Thursday as the body of Ambassador
Pedro Manuel Aristegui was returned to Spain from the Middle East.
   Aristegui, 61, was killed Sunday when a mortar round, believed
to have been fired by a Syrian gunner, struck his villa in the
Christian suburb of Hadath during weekend artillery barrages in
Beirut.
   A Spanish air force jet bearing the envoy's body from Larnaca,
Cyprus, landed at Madrid's Barajas airport.
   Gonzalez, Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez and other
officials and stood by at the airport as soldiers rendered military
honors.
   Airmen bore the casket draped with a red and gold Spanish flag
to a nearby hearse. The body will lie in state at the Foreign
Ministry until Friday.
   Ministry officials accompanied the envoy's children, 3-year-old
Diego and 1-year-old Alejandra, who returned from Beirut on the
same plane.
   Burial will be in the northern Basque town of Irun, Aristegui's
birthplace.
   Killed with Aristegui was his father-in-law, Tewfic Youssef
Awwad, a noted Lebanese poet; Awwad's other daughter, Samia; and a
Lebanese bodyguard.
   The ambassador's wife was seriously wounded. Diego suffered
facial cuts and Alejandra was unhurt.
   Aristegui had served as ambassador to Nicaragua from 1977-80.
Before that, he held diplomatic posts in West Germany, the United
States and Argentina.
   Spanish officials have said they have no intention of closing
the nation's embassy in Beirut because of the incident.

   Country singer Lee Greenwood has written
a Canadian version of his song ``God Bless the USA,'' and President
Bush hopes the new tune spreads good will between the countries.
   Greenwood has composed ``God Bless Canada'' using the same music
but different lyrics of his 1985 hit, said spokesman Dan Bradley.
   He has been performing the new song during appearances in Canada
and is negotiating with MCA Records' Canada division to record the
adaptation, possibly with Canadian artists, Bradley said Wednesday.
   ``God Bless the USA'' salutes those who have died defending the
country and cites the pride of the citizens. The Canadian version
substitutes references to American cities and states with
descriptions of Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Montreal and
Winnipeg.
   Bush, a country music fan, encouraged Greenwood to finish the
project when the two spent Easter weekend together at Camp David,
Bradley said. Greenwood sang ``God Bless the USA'' at campaign
stops for Bush last year and performed it at inauguration events.
   Bush said he would like to present a recording of the song to
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney as a goodwill gesture,
Bradley said.

   Bette Davis says she was robbed when she failed
to win an Academy Award for ``Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'' and
blames Joan Crawford, her co-star in the 1962 chiller.
   Miss Crawford, who was not nominated, ``campaigned and asked all
the New York members of the academy to please not vote for me,''
Miss Davis said in an interview to be aired Friday on NBC's
``Today.'' `` She really did, and how foolish could she be. We'd
have made a million more dollars on the film had I won that award.''
   Miss Davis already had won two Oscars by then and the nomination
for ``Baby Jane'' was her 10th. She lost the best-actress award to
Anne Bancroft of ``The Miracle Worker.''
   Miss Davis, 81, who lives in West Hollywood, was in New York for
a tribute Monday by the Film Society of Lincoln Center.
   The actress said that in her nearly six decades in front of the
camera, she got to speak some wonderful lines. She particularly
treasures the moment in ``Cabin in the Cotton,'' a 1932 Southern
melodrama, when she drawled: ``I'd love to kiss you but I just
washed my hair.''

   The judge at Oliver North's trial today began
final proceedings as the jury prepared to deliberate the fate of
the former White House aide on 12 criminal charges stemming from
the Iran-Contra affair.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell was to instruct the jury
on the legal principles it must apply in deciding whether North is
innocent or guilty.
   The court session followed a delay of several hours, apparently
over a news report that two jurors had not admitted involvement in
unrelated court actions in the past.
   One courthouse source said the delay stemmed from a story
broadcast Wednesday night that two jurors and an alternate had
failed to mention prior court proceedings in which they had been
involved. The source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Five alternates have sat with the 12-member jury since opening
statements in North's trial on Feb. 21.
   ABC News reported that two of the panelists, Caswell G.
Hartridge, 61, and Helen G. Lynch, 37, had been named as defendants
in civil litigation involving accidents in the early 1980s.
   Both answered ``no'' on jury questionnaires asking them whether
they had ``ever been involved as a party ... in any court
proceedings (civil or criminal).''
   ABC also reported that the first alternate juror, Joseph L.
Ward, 33, who answered ``no'' to the same question, had been
arrested in 1974 on a charge of sale and possession of narcotics.
He was placed on probation for a year, the network said. He also
was arrested in 1987 on a marijuana possession charge but wasn't
prosecuted, it said.
   In final arguments to the jury Wednesday, defense lawyer Brendan
Sullivan declared that the government ``has not shown criminal
behavior'' by North, concluding: ``I ask you to set him free.''
   But prosecutor John Keker said North has refused to acknowledge
that he did anything wrong even though he openly admits lying to
Congress and shredding evidence. ``It's time for you to do it for
him,'' Keker told the jurors.
   Gesell's jury instructions regarding criminal intent could
determine whether North's defense stands or falls. Defense lawyers
asked the judge to include several instructions favorable to North,
including that following orders in good faith negates criminal
intent.
   Sullivan told the jury that President Reagan used North as ``a
sacrificial lamb'' when he fired the National Security Council aide
on Nov. 25, 1986.
   ``The president was using Ollie North as a scapegoat and threw
him overboard to escape some political heat,'' the defense lawyer
said.
   Keker, with a Shakespearian flourish, dismissed Sullivan's
closing arguments as ``all sound and fury, signifying nothing.'' He
said North clearly committed the criminal acts with which he is
charged.
   Jury instructions could be especially important on the charge
that North obstructed Congress on Aug. 6, 1986, by denying to the
House Intelligence Committee that he was assisting the Nicaraguan
Contras during a congressional ban on U.S. aid to the rebels.
   North testified that he lied to the panel, but said he went to
the meetingagainst his wishes on orders from national security
adviser John Poindexter. Poindexter subsequently sent North a note
saying, ``well done.''
   The defense also is relying on the fact that only sketchy notes
were taken at the meeting and that North was not sworn to tell the
truth during the session.
   ``It's almost like a trap,'' said Sullivan. ``When they don't
like what they hear and after a big investigation, 2{ years later
let's charge Ollie North with lying at the meeting.''
   Jury instructions regarding criminal intent also could be
critical on the charge that North illegally accepted a $13,800
security system from co-defendant Richard Secord.
   The fact that Secord paid for the security system is uncontested.
   ``Ollie North is not a saint,'' Sullivan said in discussing that
count. But he said North had a well-founded fear for his life after
terrorist Abu Nidal targeted him for assassination.
   Sullivan said North ``tried to get some help from the
government'' but was rebuffed.
   ``Isn't there a time in life when friends can still help out?''
asked Sullivan. ``The government wants you to convict Ollie North
for accepting a security gate.''
   North's lawyers asked that the jury be instructed to acquit him
on the count if it finds that he acted under duress.
   Other charges against North are that he lied to Congress in 1985
and the attorney general in November 1986, destroyed documents,
converted travelers checks to his own use and conspired to defraud
the U.S. Treasury.
   He faces a maximum 60 years in prison and $3 million in fines if
convicted on all counts.

   India failed to launch its first
intermediate-range ballistic missile Thursday after the ignition
system of the 7{-ton rocket developed a last-minute technical
hitch, military sources said.
   The Agni missile, with a range of 1,550 miles, was scheduled to
be launched from a remote seaside site in the eastern state of
Orissa, where villagers were angered because they had to be
evacuated from their homes.
   ``We had to postpone the launch at the last stage,'' said a
senior military official at the Chandipur launch site, 745 miles
southeast of New Delhi. ``The countdown had started but the
computer reading showed a snag in the ignition system. So we had to
postpone the launching.''
   Another military official said the postponement ``came as a
shock.''
   ``We were depending on the scientists but at the last minute we
were told that the launching would have been disastrous,'' he said.
   Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They said more than 200 scientists would work on the ignition
system to prepare for a launch Friday.
   ``The Agni is a demon,'' said Sarala Das, who said she would
blow a conch shell during the launch. ``We do not want a demon to
be anywhere near us.''
   Hindus believe the sound of a conch shell can drive out evil
spirits.
   Villagers residing within a half-mile radius of the launch site
said they were forcibly evacuated before the scheduled launch.
   ``Police came to our house at dawn and told us to get out,''
said Sideshwar Jana, a 40-year-old farmer. He said he did not want
to leave his home but was forced out after police threatened to
arrest him and his relatives.
   About 400 villagers, leading their goats and carrying their
chickens, walked to a relief center they had set up, ignoring a
government camp that offered free food and movies.
   Late Thursday evening, dozens of policemen visited the area to
ensure it was evacuated.
   Arun Dey, a former legislator spearheading protests of the
launch, said he feared the villagers would react violently if they
weren't allowed to return home at night.
   ``For a villager not to be in his home is like a turtle out of
water,'' Dey said. ``A fish out of water is dead but a turtle out
of water is confused and lost.''
   A successful launch of the missile, named ``Agni'' or ``Fire,''
will rank India along with the United States, the Soviet Union,
Britain, France and China in ballistic missile capabilities. It
also will enhance the power of India's 1.36 million army and its
geo-political influence in the region, military experts say.
   Since April 1987, India has successfully tested three types of
surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, with ranges varying
from 5{ miles to 155 miles.
   Military test-firing is nothing new in Chandipur, where the
colonial British set up an arms and ammunition test range 95 years
ago. The area was chosen because of a rare geographical phenomenon:
during low tide water recedes by two miles, which helps to retrieve
the fired shells.

   Jordan's King Hussein offered qualified
support today for an Israeli proposal for Palestinian elections in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a first step toward ending the
Arab-Israeli impasse.
   After two hours of talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker,
Hussein told reporters at the State Department the idea of an
election ``might be worth looking at'' in the context of a
comprehensive peace process.
   He added that elections cannot be an end in themselves.
   Hussein's carefully chosen words appeared to be his most
positive statement about the Israeli proposal since it was outlined
here two weeks ago during a visit by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Shamir proposed that Palestinians elect ``interlocutors'' to
represent them in negotiations with Israel for limited
self-government.
   Hussein said he was optimistic about the prospects for peace, a
sentiment he shared at a White House dinner Wednesday night with
Baker, President Bush and National Security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   ``I think there is a better chance for peace,'' Hussein told
reporters after a sumptuous dinner of salmon, duckling and other
delicacies.
   Moments earlier, Bush said in a toast to his guest: ``We can
sense an urgency to the quest for peace now. Our task is to use
that urgency to seize the moment.''
   In his toast, Hussein pleased his hosts by pledging to cooperate
closely with the United States to achieve a ``just, durable and
comprehensive peace settlement.''
   ``We will support you in all your endeavors to achieve a
comprehensive just and lasting peace,'' he told Bush.
   Because of Jordan's proximity to the West Bank, the
administration regards Hussein's support for any peace process as
essential for its success.
   Administration officials seemed pleased with Hussein's backing.
He had seemed content to play a more peripheral role in Middle East
diplomacy last summer when he severed Jordan's ties with West Bank
Palestinians.
   Baker said that the ``beginning of a process'' is under way as a
result of the talks with Hussein and earlier visits here by both
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
   ``It is important to do what he can to advance that process,''
Baker said.
   Shamir's election proposal is the newest element in the process,
and Baker left the clear impression that the administration has
carefully examined the kinds of issues that such an arrangement
would entail.
   Left unanswered thus far, he said, are such questions as who
would supervise elections in the territories, who would be entitled
to vote and would voting rights be extended to Palestinians living
outside the two areas.
   Although Hussein did not give an outright endorsement to the
proposal for elections, Baker said he was pleased with the
responses of both Hussein and Mubarak to Shamir's proposal.
   Scowcroft, also present at the dinner, said, ``We have come a
long way.''

   A. It could.
   It might.
   But I think Gorbachev, on the Soviet _ East-West relations,
understands what we're about.
   I frankly thought that what we said on Poland the other day was
a new and a strong initiative.
   But that takes time to sort out these things.
   But I didn't do it because I wanted to get in under the 100-day
wire.
   Now, the question is _ we've spelled out what we want to do, and
now, we've got to move our bureaucracy to see that we do it.
   And, you know, it's that _ it's the kind of concept on the
Middle East.
   Spent a lot of time on the Middle East, and I think King Hussein
was right when he said yesterday that the time is right for some
kind of action.
   But now we've got to assess, after he leaves here, where we go
and what next step we take.
   We've got something out there on elections that offers some
promise.
   We haven't backed away from historic positions on conference, or
whatever.
   And so we move, we take whatever the next step is.
   I wish I could give you a more dramatic answer to the Lebanon,
because this is one that really does hurt.
   And I'm very, very concerned about it.
   And here, all I can say to you is that we have encouraged the
secretary general to go forward, to try this mission of peace.
   There's some stumbling blocks to that, I'm told.
   We will renew our call for removal of all foreign troops and for
a cease-fire.
   But here is one where I wish I had a _ that there was some
dramatic plan in which the players in the area could agree to, and
it's not there.
   And we've talked to the Middle Eastern leaders.
   But I cite this one because I really feel it about the Lebanon
and Lebanon's _ the divisions in Lebanon.
   We've talked to the Brits about it; we've talked to the French
about it, and Mitterrand the other day; and people at the U.N. are
trying to figure.
   But there is not a dramatic plan that can bring peace to Lebanon
right now.
   Q. Is that a problem that defies solution?
   A. It's a problem _ the short-run of it, how you stop this
firing, the shelling; how you get factions to stop warring, has,
certainly in recent times, defied solution.

   We simply are not going to _
   Q. How does the U.S. manage to provide any kind of influence
with this _
   A. Well, that's the problem.
   We don't have great influence in Lebanon with the factions that
are fighting.
   We do have good influence with many of the countries out there.
   In fact, I think our standing with the moderate Arab countries
is as good today as any time in recent history.
   And I feel strongly about that.
   And back to the Martin Van Buren theory, I mean, we're building,
still, coming back out of a time that hit a bit of a low on _ three
or four years ago.
   Then we restored some prestige by the way we acted in the gulf.
   Then you see a cease-fire in the gulf.

<HEAD>Brezhnev Son-in-Law in Soft Labor Camp, But No Adidas Allowed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son-in-law of the late Soviet President Leonid
I. Brezhnev is serving his bribery sentence by lounging around a
prison camp hospital, a newspaper reported.
   But the warden put his foot down when former deputy Interior
Minister Yuri Churbanov indicated his idea of a prison uniform was
an Adidas warm-up suit, according to Wednesday's editions of the
newspaper Socialist Industry.
   Churbanov was convicted in December of taking bribes to protect
a huge ring of corrupt officials in Uzbekistan. The prosecutor said
in his trial that Churbanov married Brezhnev's daughter, Galina, to
ensure his rise in the Interior Ministry, which controls the police.
   Churbanov is serving his 12-year sentence in a special camp for
former high officials, KGB officers and policemen where ``there are
about as many products in the camp's store as in the city's,'' the
newspaper said. That is a particularly telling point for Soviet
readers, who complain that shop shelves are empty.
   The newspaper said Churbanov has not worked a single day in the
six weeks since his arrival at the labor camp in Nizhny Tagil in
the Ural Mountains 870 miles east of Moscow.
   A radiologist said he found a spot on Churbanov's lung that
could mean tuberculosis, so the former deputy interior minister has
been medically excused from work ``where there is gas or dust,''
the newspaper said. He probably will get a job in the library or
kitchen, it said.
   For now, he is occupying a private room in the prison infirmary.
   Despite Churbanov's privileges, however, the camp chief denied
his request to be allowed to keep his training suit ``in order to
have something to wear to the doctor's.''
   ``It was necessary to explain to the prisoner, that in a
reinforced regime colony, Adidas is hardly appropriate,'' said
Socialist Industry.

<HEAD>Trade Rep Says Months of Work Needed on Liberalizing Trade Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills told
Congress on Thursday that the Bush administration had achieved a
breakthrough in worldwide trade liberalization talks but that
months of hard bargaining remained to guarantee ultimate success.
   ``I am delighted to report to you that the Uruguay Round
negotiations are advancing once again,'' she told the Senate
Finance Committee, adding at another point, ``We are now well
positioned to undertake in earnest the final, hard bargaining which
will determine whether the Uruguay Round succeeds.''
   Mrs. Hills appeared to be referring to agreements earlier this
month in Geneva that broke a four-month deadlock in trade
negotiations with 100 other countries that are being held under the
auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The talks, known as the Uruguay Round, had been in danger of
collapsing after a meeting last December in Montreal because of a
failure to reach compromises in four key areas, including a U.S.
demand to end all trade-distorting farm subsidies.
   The United States agreed to compromise language in the
agricultural area, paving the way for compromises on the other
disputed issues.
   In addition to agriculture, the talks had been deadlocked over
the issues of trade in textiles, ways to protect patented products
from piracy and setting limits on the use of temporary trade
restrictions to protect industries hurt by surges in imports.
   Mrs. Hills said the United States was satisfied that the
language adopted in Geneva in all of these areas set the stage for
a successful completition of the negotiations, which are aimed at
opening up markets for the freer flow of trade between countries.
   Of particular concern to the United States is a landmark
proposal included in the discussions that would for the first time
establish rules for free trade in service industries, such as
banking, engineering, insurance and communications. Supporters hope
that agreement in the service field, where the United States has
long excelled, will help to lower America's huge foreign trade
deficits.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the committee chairman, asked Mrs. Hills
whether she believed the remaining 20 months was enough time to
complete the talks, given the wide range of topics to be settled.
   ``The question of further delays in the negotiations is a
serious concern,'' he said. ``Even if all participants were eager
to reach agreement, the hard bargaining over substance is only just
now beginning.''
   Mrs. Hills said that she believed that the discussions would end
on time even though past GATT rounds have been extended for up to
four years.
   ``We have an ambitious agenda, and it is important, given other
initiatives underway, that the Uruguay Round be concluded by
December 1990, as agreed,'' she said.

   About 40 high school students were
suspended after a sit-in to protest a rule that prohibits hugging
and kissing on school property, administrators said.
   The Pavillion Central School students will not be allowed to
return until they agree, during a visit to the school with their
parents, to obey the rule, said Principal Larry Graham.
   The suspended students were part of a group of 65 students who
left the school Wednesday morning to protest enforcement of a
3-year-old Student Council-approved code of discipline that forbids
``overt displays of affection beyond handholding.''
   Graham said the crackdown came in response to an increasing
number of students hugging and kissing in the halls. The behavior
had become an embarrassment to faculty and other students, he said.
   The protesters complained they would not be allowed to hug each
other after a sports victory or in times of grief. Graham said the
rule does not apply in those cases. Students violating the rule
receive detention.

   We have a, I think, much better communication now with Jordan.

So, Terry, this is going to be the last one or two questions.

arsenal, to go with MX, Midgetman. And you said Cheney gave you
some recommendations this week and a decision is expected this

he comes back from NATO.
   But no decision has been taken.
   Q. (Inaudible.)
   A. Well, can't tell you that.
   I'm listening because this exercise yesterday in this Cabinet

   But I wanted to get their input.

   The national security adviser has provided me with a lot of

   We've had several important briefings on it, and I will be

   On the table is the election process, and one of the things
would be how we flesh that out, taking into consideration the
concerns about it that have been expressed by Mubarak and by King
Hussein and also by Mr. Shamir.
   So how we do that, what the modalities are of that, will be _ a
lot of thought will be going into that, who's represented, making
clear that this isn't a final step, that that isn't going to solve
the Middle East problem, making clear that it's a step, that we

<HEAD>NATO Ministers Give Mild Backing to Modernization Plan; Cheney Satisfied</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers Thursday gave
only limited support to an American plan to upgrade nuclear arms in
Europe, again putting off tough decisions on the politically
charged issue.
   But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was satisfied with the
endorsement by ministers attending a two-day nuclear strategy
session of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   He predicted the support, voiced in a carefully crafted
statement, would enable the Defense Department to win congressional
approval for more money to develop the new generation
surface-to-surface missile.
   ``I am reluctant to make hard and fast predictions about what
Congress will or won't require,'' he said on the flight back to
Washington.
   ``But I will take the language that we've got and do the best I
can to garner the necessary support,'' he said. ``And I'm
reasonably confident that that will work.''
   In advance of the meeting, U.S. officials had said privately
they wanted a stronger signal from allies to continue the
development program. But the lukewarm backing was virtually the
same as that given at last fall's nuclear strategy meeting in the
Netherlands.
   The statement said NATO's strategy will continue to require
``for the foreseeable future'' a mix of conventional and nuclear
arms.
   ``At this meeting, we again expressed our determination to
ensure that NATO possesses diversified, survivable and
operationally flexible nuclear forces across the entire spectrum,''
the ministers said.
   ``These forces must be kept up-to-date where necessary,'' they
said.
   George Younger, Britain's secretary of state for defense, said
the statement ``paves the way ... for decisions to be taken as they
become necessary in the future.''
   ``What it hasn't done is to step back in any way from the
general NATO strategy,'' he told reporters.
   President Bush and other NATO leaders will meet May 29-30 in
Brussels to consider, among other things, the Comprehensive
Concept, a blueprint to guide the allies' future strategy for arms
control and force planning.
   NATO officials were expected to spend the weeks leading up to
the summit trying to find language that will bridge the differences
over the modernization question.
   With warming East-West ties, the idea of upgrading the Lance has
become increasingly unpopular, especially in West Germany where
most of the weapons would be based.
   The Lance missile, which was introduced in 1972, will become
obsolete in 1995, military analysts say.
   It has a range of a little more than 60 miles. The upgraded
missile would have a range of about 250 miles.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to delay the decision
on modernization until 1991 or 1992 _ after important elections in
his country.
   ``By 1991 or 1992, obviously, we would hope to have been able to
arrive at specific decisions with respect to what (new nuclear)
systems would be deployed,'' Cheney told a news conference at NATO
headquarters.
   ``We clearly are not there yet. It's not required yet. So for
that reason, I'm comfortable with what we have in this
communique,'' he said.
   Belgium and some other European nations would like the alliance
to enter into early negotiations with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact on
reducing short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   The United States and Britain strongly oppose such a move,
saying emphasis should be placed on current East-West bargaining to
reduce conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in Europe.

<HEAD>New Food Shipments to Rebel-Held Region Planned For Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations will send another
convoy of food to starving masses in southern Sudan, this time
along a different route than the treacherous path traveled by an
earlier convoy, a spokesman said Thursday.
   The convoy will be the second initiated by the United Nations
since launching Operation Lifeline Sudan on April 1. Seven people
died when the first convoy to the rebel-held region was attacked
Tuesday.
   The new 47-truck convoy is to carry 1,100 tons of maize from
Uganda's capital, Kampala, on the two-day trip to the Sudanese city
of Nimule, U.N. spokesman Paul Mitchell said. Nimule is just across
the border from Uganda.
   The relief effort aims to avert 100,000 famine deaths by
stocking more than 110,000 tons of food in southern Sudan before
heavy rains begin in mid-May.
   But the operation has been plagued with delays caused by
political difficulties, bad weather and equipment shortages. U.N.
officials concede they are unlikely to meet their goal before the
rainy season, which lasts through October.
   Mitchell said the United Nations hoped the convoy would leave
Friday, but that delays were possible.
   ``There are so many variables in this part of the world that we
don't like to say until it actually goes,'' said Mitchell.
   He said the northern Ugandan area through which the convoy would
travel is ``somewhat insecure,'' but U.N. officials did not
anticipate any problems.
   The first U.N. convoy carried 110 tons of food and supplies from
the northern Kenyan town of Lokichoggio through the Sudan People's
Liberation Army's rebel base at Kapoeta.
   It was heading to the rebel-held town of Torit when it was
attacked. Seven rebel escorts died and the lead truck in the
14-vehicle convoy was destroyed.
   U.N. officials have suspended the overland route to Torit
indefinitely due to the attack, but say an airlift to the
rebel-held town may begin Friday from the Ugandan city of Entebbe.
   Officials Thursday still had not assessed blame for Tuesday's
attack, but speculation centered on nomadic tribal warriors,
government troops or government militias operating against the
rebel group.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army took up arms against Sudan's
Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum in 1983 seeking greater
autonomy and more economic development for the predominantly
Christian and animist south.

<HEAD>Insurers' Group Asks for `Truce' with Consumer Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trade association of insurance companies
Thursday called for ``a truce in the war of words'' with consumer
groups and cooperation in efforts to reform state auto insurance
laws.
   The Alliance of American Insurers, made up of 107 companies,
suggested 14 ways to change state laws. Some proposals have long
had industry support, such as advocating strict no-fault laws,
while others won endorsement for the first time, such as allowing
customers the choice between no-fault and conventional policies.
   ``We are calling on the consumer groups, with whom we share many
ideals, and the rest of our industry to work with us,'' said
Franklin W. Nutter, president of the alliance. ``What we offer is a
truce in the war of words.''
   Member companies of the alliance write 10 percent to 12 percent
of auto insurance nationwide. The group includes such major
companies as Liberty Mutual and Kemper. Other major auto insurers,
such as GEICO and State Farm, are not members.
   Reaction from consumer groups was reserved.
   ``Where were they a year ago or five years ago, when Ralph Nader
and Clarence Ditlow (head of the Center for Auto Safety) where
fighting in the trenches?'' asked Robert Hunter, header of the
National Insurance Consumer Organization, an advocacy group Nader
helped organize.
   But, Hunter added, ``I have no problem in working together in
things we agree on.''
   Joan Claybrook, director of Public Citizen, an advocacy group
that Nader also helped found, said, ``I think this is a political
reaction to being zapped by Proposition 103 in California,'' to a
successful ballot initiative of last fall, now under court
challenge, that requires auto premium rollbacks.
   Since the industry's desired changes vary from state to state,
Nutter said he could not offer an estimate of cost savings that
could follow from the alliance's program. But, he said, ``We are
fully convinced that these proposals, based on the experience of a
variety of cities,'' where insurance practices were studied, ``will
lower the costs of claims and settlements.''
   The 14 points:
   _No-fault laws with strong restrictions on lawsuits. Such laws
are in effect in Michigan, New York and Florida. Motorists recover
their losses from their own insurers instead of suing the other
motorist involved in a crash.
   _Failing that, allowing buyers to chose between no-fault and
conventional policies.
   _Tightening of uninsured motorist laws.
   _Stronger anti-fraud and anti-theft programs, including possible
inspections of cars before policies are issued.
   _Renewed efforts to reduce repair costs, including restoration
of requirements that bumbers withstand five miles per hour crashes;
insurer referral to cooperating repair shops and continued use of
replacement parts not made by the original manufacturer.
   _An end to double collection of benefits from both auto and
medical insurance policies.
   _Greater involvement by auto insurers in efforts to control
increasing medical costs.
   _Consumer information programs, including possible information
on new-car stickers about the instances of theft, ease of repair
and claim frequencies of similar models.
   _Better organization of ``assigned risk'' pool coverage.
   _More funds for state insurance departments.
   _More involvement by insurers in land use and transportation
planning in urban areas, including support for mass transit.
   _Better law enforcement, including restoration of the 55 mph
speed limit.
   _Better vehicle design, including support for air bags, tougher
standards for side impact and rollover protection and extension of
auto safety standards to light trucks and vans.
   _Opposition to laws limiting competition among insurers.
   On the last point, Nutter said directors of the alliance had
instructed the staff to examine, with agent organizations, such
topics as repealing laws forbidding the sale of group auto
insurance.

   Landslides and flooding struck the mountainous
area of Adzharia in Soviet Georgia this week, killing five people
and leaving another 47 missing and feared dead, state TV said
Thursday.
   About 13,000 people are threatened by flooding rivers, snowmelt
and mudslides aggravated by earth tremors, the news program
``Vremya'' said. Already, 800 families have been evacuated, it
said, and 3,000 others are due to leave in the near future.
   The news show said 52 peoples were caught in a landslide on
Mount Salgan Wednesday which buried four houses and a bus. It said
five bodies have been recovered and rescuers are searching for the
missing 47.
   The Tass news agency had a slightly different version. It said a
mudslide blocked the River Charukh, flooding four homes and a bus
in the village of Tsablana. The news agency said three people died
and four were rescued, but more than 45 others may have been
trapped.

<HEAD>President Announces Special Force to Combat Death Squads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco said Thursday
he is creating a 1,000-man force to wipe out right-wing death
squads run by drug traffickers.
   The death squads have killed about 1,500 people in Colombia in
the last five years. Most victims have been leftist sympathizers.
   Barco announced the new squad in a televised address Wednesday
night and released details Thursday.
   Barco said the squads are threatening democracy and sabotaging
talks between the government and leftist guerrillas.
   ``These groups are not just common criminals,'' Barco said.
``They are real terrorist organizations supported and financed
mainly by drug traffickers.''
   ``The criminal acts are carried on a pretext of anti-communism
and the fight against the guerrillas,'' he said. ``In reality, the
majority of the people who have been victims of these terrorist
acts are not guerrillas.
   ``They are men, women and even children who have not taken up
weapons against the government. They are peaceful Colombians.''
   Colombia asked the United States, Britain, Israel and Italy to
help train anti-terrorist troops, Justice Minister Guillermo Plazas
said last week after a trip to Washington.
   In the last year, death squads have attacked entire villages a
dozen times, shooting at random.
   The worst such attack came Nov. 11 when a death squad firing
submachine guns killed 43 people in the northwest town of Segovia.
   Barco said the special force will draw from all government
security forces and will be directed by the head of the national
police. The national police force is part of the armed forces.
   Barco said he also will create a national commission to take
even more measures to combat the death squads.
   The president said 23 of the estimated 150 death squads in
Colombia have been dismantled and 50 of their gunmen have been
arrested so far this year.
   It was not until after the massacre in Segovia that the
government began to act against the death squads.
   Since then, government reports have shown that the death squads
are run by drug traffickers with the help of cattlemen and other
land owners and policemen and soldiers acting on their own.
   About 30 members of the national police and the army face
charges this year for allegedly helping death squads.

   Q. How do you _ what is the structure _
   A. Well, we have the _ on the U.S. side, we use the National
Security Council procedures to do that.
   And of course, we _ I plan to be in touch with the various
leaders.
   I've told them I want to do that as president, and I do plan to
talk personally with some of the leaders out there on these matters
_
   Q. Is this _
   A. _ in addition to the ones I already talked to.
   For example, I talked to King Faud the other day.
   And I think that that is useful, to be sure now, after this
round of visits, what do they think?
   A lot of these countries can be important players here, and the
more agreement we can get on the next step, the more likely it is
to succeed.
   Last, Lesley.
   Q. Mr. President, on the (USS) Iowa, is it time to say that
50-year-old battleships are in fact obsolete and to begin taking
them out of service? Is that the lesson here, or what's your lesson
on this _
   A. No, that's not _ well, my lesson is that _ to find out what

safety is at the highest point, and _ but not _ I wouldn't jump to
the conclusion that because that kind of powder is put into these
turrets in that way, that that obsolete _ that that makes a useful
platform obsolete.
   I'm not going to go that far.
   Q. Could you indulge me one quick question for the conflict with
_ the attorney general _
   A. Come on, John, give me a break!
   Q. One quickly. The attorney general _
   A. Is this for TV or is this for the print?
   Q. Both. The attorney general suggested yesterday that it might
be appropriate to drug test people in public housing. HUD took
immediate exception to that. What do you think?
   A. I'd have to talk to him about it, because I don't know and
I'm not going to go off on some tangent here until I know exactly
the thinking of our key Cabinet people.
   We've got a good Cabinet system, and I encourage people to speak
out, but the decisions on something of that nature will be made
right here, in that room.
   And they're not going to be made until I have all of the facts.
   Q. Do you expect interest rates to come down now that you've
passed a budget agreement? (Scattered laughter.)
   A. I was very pleased with the market reaction to the budget
agreement.
   It seems to have been underreported.
   But nevertheless, very heartening, Terry.
   Q. How about the interest rates? You said during the campaign _
   A. I'm not heartened by the interest rates. (Scattered laughter.)
   Q. (Inaudible) _ to say about drug testing for the federal
employees?
   A. On selective ways, yes, absolutely.
   Q. Selective like _
   A. Well, we've already got some patterns out there.
   Q. (Inaudible) _ where?
   A. Well, widely.
   If we're talking about drug-free workplace, we've got to have
some testing, and I support that.
   This idea that this is total infringement on everybody, I don't
agree.
   Now in some cases, I mean I don't want it to have _ be so
widespread, but I do think it's _ selective drug testing is very
important and nobody will change my mind on that one.
   Q. Civil rights being lost?

Says</HEAD>

   An asteroid big enough to wipe out cities
whizzed past the Earth last month before astronomers even knew it
was there, showing how hard it is to forecast a natural disaster
from space, a NASA scientist said Thursday.
   The mountain-sized asteroid flashed by the Earth at a speed of
46,000 miles an hour and was not even detected until days after it
had become only a receding point of light, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration announced.
   Astronomers reported that the object missed the Earth by only a
half million miles _ about twice the distance between the Earth and
moon. In cosmic terms, this is considered ``a close call.''
   Had it hit the Earth, said Bevan French, a scientist in NASA's
solar system exploration division, the asteroid would have created
a crater the size of the District of Columbia and spread
destruction for 100 miles in all directions. Other effects would be
felt thousands of miles away, he said.
   ``The object would be packing the equivalent of 40 billion tons
of TNT,'' said French ``That would be equal to about 40,000
hydrogen bombs all going off at the same time.''
   Henry Holt, a retired U.S. Geological Survey scientist now
working on a NASA-funded project to detect and track asteroids that
cross the Earth's orbit, found the asteroid in photographs taken
almost a week after it had flown past.
   French said the fact that the asteroid, called 1989FC, was not
seen earlier comes as no surprise.
   ``These detections are made because you can photograph a trail
of light as it moves against a background of fixed stars,'' said
French. ``That means the asteroid is moving across your path and
not on a collision course.
   ``An asteroid that was heading right for you would look just
like another small fixed star and might be very difficult to detect
until it was too late to do anything about it,'' he said.
   There have been several federally funded studies to determine
how to protect the Earth from being bombed by outer space rocks,
but little else has been done, said French.
   ``Your best bet would be to identify these several hundred or
thousand Earth crossers (asteroids) and calculate their orbit,'' he
said. ``Then you would know when you are in danger.''
   Once the approaching object was sighted, said French, ``then you
could launch a large nuclear device to explode near the asteroid
and nudge it out of the way.''
   But for now, said the NASA scientist, ``we don't really have the
kind of detection capability or launch capability to do that at the
moment.''
   French said Holt found the object in photos taken on March 31 by
an 18-inch telescope at the Mount Palomar Observatory in
California. The photos were processed several days later and the
asteroid was discovered by comparing views taken an hour apart.
   By the time the object was photographed, French said, it had
already made its closest approach to Earth and was streaking
outward, away from the sun. Scientists plotted the trajectory
backward and determined that the asteroid passed within a half
million miles of Earth on March 23.
   ``On the cosmic scale of things, that was a close call,'' Holt
said in the NASA announcement of the event.
   Asteroid 1989FC came closer to Earth than any other object so
large since the pass in 1937 of an object called Hermes. That
object went by Earth at about the same distance as 1989FC.
   French said that if 1989FC had impacted dry land on Earth ``it
would be a very major catastrophe for which we have had no
experience.''
   If the asteroid had hit the ocean, he said, it would have
created tidal waves that would wash over vast areas of coastal
regions.
   French said that there may be ``hundreds to thousands'' of such
Earth-crossing asteroids and that such an object the size of 1989FC
could reasonably be expected to impact the Earth every 5 million to
20 million years.
   He said there is a crater in Ghana and one in the Soviet Union
created by such objects hitting the Earth. The Soviet crater is
thought to be less than a million years old.
   Scientists also believe that an object about six miles in
diameter hit the Earth about 65 million years ago and ejected so
much debris into the atmosphere that it caused the planet to cool.
A popular theory blames this event for the extinction of the
dinosaurs.
   French said that 1989FC is in an orbit that crosses the orbits
of Earth, Mars and Venus. He said the asteroid is moving away from
the sun now, but will pass within 20 million miles of the Earth
early in October.
   Experts now are tracking the asteroid to gain a more refined
estimate of its orbit. French said 1989FC passed close enough to
the Earth for its orbit to be affected by the planet's
gravitational influence. Scientists will have to take this into
account when calculating the asteroid's new orbit.

   Contra leaders Thursday denied delaying the
dismissal of a commander convicted of human rights violations, and
accused the United States of unfairly threatening to cut off aid to
the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The issue arose when the rebels agreed to suspend the head of
Contra intelligence, Jose Benito Bravo Centeno _ known as
Commandante Mack _ after a military tribunal convicted him of
torturing and killing suspected infiltrators from the country's
leftist Sandinista government.
   Mack was supposed to be relieved of duty while appealing the
conviction, but reporters recently saw him at a Contra camp in
Honduras and spotted his car outside the headquarters of the
intelligence unit.
   On Tuesday a spokesman for the State Department warned that the
United States could cut off the Nicaraguan rebels' $50 million aid,
which Congress granted only for non-lethal purposes, if they did
not carry out the sentence as agreed.
   ``I think that's unfair,'' Contra director Roberto Ferrey
responded Thursday at the rebels' Miami headquarters. ``We are
saying that human rights should be respected, and the accused also
has human rights. In the U.S., the accused has the right of appeal
_ there is nothing tricky going on.''
   Ferrey said under Contra procedures, Mack's appeal has to go
before the seven civilian directors. He added that the directorate
was trying to expedite the case, and hoped for a final decision on
Mack's punishment or expulsion by the end of April.
   The director denied Mack was continuing to work while suspended,
but acknowledged he remains at the camp in Honduras.
   ``The person has been separated from his daily duties, but he
can still be at the camp _ he doesn't have anyplace else to go,''
Ferrey said.
   Several members of Congress have made the Mack issue central to
their support for continuing the $50 million aid package signed
Tuesday by President Bush. Under the law, Congress must certify
that the Contras are respecting human rights and honoring truce
agreements reached as part of a Central American peace plan.
   Ferrey said Mack's was the only major human rights violation
case working its way through the Contra appeal procedure.

<HEAD>Rocky Mountain Last, New England First in Per Capita Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rocky Mountain region for the first time
replaced the Southeast at the bottom of the nation's per capita
income scale last year, as its income growth was held back by
weakness in oil and gas exploration, the government reported
Thursday.
   Per capita personal income in the Rocky Mountain states averaged
$14,282 last year, 13 percent below the national average of
$16,444. New England, meanwhile, claimed the top slot for the fifth
straight year, with income of $20,013, 22 percent above the
national average.
   It was the widest gap since 1969 between the highest and lowest
regions, based on per capita income as a percent of the U.S.
average, the Commerce Department reported.
   It also continued the pattern of the nation's six-year-old
economic expansion, in which per capita income has grown faster
than average in the high-income regions and has advanced slower
than average in low-income regions.
   ``The high-income states are still moving further away, above
the U.S. average, and the lower-income states are moving further
away, below the average,'' said Rudolph DePass, a Commerce
Department analyst.
   On a state-by-state basis, Connecticut claimed the top spot for
the third straight year in 1988, with average per capita income of
$22,761, while Mississippi remained in the basement with average
income of $10,992.
   Mississippi has been last in every year for which the Commerce
Department has records, stretching back to 1929, except for 1933,
when South Dakota briefly bumped it out of cellar.
   Last year was the first time the Southeast, with average income
of $14,331, did not rank last among the eight regions. Income
growth in the Southeast matched the national average last year of
6.2 percent, while its replacement on the bottom rung, the Rocky
Mountains, saw income grow by 5.4 percent.
   When the national figures are adjusted for inflation, average
per capita income grew 2 percent last year, up from the 1.4 percent
pace in 1987.
   DePass said the gap between high- and low-income areas has
widened even as income growth slows down in high-income states and
accelerates elsewhere.
   For example, per capita income in New England grew 7.8 in 1988,
down from 8.2 percent in 1987. At the same time, last year's 5.4
pace of growth in the Rocky Mountain states was up from 3.6 percent
in 1987.
   The Commerce Department said growth in the Rocky Mountain states
and in the Southwest, where per capita income of $14,365 was up 5.2
percent in 1988, was held back by slow oil and gas exploration.
   Income growth advanced even more slowly in the Plains states,
where per capita income of $15,495 advanced just 4.8 percent,
reflecting the weak farm economy.
   The growth of per capita income in New England and the Middle
Atlantic regions, meanwhile, was bolstered by rapidly expanding
service and construction payrolls, combined with below-average
population growth.
   Among the top-ranking states, Connecticut was followed by New
Jersey, with per capita income of $21,882; Massachusetts, $20,701;
Alaska, $19,514; and Maryland, $19,314.
   The District of Columbia would have ranked third if it had been
ranked along with the states, with per capita income of $21,667
last year.
   At the other end of the list, Mississippi was followed by West
Virginia, $11,658; Utah, 12,013; Arkansas, $12,172; Louisiana,
$12,193; and South Dakota, $12,475.
   South Dakota and North Dakota were the only states in which per
capita income fell last year, dropping 0.6 percent in the former
and 1.9 percent in the latter to $12,720.

   An investment banker on her regular jog through
Central Park was raped and beaten unconscious by a teen-age gang
that attacked two other people in a late-night crime spree, police
said Thursday.
   The 30-year-old victim was in critical condition at Metropolitan
Hospital after the Wednesday night assault, said Chief of
Detectives Robert Colangelo.
   Two pedestrians found the victim, wearing only a bra and bound
and gagged with a sweatshirt, about 1:30 a.m. She had a fractured
skull and her body temperature was 80 degrees when she was
discovered.
   Colangelo said evidence indicated the woman fought desperately
against at least a dozen assailants.
   Three suspects were in custody. Two others had been arrested and
released before the unconscious woman was discovered, Colangelo
said. Police were searching for up to seven additional suspects,
all ages 13 to 15.
   As many as 20 youths came to the park about 10 p.m. from upper
Manhattan, said Deputy Commissioner Alice McGillion.
   The gang used a pipe to assault and rob a 40-year-old man
carrying his groceries home through the park, Colangelo said.
   Police believe the jogger was attacked next, with several gang
members then assaulting another woman, Colangelo said. The five
suspects were arrested in the attack on the man, said McGillion.

<HEAD>Hussein Backs Palestinian Elections with Conditions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Hussein of Jordan said Thursday an
Israeli proposal for Palestinian elections in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip could advance peace in the Middle East if it is part of
a broader negotiating effort.
   Standing with Secretary of State James A. Baker III after two
hours of talks at the State Department, Hussein appeared to be more
positive about the election proposal than he had been previously
but he stopped short of a full endorsement.
   ``It is not an end in itself,'' he told reporters.
   But, he said, ``the idea of election might be worth looking at
within the context of the whole process that hopefully will come
together to get us from where we are now to a final settlement.
Otherwise, the idea is out of context.''
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir made the proposal during a
visit here two weeks ago, suggesting that Palestinians in the
occupied territories choose ``interlocutors'' to represent them in
talks with Israel on limited self-government. The territories have
been wracked by violence for almost a year and a half.
   The Bush administration has said elections would be appropriate
so long as they lead to negotiations to determine the final status
of the territories.
   Hussein's visit caps two weeks of intensive negotiations that
have included visits by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as well as
Shamir.
   Hussein said he is more optimistic as a result of his current
visit than he has been in ``many, many years.'' His upbeat mood is
shared by top administration officials, based on comments offered
Wednesday night at a White House dinner in Hussein's honor.
   President Bush said in a toast to Hussein, ``We can sense an
urgency to the quest for peace now. Our task is to use that urgency
to seize the moment.''
   In his toast, Hussein pleased his hosts by pledging to cooperate
closely with the United States to achieve a ``just, durable and
comprehensive peace settlement.''
   ``We will support you in all your endeavors to achieve a
comprehensive just and lasting peace,'' he told Bush.
   Because of Jordan's proximity to the West Bank, the
administration regards Hussein's support for any peace process as
essential for its success.
   Administration officials appeared delighted with Hussein's
backing. He had seemed content to play a more peripheral role in
Middle East diplomacy last summer when he severed Jordan's ties
with West Bank Palestinians.
   Baker said Wednesday night that the ``beginning of a process''
is under way as a result of this month's discussions.
   ``It is important to do what he can to advance that process,''
Baker said.
   Shamir's election proposal is the newest element in the process,
and Baker left the clear impression that the administration has
carefully examined the kinds of issues that such an arrangement
would entail.
   Left unanswered thus far, he said, are such questions as who
would supervise elections in the territories, who would be entitled
to vote and whether voting rights should be extended to
Palestinians living outside the two areas.

   The Bush administration plans to collect $2.45
billion from profits of companies making ozone-destroying
chemicals, but a House committee chairman says it looks like a tax
_ and that's a job for Congress.
   The administration doesn't call it a tax against makers of
environmentally damaging chemicals. But, to Rep. John D. Dingell,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, it appears to
be an attempted end run around the taxing authority of Congress.
   The money would be collected either by a fee, favored by the
Environmental Protection Agency, or by auctioning the rights to
produce the chemicals, a proposal developed by the Office of
Management and Budget.
   Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said he hasn't decided whether
siphoning off the profits is a bad idea but he's making a lot of
negative comments about it.
   He said the administration has ``no specific authority'' to
collect the money, that courts ``view the taxing power of
government narrowly,'' that he's ``not sure'' House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., would approve, and
that ``I was reading Mr. Bush's lips like everyone else'' when the
president said he opposed new taxes.
   ``Before I come to a conclusion, I want to hear from a union
whose plant is going to be shut down,'' Dingell said, adding, ``it
is contingent on Congress enacting it, the people accepting it and
the courts approving it.''
   The manufacturers are not happy, either. ``They'll be sued. We
will challenge it for sure,'' said Tony Vogelsberg, an official
with Du Pont, the largest maker of the chemicals.
   Targets for the revenue-raising are windfall profits chemical
firms could make after an international treaty reduces supplies of
chlorofluorocarbons _ known as CFCs _ which poke holes in the ozone
layer and increase the risk of skin cancer. Industry is developing
substitutes, but those won't be ready for production for an
estimated three to five years.
   OMB has budgeted $400 million in revenues in fiscal 1990, $1.5
billion in 1991 and $550 million in 1992. The first-year revenue
figures survived an overall budget agreement between congressional
negotiators and the administration.
   ``We will get that $400 million somehow, one way or another,''
vowed OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay, referring to the first-year
projected revenues. ``You have to base the argument for windfall
profits on no cheap substitutes being available as supply decreases
and demand remains constant.''
   OMB and EPA have been arguing about how to collect the money,
but they agree _ and the industry denies _ that there eventually
will be windfall profits for manufacturers when the nation begins
implementing the 1987 Montreal Protocol to cut production of CFCs.
   The government's theory is that demand will far outstrip supply
some months after July, when production must be frozen at 1986
levels. The Montreal Protocol requires that by 1998, production can
be only 50 percent of 1986 figures.
   Despite the race to develop substitutes by the five
manufacturers of CFCs, EPA spokesman Chris Rice said the companies
may not hurry to produce them if they're making windfall profits on
current CFCs.
   ``The companies will be making 20 percent less (starting this
year), and the price could go up 500 to 600 percent,'' Rice said.
``They can bring in an incredible amount of money. We're afraid ...
they will have the incentive, because of the profit, to stall, to
delay ... introduction of the substitutes.''
   Vogelsberg said: ``We don't see windfall profits as really being
there.
   ``If I say I have a monopoly position and I'm going to raise the
price, you're going to remember what I did to you. I want to
maintain a long-term business relationship. We will not charge more
than our cost justifies.''
   CFCs are used in refrigerators, large air-conditioning units and
car air-conditioners, high energy foam insulation for modern
construction, solvents for cleaning computer components, and
cushions in seats and sofas.

<HEAD>Pope Receives Irish President; Urges End to Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Thursday met with
President Patrick J. Hillery of Ireland, calling for ``courageous
gestures of reconciliation'' to stop the sectarian bloodshed in
Northern Ireland.
   The pope urged all parties in the conflict to find a political
accord ``that will respect the legitimate rights and aspirations of
all the people of Northern Ireland.''
   ``Signs of hope are not lacking, and we shall pray and be
confident that a process guided by reason and mutual acceptance
will not be long in bringing an end to bloodshed and the secure
advent of a just reconciliation and peaceful reconstruction,'' John
Paul said in English.
   The pope, who visited Ireland in 1979, described the country as
``on the whole, a warm and loving society, secure in the rule of
law and rooted in the highest ideals of justice, freedom and
peace.''
   But he decried the ``deadly climate of intimidation and violence
which has caused so much suffering to both communities in Northern
Ireland during the past 20 years.''
   ``Only a genuine willingness to engage in dialogue and
courageous gestures of reconciliation goes to the heart of the
underlying causes of the present complex situation of conflict,''
he said.
   The Irish Republican Army for many years has waged a bloody
campaign to drive the British out of Northern Ireland and united it
with the predominantly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. Violence has
also been carried out by Protestant extremists.
   The pope said each ethnic and religious group has a right to
protect its identity but must also judge its claims in light of
``historical reality and the present reality.''
   ``Not to do so would involve the risk of remaining prisoners of
the past without prospects for the future,'' he said.
   Hillery, who met with the pope for 30 minutes, said some
progress toward reconciliation had been made in recent years but
that a ``small minority'' continued the violence.
   ``Only too aware of the suffering occasioned by fratricidal
strife and the blindness of ignorance and hate, we share strongly
your belief that violence is no solution to conflict,'' Hillery
said.

   When paramedic Kim Roderick went looking
for a charity to take the proceeds from sales of a calendar
featuring ``Paramedics Women of the Bay Area,'' she expected a warm
welcome.
   But she said at least a half-dozen organizations gave her a cold
shoulder and called it sexist when she raised the idea almost two
years ago.
   ``One said they didn't think it would generate enough money, but
they were really concerned about the exploitation of females,'' she
said Wednesday. ``I didn't believe I couldn't even give my money
away.''
   Roderick declined to identify the charities that turned her down.
   The full-color calendar depicts 12 female paramedics at work and
at play, including a shot of Roderick as Ms. May getting ready for
a night out.
   ``We didn't want to go out and do an exploitive number with
lingerie and garter belts,'' Roderick said. ``I made an effort not
to do that.''
   Finally, administrators at the Ronald McDonald House for
critically ill children and their families in Palo Alto, about 20
miles south of San Francisco, agreed to endorse the project.
   But Roderick, 26, laments that sales were slow until a national
television magazine show featured the calendar earlier this week.
   ``Men wanted more skin and some women were a little upset,'' she
said.
   The calendars, 10,000 of which were printed, have been available
since November, but only about 3,000 were sold before the price was
cut from $10 to $5 this month, said to Marti Hirsch, a spokeswoman
for Ronald McDonald House.
   Poses include uniformed paramedics relaxing in the back of an
ambulance and talking on the radio, a paramedic in a bathing suit
and tank top posing as a lifeguard and another in a bodysuit
working out in a gym.
   Frank McMahan, who supervises about 80 full-time members of the
San Francisco paramedic team, said he thought the calendar ``gives
females a bad image.''
   A paramedic brought a calendar to the office, but McMahan said
he kept it in a drawer. ``The women in the unit have not even seen
'em, and we don't want them to see 'em. In fact, the one in the
drawer was probably thrown away.''
   Roderick defended the project as an attempt to highlight
under-publicized paramedics in addition to raising money for
charity.

   The birth defect spina bifida will leave 13,000
children born in this decade struggling with its effects at an
annual cost of $100 million, federal health researchers predicted
Thursday.
   Each year, about 1,500 children are born in the United States
with spina bifida, the incomplete closing of the bony structure
surrounding the spinal cord. More than 1,000 survive into
childhood, often at tremendous medical expense, the national
Centers for Disease Control said in its weekly report Thursday.
   An estimated 9,800 children born with spina bifida from 1980 to
1987 were still alive in 1987, the CDC reported. By the end of
1990, that number is expected to grow to an estimated 13,000.
   ``In 1990, the average annual cost for medical and surgical care
for all surviving children born (with spina bifida) since 1980 will
approach $100 million,'' the Atlanta-based CDC reported.
   Further, the number of surviving spina bifida patients born
before 1980 is ``as large as those born after 1980 ... it is likely
that their costs would equal or exceed those of the post-1980
(patients),'' the CDC said.
   Spina bifida often strikes along with anencephaly, the absence
of major parts of the brain; in that case, most patients die a few
hours after birth.
   For the spina bifida patients who do survive, life is expensive.
   ``Infants with spina bifida routinely receive vigorous medical
therapy and undergo repeated surgical procedures to survive and
reach their maximum functional capacity,'' the CDC said. The
lifetime costs for such a patient can reach $250,000, according to
a 1985 North Carolina study cited by the federal researchers.
   The cause of spina bifida is unknown, but the disease rate is
decreasing _ from a rate of 5.2 cases per 10,000 births in 1980 to
4.3 in 1987.
   ``Nobody really knows why; it's really quite incredible,'' said
Dr. David Erickson, a CDC birth defects specialist. Some of the
decrease is due to new high-technology prenatal testing which gives
more mothers the option of terminating problem pregnancies, ``but
that doesn't explain all of it,'' he said.
   A previous CDC study found 50 percent fewer spina bifida cases
among women who took multivitamins during pregnancy, but
researchers haven't yet determined if that was the cause, or if
those women had other characteristics reducing their children's
risk.
   The CDC has declined to recommend widespread multivitamin
treatments for pregnant women ``without firmly knowing that it's
going to do something ... that's not good policy,'' Erickson said.

<HEAD>Department Acts Under Court Order to Eliminate Sex Discrimination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department, acting under court
decisions banning sex discrimination, is revamping its entrance
exam and informing about 600 female Foreign Service officers they
may be entitled to new jobs, it was disclosed on Thursday.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, discussing the
agency's response to a suit that dates back 13 years, said
Secretary of State James A. Baker III ``is firmly committed to
ensuring that there be no discrimination in the Department of State
of any kind. If past policies have contradicted this position, they
must and will be changed.''
   Boucher told reporters that the department sent cables to U.S.
embassies around the world and planned to inform employees of a
U.S. District Court ruling that the department has discriminated
against women in the Foreign Service dating back to 1976.
   The spokesman said the notification was sent to comply with a
court order issued Jan. 31 and outlines remedies to be provided.
   They include, he said, ``ensuring that there is no
discrimination against women in the future regarding assignments,
performance evaluation, occupational specialties, and superior
honor awards.''
   He added that the department is revamping its entrance exam for
Foreign Service officers because of a separate court order
``finding that the written exam has adversely affected women. We've
decided that that must change, and it will change.''
   The actions stem from a suit filed in 1976 by Alison Palmer, a
now-retired Foreign Service officer who claimed the department
discriminated against women in hiring and promotion, said Ms.
Palmer's attorney, Monica Wagner.
   The suit alleged the department discriminated against women by
hiring more men, giving men the better career assignments and more
career-advancing performance ratings and honor awards.
   Under the order, a woman is eligible for relief if she can show
that she sought or ``would have sought, absent discrimination'' any
of the department's better assignments.
   If cases of discrimination are found, the court order requires
the department to allow women to transfer to other job areas, be
offered other assignments and raise their performance ratings.
   Ms. Wagner said her client will not be a direct beneficiary of
the court order because she has retired. Only those women who are
part of the class-action suit and are still working for the Foreign
Service are affected.
   ``The benefit for her is in seeing the State Department take
action with respect to the sex discrimination found by the court,''
Ms. Wagner said.
   Ms. Wagner said some 600 women may be entitled to the
court-ordered relief.
   Boucher was asked by a reporter whether Baker planned to
``demonstrate his commitment to women's rights'' by naming more
women to high-level State Department posts.
   So far, Baker has named one woman as an assistant secretary of
state _ his longtime aide, Margaret Tutwiler, who is the assistant
secretary of state for public affairs.
   ``You mean, like my boss?'' Bocher responded, drawing laughter
from the journalists.
   Boucher noted that Baker had issued a statement on equal
opportunities shortly after taking office, and that not all
positions had been filled.
   ``In any case, he's very firmly committed to this. ... It's a
matter of great importance to him, and I'm sure he will carry it
out fully,'' said Boucher.
   The State Department had won the Palmer lawsuit in a lower court
but was reversed three months ago by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia.
   Boucher said the State Department has filed a notice of intent
to appeal the case, but added this was done ``in order to preserve
that option if it's appropriate after a full review by the
department and the Department of Justice.''

<HEAD>FAO Says Locust Plague in Africa Virtually Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plague of desert locusts that has lasted for more
than two years and aggravated food shortages in Africa is virtually
over, a U.N. agency said Thursday.
   ``A continuing decline in desert locust populations in Africa
and the Near East indicates that the current plague has virtually
collapsed,'' the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said.
   The locust plague, which began in the summer of 1986, has not
ended, but the FAO said the ``situation remains calm with only
Niger and Mali reporting infestations in the past 10 days.''
   FAO experts attributed the improvement to control measures, a
dry winter that hampered breeding and the deaths of many locusts
over the Atlantic Ocean.
   A locust swarm can cover more than one square mile with 50
million insects, capable of devastating 100 tons of vegetation a
day.
   In January, heavy crop damage was reported in Sudan, Ethiopia
and Chad, worsening already critical food shortages.
   In its latest report, the FAO said that ``only localized and
generally low density infestations'' remain in Mauritania, Senegal,
Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Kuwait.

   President Bush expressed frustration Thursday
over inability to end violence in war-ravaged Lebanon but said he
and other world leaders ``can't give up on it.''
   Discussing the violence during a question-and-answer session
with a group of reporters, Bush said, ``I wish there was a
short-term answer to stop the killing in Lebanon.''
   He said he discussed the problem by telephone earlier this week
with French President Francois Mitterrand but knew of ``no dramatic
plan in which the players in the area could agree to.''
   And Bush said the United States has little power to bring about
change.
   ``That's the problem, we don't have great influence in Lebanon
with the factions that are fighting,'' the president said.
   ``The problem, the short-run of it, how you stop this firing,
the shelling, how you get factions to stop warring, has certainly
in recent times defied solution,'' he said. ``But we can't give up
on it. We simply are not going to.''
   The State Department, meanwhile, said it welcomed a call by 23
Christian members of the Lebanese parliament urging a cease-fire
between the Syrian army and Lebanese armed forces.
   ``We strongly support their appeal for a political dialogue,''
said Richard Boucher, a department spokesman. ``It is a recognition
that Lebanon's current crisis can only be resolved through
consultation and reconciliation.''
   Boucher said the statement by the Lebanese parliamentarians
reflected the desires of ``the vast majority'' of both Christian
and Moslem Lebanese ``to seek a peaceful resolution to Lebanon's
political problems.''
   ``It underscores the critical importance of Lebanon's parliament
as a legitimate representative body and the crucial role it must
play in restoring a central government to the country,'' Boucher
said.
   ``We urge all sides, including Syria and General (Michel) Auoun,
to accept this call for a cease-fire and seek ways to resume a
political dialogue,'' he added.
   The battles started March 8 after Aoun, the army commander and
head of the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's divided government,
imposed a naval blockade on ports run by independent militias.
   Moslem militias then shelled Christian neigbhorhoods. Syria,
which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, joined the Moslems.
   ``We've been in touch with everybody we can find in Lebanon and
in the region to talk about this and to try to bring about a
solution,'' Boucher said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, testifying earlier in the
week before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Lebanon
``a great tragedy that is very, very intractable. It does not lend
itself to an easy solution.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's
discussion with Mitterrand touched on ways the United Nations might
act to calm the situation.
   ``Both presidents stressed their concern about the loss of life,
injuries, and deterioration of the situation in Beirut,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Mitterrand, who is scheduled to visit Bush at the U.S.
president's vacation home at Kennebunkport, Maine, next month, also
has contacted British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and several
other world leaders, soliciting their help in ending the war.
   During his talk with reporters along the colonnade leading to
the Oval Office, Bush did say he felt that U.S. standing with
``moderate Arab nations'' had improved, saying relations were ``as
good today as any time in recent history.''
   He said he felt the United States had ``restored some prestige
by the way we acted'' in policing the Persian Gulf waterway during
the latter stages of the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``We have, I think, much better communication now with Jordan,''
he said. Bush also said that ``we've kept good cooperation and
coordination with the Egyptians. The Israelis themselves attest to
the fact that they have great confidence in our administration.''
   ``We have some differences with all three of those,'' Bush added.

<HEAD>Canada Accuses East Bloc Countries of Nazi-style Media Control</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada on Thursday accused four communist
countries of gross violations of a new East-West accord on press
freedom and said their propaganda techniques and state-controlled
media resemble those of Nazi Germany.
   Canadian Ambassador William Bauer, addressing a 35-nation
conference monitoring compliance with the accord, said some of the
signatory states remained ``locked in a dark age of information
where the only `correct' facts are those put out by the ruling
party.''
   ``It is particularly poignant to observe that today, on the
100th anniversary of the birth of Hitler, the techniques of press
and information control which characterized his regime are still
being applied by some European governments,'' he added.
   Bauer, head of the Canadian delegation, said later he was
referring to Romania, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. He
described Romania as a ``sort of joke'' as a signatory to an accord
of press freedom and free speech.
   Romania's chief delegate, Ian Mitaan, accused Western critics of
``deplorable attempts at flagrant interference in the internal
affairs other countries.''
   Romania was the most reluctant signatory to the January accord
on press and other freedoms. It was signed in Vienna after a
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Bauer's criticisms came on the third day of a month-long London
conference known as the Information Forum.
   On Wednesday, the chief U.S. delegate, Leonard Marks, also
singled out Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany and Czechoslovakia as
having done nothing to implement the accord.
   In Romania, journalists and other users of typewriters have to
get their machines licensed and give police a record of the
typefaces. It is the country most frequently accused of ignoring
the January agreement.
   Western delegates have repeatedly praised the Soviet Union for
its policy of glasnost, or greater openness. They also have said
two other reformist communist states, Hungary and Poland, have made
significant improvements in allowing free speech but still have a
way to go.
   Hungary has announced widespread political reforms, including
plans to allow multiparty elections. In Poland, the government this
month signed a political accord with the free trade union,
Solidarity.
   Addressing the conference Thursday, Laszlo Demus, the chief
Hungarian delegate, called for an end to ``uncritical
self-adulation and idolization of leaders'' in state-controlled
media in Europe.
   ``If anything is redolent of the Middles Ages and alien to our
present-day Europeanism, it is this,'' said Demus.

<HEAD>First Funeral Held In Stadium Disaster</HEAD>

   Family and friends on Thursday mourned
a young carpenter who gave up his seat at a soccer game so he could
stand with his friends in another section, then died in Britain's
worst sports disaster.
   The funeral was the first among the 95 victims who died in
Saturday's disaster in Sheffield's Hillsborough stadium.
   Meanwhile, debate continue over how to prevent further tragedies.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reiterated her government's
determination to press ahead with a plan to require soccer fans to
have membership cards.
   Mrs. Thatcher urged lawmakers to support the proposed law aimed
at keeping violent fans out of stadiums, rather than ``do nothing
in the face of the deaths we have recently seen.''
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock said the government's
insistence on forcing through the bill by the start of the 1990-91
season was ``an offense against common decency.''
   Labor leaders say the plan won't cut violence outside the
stadiums.
   On Saturday, police opened a gate to allow as many as 3,000
late-arriving Liverpool fans to surge into an English Football
Association Cup semifinal match, and 95 people in a standing-room
section were crushed or trampled to death.
   Gary Church, 19, had a ticket for a seat in the stadium but gave
it up to stand with friends in the standing-room terraces, his
family said.
   Relatives and friends filled Christ Church in the Waterloo
district for Church's funeral on Thursday.
   Fans and police have been trading accusations over who was
responsible for the tragedy.
   Police have said drunkenness by Liverpool fans played a part.
But officers have been criticized for allowing late arrivals to
pour into the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
   Police say they had no choice but to open the gate to relieve a
dangerous crush outside.
   City council leaders called for a minute's silence in the cities
of Liverpool, Sheffield and Nottingham on Saturday at about the
time the disaster began at 3:06 p.m. (10:06 a.m. EDT)
   Former Beatle Paul McCartney and other Liverpool-born pop stars
are re-recording a popular 1964 ballad, ``Ferry Across the
Mersey,'' to raise money for the injured and the families of the
dead.
   The song, by the Liverpool band Gerry and the Pacemakers, is
about the northwest port city and the River Mersey that flows
through it. Lead singer Gerry Marsden is rerecording the song at a
London studio this week along with McCartney and the others.
   The record is to be released May 2.

   Two environmental groups said Thursday they
would sue the Energy Department to force a government study of the
environmental risks posed by the planned startup of a new plutonium
processing plant in California.
   The department said it has not yet decided whether such a study
is necessary.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Western States
Legal Foundation, in a letter to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins,
said they would sue the department if it failed to prepare an
environmental impact statement for the Engineering Demonstration
System before putting the plant into operation.
   The groups said the plant could begin running as early as this
summer, although Janie Shaheen, a department spokeswoman, said no
decision had been made on the timing of startup.
   In the letter to Watkins, the groups said an environmental
impact statement is required by the National Environmental Policy
Act. Ms. Shaheen said the department's field office in San
Francisco was considering the matter and ``will shortly be making
that decision.''
   The environmental groups said the proposed new plant, at the
department's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is intended to
demonstrate a new plutonium processing technology for use at the
department's proposed Special Isotope Separation plant in Idaho,
which would convert fuel-grade plutonium to weapon-grade plutonium.
   The groups said that because of the larger population in the
vicinity of the Livermore site, the Engineering Demonstration
System presents more potential health and safety risk than the
Idaho site, near Idaho Falls, for which an environmental impact
statement was prepared.
   ``It is reckless to think an (environmental impact statement) is
not needed for a facility which vaporizes sizeable quantities of
plutonium _ a potent cancer-causing substance _ in a highly
populated area subject to earthquakes,'' said Jim Werner, project
engineer at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Werner's group has a suit pending against the Energy Department
to force it to complete an environmental impact statement on the
proposed restart of three defense nuclear reactors in South
Carolina. The department has begun the environmental assessment
there but contends it is not required to complete it before
restarting the reactors, which make a radioactive gas used in
nuclear warheads.

<TEXT>
   An amateur historian has withdrawn his bid to
make Al Capone's home a historic landmark, a move hailed Thursday
by an Italian-American leader who said, ``This is not the kind of
image we want to be presenting to the world.''
   Capone's modest, two-story brick house on Chicago's South Side
was nominated for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places in January. Rejected by local groups, the nomination was
appealed by Mark Levell, a computer repairman.
   He withdrew his appeal Wednesday, saying, ``I still think the
house has tremendous historical interest, but I have no intention
of offending anyone, and some people left me no doubt that they
quite clearly are offended by it.''
   Levell, who is half-Italian, has made an extensive study of
Prohibition-era crime history.
   Other Italian-Americans failed to share Levell's interest in the
house, said Robert Allegrini, executive director of the
Italian-American Committee.
   ``No one man has done so much harm to the good name of his
ethnic group as Al Capone has done for Italian-Americans. This is
not the kind of image we want to be presenting to the world,'' said
Allegrini.
   The proposal had been opposed by Italian-American groups, the
Chicago Sun-Times and a local neighborhood council. The Chicago
Landmarks Commission, Illinois Historic Sites Council and a city
report had also recommended against the house's memorialization.
   Critics ``complained that I was trying to honor a notorious
criminal, but I never said anything about `honor,''' Levell said.
``The Prohibition gangsters were part of this city's history. ...
They were colorful men, but I never suggested them as role models
for anyone.''
   Levell said Capone lived in the house from 1920 to 1928, but
later moved into the Lexington Hotel for security. He said Capone's
mother and several of his brothers remained in the house after
Capone moved out.
   Capone, who was sent to Alcatraz on federal tax violations, died
of syphilis in 1947.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department inched closer
Thursday to new federal regulations on making old-fashioned country
hams, in a rule-making process that began more than six years ago.
   The country ham issue began in March 1983 when the department
initially proposed new safety rules for commercial processors. But
industry challenges, USDA tinkering and other hurdles kept pushing
back the rule-making deadline, which is currently Dec. 31, 1989.
   Country hams are most commonly found in cloth bags in
supermarkets and country stores, preserved from spoilage by salt,
smoke and air for months and even years. They must be scraped,
soaked and cooked before being eaten.
   Most hams in supermarket meat counters are wet-cured quickly in
brine solutions and cooked before sale to consumers.
   In its latest move, the USDA proposes ``to allow certain amounts
of potassium chloride as an alternative to salt'' in the curing of
country hams to kill trichinae, microscopic parasitic worms. If
improperly cooked and eaten, infested meat can cause a disease
called trichinosis in humans.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said federal regulations currently
allow three curing methods for destroying trichinae in ham. The
proposal modifies two of the methods and provides an additional
method.
   Crawford said the proposed new method would allow processors to
substitute potassium chloride for some of the sodium chloride _
salt _ in the curing mixture.
   Current rules call for a 4 percent salt content to ensure safety
of the ham. But research by North Carolina State University
indicates that some substitution of potassium chloride can be
allowed without compromising safety, he said. A minimum salt
content in the cure mixture would be required, but up to half the
weight could consist of potassium chloride.
   The proposal also would eliminate the current ``method No. 2''
for destroying trichinae, which involves injecting a salt water
solution into the ham. Crawford said his agency believes this
method is no longer being used commercially.
   Public comments on the country ham proposal can be sent through
June 19 to: Policy Office, Attn: Linda Carey, FSIS Hearing Clerk,
Room 3171-S, FSIS, USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, vowing to ``keep America first
in space,'' made good on a campaign promise and signed an order
Thursday re-establishing the National Space Council.
   At a ceremony with council members, Bush said that 20 years ago
``an entire generation of Americans was inspired by the space
program. We must continue on the path we've blazed in earlier
decades with a renewed dedication.''
   Bush designated Vice President Dan Quayle as chairman of the
council. Other members include the secretaries of State, Treasury,
Defense, Commerce, Transportaton, the budget director, the head of
NASA, the White House national security adviser and the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Bush said the action fulfilled a campaign promise he made 18
months ago at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   ``I pledged then and I'm proud now to re-establish the National
Space Council,'' Bush said.
   The council had been disbanded in the mid-1970s.
   The president re-established the unit with an executive order.
The council was told to review U.S. space policy and to make
recommendations for long-range goals and activities.
   Thursday's ceremony was held in Quayle's office in the Old
Executive Office Building.
   ``Under his able leadership, I'm confident that the space
council will bring coherence and continuity and commitment to our
efforts to explore, study and develop space,'' Bush said.
   Quayle welcomed the former vice president back to ``your former
office,'' and said: ``Mr. President, we take your charge with a
great deal of seriousness.''
   ``Space is certainly the frontier _ it is a frontier that we
understand and we're going to be there,'' Quayle said.
   Bush has called for a $2 billion, or 19 percent, increase in
spending on space programs the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. He
has proposed a build-up in the rate of space shuttle flights to
nine in 1990, and has voiced support for on-schedule construction
of the manned space station Freedom.
   ``Space is vitally important to our nation's future and to the
quality of life here on Earth,'' Bush said. ``It offers a
technological frontier creating jobs for tomorrow.''
   ``Space is the manifest destiny of a new generation and a new
century,'' he continued. ``I plan to sign this executive order with
one objective in mind: to keep America first in space.''
   ``It's only a matter of time before the world salutes the first
men and women on their way outward into the solar system. All of us
want them to be Americans.''

   The school board was set to declare a
week in May as Holocaust Week, but ruffled some members' feelings
when it scheduled the vote for Passover.
   The board postponed the matter Wednesday night after learning
its two Jewish members couldn't attend the meeting. Passover, a
Jewish holiday celebrating the freeing of the Israelites from
slavery in Egypt, began at sundown.
   With five of nine members absent, the board rescheduled the
meeting for Tuesday.
   ``There have been several different occasions when important
functions were scheduled on holidays,'' said board member Fannie G.
Krevsky, who is Jewish. ``I just felt that enough was enough.''
   Board President Clarice L. Chambers said the district ``has
always been sensitive to our Jewish community, even in the
assistance in the restoration and cleanup of the recent desecration
of the Kesher Israel Synagogue'' in Harrisburg by vandals.
   She said she didn't know until this week that Passover began
Wednesday evening.
   ``My calendar has it beginning on Thursday,'' she said. ``In the

are not in conflict with religious holidays.''

   While seeking U.S. military aid, Cambodia's
non-communist resistance still prefers a peaceful political
solution to the Southeast Asian country's problems, resistance
leader Son Sann said Thursday.
   President Bush's administration is considering providing some
weapons assistance and the proposal has backing in Congress, Son
Sann said after meeting with administration officials.
   Hopefully, he said, the weapons would never be used but they are
needed to press the communist side to negotiate an acceptable
agreement and ``to send a signal to the Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese
that we can become stronger.''
   The war- and occupation-ravaged country has had enough bloodshed
and ``we don't want a settlement leaving any Cambodian party back
in the jungles'' for more fighting, said the 77-year-old former
premier.
   The State Department said earlier this week that increased U.S.
help should be provided the non-communist resistance but no
decision has been reached on composition of the aid.
   Son Sann said he is taking to Southeast Asia a new suggestion
for the U.N. Secretary General and his representatives to take a
dominant role in organizing and supervising free elections for a
future Cambodian government.
   Son Sann leads the smallest of four Cambodian factions involved
in complex negotiations involving the superpowers and other
permament members of the U.N. Security Council, the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978
and which has promised to withdraw all its forces in the coming
months.
   The other Cambodian factions are led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
former head of state; Premier Hun Sen of the Vietnamese-installed
Peoples Republic of Kampuchea regime in Pnomh Penh and the Khmer
Rouge, blamed for the deaths of more than 2 million Cambodians
during a 1975-78 reign of terror.
   Son Sann is heading for London and Paris before returning to
Bangkok. In Bangkok he plans to brief Sihanouk in preparation for
what he described as a crucial May 2 meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia,
between Sihanouk and Hun Sen.
   ``It will be very bad,'' if the two sides remain deadlocked, he
said, urging that Hun Sen consider Sihanouk's proposals without
continuing to insist that his government conduct the proposed
elections.
   Son Sann said he is taking to Sihanouk a suggestion of Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Asian
subcommittee, for U.N. Secretary General Xavier Perez de Cuellar to
organize an interim government for Cambodia with a special U.N.
representative in charge of verifying a cease-fire and organizing
and supervising elections.
   Hun Sen has earlier rejected a proposal for a Cambodian
government of all four factions to conduct the elections.
   A PRK-Vietnamese proposal for the 35-year-old Indochina Control
Commission of India, Poland and Canada to supervise the elections
is unacceptable to the non-communists because India, one of the few
countries to recognize the Hun Sen government ``is not neutral,''
Son Sann said.
   A successful Sihanouk-Hun Sen meeting would be followed by a
mid-May working session in Paris of envoys of all four factions,
and a June summit of the faction leaders, Son Sann said.
   Final stage of the settlement process, he added, would be an
international conference on Cambodia at which the accords should be
guaranteed by the United States, France, Britain, China and the
Soviet Union.
   Vietnam has announced 50,000 of its soldiers remain to be
withdrawn from Cambodia. Son Sann estimated the number of
Vietnamese remaining as 70,000-80,000 military personnel, plus
hundreds of thousands of settlers, many disguised as Cambodians.
   The Khmer Rouge, he said, have 35,000 fighters and Sihanouk's
forces number 18,000. Son Sann said his own faction counts 10,000
activists, plus unorganized, latent support from most of the nation.

   About 1,500 students braved a daylong downpour
and marched for democracy in the capital Thursday, and authorities
threatened ``harsh measures'' to crush four days of dissent.
   About 1,000 students marched in the central Chinese city of
Nanjing, and students in Tianjin, a port city east of Beijing,
plastered posters on walls. Other marches were also reported in
Shanghai, Wuhan and Hefei, but details were sketchy.
   Nationally televised news led with a stern warning that the
protests, the biggest since the pro-democracy demonstrations of
1986-87, would no longer be tolerated.
   ``These activities have gone beyond the limits of the law and
the taking of harsh measures to end the disturbances has become
necessary,'' the announcer said, quoting from an editorial by the
official Xinhua News Agency.
   ``These protesters do not really care about the future or
happiness of China, all they want to do is overthrow the Communist
Party and the government,'' the editorial said.
   The protests were prompted by the death Saturday of Hu Yaobang,
an outspoken reformer who was ousted as Communist Party chief in
1987. Hu was accused of encouraging liberal ideas and failing to
crack down on the 1986-87 student demonstrators.
   The Beijing city government issued regulations that restricted
commemoration activities for Hu to inside universities, businesses
and factories.
   The regulations also said ``rioters and other lawbreakers would
be dealt with severely, according to the law.''
   Early Thursday, thousands of security forces rushed into crowds
of students as they protested near the headquarters of the ruling
Communist Party.
   Student organizers said security forces beat more than 200
students, injuring about 40. Between 40 and 50 were arrested, they
said.
   There was no official report on the arrests or injuries, but
Associated Press reporters witnessed several beatings and
detainments.
   Thursday afternoon, students from several universities marched
for hours under heavy rain to Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center
of Chinese political life.
   In the evening, they rallied around the huge obelisk
commemorating China's revolutionary heroes, now draped with
eulogies and portraits of Hu.
   ``The blood of our classmates will not be shed in vain,'' said
one student leader. ``Since the time of the first emperor 2,000
years ago China has been living under a dictatorship. It is time
for this to end.''
   Students huddled closely under tattered umbrellas as the wind
and rain howled about them.
   Student speakers said they were demanding that officially
controlled student unions at their schools be disbanded and
replaced with democratic organizations.
   The student demands formulated Monday include free speech, a
free press, more money for education and disclosure by officials of
their incomes and bank accounts.
   ``We don't oppose specific people, we oppose dictatorship,'' one
speaker said Thursday evening. But some students have singled out
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who has failed to satisfy
intellectuals' demands for political reform.
   Turnout was much lower than for previous days' activities, which
peaked when about 6,000 students rallied before about 20,000
onlookers, then marched on party headquarters late Wednesday and
early Thursday.
   By 9:30 p.m., the protesters, drenched with rain and chilled by
a cool breeze, began to march back to their universities.
   As the protesters returned home, hundreds of police officers
came out of hiding and poured into buses and trucks that left the
square. Some security forces were armed with rifles, the first time
arms have been openly displayed during the protests.
   In Nanjing, about 1,000 students set out Thursday night from
Nanjing University toward the Jiangsu provincial government
offices, said an American teacher at the school on condition of
anonymity.
   It was not clear whether they reached the offices. The teacher
said a similar number of students marched Wednesday night for about
four hours, carrying banners and chanting, ``Down with
dictatorship!''
   A Chinese student from Nankai University in Tianjin said the
walls of his schools were plastered with posters and poems calling
for democracy.

<HEAD>Official Says Tear Gas Could Have Caused Injuries, Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Highly concentrated tear gas could have caused the
symptoms that prompted some officials to charge that soldiers used
nerve gas in a violent clash with protesters in Soviet Georgia, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday.
   ``It would be unwarranted if we were to talk about nerve gas,''
spokesman Yuri Gremitskykh said at a news briefing, despite reports
in the government newspaper Izvestia that protesters had been
injured by an aerosol with an effect like atropine, a nerve poison.
   At least 20 demonstrators died April 9 when soldiers were
ordered to clear a crowd of pro-independence demonstrators.
Witnesses say the troops attacked with shovels, clubs and gas, and
chased down fleeing demonstrators to beat them to death. Georgian
activists claim several deaths were caused by the gas.
   Gremitskykh cited media reports that tear gas had been used
against the demonstrators, and he told reporters that highly
concentrated tear gas could have caused the injuries that Georgian
Health Minister Irakly Menagarishvili blamed on a substance like
atropine.
   Atropine is a poisonous crystalline alkaloid that in large doses
can induce nerve paralysis and delirium. It can cause death through
combined cardiac and respiratory failure.
   Gremitskykh said the cause of death must be established by
medical experts. There has been no official account of the number
of protesters poisoned by the gas.
   Meanwhile, another group of Moscow intellectuals joined the
condemnation of the decision to send troops to clear peaceful
demonstrators.
   April, a group of progressive writers, adopted a resolution
protesting ``the cruelty of the army and the brutal methods of
authorities,'' said a member, Marina Pristavkin.
   The group's resolution was written by noted poet Yevgeny
Yevtushenko, she said. Several members also signed an open letter
written by human rights activist Andrei Sakharov condemning the
confrontation in Tbilisi.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a native of
Georgia and its former Communist Party chief, has called the clash
in Tbilisi a blow to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to
reform Soviet society. Shevardnadze was sent to Tbilisi after the
clash in an effort to try to restore order.
   The republic's leadership assumed responsibility for the clash
and the Communist Party leader and premier resigned.
   Protests began in early April in reaction to demands by the
small Black Sea area of Abkhazia to be separated from Georgia, but
turned into massive protests by groups demanding Georgian
independence. Soldiers were ordered into Georgia on April 7.
   Georgia has been closed to foreign journalists, but Gremitskykh
announced that small groups of reporters would be allowed to visit
Tbilisi beginning Sunday.
   Official reports Thursday said Tbilisi remained calm but that a
Soviet army officer was beaten severely by assailants Wednesday
night, two nights after a curfew was lifted.
   Krasnaya Zvezda, the Defense Ministry newspaper, said the
officer was attacked in the area of Tbilisi's military hospital as
he was on his way home. He suffered a brain concussion and was in
serious condition, the paper quoted doctors as saying. It said the
unidentified attackers managed to get away.

   Vice President Dan Quayle conducted the
swearing-in of the Energy Department's No. 2 and No. 3 officials
Thursday and said the White House was eager to see the department
quickly overcome its many internal problems.
   After administering the oath of office to Henson Moore, the
deputy energy secretary, and John C. Tuck, the undersecretary of
energy, Quayle reiterated in a speech to department employees that
President Bush was committed to keeping the department. Former
President Ronald Reagan once pledged to dismantle it.
   ``The Department of Energy is here to stay _ there is no
question about that,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle told Energy Secretary James D. Watkins that Bush was
counting on him to resolve a wide array of department problems.
Quayle was not more specific, but Watkins has identified his chief
tasks as modernizing the nation's nuclear weapons complex and
putting together a new national energy policy.
   ``You have a tremendous challenge ahead of you, but knowing you
and the spirit and the type of people that you have surrounded
yourself with, those challenges will not be difficult,'' Quayle
said.
   Moore, in a reference to recent publicity about the department's
failures, said some people are describing it as being ``the
last-place team'' among the 14 Cabinet departments.
   ``I assure you, Mr. Vice President, that's not going to be the
final ranking when the season is over,'' he said.

<HEAD>School's Plan to Raise Money from Students' Deaths Enlivens Debate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Boston University proposal to raise money by
taking out life insurance policies on students drew mixed reviews
Thursday, with some terming it a ghoulish scheme and others
applauding its money-making potential.
   BU President John Silber has proposed taking out policies on
students and alumni and collecting the benefits when they die.
   ``It's very much in the discussion kind of stage. Numbers and
fine points are to be worked out, if ever,'' said Tom Cashman, vice
president of public affairs.
   Some students were aghast at the idea of the school benefiting
from their deaths, even though the program would be voluntary.
   ``I have a feeling he hasn't thought this through. It's going to
make it a Dracula kind of school,'' said Drew Kodjak, a graduate
student at BU's law school.
   ``I have to give him credit. It's a great idea,'' said Steven
Cagnetta, also a law student. ``It just doesn't sit right.''
   Silber discussed the proposal publicly last week before a group
of scholarship students. The university newspaper, the Daily Free
Press, later published an account of his remarks. Silber was not in
his office Thursday.
   Cashman said he has received some positive calls from donors
interested in the proposal.
   ``It's not as negative as some of our reviewers want to cast
it,'' he said. ``It's an opportunity for individuals who are
concerned about the longterm financial health of the university 50,
60 or 70 years down the line to make a contribution that far
exceeds what they otherwise would be able to do.''
   Money to buy the policies probably would come from a
fund-raising drive and students would neither pay nor receive money
for participating.
   The plan calls for purchasing 1,000 policies worth $350,000 at a
cost of $5,500 each, with BU listed as policy owner. The school
would then wait 10 years before buying more. Eventually, the
original 1,000 policies would be worth $350 million, several times
the original outlay.
   Insurance officials said the idea seemed to be a new development
in the traditional method of deferred giving. Other universities
have suggested their alumni make their alma mater part of their
estate plans, including naming schools as beneficiaries of life
insurance policies.
   At St. Louis University in Missouri, a plan under which an
alumnus makes a gift and then allows the school to take out a life
insurance policy under his name has created a future endowment of
$16 million, said the Rev. J. Barry McGannon, vice president for
development.
   But he said the BU program appears to be of far greater scope
than other plans.
   Silber has said he wants to raise $1 billion by the year 2000.
   ``It's a gimmick, of course. It's a twist on what we've heard
of,'' said Ben Isaacs, spokesman for the American Council of Life
Insurance in New York. Some corporations already are starting to
ensure their employees, but Isaacs said he hasn't heard of colleges
doing so. ``We think this may be a developing thing.''
   ``I think it sounds inventive and interesting,'' said Paul
Miller, vice president of the Council for Aid to Education in
Washington. ``I'd like to know more about it.''

   Afghan guerrillas fired a rocket into
the Soviet Embassy on Thursday, shattering windows of an
administration building but causing no casualties, Soviet officials
said.
   Soviet diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
did not believe the attack was deliberate.
   They said the rocket was fired from about 20 miles northwest of
the capital.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported in Moscow, ``It was only by
mere luck that no resident of the Soviet Embassy compound was
hurt.''
   The United States closed its embassy in Kabul before Soviet
troops completed their withdrawal Feb. 15. Since then, Moslem
insurgents have attacked Kabul intermittently but have concentrated
their attack on the eastern city of Jalalabad.
   Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said
Wednesday that government forces killed 148 insurgents and wounded
67 in fighting around Jalalabad and killed 50 more in Kandahar,
Herat, Paktia, Laghman and Faryab provinces.
   Guerrilla spokesmen claimed their fighters ambushed a military
convoy north of Kabul and killed 50 government servicemen.
   Neither side said when the fighting occurred, but government
reports usually concern the previous 24 hours. Each side
consistently exaggerates the other's losses, and their claims
cannot be verified.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan, reported Thursday
that rebel rocket attacks on Jalalabad killed two people. The
guerrillas were reportedly blasting the city from key positions to
the south and east, said Radio Kabul. The radio also said four
people were hurt Thursday when rockets blasted Kabul.
   Jalalabad's fall would be considered a coup for the rebels, who
have not yet managed to take any of Afghanistan's key cities.
   In Islamabad, the president of the guerrillas' new
government-in-exile on Thursday offered Afghanistan's Marxist
president, Najib, protection if he resigns and hands power over to
an interim guerrilla government.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi said, ``We will give him protection. If
they (ruling Marxists) transfer power to our government then we
will give them protection and amnesty.''
   He did not say if Najib would qualify for amnesty. He only
offered him protection.
   Mojaddidi was responding to Najib's offer Wednesday to resign if
it would end the decade-long war.
   Yahya Nauroz, the provisional government's military chief of
staff, said in Islamabad that the government-in-exile will begin
receiving arms directly from its supporters rather than through
Pakistan. Among nations supporting the guerrillas are the United
States, China and Saudi Arabia.
   ``The mujahedeen (holy warriors) will directly receive the next
consignment of arms,'' possibly within two weeks, he said, but he
would not name the suppliers.
   The United States is a leading arms supplier to the guerrillas,
who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978.
   Soviet soldiers entered the war in December 1979, and an
estimated 115,000 were in Afghanistan when the withdrawal began in
May 1988.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Noriega's new plan to require
visas for U.S. citizens visiting Panama is an attempt to avoid
international scrutiny during next month's elections, the State
Department charged on Thursday.
   ``Noriega's latest action is an effort to insulate Panama's
electoral process from any credible degree of public scrutiny,''
said department spokesman Richard Boucher.
   The Noriega regime has announced that as of April 21, Americans
may no longer travel to Panama by simply filling out a tourist
card. The card was given to tourists at the airport of their point
of departure.
   The opposition, which has expressed fears the polling will be
rigged by the government, has invited hundreds of foreigners to
visit Panama for the national May 7 election.
   The key race involves a Noreiga-backed candidate for president
against an opposition leader.
   Boucher added that Noriega's officials have also begun to screen
visa applications in third countries ``in an effort to deny travel
to Panama of election observers, journalists and other persons
interested in covering the Panama electoral process.''
   Noriega is under indictment in Florida on drug smuggling
charges. The United States has maintained that it cannot have
normal relations with the Panamanian government until Noriega steps
down.
   The spokesman contrasted the new visa restriction with ``the
recent Salvadoran election and the upcoming Paraguay election where
election observers, press and diplomatic scrutiny have been
actively and openly welcomed.''
   The spokesman said the election would provides an opportunity
for Panamanians ``to move forward to a resolution of the continuing
political and economic crisis. A fraudulent election will only
perpetuate Panama's problems.
   ``A legitimate regime has nothing to fear from an honest
election and from the unfettered presence of observers and of the
press,'' Boucher said.
   The requirement could create headaches for U.S. citizens who
want to visit Panama because most Panamanian consulates in the
United States are not recognized by Noriega's regime. The rule
states that U.S. citizens must have visas stamped by ``Panamanian
consulates recognized by our government.''
   Only the consulate in Tampa, Fla., is said to be recognized by
Noriega's followers.
   The majority of diplomatic offices in the United States have
remained loyal to the ousted president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, who
has moved to Miami.
   In February, 1988, Delvalle attempted to fire Noriega from his
post as defense chief, but within hours he was deposed by the
legislature dominated by Noriega followers.

   In addition, the government plans to sell 250 Maverick missiles,
their support equipment, publications and training and technical
assistance to Spain at a cost of $48 million.
   The foreign sales are subject to congressional approval.
   The M48A5 tanks are no longer in production and will come from
excess stock. The department, in a statement, said Greece needs the
tanks to upgrade its tank fleet and increase its military defense
capability.
   The prime contractor of the Harpoon missiles will be
McDonnell-Douglas Astronautics Co., of St. Louis, Mo., the
department said.
   A prime contractor on the missile sale to Spain will be made
after the competitive bidding process.

   Preliminary tests suggest unhealthy levels of
radon in schools across the country, the Environmental Protection
Agency said Thursday in urging every school to test for the
odorless, cancer-causing gas.
   ``Based on measurements taken in 3,000 schoolrooms in 16 states,
it appears that elevated levels of radon gas can be found in
schools throughout the United States,'' EPA Administrator William
K. Reilly told a luncheon at the National Press Club.
   The EPA said that 54 percent of 130 public schools tested in 41
communities had at least one room in which radon levels were found
to exceed 4 picocuries per liter of air, indicating a need for
additional tests and, likely, corrective action.
   In 101 rooms tested at schools in five states, levels of at
least 20 picocuries per liter were found, comparable to what would
be found in uranium mines.
   EPA spokeswoman Martha Casey said no list of the schools tested
was immediately available, but affected state authorities and
school officials have been told of the test results.
   Reilly called indoor radon, the result of natural radioactive
decay in the ground, ``one of the major environmental health
threats facing Americans'' and urged that school officials
nationwide test their schoolrooms for the gas.
   He said it is ``important that school administrators nationwide
understand both the seriousness of the risk and the relative
simplicity of testing and fixing the problem.''
   There is no federal law requiring tests for the radioactive gas,
although the EPA by law is required to conduct sample tests
nationwide in homes and schools to determine potential health
threats. The preliminary findings from the 16 states came from
two-day tests in rooms normally occupied by students, teachers and
school staff, Ms. Casey said.
   Last September, the EPA urged all homeowners to conduct radon
tests after unhealthy levels _ 4 picocuries per liter of air _ of
radon were found in one out of four homes tested in 17 states.
   The agency has said that exposure over a lifetime at that level
is equivalent to smoking 10 cigarettes a day. The EPA said studies
have indicated indoor exposure to radon may cause up to 20,000 lung
cancer deaths a year, which would make such deaths second only to
those caused by smoking.
   The latest EPA tests, although preliminary, indicate that
unhealthy radon levels in schools are at least as widespread as in
residences, although the agency emphasized that the levels may
range widely from school to school and even among rooms in the same
school.
   Guimond estimated in an interview that from the data obtained in
the limited number of tests it is estimated that students in
probably 10 percent of the nation's schools are exposed to
long-term radon levels that exceed the 4 picocuries standard.
   The EPA said that of the 3,000 schoolrooms tested, 19 percent
had levels of 4 picocuries or more and 3 percent had levels of at
least 20 picocuries.
   The agency gave this breakdown of states with schoolrooms having
radon levels of at least 20 picocuries: Tennessee, 77 rooms;
Washington, 14; New Mexico, 7; Maine, 2, and Montana, 1.
   The highest level was found in a schoolroom in Tennessee in
which 136 picocuries per liter of air were detected. Schools with
unusually high levels _ ranging from 25 to 98 picocuries per liter
of air in a single schoolroom _ were Washington (98 picocuries),
Montana (51), New Mexico (41) and Maine (25).
   Richard Guimond, the EPA's director of radiation programs, said
such levels ``are not that unique'' at schools located in areas
where significant radon is present in the ground and where
ventilation systems often suck radon into buildings. ``When these
two things occur, you're going to get those high levels,'' he said.
   Federal standards call for uranium miners to wear special
breathing equipment when working long periods in radon levels of 16
to 20 picocuries, said Guimond.
   The other states in which schools were tested were were Nevada,
Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri,
Illinois, Indiana, Georgia and New Jersey.
   The agency said exposure levels are difficult to determine from
the test data because students in many schools move from room to
room during the day and because radon levels may vary widely among
the rooms in a school.
   According to the agency, unhealthy radon levels also have been
found in EPA tests in schools in Virginia, Florida, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and Iowa. Those findings were not
part of the latest study and no additional information was
available.
   Radon is a naturally produced gas that is colorless, odorless
and tasteless. It is the product of the natural radioactive decay
of Radium-226 in the soil and rocks. While levels normally found
outdoors _ 0.2 to 0.7 picocurie per liter _ post no known dangers,
accumulated concentrations can be much higher indoors.
   Scientists have said that the health risks of radon depend not
only on the concentration of radon at a given time, but also on the
length of exposure. Estimated health risks normally are based on
exposure over a lifetime.
   The EPA estimates that as many as 15 percent of lung cancer
deaths annually may be related to radon exposure. While smoking
remains clearly the major cause of lung cancer, a combination of
heavy smoking and lifelong exposure to high levels of radon sharply
increases the chances of lung cancer, according to studies by the
National Acacemy of Sciences.
   The EPA said radon tests were conducted in public schools in
these communities:
   Maine _ Gorham, Biddeford, Sanford. New Jersey _ Randolph, Long
Valley. Tennessee _ Nashville (metropolitan area). Georgia _
Decatur, Lilburn. Illinois _ Peoria. Indiana _ Michigan City, La
Porte, Rolling, Claypool, Warsaw, Milford.
   Minnesota _ Buffalo, Burnsville, Rosemont, Shakopee, Scandia,
New Prague, Carver, Chaska, St. Paul, Little Canada, Red Wing,
Minneapolis Minnetonka, Cleveland.
   New Mexico _ Los Alamos. Kansas _ Overland Park. Missouri _
Kansas City, Independence. Wyoming _ Wright, Gillette, Dubois.
Montana _ Butte. North Dakota _ Bismarck. Colorado _ Denver
(metropolitan area).
   Nevada _ Las Vegas (metropolitan area). Washington _ Spokane
(metropolitan area).

<HEAD>US, Contras Criticize Election Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department and the Nicaraguan
Contras criticized on Thursday a new law approved by the
Sandinista-dominated legislature, contending that it will favor
pro-government candidates in next February's elections.
   Although the text of the legislation has not been made public,
opposition leaders in Nicaragua said the law, approved Tuesday
night, allows government representatives to dominate the
all-powerful Supreme Electoral Council.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the
council, in order to achieve legitimacy, has to fairly represent
the people of Nicaragua.
   ``The structure that's been passed in this legislation is not
one that can lead ... to further steps that would ensure the
legitimacy of the elections,'' he said.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros used stronger language in
criticizing the legislation.
   ``We endorse position of the (internal) opposition that this
will only serve to create a fraud. We cannot be an accomplice to
such a process,'' Matamoros said.
   He said the Sandinistas ``want to rule by force and not by
consent.''
   A bi-partisan task force of eight U.S. election law experts who
spent four days in Managua earlier this month also criticized the
legislation Thursday.
   Citing information provided by credible diplomatic and
opposition sources, the eight said in a statement issued at a news
conference, ``We believe the new law will not provide an adequate
foundation for a free and fair election in Nicaragua.''
   The group, made up of five Democrats and three Republicans,
visited Nicaragua under the sponsorship of Freedom House, a private
organization which promotes democracy worldwide.
   The legislation also has been denounced by Costa Rican Foreign
Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto, who called the election law a
``bad start'' that was ``far from reaching the goals for fulfilling
all that was promised'' by the Sandinistas during a Central
American summit meeting in February.
   At that meeting, the Sandinista government promised to hold free
elections next February in exchange for the closing of Contra bases
in Honduras. Central American leaders are attempting to draw up a
plan that will lead to the demobilization of the rebels.
   The Bush administration has declined to seek additional military
aid for the rebels and instead is focussing its energies on using
diplomatic, political and economic pressures on the Sandinistas in
hopes of encouraging a democratic outcome.
   Discussing the conflicts over the election law, Boucher said, ``
We believe the best way to resolve these differences is for the
government to sit down with the internal opposition and negotiate.
   ``Both sides will need to seek common ground and must be willing
to compromise if trust and legitimacy is to be created in this
first crucial step in the process.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shellshocked residents emerged cautiously
from bunkers Thursday during an uncertain lull to face shortages of
water, bread and electricity after 42 days of bombardments by rival
Christian and Moslem forces.
   The guns and rocket launchers, which by police count have fired
more than 100,000 projectiles since March 8, were mostly silent.
Occasional salvos kept people on edge.
   ``We'll be lucky if this lull persists and we manage to get some
sleep,'' said grocer Youssef Aridi as he closed his store in Moslem
west Beirut after opening it briefly to sell what few goods he had
left.
   The latest spasm of shelling, which began at dusk Saturday,
inexplicably slackened late Wednesday.
   The quiet followed a cease-fire call Tuesday from 23 Christian
Parliament deputies. But Gen. Michel Aoun, whose mainly Christian
army forces have been battling an alliance of Syrian troops and
Moslem Druse militiamen, rejected that call.
   The leftist As-Safir daily termed the lull a ``half-truce.'' The
Christian Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. called it ``an ambigious
cease-fire.''
   Whatever the reason for it, the break gave people a chance to
get out of the shelters in which they've been cooped up, check
their homes and businesses for damage and buy what food and
supplies were available.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said it was a double-edged sword.
   ``It's good to give the people a breather so they can get some
sleep. But it's risky as well because people might get used to it
and forget the dangers of renewed shelling. That's when you get
heavy casualties,'' he said.
   About 200 university students demonstrated outside the U.S.
Embassy in the Christian suburb of Aukar, chanting anti-Syrian
slogans.
   The pro-Aoun protesters brandished placards calling on the Bush
administration to help drive the Syrian army out of Lebanon.
   Bush told reporters in Washington Thursday that he and other
world leaders ``can't give up'' trying to end the violence in
Lebanon.
   But he said the United States does not have ``great influence in
Lebanon with the factions that are fighting.''
   By police count, at least 270 people have been killed and nearly
1,000 wounded since March 8.
   Among them was Spanish Ambassador Pedro Manuel de Arestigui,
killed when a shell hit his house in east Beirut on Sunday. His
body was flown Thursday to Madrid.
   The shelling duels, some of the heaviest in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war, erupted after Aoun blockaded Moslem
militia-run ports.
   Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet vying for power with a
rival Moslem government, was seeking to restore state authority
long eroded by powerful militias.
   The Druse Progressive Socialist Party, which operates two
illegal ports south of Beirut, retaliated by shelling the
Christian-held Beirut port. Syrian allies, who maintain 40,000
troops in Lebanon, joined and blockaded the Christians'
310-square-mile coastal enclave.
   More than 150,000 people have fled Beirut during earlier lulls
and more, driven as much by shortages as the fear of renewed
bombardment, packed up what they could Thursday and got out.
   Moslem refugees have moved south for sanctuary. But the
Christians have no place to hide in their enclave, every inch of it
within range of long-range Syrian artillery.
   The Christians' only exit is through the frequently shelled port
of Jounieh, where ferries leave for Cyprus.
   Even that escape route was in jeopardy. The two Cypriot
companies that run the ferries suspended service after the vessels
came under Moslem rocket fire.
   For those who stay behind, life has become a nightmare.
   Police and army explosives experts defused 300 unexploded shells
found in Moslem west Beirut on Thursday.
   It's not known how many more lie beneath the rubble of apartment
blocks, factories, schools, hospitals and stores.
   Both sides are suffering severe shortages _ fruit and vegetables
for the Christians, who normally get their supplies from Moslem
areas; bread for the Moslems, because flour warehouses are in
Christian territory.
   Both sides lack fuel because the main depot at Dora in east
Beirut was blown up by Syrian shellfire. The main power stations
shut down Saturday when fuel ran out for their generators.
   That knocked out the water pumping system, leaving homes dry and
fire crews unable to tackle burning buildings and cars set ablaze
in the shelling. Many people don't have water to wash off after
weeks in their shelters.
   The rubble-strewn streets are littered with stinking,
rat-infested piles of garbage. Municipal officials said the fuel
shortage meant garbage trucks couldn't run. And anyway, they said,
most of the 2,000 street cleaners have fled.
   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation reported that the French Navy
tanker Penhors, sent by Paris with a hospital ship on a
humanitarian mission, would unload its desperately needed cargo of
fuel oil within 24 hours.
   The radio said one third would be unloaded at the Moslem-run
power station at Jiye, south of Beirut, and the rest at the Zouk
plant in Christian territory north of the capital.
   With Moslems and Christian leaders bickering over who should get
the most fuel, most Beirutis won't believe the radio report until
their lights come on again.

<HEAD>`Godfather of Soul' James Brown Gives Jailhouse Interview</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soul singer James Brown has awed fellow inmates at
the State Park Correctional Center in South Carolina and is still
giving them autographs four months after his arrival, The Boston
Globe reported Thursday.
   Brown, 55, is serving a six-year sentence on a charge of
aggravated assault and failing to stop for police during a chase
across the George-South Carolina border that left his pickup
riddled with 26 bullets last Sept. 24.
   He is working on kitchen detail in the mornings. But in the
evenings, the fabled ``Godfather of Soul,'' whose gold records
include ``Please Please Please'' and ``Papa's Got a Brand New
Bag,'' is conducting the prison choir.
   ``They've come a long way since Mr. Brown took over,'' inmate
Gregory Harrison said.
   ``He seems to be doing all right to me. He mingles with the
fellas. It's real fascinating to me. I never thought I'd meet James
Brown in real life. I'm sorry it had to be in here.''
   ``I'd like to go back to gospel,'' Brown, a former gospel
singer, told the newspaper in an interview from the prison in State
Park, S.C. ``Really I never left. Or it never left me. The public
may not know it, but the Sex Machine first did it to death for the
Lord.''
   Brown sees a double standard in the fact that no politicians
have come to his aid. He said he went to Vietnam for Lyndon
Johnson, helped quell he riots in America in the 1960s, sang at
Richard Nixon's inauguration party and lent his fame to various
antidrug pronouncements.
   ``Politics and reality is so different now that reality doesn't
have anything to do with politics anymore,'' Brown said. ``All the
people in Watergate, they out of jail, now, right?''
   Brown's attorney, George Hill, has advised him to divorce his
fourth wife, Adrienne, who is due to stand trial shortly on drug
possession charges, thinking that a divorce might be a step to
earlier parole, the newspaper said. But Brown refused.
   ``I'm not going to court for a divorce,'' Brown said. ``I love
my wife.''

<TEXT>
   Farmland prices have gained another 6 percent
but are still far below the 1982 peak before they began their
five-year skid, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The department's Economic Research Service said that as of Feb.
1 the average value of U.S. farmland, including buildings, was $597
per acre, up from about $564 on Feb. 1, 1988.
   Farmland prices sank to a 19-year low of $548 per acre on Feb.
1, 1987, before gaining 3 percent last year.
   ``However, the 1989 value was still 27 percent below the record
$823 in 1982,'' the report said.
   Several factors were cited for the gain in farmland prices. Net
cash income of farmers in 1988 nearly matched the 1987 record, and
that buoyed confidence among prospective buyers that the
agricultural sector was working its way out of the crunch that
weighed on many farmers.
   Although producers hit by the 1988 drought experienced lower
crop yields, many grain producers, particularly those with
irrigation and those holding grain stocks from previous harvests,
benefited from sharply higher market prices, the report said.
   Federal drought aid also boosted farm receipts in 1988 an help
blunt the short-term impact. Higher cattle prices ``helped expand
cash receipts from livestock to record levels'' last year, the
report said.
   ``Values rose in all farm production regions except the Southern
Plains,'' the report said. ``Substantial gains in Pennsylvania,
Delaware and New Jersey led the 13 percent average (increase) in
the Northeast.''
   Although state average farmland prices were not immediately
available, the report said substantial gains also occurred in the
Corn Belt, up 10 percent, and the Northern Plains, 9 percent.
Further ``significantly higher'' values were reported in Iowa and
Nebraska.
   Land value increases in the Lake States, up 5 percent, and the
Southeast, up 7 percent, were said to be ``comparable to last
year,'' while a 6 percent increase in Appalachia was sharply higher
than the year before. A 3 percent in the value of farmland in the
Delta States was the first since 1981.
   ``Higher values in the Pacific region, 5 percent, and the
Mountain region, 1 percent, represented the first increases since
1984,'' the report said. ``The 5 percent drop in Texas more than
offset the 9 percent gain in Oklahoma, leading to an overall 2
percent decline for the Southern Plains.''

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa on Thursday lauded Pope John
Paul II as a ``great Pole'' who kept the Solidarity labor movement
alive, and knelt at his feet in an emotional reunion.
   The labor leader briefed the pope on the political accords in
Poland that led to the restoration of Solidarity's legal status on
Monday after nearly eight years of suppression by the communist
government.
   ``My batteries are recharged, and now I am ready to lift any
weight,'' Walesa said after the 30 minutes of private talks in the
pope's library.
   John Paul, who had given his warm endorsement of Solidarity
during Walesa's visit to the Vatican in 1981, said he was praying
for the success of the political reforms in his homeland.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro quoted the pope as saying he
hopes that Poland ``has a new possibility and that the
transformations in the social, political and economic life of the
entire society can take place.''
   About 10,000 students rallied in at least five Polish cities
Thursday to demand greater academic freedom and registration of the
still banned Independent Students Association, a Solidarity
spokesman and Poland's state radio reported.
   The association is due to gain restoration of its legal status
according to the round-table agreements reached on April 5.
   A Warsaw provisional court declared the independent farmers
union Rural Solidarity legal Thursday, three days after
relegalizing Solidarity.
   Thursday's meeting was the fourth meeting the pope and Walesa.
They also met during John Paul's pilgrimages to Poland in 1983, the
year Walesa won the Nobel Peace Prize, and 1987.
   During his visit in 1987, the pope stressed the need to keep the
spirit of Solidarity alive. The Soviet bloc's first independent
trade union was crushed by martial law in December 1981 and
outlawed in October 1982.
   The Roman Catholic Church is a major force in Poland and church
representatives participated in the negotiations that produced the
reforms.
   Earlier Thursday, visiting the Rome hospital where the pope was
treated after being shot by a Turkish gunman in 1981, Walesa said
Solidarity couldn't have survived without the pope's support.
   ``Here the life of Solidarity was saved because here the life of
a great Pole, the Holy Father, was saved,'' he said.
   ``One day history will say how important was the contribution of
this great Pole and this great man to the affirmations of the
ideals of Solidarity,'' Walesa said. ``I can't imagine my battle
and the life of Solidarity without the pope.''
   When he arrived at the pope's private library, he knelt at John
Paul's feet. The pope pulled him up and embraced him, saying, ``We
have to show how you greet the pope and how I greet you. I greet
you with all my heart.''
   After the private discussions, the two men were joined in the
library by Walesa's wife, Danuta, and five Solidarity aides and the
bishop of Gdansk, birthplace of Solidarity.
   Speaking later on Vatican TV, Walesa said the political and
economic reforms in the Soviet Union could be beneficial for the
rest of Eastern Europe.
   Monsignor Bronislaw Dabrowski, secretary general of the Polish
bishops' conference, spoke of the changes in Poland in the eight
years since Walesa's first visit to the Vatican.
   Today, he said, Polish union leaders are working with the
government to rebuild the country. ``In these years, the government
and the unions have matured.''
   Walesa, invited to Rome by Italy's trade union leaders, has said
he was seeking Western help for Poland's economic crisis. He met
with union leaders Thursday evening and will confer with top
government officials on Friday.
   During his visit to Gemelli Hospital, he blmed the Communist
government for Poland's ``economic disaster'' but said he is ready
to work with the government to overcome the difficulties.
   ``Poland wants to join Europe,'' he said. ``It is important to
translate the political victory into practical accomplishments.''
   Asked whether he would run in Poland's upcoming elections,
Walesa replied, ``No, I have other things to do, and there are
other candidates who are better.''
   The accords provide for a freely elected senate with veto power
over the existing single-chamber parliament. The legislature will
elect a president.

<HEAD>State Department Official Says U.S. Serious About Halting Driftnetting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard boarding of a Taiwanese ship
suspected of illegal drift-netting illustrates U.S. concerns over a
fishing technique that can wipe out huge numbers of sea creatures,
a top State Department official said Thursday.
   ``This is a very serious matter and it would be an
understatement to say this heightens the issue,'' said Ed Wolfe,
the State Department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries. ``The
U.S. position is there should be no drift-net fishing at all. It is
wasteful and inefficient.''
   An estimated 700 fishing boats from Taiwan, South Korea and
Japan have been using drift-nets in the northern Pacific Ocean to
catch squid since the early 1980s. The nets are up to 35 miles long
and can cover more than 30,000 square miles of ocean.
   U.S. fishermen charge the nets snare North American salmon and
the illegal catches have already impacted fish runs in Alaska,
Washington state and Oregon.
   As the episode in the north Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles
southwest of the Aleutian Islands unfolded over the past week,
Secretary of State James Baker III and Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger were involved in an effort to convince the
Taiwanese government to allow crewmen from the cutter Jarvis to
board the Cyi Yang No. 1.
   The Coast Guard was also exploring less diplomatic ways of
halting the vessel which was believed fleeing toward Taiwan after
abandoning its drift-nets. Those methods involve spraying water
down its smokestack, entangling its propellors or, as a last
resort, firing warning shots.
   Late Wednesday, the Taiwanese government decided to allow the
boarding, which took place without incident. But a representative
of the Taiwanese government made clear the granting of permission
to board would not be considered a precedent.
   The Jarvis was escorting the Taiwanese ship back to the area
where the incident began and U.S. aircraft were searching for the
abandoned drift-nets. The Coast Guard is looking for any evidence
that the nets from the Cyi Yang No. 1 had caught salmon.
   Northwest lawmakers have accused the drift-net fleets of
``stealing'' an estimated 10,000 metric tons of salmon worth an
estimated $21 million annually.
   The illegally caught fish are then ``laundered'' through fish
processors in Southeast Asia, where they are canned or frozen and
sold on international markets in direct competition with U.S. fish
products, the lawmakers have said.
   Environmentalists also claim the nets are responsible for the
deaths of thousands of porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine
life.
   Drift-net fishing has been limited to areas well away from the
migration routes of salmon.
   The Cyi Yang No. 1 was first spotted 450 miles outside the legal
fishing zone and in waters where the Taiwanese government itself
has banned driftnetting.
   The first contact between the two vessels came early Sunday when
the Cyi Yang No. 1 warned the Jarvis, about five miles away, that
it had drift-nets in the water.
   When the Jarvis identified itself as a U.S. vessel, the
Taiwanese ship cut its nets and fled. The Jarvis then began
shadowing the Cyi Yang No. 1, at times only several hundred feet
away, as the diplomatic negotiations began in Washington.
   The boarding took place almost 700 miles away from where the
incident began.
   Since Congress enacted a law in late 1987, the State Department
has been trying to negotiate drift-net monitoring and enforcement
agreements with Japan, Tawian and South Korea.
   If such agreements are not reached by June 29, the president can
then impose trade restrictions on the imports of fish products from
those countries.
   Last year, the United States imported $502 million worth of
edible and such no-edible fisheries products as pearls from Japan,
$282 million from South Korea and $445 million from Taiwan.
   Talks with the Japanese earlier this month broke off and Wolfe
said that while some progress has been made, ``it's not enough at
this point.''
   Wolfe said that the Taiwanese and Koreans have been essentially
``stonewalling'' efforts by the U.S. to negotiate an agreement,
though Wolfe is headed to Korea next week and expects talks with
the Taiwanese to resume later this spring.

<HEAD>First Multicandidate Elections Since 1946</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters on Thursday chose nine new
parliamentary deputies from 20 candidates _ the first time
Czechoslovak voters have had a choice in an election since 1946.
   The official news agency CTK gave scant details of the
elections, which have not been marked by any of the fervent
campaigning that accompanied last month's first multicandidate
elections in seven decades in the Soviet Union.
   Results were not expected before Friday.
   Regional organization of the Communist-dominated National Front
narrowed down the candidate list from 106 to 20 for the seats in
nine electoral regions, CTK said.
   It did not name any of the candidates, who must all be members
of the National Front, which includes all political parties and
official social organizations.
   Several of the elections were to replace parliamentarians who
resigned or were fired in a government shake-up in October.
   Seven of the districts are in Bohemia and Moravia, and two in
Slovakia, CTK said.
   A simple majority of 50 percent is required to win a seat, it
said.

<HEAD>Mourner Killed at Funeral Riot; Death Toll 8 as Riots Rage For 3rd

   Mourners rioted Thursday at the funeral of
a boy killed during protests of government price increases, and one
man died when police opened fire, residents said. Another report
said a policeman also was slain.
   Rioters pelted police with stones and burned several buildings,
including the house of a Mazar official accused by residents of
killing the boy, witnesses said.
   Violent demostrations were reported Thursday in several other
villages in southern Jordan. The latest killing raised the death
toll to at least eight in three days of unrest.
   Despite the widespread protests against Prime Minister Zaid
Ridai's austerity measures, there was no evidence of opposition to
King Hussein himself in the southern Jordan region that is
considered a bedrock of his strength.
   Several residents of this village 55 miles south of Amman said
members of Jordan's Bedouin Desert Police shot and killed Yacoub
Katawneh, 23, during the chaotic funeral of his cousin, 13-year-old
Ibrahim Katawneh.
   ``We had two burials. It was an awful scene. People shouted and
threw stones at police. Armed desert police shot live ammunition at
people,'' said one resident, who would not give his name.
   Officials in the nearby city of Kerak confirmed the two deaths.
   The officials, and several witnesses in the town, said a local
sub-governor allegedly killed the younger Katawneh and injured six
other people when he fired at a crowd of demonstrators who
approached his house Wednesday.
   One knowledgeable official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said one policeman died and another was injured in the Mazar
rioting on Thursday. Police did not confirm the report.
   Residents said rioters on Thursday burned an army supply depot,
a bank, a court building and the home of the official accused of
Wednesday's shootings.
   Twenty armored anti-riot vehicles stood at the entrance of the
village on the historic King's Highway, blocking the village to
outsiders.
   The unrest began Tuesday in Maan, 120 miles south of the
capital, when taxi drivers demonstrated against price rises in
gasoline and vehicle fees imposed Sunday as part of an agreement
with the International Monetary Fund.
   The protests spread to cities and villages throughout southern
Jordan, where incomes tend to be lower than those in the north.
   Eid Shihan, the Kerak district's police director, refused to
describe events in the area, but said they were ``blamed on
specific groups that we know and we will catch. The situation now
is calm. Everything is under control.''
   Black smoke, apparently from burning tires, rose into the sky
behind him.
   In the adjacent village of Mutah, reporters saw fire damage to a
bank and two government offices attacked on Thursday.
   Other witnesses said rioters burned cars, set up roadblocks and
set fire to government offices and banks in a string of small
villages north of Kerak, and in the town of Ghor Es-Safi south of
the Dead Sea.
   Government-run media have given no details of the rioting or
military action during the past three days, referring only to
``sorrowful incidents.''
   They reported Thursday that Hussein, visiting Washington, said
he believed ``everything is under control'' in the country, and
also have reported meetings between officials to discuss the
unspecified events.
   The declining value of the dinar during the past year has led
many prices to double while incomes have remained stable. Because
of the devaluation, per capita income has slipped to about $1,200 a
year from $2,000 a few years ago.
   ``Somebody who gets about 80 dinars ($148 a month) ... How do
you think he is going to pay for his cigarettes, his rent, for
commuting to work and buying food for his family?'' asked Nazih
Amari, who represented Kerak in Jordan's now-suspended Parliament.
   Jordan increased prices to help cut a government budget deficit.
Its agreement with the IMF is a prerequisite to rescheduling the
country's $6 billion debt.

<HEAD>Kemp Says Parental Role To be Considered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, who has
encouraged efforts to evict drug dealers and users from public
housing, said Thursday that authorities will have to consider the
role parents played in drug activity by their children before
evicting entire families.
   Kemp said that in some cases parents may be unable to control
older, physically strong children who are engaged in drug activity.
In those cases, he said, ``I don't think Mom and Dad should be
punished'' by eviction.
   But he said there are cases where mothers or other heads of
families are participants in drug enterprises, sometimes with their
children.
   ``Let the tenants and the PHAs (public housing agencies) throw
them out,'' Kemp said. ``On the first, first _ one, one _ time
you're caught doing, dealing, engaging in drug traffic, I would
say, out.''
   Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has offered to
drop HUD requirements that public housing agencies hold hearings
for tenants before they can be evicted for drug-related activity.
He said the hearings may be waived if local laws provide tenants
with due process in the courts.
   Kemp this week announced HUD actions aimed at further easing the
eviction process for local public housing agencies, which operate
federally subsidized housing projects. Among the steps HUD is
taking is to make illegal drug abuse or drug dealing a specific
violation of leases for HUD-subsidized housing.
   Kemp spoke at a seminar sponsored by Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo.,
for Colorado constituents.
   Asked how the eviction policy would be applied in cases of
families with children, Kemp said each case would depend on the
role of the parents.
   ``I think on a case-by-case basis you've got to find out whether
the parents were involved and knowingly allowed drugs to be either
sold or manufactured or dealt or used in that apartment, public
housing, or whether they were overcome by a situation,'' Kemp said.
   ``If they were overcome by the circumstances of having one of
their children involved without them having any culpability, I
would say they shouldn't lose their apartment,'' he said.
   ``If a mother, believe it or not, is involved in drugs, she
ought to be _ I don't want to make her homeless, but I don't want
her polluting public housing. And I've got a home for her or him or
whoever ... jail,'' he said.

<HEAD>Radio Moscow Solicits Israeli Investments In Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radio Moscow on Thursday solicited Israeli
investment in Soviet companies, saying the lack of diplomatic ties
between the two countries was not an obstacle to trade.
   The offer was made during the station's nightly 30-minute
Hebrew-language broadcast, said Israel radio monitor Mickey Gurdus.
   In the past, Radio Moscow has used the broadcasts mainly for
commentary sharply critical of the Jewish state.
   In the proposal presented Thursday, the radio station named a
Soviet company for foreign trade, Belka, and provided its address,
telephone and telex numbers in Moscow, Gurdus said.
   ``They said they are ready to initiate the contacts, and later
represent Israeli companies because it's quite expensive to
maintain offices in the Soviet Union,'' Gurdus said.
   ``They said they made the offer even though there are no
diplomatic ties, and are ready to discuss any offer,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union severed diplomatic ties after Israel captured
lands of Moscow's Arab allies during the 1967 Middle East war.
   In the past two years, relations have improved, mainly because
the Soviet Union hopes to play a greater role in the Middle East.
The two countries have swapped consular delegations and stepped up
cultural exchanges.

   The Soviet-backed government of Ethiopia asked
the United States to accept its ambassador in Washington in an
apparent move to upgrade relations, it was reported on Thursday.
   ``The Ethiopians have expressed an interest in improved
relations, a subject that has been under consideration by both
governments for some months,'' department spokesman Richard Boucher
told reporters.
   The spokesman said the United States was ``continuing to
review'' the request, but that nothing more had been decided.
   At present, the two countries are represented only by a charge
d'affaires in each other's capitals.
   An official familiar with developments in the African nation,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the request was made last
month.
   The Ethiopians asked to send Tibabu Bekelena, a diplomat who is
now the country's deputy foreign minister, as the ambassador, said
the official.
   It appeared unlikely that the United States would move quickly
on the request.
   The bid comes after more than a decade of poor relations between
the two nations that stemmed from the 1974 revolution that removed
Emperor Haile Selassie and brought Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile
Mariam and his leftist supporters to power.
   And due to congressional unhappiness with the human rights
situation in Ethiopia, economic assistance to the nation is barred.
   In its most recent report on human rights, the State Department
charged Ethiopia with a ``deplorable'' human rights record.
   Humanitarian aid, however, is allowed and last year the U.S.
government provided some $110 million in food, primarily to aid
those starving due to the conflict with rebel factions in the
northern provinces of Eritrea and Figure.

   The jury in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial
was dispatched Thursday to decide the guilt or innocence of the
former White House aide with the judge's admonition that no one,
including the president, had ``the legal authority to order anyone
to violate the law.''
   North has said he had authority from superiors including, he
believed, President Reagan, for many of his actions in behalf of
the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when official U.S. aid was banned.
   Because of the lateness of the hour, jurors were sent to the
nearby hotel where they will be sequestered, with orders to begin
deliberations on Friday.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell told them ``your job is to
decide the facts'' in the first trial stemming from the mid-1980s
affair in which profits from arms sales to Iran were diverted to
aid the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The judge was specific in his instruction about North's
contention that he acted under orders from top White House
officials and, he assumed, with Reagan's approval.
   ``Neither the president nor any of the defendant's superiors had
the legal authority to order anyone to violate the law,'' Gesell
said.
   ``You have heard testimony indicating that other government
officials may in some respects have concealed facts known to them,
and some ranking above or below the defendant may have engaged in
conduct similar to that charged against the defendant on trial.''
   But, he said, the conduct of others was no justification and
``you are not to judge defendant's guilt or innocence based solely
on the actions of others.''
   The judge's charge was delayed for a half day by a problem
involving jurors who may have given misleading answers in pre-trial
questioning. When he convened court in the afternoon, Gesell said
he had denied a North motion for a mistrial, filed on grounds that
``the jury had been infected by publicity about some of its
members.''
   The five alternates were dismissed after Gesell gave the
instructions.
   Gesell said North's defense that he was authorized to cover up
his secret Contra role may be considered, but under closely defined
circumstances.
   ``Authorization requires clear, direct instruction to act at a
given time in a given way,'' he said. ``It must be specific, not
simply a general admonition or vague expression of preference. It
must be sufficiently precise.''
   The most attentive person in the courtroom as Gesell read his
long instructions appeared to be North, whose eyes seldom left the
judge. Occasionally, the 47 year-old defendant would make a note on
a legal pad, writing with his left hand.
   North's wife and mother had been in the courtroom for much of
the morning's long wait, but they did not return in the afternoon
until the instructions had been read.
   Six of the charges involve withholding information from Congress
when it sought to find out about North's and the National Security
Council's role in supplying aid to the Contras.
   Conviction on each of those counts carries a maximum penalty of
five years in prison. Each of the 12 counts has a $250,000 penalty,
for a maximum of $3 million.
   North also is charged with obstructing a presidential inquiry,
making false statements when he was questioned by Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, and conspiring to defraud the United States
through illegal use of a tax-exempt foundation. Each of those
counts carries a 5-year penalty.
   One count of altering, destroying and concealing documents is
punishable by three years in prison; another, of accepting an
illegal gratuity _ a $13,800 security system _ is punishable by two
years. The remaining count, converting traveler's checks to his
personal use carries a 10-year maximum sentence.
   If convicted of all counts, North could be sentenced to a
maximum of 60 years in prison, but federal court practice is to
limit sentences to the longest on a single count _ in this case 10
years. Jurors also have the option of convicting North of aiding
and abetting in a crime rather than as the principal in seven of
the charges. The penalty would be the same as for conviction of the
full charge.
   Gesell had scheduled final instructions to the jury in the
morning, but instead remained in his chambers, apparently
requestioning some or all of the jurors and alternates.
   ABC News had reported that jurors Caswell G. Hartridge, 61, and
Helen G. Lynch, 37, had been named as defendants in civil suits
involving accidents in 1982.
   Both answered ``no'' on jury questionnaires asking whether they
had ``ever been involved as a party ... in any court proceedings
(civil or criminal).'' Both cases were settled out of court.
   ABC also reported that the first alternate juror, Joseph L.
Ward, 33, who answered ``no'' to the same question, had been
arrested in 1974 on a charge of sale and possession of narcotics.
He was placed on probation for a year, the network said. He also
was arrested in 1987 on a marijuana possession charge but wasn't
prosecuted, it said.
   In the jury room will be hundreds of pages of exhibits
introduced in the course of the trial, including a 42-page
``admission'' by the government of actions taken in behalf of the
Contras.
   The document summarizes events the government considered so
secret that it wanted no testimony about them in open court. Among
them is mention of a 1985 trip in which George Bush, then
vice-president, told the president of Honduras that nation would
receive expedited military and economic aid.
   That aid, according to other testimony, was part of an
arrangement for Honduras' allowing supplies to reach the Contras,
although there was no mention that Bush knew of the deal.
   Bush said Thursday that ``my conscience is clear'' about the
Iran-Contra affair, and he promised to cooperate with congressional
requests for unreleased Reagan administration documents.
   As before, he refused to comment directly on his role in the
affair.
   In final arguments to the jury Wednesday, defense lawyer Brendan
Sullivan declared that the government ``has not shown criminal
behavior'' by North. He concluded: ``I ask you to set him free.''
   But prosecutor John Keker said that even though North openly
admits lying to Congress and shredding evidence he has refused to
acknowledge that he did anything wrong. ``It's time for you to do
it for him,'' Keker told the jurors.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission awarded
a full-power operating license to the controversial Shoreham
nuclear power plant Thursday in a gesture that may ultimately prove
symbolic.
   The commission voted 4-0 to grant the license, capping years of
hearings that produced reams of testimony and cost millions of
dollars. It is the first U.S. nuclear plant to be licensed on the
basis of a utility-formulated emergency plan, rather than one
created by the state and local governments.
   After the vote, NRC Chairman Lando Zech told reporters that the
commission had fulfilled its duties without regard to the issue of
whether Shoreham would ever achieve full power.
   Asked if he thought it was a waste that the plant might never
operate, Zech said, ``As the chairman of the regulatory commission,
that's not my responsibility. As an American citizen, I would call
it a waste.''
   Richard Kessel, head of the State Consumer Protection Board,
called the license ``virtually meaningless.'' But Joseph McDonnell,
a Long Island Lighting Co. vice president, said the license is a
``prerequisite for establishing a national nuclear policy.''
   LILCO, which owns the 809-megawatt reactor, has agreed not to
bring the plant up to full power pending a vote by shareholders to
scrap the $5.5 billion plant.
   The vote, sometime before June 15, will make or break a deal
under which LILCO would sell Shoreham to New York state for $1 in
exchange for a decade of annual rate increases. The state would
then oversee the decommissioning and dismantling of the plant that
was once touted as the solution to Long Island's energy shortages.
   LILCO was forced to draw up its own emergency evacuation plan
after New York state, Suffolk County and the town of Southampton on
Long Island withdrew support for the plant, contending that the
zone around Shoreham could not be safely evacuated in case of an
accident, given Long Island's large population and the dearth of
roads leading away from the plant.
   The opposition kept Shoreham's bid for a license tied up before
the commission for years, and led the NRC to change its rules in
late 1987 to allow utilities to formulate evacuation plans assuming
state and local governments would cooperate in the event of a true
emergency. The same assumption is also being applied in the case of
the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear plant.
   At a hearing Monday, the NRC staff certified Shoreham safe and
ready to operate. The NRC's director of nuclear reactor regulation
said Long Island's geography, roads, climate and other features did
not ``render emergency planning at Shoreham fundamentally more
difficult than at other sites.''
   Even if the shutdown plan is ratified, Shoreham almost certainly
will not die quietly. Energy Secretary James Watkins has said that
to dismantle Shoreham ``would be utterly irresponsible,'' and the
department says it will try to block transferring Shoreham's
license to the Long Island Power Authority, an entity set up by the
state Legislature to take over the plant.
   Shoreham, located about 90 miles east of New York City, was
conceived in 1965 and completed in 1984, more than 10 years behind
schedule and almost 75 times over its original $75 million budget.
The plant loaded fuel in January 1985 and received a 5 percent
low-power testing license in July 1985.
   LILCO's applications for 25 percent and full-power licenses
stalled before NRC licensing boards and appeal boards as the state
and local governments contested countless aspects of emergency
planning.
   Last year, New York's Legislature formed the Long Island Power
Authority to attempt to take over the plant. LILCO defeated a LIPA
takeover bid last March but New York Gov. Mario Cuomo was
determined to see the plant closed. He negotiated a plan in May
under which LILCO would sell the plant to New York state for $1 in
exchange for guaranteed rate increases of about 70 percent over the
next 10 years. That plan fell apart, however, when the state
Legislature refused to vote on it before a Dec. 1 deadline.
   Later that month, a federal jury found LILCO guilty of
racketeering by lying to the state Public Service Commission in
order to win some $600 million in unjustified rate hikes in the
1970s. The company was faced with paying damages of roughly $1.8
billion, enough to bankrupt it.
   In February, LILCO agreed to a $400 million settlement of the
case _ $390 million to go to ratepayers and $10 million for
attorneys' fees.
   On Feb. 28, Cuomo announced that the state and LILCO had
negotiated a new settlement which did not require the Legislature's
approval. The second deal did not have built-in rate increases, but
the Public Service Commission set the hikes, of up to 5 percent a
year, when it approved the pact last month.
   The shareholders have the final say on the deal to scrap the
plan, and LILCO Chairman William Catacosinos has said the board
will recommend that they accept the deal.

<HEAD>Severe Thunderstorms Over Plains, Record Heat In Southwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms developed with hail and high wind Thursday
over the southern Plains, while temperatures in the Southwest
soared to record highs of as much as 102 degrees.
   Thunderstorms intensified late in the morning over southern
Kansas and northern Oklahoma.
   Hail as big as golf balls covered the ground near Anthony in
south-central Kansas, the National Weather Service said. Smaller
hail was reported in north-central Oklahoma.
   Wind gusted to 51 mph at Dalhart, in the Texas Panhandle, and
visibility was cut by blowing dust before a thunderstorm moved in.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across Florida,
especially over the southern part of the state. Light rain extended
across eastern sections of the Carolinas and into southern Georgia.
   Elsewhere, showers crossed sections of the upper Mississippi
Valley, and light rain fell along the coastal of the Pacific
Northwest.
   Unseasonably warm weather prevailed over much of the Southwest
with record high temperatures at a number of locations, and
temperatures on the Plains rose as high as 90 as far north as
Nebraska.
   Tucson, Ariz., had its earliest 100-degree reading on record
Wednesday when the temperature reached 101 degrees. On Thursday,
the city rose to a record 102 degrees, its 10th record this month.
   Other record highs Thursday were 77 at Alamosa, Colo., and 81 at
Colorado Springs, Colo. Denver tied its record of 83 and Pueblo,
Colo., tied its record of 90.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees at Grand Marais, Minn., to 102 at Tucson, Ariz. Thursday's
low for the 48 contiguous states was 22 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Friday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
across Florida, with showers over the northern and central
Appalachians. Showers and a few thunderstorms also were forecast
from the Pacific Northwest to the northern and central Rockies.
   Highs in the upper 40s and 50s were predicted over the Great
Lakes, New York state and New England; in the 60s along the Pacific
Coast and inland from the Northwest, and along the mid Atlantic
Coast and the central Appalachians; in the 90s over the
northwestrern half of Texas and southern New Mexico; in the 90s to
around 100 in the desert Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s across
most of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Presidential assailant John W. Hinckley Jr.,
giving his first public testimony, won court permission Thursday to
start negotiations to hire assassination buff Mark Lane as his
lawyer.
   ``It is my belief that I have the right to choose who will be my
attorney,'' Hinckley told U.S. District Judge June L. Green at a
hearing on his request to dismiss his longstanding defense team and
begin discussions with Lane.
   Green gave Hinckley permission to interview Lane and any other
prospective attorneys despite reservations expressed by officials
of a mental hospital where he has been held since he was acquitted
in 1982 by reason of insanity of shooting President Reagan and
three others in 1981.
   A psychiatrist at St. Elizabeths Hospital testified that
Hinckley still suffers from a serious mental illness and has been
moved from a dormitory-style room to a maximum-security ward
because he couldn't handle privileges he had previously enjoyed.
   Hinckley didn't identify Lane until the end of his testimony
when a hospital lawyer asked: ``Are you aware that in fact he has
written a number of books about political assassinations?''
   ``I know of one book he has written,'' Hinckley told hospital
attorney Janet L. Maher.
   ``What book is that?'' the judge interjected.
   ``Do you want me to just give this person's name because we are
going to lead into that?''
   When the judge indicated she wanted an answer, Hinckley said:
``He has written a book called `Rush to Judgment.' His name is Mark
Lane.''
   Lane's 1968 book, ``Rush to Judgment: A Citizen's Dissent,''
questioned the findings of the Warren Commission that Lee Harvey
Oswald acted alone when he killed President Kennedy in 1963.
   He has also written numerous articles, including a 1980 book
about the 1978 Jonestown massacre in Guyana.
   Maher, who argued that letting Hinckley interview prospective
lawyers ``presents a unique opportunity for exploitation,''
reminded Hinckley that Lane had written a number of books about
people he had represented in criminal cases.
   ``I don't think it's a crime that he's written these books and
interviewed these people,'' Hinckley said. ``I am sure that the
subjects he has written about at some point gave their consent.''
   ``I am capable of deciding whether I want my story told and it
is not the hospital's say to dictate whether I can do that,'' said
Hinckley, who spoke lucidly and appeared relaxed on the witness
stand.
   ``I should at least be permitted to talk to the man,'' Hinckley
said. ``If we don't get along, it stops right there.''
   Hinckley said that he wanted to hire Lane because ``he has
represented some people who are famous to the general public.''
These clients gained their noteerity ``as criminals, in the
criminal world,'' he added.
   Among Lane's clients was James Earl Ray, who shot the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 _ a fact Hinckley acknowledged
knowing. Lane represented Ray on an attempt to get a retrial of the
case.
   Earlier in his testimony, Hinckley said he had no money to hire
an attorney because he had depleted all the money in a fund set up
for him by his family to pay Vincent J. Fuller to defend him during
his 1982 trial.
   ``I am indigent now, but that doesn't mean that in the future
that I won't be able to make any money,'' Hinckley said.
   Dr. Raymond F. Patterson, testified that Hinckley was competent
to pick his own attorney.
   But Patterson expressed concern that people seeking to exploit a
connection with Hinckley would interfere with the treatment he is
receiving at St. Elizabeths.
   A psychiatrist who until recently has treated Hinckley since
1982, Patterson testified that he ``continues to have difficulty in
his judgment'' and has ``difficulty learning from his past
experience.''
   He can't ``differentiate famous from infamous,'' Patterson said.
``He does not have a clear perception of how he is seen by others.''
   ``He has had to resume a higher level of restriction,''
Patterson said. At one point, Hinckley was living in a
dormitory-style room and in late 1986 hospital authorities allowed
him to spend time during the Christmas holidays with his family at
a townhouse in suburban Virginia.
   A request for a similar weekend visit over the Easter holiday
the next year was met with strong opposition by the Secret Service,
which wasn't formally told of the Christmas visit.
   The hospital dropped its request after prosecutors produced
evidence that Hinckley had corresponded with serial killer Ted
Bundy, who was executed earlier this year in Florida.
   The hospital also abandoned plans to take Hinckley on an outing
with other patients last summer after another cache of writings was
found in his room.
   Patterson said Hinckley was placed in a maximum-security ward
because he had ``difficulty handling the privileges'' previously
given to him.
   Hinckley was acquitted in 1982 by reason of insanity of shooting
Reagan, then-presidential press secretary James Brady, a Washington
police officer and a Secret Service agent. The shooting has left
Brady partially paralyzed.
   After the hearing, Fuller, saying he thought Hinckley did well
as a witness, said he was glad to be off the case. ``I am
relieved.''
   ``He wanted new counsel, he's entitled to it. I did not want to
stand in his way.''

<HEAD>Soviets Dropping Four Nuclear Power Plant Projects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will stop work on two nuclear
power plants and add safety systems at 14 existing plants to head
off further disasters like the Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion
and fire, Tass said Thursday.
   The Soviet news agency said work is being halted on two new
reactors in Smolensk and Kursk in central Russia that use the same
graphite-core design as the Chernobyl plant in the Ukraine, Tass
said.
   The report seemed to contradict official statements in 1987 that
no more graphite reactors would be built following the April 26,
1986, accident at Chernobyl, which killed 31 people and scattered
bits of nuclear reactor as far as Poland.
   Tass also said the Council of Ministers formally scrapped plans
to build two more reactors at Chernobyl. Authorities said two years
ago no more generators would be built at the disaster site.
   The agency quoted Vladimir Maryin, deputy chairman of the Fuel
and Energy Bureau, as saying all 14 nuclear power plants built in
the 1970s would be refitted to ensure cooling during emergencies
and to contain radiation leaks.
   Soviet nuclear plants do not have containment domes as American
plants do, and experts said their design prevents such domes from
being added now. Tass did not explain what kind of containment
system is planned.
   Maryin, interviewed by the newspaper Pravitelstvenni Vestnik, or
Government Herald, said researchers have begun work on a new
reactor design they hope to complete by the mid-1990s.
   ``The main goal is to develop plants with built-in safety
features that will make them invulnerable to equipment failures or
human error,'' he said.
   In December, Soviet officials said that six nuclear power
projects were scrapped because of earthquake danger or tougher
standards imposed because of Chernobyl. On March 18, the government
permanently closed an Armenian nuclear power plant after a
devastating earthquake hit only 25 miles away.
   After Chernobyl, a public outcry rose for all such nuclear power
stations to be shut down, but Soviet authorities refused to do so.
The three remaining reactors at Chernobyl continue to operate
despite the difficulty of protecting the staff from radiation
contamination.

   A Navy
commander who was aboard the USS Iowa during the explosion inside a
gun turret said Thursday the Navy has imposed a moratorium on
firing 16-inch guns pending an investigation of the disaster.
   Vice Adm. Jerome Johnson, commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet,
praised his crew for ``their sensitivity and heroic effort'' during
the disaster Wednesday.
   The coffins of the 47 sailors who died in the explosion were
saluted by an honor guard, then carefully loaded each onto a cargo
plane as the dead began their final trip home.
   The sailors' remains were airlifted by helicopter from the Iowa,
anchored offshore from this base on Puerto Rico's eastern coast, to
a temporary morgue in a hangar beside the airstrip. The harbor was
too shallow for the ship to dock at the base.
   From there, each metal coffin was wrapped in a U.S. flag and
then taken by van to the cavernous rear door of the plane. The
camouflaged C-5 Galaxy cargo plane then left for Dover, Del.
   The 47th coffin was met at the rear of the plane by a Navy and
Marine Corps color guard of two men with rifles and three bearing
the U.S., Navy and Marine flags.
   Standing in the 86-degree heat, an eight-man honor guard of
sailors in white dress uniforms saluted each coffin as it arrived,
and then, serving as pallbearers, lifted the coffins into the huge
cargo hold.
    Johnson said the death toll was based on a roll call after the
accident.
   ``There are 47 missing or dead,'' Johnson said. ``We are in the
process of identification of the bodies.'' He said relatives would
be notified before a list was made public.
   He said the accident occurred during the loading of the number
two turret during a routine gun practice Wednesday and the fire was
contained within two hours. He did not estimate the extent of the
dollar damage to turret, but he said the rest of the ship escaped
harm.
   ``I can tell you the fire and explosion was instantaneous.
Because it was instantaneous, we have no other injuries,'' Johnson
said at a Roosevelt Roads news conference.
   Eleven crewmen inside the turret escaped, from a magazine area
at the bottom of the seven-story-high turret, he said.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Urges End to Violent Protests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung
urged workers and students Thursday to end violent protests to
avoid a government crackdown and the curtailment of democratic
reforms.
   Thousands of students hurling rocks and firebombs staged violent
protests in Seoul and three other cities to demand the ouster of
President Roh Tae-woo.
   In Seoul, isolated clashes erupted outside four universities _
Dongkuk, Korea, Dangkuk and Joong-ang _ after riot police blocked
2,500 demonstrators from marching out of their schools.
   Kim told a news conference he was concerned that rightists in
the government and security forces were pressuring President Roh
Tae-woo to take a tough line against opposition groups.
   ``I solemnly warn that President Roh will not be able to avoid a
big misfortune, not only for the people but also for himself, if he
continues to push only suppression,'' said Kim, leader of the Party
for Peace and Democracy.
   He urged workers and students not to stage violent protests,
saying violence alienated public opinion and gave government
hardliners an opportunity to clamp down.
   The government has expressed concern that a wave of labor
strikes and student protests could seriously disrupt the economy
and create political unrest. Roh has warned the government will
suppress groups that stage violent protests.
   But the government said Thursday it would not block peaceful
protests, and the Cabinet issued instructions allowing orderly
anti-government demonstrations in designated areas in Seoul and
other major cities.
   The regulations oblige protesters to obtain police permission
for their plans, including slogans that would be shouted at the
protests.
   Thousands of anti-government students clashed with riot police
in Seoul and nine other cities Wednesday to push for Roh's
downfall. Police said Thursday that 455 protesters had been
arrested and 344 protesters and police officers were hurt.
   Radical students and dissidents frequently stage violent
anti-government protests, but they lack popular support because of
their violent tactics and extremist views.
   In another development Thursday, national security agents
detained two senior journalists in connection with their
newspaper's alleged plan to send reporters to communist North Korea
without government approval.
   Managing editor Chang Yoon-hwan and development executive Chung
Tae-gee of the opposition Hankyoreh Shinmun were placed in the
custody of the Agency for National Security Planning, the main
government intelligence organization.
   Government officials said the two journalists would be
questioned on their alleged role in the newspaper's plan to send
reporters to cover North Korea in May or June.
   The newspaper said the plan had been considered but never was
formally decided on. All South Koreans must get prior government
approval for a visit to North Korea.
   The government investigators have 24 hours to decide whether to
file formal charges.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A piece of razor blade, bits of glass, thumbtacks
and caustic soda have been found in jars of baby food in southern
England, police said Thursday.
   They said the five incidents involved jars of pureed baby food
made by H. J. Heinz Co. and occurred over a nine-day period between
April 7 and 15.
   ``Whoever is responsible must have a very sick mind,'' said a
company spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said Heinz was certain the tampering was taking place outside
its British premises, where it produces 96 million jars of baby
food a year. The company knew of no person or group with a grudge
against it, he added.
   In Oxford, police said a 9-month-old girl chewed on a piece of
razor blade concealed in pear-flavored yogurt and was treated at a
hospital for a cut mouth.
   Inspector David Wise of Thames Valley Police said a warning
stamped on rolled-up plastic tape was found in the bottle but the
police would not reveal the message while the hunt continued for
the perpetrator.
   ``The warning indicated that the contents of the bottle were
contaminated. The chain store where it was bought has withdrawn all
similar bottles from sale and recalled those that were sold,'' Wise
said.
   Police said the first incident was at Rayleigh, east of London,
where a mother found two thumbtacks, caustic soda and a warning
tape in a chicken and vegetable puree. The other finds were on the
south coast, two in Southampton and one in Worthing.

<HEAD>Bush Meets Republicans on Gun Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday he is still
trying to establish which guns have ``suitability for sporting
purposes'' as he puts together an anti-crime proposal.
   As Bush weighed what to include in his package, a group of
Republican lawmakers urged him to concentrate more on criminals
than gun control.
   Bush met with the group seeking ideas on what should result from
his administration's review of uses of assault weapons, which have
proliferated among street criminals and drug dealers.
   The lawmakers urged him to look beyond new regulation of weapons
and focus instead on construction of prisons and incarceration of
criminals to deal with ``a national crime emergency,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who was joined in the meeting with Bush by
Sens. James McClure, R-Idaho, and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Rep.
Bill McCollom, R-Fla.
   Bush told reporters that he was talking to ``a wide array of
people on this.''
   He said he had reached no decision yet on what to do about
assault weapons, but added, ``Our package will be _ I guarantee it
will include more on law enforcement.''
   ``I guarantee Bill Bennett will be totally on board,'' he added
in reference to his drug policy coordinator who is reported to have
urged stricter controls on semi-automatic weapons.
   Bush spoke highly of an opinion he had sought from the head of
the conservative Heritage Foundation as to how to balance the
public's concerns about violent crime with the rights of
law-abiding gun owners. But Bush did not say specifically what he
liked about it.
   ``He called Ed Feulner up and asked him for his thoughts,'' said
Heritage spokesman Herb Berkowitz.
   The spokesman said only that the memorandum in response ``tried
to walk a careful, fine line between our constitutional and civil
libertarian views'' and the need to address the crime issue.
   Bush raised the ire of some gunowners in mid-March when he
announced suspension on imports of semi-automatic assault rifles so
that the administration could review whether they were being used
only for sporting purposes as is required by law. No similar ban on
sales of domestically manufactured weapons, many of which are
virtually identical to the imports, has been implemented.
   Gun control advocates are pushing for an expansion of the ban to
the domestic market, citing an escalation in street killings and
deaths of innocent bystanders. But opponents argue that such action
would impede the rights of law-abiding hunters.
   Specter, after meeting with Bush, said he anticipates the
president will come out with ``a major crime initiative in the
course of the next several weeks.''
   The crime package is expected to include provisions on assault
weapons.
   In the meantime, Bush is soliciting opinions from a wide variety
of sources, said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   ``He's reaching out and talking to a lot of people on this issue
while the review is going on,'' she said. The review is being
conducted by the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms. The agency has distributed a questionnaire to a
variety of gun owners, organizations, manufacturers and gun-control
advocates, said Ms. Glen.
   ``The standards that are set up in existing law about import are
`suitability for sporting purpose.' And we're being very careful
here, but we're gong to make a determination using that as a
standard,'' Bush told reporters.
   Various congressional bills in the works deal with gun control
issues.
   Specter said he is confident a definition can be developed that
will separate assault weapons from legitimate semiautomatic hunting
weapons.
   But McClure said he does not believe that is possible.
   He is proposing legislation to require a criminal-record check
of gun purchasers, but he does not favor requiring any waiting
period to conduct the check. He said a nationwide computerized
system must be set up using law enforcement data that gun sellers
would have access to.
   Gramm, Specter and McClure said they advocated a heightened
emphasis on prison construction and alternative jail ideas. Gramm
suggested using the National Guard for construction of temporary
prisons on military bases.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says a major
agricultural subsidy called the Export Enhancement Program has not
been suspended, but a farm state senator said Thursday that's not
how it appears to him.
   ``We maintain that a suspension is in place,'' said Sen. Robert
Kerrey, D-Neb., in a letter to the Office of Management and Budget.
   He said that while a new wheat initiative under the program is
pending at the budget office, officials there have instructed the
Department of Agriculture not to send them completed documents
proposing sales under the program for other commodities such as
vegetable oil, rice and broilers, until the administration
completes a broad review.
   A spokeswoman at the budget office said the program has not been
suspended and that two applications have been processed this year.
The spokeswoman, who spoke only on condition she not be quoted by
name, said she did not know how many applications were awaiting
processing.
   She said a meeting would be held in about two weeks to review
the effectiveness of the program.
   The Export Enhancement Program subsidizes U.S. commodity sales
overseas to make them less expensive for foreign buyers.
   Kerrey said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter gave
assurances that it was not suspended while it underwent a general
review.
   Kerrey called the program ``perhaps the single most effective
tool for securing progress in trade negotiations'' and urged Budget
Director Richard Darman to ``end the EEP suspension now in place.''
   Earlier in the week, Thomas O. Kay, administrator of the U.S.
Foreign Agricultural Service, told a Senate subcommittee that the
program was no longer ``budget neutral'' and that the budget office
had ordered it suspended.
   ``All that is at issue at the moment is any future allocations
that might be made'' under the program, Yeutter said earlier this
week. Those will be considered on a case-by-case basis ``primarily
because of our stocks (of grain) condition and the weather
conditions that now prevail.''

<HEAD>Thais Say Cambodian Refugee Camps Attacked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thai sources said Thursday that
Vietnamese-backed forces have been pounding Khmer Rouge refugee
camps near the Cambodian border with heavy artillery fire, but the
secretive guerrilla organization has refused to allow evacuation of
its wounded.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
shelling had caused many casualties, and the refugees had been
driven deeper into Thailand.
   As many as 4,000 shells fired from inside Cambodia crashed into
a wide area along Thailand's eastern Trat province on Monday and
Tuesday, and more landed the following day, the military and other
sources said on condition of anonymity. The area was reported quiet
on Thursday.
   ``They just covered the whole area with shells,'' one source
said.
   They said the areas struck included the U.N.-aided camp of Ta
Luan, which housed about 6,000 refugees, and Kaiche, a nearby camp
where the Khmer Rouge have not allowed Western access but where
10,000 or more civilians were believed held.
   Thousands of the refugees sought shelter deeper inside Thailand,
including about 2,000 who fled from Kaiche to Ta Luan, sources
said. Ta Luan is a few miles inside Thailand.
   The sources quoted the fleeing Cambodians as saying they
witnessed others killed or wounded, but no overall count was
possible. In Ta Luan, at least several wounded people, some
seriously hurt, were inside houses and underground shelters. Some
evidently were moved there from a camp hospital because there were
no shelters near the hospital, sources said.
   Thai military sources said more than 100 houses in Ta Luan were
destroyed. Other sources said the artillery and rocket rounds
carved craters there and outside the camp.
   A military source said many Thais were evacuated from villages
in the area but that a 56-year-old man was killed.
   The Khmer Rouge have not sent any wounded to Thai hospitals or
to the border hospital of the International Red Cross. Officials
have said the Khmer Rouge fear that these people will defect if
they are allowed outside the camps.
   Urs Boegli, head of the Red Cross delegation in Thailand, said
after visiting the stricken area: ``The (Red Cross) is very
concerned and is negotiating with the Thai government to find a
solution for these people in danger, and in particular to be able
to evacuate the wounded to the hospital at Khao-I-Dang, which was
set up for exactly this kind of emergency.''
   A military source said Thai authorities were considering
evacuating the Cambodians at Ta Luan to a safer site.
   Widespread human rights abuses have been reported in refugee
camps in Thailand run by the communist Khmer Rouge, which killed
hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled Cambodia in 1975-78
and attempted to implement a radical agrarian revolution.
   The Khmer Rouge now is the strongest of three guerrilla groups
fighting Vietnamese forces that invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and
the forces of the Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh government.
   A Thai military source speculated that either Vietnamese or
allied Cambodian government forces forces shelled the Ta Luan area
to hurt the Khmer Rouge as much as possible before Vietnam's
promised troop pullout, which is to be completed by Sept. 30.
   The area of the shelling includes major guerrilla strongholds.
   Other sources said the attack may have been aimed at detering a
renewed Khmer Rouge scheme to relocate people from Ta Luan to
Kaiche and other areas closer to the Cambodia border for military
purposes.
   Vietnamese leader Nguyen Van Linh reportedly flew to Moscow
Thursday for talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Vietnam's
planned military pullout from Cambodia.
   Accompanying Linh on the four-day visit was Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach, the country's main negotiator on the Cambodian
issue, Japan's Kyodo News Service reported from Hanoi, the
Vietnamese capital.

   The Air Force Logistics Command has
temporarily grounded its fleet of subsonic, single-engine attack
aircraft, citing small cracks found in the trailing edges of wings,
the Pentagon said Thursday.
   The fleet of 365 A-7D and K model aircraft used by the Air Force

   The cracks were discovered during routine maintenance by the Air

   The A-7 Corsair II was originally designed for the U.S. Navy.
The A-7D model of the aircraft, designed for the Air Force
primarily for an air-to-surface attack role, has been in service
since December 1968. Production ended in December 1976.
   The A-7K model, a two-seat version of the A-7D, has been used in
combat operations and training.

<TEXT>
   A revised congressional estimate suggests the
government may be collecting more in taxes than had been previously
projected in Medicare's program to cover catastrophic illnesses,
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said Thursday.
   The Texas Democrat, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,
wrote to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to ask whether the
Treasury Department agrees with revised estimates by the
Congressional Budget Office and legislative tax staff experts that
the government will have $4.9 billion available in excess funds in
1989-93.
   ``The Congressional Budget Office concludes that the surplus in
the catastrophic care funds is twice as large as originally
estimated; two times bigger than needed to provide adequate reserve
and contingency margins,'' Bentsen told reporters.
   ``According to preliminary estimates this would mean a cut of at
least 16 percent in the supplemental premium revenue'' could be
made, said Bentsen.
   The law requires everyone eligible for Medicare who pays at
least $150 a year in federal income taxes to pay an extra premium
based on that tax liability, with the maximum such supplemental
premium this year of $800 per beneficiary _ or $1,600 per couple,
if both spouses are eligible for Medicare.
   Bentsen's letter suggested that the cap on the supplemental
premium could be reduced to $500 for this year if the revenue
estimates are correct.
   Lawmakers have been flooded with mail from the elderly
protesting the tax paid by beneficiaries. Bentsen said that ``it
was never our intention that the beneficiaries pay more than needed
to operate this program in a prudent, responsible fashion.''
   ``This could be potentially good news for Medicare beneficiaries
particularly for those paying the supplemental premium,'' said
Horace Deets, executive director of the American Association for
Retired Persons.
   ``AARP always believed that the benefits in the catastrophic
health care law were important to older Americans. We're even more
delighted to hear that beneficiaries may pay less for the expanded
Medicare coverage,'' Deets added.
   ``There are two reasons for us to interpret this as
encouraging,'' said Eric Shulman, legislative director for the
National Council of Senior Citizens.
   ``One is that hopefully this new revenue will yield tangible and
significant reduction in premiums. The other is that it may open
the door to some reconsideration of the financing mechanism,'' said
Shulman.

   Pallbearers carried the
flag-draped coffins through an honor guard of enlisted men Thursday
as the remains of battleship sailors killed on the USS Iowa arrived
to be prepared for burial.
   The Navy Band played ``The Navy Hymn'' and ``America The
Beautiful'' while the 47 caskets were unloaded from the big C-5A
Galaxy cargo jet and carried into a hangar where a brief ceremony
was held.
   Navy Secretary William L. Ball III appeared for President George
Bush and said the president, who served in the Navy during World
War II, ``knows the special agony which is like no other that
attends the loss of a shipmate.
   ``The sacrifice made by these men is a jolting reminder of the
dangers faced by those who freely make that choice and serve at
sea,'' Ball said.
   Ball said he hoped the sailors go to their graves ``certain in
the knowledge that a grateful nation will not forget _ that we find
their pride in themselves to be hard-earned and well-deserved.''
   At the end of the ceremony, the band played ``Taps,'' and Ball
knelt on one knee before a casket to say a brief prayer.
   Families of the victims did not attend, but nine Iowa crew
members who had accompanied the remains to Dover were sitting among
military officials. More than 100 Air Force personnel also paid
respects to the dead.
   The Navy had publicly identified 43 of the victims by Thursday
evening.
   The remains arrived at 4 p.m. on a huge C5 military cargo jet
from Roosevelt Roads Naval Base, Puerto Rico, where the bodies were
placed in metal coffins and each coffin was wrapped in the Stars
and Stripes.
   Cmdr. Mark Neuhart, a Navy spokesman, said a memorial service
would be held next week in Norfolk, Va., the ship's home port.
   The sailors were killed Wednesday when bags of gunpowder ignited
inside a gun turret holding three of the Iowa's 16-inch guns. The
explosion occurred during a gunnery exercise while the 46-year-old
ship was on maneuvers about 330 miles northeast of Puerto Rico.
Neuhart said such exercises have been suspended until further
notice.
   Eleven crewmen escaped from inside the turret, and 10 to 12
crewmen suffered minor injuries while fighting the fire, the Navy
said. There were 1,600 crewmen aboard the ship.
   The bodies were sent to Dover because it houses the largest
military mortuary, operated by the Defense Department to handle the
remains of military personnel and dependents who die in Europe, the
Azores and Greenland.
   It also has handled remains of sailors killed aboard the USS
Stark in May 1987, Marines killed in a terrorist bombing in Beirut
in October 1983 and the remains of military personnel and
dependents killed in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am flight 103
over Scotland.
   Base spokesman Capt. Walter Thorp said he could not estimate how
long it would take before the remains would be transferred to the
victims' hometowns for burial.

   The bodies of 47 sailors killed in the gun
explosion on the Iowa arrived in the United States on Thursday as
the Navy tried to figure out what caused the battleship's turret to
blow up.
   None of the guns in the no. 2 turret had been fired before the
explosion instantly killed the seamen, Navy officials said. They
discarded a theory that the blast had been sparked by red-hot
debris left in the gun's breech by earlier rounds.
   The Navy organized a board of inquiry and placed a moratorium on
firing 16-inch guns, found only on the Iowa and its three sister
battleships, the New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.
   The Iowa was headed back to its home port at Norfolk, Va., while
the bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at Dover
Air Force Base in Delaware and families of the battleship's 1,600
crewmen waited to learn whether their relatives were among the dead.
   At the White House, chief of staff John Sununu announced
President Bush will attend a memorial service Monday for the
victims in Norfolk. He said the president had heard of the service
and told his staff ``if it could be fitted in, he wanted to be
there ... wants to be a part.''
   The blast occurred Wednesday morning northeast of Puerto Rico as
the Iowa took part in firing exercises that were part of naval
training.
   A spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet and the ship's former captain
both said the explosion in the No. 2 turret could have been
triggered by red-hot debris from earlier firings in the three-gun
turret.
   But Cmdr. Mark Baker, chief of the Navy's Pentagon press office,
said later that none of the turret's three guns had been fired.
   Only four rounds of 22 scheduled to be fired as part of a
training exercise had been fired, he said, and all had been from
the No. 1 turret, forward of the one that exploded.
   No eyewitnesses survived Wednesday's explosion behind one of the
16-inch guns on the Iowa, one of the largest warships ever.
   Pentagon officials declined to speculate publicly about the
exact cause of the disaster, the worst to strike a Navy ship since
1977, but two officers _ Capt. Paul Hanley, a fleet spokesman, and
Capt. Larry Seaquist, the ship's former captain _ said a possible
explanation was that red-hot debris from a previous round ignited
new charges.
   But Seaquist stressed, ``We simply do not know what caused that
powder to go.''
   Baker said no guns in the No. 2 turret had been fired and the
order had just been given to the No. 2 turret crew to load and
prepare the center gun when the explosion occurred.
   ``We have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired,'' Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters as he headed back to
Washington from a NATO meeting in Brussels.
   The Iowa sailed to Roosevelt Roads Navy Base in Puerto Rico to
unload the bodies, which were then flown to Delaware. Navy
investigators boarded the ship as it left for Norfolk, where it is
expected to arrive Sunday or Monday.
   Navy Secretary William Ball attended a memorial service at the
Delaware base, home of the armed services' largest mortuary. The
flag-draped coffins were carried off a plane by Navy honor guards.
   Around the United States, Navy officers and chaplains broke the
bad news to the dead men's next of kin.
   The job began just before midnight Wednesday, when officials in
Norfolk received the list of the dead.
   ``I've done it many times and I'll never get used to it,'' said
Cmdr. Doug Palmer, acting chaplain for the Norfolk Navy Base. Five
men had families in the Norfolk area.
   The commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet, Adm. Jerome Johnson, who
was on board the Iowa, told reporters in Puerto Rico, ``The fire
and explosion was instantaneous.''
   Cheney indicated the casualties were all in the swiveling gun
house at the top of the turret, rather than the mechanical
compartments and ammunition magazines below it.
   Eleven men escaped from powder magazines deep within the ship at
the base of the turret. A dozen crew members suffered minor
injuries fighting the fire caused by the explosion. They were
treated and returned to duty, said Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman.
   At the White House, President Bush brushed aside suggestions
that the explosion was due to the age of the Iowa, a World War II
leviathan brought out of mothballs during the military buildup of
the Reagan administration.
   Asked about the ship's safety, Bush said he wanted to insure
that procedures were checked ``to be sure that safety is at the
highest point ... but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that
because that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that way
that makes a useful platform obsolete.''
   Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey,
began the board of inquiry's investigation. Hoffman said he could
not predict when the investigation would be completed.
   Seaquist told reporters, ``It seems from the reports that those
powders exploded.'' He referred to the six 110-pound sacks of
powder rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-pound
shell.
   Seaquist said a pressurized air system that clears debris from
the breech at a gun's rear must be operated manually. Each gun has
a one-inch diameter tube carrying air under 3,000 pounds of
pressure to blow debris from the 62-foot barrel.
   The only officer killed was Lt. j.g. Phillip Edward Buch from
Las Cruces, N.M., who would normally be in a small compartment at
the rear of the swivelling top of the turret, adjacent to the room
in which shells are loaded.
   Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion can
occur if a gun breech is cracked, or from a shell that ``cooks
off'' _ ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel or
smoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round.
   ``The first thing that comes to mind is something like a
cook-off,'' said Hanley. ``It could have been a bag or a
projectile. We just don't know yet.''
   None of the four battleships of the Iowa class, which saw
service in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, has ever
sustained such an explosion, Pentagon officials said.
   Wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for the
Navy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died when
a launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton was
struck by a Spanish freighter.
   Except for two World War II Japanese battleships and the current
Navy aircraft carriers, the 58,000-ton ships of the Iowa class are
the largest warships in the world.

   A 5-year-old girl who lost her hand to a
pipe bomb explosion at a K mart is being showered with hundreds of
gifts, letters and calls. And she has begun to smile again, her
mother said Thursday.
   Erin Bower also received some good news from doctors at
Methodist Hospital who said she may regain partial vision in her
left eye, which was ripped open by the blast. She was listed in
fair condition.
   ``Erin's doing very well today. I prayed so hard for her,'' said
her mother, Maureen Bower, her voice breaking and her eyes filling
with tears at a hospital news conference.
   A bomb concealed in a pump-type toothpaste dispenser blew up
when Erin grabbed it during a shopping trip with her parents Monday
night at a K mart department store in Indianapolis.
   Four fingers and half of the left hand were blown off in the
explosion, and the remainder of the hand was amputated Tuesday. The
explosion also left flash burns on her stomach.
   ``We have not come right out and told her that her hand is not
there. She's beginning to put it all together,'' Mrs. Bower said.
   ``We just told her that what happened wasn't very nice. She
said, `Yeah,' but she said she's going to get better.''
   Mrs. Bower, her husband, Kevin, and another daughter, 1-year-old
Megan, have been overwhelmed by hundreds of calls, letters and
gifts from around the country that have swamped them since tiny,
blond-haired Erin was injured.
   ``It's just incredible. We can't thank everybody enough for the
sympathy, the help and the encouragement we've received,'' Mrs.
Bower said.
   Although Erin remains in a lot of pain from her hand and stomach
injuries, she has enjoyed her favorite drink, chocolate milk, and
is starting to smile again, her mother said.
   ``I told her that there was lots of mail and she keeps telling
me not to open it up, that when she's able to she wants to open it
all,'' Mrs. Bower said.
   Police, meanwhile, released a third sketch of a person wanted
for questioning in the case, but reported no solid leads.
   The white male bought a box of Crossman brand BB pellets at the
K mart three days before the bombing, said Charles A. Petersen, an
agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in
Indianapolis.
   ``The person most probably is not involved in the incident, but
we would very much would like to talk to him in an effort to
eliminate him and pursue other investigative avenues,'' Petersen
said.
   No individual or group has claimed responsibility for placing
the device in the store.
   ``It took some skill, thought and time to assemble it the way
they did, and some imagination,'' Petersen said. ``It doesn't seem
to be directed at an individual because of where it was placed.''
   Erin was put under anesthesia Thursday so physicians could
examine her eye. Doctors said more surgery may be necessary to
remove the large amount of blood in it.
   ``I'm confident she'll have some vision, but I'm not sure just
how much,'' said William Nunery, an ophthalmic plastic surgeon who
operated on Erin. ``She has light perception. We're happier now
than we were a few days ago.''
   Nunery said the eye examination will be repeated in a few days
and Erin could be released in a week.
   First National Bank, where Mrs. Bower is an assistant vice
president, announced a $10,000 reward Thursday for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. A trust
fund for Erin was also established by the bank.
   K mart has been criticized by police and others for not offering
more than a $5,000 reward for the information. Several Indianapolis
radio stations are collecting money for various rewards.

   The U.S. government on Thursday
donated 11,000 bottles of purple ink to be used to prevent voters
from casting more than one ballot in national elections set for May
1.
   The donation, made through the Agency for International
Development, followed a request from the Paraguayan government.
Opposition politicians had cited widespread election irregularities
during the 34-year rule of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
   In February 1988, when Stroessner was elected to his eighth
presidential term, the number of votes in favor of the ruling
Colorado Party exceeded the number of registered voters in 39 of
220 districts.
   The May 1 presidential and congressional elections are the first
since Stroessner was toppled in a coup Feb. 3 by Gen. Andres
Rodriguez.
   ``This is a donation from the government of the United States
for the benefit of national democracy,'' said Electoral Board
president Expedito Rojas at a ceremony attended by representatives
from seven of the eight parties participating in the election.
   The purple dye lasts on the finger for several days. The 11,000
bottles are enough to mark 4 million people. Another shipment was
expected later this week.
   The donation represents part of ``the continued commitment of
the goverment to encourage and contribute to democracy in
Paraguay,'' a statement from the U.S. Embassy said.

   Southwest senators want national drug czar
William J. Bennett to declare the U.S.-Mexico border a
``high-intensity drug trafficking area,'' claiming three grisly,
drug-related mass murders in the past month are a ``brutal reminder
that drug cartels have expanded and moved West.''
   Such a designation would allow the temporary reassignment of
federal personnel to the region and would funnel assistance to
state and local agencies.
   ``Law enforcement officials in Arizona and Texas who have been
involved in the (murder) investigations say the situation is
reminiscent of south Florida in the late '70s and early '80s,''
according to the letter Thursday from the border-state senators.
   The eight senators argue the 2,000-mile border qualifies as a
center of illegal drug production, manufacturing, importation and
distribution, a prerequisite to receiving the emergency drug
designation.
   They point to the fact that Mexico is the primary producer of
marijuana and heroin entering the United States, that California is
one of the largest domestic producers of marijuana, and that
California, New Mexico and Texas are three of the largest U.S.
producers of methamphetamine.
   The Border Patrol has seized more cocaine and marijuana in the
first six months of fiscal 1989 than in all of fiscal 1988, and the
Customs Service reports cocaine seizures are up 425 percent in the
past three years, the senators said.
   In Los Angeles alone, the Drug Enforcement Administration said
15 tons of cocaine were seized in 1988.
   The senators also say Federal Reserve figures show Los Angeles
as the new center for collection of drug profits. The city's
Federal Reserve Bank has a $3.8 billion cash surplus _ a 2,200
percent jump since 1985. During the same time, Miami's Federal
Reserve cash surplus declined by $1.2 billion.
   Although state and local agencies have committed dramatically
increased assets and personnel to drug enforcement, they are being
overwhelmed by drug-related crime, said the senators from
California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.
   The senators also argue drug-related activity on the border is
having a harmful impact on other parts of the country. They point
to crack operations set up in 50 major cities around the country by
two violent Los Angeles gangs, the Crips and the Bloods. Also,
Texas, California and Arizona are three of the top five
distribution centers of illegal drugs in the United States, they
said.
   U.S. attorneys are being overwhelmed by drug cases, while budget
shortfalls, cutbacks or personnel shortages plague various federal
agencies, including Customs, DEA, FBI and Border Patrol, the
senators said.
   Also, they said the area is experiencing an alarming abuse
problem.
   The letter is signed by Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, Pete Wilson, R-Calif., Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., and Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.

   Sikh militants disguised as policemen
killed five people and booby-trapped two of the bodies with
explosives, seriously injuring a villager who tried to identify the
corpses, police said Thursday.
   The police said about 10 extremists, dressed as policemen,
killed two Sikhs and three Hindus Wednesday near the village of
Saeed Kuliyan in Punjab state. The village is 125 miles west of
Chandigarh, the state capital.
   Explosives planted under two of the bodies went off when a
villager, Darshan Singh, turned the corpses over, police said. The
booby trap was apparently meant for policemen, said police
officials in Chandigarh, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Two senior police officials who had accompanied Darshan Singh
were unhurt, police said. The villager was hospitalized with
critical facial injuries, they said.
   Sikh militants are known to kill fellow Sikhs who do not support
their quest for a separate homeland in the rich farming state of
Punjab.
   Meanwhile, news reports said 10 other people were killed
elsewhere in the state since Wednesday.
   Extremists armed with Chinese-made assault rifles shot and
killed five Sikhs in the Amritsar district, Press Trust of India
news agency said.
   It quoted a senior police official, S.P. Singh, as saying that
the killings were a result of rivalry between two groups of
extremists.
   PTI said five more people were killed in other parts of the
state by the extremists.
   The latest deaths raised to 577 the number of people killed in
the state since the beginning of the year by the militants. The
extremists were blamed for more than 2,400 killings in the state
last year.
   Sikhs comprise 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are
in a slight majority in Punjab. Sikh militants launched their
separatist campaign in 1982, alleging discrimination by the
country's Hindu majority, who make up 80 percent of the population.

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly condemned Israel
Thursday for alleged human rights abuses and demanded it halt
excessive gunfire and restrictions on worship in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The vote was 129-2, with one abstention in the 159-member
assembly.
   The United States and Israel voted against the non-binding
resolution, and Liberia abstained. Other nations were absent.
   The assembly resolution, backed by Arab, non-aligned and
socialist nations, also demands that Israel immediately halt its
crackdown and punishment of those participating in the 16-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the territories.
   It was the latest in frequent U.N. condemnations of Israel and
its policies. U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering described the
resolution as ``confrontational,'' and a Israeli diplomat called
the vote hypocritical.
   Pickering said it ``does not improve the situation on the ground
or advance the prospects for peace in the region.''
   He said the United States seeks a comprehensive negotiated
settlement that would provide for an exchange of territory for
peace, the security of all states and the legitimate political
rights of the Palestinian people.
   The U.S. envoy said the status quo in the occupied territories
is ``untenable'' and called the April 13 deaths of four
Palestinians by Israeli gunfire in the West Bank town of Nahalin
``a particularly serious tragedy.''
   Israeli envoy Jeremy Nissim Issacharoff, first secretary at his
mission, denounced the ``immense hypocrisy'' by Arab nations such
as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Syria to condemn Israel.
   He said the Saudi government does not permit religious freedom
and slaughtered Iranian worshippers in Mecca several years ago.
Iraq has killed thousands of its own Kurdish peopls and Syria has
murdered Lebanese, he said, yet both nations lecture Israel about
the evils of occupation and violations of human rights.
   The resolution expresses ``profound shock'' at the Israeli
killings in Nahalin and cited restrictions on attendance at Moslem
mosques during the holy period of Ramadan as a violation of
Palestinian rights to worship.
   The resolution demands that Israel immediately halt its
violations of the convention and respect all Palestinian rights.
   The territories, home to 1.7 million Palestinians, were seized
by Israel from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
   At least 439 Palestinians have been killed since the December
1987 start of the uprising, most by army gunfire, according to a
count by The Associated Press. Eighteen Israelis have also died.

   Disposal of eight old, closed reactors
that produced plutonium fuel for the nation's nuclear weapons could
cost $217 million and take more than 100 years, according to a
draft plan released Thursday.
   The pioneering reactors, some of which date back to the
Manhattan Project during World War II, are on the Hanford federal
nuclear reservation in south-central Washington and have been idled
for years.
   ``No future long-term use of any of the eight surplus production
reactors has been identified by the DOE,'' said the draft
environmental impact statement by the Department of Energy.
   They are the nation's first defense production reactors proposed
for permanent disposal, said Roger Freeberg, chief of Hanford
restoration for the DOE.
   Although the reactors' nuclear fuel has long been removed, they
are still contaminated with 98,100 curies of tritium, 37,400 curies
of carbon-14, 74,400 curies of cobalt-60 and other radioactive
materials that could threaten workers and the environment, the plan
said. A curie is a measure of radioactivity.
   That is why they must be decommissioned or placed in a condition
that ensures public safety and protects the environment, DOE said.
   Five disposal alternatives _ from burying the reactors to
leaving them intact _ were discussed in the report.
   The Energy Department will choose one of the five alternatives
by late 1990, Freeberg said. None of the disposal methods pose any
radiation threat to the public, the report said.
   The eight hulking reactors, built between 1943 and 1955, stand a
few miles apart along the Columbia River. They employed thousands
of workers making highly radioactive plutonium for the nation's
nuclear weapons.
   But from 1964 to 1971 they were shut down one by one as the need
for plutonium, which lasts thousands of years, diminished.
   Only one operable defense reactor, the N Reactor, remains at
Hanford and it is closed because of a plutonium surplus. The
nation's only other defense reactors are at the Savannah River
Plant in South Carolina.
   Among reactors slated for decommissioning is the B Reactor, the
world's first full-size nuclear reactor. It was built during a
crash 15-month period in 1943-1944 as the nation raced to develop
an atomic bomb before Nazi Germany. In fact, the Nazis were far
from developing nuclear weapons.
   The reactor sites should not be abandoned because maintenance is
needed to prevent the release of the remaining radioactivity, the
report said.
   Alternatives studied were:
   _Continue the present routine monitoring and maintenance. Over
100 years, this would cost $41 million in 1986 dollars, with
minimal radiation doses to workers.
   However, at the end of 100 years the reactors and some
radioactive contamination would remain, requiring additional work,
the report said.
   _Immediately move the 9,000 to 11,000-ton reactor vessels to a
Hanford burial site several miles away. This would take about 12
years for all eight reactors, cost about $191 million and be more
hazardous for workers.
   _Wait 75 years for radiation levels to subside before moving the
reactor vessels to the burial site. That would allow radioactive
cobalt 60, a significant threat to workers, to decay and reduce
worker exposure to radiation by an estimated two-thirds.
   This plan would cost $198 million and take 87 years before all
12 reactors would be buried.
   _Wait 75 years and then dismantle each reactor so the waste
could more easily be transported for burial. This plan is most
expensive at $217 million, and would take 103 years for all eight
reactors.
   Worker exposure is over 10 times greater than any other
alternative because workers would be inside the reactor vessel, the
report said.
   _Bury the 46-feet-tall reactor vessels under 16 feet of soil at
their present sites, after the surrounding buildings have been
removed.
   This plan would take five to six years to complete, at a total
cost of $181 million. Except for the proposal to maintain present
conditions, this is the safest alternative for workers.

<HEAD>Missing Girl, 12, Says She Spent Month in Dark, Unheated Storeroom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old girl missing for more than a
month told her parents and authorities she had been living in a
dark, unheated storeroom at the urging of her 16-year-old boyfriend.
   Amanda Wells was listed in good condition Thursday at St.
Joseph's Hospital, where she was taken Wednesday suffering from
malnutrition and dehydration. The girl told police she ate only a
peanut butter sandwich every other day while living in the
storeroom of her boyfriend's apartment building.
   Kenneth Wells said his daughter, who ran away from home March
17, dropped from 125 pounds to about 106 pounds during the 33-day
ordeal. Her body temperature was 95 degrees when she turned herself
in early Wednesday. Normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees.
   Authorities charged the girl's boyfriend, Jerry E. Leonard Jr.,
with first-degree custodial interference, a felony, and endangering
the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor. City Judge Jeffrey R.
Merrill entered an innocent plea on Leonard's behalf and released
him to Onondaga County's pretrial release program.
   Amanda ran away from home after her parents said they wanted her
to stop dating Leonard because of his age. The two began dating
when they were 15 and 11, the girl said in an affidavit to police.
   ``I would go and see him behind their backs. We were in love
with each other, and we both wanted to keep dating,'' she told
police.
   The girl said every other day she would eat a peanut butter
sandwich her boyfriend brought her. She showered twice during the
period, when Leonard's father was not home. She slept between two
upright mattresses and went to the bathroom in a jar.
   The girl said her boyfriend told her that if police found her
she would end up in a detention center until she was 18 and he
would be in jail for the rest of his life.
   ``I was scared of what he told me, so I made sure I didn't get
caught,'' she said in the affidavit. ``After a month of sleeping in
the storeroom and being hungry because I had little food, I finally
left and went home.
   ``I figured whatever the police did to me, it couldn't be any
worse than what Jerry is doing to me,'' she said.

<HEAD>Three Deaths Reported In Clashes Between Opposition, Authorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Demonstrators protesting what
they call the fraudulent re-election of President Didier Ratsiraka
fought with police in clashes that left three people dead and about
60 injured, news reports said.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse said the violence
broke out Wednesday afternoon after a rally called by an opposition
coalition.
   It said several hundred demonstrators, mostly young, burned
vehicles and looted stores in the center of Antananarivo, the
capital of the Indian Ocean island nation. The agency quoted
informed sources as saying young children were among the injured.
It said authorities gave no indication how many people were
arrested.
   The report cited what it called a provisional official count of
the casualties. The count could not immediately be confirmed.
   In a previous round of clashes following an opposition rally
Sunday, the government-controlled radio said 13 people were hurt,
including three policemen, and 20 people were arrested.
   Ratsiraka, chosen by the military to rule in 1975, was
re-elected to a third seven-year term on March 12 with about 62
percent of the vote. The three opposition parties challenged the
outcome in the island nation's Supreme Court, saying the voting was
rigged.
   The opposition leaders are proposing formation of a provisional
government, including representatives of the military, students and
churches, to rule while new elections are prepared.
   Ceremonies marking the beginning of Ratsiraka's third term were
scheduled later Thursday.

<TEXT>
   An eminent Yale physicist who received
the nation's top science medal last year was named President Bush's
chief science adviser on Thursday.
   D. Allan Bromley, who received the National Medal of Science
from President Reagan last year, will take a leave of absence from
the Ivy League university to advise Bush on defense, the
environment and other science-related issues.
   In an interview Thursday, before the announcement was made in
Washington, D.C., Bromley said he wasn't intimidated by the
prospect of working with high-powered politicians.
   ``Anyone who survives 30 years on an Ivy League faculty is
reasonably conditioned to politics in its purist sense,'' said
Bromley, 62.
   Bromley declined to say which science issues he considers most
important, but he has supported the president's call to continue
research for the Strategic Defense Initiative or ``star wars.''
   He also has expressed concern for science education, saying
something must be done to attract bright young minds to science.
   He will serve as assistant to the president for science and
technology, and also is nominated to be director of the Office of
Science and Technology Policy, which requires Senate confirmation.
   Bush announced in October that he planned to make the post of
assistant for science and technology a notch below cabinet level.
As such, Bromley will attend Cabinet and National Security Council
meetings, as well as coordinate federal research policy. The
position pays $89,500 a year.
   Bromley said he is well aware that he might on occasion have to
put aside his own scientific opinions to carry out the president's
policies.
   Bromley has held many governmental advisory positions, including
serving as a member of the White House Science Council under
Reagan. In addition, he's been past chairman and president for both
the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the
International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.
   He will take a leave from Yale, where he has worked since 1960.
   His wife of nearly 40 years, Patricia, will give up her job as
chief archivist for the New Haven Colony Historical Society.
Previously, she had been the assistant dean of Yale's graduate
school. They have two grown children.
   At Yale, he is both a teacher and a researcher. He is the Henry
Ford II professor of physics and was chairman of the physics
department for seven years. He founded the university's Arthur M.
Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory in 1963 and has been its
director ever since.
   ``We have graduated more doctorates in experimental nuclear
physics than any other institution in the world,'' the native of
Canada said.
   Some semesters he teaches nuclear physics to graduate students,
while in the recent semester he taught science and public policy to
undergraduates. He also works with about 25 graduate students and
15 undergraduate students at the Wright laboratory.

   A helicopter pilot accused of trying to fly a
convicted drug trafficker out of a federal prison once worked with
a man accused of being a member of the smuggler's marijuana ring,
authorities said.
   And a plane owned by the pilot, Charles Clayton Stevens, and
adapted with extra fuel tanks for a range of about 1,000 miles, is
in storage at the Crystal River Airport on Florida's Gulf Coast,
said airport operations manager Tom Davis
   Stevens, 34, remained hospitalized Thursday recovering from two
broken legs he suffered Monday when his helicopter crashed after
its tail rotor caught a fence at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center.
   Stevens faces federal charges of aiding in the escape attempt of
convicted trafficker Benjamin ``Barry'' Kramer, who also broke a
leg in the crash and is hospitalized.
   Federal authorities initially did not know what connection
Stevens, who was a sea-urchin diver in Gold Beach, Ore., had with
Kramer, a former championship power-boat driver based in Miami.
   But David Showalter, president of the Oregon company where
Stevens worked, said that in 1987 and 1988 Stevens pilot worked for
six months with John James Marren, accused by federal authorities
in Illinois of being a link in Kramer's drug distribution operation.
   ``Kramer had the Colombian connections,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Michael Carr of Benton, Ill. ``Marren was one of the
middlemen in the distribution ring ... they definitiely knew each
other.''
   Marren also was a former operator of the Nature's Oven
restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, which Carr called ``a meeting place
for members of the drug ring.''
   Marren, 45, faces charges of conspiracy to distribute marijuana,
but has pleaded innocent and is awaiting trial, said his attorney,
Christopher Heid.

   Teams of Navy chaplains and officers went
from father and mother to wife to sister or brother Thursday, 47
times over, to break the news about who was killed aboard the USS
Iowa.
   ``It's the hardest thing we do,'' said Cmdr. Doug Palmer, acting
base chaplain for the sprawling Norfolk Naval Base that is home
port for the stricken battleship.
   ``I've done it many times and I'll never get used to it,'' said
Palmer, who supervised 52 chaplains called into duty Wednesday
after a powerful explosion ripped through a gun turret on the Iowa
during training exercises near Puerto Rico.
   Navy policy is for each family that loses someone on sea duty to
be visited by a chaplain and a Navy officer who offer assistance
and counseling.
   Jack E. Thompson Sr. was told about the death of his 22-year-old
son, Jack Jr., by Navy representatives in Greeneville, Tenn., where
the young man had been a star football tackle in high school.
   ``He came to me after he graduated from high school and said,
`Daddy, I'd only go to college to play ball,' '' Thompson recalled.
``I told him if that's the only reason, he should go to the Navy.
That makes me feel a little bad.''
   ``He enjoyed the travel. He'd been everywhere _ Italy, France,
Norway, Germany, England, the Persian Gulf,'' said his wife, Leasa.
But she said her husband was an outdoorsman who looked forward to
getting out of the Navy and building a log cabin in Tennessee.
   Dellar Romine said the grim news of her son, Harold Earl Romine
Jr., 19, came with a knock on the door of her Bradenton, Fla., home
early Thursday morning.
   ``About the time I woke up, this knock came at the door,'' she
said. ``I just knew that was it.''
   The parents of Ernest Hanyecz, 27, of Bordentown, N.J., said
they stayed up all night trying fruitlessly to get information from
the Navy about their son's death before an official called them
Thursday morning.
   ``As long as they play their war games, there will be more
deaths and innocent people will die,'' said Ernest Hanyecz Sr., who
said his son joined the Navy 10 years ago at age 17.
   Relatives of another victim, Stephen J. Welden, 23, of Oklahoma
City, said his posting to a battleship had been almost a lifelong
dream.
   ``He had served four years in the Navy and had signed up for
another four years on condition he serve on the Iowa,'' said
Welden's younger brother, Bill, 22.
   ``He was very happy,'' said Welden's mother, Mary. ``He loved
what he was doing. He was where he wanted to be.''
   Scott A. Holt, 20, of Terre Haute, Ind., had telephoned his
grandparents, Keith and June Woodsmall of Riley, last week, just
before the Iowa set sail for the training exercise.
   ``He said they were going to leave port tomorrow morning and go
down to Puerto Rico and shoot the big guns,'' said Mrs. Woodsmall.
   About 250 relatives of Iowa crewmen spent the night in a
gymnasium on the base, but most left after the fatality
notifications were completed about 3 a.m., said Lt. Cmdr. Mike
Todd, a base spokesman.
   Rear Adm. Jimmy Pappas, the base commander, said those who found
out a family crewman survived were ``overjoyed with tears.''
   Family members of the dead were called aside individually and
told, he said.
   ``It's the greatest tragedy any of us can suffer,'' Pappas said.
``It's the most difficult thing you have to do'' to tell someone
that a loved one has been killed.
   Palmer said he knew of no complaints by families over the time
it takes to notify relatives. But occasional outbursts are natural
in such stressful situations, he said.
   ``The people come in and they don't know, `Am I the unlucky
one?''' he said.
   A memorial service for the victims will be conducted Monday on
the base. Pappas said the dead included one officer and 46 enlisted
personnel and that most of the victims were single and from 18 to
22 years old.
   Hundreds of people called the base's family services office to
volunteer food, money, child care, Palmer said.
   Pappas said even the Internal Revenue Service called to help
with expedited tax refunds or waivers of scheduled audits.
   He said the tragedy would have an emotional impact on the base,
but other sailors ``know they've got to go on and do their jobs.''
   Liz Hengerer, whose husband serves aboard a submarine and who
takes part in the family support program, said Navy families stick
together in times of crisis.
   ``You know that your husbands go to sea. ... I don't know how I
would react,'' said Mrs. Hengerer.

   U.N. relief officials Thursday demanded that
Israel stop using gunfire to quell Palestinian protests, and Moslem
clerics urged Palestinians to defy Israeli restrictions on worship
at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque.
   In the Gaza Strip, at least 16 Palestinians were reported
wounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops.
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which aids Palestinian
refugees, said 13 Palestinians, six of them younger than 15, were
shot to death by Israeli troops in the past week.
   ``We deplore this loss of life and call for a halt to the use of
lethal firepower against civilians, young and old,'' the agency
said in a statement issued in Vienna and distributed in Jerusalem.
   An army spokeswoman defended the troops, saying ``they do
everything in their power to avoid deaths.'' She said every
Palestinian death is being investigated by a senior officer.
   The U.N. agency criticism came the same day the U.N. General
Assembly voted 129-2 to condemn Israel for alleged human rights
abuses and demand it halt excessive gunfire and restrictions on
worship. The United States and Israel voted against the non-binding
resolution, and Liberia abstained.
   Under army policy, troops may fire live ammunition only when
their lives are in danger. Plastic bullets, which can be fatal when
fired from a range of less than 70 yards, may be used to break up
violent protests or stop fleeing inciters.
   At least 439 Palestinians have been killed since the December
1987 start of the uprising, most by army gunfire, according to a
count by The Associated Press. Eighteen Israelis have also died.
   The U.N. agency on Thursday put the Palestinian death toll at
442, and said nearly 25,000 have been wounded by army gunfire.
   It also protested the prolonged closure of the West Bank's 1,200
schools, including 90 run by the U.N. agency.
   The military government has kept schools closed for most of the
uprising, saying they are flashpoints of anti-Israeli violence. The
latest military order extended school closures until May 19.
   ``If they (schools) cannot reopen before the end of next month
and are not allowed to remain open through the summer months, a
whole school year will be lost,'' the U.N. agency said.
   A military government official said no date has been set for
reopening schools, calling the situation too tense for such a move.
Palestinians have alleged the school closures are a form of
punishment.
   In Jerusalem, Al Aqsa preacher Sheikh Mohammed Al Jamal called
on Moslems in the occupied territories to attend Friday noon
prayers at the mosque to challenge the Israeli restrictions.
   The police order was enacted after Palestinians stoned police in
the mosque compound following prayers on April 7, the first Friday
of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan.
   On April 14, police turned away most West Bank and Gaza Strip
Palestinians trying to reach the mosque compound, known as Haram Al
Sharif, the third holiest site of Islam after Mecca and Medina in
Saudi Arabia.
   ``We call on Moslems to perform Friday prayers at Al Aqsa
Mosque,'' Al Jamal told reporters.
   ``If the Israeli authorities prevent Moslems from entering the
mosque, they are to pray in the Old City of Jerusalem. If they are
barred from entering the city, they are to pray on the roads
leading to Jerusalem,'' he said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army shot and wounded 12
Palestinians during stone-throwing clashes in the Khan Yunis
refugee camp, an army official said. Arab doctors only confirmed
three casualties in the camp.
   The reason for the discrepancy was not clear. Usually, Arab
casualty reports exceed the figures confirmed by the army.
   Arab hospital officials said four other Palestinians were
wounded in clashes in the village of Beit Hanoun, the town of
Rafah, and the Nuseirat and Shati refugee camps. The army said it
was checking the report.

   Senators plan to start hearing evidence
against U.S. District Court Judge Alcee L. Hastings on July 10, a
special committee formed for his impeachment trial said Thursday.
   The panel made the decision in a closed-doors meeting Wednesday.
   In the meeting, the committee headed by Sen. Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M., also set Aug. 4 as a target date for wrapping up the
presentation of evidence, according to spokesman Tony Harvey.
   Harvey said the committee decided to defer any decision on a
request from Hastings attorney Terence Anderson of Miami for
$200,000 in expenses from the government and an unspecified amount
in fees to conduct the defense of the 52-year-old judge.
   Hastings, of Miami, was named in 17 articles of impeachment
approved by the House 413-3 on Aug. 3. The document accuses him of
plotting to obtain a payoff and improperly disclosing secret
wiretap information.
   The Senate must now decide whether to convict Hastings and thus
remove him from office and stop his $89,500 annual salary.
   The committee's proceedings will be carried on Senate television
and also videotaped for viewing later by lawmakers who are not on
the 12-member panel.
   The committee will not issue any recommendation on whether to
convict Hastings but merely a report on the evidence against him.
The final decision on whether to remove him from the bench will be
made by the whole Senate.
   The impeachment trial before the Senate is not the same thing as
a criminal trial and the worst that can befall Hastings if
convicted is removal from office.
   A federal court jury acquitted him of the bribe conspiracy at a
1983 trial. But his alleged coconspirator, Washington attorney
William Borders, was convicted at a separate trial and sent to
prison.
   Harvey described the committee's target date of Aug. 4 as ``a
very firm goal and objective'' but acknowledged that the panel was
not absolutely bound to stick by it under any circumstances.
   A witness list submitted to the committee indicated the Hastings
camp plans to call more than 108 persons, including former Attorney
General Griffin Bell as well as an assortment of FBI agents,
alleged organized crime figures, political operatives and others.

   Witnesses said a child was killed and
at least 25 people were injured Thursday, when police and municipal
workers bulldozed a shantytown in an upper-class neighborhood of
the capital.
   Susan Davis, a program officer with the Ford Foundation, said
she saw the body of a young girl and saw several injured men after
the demolition in the Gulshan district.
   ``I was told by the residents of the shantytown that police took
away two bodies and at least one person died in hospital,'' she
said.
   Chappal Bashar, a correspondent for a Bengali-language
newspaper, said he also saw the child's body. There was no
confirmation of the other deaths.
   Most diplomatic missions and foreigners' homes are in Gulshan.
Police said the demolition was to clear land for a park.
   Doctors at a Dhaka hospital, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said at least 10 people were treated for injuries. Ms. Davis said
at least 15 injured people did not go to the hospital.
   Police said about 2,000 people were evicted but denied using
force or causing casualties. Muncipal officials were not available
for comment.
   Ms. Davis said she was shown empty tear gas canisters, which
residents said were fired by police before demolition began.
   ``I saw the poor people gathering their belongings after the
evictions,'' she said. ``It was terrible. I was shocked to see the
rampage.''

<TEXT>
   A man who bought a 300-year-old map of Paris
in a junk shop for $3 may see his investment return as much as $10
million.
   A prospective buyer from Denver sent word Thursday that he would
pay Edward Jones of Indianapolis whatever price is set by
Christie's, the New York auction house, and Frederick L. Bein,
geography department head at Indiana University-Purdue University
here.
   The buyer originally offered $10 million for the map, one of
several copies believed commissioned by King Louis XIV in 1671.
   Bein said he would be willing to explain its historical
significance to Christie's, but couldn't place a value on the
nine-piece, 4-by-5-foot map.
   ``What it's worth is whatever a buyer is willing to pay for
it,'' said Bein, who has researched the map. ``I have no idea what
it's worth. I'm not an art dealer; I'm a professor.''
   Cartographer Franquois de la Pointe took seven years to complete
the map, assisted by such notables as Isaac Newton, astronomer
Edmund Halley (for whom the comet is named) and Christian Huygens,
inventor of the pendulum clock, Bein said.
   It accurately depicts Paris and its environs as they were in
1671 and includes the plan for the Palace of Versailles, built by
Louis XIV.
   In 1986, Christie's examined the map and concluded it was 300
years old. At the time, the auction house refused to place a value
on it, but Lloyd's of London insured it for $10 million.
   Jones stumbled upon the map while rummaging through an
Indianapolis Salvation Army store in 1985. Its brilliant water
colors were carefully added after it was printed. It may be the
only colored version of the map in existence, Jones said.
   The British Museum has a copy, although it is in black and
white. Others are catalogued in the National Archives in France.
   After keeping it for four years in a bank vault, Jones is eager
to sell it. He placed an advertisement four weeks ago and has had
offers of $7 million, $8 million and $8.5 million from various
buyers, he said.
   The offer from the Denver buyer, who prefers to remain
anonymous, was the largest.
   The French government has also expressed interest, Jones said.
   Bein's research shows the map was the first to employ meridian
lines of longitude, using a technique developed by Galileo about
1600. The technique made the map more accurate and scientific than
any drawn before.
   It was the first accurate map of Paris and the beginning of a
100-year project to map all of France, Bein said.
   The map also introduced the use of hachuring, a method of
showing elevation that cartographers employed for hundreds of years.
   ``There were a number of copies. It was made on copper plates,''
Bein said. ``How many were run off? Who knows?''
   Jones, 44, admitted being nervous at possibly attaining
millionaire status after living on a $20,000 income. He has no
plans for the money other than paying off investors.
   ``I guess I'll do some things with God. Whatever he lays on my
heart,'' he said.

<HEAD>French Police and Pro-Independence Protesters Clash in Guadeloupe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) _ Police clashed with several
hundred demonstrators Thursday in the north coast town of Port
Louis over the arrests of seven pro-independence activists in this
French Caribbean island.
   The demonstrators set up huge roadblocks across the main roads
leading to and from the town. Although the violent clashes had
ceased by noon, banks, schools, stores and all government offices
remained closed.
   The political unrest began following the arrests Tuesday of
seven pro-independence activists or supporters of the tiny Popular
Union for the Liberation of Guadeloupe.
   The seven are charged with bomb attacks in January 1988 on a
bank and the homes of five French European residents, including a
lawyer, a doctor and an army officer.
   Among those arrested was Jean Barfleur, a prominent member of
the Popular Union and a member of the town's city council.
   The group said in a statement broadcast by radio stations
Wednesday that the arrests are a ``new maneuver by the French
government to repress the freedom of the independence movement.''
   Police did not say how long the seven would be detained or
exactly what they were charged with.
   A police statement said the arrests were ``closely connected''
to the creation of a new ``revolutionary organization'' based in
Port Louis, one of the few towns in this island of 340,000 where a
large number of people support independence from France.
   Police gave no details on the alleged organization.
   One of the alleged bombers is still at large, but local news
reports say he can be identified because he lost two fingers in the
explosion in front of one of the bombing targets. The fingers
allegedly were recovered by the police.
   A number of unions and organizations, including the Guadeloupean
Communist Party, have denounced the arrests.

   The Savannah Police Department's horse
patrol helps sweep crime from the streets, but the
tourism-conscious city realizes the animals leave something behind
that itself must be swept up.
   So police have developed a plan of action for when one of their
steeds heeds nature's call.
   ``We're not going to let the city become unsightly,'' said Lt.
Mickey Browne, commander of the traffic unit, which includes the
horse patrol.
   At the first sign of trouble, Browne said, the mounted officer
is to radio his location to a police traffic unit. The traffic
officer then picks up a community-service worker, one of the
misdemeanor offenders assigned to pick up litter downtown, and
takes him to the scene.
   To make the process even more efficient, Browne said, police are
trying to time the horses' digestive cycles to determine when
cleanup is more likely to be needed.

<HEAD>Ljubojevic, Kasparov Tie First, Kasparov Defeats Spassky in Final
Game</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World chess champion Garri Kasparov and
Yugoslav Grandmaster Ljubomir Ljubojevic tied for first place in
the fourth Chess World Cup tournament Thursday when Kasparov
defeated former world champion Boris Spassky in the final round.
   Kasparov, 26, and Ljubojevic, 38, each finished with 11 points
out of a possible 16. Soviet Grandmaster Valery Salov came in third
with 10 points, and Viktor Korchnoi, a Soviet defector who now
plays for Switzerland, came in fourth 9{ points.
   The world cup, a series of six tournaments staged over two years
and featuring a total prize fund of $1.2 million, is widely
regarded as the second most important chess event after the world
championship.
   Ljubojevic, who went into the final round a half point ahead of
Kasparov, agreed to a rapid 10-move draw with British Grandmaster
Nigel Short.
   This enabled Kasparov to tie for first with a win over Spassky.
   For 7{ years, Kasparov has won or tied for first place in every
chess event in which he has participated. If Ljubojevic had won his
final game, Kasparov's run would have been broken.
   ``I'm very pleased with my game today, but I think Nigel was a
little impolite because he didn't play,'' Kasparov said moments
after his victory.
   Kasparov had expected Short, who had the advantage of the white
pieces, to play for a win against Ljubojevic.
   With his victory, Kasparov remains within striking distance of
Bobby Fischer's record as the highest-ranked player in history.
   Tournament organizers said the winners each would earn $17,500.
   They said Kasparov, who has better tiebreakers, would receive
the trophy for first place in the tournament, but Ljubojevic will
finish a half-point ahead of Kasparov in the world cup calculations.
   This is because one of the competitors, Spanish Grandmaster
Miguel Illescas, is playing as a representative of the host nation
and is not one of the 25 top grandmasters eligible for the world
cup.
   Results against Illescas are removed from the standings before
the world cup calculations are made. Kasparov, who defeated
Illescas in the 16th round, will have a point removed from his
score in the world cup standings, while Ljubojevic, who drew with
Illescas in the eight round, will only drop half a point.
   Kasparov won the second and third tournaments, held last year in
Belfort, France and Reykjavik, Iceland, and currently is leading
the series. Former world champion Anatoly Karpov, who won the first
event in Brussels, is close behind in second place.
   It is not clear if this result will affect Kasparov's final
world cup placing. Each grandmaster plays in four of the six
competitions, but only their best three results will be counted.
   The fifth tournament in the series will be staged in the Dutch
port city of Rotterdam in June. The final event, featuring a
Kasparov-Karpov clash is scheduled for August, in Skelleftea,
northern Sweden.
   Many of Thursday's other games were agreed drawn quickly by
grandmasters exhausted by three weeks of top-flight competition.
   Korchnoi, playing with the advntage of the white pieces, agreed
to a draw with Salov after only 10 moves, while the game between
British Grandmaster Jonathan Speelman and Johann Hjartarson of
Iceland was drawn in 15 moves.
   Short and Robert Huebner of West Germany finished in a tie for
fifth place with nine points. Huebner and Alexander Belyavsky of
the Soviet Union battled for six hours before finally agreeing to a
draw.
   Predrag Nikolic of Yugoslavia drew his game with Soviet
Grandmaster Artur Yusupov and finished eighth among the seventeen
competitors with eight points out of 16.

<HEAD>Warning To Street Gangs Issued Under New Street Terrorism Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police handed citations to thousands of gang
members Thursday, branding them members of criminal organizations
in the first step of enforcing a new law aimed against street
terrorism.
   ``Up until this law, it was not a crime to belong to the Crips,
it was not a crime to belong to the Bloods, or any of these other
criminal Hispanic street gangs,'' District Attorney Ira Reiner said
at a news conference.
   What's illegal, Reiner said, is doing anything to help pursue
the gang's criminal objectives.
   ``If you belong to one of these gangs, and you know what they're
about, and that's easy enough to prove, and you do any act in
furtherance of their criminal activity, then you have committed a
felony by virtue of your membership in that gang,'' Reiner said.
   For example, the law allows the prosecution of a cited gang
member who only lends a car that is used in a drive-by shooting,
because he has been formally told the gang is a criminal street
gang.
   Gang violence claimed more than 350 lives across the nation's
most populous county last year. Many victims are innocent
bystanders caught in the crossfire.
   ``You are hereby notified that the Venice Shoreline Crips Gang
is a criminal street gang,'' read a sample citation shown to
reporters. Those served with the notice printed in English and
Spanish are asked to sign a receipt.
   Officials said the notices should be easy to serve because of
gang members' high visibility on their home turf, law officers'
familiarity with them, and the gang ethic which forbids them from
denying membership in their ``set.''
   Reiner was joined at the news conference by City Attorney James
Hahn, whose office also will be able to enforce the law as
misdemeanor offense.
   His office previously filed a civil lawsuit against the Playboy
Gangster Crips, claiming they were a nuisance. But that action only
brought short jail stays through contempt of court actions until
legal challenges defeated it.
   Reiner acknowledged that the California Street Terrorism
Enforcement and Prevention Act will be subject to legal challenges
and won't cure the region's gang problem.
   The new law took effect Jan. 1, but the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's office and police from Los Angeles, Compton, Long Beach,
Pomona and Pasadena reviewed the targeted gangs to make sure they
met the law's criteria.
   The departments had prepared 3,700 notices for Thursday. Those
being served include ``a mixture of various offshoots of the
Bloods, Crips, and Hispanic street gangs, the dirtiest gangs in the
area,'' said district attorney office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons.
   Under the law, the gang has to consist of three or more members
and engaged in at least two or more crimes enumerated in the law:
assault with a deadly weapon, robbery, homicide or manslaughter,
sale or possession of narcotics and controlled substances, shooting
in an inhabited dwelling or vehicle, arson, or witness intimidation.
   Reiner said the law was written to avoid the pitfall of previous
efforts to link relationships with undesirable characters as
criminal activities, known as status offender laws, which were
struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Prosecutors will have to show that defendants were active gang
members, that they knew of the gang's criminal activity and engaged
in an act that furthered that activity _ all of which keep the law
a constitutional distance from guilt by association, Reiner claimed.

   A landslide crashed down into a river in the
southern Georgia republic and sent the river surging over its
banks, flooding a small village and leaving dozens of people
missing and feared dead, Tass said Thursday.
   The Soviet news agency said the disaster in the mountain village
of Tsablana occurred as mudslides, avalanches and floods destroyed
or heavily damaged more than 500 houses elsewhere in Georgia this
week.
   The evening television news program Vremya reported five people
were killed Wednesday and said about 13,000 people in the southern
republic are threatened by the floods, melting snow and mudslides.
It said 800 families have been evacuated.
   The account by Tass correspondent Yuri Goldman was from Tbilisi,
the capital of Georgia. Tsablana lies in the mountains of the
Adjarian autonomous republic in the republic of Georgia.
   Tass reported that an enormous wall of earth crashed down on the
Charukh River and formed a natural dam about 325 feet high and
2,000 feet across, causing a deluge which submerged four houses
with about 30 people inside.
   Only five people were pulled out alive from the water and one
died a short time later, it said. In addition, two bodies were
recovered.
   A local bus believed to be carrying more than 20 passengers also
was swept away, and a search for survivors has produced no results,
the agency reported.
   The television gave a slightly different account. It said 52
people were caught in a landslide on Mount Salgan Wednesday which
buried four houses and a bus. It said five bodies have been
recovered and rescuers are searching for the missing 47.
   Sunday was proclaimed a day of mourning in Georgia.

<HEAD>Brown University Gunfight Play Too Real For Restaurant Patrons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trembling man entered a restaurant,
sat across from another man and began arguing. He pulled a pistol
and talked about his brother's hospitalization, drugs, money and
the police.
   The argument _ which nearly ended in a shootout _ was just a
play. But a patron at Louie's restaurant was not amused.
   The first performance of ``Jokereye,'' a play by Brown
University junior Craig Picone, almost started a real fight
Saturday when a Louie's patron who also is a Brown student _
realized the confrontation was a hoax and angrily confronted the
actors and director.
   Dave Ronick, miffed by the performance, said although the
theater group posted notices in Louie's windows, they failed to
indicate the time and ``certainly didn't say anything about the use
of guns in Louie's.''
   ``I directed it with realism in mind,'' said Jason Neulander, a
Brown sophomore.
   He said he decided to move it off the traditional stage after a
customer listened to the actors reading the play in Louie's and
said it sounded real.
   The play involves two armed men, Phil and Jimmy, arguing about a
drug exchange, and the waitress who serves them in a restaurant.
The actors borrowed real guns from the Brown theater department _ a
.22-caliber handgun and a .357-caliber Magnum.
   ``I wanted to see, with an unknowing audience, what happened and
how they would react,'' Neulander said.
   Ronick and a friend had briefly contemplated grabbing for the
guns and other options before a waitress told them what was going
on. Ronick said a lot of people were stunned and the use of guns in
public infuriated him.
   An English major, Ronick followed the two actors out of Louie's
and told them what he thought of their performance. He later
grabbed the director by the shirt collar.
   ``If you were in New York, you would have gotten shot,'' Ronick,
a New Yorker, told them.
   The actors were ``totally freaked out,'' said Neulander, who was
inside Louie's paying the bill when the confrontation occurred.
   The actors had anticipated anger, Neulander said. They wanted
the audience to become part of the play, to break the wall between
players and spectators, he said.
   But, he said, the actors weren't ready for a response directed
at them personally.
   ``It was poor judgment on their part,'' said Providence police
Commander Richard S. Tamburini.``It could have led to a tragedy.''

   Attackers thought to be Sinhalese
militants beheaded four members of a Sinhalese family and stabbed a
fifth to death because one was a suspected police informer,
military officials said Thursday.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the bodies were found Thursday at Kottegoda village, about 65
miles east of Colombo, with a note beside them saying one was an
informer.
   Police said four other bodies were found in neighboring
Kamburupittiya village. The bodies, as yet unidentified, had
gunshot wounds, police said.
   It was not known if the incidents were connected.
   The violence came as state-run television repeated President
Ranasinghe Premadasa's longstanding amnesty offer to militants on
both sides who surrender.
   Sinhalese extremists began their anti-government campaign in
July 1987 to protest a government peace plan with the Tamils, who
are fighting for an independent state on the island's north and
east.
   The Sinhalese complain too much is conceded to the Tamils, who
form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. Tamils claim they
are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent
of the population.
   India sponsored the plan and later sent in troops to enforce an
arms surrender by the Tamil insurgents because of the sympathies of
its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause.
   The more radical Tamil groups continued their separatist fight,
begun in 1983.
   At least 12,600 people have died in the separatist campaign and
the Sinhalese backlash.

   An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter
scale shook the Stanovoy Mountains in eastern Soviet Union on
Thursday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
   There were no reports of damage or casualties from the
earthquake, recorded at 5 p.m. (MDT). It was the strongest reported
in the the southeastern Siberian mountains since a quake measuring
6.6 was recorded Jan. 18, 1967.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Each increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   The State Department has admitted to female
Foreign Service officers that it discriminated against women and
they may be eligible for court-ordered relief, The Washington Post
reported.
   The admission was part of a notice sent to diplomatic posts
worldwide and posted at State Department headquarters as the latest
step in a long legal process, the newspaper reported in its
Thursday editions.
   In addition, the State Department has canceled the 1989 Foreign
Service examination, department officials said Wednesday night.
   The admission to female officials arose from a suit filed in
1976 by Alison Palmer, a now-retired Foreign Serivce officer who
claimed the department discriminated against women in hiring and
promotion.
   The State Department had won in a lower court but was reversed
three months ago by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia. The State Department is planning to appeal that decision,
the Post said.
   In the meantime, the State Department has been proceeding with a
detailed plan to notify female employees of discrimination between
1976 and 1985, the newspaper reported.
   Men got better career assignments and were generally given more
high-profile opportunities to advance their careers, according to
the notices cited by the Post.

   Television pioneer Milton Berle's wife, Ruth,
who was active in Democratic politics and philanthropic causes, had
died at age 67.
   Mrs. Berle, who suffered from cancer, died Tuesday night at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said her husband's publicist, Tim
Scerba.
   Her husband, known affectionately as ``Mr. Television,''
credited her with being the stabilizing influence in his life.
   ``Ruth has settled me down,'' the actor-comedian once said. ``I
call her Rocky _ my rock of Gibraltar.''
   The couple met in 1951 and were married two years later. They
adopted a son, Bill.
   Berle, 80, starred in such landmark television shows as ``Texaco
Star Theater,'' and ``The Milton Berle Show,'' and has appeared in
a number of films.
   Mrs. Berle was involved in many philanthropic causes in Los
Angeles, including S.H.A.R.E., an organization dedicated to aiding
mentally handicapped children.
   She was active in the Democratic Party and was a California
delegate to the 1968 Democratic National Convention that nominated
Hubert Humphrey for president.
   She was born in Portland, Maine, and was reared in Paterson, N.J.
   A veteran of World War II, she served in the Women's Army Corps,
rising to the rank of captain and company commander by the war's
end.
   She began working in public relations in New York in the 1940s,
doing work for such motion picture studios as Samuel Goldwyn
Productions, United Artists, and RKO.
   Besides her husband and son, she is survived by her mother,
brother, sister-in-law, stepdaughter Vicki Walton and two
stepgrandsons.
   The family planned a private burial.

after bowing to a last-minute plea to strengthen a key reform.
   Dwarfing all other government bailouts, the plan approved
Wednesday would provide at least $157 billion over the next decade
_ most of it from taxpayers _ to close or merge 350 failed thrift
institutions and make good on government pledges in the rescue of
200 others last year.
   It would also reorganize the regulatory bureaucracy, provide $50
million a year for the Justice Department to pursue fraud in S&amp;Ls

owners back their lending with more of their own capital.

   President Bush is facing increasing
congressional criticism over his handling of the Alaska oil spill
and a public opinion poll shows a sharp drop in the president's
rating on environmental issues.
   A hearing before the Senate environmental protection
subcommittee Wednesday was marked by repeated questioning of
administration witnesses on why the federal government did not move
more quickly to control the spill and limit its spread along
Alaska's southern coast.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine suggested Bush
was ``far too slow to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster''
and said federal laws should be changed to require that the federal
government assume control of such a spill immediately unless it is
clear the cleanup is going properly in private hands.
   Because of the ``unbelievably slow'' response by not only
industry, but also the Bush administration ``there has never been a
time when this situation was under control,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., chairman of the environmental subcommittee.
   Meanwhile, a coalition of environmental groups today released a
poll indicating that the spill has affected how Bush is perceived
in dealing with environmental issues.
   The telephone survey conducted by Lou Harris &amp; Associates shows
a 21 percent drop in the number of people who believe Bush is doing
a good job in handling environmental matters, according to Debra
Callahan, executive director of Americans for the Environment. The
poll was based on telephone interviews with 1,250 people nationwide
between March 26 and March 30, Ms. Callahan said. The margin of
error was not immediately available.

   The campaign for the hearts, minds and votes

activists writing 200,000 letters to the attorney general while
anti-abortion activists plan a series of newspaper ads.
   The American Civil Liberties Union said Wednesday it plans to

asking the department to drop its attempt to have the landmark 1973
decision legalizing abortion overturned.
   On the other side of the issue, the National Right to Life

and to run the ad in other papers around the country after that,
said spokesman Dan Donehey.
   The Justice Department filed a brief with the Supreme Court

   Although the conditions are better than in many other Swiss

   Khashoggi, once reputed to be among the world's richest men,

<TEXT>
   The austerity program China began seven months
ago has undone many much-vaunted economic reforms and is
threatening the profit incentives that gave them success.
   Some economists worry that the Chinese government's clampdown on
construction, loans and government spending will do more harm than
good to an economy afflicted by 36 percent inflation and critical
shortages of electricity and most raw materials.
   The economic reforms, set in motion 10 years ago, set a course
now being followed by other communist countries, including the
Soviet Union, to loosen state controls and permit some sectors to
operate for profit.
   But the Chinese have applied the brakes.
   The economists say the government's austerity threatens to shut
down the private and rural enterprises that have proved so
successful, leave millions of rural residents jobless, and produce
the same combination of inflation and depression that plagued the
West in the 1970s.
   ``We can already smell the coming stagflation,'' said a recent
commentary in the Guangzhou (Canton) newspaper Asian-Pacific
Economic Times, noting that many factories were paralyzed by the
cash freeze brought on by austerity. To get production going again,
it said, the government will be forced to print more money, fueling
inflation.
   Labor expert Yang Tiren at the People's University in Beijing
said the economy already has entered a recession, evidenced by the
millions of peasants flocking to cities for jobs because rural
factories are shutting down.
   Recession, Yang added, will cause a ``blow to social and
economic stability (that) will be worse than that caused by
inflation.''
   It is precisely the communist government's phobia of social
discontent over price increases that caused it to order the
economic slowdown in September.
   But what began then as a simple cutback on construction, waste
and luxury spending has blossomed into a wide-reaching program to
slow down not only industrial growth but also the pace of economic
and social change.
   Major changes in the structure of the economic system, essential
to senior leader Deng Xiaoping's decade-old reform program, have
been put on hold or rolled back.
   Factories that had been gaining autonomy from the government,
for example, now need permission to expand production or raise
product prices. Orders have gone out to curb worker bonuses, a key
incentive to increase production.
   Plans to decontrol the prices of staple foods, kept artificially
low with heavy government subsidies, have been put off indefinitely.
   Experimental programs to privatize housing and some companies
through stock sales have been directly or indirectly halted.
   A wide range of powers delegated to local and provincial
governments have been reclaimed by Beijing, including budget
autonomy.
   In March, the government announced new taxes on private
businessmen and rural township factories, deliberately putting a
damper on their rapid growth in order to free up scarce electricity
and supplies for less productive state-owned factories.
   Farmers are to be taxed for the first time on crops they sell on
the free market, the main source of greater rural prosperity since
1978.
   Some economists wonder if the government is not overdoing it.
   ``The austerity policy should be implemented at a much easier
pace,'' the Asian-Pacific Economic Times recommended.
   Economist Xiao Zhuoji contended, ``The danger of returning to
the old system is worse than the danger of inflation.''
   The Shanghai-based World Economic Herald, one of China's most
outspoken papers, recently wondered whether the austerity's goal is
to establish order in the free market, as officials say, or to shut
it down.
   Gao Tiesheng, deputy director of policy research at the State
Price Bureau, said that kind of thinking is naive. China's
transportation and information networks are not advanced enough for
Western-style free markets, he said, and too-rapid reforms have
proven inflationary and disruptive.
   He maintained that the austerity is not a retreat but gives
China a chance to put its economic house in order before making
further changes.
   But latest government figures indicate the policies are hitting
wide of the target, curbing vital industries but not luxury
production. Oil and coal output has virtually stopped growing, and
the government had to give top heavy machinery makers an emergency
$810 million bailout.
   Meanwhile the production of color television sets has increased
32 percent despite a new luxury tax.
   For the growing number of unemployed, the government has adopted
pre-reformist damage control. Premier Li Peng told factories to
retain their excess workers rather than ``shift the burden onto
society,'' adding to the 20 million urban workers, or 15 percent of
the labor force, already considered ``hidden unemployed.''
   Chen Lebo, economics editor at the World Economic Herald, called
rural layoffs a ``serious problem.''
   ``Only 10 percent of the rural work force actually works in the
fields,'' he said. ``If we force the rest to return, this will only
reduce overall rural income.''
   The official People's Daily acknowledged unemployment is likely
to get worse and ``the living conditions of some city and township
residents will fall.''
   ``But this is the price we have to pay,'' it said, ``and if not
now, then the price will be even steeper later.''

<HEAD>`Littlest Victims' Is First HDTV Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It might seem that time has passed by CBS' ``The
Littlest Victims,'' an emotional account of Dr. James Oleske's
pioneering research into AIDS in children of six and seven years
ago.
   But the movie is still relevant for its sympathetic portrayal of
minority AIDS victims and the response of the research community
and the Reagan administration in the early months of the AIDS
crisis.
   It may be helped by the fact that it is the first made-for-TV
movie to be shot on high-definition video. It airs Sunday.
   Although it will be years before many viewers will own TV sets
that capture the crisp, almost three-D picture that high-definition
video produces, they might notice a slightly sharper image than
usual.
   On a high-definition monitor, the picture is dramatically
different because HDTV splits the image into twice the number of
lines for transmission as the current TV picture.
   In a screening room in midtown Manhattan, a group of television
critics were joined by Oleske himself to watch ``The Littlest
Victims'' on a big-screen, high-definition TV set. The portly,
gray-haired Oleske is portrayed in the movie by a handsome, svelte
Tim Matheson.
   ``After the first 15 minutes, I said to myself, `I look a little
bit like this guy,''' Oleske joked after the screening. ``My kids
couldn't understand how a tall, thin, handsome guy could play a
short, fat doctor.''
   Oleske said he has lost about 40 pounds since the events of
1982-83 portrayed in the movie. A subplot is about his battle with
heart disease due to overweight.
   But the movie is really about the children who became victims of
acquired immmune deficiency syndrome before scientists even knew
that a virus caused the fatal disease that attacks its victims'
immune systems, rendering them helpless against infection.
   Oleske, a Newark, N.J.-based pediatric immunologist, was
convinced early on that the children he was seeing were suffering
from AIDS they had contracted through their mothers, then a
revolutionary theory. In 1982, AIDS was still considered a gay
men's disease, although it had also begun to turn up in intravenous
drug abusers.
   The movie confronts the social problems surrounding AIDS and the
Reagan administration's slow response to provide research money.
   ``You mean just because it's hitting gays and junkies, nobody
cares?'' an outraged Oleske says in the movie. ``This is not that
kind of country!''
   Later, when he learns that his application for a grant from the
National Institutes of Health has been approved _ but not funded _
he rants to his laboratory assistant, ``The government doesn't give
a damn about the people with AIDS! It's written them off already!
The sooner they die the better!''
   Oleske praised CBS for avoiding unreal characterizations of AIDS
victims to make them more ``sympathetic,'' i.e., white. ``I
congratulate CBS in making a movie that shows what the real story
is,'' that most young victims of AIDS are minority children of
poverty-stricken parents.
   Oleske said doctors must understand the social pressures on
poor, black, inner-city women to have children, often their only
source of self-esteem. When such a woman is told she has a 50
percent chance of having a baby with AIDS, Oleske says, what she
hears is that she has a 50-50 chance of having a healthy baby.
Nevertheless, doctors often respond with disgust when they realize
a woman has become pregnant despite the risks.
   The original title of the movie was ``Innocent Victims.'' It was
changed after Oleske complained that it suggested other victims
must be guilty of something.
   ``It's not that way,'' he said. ``They didn't know. They're all
innocent victims.''
   Oleske said he was ``somewhat embarrassed'' by the central role
of his character in the movie and said attention was due instead to
the dedicated nurses who care for AIDS children. It is still a
struggle to find the money to pay the nurses and keep the research
going, he said. He donated all the money he made on the movie to a
children's hospital.
   ``The only reason I did this _ and my wife would say sold my
soul _ was I needed a social worker desperately, and the money for
this movie would pay for a social worker,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A vast arctic bay dubbed the ``golden
triangle'' for its unparalleled treasure of fish and wildlife may
be spared oil exploration because of the catastrophic effects
nearby of the nation's worst oil spill.
   Three Alaska governors and the stubborn fishermen of Bristol Bay
have appealed to three presidents to ban oil and gas drilling in
the bay, the richest red salmon grounds in the world.
   For 10 years the powerful of Washington brushed aside the pleas
of complainers living far, far away. Last year, nine oil companies
paid $95.4 million to the federal government to search for oil and
gas in Bristol Bay.
   This year, everything's different. Now the 4,500 people of
Bristol Bay, a 44,000-square-mile marine paradise even richer than
devastated Prince William Sound, are pleading their case again,
hoping that the wreck of the tanker Exxon Valdez will prompt
President Bush to hand back the money.
   With millions of fish threatened, thousands of birds dying, and
hundreds of sea otters dead in Prince William Sound, the despairing
fishermen of western Alaska suddenly have environmental clout and
renewed attention to their cause.
   ``I hate to say it, but without a doubt the spill may help us
save Bristol Bay,'' said Sue Flensburg, executive director of the
Bristol Bay Coastal Resource Service Area.
   Until the huge tanker split open last month, the faint, outraged
voices in Bristol Bay, 450 miles southwest of Prince William Sound,
on the very edge of the continent, were literally crying in the
wilderness.
   Oil-company assurances of environmental integrity and safety had
consistently won out.
   ``They always dangled their success in front of us,'' said
Deborah Tennyson, executive director of the Bristol Bay Native
Association.
   ``The oil companies and the feds said, `You're psychotic, you're
paranoid, we've shipped millions of gallons of oil out of Valdez,
we've got caribou grazing under the pipeline, little chicks are
being born at Prudhoe Bay, and the whales come back year after year
to Prince William Sound.'
   ``Well, a massive oil spill is like nuclear war,'' said Mrs.
Tennyson, who fishes along with her whole family during salmon
season.
   ``If it happens once it would be so horrible that saying,
`Sorry, we'll never do it again,' doesn't mean a damned thing. If
something like this happened in Bristol Bay it would be a cultural,
economic, and social holocaust.''
   Bristol Bay supports the world's largest red salmon fishery and
the largest herring fishery in U.S. waters, as well as a majority
of the world's northern fur seal population, the Pacific gray whale
population, and millions of seabirds, geese and ducks.
   To most Alaskans, the arguments for Bristol Bay boil down to
pure economics. A barrel of oil is worth about $20; most of the
year, a nine-pound Bristol Bay red salmon retails in Anchorage for
$74.25. Salmon is more plentiful than oil here, they say, and it is
a resource that renews itself.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper claims Bristol Bay's wholesale fishery
value exceeds $1 billion and employs 10,000 people in a good year.
   ``It's always been obvious to us that our annual, renewable
resources far outweigh any potential oil and gas gains,'' said Ms.
Flensburg. ``Once oil is gone, it's gone forever, but our fish come
back every year. Why can't the federal government understand that?''
   The oil companies have pressed ahead with Bristol Bay plans
despite surveys that show limited oil deposits at best, and a
warning from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dating back to 1978
that no adequate safeguards could protect Bristol Bay because of
strong tidal currents, severe winds, earthquakes, and heavy ice.
   Ten patches in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas totaling
480 million acres of ocean bottom have been identified by
geologists as potential Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas fields.
   The Interior Department pegs Bristol Bay's hydrocarbon potential
in the Bering Sea among the lowest in that OCS area, with perhaps
as little as 2 percent of the nation's undiscovered offshore
resources.
   Experts estimate the area contains anywhere between 63 million
and 615 million barrels of oil. By contrast, the Prudhoe Bay fields
which feed the trans-Alaska pipeline are estimated at 10 billion
barrels.
   At the most, Bristol Bay could amount to only about a month's
worth of oil consumption for the nation.
   Alaska officials, acutely aware that oil royalties now account
for more than 80 percent of the state's revenue, long ago learned
to coexist with the multinational energy companies and federal
regulators.
   Although state coffers don't gain a cent from drilling outside
Alaska's three-mile limit, former Governors Jay Hammond and Bill
Sheffield, as well as Cowper, all supported OCS leasing _ except in
Bristol Bay.
   But Alaska's decade-old effort to exclude Bristol Bay from OCS
sales was stymied by the reluctance of its own congressional
delegation to fight exploration, and the adamant refusal of
Presidents Carter and Reagan to exclude the bay from Interior
Department leasing.
   With nearly unanimous support from environmentalists and
fishermen, Alaska turned to the courts for help.
   ``This region is commonly referred to as the `golden
triangle,''' wrote Lance Trasky of the Alaska Department of Fish
and Game, during the lengthy litigation. ``These fish and wildlife
resources have great social and economic value ... to the world.''
   Last October, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
rejected the state's appeal. Immediately thereafter, bids were
opened and 23 tracts were leased by nine oil companies at an
average price of $783.87 an acre.
   Shell Western E&amp;P and Chevron USA, the two big winners,
announced plans to begin surveying as early as this summer, with
drilling to follow as soon as permits were obtained.
   In a last-ditch letter to Bush 24 days before the Prince William
Sound disaster, Cowper urged him to defer leasing long enough to
study environmental impacts of an oil spill in Bristol Bay.
   So far Cowper has had no reply from the White House.
   Alaska's Senate added its plea last week, unanimously passing a
resolution urging the federal government to hold up Bristol Bay
exploration.
   Hammond, the former governor and a Bristol Bay resident, agrees
that the politicians and oil companies have been listening to
Alaskans for years, but not hearing them.
   Like many, he feels the Prince William Sound disaster ``may be
the death knell to Bristol Bay leasing'' because of the nightmarish
potential if a spill happened here.
   But as a battle-scarred veteran of two decades of Alaskan
political infighting, the man who was governor throughout the
building of the trans-Alaska pipeline is also a realist.
   ``I am optimistic there's a substantially greater impediment to
Bristol Bay leasing today,'' said Hammond, ``but I am not
optimistic it will never be done. After all, this is Alaska.''
   Unhappily, Dillingham Mayor Joe McGill agreed.
   ``I liked living here so much better before electricity, taxes,
and lawyers,'' sighed McGill.
   ``When the oil companies are really ready to do it, they'll do
it. Hell, they're a lot bigger than a bunch of fishermen _ and
money in Alaska always talks.''

   Today the small villages clinging to
the edge of the Bering Sea are springing to life with anticipation:
it's almost salmon season again, the high point of the year.
   Everything in Ekuk and Chignik, Aleknagik and Igiugig, and the
other 26 tiny settlements scattered around Bristol Bay takes on a
sense of urgency as Aleuts, Indians, Eskimos, and whites prepare
for the commercial fishing season.
   Mending nets, checking engines, painting hulls _ men, women, and
children whose entire annual income depends on their success on the
sea are now scrambling to be ready for that momentous day when the
salmon run.
   ``You forget everything else until after fishing season,'' said
Dillingham Mayor Joe McGill, a commercial fisherman in Bristol Bay
since 1947. ``That's all that matters. Dillingham goes from a
sleepy little town to a crazy metropolis.''
   The blazing summer Arctic sun now rises higher in the sky,
melting the bay's icepack and hundreds of inches of snow on boats
in the storage yard. This town of 1,570 becomes a hub for boat
repair, transportation, and speculation about the season ahead.
   Wills they had money.''
   The series also stars Bernard Hepton as a man whose life is
ruined when Gorse seduces his lady friend; Rosemary Leach as his
girlfriend; Fiona Fullerton as a wealthy debutante; Abigail McKern
as the daughter of a wealthy automobile dealer, and Judy Parfitt as
a war widow.
   Havers is best-known for his feature film roles, but he also
appears on television in his native England.
   His most recent movie is ``Farewell to the Kind,'' which
co-stars Nick Nolte. He also starred in ``Chariots of Fire,'' ``The
Whistle Blower,'' ``Empire of the Sun,'' ``A Passage to India'' and
``Burke and Willis.''
   Prior to coming here, he had completed a TV miniseries in
Australia called ``Naked Under the Sun.'' He was returning to
England to star in another series, ``The Long-Haired Boy,'' as a
World War II fighter pilot. Other TV roles include ``Nancy Astor,''
``Edward, the King,'' ``Churchill: The Wilderness Years,'' ``Death
of the Heart,'' and the Noel Coward ``Star Quality'' series.
   Havers is also planning a documentary on the Whirling Dervishes,
a mystical Islamic order found chiefly in Turkey. They picked up
their name because they whirl and dance to the music of a reed pipe
as part of their worship ceremony.
   ``I've known about them for a long time and I've always wanted
to do something on them,'' he said. ``I have financing from an
independent outfit and it'll probably be for BBC. I have permission
from the Turkish government to film them. You might find them all
over the world. It's like a secret sect. To become a Whirling
Dervish you have to study for two years.''
   Havers has also been cast to play David Niven in ``The Moon's a
Balloon,'' based on Niven's memoir. It's been temporarily shelved.
   ``Too many producers and not enough direction,'' said Havers.
``We'll sort that out later.''

   No superheroes grace the pages of
Javier Juarez's comic books, no archvillains with maniacal plots to
control the world, and not a single ``Pow!'' ``Zap!'' or ``Bam!''
   Even so, the black-and-white adventures of ``Felipe'' and his
friends as they try to conquer a mountain of bureaucratic obstacles
to become legal U.S. residents may be the most dog-eared literature
in California.
   Distributed free at employment offices, churches and social
service agencies, the booklets are lessons in applying for
residency under the complex 1986 Immigration Reform and Control
Act, better known as the amnesty program.
   ``Amnistia'' or ``Amnesty,'' about applying for temporary
residency, was out of print soon after the release of 50,000 copies
a year ago. ``The Second Phase,'' about permanent residency and
avoiding disqualification, is in its second printing four months
after distribution of the first 30,000 copies.
   ``We've never had this kind of response with any material
before,'' said Emily Goldfarb, executive director of the San
Francisco-based Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and
Services, which produced the books.
   The potential audience in California exceeds 1.58 million, the
number of applicants for residency status under the amnesty program.
   ``All this subject matter is deadly boring if you aren't
affected by it. If you are affected by it, it's not deadly boring _
it's terrifyingly boring,'' said Juarez, 39, a former Mexican
government economist who got the idea after he married a U.S.
citizen and moved from Mexico City to California.
   So Juarez lightened it up, capitalizing on the gallows humor and
love of storytelling he said is the heritage of Mexico, where
political cartooning has enjoyed a long tradition and soap
opera-style novellas are popular.
   ``Lots of people say, `Why a comic book? That's for a kid or the
mentally retarded.' There's nothing comic about the situations
portrayed in the comic books. Actually, it's a matter of life and
death. It's going to determine where they live and work. But
there's no reason to lose your sense of humor.''
   When the characters discuss the difficulties of obtaining
documents and witnesses' sworn statements to prove they've been in
the country since Jan. 1, 1982 _ the cutoff date for amnesty
applications _ Felipe laments: ``Even my mother-in-law wanted to
use the opportunity to get rid of me.''
   The idea was so good that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which had said it couldn't afford to produce Juarez's
book, followed suit. The government version also proved popular,
said Scott Nyborn, outreach coordinator with the INS in San
Francisco. ``I don't think we have any left, actually.''
   Juarez writes the scripts in Spanish, then translates them for
English editions. A former student of dramatic arts, he gets help
with illustrations from his media-wise family _ his father works in
advertising, his brother in film-making, and his sister is a
television director in Mexico.
   He strives to write the scripts in the idioms of everyday
Spanish, while accurately imparting information about the amnesty
program _ a task that can be a ``nightmare'' because experts
frequently disagree on the complex law.
   Goldfarb believes that unlike with government brochures, people
hang onto the comics and read them aloud to their families,
reaching illiterate people who otherwise might be misinformed or
exploited by swindlers.
   ``They're fun to read,'' she said. ``The graphics and the
conversations and the cultural aspects of it are things that people
can identify with.''
   ``Amnistia'' dealt with the first phase of the amnesty program,
but applying for residency is just the first step. The application
dealines were May 5, 1988, for aliens here since 1982 and Nov. 30
for seasonal agriculture workers who had picked perishable crops at
least 90 days between May 1985 and May 1986.
   The second phase deals with permanent residency and problems
like arrests, unemployment and welfare dependancy that can make
applicants ineligible.
   Two more issues are in the works to address mandated AIDS tests;
qualifying for government assistance including free and
reduced-price school lunches and prenatal and infant medical care,
and meeting requirements for a basic understanding of English, and
American civics and history.
   If the next issue wins a state grant, Goldfarb said the
Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition plans to print 70,000 copies
for distribution by its 80 nonprofit member organizations in the
San Francisco Bay area, then make it available to other
organizations throughout the state to reprint.
   Juarez said the widespread readership is its own reward and has
inspired him to try producing as his next project an analytical
Spanish-English language magazine for California's rapidly growing
Hispanic population.

<HEAD>Roe vs. Wade Was Just the Start for the Supreme Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Supreme Court legalized abortion in
1973, the justices stepped into an intense national debate they
have continued to shape with a series of important decisions.
   In the 16 years since the Roe vs. Wade ruling, the court
generally has reinforced the right to abortion while limiting
accessibility for minors and women on welfare.
   ``Every case since Roe has effectively reaffirmed and built on
it,'' said Lynn Paltrow, a lawyer with the Reproductive Freedom
Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. But, she added,
``For the most vulnerable women in our society _ minors and the
poor _ the court has limited access to abortion.''
   The passing years also have seen a dwindling court majority for
upholding the privacy right to have an abortion that the justices
established in 1973.
   That trend, reflecting the court's changing membership, is a key
factor as the justices examine an abortion regulation case from
Missouri. They are being asked to use the case to overturn or
substantially limit the 1973 ruling.
   The court will hear arguments on the Missouri law Wednesday with
a decision expected by July.
   John C. Willke, who heads the National Right to Life Committee
that opposes abortion rights, said erosion of court support for Roe
vs. Wade reflects more than just the politics of the day. The
concept behind Roe vs. Wade ``is so shot full of holes that it
cannot stand much longer,'' he said.
   The 1973 decision legalized abortion nationwide for the first
time. The 7-2 ruling said a woman's decision to have an abortion in
the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her
doctor. It said states may interfere in the abortion decision
during the second trimester only to protect the woman's health but
that states may take steps to protect fetal life only in the third
trimester.
   Marcy Wilder of the National Abortion Rights Action League said
the court could decline to overturn Roe vs. Wade and still do great
damage to women's access to safe and legal abortions.
   If the justices uphold the Missouri law, she said, ``There will
be a political firestorm'' as state legislatures and interest
groups seek to impose new restrictions on how, when, where and why
abortions may be performed.
   ``The restrictions would get more severe and more severe,'' Ms.
Wilder said. ``The right would become hollow. It would be saying,
`Get an abortion if you can find one.'''
   Here is a chronology of the Supreme Court's other major
decisions on abortion:
   _On the same day as the Roe vs. Wade decision, Jan. 22, 1973,
the court struck down, by a 7-2 vote, restrictions on facilities
that could be used to perform abortions. The decision gave rise to
a new kind of medical facility, the abortion clinic.
   _In 1976, the court, by a 6-3 vote, said states cannot give a
husband veto power over his wife's decision to abort her pregnancy.
By a separate 5-4 vote, the court said parents of minor, unwed
girls cannot have such an absolute veto.
   _In 1977, the court, 6-3, ruled that states have no legal
obligation to pay for ``non-therapeutic'' abortions.
   _In 1979, the court voted 6-3 to reaffirm its intention to give
doctors broad discretion in determining ``viability'' _ when a
fetus can live outside the mother's womb.
   _Later than year, the court by an 8-1 vote elaborated on its
parental consent decision of 1976. It implied that states may be
able to require an unmarried minor to obtain parental consent to an
abortion so long as the state law provides an alternative procedure
to parental approval, such as letting the minor seek a state
judge's approval instead.
   _In 1980, the court ruled, 5-4, that the federal government and
individual states do not have to pay for abortions, even medically
necessary ones, for women on welfare.
   _In 1981, the court ruled by a 6-3 vote that states may require
doctors consulted by some young girls to try to inform the parents
before performing a requested abortion.
   _In 1983, the court, 6-3, said states and local communities may
not require all abortions for women more than three months pregnant
to be performed in a hospital.
   The court also struck down regulations that, among other things,
imposed a 24-hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a ``human life.''
   _In 1986, the court voted 5-4 to strike down Pennsylvania
abortion regulations requiring doctors to inform women seeking
abortions about potential risks and about available medical
assistance benefits for prenatal care and childbirth.
   The court also struck down requirements that two doctors always
be present for abortions performed in the third trimester, a rare
procedure, and that such abortions use methods which pose the least
risk to a fetus capable of surviving outside the womb.
   _In 1987, a 4-4 split of the justices had the effect of
invalidating an Illinois law that could have made abortions more
difficult to obtain for some teen-agers.
   The decision was announced two months before Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy joined the court, replacing retired Justice Lewis F. Powell.

   Cannon greeted the gray dawn at the tip of
Manhattan with a 13-gun salute on April 30, 1789, signaling the
start of what one newspaper correspondent called ``one of the most
august and interesting spectacles ever exhibited on this globe.''
   Gen. George Washington was in town, to be inaugurated as
president of the United States. It was an event fraught with
symbolism: a new leader of a new country with a new kind of
government.
   ``These upstart colonial types, they were in the forefront of an
age of experiments in government,'' says Richard B. Bernstein,
historian with the city's Commission on the Bicentennial of the
Constitution. ``And this ceremonial event was an event not just in
the country's history, but in human history.''
   The city is celebrating the inauguration's bicentennial with a
week of historic re-enactments, fireworks extravaganzas and
parades. President Bush is expected to attend next Sunday for the
re-creation of Washington's swearing-in.
   By 9 a.m. of that historic day the sun was out and by noon the
crowds packed the dozen blocks from Washington's rented home at 3
Cherry St. to Federal Hall at Broad and Wall streets. More than
20,000 people turned out by some estimates, in a city of about
30,000.
   ``I'm not sure everybody in the city was there, but this was an
event people felt they had to be at. This was the launching of the
government,'' Bernstein said.
   Washington had been elected unanimously in February because ``he
was the only true national political figure of his time,''
Bernstein said.
   For those who filled the streets of the city, Washington
embodied the hopes and dreams for the new nation.
   ``As Madison said, the only aspect of the new government the
people believed in was Washington,'' said J.T. Flexner, author of
an acclaimed four-volume biography of the first president.
   That was true even if most people were not sure what Washington
looked like.
   ``There were a certain number of engravings, but on the whole
you had no idea what the guy looked like,'' Flexner said. ``But
automatically he was recognized as a great man. He looked so much
the office.
   ``Just by looking at him, they knew he was commander-in-chief.
It was his dignity, and he was a very big man for those days,''
about 6-foot-3.
   The crowd finally got its chance to glimpse the man around noon,
when a congressional party arrived at Cherry Street to fetch him.
   Washington had dressed carefully. A suit of brown broadcloth
spun in Hartford, Conn., had been selected. It was a political, not
a fashion, statement; he wanted to advertise ``domestic
manufactures.''
   More important, Bernstein said, the brown suit proclaimed: ``I
am a civilian; I am George Washington, Esquire; I am a citizen of
the United States of America. I am not General George Washington.''
   Washington's hair was powdered. The stockings were silk, the
shoe buckles silver, as were the suit's buttons, decorated with
eagles. He put on his hat and strapped on his dress sword and steel
scabbard.
   The people outside the home cheered as he emerged and climbed
into a special coach pulled by four horses. The procession wound
through town, through cheering crowds to the recently remodeled
Federal Hall.
   The throng filled the streets and every window; some had
scrambled onto roofs.
   Inside Federal Hall, the doors to the Senate chamber swung open
as Washington approached. All rose, and he bowed to the senators
and foreign dignitaries on his right, and to the representatives on
his left.
   He sat down in front of the central window, Vice President John
Adams to his right, Speaker of the House Frederick Muhlenberg on
his left. It was up to Adams to get things started.
   William Maclay, an irreverent Pennsylvania senator, recalled in
his diary that in the pressure of the moment, Adams ``seemed to
have forgot half of what he was to say for he made a dead pause and
stood for some time, to appearance, in a vacant mood.''
   Adams recovered: ``Sir, the Senate and House of Representatives
are ready to attend you to take the oath required by the
Constitution. It will be administered by the chancellor of the
State of New York.''
   ``I am ready to proceed,'' said Washington.
   Then it was out onto the small second-story porch and into view
of the crowd, which erupted again into cheers. Washington, hand on
heart, bowed repeatedly, then sat on an armchair.
   Dignitaries shuffled onto the small platform. A small table,
draped in red, held a leather-bound Bible resting on a red cushion.
The secretary of the Senate, Samuel A. Otis, picked it up as
Washington rose and moved to the front of the platform, where all
could see.
   Then, quiet.
   Chancellor Robert R. Livingston faced Washington, who put his
hand on the book.
   ``Do you solemnly swear that you will faithfully execute the
office of President of the United States, and will, to the best of
your ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the
United States?''
   Washington repeated the oath, adding the words, ``So help me
God,'' and bowed to kiss the Bible.
   ``It is done,'' Livingston said, then shouted to the crowd,
``Long live George Washington, president of the United States!''
   Otis' son, Harrison Gray Otis, remembered the scene decades
later: ``No one can describe the silent tearful ecstasy which
pervaded the myriads who witnessed that scene, succeeded only by
shouts which seemed to shake the canopy above them.''
   Washington bowed again as the cheering swelled. Another 13-gun
salute boomed from the Battery, while in the harbor a Spanish ship
fired its own salute. Above it all, church bells could be faintly
heard.
   The president walked back inside for his inaugural address to
Congress; then it was another procession to St. Paul's Church; then
a quiet dinner; then the night's celebration.
   ``In the evening,'' Maclay wrote, ``there were grand fire Works.
The Spanish Ambassadors House was adorned with Transparent
paintings, the French Ministers House was illuminated, and had some
transparent pieces. the Hall was grandly illuminated. and after all
this the People went to bed.''

   John Adams was worried.
   The inauguration of George Washington was fast approaching, and
the new vice president fretted over where he should sit, how
Congress should receive him, and how Washington should be formally
addressed.
   After all, it was a new position in a unique form of government.
   Writing in his diary, Sen. William Maclay of Pennsylvania said
Adams worried aloud about Washington's inaugural address: ``How
shall I behave, how shall we receive it, shall it be standing or
sitting?''
   As for Washington's new title, Adams, perhaps looking ahead to a
time when he would become president, liked the sound of ``His Most
Benign Highness.''
   Some senators came up with a designation that was clearly the
product of a committee: ``His Highness the President of the United
States of America and Protector of the Rights of the Same.''
   Washington would have none of that. His friend James Madison
persuaded Congress to follow the Constitution and simply call him
``the President of the United States.''
   ``It reflected his personality, not wanting to be called any of
these fancy things,'' said biographer J.T. Flexner. ``It also
reflected a very deep problem in people's minds.
   ``You've got to remember, there had been no republican
government in the entire world, and there was always a fear you'd
end up with an American king.''

   George Washington's inaugural address sent no
chills down spines among the thousands of spectators outside
Federal Hall.
   They never heard it. And Congress, which he was addressing,
barely heard it.
   The leader of the Continental Army and the symbol of the new
nation delivered his 20-minute speech in a low, quavering voice
that was hard to hear and punctuated with awkward hand gestures.
   Sen. William Maclay of Pennsylvania, who kept a diary, thought
``this great man was agitated and embarrassed more than ever he was
by the levelled Cannon or pointed Musket.''
   J.T. Flexner, author of a four-volume biography of the first
president, says Washington's nervousness and diffident manner
revealed the overwhelming sense of import he was feeling.
   ``The general opinion of the world was that this was a bunch of
crazy people trying to do the impossible,'' Flexner said. ``He had
tremendous responsibility not only to the people, but as president,
to demonstrate that people could rule themselves. He felt this
tremendous responsibility.''
   Washington had abandoned a 73-page speech written earlier and
went with a shorter version that outlined general goals and urged
Congress to avoid ``local prejudices or attachments'' and ``party
animosities.''
   The closest thing to news in the speech was his indirect
endorsement of the Bill of Rights. He asked Congress to quickly
pass amendments showing ``a reverence for the characteristic rights
of freemen and a regard for the public harmony.''
   Another reason for the shaky tone of the address was
Washington's formal manner. He was not a politician, not an orator.
He was a farmer and a soldier.
   ``He was able to be extremely affable and, at the same time,
affable without inviting intimacy,'' Flexner said. ``He was shy. He
hated to have his portrait painted, hated having people stare at
him.''

   Two hundred years ago, George Washington landed
in a barge at the foot of Wall Street, amid colonial homes, banks
and offices, for his swearing-in as president of the United States.
   On Sunday, a costumed stand-in for the first president is making
a grand entrance _ for convenience's sake _ at a pier at South
Street Seaport, a mecca of pricey boutiques and trendy eating
places.
   Other festivities in a week-long celebration of the bicentennial
of Washington's inauguration will follow suit, tempering historical
accuracy with modern realities and showbiz glitz.
   Next Sunday, New Yorkers will relive Washington's inauguration
of April 30, 1789, with a flotilla of military ships, a fireworks
extravaganza billed as ``pictures in fire'' of the presidency, and
a parade of military bands and 18th century-style marching units.
   There also will be a re-creation of Washington's swearing-in at
Federal Hall. President Bush is expected to attend. Afterwards, the
new Museum of American Constitutional Government, located in the
hall, will be dedicated.
   Earlier in the week, broadcaster John Chancellor and former
Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance are scheduled to participate in a
symposium on the presidency in the 1990s.
   ``We're not only fireworks and parades,'' said Peter Kohlmann,
the executive director of the city's bicentennial commission.
``We've got substance so people can learn about the significance of
the event.''
   In the opening event, Washington's stand-in, William Sommerfield
of Philadelphia, sails from the municipal pier in Elizabeth, N.J.,
on the barge Shallop, a 1622 coastal vessel, in a 2{-hour trip
across New York Harbor to South Street Seaport's Pier 16.
   Thirteen costumed oarsmen from the Merchant Marine Academy will
row the barge, which is being accompanied by five schooners and the
HMS Rose, a re-creation of a 1757 British gunboat.
   The city kicks off the bicentennial weekend next Saturday with a
presidential flotilla in the harbor. Thirteen U.S. Navy and Coast
Guard ships representing the original states will enter the harbor
and be joined by 50 commercial and civilian vessels coming down the
Hudson River.
   In 1789, there was only one naval vessel in the harbor, a
Spanish frigate, since the U.S. Navy had not yet been formed.
   At night, a fireworks spectacular narrated by Walter Cronkite
will emblazon the sky of lower Manhattan in a pyrotechnical
depiction of the history of the presidency.
   The focal point of the celebration will be the inaugural
commemoration at Federal Hall, marking the moment when Washington
put his hand to the Bible and swore to ``faithfully execute the
office of President of the United States.''
   In the dramatization, Sommerfield will repeat the presidential
oath on the approximate site where Washington did and then deliver
three minutes of his 20-minute inaugural speech.
   Twenty-six people in colonial costume portraying the delegates
from the original 13 states will sit on the dais. Bush, who will be
marking his 101st day in office, is expected to speak.
   The festivities conclude with an 89-unit parade from Federal
Hall to the arch at Washington Square Park, a monument built for
the centennial of Washington's inauguration.

   The middle-aged white woman in the David
Duke sweatshirt was pleasantly enthusiastic.
   ``He's for fair play for all,'' she said of the ex-Ku Klux Klan
leader she had come to hear. ``Right now it's like we've become the
minority and we need someone to do something.''
   Duke, who has made the jump from radical fringe to elected
official, points to such people as proof his message is becoming
mainstream. Now leader of the National Association for the
Advancement of White People, Duke won a seat in the Louisiana
Legislature by talking about the high birthrate among unwed welfare
women and claiming that whites are victimized by civil rights laws.
   ``I think I spoke out loud what a lot of people say around the
dinner table,'' he said. ``People were so impressed by the ideas
that they voted for me despite the controversy of my background.''
   Duke is not alone in his thinking. Much of what he says is
echoed by those who have opposed him throughout his career.
   ``The David Duke election was a signal of a sour mood of
resentment on the part of some whites that has been a long time in
developing,'' said Irwin Suall, director of fact-finding for the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. ``There is a perception out
there that blacks are being favored at the expense of whites, not
merely in employment but in status in the media.''
   Some dismiss Duke's slim, 200-vote victory as an anomaly; his
suburban New Orleans district is 99 percent white. But Suall and
other trackers of racial tension believe disparate events, like
Duke's election and the rise of the racist skinhead subculture, are
warning signs to be taken seriously.
   ``These people and these events represent something larger,''
said Chip Berlet, a researcher for Political Research Associates of
Cambridge, Mass. ``They are like the canaries in mines telling us
there is an undercurrent of people that are very unhappy.''
   This unhappiness, says Berlet and others, runs long and deep. It
is the result of economic changes that have nibbled away at the
blue-collar union tradition; of fear of drugs and crime; of the
perception that civil rights programs like affirmative action are
unfair to whites, and of a general hopelessness within the white
working class that sees a shrinking of its power in society.
   At a shopping mall on the edge of Duke's district, a white woman
in her 30s offered her opinion but declined to give her name:
   ``You see all this about black power and black pride and helping
blacks economically and I guess that started out with good
intentions. But it's not right when whites lose jobs and it's not
fair when you're called a racist for complaining about it.''
   It is difficult to measure this mood. Most polls show the
American public far more tolerant of racial differences and
integration programs than it once was. But Michael McKeon, a
pollster who has worked with the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, said standard surveys that ask yes-no questions can't
plumb the depth of individual attitudes.
   McKeon said his phone surveys, which involve more dialogue with
subjects, show ``big time disenchantment.''
   ``It's nothing you can put a number on, but there is a
resentment out there that the lower middle class, and their
children, aren't going to be any better off than they were,'' he
said. ``If you ask, `Are you mad because your kid didn't get a
scholarship and a black kid did?' they're going to say no. But if
you talk to them you're going to see this resentment woven into the
fabric of their thoughts.''
   Those in the civil rights trenches, like Curt Koehler, an
organizer for the Chicago Commission on Human Relations, note a
simmering anger, especially among young whites.
   ``A growing number of white people in their 20s feel they are on
the short end of the stick,'' said Koehler, who tries to defuse
racial tension in the blue-collar neighborhoods on Chicago's
Southwest side, an area that has seen Klan rallies and violence by
skinheads.
   Koehler said the lower middle-class white bastion of the secure
union job is crumbling. At the same time, the disenchanted see a
growing black middle class moving in and believe it is the result
of favored government treatment.
   ``A black on his way up might have a chance to buy a home in a
neighborhood where a young white kid just saw his job leave,'' he
said. ``The anger is being placed now on black folks and
affirmative action.''
   Beyond the economics is an issue of group identity and pride.
The higher profile of minorities on stage, film and the television
screen gives some whites, already worried about their status, the
sense that their importance in society is diminishing.
   Berlet noted that while relatively few blacks appear on TV,
their numbers have increased so rapidly that their representation
can seem disproportional. ``Blacks make up 15 percent of the
population and maybe only 4 percent on TV,'' he said. ``But when
some whites see ... more black faces on televison, they think
they're taking over.''
   Gregg, a 20-year-old Atlanta skinhead who declined to give his
last name, complained bitterly about what he sees as ``black
propaganda.''
   ``I was watching television and they had these blacks sitting
around, telling everybody it was blacks who invented this and
blacks who invented that. It was abunch of lies,'' he said.
   Bert, a fellow skinhead, sees such concepts as black pride and
black history coming at the expense of white identity.
   ``White heritage is not being taught in school. It's like you're
supposed to be ashamed of being white while they're teaching black
heritage full force,'' he said. ``They completely downplay the role
whites have in this country.''
   These frustrations can blossom into acts of racial violence that
Koehler has seen in his Chicago neighborhoods. ``Or,'' he said,
``these people can vote for a David Duke in the belief they can
protect what is mine.''
   Whether or not that translates into the election of more
candidates with similar ideologies is debated by the pulsetakers of
society.
   Martin Lipset, a Stanford University sociologist, thinks other
white rights candidates may be elected to local office, ``but
they're dead if they have any ambitions to go further.''
   Duke, however, believes he is only the first to tap into a
sentiment that will grow.
   ``I think that this is the beginning of a time when we will see
candidates discuss these things,'' he said. ``A candidate who
doesn't have to carry the political baggage I had to carry and who
discusses these issues will win.''

   For all their vitriol, racial hate groups in the
United States are swimming against a steady tide of public opinion:
While prejudice remains, polls show, it has been declining steadily
for years.
   Groups such as the loosely organized neo-Nazi skinheads, who
were assembling with white supremacists in Idaho this weekend,
represent a minuscule minority with no trend in broader opinion
behind them, pollsters said in interviews last week.
   ``You always have kook groups around,'' said Tom Smith, director
of the long-running General Social Survey at the National Opinion
Research Center. ``I don't see any sign that they're tapping a vein
of discontent.''
   Still, even as polls track general declines in racism, they do
find lingering prejudice, particularly among older whites in the
rural South. And whites overall remain far more sanguine than
blacks about race relations.
   ``There's no doubt that there is a lot of racism in American
society,'' Smith said. ``To say that we are a racially color-blind
society is nonsense. But to say there's hasn't been enormous
progress is also misguided.''
   He pointed, for example, to support for busing to achieve racial
balance in public schools. Thirty-four percent of American adults
polled by NORC supported busing in 1988 _ a minority but well up
from 16 percent in 1976.
   Similarly, while 23 percent said last year that they favored
laws against interracial marriage, that was down from 30 percent in
1980. Other measures, from willingness to vote for a black for
president to acceptance of racial diversity in schools and
neighborhoods, also show increasing tolerance.
   Pollsters note, however, that expressions of tolerance can be
misleading. While most whites say they would vote for a qualified
black for president, for example, most also say no black has such
qualifications now.
   ``Generally the trend has been helpful. A lot of folks out there
think racism is wrong and would like to believe it's a problem
that's going behind us,'' said Steve Ralston, deputy director of
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ``But blacks still
feel the effects of racism very much.''
   In a recent Harris poll, for example, 70 percent of whites said
most blacks received equal pay for equal work, while only 40
percent of blacks agreed. In a Media General-Associated Press poll,
57 percent of whites said blacks and other minorities had the same
opportunities as whites, but only 28 percent of blacks agreed.
   ``Across the board, whites think blacks are treated better than
blacks think blacks are treated,'' said Ron Bass, a pollster for
Louis Harris and Associates. ``Whites think blacks have made a lot
of progress in terms of attaining equality. Blacks don't feel that
way at all.''
   Polls, however, do not support the thesis that white Americans
are growing disenchanted with government efforts to address past
discrimination. While such programs have never been broadly
popular, said Smith, support for them has held steady or increased,
not declined.
   In NORC polls, for instance, support for more spending on
``improving the conditions of blacks'' rose from 26 percent in 1978
to 38 percent a decade later, while those who wanted less money
committed to the effort fell from 27 percent to 17 percent. The
bulk each year said spending was about right.
   Questions on affirmative action are among the most sensitive,
because of a resistance among Americans to the perception of
preferential treatment for any group, Smith said. A Harris poll
asking if respondents favored ``affirmative action programs in
employment for blacks, provided there are no rigid quotas,'' found
74 percent in support. But the same question using different
language in a Media General-Associated Press poll _ should blacks
and other minorities ``receive preference in hiring to make up for
past inequalities'' _ found 79 percent opposed.
   Nevertheless, when the question has been asked over time, Smith
said, polls have not found any growing opposition to affirmative
action.
   Even with the poll results, Ralston, of the NAACP Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, said he was concerned about anecdotal reports
that could indicate increased racial intolerance, ranging from
racially divided voting in Chicago's mayoral election to the 1986
racial attack in the Howard Beach neighborhood of New York City.
   Gauging from the sentiments in surveys, ``The trend is in the
right direction,'' Ralston said. ``But we've got a ways to go yet.''

<HEAD>Legendary Actress to Receive Lincoln Center Honor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The red brick apartment house just south of
the Sunset Strip is so handsomely crafted and so venerable by
California standards it has been designated a national monument. So
has the lady on the fourth floor.
   Bette Davis has been accorded almost every honor possible for a
film actress: two Academy Awards, the American Film Institute and
Kennedy Center awards for lifetime achievement and more. One has
been missing, and that will be corrected April 24 when she is
honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center.
   ``This is sort of the last big one I haven't received, and I'm
very pleased. It took me a long time to receive the Kennedy Center.
So I say, better late than never. I must say I've never gotten
blase about honors. It's great, it's wonderful,'' she said.
   The apartment is spacious yet bears little evidence of her
studio years. The exception is a large painting of Davis, around
1950 when she made ``All About Eve.'' The room was fragrant with
floral bouquets sent for her 81st birthday April 5. ``It was a
wonderful family day, lots of flowers, lots of calls,'' she said.
   The actress looked stylish in a black top and black skirt filled
with yellow daisies. Half a lifetime after the portrait on the
wall, her face shows evidence of severe illness. Yet her ash-blonde
hair is as lovely as ever, and she retains a regal beauty. The
voice still crackles with no-nonsense authority, and she still
unapologetically smokes cigarettes.
   In a recent interview, she sat in an easy chair, leaning against
a small pillow bearing the legend in needlepoint: ``No Guts, No
Glory.'' Is that a Davis motto?
   ``Oh, yes. Totally,'' she declared. ``It's the truth. To dare to
be hated _ that takes guts.''
   Her recent history has borne out her credo. She survived a
mastectomy and a disfiguring stroke. She weathered an attack by
daughter B.D. Hyman in the 1985 book, ``My Mother's Keeper.''
Davis' own book, ``This 'n' That'' (1987) was rejected by a
publisher, but she advertised it in Publisher's Weekly, found
another publisher and had a best seller.
   Last year, she left ``Wicked Stepmother'' in the middle of
filming to have dental work in New York. Claiming differences with
the director, she didn't return, and the thriller was finished
without her.
   She shrugs off such matters and talks more positively about
other things, such as the miracle year of 1939, the greatest
outpouring of movie classics in Hollywood history. Astonishingly,
she starred in four memorable films that year: ``Dark Victory,''
``Juarez,'' ``The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex'' and ``The
Old Maid.''
   This is also the golden anniversary of ``Gone With the Wind,''
``The Wizard of Oz,'' ``Wuthering Heights,'' ``Stagecoach'' and
``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' Why such a creative explosion?
   ``I don't know,'' Davis said. ``I did about 10 films in a row,
starting in 1939, and I was pretty tired when it was all over. But
that series of films made this career permanent. Many of them were
based on great plays. There are no plays anymore. (Today's films
are about) diseases and nonfiction.
   ``I'll feel very happy, too, that I was a black-and-white-era
woman. Oh, yes. It gave you so much more variety; color is so
`pretty.'
   ``They wanted to make `(Whatever Happened to Baby) Jane' in
color. I said, `I won't make it if it's in color.' I couldn't
possibly have worn the makeup in color. ... The shadows and the
lights and all of those great cameramen, like Ernie Haller! I
happened to see `All This and Heaven, Too' the other night. Ah! I
was a lucky woman. The women of today don't have such cameramen. I
don't think people care anymore.''
   Is she appalled by the coloring of film classics?
   ``It's worse than appalled. It's heartbroken. I saw `Dark
Victory' in color. The bright pink blouse and the bright blue
skirt, and all the faces and the sets are pink. So all the good
taste of the set people, the wardrobe people, the actors is
ruined.''
   She was born Ruth Elizabeth Davis in Lowell, Mass., and like
Katharine Hepburn, her life has been instilled with Yankee
indomitability. After minor stage work, she landed in Hollywood
with a Universal contract, making her film debut in 1931 with ``Bad
Sister.'' She was fired for having ``as much sex appeal as Slim
Summerville,'' the studio's tall, skinny comic.
   The young actress was headed back to the stage when an offer
came from Warner Bros. The studio used her for leg art and ingenue
roles until she was loaned to RKO for ``Of Human Bondage'' in 1934.
Her portrayal of the slatternly waitress was galvanizing. Her first
Oscar came the next year for an inconsequential film,
``Dangerous,'' consolation prize for losing in 1934. She won again
for ``Jezebel'' in 1939.
   Jack Warner realized he had a major star, and Davis' roles
became more formidable. But she was dissatisfied with how she was
treated, and she tried to break her contract by fleeing to England.
Warner won a suit to force her return.
   ``Jack was gracious afterward,'' she recalled. ``If you lose a
case, you have to pay both lawyers' fees. He did not make me pay
his lawyers. He was very, very good when I came home. I got better
directors, better scripts.''
   She remained at Warners for 18 years, leaving after the
disastrous ``Beyond the Forest'' in 1949. Her next movie was ``All
About Eve,'' another of her 10 Academy nominations. She has
continued working in films, television and lectures, always in the
patented Davis style and despite tragedy.
   Personal disasters have not prompted Davis to abandon her
65-year passion for acting. Her greatest hope is to make a film on
the life of the late beauty tycoon Helena Rubinstein. ``I've got a
good script, and I'll do it,'' she said with customary resolve.
   She also would like to resume ``The Bette Davis Show,'' a
traveling act featuring exchanges between the star and the audience
and clips of her movies. She recalled her favorite story:
   ``I was appearing for three nights at the Palladium in London. A
woman at the back of the theater screamed at me: ``Miss Davis, have
you had your face lifted?'
   ``I got down on my knees in back of the footlights and said,
`Come here!' This poor woman and the whole audience was worried.
She didn't know whether I was going to punch her or say, `God damn
you' or what. So I faced her over the footlights and said, `If I
had, wouldn't I look a lot better?'''
   She gave the hearty Bette Davis laugh, blinked those Bette Davis
eys and lighted another cigarette.

<TEXT>
   When an ash-blonde with bright saucer eyes told
a wimpy Richard Barthelmess, ``I'd love to kiss yuh, but I jest
washed ma ha-yer'' in 1932's ``Cabin in the Cotton,'' the world
knew there could be only one Bette Davis.
   In the scores of movies that followed, she created memorable
roles and delivered deathless lines in her clipped, hard-edged
voice.
   She was ruthless as the slutty Mildred in 1934's ``Of Human
Bondage,'' tearing the gentle Leslie Howard to shreds:
   ``You cad! You dirty swine! I never cared for you, not once. I
was always making a fool of you. You bored me stiff. I hated you.
It made me sick when I had to let you kiss me. I only did it
because you begged me. You hounded me. You drove me crazy. And,
after you kissed me, I always used to wipe my mouth _ wipe my mouth
_ but I made up for it. For every kiss, I had to laugh.''
   As a husband-killer in ``Bordertown'' (1934), she rails about
her boredom. ``The only fun I get is feeding the goldfish, and they
only eat once a day!''
   Davis' characters were rarely made for small towns and the slow
lane. They dreamed big _ at any cost.
   ``If I don't get out of here, I'll just die! Living here is like
waiting for the funeral to begin. No, it's like waiting in the
coffin for them to carry you out!'' she laments in ``Beyond the
Forest'' (1949).
   And in the same movie, she says, ``What a dump!''
   The off-repeated line is usually applied with venom, but that's
not the way the actress played it in the movie.
   ``That has nothing to do with me,'' she said in an interview.
``That is completely Mr. (Edward) Albee and Elizabeth Taylor
(playwright and star of the film `Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'). I made nothing of it. I walked up to a table, dusted it
and said, `What a dump.' You hardly hear me say it.''
   Her passions do flare when her characters turn to crime.
   In ``Bordertown,'' she tells Paul Muni, her sleazy lawyer-lover:
``I made you rich. I put those swell clothes on your back. Now,
just because you got your neck washed, you think you're a
gentleman. No one can make you that. You're riffraff, and so am I.
You belong to me, and you'll stay with me. You bet you're going to
stay with me because I'm holding on to you. Why, I committed murder
to get you.''
   Later, in 1940's ``The Letter,'' Davis kills her lover and
unflinchingly tells her husband, ``With all my heart, I still love
the man I killed.''
   But there was another Davis screen image, a gentle, almost naive
girlishness.
   ``Now, Voyager'' was a triple-hanky treat with Paul Henreid as
the object of her doomed love affair. Who will ever forget Henreid,
with a smoky, sexy glance, lighting two cigarettes and giving Davis
one?
   ``Oh, I'm such a fool _ such an old fool. These are only tears
of gratitude _ an old maid's gratitude for the crumbs offered. ...
You see, no one ever called me darling before,'' she tells him.
   And when she accepts death in ``Dark Victory,'' she turns to
George Brent: ``Nothing can hurt us now. What we have can't be
destroyed. That's our victory _ our victory over the dark. It is a
victory because we're not afraid.''
   As she matured, Davis' lines, especially those regarding women,
relationships and love, became more philosophical but still had an
acerbic wit:
   _ ``There comes a time in every woman's life when the only thing
that helps is a glass of champagne.'' _ ``Old Acquaintance'' (1943).
   _ ``Oh, it's incredible, utterly incredible. Perched up on that
pinnacle of masculine ego, looking down at poor, weak, defenseless
females _ and pitying them because they don't have beards.'' _
``June Bride'' (1948).
   _ ``Funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on
your way up the ladder so you can move faster. You forget you'll
need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one
career all females have in common, whether we like it or not: being
a woman. Sooner or later we've got to work at it. ... And, in the
last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up or turn
around in bed _ and there he is. Without that, you're not a woman.
You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of
clippings, but you're not a woman.'' _ ``All About Eve'' (1950).
   Joseph L. Mankiewicz' ``All About Eve'' was one of the wittiest
and most literate movies ever to roll out of Hollywood. It had a
champagnecast that included Anne Baxter, Thelma Ritter, Marilyn
Monroe and George Sanders as the viperish theater critic Addison
DeWitt.
   Davis, as the aging actress Margo Channing, was even more
clipped in her delivery:
   _ To ruthless ingenue Eve Harrington after accepting a
prestigious drama award and telling the audience that her heart
will always be in the theater: ``Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't
worry too much about your heart. You can always put that award
where your heart ought to be.''
   _ To her housekeeper, Birdie, after learning Eve has tried to
steal her boyfriend: ``Fasten your seat belts. It's going to be a
bumpy night!''
   Davis doesn't think of the famous line as being a show-stopper.
``It's just a wonderful line you have as the character,'' she said.
   ``Flying into Australia one time I was invited into the cockpit
to look out and see the harbor and all. On cue as I went through
the door, the `Fasten your seat belts' sign came on, and the entire
plane load absolutely died laughing. It was just as if we had
planned it.''

<HEAD>In an Ellington Mood: 90th Anniversay of Duke Ellington's Birth</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``I love you madly.''
   _ Duke Ellington, to his audience at every perfomance.

<TEXT>
   His mistress was music and his passion jazz. And
his genius was the ability to easily execute his ideas, whether
with a full orchestra or a mere piano.
   Edward Kennedy ``Duke'' Ellington was one of the greatest
American composers of the 20th century, a band leader, arranger and
pianist who helped hone jazz into a fine art for half a century. He
would have been 90 on April 29, and friends, family and fans are
commemorating the anniversary of his birth with concerts and
remembrances.
   His son, Mercer, who now leads the celebrated Ellington Band,
says his father would have been especially delighted about being
honored in Washington, D.C., his home town.
   Mercer will lead celebrations in both Washington and New York,
where his father and his band became famous at the Cotton Club
starting in 1927. Duke remained in New York and perfected his
compositions. He died there at age 75 on May 24, 1974.
   On April 27, Mercer will participate in a symposium at the
Smithsonian Institution and lay a cornerstone. The house where Duke
Ellington was born has been torn down. When the developer was told
the significance of the site, he named his new structure the Duke
Ellington Building.
   On April 28, the Ellington Band will play at the Beacon Theater
in New York. The first half will be ``A Drum Is a Woman,''
choreographed by Mercedes Ellington, the oldest of Mercer's four
children. She danced in ``No! No! Nanette!'' and ``Sophisticated
Ladies,'' a musical of Duke Ellington tunes, on Broadway and now
heads her own company, DancEllington. The Anne Swain Clark Singers
also will participate.
   ``A Drum Is a Woman,'' an allegorical history of jazz, was first
performed on the U.S. Steel Hour on CBS-TV in 1957, with Talley
Beatty dancing the part of Caribee Joe opposite Carmen de Lavallade
as Mme. Zzaj (jazz spelled backwards). Duke narrated.
   ``That was a project he and Orson Welles had,'' Mercer said.
``Orson put him on a fabulous salary and they would party like mad
dogs. The boss asked, `Where is the music?' Orson got fired. `A
Drum Is a Woman' was some of the work from that project. It was
made into a record album and from the album it went onto TV.''
   They also will perform ``Ansellia'' (a black orchid), which
Mercer composed for Mercedes when she was 7.
   The band returns to Washington for a parade across the Duke
Ellington Bridge on April 29 and a concert at the Smithsonian. The
Smithsonian will also have showings of ``Paris Blues'' and
``Anatomy of a Murder'' and a month-long exhibit of Ellington
memorabilia and the art of Gaye Ellington, his granddaughter.
   On April 30, the band will squeeze into the Cates Restaurant and
Jazz Club in Washington. They'll have to play from memory, Mercer
said, because the club is too small to hold bandstands as well as
the musicians.
   The Ellington Band has released a new Musicmasters recording,
``Music Is My Mistress,'' taken from the title of Ellington's 1973
autobiography. It's a followup to ``Digital Duke,'' on GRP Records,
which won a Grammy in 1988. Musicmasters also has a new ``Four
Symphonic Works by Duke Ellington,'' which are ``Harle,'' ``Black,
Brown and Beige,'' ``New World a Comin''' and ``Three Black
Kings,'' by the American Composers Orchestra, conducted by Maurice
Peress.
   Mercer, a graduate of the Juilliard School, has lived through
the traumas of growing up the son of a famous father. He's now
secure as the keeper of the flame and is freer to be himself.
   ``I'm not fending off anything anymore. If you can wind up being
as close to him as possible, you're still going to be different and
your own person,'' he said.
   Mercer's best-known composition is ``Things Ain't What They Used
to Be.''
   ``When I go to write music, I'm sometimes surprised they come
off close to what Duke's sound would have been,'' he said. ``That
comes from the hours I spent doing his copying. I absorbed
different things and didn't realize it. I've been going through the
music for the Smithsonian (which has the Duke Ellington archives)
and I understand it better now than I did then.
   ``For instance, I was going through the numbers he wrote for
`Jump for Joy' _ `I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,' `Brown-Skinned
Gal in the Calico Gown,' `Chocolate Shake.' I saw the entr'acte,
`Giddy Bug Gallop.' I realized this was something too amazing even
to hope to understand when I first heard it. Now I know what it is.
We (the band) are getting ready to do it ourselves.''
   ``Jump for Joy'' played to sold-out houses in Los Angeles in
1941 but never moved to Broadway. ``In certain quarters it wasn't
too popular,'' Mercer said. ``It was blatantly against racial
prejudice. There were threats to bomb the theater.''
   ``Queenie Pie,'' an opera Ellington composed for television but
was never broadcast, has been produced in Philadelphia and
Washington and is slated for Broadway next fall starring Patti
LaBelle. ``Queenie Pie Reggae,'' including steel drums, is on the
new album.
   Duke wrote the reggae. ``He didn't jump into a fad but he always
touched on it,'' Mercer said. ``He'd make sure he wasn't left out,
not having a say about what was happening. `Black Swan' was a
disguised form of `Take the A Train' as a cha-cha. He took `Creole
Love Call' and made it rock 'n' roll and called it `Neo-Creole.' He
wrote `Octaclock Rock,' after Harold Ashby got in the band.''
   From his first hit in 1930, ``Mood Indigo,'' Duke Ellington
wrote and composed thousands of works including popular songs,
suites, tone poems and three song cycles meant to be sung as sacred
concerts.
   ``The sacred concerts were sincere,'' Mercer said. ``It was also
another way for him to really be intelligent and get away with it.
Modern religious music is open enough to allow newer thoughts.
   ``He has done things with music which is not necessarily jazz.
As his friend Bob Bach (the late TV producer) said, `Duke is beyond
category.'''

<HEAD>The Vice Presidency According to Quayle</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The question is always more enticing than the
reply because there is only one right answer for a vice president.
And Dan Quayle gave it.
   ``No,'' Quayle said, he would not disclose the issues on which
he had differed with President Bush. ``Sorry.''
   Vice presidents who did otherwise have been sorrier. Spiro T.
Agnew came quickly to regret the misgivings he expressed about the
first gestures in what became President Richard M. Nixon's opening
to China. Hubert H. Humphrey had to back off his own effort to
chart an independent and slightly different Vietnam policy during
the 1968 presidential campaign.
   Harmony is the vice presidential rule, and the president picks
the tunes.
   ``I'm not going to get into private conversations that I have
with the president, what kind of influence and how I think I can
influence his decisions,'' Quayle told the American Society of
Newspaper Editors. ``It wouldn't be appropriate and I've decided
not to do it, and if I did engage in it I would lose my
effectiveness.
   ``So I'm just not going to enter into that kind of discussion.''
   That's right out of the vice presidential textbook according to
Bush, who kept his own counsel for eight years as No. 2 to Ronald
Reagan. He joined the ticket in 1980 as a defeated Reagan rival for
the presidential nomination. He was not a popular choice among many
of Reagan's conservative allies.
   So there was a premium on loyalty from the start, and Bush
delivered. It paid double dividends as Bush became Reagan's
political heir, and sometimes took shelter from potentially
embarrassing questions in the vows of privacy and silence he said
his job demanded.
   Quayle, by contrast, came to the Bush ticket as a rookie in
national politics, got a faltering start and still is working to
shake the lightweight image shaped by his detractors, not all of
whom are Democrats.
   That's no easy task in a job Nelson A. Rockefeller described as
``standby equipment.'' The prescribed duties are largely
ceremonial: Quayle jokes that Bush offered to designate him funeral
czar, since the vice president often gets the duty when foreign
leaders die.
   The president has done a lot more than that to help the vice
president prove himself. Bush has given Quayle a White House role
much like his own. He sent the vice president on the first foreign
assignment of the new administration, to Latin America, and Quayle
is about to begin a 10-day mission to Australia and Southeast Asia.
   They have shared platforms and sometimes audiences, in one-two
appearances that are unusual for presidents and vice presidents.
   Bush and Quayle both will address the members of The Associated
Press in separate appearances in Chicago on Monday. The president
is to speak at the AP annual meeting, the vice president two hours
later at the annual luncheon of the news cooperative.
   Both will answer questions, as they did two days apart at the
Washington meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Quayle heads a revitalized National Space Council, a vice
presidential assignment dating back to the time when John F.
Kennedy couldn't figure out what to do with Lyndon B. Johnson.
   He also will run a new Council on Competitiveness, which will
seek ways to improve the U.S. position in world trade.
   Perhaps most important, Bush has given Quayle a daily White
House role much like his own. ``I meet with the president every
morning,'' Quayle said. ``I have the right to go into his office
any time I want to. I can have a one-on-one meeting any time. I
have them periodically.
   ``I have a weekly scheduled luncheon where the president and I
sit down and have 60 minutes together to go over various things.
   ``What do we discuss? We discuss everything... I inject my
opinions, my ideas to him ... so it's not just one area that's
carved out for myself, there are various things.''
   Quayle said all of that is on the model of the Bush vice
presidency.
   ``Now, obviously, I'm a different individual than President Bush
and obviously in a period of time you will have the Quayle model of
the vice presidency,'' he said.
   ``We're just starting.''

   The Senate approved a record $157 billion
bailout and reform bill for the savings and loan industry after
toughening provisions that would require S&amp;L owners to put more of
their own money at risk to stay in business.
   The 564-page bill was approved Wednesday on a 91-8 vote two
months after President Bush called for emergency legislation to
stop the hemorrhaging of the federal S&amp;L insurance fund from the
failure of 500 thrifts, more than 200 of them in 1988, and another
350 at or near insolvency.
   The legislation would represent the biggest government financial
rescue in history, dwarfing by five times the combined costs of the
New York City, Penn Central, Chrysler and Lockheed bailouts of the
1970s and early 1980s.

   One of the biggest futures markets proposed
sweeping changes that would double surveillance and limit a
controversial trading practice in response to a federal fraud probe
that has tainted Chicago's financial industry.
   The most imporant restriction in a report Wednesday by the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Special Committee to Review Trading
Practices would be limits on dual trading, a controversial practice
that enables a trader to trade his own account at the same time he
handles customers' accounts.

   The Bush administration urged the Supreme
Court to protect the nation's children by upholding a federal law
that would shut down the $2 billion ``dial-a-porn'' industry.
   Congress was justified when it passed a law last year banning
all sexually explicit telephone dial-up message services to
``protect children from hearing patently offensive speech,''
Justice Department lawyer Richard Taranto contended Wednesday.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s decision to sell
its retail brokerage operation could save the firm the
embarrassment of losing its securities licenses in dozens of
states, a securities regulator says.
   In addition, Wall Street sources said Wednesday that Drexel is
requiring bidders for the brokerage to promise they won't hire any
of the unit's 1,100 brokers for one year if a bidder's deal falls
through.
   The move to abandon the retail brokerage, which has been part of
the firm for nearly all of its 157 years, followed Drexel's
settlement last week of civil fraud charges with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   Drexel has contacted securities officials in all 50 states to
prepare for a wave of litigation expected to follow the pact and
the firm's pending guilty plea and $650 million settlement of
felony charges with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.
   Most states bar securities trading by anyone convicted of or
admitting to a felony or facing an SEC injunction, said Susan
Bryant, who heads a panel of state regulators monitoring the Drexel
case. The states are expected to try to revoke Drexel's state
securities licenses.
   But Bryant said that by dumping its retail division, which has
43 offices in 19 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico,
Drexel may eliminate some state civil action to strip its trading
licenses.
   ``In most states the focus is on ... the need to protect the
consumer, so the negotiations with Drexel may actually change a
little bit,'' said Bryant, Oklahoma's securities administrator.
``The things that might have been required to protect the consumer
may not be necessary.''
   One firm said Wednesday it refused to join the bidding for the
brokerage operation because of the strict terms being applied by
Drexel, which announced the proposed sale Tuesday as part of a
major restructuring amid negative publicity following two major
securities fraud settlements.
   Drexel said it contacted about eight firms about buying the
division but three _ Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. _ said they're not interested.
   ``We declined because we questioned the appropriateness of this
auction process for a financial services company where clients and
professionals are the key assets,'' Dean Witter said in a statement.
   Drexel is forcing any firm that wants to examine the retail unit
to sign a letter stating it won't ``directly or indirectly solicit
the services'' of anyone in the division for one year, said a Wall
Street source who declined further identification.
   Firms that submit to the pact can review a package of
information provided by Drexel today and Friday and must submit a
bid by Saturday, the source said. Analysts have placed the value of
the department at $50 million to $200 million.
   The requirement is designed to block other firms from raiding
Drexel's 1,100 brokers _ many of whom vented their anger at Drexel
Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph during a session on the firm's
internal communications system after the announcement.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder denied that there was a one-year
moratorium on hiring Drexel brokers but refused to provide further
details on the agreements. He said four or five firms have agreed
to the bidding conditions.
   Officials at other firms said many Drexel brokers had contacted
them looking for jobs before the announcement, and several firms
were reported Wednesday to be negotiating with brokers.
   ``Putting them up on the auction block with no firm bidder
disclosed gives them great incentive to pursue their individual
fortunes,'' one Wall Street executive said. ``Probably as we speak
there's some very active cherry-picking going on.''
   Drexel's retail unit accounts for about 10 percent of the
private firm's business. At its peak, the department had 1,300
brokers, but Drexel didn't replace defectors or retirees because of
the October 1987 stock market crash and the government probes, a
Drexel spokesman said.
   Drexel said it also is abandoning its business in municipal
securities, over-the-counter stocks, and research and transactions
in foreign securities. The restructuring will cut Drexel's
9,100-member work force by about a third.
   A deal to buy the brokerage would include Drexel's retail
offices, stockbrokers and, presumably, the accounts that go with
them. Drexel has not said whether it will lay off the 1,200-member
support staff in the unit.

   A legal tactic Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. used
to battle civil securities fraud charges last year has come back to
haunt the investment giant and delay final settlement of the case.
   On Wednesday, a federal appeals court refused to modify a stay _
originally requested by Drexel _ that temporarily bars lower court
approval of the deal to settle the biggest securities fraud case in
history.
   The unanimous, three-judge appeals panel ruling prevents U.S.
District Judge Milton Pollack, whom Drexel unsuccessfully tried to
disqualify, from approving last week's settlement between Drexel
and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling also cast a shadow
over a final resolution of criminal charges against Drexel, the
fifth-largest investment firm in the nation.
   The plea bargain Drexel struck last December with federal
prosecutors in the criminal case, requiring the firm to plead
guilty to six felony counts and pay a record $650 million in
penalties and fines, is contingent on the SEC settlement.
   In Washington, SEC Solicitor Paul Gonson said, ``We are
disappointed with the Court of Appeals declining to permit the
(lower) court to enter this consent decree, which we feel is in the
public interest.''
   Gonson, who oversees SEC appeals, said the commission has
``decided to take further judicial action'' possibly as soon as
today, although he declined to give details.
   Deborah Corley, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Benito Romano,
said the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office would have no
comment on the ruling.
   Sources close to the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said it was unclear whether the 2nd Circuit decision prohibited the
SEC and Drexel from seeking a different district judge's approval.
If it did bar such an alternative, final approval of the settlement
could be delayed for months, they said.
   The SEC's sweeping civil action last September accused Drexel,
its former junk bond chief, Michael Milken, his brother, Lowell,
and others of insider trading and other securities violations.
   But Drexel battled to get Pollack to excuse himself from the
case for an alleged conflict of interest.
   Drexel lawyers maintained that Pollack should be disqualified
because his wife stood to make millions from a leveraged buyout
that Drexel had helped to finance.
   Pollack refused to step down from the case and the 2nd Circuit,
which stayed further district court proceedings pending its
decision, upheld Pollack in November.
   Drexel eventually gave up its objections to Pollack but the stay
was extended when the Milkens and other defendants sought to argue
the issue before the U.S. Sumpreme Court.
   The Supreme Court has not decided whether it will hear the
appeal.
   Last week, Drexel and the SEC moved to modify the stay, to allow
Pollack to rule on the settlement, claiming it was ``in the public
interest and important to the protection of investors'' for the
deal to go into effect.
   Gary Lynch, the SEC's director of enforcement, said the Drexel
deal was ``one of the most important'' cases ever brought and to
delay its implementation would delay payment of $350 million into a
fund to compensate investors hurt by Drexel's illegal activities.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird made it even plainer to the
2nd Circuit, saying additional delay could cause the five-year
statute of limitations ``to bar prosecutions'' stemming from the
Drexel probe.
   But the 2nd Circuit said allowing Pollack ``to consider and
possibly to approve this settlement would be to allow a change in
the status quo as it concerns the interests of Michael and Lowell
Milken before the Supreme Court has disposed of the case.''
   As part of its settlements with both the SEC and the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan, Drexel is required to fire Michael
Milken and suspend his brother, and not engage in business
transactions with either man.
   The Milkens, who were not part of either settlement, were named
earlier this month in a massive federal racketeering indictment
seeking more than $1.8 billion in forfeitures. The Milkens have
pleaded innocent.

<HEAD>Merc Proposes To Ban Most `Dual Trading,' Improve Surveillance, Auditing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed ban on most forms of ``dual trading,''
extensive background checks of new members and expansion of
disciplinary committees are proof that the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange wants to preserve integrity, officials said.
   ``We said there would be no sacred cows, and there were none,''
said Susan Phillips, former chairman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and a member of the Merc's Special Committee to
Review Trading Practices.
   Committee Chairman John Geldermann said the urgency of
Wednesday's recommendations was necessary to maintain investor
confidence since disclosure three months ago of a federal
investigation into suspected fraud at the Merc and the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Dual trading, allowed by virtually every financial exchange,
enables a trader to trade his own account at the same time he
handles customers' accounts.
   Many consider the practice susceptible to abuse because it
allows unscrupulous traders to allocate profitable deals to their
own accounts and dump losing trades on customers.
   Proponents of dual trading argue that the practice increases
liquidity because traders can continue doing business when they
don't have outside orders.
   But the Merc committee, with few exceptions, recommended that
dual trading be banned from futures contracts in cases where market
volume is great enough to ensure liquidity.
   The committee also recommended:
   _More extensive screening of membership applicants.
   _That members of a broker association should not be allowed to
execute personal trades against orders by members of the broker
group.
   _The addition of one non-Merc member to all major disciplinary
committees. ``The criticism is that we're too clubby,'' said Merc
policy chief Leo Melamed. ``This would enable the public to view
the process and see we are open-handed.''
   _Daily computerized trade information for members covering all
activity from the previous day.
   The panel also recommended the Merc's full-time floor
surveillance team be doubled to eight staff members.
   The recommendations will be submitted to the Merc's board of
governors, and a decision is expected within 60 days.
   ``The outside members of the committee felt that the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange has acted in good faith in enforcing its
existing rules and procedures, and tightening them when
necessary,'' said Ms. Phillips, a vice president at the University
of Iowa.
   ``But the rules and procedures have not kept pace with the rapid
expansion of new products and trading volume during the past few
years,'' she said.
   Melamed said many of the recommendations contained in the report
were under consideration earlier.
   ``But the time frame was compressed as a result of the (federal)
investigation,'' he said.
   Merc officials appointed the nine-member committee in late
January.
   Some observers viewed the committee as part of the futures
industry's effort to hold the line against further government
regulations.
   The FBI investigation centers on allegations that as many as 100
brokers at the world's two largest futures exchanges may have
systematically cheated investors out of millions of dollars through
illegal trading practices.
   No indictments have been handed down yet, but as many as 200
subpeonas reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the
exchanges. Published reports have said FBI agents posing as traders
at the Merc and Board of Trade secretly recorded conversations in
the pits.

   GTE Corp. and the Home Shopping Network
have exchanged another round of barbs as they prepare for a court
battle over a $1.5 billion damages lawsuit.
   On Wednesday, the day GTE held its annual meeting, the Home
Shopping Network announced that it had filed a complaint on April
10 against the telephone giant with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The letter accused GTE of failing to fully disclose the
potential threat it faces from the $1.5 billion lawsuit filed
against it by HSN.
   GTE vice president Edward C. Schmults issued a release at the
annual meeting that labeled the complaint as ``totally unfounded.''
   Home Shopping's lawsuit in Florida state court contends GTE had
provided it poor telephone equipment. As a result, HSN claims it
lost thousands of customers. In addition, the lawsuit claims GTE
knew its equipment was inadequate and fraudulently kept the
information secret from HSN.
   Home Shopping Network is distributed nationally on cable
networks. It offers merchandise for sale, which viewers can
purchase by calling telephone numbers displayed on television
screens.
   GTE has denied any wrongdoing in its past dealings with HSN. It
also has filed a countersuit, charging HSN with business libel and
slander.
   Responding to HSN's latest claim, Schmults said, ``It is obvious
that this latest HSN action is just another unconscionable example
of HSN's attempting to litigate the case outside the courtroom and
unfairly influence prospective jurors.''
   A trial is expected to start on June 5 at a court in Clearwater,
Fla., where HSN is based.
   In the lawsuit, HSN is seeking $500 million in actual damages
and $1 billion in punitive damages.
   Fernando DiFilippo, HSN general counsel, dismissed Schmults
comments as ``GTE's standard public relations response.''
   ``Instead of responding that our allegations are unfounded, they
ought to go back and review them,'' he said.
   The battle of words on the lawsuit overshadowed other business
at GTE's annual meeting. The gathering was the first to be presided
over by James L. Johnson, who was named chairman and chief
executive officer one year ago.
   ``As most of you are aware, the financial results were excellent
for us,'' Johnson said of 1988. ``We made further progress in the
continuing the efforts to enhance our long term profits.''
   The company reported a record income of $1.2 billion in 1988,
9.5 percent higher than 1987. The company also had record revenues
of $16.5 billion, 6.7 percent higher than the $15.4 billion logged
in 1987.
   On Tuesday, the company reported a first-quarter income of $329
million on sales totaling $4.1 billion. Earnings and revenue both
were up 15 percent compared to the 1988 figures.
   In response to a shareholder question, Johnson defended GTE's
decision last July to sell a 30.1 percent interest in US Sprint to
United Telecommunications Inc. for $585 million. US Sprint is a
long-distance telephone service formed in 1986 by GTE and United
Telecommunications.
   ``It was a win-win situation. They won, we won. We think it was
a good decision,'' Johnson said.
   GTE, which still holds a 19.9 percent share of US Sprint, lost
$1.5 billion in developing the network, said Charles R. Lee,
president and chief operating officer. GTE intends to eventually
sell the rest of its Sprint ownership, he said.
   GTE, based in Stamford, provides telephone service to 31 states,
Canada and the Dominican Republic. GTE also is a major military
telephone contractor, ringing up more than $2 billion worth of
Defense Department contracts in 1988.

<HEAD>Pennwalt Earnings Up 12 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennwalt Corp., which agreed to a friendly
takeover a month ago to escape hostile pursuers, announced a 12
percent increase in first-quarter earnings.
   The pharmaceutical company on Wednesday reported earnings of
$46.3 million, or $3.54 a share, on revenue of $279.9 million,
compared with earnings of $41.2 million, or $1.08 a share, on
revenue of $264.4 million a year ago.
   The quarter's per-share earnings included $1.21 from the sale of
Pennwalt Italia SpA, a chemical operation sold last month.
   Pennwalt has streamlined in the past year while trying to hold
off Centaur Partners, a New York investment firm. A month ago,
Pennwalt and the French oil and chemical company El Aquitane agreed
to a takeover worth more than $1 billion.
   Sales in the industrial and intermediate chemicals group
increased 13 percent and earnings increased 30 percent, the company
said.
   ``All three of the major divisions making up this group _
fluorochemicals, inorganic chemicals and organic chemicals _
contributed to these outstanding results,'' said Edwin E. Tuttle,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   The earnings report came one day after Elf Aquitane announced it
had extended its tender offer of $132 per share for three weeks,
unitl May 19. The company said it needed the additional time to
comply with the Federal Trade Commission's request for information
and documents involving the proposed takeover.

<HEAD>Hasbro Announces Agreement To Buy Most Of Coleco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AVON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc. says it favors its own
reorganization plan despite Hasbro Inc.'s announcement of an
agreement with a group of Coleco's unsecured creditors to seek to
acquire most of the financially troubled toymaker.
   Hasbro said Wednesday it would seek permission from a federal
bankruptcy court judge to file a joint reorganization plan for
Avon-based Coleco, which earlier this month announced an amended
reorganization plan it hoped would satisfy its unsecured creditors.
   In a statement Wednesday, Coleco said the Hasbro proposal
``appears to be less favorable'' than the amended reorganization
plan Coleco proposed April 6.
   Under Hasbro's proposal, the Rhode Island-based toymaker would
purchase Coleco's assets by giving Coleco $85 million in cash and a
warrant worth an estimated $5 million to acquire 1 million shares
of Hasbro's stock over the next four years, said John T. O'Neill,
Hasbro's chief financial officer. A warrant offers the right to buy
stock at a certain price.
   O'Neill said Hasbro is looking to acquire property rights and
some of Coleco's inventory but that the final determination of what
Hasbro will assume would be detailed in the reorganization plan.
   Coleco said it has been developing the amended plan with ``a
substantial group'' of unsecured creditors for several weeks and
that Coleco management believes it ``will be of greater benefit to
all creditors and shareholders than the Hasbro proposal.''
   On April 6, Coleco said that under the amended plan, unsecured
creditors, who are owed more than $400 million, would receive stock
in the company, giving them about 37 percent of Coleco.
   Coleco Chairman Morton E. Handel also said at the time that the
unsecured creditors would receive other securities, cash, notes and
debt instruments worth about $40 million. The amendment also called
for secured creditors to convert their current claim of about $80
million into Coleco common stock, giving them 60 percent ownership.
   The Coleco board of directors called that plan ``a substantial
improvement for the unsecured creditors'' over a plan filed in
January, which unsecured creditors said did not offer them enough.
   Once one of the nation's largest toymakers, Coleco filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws in July 1988 and in February announced it was
considering selling the company.
   At the same time as it announced its amended reorganization
plan, Coleco said it had dropped plans of a sale. It reaffirmed
Wednesday that it wants to remain independent.
   Barry J. Alperin, an executive vice president at Hasbro, said
Hasbro indicated its interest in buying Coleco when Coleco
announced it was exploring a sale.
   ``We were disappointed that Coleco failed to follow that course
of action, but are pleased to be working with the unsecured
creditors committee to seek the permission of the bankruptcy court
to acquire the company,'' Alperin said.
   O'Neill said a petition asking the bankruptcy court for
permission to file a joint reorganization plan would probably be
filed Thursday. If it is accepted, Hasbro officials hope to
complete the acquisition by the end of July, he said.

<TEXT>
   Takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens, now the
largest shareholder in a major Japanese auto parts maker, failed
Thursday in his bid for an immediate seat on its board, the company
president said.
   In a meeting with president Takao Matsuura and other officers of
Koito Manufacturing Co., Pickens outlined his desire to participate
in the management of the company and requested a seat on the board,
but company officials declined to give him an immediate answer,
Matsuura told reporters.
   ``It is necessary to build a trusting relationship first. In
Japan, it is not possible to just say, `I'm a major shareholder'
and get a seat on the board right away,'' said Koito director
Tamotsu Aoyama.
   Koito officials are discussing whether to offer Pickens a board
seat.
   ``We don't necessarily understand his interest in managing our
company,'' Aoyama said. ``Mr. Pickens is known for his
qualifications in the oil business and in corporate buyouts, not in
manufacturing.''
   In a speech in Tokyo Wednesday, Pickens argued that companies
should be responsible first to their shareholders and only
secondarily to their management and employees _ an idea that flies
in the face of Japanese business culture.
   Pickens holds a 20.2 percent stake in Koito, which makes
headlights and other parts for Toyota Motor Co. Toyota owns 19.1
percent of the company.
   Pickens also has denied he is interested in greenmail, the
practice of seeking profits by buying up a company's shares until a
friendly shareholder steps in to buy them back at a premium.
   Koito and Toyota, its previous largest shareholder, had been the
victim of greenmail attempts by Azabu Motor, the auto retailer and
investment company from which Pickens bought his Koito stake,
analysts said.
   Pickens assured Koito's managment that he intended to be a
long-term shareholder and was not merely speculating, company
officials said.
   Matsuura said Pickens was welcome to buy more shares if he
intends to be a ``stable shareholder'' _ which in Japan means one
interested primarily in maintaining a business relationship rather
than reaping dividends or capital gains and who doesn't sell even
when the share price drops.

   Conrail reported a 25 percent increase in
first-quarter income, citing an increase in rates and an
improvement in the railroad's mix of freight.
   The railroad earned $60 million, or 88 cents a share, on revenue
of $872 million, compared with $48 million, or 69 cents a share, on
$831 million a year earlier.
   ``We are pleased with Conrail's first-quarter financial
performance,'' Stanley E.G. Hillman, Conrail's acting chairman,
president and chief executive officer, said Wednesday.
   ``An improving traffic mix and moderately higher freight rates
were the key reasons for the significantly high income,'' he said.
   Traffic was up in automotive parts and new vehicles, 14.6
percent; coal, 5.6 percent; intermodal, up 2.2 percent; and food
and grain, up 1.3 percent.
   Traffic dropped in forest products, down 8.2 percent; metals and
related products, down 4.3 percent; and chemicals and related
products, down 1.3 percent.
   James A. Hagen had been selected Conrail's new chairman,
president and chief executive officer. Hagen will assume his new
post May 18.

   The stock market was mixed today, struggling to
extend its recent rally amid a spate of strong first-quarter
earnings reports.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.20 to 2,384.71
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 539 up, 390 down and
559 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.53 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Digital Equipment was a standout performer, climbing 3\ to 102\.
The company reported earnings for the fiscal quarter ended April 1
of $2.05 a share. That was down from $2.33 a share in the
comparable period a year earlier, but still better than most
analysts had expected.
   Companies impressing investors with quarterly earnings gains
this week have included giants like American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
and Philip Morris.
   In today's trading, Philip Morris rose \ to 125] and AT&amp;T was
unchanged at 33{.
   The strong trend in profits has been regarded as particularly
encouraging because many analysts believe the economy has been
slowing since early in the first quarter of the year.
   Nevertheless, brokers said some traders were cashing in on the
market's recent gains with stocks at their highest level in more
than 18 months.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .06 to 171.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .32 at 340.75.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.51 to
2,386.91, bringing its gain over the past four sessions to 90.91
points.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by a modest margin on the
NYSE.
   Big Board volume totaled 191.51 million shares, against 208.65
million in the previous session.

   Oil futures prices hit a three-year high as
traders reacted to news that could spell trouble for the energy
industry, including a North Sea gas explosion and an industry
report that showed U.S. crude production fell to its lowest level
since the 1960s.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May price of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, jumped $1.10 to
$22.61 a barrel Wednesday, the highest level since Jan. 17, 1986,
when the near-term contract finished at $23.53 a barrel.
   Prices continued higher in early trading today, with the
contract for May delivery up 29 cents to $22.90 a barrel.
   The explosion on a small gas platform Tuesday forced the
shutdown of a major oil pipeline carrying 472,000 barrels a day of
Brent crude mostly to European cities. Officials of Shell U.K.
Exploration and Production did not say when normal operations would
resume. The platform is a main gathering point for Brent crude
coming from major oil fields in the North Sea.
   Meanwhile, a leak in a pumping station 25 miles southeast of
Fairbanks, Alaska, forced a reduction in oil flow through the
Alaska pipeline. Oil was cut by 25 percent to 1.5 million barrels,
but was expected to return to full operation shortly, officials
said.
   Energy brokers said the timing of the events, following the
Alaskan oil spill last month and other recent production problems
in the North Sea and elsewhere, exacerbated the impact on oil
prices.
   ``The reason we're seeing oil prices going up is because of
these accidents,'' said C. Hossein Tahmassebi, chief economist for
Ashland Oil Inc. ``Without them, the market situation would be
considerably different.''
   In the last six months oil prices have risen more than $10 a
barrel, or nearly 80 percent. Last Oct. 5, crude prices dipped to
$12.60 a barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange Wednesday, the May
contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.76 cent to 74.62 cents a
gallon, while heating oil for May delivery increased 0.57 cent to
53.33 cents a gallon.
   The American Petroleum Institute, meanwhile, released its
monthly report showing that domestic production in March totaled
7.65 million barrels a day, down 8.2 percent, or 690,000 barrels
per day, from the year-ago level.
   U.S. production had not been that low since 1964, when it
averaged 7.614 million barrels a day, said Ron Planting, an API
senior analyst in Washington.
   The API, which represents major oil producers and refiners,
attributed the drop to the March 24 Alaskan oil spill and to
declining production in other major U.S. oilfields. The spill last
month temporarily shut down critical oil shipping lanes into the
lower United States.
   ``Although the unusually large decline reflected in part
developments related to the tanker grounding near Valdez, almost
300,000 barrels per day of the 690,000 barrel-a-day decrease was
accounted for by falling production in the lower 48, a decline that
has continued now for three years,'' the API report said.
   Planting noted that while problems in Alaska oil fields are
temporary, ``what's happening in the lower 48 is not.''
   Analysts said that despite the recent rise in crude prices, it
will take time for the United States to increase production. And
the Alaskan spill will delay congressional permission for major oil
companies to begin drilling in the protected Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, which is believed to hold huge reserves of oil and
natural gas.
   Tahmassebi said many in and out of the industry are questioning
the reason for the North Sea accidents.
   ``Is this happening because of low oil prices and companies
cutting back on maintenance to keep up profitability?'' he said.
``If so, these types of things will continue happening.''
   Analysts said the market also got a boost from a weekly API
report released after the close of trading Tuesday that showed
crude oil stocks fell by 5.7 million barrels last week.
   Jim Steel, an energy analyst with Refco Inc., said the report
reflected growing seasonal demand for oil and oil products as the
spring-summer driving season gets under way. He said that over the
next few weeks, gasoline prices could continue to drive crude
futures higher.
   ``Gasoline has been so strong out of proportion to crude that
players can buy crude and turn it into gasoline at a good profit,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   It's the only completely computerized U.S.
securities market and the only one that didn't get overwhelmed
during the October 1987 crash, while rivals in New York, Chicago,
Philadelphia and elsewhere foundered.
   But the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, a high-tech office couched in
the century-old Dixie Terminal Building overlooking the Ohio River,
remains relatively obscure and unknown to the broad investing
public. It's an identity problem that angers and frustrates the
exchange's president.
   ``It's time New York and the others recognized the time has
come,'' said Richard B. Niehoff, a third generation stockbroker who
left the family business, Weil Roth &amp; Irving, in 1979 to head the
Cincinnati market.
   Cincinnati was a small regional market handling mostly local
stocks and over-the-counter offerings until 1976 when the governors
voted to automate. They have updated and expanded several times,
the last in 1985.
   ``I saw back in the 1970s that this was where the market was
going. We had a membership here and New York and Philadelphia and I
could see this just wasn't going to keep on working,'' Niehoff said.
   ``I figured it would take about half a generation, about 10
years, when people would start feeling comfortable about punching
into a computer and that's about what it is taking,'' he said.
   Cincinnati has teamed up with the Chicago Board Options Exchange
and Reuters Holdings PLC to link the two exchanges with thousands
of computers around the world for trading 24 hours a day.
   The system is not expected to be operating until 1990. It will
need approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile,
the trading hours will remain 9:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. Eastern time.
   The prospect of Cincinnati emerging as a key link to a world
trading market with immediate access to European and Asian
exchanges seems incongruous for this river city, known primarily to
outsiders as the home of Pete Rose's red-legged baseball team and
soap giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
   The exchange itself is a second-floor office staffed by 20
people, more than half of them hunched over computer terminal
screens in a silent, high-tech trading room, watching the automated
execution of orders placed electronically by buyers and sellers
nationwide. The staffers are watching for any unusual stock
activity that might indicate insider trading or other abuses.
   Niehoff said Cincinnati can handle up to 45 stock transactions
per second, far faster than the shouted orders and signals on Wall
Street.
   He noted that while the big exchanges have partly automated,
they still require personal contact between buyer and seller,
slowing everything.
   ``The big brokers like Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber and others
have already set up their own automated systems and have bigger
trading rooms than New York. If you put them all together they'd
make the New York Stock Exchange look like a second rate
ballroom,'' said Niehoff.

   Much of the U.S. cotton business still is
handled by Memphis merchants, but the days are past when buyers and
sellers packed into the downtown Cotton Exchange to haggle over
prices or trade gossip.
   The big chalkboard, 50 feet long and 10 feet high, still
dominates one wall of the ``trading room,'' a high-ceilinged
flashback of brass fans and gracefully arched windows.
   But the real trading information comes by computer now, and most
of the exchange's 98 members have their own.
   ``They don't necessarily need to come to the floor now,'' said
Reta J. Martin, secretary of the exchange. ``It's just a
convenience for them to come in here and visit and talk.'
   The Cotton Exchange building, a 12-story, blond stone affair at
the corner of Front Street and Union Avenue in downtown Memphis,
was built in 1924 and is on the National Register of Historic
Places.
   The exchange itself was formed in 1873, and though the mechanics
of trading have changed, it still serves its original purpose of
organizing the city's cotton business.
   ``If a guy says I'll give you 61 cents a pound for your cotton
based on Memphis Cotton Exchange rules, everybody knows what you're
talking about,'' said W. Neely Mallory Jr., president of the
exchange. ``It sets a standard of rules by which cotton is traded.
It also tries to assure the fair treatment of one merchant with
another.''
   Exchange membership has dropped from 175 to 98 over the years,
largely because of bigger firms absorbing smaller ones, Ms. Martin
said.
   The business in Memphis is ``spot cotton,'' or cotton for
immediate delivery, though many members of the exchange deal in
futures trading too. A TV monitor mounted in a wall below the big
board carries figures from the Chicago futures market.
   Ron Cole, chief of the market news branch of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture in Memphis, said it's hard to get solid figures on
how much business the city's cotton merchants conduct, though they
obviously handle the majority of domestic spot sales.
   ``These firms are not willing to tell the government or anyone
else how much business they do,'' Cole said.
   The USDA keeps up with cotton production, he said, but a crop
can be bought and sold many times.
   Jess Barr, an economist with the National Cotton Council, said
all but two or three of the nation's largest cotton dealers are
members of the Memphis exchange.
   Bill Day, an exchange member for 40 years, estimated that 75
percent of the domestic spot cotton market is handled by Memphis
companies.
   ``This is my office,'' Day said, on one of his daily visits to
the trading room. ``I've got an office next door but I only go
there to pick up the mail.''
   Day, who describes himself as semi-retired, said the Memphis
exchange included a trading pit for cotton seed and soybean futures
in the 1950s, and two dozen representatives of Chicago futures
brokers worked the floor in the 1960s.
   The trading room still has a bank of telephone booths and a
dozen small windows once staffed by Western Union operators.
   Though some of the bigger companies are now in suburban business
centers, many exchange members still operate on Front Street, the
city's ``Cotton Row'' where bags of cotton samples called snakes
often are piled along the sidewalks.
   Robert Gardner, whose family company Gardner &amp; Son Inc. is on
Cotton Row, said smaller firms still rely on the exchange for
market information.
   ``I can come in here and find out some prices and what's been
selling recently, who might be buying and who might be selling,' he
said. ``But when you're an international grain company, you don't
need to come down here.''
   The trading room generally draws a dozen or so visitors for
brief visits each day, Ms. Martin said.
   In its heyday though, it drew packed crowds to watch the three
``walkers'' who manned the brass-railed walkway of the big board,
updating market figures from New York, Chicago and New Orleans as
well as Memphis.
   The exchange building too has changed from when it primarily
housed merchants, shippers and others in the cotton business. The
building was sold in 1983 to Memphis real estate developer Henry
Turley who refurbished it with an emphasis on brass, etched glass
and stone. It now houses a range of business offices, through the
exchange still holds the bottom floor.

<HEAD>Net Income Up Sharply In First Quarter, But Extraordinary Losses
Blamed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textron Inc. reported first-quarter
earnings Thursday that were about 64 percent higher than those of
the previous year, when two extraordinary expenses held the
company's performance down.
   For the three months ended April 1, 1989, Textron's net income
was $63.3 million, or 73 cents per share, compared with $38.7
million, or 43 cents per share, during the comparable 1988 period.
   The company's first-quarter 1988 income before the extraordinary
losses was $68.4 million or 76 cents per share. The extraordinary
losses were caused by an arbitrator's $20 million award against a
subsidiary and some early debt retirement.
   B.F. Dolan, chairman of the Providence-based conglomerate, said
increased shipments and profits at Textron's Bell Helicopter
subsidiary were offset by increased costs on other programs and the
completion last year of a military contract for aircraft wings.
   Earnings from Avdel PLC, a British fastening systems
manufacturing business that Textron bought in early 1989, were not
included in the report because the Federal Trade Commission has
ordered Textron not to exercise control over the company until it
considers the antitrust ramifications of the deal.
   Textron did list a $3.9 million interest expense stemming from
its acquisition of Avdel.

   Stock prices fell today as a weak dollar and
rising interest rates blunted the market's recent rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 90.91
points over the past four sessions, tumbled 23.46 to 2,363.45 by 11
a.m.. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 340 up, 876
down and 516 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 69.86 million shares at
midmorning.
   Prices rose at the outset, but abruptly reversed course after
West Germany's central bank announced increases in its official
interest rates.
   The dollar fell in foreign exchange, and U.S. open-market
interest rates headed higher.
   Analysts cited fears that the Bundesbank's action would require
higher interest rates in this country to enable the dollar to hold
its ground against leading foreign currencies.
   In addition, brokers said some traders were eager to cash in on
the market's recent gains with stocks at their highest level in
more than 18 months.
   Digital Equipment bucked the downtrend, climbing 1| to 100|. The
company reported earnings for the fiscal quarter ended April 1 of
$2.05 a share. That was down from $2.33 a share in the comparable
period a year earlier, but still better than most analysts had
expected.
   Navistar led the active list, down { at 5{. The company said it
has reduced its internal earnings forecasts for the current quarter
and the full fiscal year that ends Oct. 31.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.18 to 170.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .63 at 339.80.

   Caterpillar Inc., a major manufacturer of
earth-moving equipment, Thursday said its first-quarter income rose
19.5 percent, reflecting higher domestic and international sales.
   The company said after-tax earnings came to $141 million, or
$1.39 a share, up from $118 million, or $1.16 a share, a year
earlier.
   Sales were $2.63 billion, an increase of $280 million, or 12
percent, over $2.35 billion in the corresponding 1988 quarter.
   Stronger demand and some rebuilding of dealer inventories were
responsible for the higher volume, the company said.
   ``Dealer sales increased significantly in most industrial
countries,'' the company said in a prepared announcement.
``Interest rates were relatively stable, and business profits
remained high. As a result, machine owners increased replacement
purchases,'' Caterpillar stated.
   ``In the developing countries, higher commodity prices resulted
in improved demand for Caterpillar products. In addition,
construction activity rebounded in some developing countries,
primarily in the Far East,'' Caterpillar said.
   Caterpillar's worldwide employment at the end of the first
quarter totaled 61,052 people, an increase of 494 from the end of
1988.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Mixed On Weather Uncertainty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting a mixed bag of weather forecasts for key U.S.
crop-growing areas.
   Corn and wheat futures were slightly lower while soybeans and
oats were mostly higher.
   The National Weather Service issued a six-to-10-day forecast
late Wednesday that predicted above-normal rainfall next week in
the corn-and-soybean country of the western Midwest and the
winter-wheat fields of the central Great Plains, two areas where
drought conditions have persisted for nearly a year.
   But many private forecasters still foresee very little
precipitation for the western Corn Belt, where farmers are just
beginning their spring planting.
   A 10-day-old dockworkers' strike in Brazil, the world's
second-largest soybean producer, is increasingly supportive for the
soybean market. But weather ``is the single biggest influence
overall,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.10{ a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 1\ cents lower with May at $2.73 a bushel; oats were } cent to
1\ cents higher with May at $1.97} a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent
lower to 1} cents higher with May at $7.46} a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .43 cent higher with June at 70.75
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with
May at 75.75 cents a pound; hogs were .28 cent lower to .30 cent
higher with June at 45.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.02 cent lower to .13 cent higher with May at 31.70 cents a pound.

<UNK>RJR Earnings Tumble In Wake Of Takeover, Smokeless Cigarette Failure</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. today reported its first-quarter
income tumbled 62 percent because of costs associated with its
takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. and the failure of its
smokeless cigarette.
   The Atlanta-based consumer products company said its after-tax
earnings amounted to $103 million, down from $273 million a year
earlier. Earnings per share were 44 cents vs. $1.09 in the first
quarter of 1988.
   Sales in this year's first quarter totaled $4 billion, up 5
percent from $3.8 billion in 1988.
   Also today, company officials refused comment on a Wall Street
Journal article saying RJR Nabisco might soon announce plans to
move its corporate headquarters to New York from Atlanta.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified former RJR executive as
saying the relocation announcement might be made at the company's
annual meeting next Thursday.
   RJR Nabisco moved its headquarters to Atlanta two years ago from
Winston-Salem, N.C., its home for more than a century. There had
been talk of a move back to North Carolina since the KKR takeover,
but the Journal quoted senior executives close to the company as
saying RJR's new chairman and chief executive officer, Louis
Gerstner Jr., wants to work in New York.
   Gerstner, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., was president of
American Express Co. before his move to RJR Nabisco.
   New York-based KKR succeeded in its $24.53 billion takeover of
RJR Nabisco in February, and RJR said its first quarter results
were reduced by $247 million because of ``change of control'' costs
associated with the merger.
   Other merger-related costs will be reflected in earnings once
the merger is completed, the company said. A special stockholders'
meeting to formally approve the merger is scheduled for April 27.
   Test marketing of the smokeless Premier cigarette also was
discontinued in February, and RJR Nabisco said the failure resulted
in a $55 million charge against earnings in the first quarter.
   The company's R.J. Reynolds Tobacco subsidiary also has
announced that 700 employees will be offered early retirement or
cash incentives to leave their jobs as a result of Premier's
failure.
   Without the merger-related costs and the charge for the
discontinued Premier test, earnings per share would have been $1.41
and net income would have been $320 million in the first quarter,
RJR Nabisco said.
   Gerstner said he saw a solid performance in the quarter that
``demonstrates the basic strength of our tobacco and food
businesses and provides a foundation for continued progress.''

<HEAD>Shutdown Might Last A Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shutdown of the North Sea Brent oil field,
currently affecting nearly one-fifth of Britain's oil production,
might last a month, the government indicated Thursday.
   The news sent already-strong oil prices even higher. The spot
price for Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude
oil, rose to $21.40 a barrel in London Thursday afternoon, from
$21.05 late Wednesday.
   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson said in reponse to questions in
the House of Commons that two energy department inspectors were
still at Shell U.K. Exploration and Production's Cormorant Alpha
platfrom, where a gas leak and explosion on Tuesday halted Brent
oil field production.
   There were no injuries, said the operator, a unit of the Royal
Dutch-Shell Group of Companies.
   The Cormorant Alpha platform lies about 100 miles northeast of
Lerwick in Shetland.
   The Cabinet minister, who said he had spoken to the inspectors
an hour previously, said he couldn't say when the system would
reopen ``until they've completed their assessment.'' He added that
he couldn't estimate how long that assessment would take.
   But the minister suggested in further comments that the
Cormorant platform wouldn't be reopened for three to four weeks.
   ``Reports of this time closure have been widely mentioned,'' the
minister said.
   Parkinson said that the closure of the Cormorant Alpha platform
and other platforms in the Brent field which routed their crude
through Cormorant to the Sullom Voe terminal has taken about
400,000 barrels a day, or 17 percent of total North Sea production,
out of the market.
   Other closures in the North Sea already have curtailed
production.
   He said there hadn't been any structural damage to Cormorant
Alpha.
   Shell has said that engineers might be able to divert Brent
field production so that it bypasses Cormorant Alpha.
   Parkinson said, ``Our best estimate of the effect, assuming a
four-to-six weeks' closure, is 800 million pounds ($1.4 billion) on
the current account this year.''
   Britain, a big oil exporter, produces an average 2 million
barrels a day.
   Parkinson said his director of safety inspection wouldn't allow
the Brent production and transportation system reopened until all
safety precautions were taken.
   A fire on the Occidental Petroleum Corp.-operated Piper Alpha
platform in the North Sea last summer killed 167 men.

<HEAD>GM 1st Quarter Earnings Up</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: AMs version planned.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. on Thursday reported that
continuing strong performance overseas helped push first-quarter
earnings up 42.2 percent over last year, when the company realized
benefits from a one-time accounting change.
   The nation's largest corporation said it earned $1.55 billion,
or $2.37 a share, during the January-March period this year,
compared with $1.09 billion, or $1.56 a share, during the same
period last year.
   GM sales during the first three months of this year, excluding
its vehicle-financing arm and other financing operations, rose 11.9
percent to $29.6 billion from $26.44 billion during the same time
last year.
   Earnings and sales figures for last year reflect the accounting
change GM adopted Jan. 1, 1988. The per-share earnings figures for
both periods reflect a 2-for-1 stock split which was effective
March 31, 1989.
   GM said its overseas earnings during the first quarter this year
exceeded the record first-quarter amount earned last year. GM also
said its North American operations, which had been lagging
recently, contributed significantly to first-quarter profits.
   The company also said that during this year's first quarter, it
cut costs by about $1 billion. That brings to $9.5 billion the
company said it has cut in a program aimed at slashing $12.5
billion to $13 billion by the end of 1990.
   GM also said its sales to dealers were up 6.2 percent in the
first quarter compared with last year. But there has been
speculation that GM will have to trim production during the second
half of the year because of lower-than-expected first-quarter sales.
   At the end of March, GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. began
new incentive programs designed to shrink inventories while keeping
production levels up. The effects of the incentives, which normally
eat into profits, aren't clear yet.
   Ford is expected to issue its first-quarter earnings next week,

<HEAD>Earnings Up 6.6 Percent At Bell Atlantic, Up 3.8 Percent At U S West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Baby Bell phone companies reported higher first-quarter
earnings Thursday, up 6 percent at Bell Atlantic Corp. and 3.8
percent at U S West Inc.
   Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said earnings rose to $348.8
million, or $1.77 a share, from $329.1 million, or $1.66 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 5.3 percent to $2.77 billion from $2.63
billion a year earlier.
   The company was helped by record usage of its phone network.
   Denver-based U S West reported earnings of $249.6 million, or
$1.37 a share, for the quarter ending March 31, compared to $240.5
million, or $1.30 a share, during first-quarter 1988. Sales rose to
$2.39 billion for the quarter, compared to $2.19 billion during
that period last year.
   U S West attributed mainly to gains by the telephone company's
commercial real estate subsidiary, BetaWest Properties. The
quarter's figures reflect its sale of City Financial Tower in
Honolulu. Terms were not disclosed.

<HEAD>Union Calls for Strike Vote by Dockworkers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British dockworkers' union on Thursday
recommended that a strike vote be taken in protest against a plan
to abolish laws ensuring dockworkers lifelong job security.
   A strike by dockworkers would affect operations at 46 British
ports, which are estimated to handle about 70 percent of Britain's
foreign trade.
   Transport and General Workers Union Deputy General Secretary
Bill Morris said the union would ask the 9,400 dockworkers affected
by the plans to authorize a strike.
   The move follows the breakdown of talks Tuesday between the
union and the National Association of Port Employers over a
replacement for the 42-year-old Dock Labor Scheme.
   Morris said a committee of the union leadership and dockworkers
agreed a strike would be in order, reversing a decision on Friday
to refrain from striking pending negotiations with the employers'
group.
   The results of the strike ballot would be announced within three
weeks.
   Ron Todd, general secretary of the union, had said following
Tuesday's meeting with port employers that the two sides were
``poles apart'' on a replacement for the scheme.
   As many as a third of the workers covered by the dock labor laws
walked off their jobs April 7, a day after Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher announced her intention to submit a bill abolishing the
laws, which had been designed to protect workers against casual
labor.
   Critics of the scheme say it has led to abuses, including
dockworkers getting paid for not working.
   Mrs. Thatcher's bill, which includes compensation payments for
dockworkers who lose their jobs as a result, is expected to be
passed later this year.
   Employers are expected to take legal action against the union in
the event of a strike, claiming the action amounts to an illegal
protest against government policy rather than a dispute with
management.

<HEAD>Bank Acquires 6.6 Percent of Dunkin' Donuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Toronto-based investment bank has acquired 6.6
percent of Dunkin Donuts Inc. in a possible bid to gain control of
the doughnut chain, a bank official said today.
   Kingsbridge Capital Group, an affiliate of Unicorp Canada Corp.,
filed papers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Wednesday as required when companies acquire more than a 5 percent
position in another company, said Kingsbridge spokesman Eric Evans.
   The merchant bank also announced plans to continue buying stock
in Dunkin' Donuts, which is based in Randolph, Mass. Dunkin' Donuts
stock is traded over the counter.
   As of today, Kingsbridge has spent $13.4 million in buying
422,000 shares of Dunkin' Donuts, 6.6 percent of the shares
outstanding as of Feb. 28.
   A spokesman for Dunkin' Donuts did not immediately return a
telephone call seeking comment.
   In its SEC filing, Kingsbridge listed as its options, ``among
other possibilities, to purchase additional shares or dispose of
some or all of the shares then held, seek control of (Dunkin'
Donuts) through a tender offer, merger, recapitalization, proxy
contest or otherwise, or seek possible improvements in the
profitability and market value,'' of Dunkin' Donuts.
   Kingsbridge plans to file a formal report with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice under federal antitrust laws laws that relate to
acquisition of more than $15 million but less than 15 percent of
outstanding shares.
   Because of antitakeover provisions in the bylaws of Dunkin'
Donuts and a shareholder rights plan, Kingsbridge said in its SEC
filing, Kingsbridge has no immediate plan to acquire 15 percent or
more of Dunkin' Donuts.

<HEAD>Digital Reports Continued Fall In Earnings, Blaming Slow U.S. Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp.'s profit fell 16 percent in its latest
quarter, depressed by continued slow U.S. sales, the world's second
biggest computer maker said Thursday.
   Investors were prepared for the bad news and the stock was up
37{ cents a share at $99.37{ in midday trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   For the third fiscal quarter ended April 1, earnings fell to
$256.4 million, or $2.05 a share, from $305.1 million, or $2.33 a
share, on revenue of $2.8 billion, the Maynard, Mass.-based company
said.
   Revenue rose 10.7 percent to $3.13 billion from $2.82 billion a
year earlier.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, earnings fell 16.1
percent to $759.4 million, or $5.94 per share, from $904.6 million,
or $6.83 per share for the same nine months in 1988. Revenue rose
13.7 percent to $9.25 billion from $8.14 billion a year earlier.
   Digital, No. 2 in size behind International Business Machines
Corp., has suffered lagging earnings, and its stock price is about
half its peak of $199 a share in August 1987.
   Foreign business accounted for 57 percent of Digital's business
in the last quarter.
   Analysts said the company's U.S. results are suffering from
customer confusion over its new products and predicted the domestic
business would recover eventually.
   ``It looks a lot worse than it really is,'' said Terry Shannon,
an analyst at International Data Corp.
   Laura Conigliaro, a Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst,
said the company had done a good job of reducing costs. But she
said, ``It certainly smacks you in the face'' how sluggish U.S.
sales were.

<HEAD>U.S Leads World in Service Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hidden in the U.S. trade deficit statistics is
an area of strength that seldom if ever is revealed by traditional
measurements: The United States leads all other nations in the
export of services.
   Very little is ever said about this, simply because the usual
measurements emphasize goods. It is the same throughout the economy
_ you hear about the industrial production index but never about a
service production index.
   In spite of this, the majority of the American labor force and
most of the capital is utilized in the service sector. It isn't
true that America is doing less manufacturing, but it is true that
it is becoming more service oriented.
   Services? Think of all the services you buy _ medical, legal,
recreational, educational, transportation. Government is a service.
The tax preparer is a dispenser of services. Your insurance agent
and stockbroker are servicers.
   Among the service categories are transportation, communication,
electric, gas and sanitary services; wholesale trade; retail trade;
finance, insurance and real estate; personal and social services;
and public administration.
   Recognition of the importance of services is slow to develop,
however, not so much among the mass of Americans but among public
servants and their agencies. There is, for example, no official
services production index.
   That gap in economic measurements is now being corrected, not
solely by government but by the Coalition of Service Industries,
formed in 1982 by independent dispensers and users of services.
Public awareness is the goal.
   In pursuing that goal, they have just issued a report on the
international trade in services, written by economists Allen Sinai
and Zaharo Sofianou of the Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc.
Among the findings:
   _By country, the largest service exporter is the United States,
which accounted for 17.4 percent of total world service exports in
1987, followed by the United Kingdom, with a 12.4 percent share.
   _The United States had a favorable service export trade balance
of $19.7 billion in 1987. Canada, Japan and Australia had service
export deficits.
   _By country, the United States is not only the world's largest
service exporter and importer, but through 1987 had the world's
largest service trade surplus.
   In terms of public understanding, service exports and imports
don't break down as neatly as do domestic services, but they are
services nevertheless. Being intangible, they certainly cannot be
classified as goods. Sinai and Sofianou defined them as activities
involving the international transfer of money in return for
non-tangible benefits.
   And those benefits?
   The first category is shipment charges, including freight fees
and often the insurance costs of exporting merchandise. Next is
``other transportation,'' which is the price for transporting goods
for other countries.
   Travel is a big and rapidly growing item. Income on investments
made abroad is an important item. Interest income on foreign
securities is a major item, as is income from government services.
   A large category, ``Other Private Receipts on Services,''
includes a miscellaneous assemblage of services provided to
foreigners, including advertising, business and legal help.
   In such areas does the United States excel, even if it has been
unable to correct its imbalance of trade in goods. Unfortunately,
the news isn't all good: While it leads the world in service
exports, that lead is deteriorating.
   In 1981, the United States had a service export trade balance of
$42.1 billion, more than double the figure for 1987. Japan,
meanwhile, reduced its services trade deficit from $13.5 billion in
1981 to to $5.9 billion in 1987.
   Even more significant is the improvement in service trade
balances of developing nations. In 1981 they had a $108.5 billion
deficit. After remaining above $100 billion through 1984, the
deficit fell to $69.9 billion in 1987.
   The main factor contributing to the deterioration of the U.S.
position, Sinai and Sofianou said, is the higher payments to
foreigners for their holdings of U.S. securities.

<HEAD>West German Central Bank Hikes Key Rates, Others Follow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's central bank, citing continued
high monetary growth, unexpectedly raised key interest rates
Thursday, spurring other European banks to follow suit.
   The moves pushed the U.S. dollar to its lowest levels since
early March.
   The Bundesbank said it raised the discount rate 0.5 percentage
point to 4.5 percent and the Lombard rate to 6.5 percent from 6.0
percent to further curb above-target monetary growth. High
money-supply growth could fuel inflation.
   The Lombard rate is used for emergency funding and typically is
higher than the discount rate.
   The Bundesbank noted in a statement that ``monetary expansion in
the Federal Republic continues to be stronger than justifiable in a
stability-oriented policy.''
   The moves were followed by the Dutch central bank, which raised
its discount rate half a point to 5.5 percent. The Austrian
National Bank raised its discount and Lombard rates half a point to
5.0 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively.
   An official in France said the government isn't planning to
tighten its credit policy to match the Bundesbank's move. ``We
aren't dependent on the Germans,'' an Economics Ministry official
said, but he did not rule out a French rate hike if the franc's
stability were endangered or if inflationary pressures surface.
   Although the Swiss National Bank last week boosted its discount
rate half a point to 4.5 percent and the Lombard rate one point to
7.0 percent, financial markets were taken by surprise by Thursday's
apparently coordinated interest-rate action.
   The dollar fell more than 1.5 pfennigs to 1.8430 marks, its
lowest level since it finished at 1.8368 marks on March 1 in New
York.
   ``I don't think anyone expected this,'' said a foreign exchange
trader at a large Frankfurt bank. ``The market was totally relaxed.
There was no tension, no speculation, no pressure at all. The
Bundesbank has been saying for the last two months that there's no
inflation angst, that they'll keep close tabs on inflation, but at
the moment there's nothing to worry about.''
   Indeed, Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger said as
recently as last week that the central bank saw no need to raise
interest rates at present.

<HEAD>BankAmerica First-Quarter Earnings Leap 152 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp.'s turnaround continued in
the first quarter this year with record earnings of $275 million, a
152 percent increase from $109 million a year ago, the company
reported today.
   The parent of Bank of America, which lost $955 million in 1987
but rebounded last year to post a profit of $726 million, marked a
milestone in its recovery in the quarter when it reinstated a
dividend on its common stock.
   Earnings per common share were $1.38 in the first quarter, up
146 percent from 56 cents in the same period a year ago.
   ``Growth in net interest income, improved credit quality,
control over operating expenses, and the hard work and excellent
performance of our employees were key factors in the quarter's
achievements,'' said A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica chairman.
   Earnings in the first quarter included $46 million of Brazilian
cash interest payments, which increased net income by $38 million.
   The bank also benefited from higher interest rates as its net
interest margin climbed to 4.60 percent in the quarter, up from
3.66 percent for the same period last year.
   The provision for credit losses was $110 million for the
quarter, compared with $115 million for the same period last year
and $1.1 billion in all of 1987.
   Noninterest income, mostly from fees and commissions, in the
first quarter was $436 million, up $12 million from the first
quarter last year.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange fell
sharply Thursday following news that the West German central bank
raised its key discount rate by half a percentage point to 4.5
percent.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 22.6
points, or 1.1 percent, at 2,064.4. The index plunged as much as
33.5 points at late afternoon as the impact of the West German rate
move rippled through the market. At its best, the index was up 6.1
points shortly after the opening.
   Volume fell to 542.2 million shares from Wednesday's 663.7
million shares.
   The interest rate rise knocked the pound down against the
Deutsche mark, renewing fears that British interest rates might
soon be headed higher as well.
   ``Given where we see the currency at the moment, investors will
certainly be more worried about a rise in (British bank) base
rates,'' said Bill Smith, a market analyst at Prudential-Bache
Capital Funding (Equities) Ltd. in London.
   However dealers noted there was scant selling pressure to push
prices lower. Prices recovered from their lowest levels as
institutional investors entered the market to buy up some stock at
bargain prices.

<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Chemical Co. said Thursday its
first-quarter earnings rose 46.6 percent over the same period last
year, based partly on a strong increase in the company's core
chemical sales.
   Dow said it earned $743 million, or $4.08 a share, during the
January-March period this year, compared with earnings of $507
million, or $2.67 a share, during the same time last year.
   First-quarter sales of $4.49 billion this year set a company
record and were 12.7 percent over 1988 first-quarter sales of $3.98
billion.
   ``While rising interest rates in the U.S. may constrain the
interest-sensitive sectors of the economy,'' Dow President and
Chief Executive Officer Frank Popoff said in a statement, ``I'm
confident 1989 will be another record year for Dow based on the
quality of the first-quarter results and the continuing strength of
our global business.''
   The statement said sales in Dow's chemicals and performance
products segment rose 14 percent. Sales in Dow's plastics business
rose 11 percent and the company's consumer specialties segment
sales rose 9 percent.
   Part of the consumer products sales increase was offset by
promotional costs associated with the launch of Spiffits, a line of
toweletts premoistened with a variety of cleaning substances.

   Stock prices fell today as a weak dollar and
rising interest rates blunted the market's recent rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 90.91
points over the past four sessions, slumped 19.06 to 2,367.85 by 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 472 up, 946 down and
489 unchanged.
   Prices rose at the outset, but abruptly reversed course after
West Germany's central bank announced increases in its official
interest rates.
   The dollar fell in foreign exchange, and U.S. open-market
interest rates headed higher.
   Analysts cited fears that the Bundesbank's action would require
higher interest rates in this country to enable the dollar to hold
its ground against leading foreign currencies.
   In addition, brokers said some traders were eager to cash in on
the market's recent gains with stocks at their highest level in
more than 18 months.
   Digital Equipment bucked the downtrend, climbing ] to 99]. The
company reported earnings for the fiscal quarter ended April 1 of
$2.05 a share.
   That was down from $2.33 a share in the comparable period a year
earlier, but still better than most analysts had expected.
   Navistar led the active list, down | at 5]. The company said it
has reduced its internal earnings forecasts for the current quarter
and the full fiscal year that ends Oct. 31.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.04 to 170.66. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .08 at 340.35.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices closed moderately lower
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade following a National Weather
Service forecast for above-average precipitation next week in the
wheat fields of Kansas.
   Corn futures finished little changed, oats were higher and
soybeans were mixed, reflecting varied weather forecasts for the
Midwest, where spring planting is beginning.
   The Kansas winter-wheat crop has suffered through a cold, dry
winter and a relatively dry spring, giving rise to fears that much
of the crop could be lost.
   Wednesday's six-to-10-day forecast from the weather service
predicted above-normal precipitation in the region during the
middle portion of next week, easing some of the crop-damage fears.
   The weather service also predicted normal to above-normal
rainfall in the Midwest next week but many private meteorologists
foresee little rain.
   In addition to weather factors, soybean prices were buoyed by
rumors of new export business and by wire-service reports of high
radiation levels in western Russia almost three years after the
Chernobyl nuclear accident, which contaminated some of the Soviet
Union's best agricultural land.
   At the close, wheat was 2} cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.09 a bushel; corn was { cent
lower to } cent higher with May at $2.73 a bushel; oats were 1 cent
to 2 cents higher with May at $1.98 a bushel; soybeans were 3\

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 90.91
points over the past four sessions, slumped 17.96 to 2,368.95 by 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 490 up, 927
down and 505 unchanged.
   Prices rose at the outset, but abruptly reversed course after
West Germany's central bank announced increases in its official
interest rates.
   The dollar fell in foreign exchange, and U.S. open-market
interest rates headed higher.
   Analysts cited fears that the Bundesbank's action would require
higher interest rates in this country to enable the dollar to hold
its ground against leading foreign currencies.
   In addition, brokers said some traders were eager to cash in on
the market's recent gains with stocks at their highest level in
more than 18 months.
   Digital Equipment bucked the downtrend, climbing ] to 99] in
active trading. The company reported earnings for the fiscal
quarter ended April 1 of $2.05 a share.
   That was down from $2.33 a share in the comparable period a year
earlier, but still better than most analysts had expected.
   Navistar led the active list, down { at 5{. The company said it
has reduced its internal earnings forecasts for the current quarter
and the full fiscal year that ends Oct. 31.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .86 to 170.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .06 at 340.37.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 145.26 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>RJR Earnings Tumble In Wake Of Takeover, Smokeless Cigarette Failure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. reported a 62 percent drop in
first-quarter net income Thursday, blaming the decline on the costs
of its takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. and the failure of
its smokeless cigarette.
   The company reported net income of $103 million, down from $273
million in the same quarter a year ago, and earnings per share of
44 cents, down from $1.09 in the first quarter of 1988.
   Sales in the quarter were up 5 percent, to $4 billion from $3.8
billion in 1988.
   Without the merger-related costs and a charge for the
discontinued test of its Premier smokeless cigarette, earnings per
share would have been $1.41 and net income would have been up 17
percent to $320 million in the first quarter, RJR Nabisco said.
   ``If you adjust it, the earnings gains look good,'' said Emanuel
Goldman, an industry analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc. in San
Francisco.
   Also Thursday, RJR Nabisco officials refused comment on a Wall
Street Journal report that the consumer products company planned to
move its corporate headquarters from Atlanta to New York. The
Journal said the announcement could come at RJR Nabisco's annual
meeting next Thursday.
   There had been talk of a move back to North Carolina since the
Kohlberg Kravis takeover, but analysts noted that Louis Gerstner
Jr., RJR's new chairman and chief executive officer, is a New
Yorker.
   Gerstner, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., was president of
American Express Co. before his move to RJR Nabisco.
   ``Have you ever noticed how often a corporate headquarters ends
up not too far from the chief executive officer's abode?'' Goldman
said. ``It's not unheard of. It would not be a surprise. It would
be a surprise if it stayed in Atlanta.''
   RJR Nabisco moved its headquarters to Atlanta two years ago from
Winston-Salem, N.C., its home for more than a century.
   New York-based Kohlberg Kravis succeeded in its $25 billion
takeover of RJR Nabisco in February, and RJR said its first-quarter
results were reduced by $247 million because of ``change of
control'' costs associated with the merger.
   The industry ``norm'' for such costs no longer applies, said Bob
Young, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. ``LBO
(leveraged buyout) mergers have very high fees.''
   In a leveraged buyout, debt incurred to finance the acquisition
is repaid with the target company's cash flow or sale of its assets.
   Other merger-related costs will be reflected in earnings once
the merger is complete, the earnings statement said. A
stockholders' meeting to formally approve the merger is scheduled
for April 27.
   Test marketing of the smokeless Premier cigarette was
discontinued in February. RJR Nabisco said the failure resulted in
a $55 million charge against earnings in the first quarter.
   The company's R.J. Reynolds Tobacco subsidiary has said 700
employees will be offered early retirement or cash incentives to
leave their jobs as a result.
   Still, Gerstner said he saw a solid performance in the quarter
that ``demonstrates the basic strength of our tobacco and food
businesses and provides a foundation for continued progress.''

<HEAD>$50 Million Swindled Nationwide in California-Based Telemarketing
Scam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 investors nationwide lost in
excess of $50 million to California telemarketing firms raided in
the biggest-ever U.S. attack against ``boiler room'' scams,
authorities said Thursday.
   Securities investigators from seven states _ California, Texas,
Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas and New Mexico _ took part in
the April 11-18 raids on high-pressure boiler room operations
throughout California.
   Investigators said five people were arrested and booked for
investigation of securities or commodities fraud during raids at 12
California locations. In addition, approximately one ton of records
was seized.
   The arrests included Steve Scott Moleski, 29, of Lake Arrowhead;
Todd Thomas Roberts, 28, of suburban Woodland Hills; John Treat
Zimmerman, 35, of Escondido; Hiromichi Hiro Hirshara, 37, of Laguna
Hills; and Richard L. Besancon, 53, of Corona.
   At least five more arrests were anticipated. Six additional
arrests were made on unrelated outstanding warrants and
miscellaneous drug charges, authorities said.
   The unprecedented scale of the raids reflects a heightened
concern about the rapidly growing national problem of investment
telemarketing fraud, estimated to fleece consumers of $10 billion
annually, said Doug Mays, chairman of the North American Securities
Administrators Association Inc.
   Americans lose $1 million an hour to investment scams promoted
over the telephone, the Washington-based association said.
   ``We want to send a clear message to the hundreds of investment
con artists and swindlers here in Southern California _ crooks who
cheat tens of thousands of Americans out of billions of dollars
each year: We'll be back,'' said Mays, who is also the Kansas
securities commissioner.
   Telemarketing scams in the Los Angeles area result in up to $4
billion each year in investor losses, making it the investment scam
capital of the United States, according to a Southern California
Boiler Room Task Force report.
   
   ``These raids are motivated by a desire to make sure that
investment con artists who operate by phone know that they are
being watched and stand a good chance of getting arrested and
prosecuted,'' said
   The telemarketing firms targeted by investigators were promoting
interests in petroleum partnerships and unmined gold, so-called
``dirt pile'' scams, supposedly available to investors at half the
world spot-market prices.
   The seven-state telemarketing investigation was underwritten
with $175,000 from the federally-funded Leviticus Project
Association, comprised of 29 criminal justice and regulatory
agencies in 20 states.
   G.W. McDonald of the California Department of Corporations said
many of the victims were unsophisticated, first-time investors who
couldn't afford the losses but were attracted to the investments
because of lingering fears about the October 1987 stock market
crash.
   ``The elderly and retirees are also heavily represented in the
ranks of victims,'' he said.
   The firms raided were Midwest Petroleum of Los Angeles; S&amp;S
Petroleum of Lake Arrowhead; Vulcan Mining and Development and
Esmeralda Mining of Escondido; Westar International of Thousand
Oaks; Capital International Trading of Santa Ana; Frontier Energy
of Santa Ana; Cumberland Oil and Gas of Mission Viejo; Cambridge
Energy Ltd. of Los Angeles; Oxford Oil and Gas of Los Angeles; and
W. Scott &amp; Associates of Carlsbad.

<HEAD>Drexel Burnham To Close London Equity Trading Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said Thursday it would
close its London equity trading operations as part of the
restructuring of its worldwide business.
   Drexel said it would cease researching and making markets in
non-U.S. stocks from April 28. The company said it would try to
redeploy the 40 affected people elsewhere in the Drexel group.
   Drexel on Tuesday announced a major restructuring, involving the
sale of its retail brokerage operations and cutbacks in several
other areas. The move followed Drexel's settlement last week of
civil charges of violating securities laws, which were filed by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The firm blamed the restructuring on economic conditions and the
regulatory problems stemming from the SEC investigation of its U.S.
junk bond activities.
   Drexel's British equity operations are relatively small.
   Unlike some other U.S. investment firms, Drexel didn't purchase
a British brokerage in the run-up to the market deregulation of
October 1986, known as the Big Bang. Instead Drexel built up the
operations gradually, and currently makes markets in about 60
British stocks and 90 other European shares.
   Drexel said it would maintain its fixed income, commodities,
corporate finance and U.S. equity trading operations in London.

   Northrop Corp.'s chairman and chief

   Jones, who turns 69 this summer, will be replaced as chief

   Jones, who joined Northrop in 1953, will retain the chairman's

   Kresa was hired by Northrop in 1975 and has headed the aircraft
group, among other executive posts at the company.
   The succession was planned, the company said.

<HEAD>Survey: 2.6 Million New Jobs To Be Created in 1989</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Hold for release until 6 p.m. EST Thursday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small businesses should contribute more than
half of the 2.6 million new jobs estimated to be created this year,
according to a study released Thursday.
   But Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.'s annual survey of 5,000 firms noted
that the number of new jobs employers expect to create is down 26
percent from the 3.6 million new jobs actually created last year.
   While the slowdown had been expected, Dun &amp; Bradstreet corporate
economist Joseph Duncan said the forecast for 1989 ``is still
remarkably strong, especially in view of the substantial growth in
new jobs already achieved during the current economic expansion.''
   Since 1983, between 2 million and 4 million new jobs have been
created each year, he noted.
   Businesses with fewer than 100 employees will account for 56.6
percent of all the new jobs created this year, Dun &amp; Bradstreet
said. While firms with fewer than 20 workers said they plan to
increase employment by 3.5 percent, corporations with more than
25,000 employees expect their payrolls to increase by 0.8 percent.
   The survey showed that new positions in the wholesale, retail
and services sector should account for 56.5 percent of the overall
job gain; manufacturing jobs will account for 19.1 percent; while
finance, insurance and real estate positions will account for 8.9
percent of the year's employment gains.

<HEAD>Company Does Not Need Support Of Education Groups, Whittle Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whittle Communications LP does not need
the support of national education groups to have a successful
satellite news program in the country's classrooms, the company
chairman says.
   Chris Whittle said the Knoxville media company will spend the
next several months deciding if it wants to try to sell the news
concept to 10,000 school boards across the country.
   Testing of the daily 12-minute news programs, called Channel
One, ends Friday at six schools. Each program includes two minutes
of advertisements.
   Whittle, speaking Wednesday to an entrepreneurship class at
Belmont College, said he's optimistic Channel One will be continued.
   After the class, Whittle said he didn't anticipate the
controversy that has arisen about the news programs. He said he was
particularly upset by people who opposed the programs before they
viewed them or talked to anyone who did.
   ``They took a position before they did their homework,'' Whittle
said.
   Channel One can work without support from national education
groups because education ``is still locally controlled,'' he said.
   But he acknowledged, ``Having them against us doesn't make our
jobs any easier.''
   Whittle Communications has offered to install about $50,000
worth of video equipment in schools to beam in the news programs.
   But groups such as the National Association of Secondary School
Principals and the National Parent-Teacher Association objected to
the commercials, saying it was unfair to subject students to paid
advertising in classrooms.
   Whittle has said it plans to review resaearch compiled during
the seven-week test and talk with teachers, administrators and
students at the six test schools before deciding if it will make
the program available nationally in the fall of 1990. The company
also must determine if there is enough advertising support to
finance a national rollout. Equipment alone for the schools could
cost more than $100 million.
   The six test schools are in Knoxville; Kansas City, Kan.;
Cerritos, Calif.; Billerica, Mass.; Cincinnati and Detroit.
   On another topic, Whittle said the company probably will turn
the unprofitable ``Tennessee Illustrated'' publication into a
quarterly, rather than continue it as a bi-monthly.
   He said a major problem with the state magazine was that ``we
misjudged the size of our market.'' Finding advertisers for a
statewide audience, he said, has been difficult.
   Whittle Communications, founded in 1970 by Whittle and several
former University of Tennessee classmates, has pioneered a niche in
publishing by using single advertisers in its magazines, videos and
other products.
   The company's magazines are not sold through subscriptions or
newsstands, like typical publications but are available for free in
places such as doctors' offices and hairstyling salons.
   The company also uses one or a small number of advertisers each
giving exclusivity in their product categories in its 40 media
products.
   Whittle announced Tuesday it will begin producing short books
with advertisements beginning this fall.
   The books will have about 20 percent advertising and will be
written by prominent figures such as David Halberstam and John
Kenneth Galbraith.
   Whittle said the company's market research showed that many
people don't have time for lengthy non-fiction books and that they
will not object to ads in books.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $805 Million in Latest Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual
funds rose $805 million in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The increase, to $303.45 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.33 billion gain in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The rise, from the previous record of $302.51 billion set last
week, marked the 15th straight weekly all-time high for the funds'
assets and reflected the growing attraction of interest bearing
investments due to rising interest rates.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 233 general purpose funds rose $192.3 million to $99.82
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $372.2 million
to $130.25 billion, and assets of 140 institutional funds went up
$240.5 million to $73.38 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds
increased in the week ended Tuesday to 9.19 percent from 9.14
percent the previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund
Report, a trade journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 9.11 percent from 9.04 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds
lengthened to 34 days from 32 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts edged up
to 6.62 percent as of Wednesday from 6.61 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, stayed at 5.14 percent for the third straight week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.34
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, the same as the
previous week. Yields were 9.51 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 9.50
percent; 9.33 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 9.32 percent; and
9.20 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 9.21 percent.

   Nearly all of America's largest corporations
are contributing time, money or materials to local schools, but
most don't think their efforts have improved a troubled system,
says a study released Thursday.
   Top executives at 404 of the country's largest companies gave
public schools an average grade of C-minus. Not a single one rated
the schools excellent and only eight called them very good.
   The probject was sponsored by Fortune Magazine and Allstate
Insurance Co.
   Merle Sprinzen, director of market research for Fortune, said
the survey was conducted in the past two months to learn how the
education system is affecting corporations and how they are
responding.
   According to the survey, 64 percent of the executives believe
the system has deteriorated in the past decade and nearly half say
business productivity is down because of poor basic education. More
than a third of the companies offer remedial classes to employees
and nearly that many more say they are willing to do so in the
future.
   Asked to identify causes of public education problems, the
executives cited poorly disciplined and poorly motivated students,
uninvolved parents, undermotivated and undertrained teachers, and
low academic standards. Their suggested solutions included better
training and salaries for teachers, a longer school year and more
parental involvement.
   While 96 percent of the executives said their companies donate
time, materials or money to schools, only 22 percent felt their
efforts had made an impact on the quality of education in their
areas.
   The most common education activities were jobs and job
counseling to students, money and equipment for schools, and
encouraging employees to teach or serve on school boards, the
survey found. However, it also found that most energy and resources
were going to colleges, high schools and vocational schools. Only
35 percent of corporations were involved with elementary, junior
high or preschool students.
   Some corporations are taking broader action such as supporting
tax increases for education and lobbying their state legislatures
for changes, the survey found. But they were in the minority.
   The survey was released at an Allstate forum in conjunction with
a book on corporate response to deficiencies in the education
system. The book was presented to Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
and will be distributed to school districts and PTA chapters across
the country, according to Allstate vice president Ken Graham.
   Among other things, the book recommends more definitive
standards, higher pay and meaningful career paths for teachers; and
greater encouragement for corporate employees to run for school
boards and get involved in community education issues.
   Fortune sent questionnaires to chief executive officers of the
500 largest service corporations and the 500 largest industrial
corporations in the country.

<HEAD>Prizm: Neither Opulent Nor Spartan, It's A Good Family Car</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 Geo Prizm hatchback is a well-balanced, small family
car. It's eye-catching and stylish outside, but not racy. Its
interior strikes a nice balance _ neither spartan nor opulent. Its
engine and transmission perform smoothly yet you can expect good
fuel economy.
   Most of all, the Prizm, available in sedan and four-door
hatchback models, starts at under $10,000.
   Relatively new to showrooms _ it began arriving early this year
_ the Prizm is the top of the line of the new Geo nameplate that
Chevrolet is giving its dealers to attract more import car buyers.
   The Prizm is the Chevrolet dealers' replacement for the Nova,
that little subcompact praised for its quality but a bit lackluster
in its sales numbers.
   If the stares that the bright red Prizm test car got from
onlookers are any indication, the Prizm might have no trouble
surpassing the Nova. For starters, target buyers are a broad group.
   Chevrolet says they look to attract buyers with median age of 30
who have young families. It also looks for empty nesters with
median age of 45.
   Median household income ranges from $30,000 to $41,000, and 55
percent are likely to be women. About half will be college
graduates. Occupations range from clerical to managerial and
semi-professional, Chevrolet says.
   For these buyers, the Prizm is designed to care for the
practical family in style and comfort, the company says. The Prizm
LSI hatchback test car also had some features that reminded me of
higher-priced cars.
   For example, the rear hatchback styling seemed reminiscent of
the Acura Integra. And the LSI's full center console with cassette
storage was about as roomy as the one on the Mazda 929.
   As expected from the Fremont, Calif., plant where the Prizm is
built jointly by Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Corp. and
where the high-quality Nova also was produced, the test car had
superb fit and finish. Fuel economy was noteworthy. After 100 hard
miles, the needle on the fuel gauge hadn't budged.
   The 1.6-liter, fuel-injected, 16-valve, four-cylinder engine was
teamed with the optional three-speed automatic transmission and
responded reasonably well. It worked up to speed in a smooth,
timely manner. There were no jerks or whines. The dashboard gauges
were large and easy to read. There was plenty of room up front, but
it might be a close fit for three adults in back.
   Legroom in back was fine if the front seats were moved up some,
but knees would be hitting the back of the front seats if those
seats were pushed back all the way. In the LSI, the rear seatback
split and folded down for more cargo space. Be wary of tangling the
rear shoulder belts when pushing the seat back up, however.
   There was some road noise in the test car, but it was not overly
obtrusive. Four-wheel independent suspension helped ease the car
over bumps. One thing I didn't care for was the fact I had to move
the driver seat back to reach the remote fuel filler door lock and
to open the trunk from inside. The levers were difficult to reach
otherwise.
   Since the Prizm is a new car, Consumer Reports magazine has no
reports of owner troubles. Chevrolet said it had no projections for
sales this year.
   Competition is fierce in this market segment. Prizm competitors
include the Nissan Sentra, with a four-door model that starts at
more than $8,800, the Mazda 323, with a four-door model that starts
at more than $8,300, and the Honda Civic sedan, which starts at
more than $9,100.

<HEAD>Texas Instruments Will Spend $1.29 Billion on Research, Construction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. will spend $1.29 billion on
construction and research this year as the technology giant tries
to get more of the world's semiconductor and defense business, the
company said Thursday while reporting slightly lower first-quarter
earnings.
   At its annual stockholders' meeting, the company said it had net
income of $84.6 million, or 90 cents a share, on sales of $1.56
billion in the first three months of the year.
   That compares to $85.5 million, or 95 cents per share, on sales
of $1.47 billion in the same period last year.
   Texas Instruments' Chairman Jerry R. Junkins told stockholders
the Dallas-based company will spend $525 million on research and
development and $760 million in capital expenditures by the end of
the year.
   Chief financial officer Bill Aylesworth said $127 million
already had been spent in the first quarter and $150 million on
capital projects.
   Aylesworth said the research will focus on improvements in logic
devices on the semiconductor side and in improving radar technology
for defense systems.
   He said such research is ``the lifeblood'' of TI and is a key to
winning current and anticipated defense contracts.
   Meanwhile, Junkins warned shareholders not to expect too much
from TI's defense operations.
   During the past several months, TI has won defense contracts
that could be worth between $7 and $11 billion to the company.
   But Junkins said the department of defense is ``facing a period
of tight budget constraints, and they need more affordable
systems.''
   ``We are optimistic about the future of our defense electronics
business in the next decade, but we must be realistic about the
near-term environment,'' he said. ``It's going to be a tougher
period for defense contractors in general, and it means lower
near-term growth in our business.''
   Junkins also said the company was changing the thrust of its
commercial equipment sector to take advantage of ``a significant
opportunity for TI'' in advanced information management.
   ``In the past, much of our emphasis has been on hardware _
computers, controllers, terminals, etc. _ and our financial
performance has been totally unsatisfactory,'' Junkins said. ``For
the future, we are reorienting our strategies to put more emphasis
on applications software and system-level solutions, areas with
inherently higher margin potential.''
   Texas Instruments said its earnings were lower because of
decreased royalty income from its patents although Junkins said the
company expects to continue to receive royalty income well into the
90s.
   Royalty income was $32 million during the first quarter.
   TI, which invented the integrated circuit 30 years ago, earned
$366.3 million all of last year on sales of $6.29 billion.
   The company manufactures and sells semiconductors, defense
electronic systems, computer systems, various electrical systems
and consumer electronics products.

<HEAD>Dollar Sags On German Interest Rate Hike</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply in hectic trading
Thursday following interest rate hikes by West Germany's central
bank.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $385.25 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $382.80
late Wednesday.
   Currency markets in Europe and at home were stirred by the
surprise announcement that the Bundesbank had raised key interest
rates by half a percentage point. The central bank said it acted to
curb high monetary growth, which fuels inflation.
   The Dutch and Austrian central banks followed the Bundesbank
with interest rate hikes of their own.
   Trading was ``rocky,'' said Curtis Perkins, a dealer at Chemical
New York Capital Markets Group. ``The announcement came and whamo,
the dollar immediately dropped.''
   Although traders had been speculating about foreign rate hikes
for the past few weeks, Perkins noted that the timing of the
Bundesbank announcement was unsettling.
   Analysts said that in addition to wanting to stem inflationary
momentum, the West Germans increased rates to prevent capital from
flowing to Switzerland, which recently increased its key interest
rates.
   Concern is brewing that Britain and-or Japan may follow suit,
which would put further pressure on the dollar as well as the U.S.
economy, said Jack Barbanel, a senior vice president at Gruntal &amp;
Co.
   ``Money will move to those currencies where (interest rate)
yield is the highest and where there is greatest economic
stability,'' Barbanel said.
   While interest rate differentials still slightly favor the
dollar, ``our currency gets weaker on the possibility of an
economic slowdown here,'' he added.
   Earlier in Tokyo, before the German rate hike was announced, the
dollar rose to 132.28 Japanese yen, from 131.88 yen on Wednesday.
Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 132.10. In New York,
the dollar fell further to 131.15 yen, from 132.58 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7115 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.7113. In New York,
the pound cost $1.8467, more expensive than $1.7108 on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.8478 West German marks, down from 1.8623;
1.6295 Swiss francs, down from 1.6373; 6.2675 French francs, down
from 6.3040; 1,359.00 Italian lire, down from 1,364.38, and 1.1839
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1858.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.8450 West German marks, down from 1.8615;
1.6275 Swiss frtancs, down from 1.6360; 6.2925 French francs, down
from 6.3025; 2.0990 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0985; 1,361.50
Italian lire, down from 1,363.75, and 1.1840 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1865.
   Gold bullion prices were mixed. The late bid price in London was
$383.25 a troy ounce, down from $383.95. The Zurich late bid price
was $382.70, down from $383.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed
at $383.95 bid, up from $383.65.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $385.60 a troy ounce, from $383.40 on Wednesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.76 bid a troy ounce,
down from $5.79. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery rose to $5.776 an ounce, from $5.750 on Wednesday.

   Stock prices retreated Thursday as an unexpected
increase in West German interest rates put the dollar under
pressure in foreign exchange.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 90.91
points over the four previous sessions, dropped 9.53 to 2,377.38.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
599 up, 852 down and 517 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 175.97 million
shares, down from 191.51 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 208.04 million shares.
   Prices rose at the outset, but abruptly reversed course after
West Germany's central bank announced increases in its official
interest rates.
   The dollar fell in foreign exchange, and U.S. open-market
interest rates headed higher.
   Analysts cited fears that the Bundesbank's action would require
higher interest rates in this country to enable the dollar to hold
its ground against leading foreign currencies.
   Even if the dollar doesn't weaken further, many observers said
the higher rates in West Germany significantly reduced any chance
that the Federal Reserve might ease U.S. credit policy any time in
the near future.
   In addition, brokers said some traders were eager to cash in on
the market's recent gains with stocks at their highest levels in
more than 18 months.
   Digital Equipment bucked the downtrend, climbing | to 99| in
active trading. The company reported earnings for the fiscal
quarter ended April 1 of $2.05 a share.
   That was down from $2.33 a share in the comparable period a year
earlier, but still better than most analysts had expected.
   Navistar led the active list, down { at 5{. The company said it
has reduced its internal earnings forecasts for the current quarter
and the full fiscal year that ends Oct. 31.
   Weyerhaueser jumped 3\ to 30\. The company reported
first-quarter profits of 70 cents a share, up from 54 cents in the
like period last year.
   Harnischfeger gained 2| to 19\ amid takeover speculation. The
company said it had no plans for anything that would explain the
rise in its stock price.
   John Fluke Manufacturing, traded on the American Stock Exchange,
rose 3\ to 24. The company began a tender offer for 1.5 million
shares of its stock in a price range of $22 to $25 apiece.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $5.07 billion, or 0.17
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .40 to 171.30.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .92 to 353.38, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down .96 at 306.19.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped .40 to 421.51. At the Amex, the market value index closed
at 341.33, up .90.

<HEAD>Teachers Tell Businesses To `Think Again' Before Locating In Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of disgruntled Washington teachers
warn in a newspaper advertisement that businesses considering
expanding into the state to ``think again.''
   ``Our educational system is in decline. ... We can't guarantee
you a quality worker because our state won't pay for quality
schools,'' said the ad placed in Thursday's West Coast edition of
The Wall Street Journal.
   It placed much of the blame on Gov. Booth Gardner and the state
Legislature. A spokesman for the governor called the ad
counterproductive.
   Jon Holdaway, a vocal-arts and drama teacher at Cedarcrest
Junior High School in Spanaway, just south of Tacoma, purchased the
ad on behalf of a group called Washington Teachers United For Fully
Funded Schools.
   He said about 500 teachers helped pay $1,400 to place the ad,
which was carried in the Journal's edition distributed in 13
Western states, including Alaska and Hawaii.
   Holdaway said it was unrealistic to think the ad would change
any businessman's mind in expanding business into Washington.
However, he said, ``I do fear that in the future businesses won't
be able to get qualified workers, and that's a far greater threat
to business in our state.''
   The ad said Washington has the fourth-largest class size in the
nation, ranks 46th in textbook purchases per student and 50th in
change in teacher salaries.
   One-fourth of the state's school buildings are unsafe or
inadequate, the ad said, adding, ``Our governor and Legislature
refuse to support full funding of our public schools.''
   Gardner and the Legislature, whose annual session ends after
this week, have been considering various proposal for funding
education, none of which are considered full support.
   Teachers have criticized Gardner for refusing to appropriate
part of a $400 million state budget windfall to boost teachers'
salaries.
   ``We have an image, `Come to Washington because we have a
well-educated population,''' Holdaway said. ``But we have a
mediocre education system in this state. It used to be one of the
best.''
   Holdaway cited as his sources various studies done by the
National Education Association, the Education Writers Association
and the Corporation for Enterprise Development.
   Dick Milne, spokesman for Gardner, said the governor considers
education a priority. ``We acknowledge that there are some areas
that we would like to do better,'' he said. ``Class size is one of
those. Teacher salaries is another.''
   Senate Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan McDonald,
R-Bellevue, defended legislative action, saying the Senate's
version of a state budget now in conference with the House contains
$512 million in enhancements for education.
   Richard Page, chief administrator of the Washington Roundtable,
which represents business interests in the education system, said
the ad does identify serious weaknesses in the system.
   ``It's a bit alarmist, but I applaud him,'' Page said. ``There
are lots of ways to quibble with his points. It's easy to say he's
off base. But the Roundtable and business in general agree there
are serious flaws in our public education system.''
   Page said, however, that Holdaway and the teachers group were
misrepresenting Washington's educational system by excluding some
of its strengths. For example, state residents have completed more
years of schooling than residents of at least 45 other states, and
its Scholastic Achievement Tests consistently are above average, he
said.
   Ronn Robinson, Gardner's education assistant, was less
understanding about the one-sided picture Holdaway painted.
   ``I think it's unfortunate that he feels impelled to take out
such an ad, which misrepresents the degree to which our schools are
(standing) compared to others,'' Robinson said. ``Our salaries are
not as bad as this ad implies.''
   Cliff Finch, legislative affairs counsel for the Association of
Washington Business, said he believed readers would not take the ad
seriously.
   ``I think the readership of that newspaper is too sophisticated
to take that (ad) at face value,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ford Gets Into Quickie Oil Change Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. says it had jumped into the
growing quick oil-change business, a move that could affect
thousands of small businesses nationwide.
   ``I hope it hurts him,'' service manager Harold Grass of
Fairlane Ford in Dearborn, Mich., said of a Quaker State Minit-lube
shop across Michigan Avenue from his dealership.
   Apparently, it already has.
   ``It's slowed down some,'' Minit-lube employee Ken Matchette
said Thursday.
   Even though Grass has had his quick oil-change business running
since October, he's still only getting a fraction of the business
that the Minit-lube enjoys. Fairlane Ford averages about 15 of the
fast oil changes a day, compared with 70 to 80 daily at Minit-lube.
   John Kerekanich, accessory merchandising manager for Ford's
parts and service division, said quick oil-change service
operations began in the early 1980s and have grown steadily since
then. He speculated there would be about 6,000 of them nationwide
by 1992.
   Like the smaller, stand-alone oil-change operations, he added,
no appointment is necessary, the work will be done within 15
minutes and will cost about $20.
   Grass said his dealership completes the average oil change in
seven or eight minutes and charges $19.95, $2 less than the
Minit-lube.
   Ford's pilot program began last June with five dealers in
Chicago and expanded to 25 nationwide in October, Kerekanich said.
Ford expects the program to grow to about 35 percent of its 5,600
Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealers in the United States.
   He said not all dealers are suited for the program, which will
require a separate area in the service bay and a separate billing
area _ the main reasons Chrysler Corp. hasn't gotten into the
business.
   ``Our feeling is that there are some difficulties that have not
been resolved yet in terms of being able to match the
convenience,'' of the drive-through operations, Chrysler spokesman
Tom Houston said. He said the company did a survey of dealerships a
few years ago and found no overwhelming desire for such a
corporation-sponsored service.
   General Motors Corp. spokesman Duane Poole said the nation's
largest automaker is looking into the matter, but did not
anticipate a decision soon.
   Kerekanich said a Ford dealer could invest up to $22,000 to
start the quick oil-change operation, depending on the available
facilities. Grass converted an unused car-wash bay, cutting his
initial costs. He also said he has hired two people just for the
oil change operation.
   Kerekanich also said Ford is encouraging its dealers to offer
the service to all makes and models of cars, something that Grass
has declined.
   ``Sorry ... Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles only,'' he said.

<HEAD>NWA Reports $12.6 Million First-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Northwest-Davis, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines
and the target of a hostile takeover, Thursday reported its largest
first-quarter profit of the decade.
   Billionaire oilman Marvin Davis on Thursday launched a
$90-a-share hostile tender offer for NWA. The company's board of
directors earlier rejected a similar offer as inadequate.
   First-quarter net earnings of $12.6 million, or 43 cents a
share, marked the first time in four years NWA has posted
first-quarter net earnings, the company said.
   The $12.6 million profit compares with a net loss of $43.5
million in the first quarter of 1988.
   ``These results counter our traditional financial performance in
a cyclical industry where the first quarter, with its lower travel
demand, has typically resulted in net losses,'' said Steve
Rothmeier, NWA chairman and chief executive officer. ``In fact, our
earnings for the first three months of 1989 are outstanding
first-quarter results.''
   First-quarter revenue increased 19.3 percent to $1.48 billion
from $1.24 billion a year earlier.
   The quarter was marked by double-digit growth in both passenger
and freight revenue, the company said.
   ``Hand-in-hand with these solid financial results is growing
evidence of the quality of our customer service,'' Rothmeier said.
   ``The most recent government statistics reveal Northwest as the
nation's second most on-time airline, exceeding the industry
average on-time performance by 8 percentage points,'' he said.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three measures of the nation's money supply
rose in early April, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
$500 million in the week ended April 10 to a seasonally adjusted
$781.5 billion from $781.0 billion the previous week.
   The central bank said a broader measure called M2 rose $2
billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,084.3 billion from $3,082.3
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose $7.7 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $3,966.3 billion from $3,958.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of
3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent

early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,073.8 billion, a 1.9

$227 million the previous week and the highest since borrowings
averaged $1.37 billion in the week ended Jan. 4.
   The Fed said the heavy borrowings in the latest week were due
mostly to a surge in borrowings Wednesday night reflecting a

<HEAD>Precious Metals Advance On German Rate Hike, Fusion Speculation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold and silver futures prices rose moderately Thursday on New
York's Commodity Exchange after surprise increases in two key West
German interest rates knocked down the dollar.
   Meanwhile, platinum and palladium prices surged on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on renewed speculative buying linked to recent
nuclear-fusion experiments.
   On other markets, petroleum prices were broadly mixed; wheat
prices fell while most other grains and soybeans advanced; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold settled $2.20 to $2.60 higher with the contract for
delivery in June at $389.30 a troy ounce; silver was 2.2 cents to
2.6 cents higher with May at $5.787 a troy ounce.
   The rise in gold and silver prices corresponded with a drop in
the dollar's value against other major currencies following
increases of 0.5 percent in the West German discount rate and West
Germany's equivalent of the prime lending rate.
   Currency traders responded to the increased lending rates by
buying West German marks and selling U.S. dollars. A weaker dollar
promotes foreign purchases of U.S. goods, which helps the U.S.
economy and could lead to higher inflation in this country.
   Gold and silver are generally viewed as investment hedges
against inflation, so demand for the metals tends to rise and fall
with inflationary expectations.
   A sharp increase in crude-oil and unleaded gasoline prices also
fanned inflation fears and contributed to gold's rally, analysts
said.
   Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal &amp;
Co. in New York, said gold's chart patterns indicated a bullish
trend in the making. He noted that gold for June delivery had
bottomed out at $385.70 an ounce on Wednesday and $385.80 an ounce
on Thursday, indicating the market was unlikely to fall below that
area.
   ``We've formed a good bottom here and I think this market is
getting ready to surprise everyone,'' Cardillo said.
   Jitters about cold-fusion research persisted in the platinum and
palladium markets. Both metals have been used in recent experiments
in which scientists claim to have recreated in a jar of water the
nuclear reaction that powers the sun and stars.
   Platinum settled $6.70 to $8.20 higher with July at $556.20 a
troy ounce; palladium was $7.80 higher across the board with June
at $174.85 a troy ounce.
   Crude-oil and unleaded gasoline futures rose sharply on the New
York Merc on supply fears linked to the shutdown of a North Sea oil
rig Tuesday following an explosion.
   Heating oil futures prices fell, though, reflecting expectations
for more spring-like weather in the northeastern United States.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 47
cents higher with June at $21.28 a barrel; heating oil was was .40
cent to 1.04 cents lower with May at 52.29 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .75 cent lower to 1.13 cents higher with May at 74.64
cents a gallon.
   Wheat futures moved lower on the Chicago Board of Trade
following a National Weather Service forecast for above-average
precipitation next week in the wheat fields of Kansas.
   Corn futures finished little changed while oats and soybeans
were slightly higher, reflecting conflicting weather forecasts for
the Midwest, where spring planting is beginning.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 4 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.09\ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to } cent
higher with May at $2.72} a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2{ cents
higher with May at $1.98 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 5
cents higher with May at $7.47{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures finished mostly higher on firmer cash markets and
perceptions that Wednesday's steep losses were overdone.
   Frozen pork bellies fell to new life-of-contract lows for the
second consecutive day amid expectations that Friday's monthly cold
storage report from the Agriculture Department will show record
levels of bellies in the nation's commercial freezers.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .55 cent higher with June
at 71.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .25
cent higher with May at 75.62 cents a pound; live hogs were .43
cent lower to .15 cent higher with June at 45.47 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .65 cent lower to .05 cent higher with May
at 30.95 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Stock Award to Investors Upheld</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court on Thursday let
stand a jury verdict awarding an investor group 20 percent of the
stock of the computer franchise giant ComputerLand.
   In a case that started with a $250,000 loan, the court
unanimously denied a hearing on an appeal by ComputerLand and its
founder, William Millard, from a lower-court ruling upholding the
stock award.
   During the lawsuit, Millard was driven from control of the
Oakland-based company.
   Herbert Hafif, lawyer for the investor group, called Micro-Vest,
estimated the worth of ComputerLand at $500 million. He said
Micro-Vest would own 28.5 percent of Computerland, including an
additional 8.5 percent under terms of an earlier settlement.
   The $250,000 loan was made to Millard more than 12 years ago, in
the early stages of his venture. It gave the lender the right to
exchange the note for 20 percent of the stock in Millard's
business. Micro-Vest later bought the note and sued Millard after
he refused to transfer the stock in 1981.
   An Alameda County Superior Court jury awarded Micro-Vest 20
percent of ComputerLand and $141 million in damages. The damages
were dropped in December 1985 in a partial settlement that included
additional stock as well as Millard's resignation from the
company's board.
   Computerland now operates under new management.
   In appealing the jury verdict, Millard argued that the
stock-conversion feature of the original $250,000 loan applied only
to his original computer company, called IMS. He said the company
went out of existence after a merger.
   He also said he had agreed orally with one of the original
lenders that the note and stock option would not be transferred
without Millard's consent.
   The 1st District Court of Appeal rejected those arguments in a
ruling Dec. 29.

   Dunkin' Donuts Inc. said Thursday it will sell
more than a million shares of stock to employees and cut its
corporate work force 14 percent after a Toronto-based investment
bank made hostile overtures for the doughnut giant.
   Dunkin' Donuts said it would fight any takeover bid by
Kingsbridge Capital Group, a subsidiary of Unicorp Canada Corp.,
which said it acquired a 6.6 percent stake and may seek control of
the doughnut maker with more than 1,700 stores worldwide.
   ``We don't know who these people are,'' said Richard N. Hart
Jr., Dunkin' Donuts vice president and treasurer. ``Our intention,
of course, has been to still be an independent company.''
   Dunkin' Donuts _ whose ads feature a man rising in the middle of
the night because he's ``gotta go make the doughnuts'' _ announced
it was consolidating doughnut shop operations and trimming its
corporate work force by about 80 people.
   The company said it plans to sell 1.1 million shares of common
stock to employees and to continue purchasing its stock on the open
market, in two apparent antitakeover measures.
   It also said it amended its bylaws to allow stockholders to buy
twice their holdings if a single buyer acquires 15 percent of the
company.
   In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Kingsbridge Capital Group said it would continue to buy Dunkin'
Donuts stock and raised the possibility of a leveraged buyout.
   Kingsbridge said its options included buying up more shares of
Dunkin' Donuts, proposing a merger, mounting a hostile takeover or
a waging proxy battle for control of the company's board.
   Kingsbridge said it has spent $13.4 million in buying 422,000
shares of Dunkin' Donuts, 6.6 percent of the shares outstanding as
of Feb. 28.
   The action sent Dunkin' Donuts stock shooting up $1.62{ to close
at $37.87{ in over-the-counter trading Thursday.
   Dunkin' Donuts owns or franchises 1,786 stores in the United
States, Mexico, Canada and Japan, with total sales last year of
$750 million, according to Wall Street analysts.
   The company reported 1988 earnings of $13.5 million, or $2.05 a
share, on revenue of $112.8 million.
   Analysts said they believe the prosperous and well-known
doughnut-maker would fight a takeover bid.
   ``Here is a company has not had a down year since 1974,'' said
Willard W. Brown, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York.
   ``There is no question in my mind that this company is extremely
well managed,'' he said. ``Since 1974 there have been several
recessions and they continue to make money every year.''
   The most Kingsbridge could afford to pay per share, without
selling off real estate or other major assets, would be $40 per
share, Brown said, and Dunkin' Donuts stock already is near that
figure.
   ``We can't see anything over $40. It looks real difficult to do
that,'' Brown said.
   Kingsbridge said it plans to file a formal report with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino laws relating to acquisition of more than $15
million but less than 15 percent of a company's outstanding shares.
   Because of Dunkin' Donuts' antitakeover provisions bylaws and
shareholder rights plan, Kingsbridge said it has no immediate plans
to acquire 15 percent or more of Dunkin' Donuts.

   Britain's state-run Girobank, which operates
through post offices, will be sold for 130 million pounds, or $222
million, to a savings and loan society, the government said
Thursday.
   Girobank has become the sixth-largest bank in Britain since it
was set up by the Labor Party government in 1968 to provide cheap
and easy banking in competition with the big clearing banks.
   It has 2.5 million customers doing business through the mail and
at the country's 20,000 post offices.
   Girobank's net assets are valued at around 100 million pounds,
or $171 million dollars.
   The offer from the Alliance and Leicester Building Society was
one of four bids and was accepted after the government failed to
find a satisfactory buyer last year. To prevent a reduction of
competition, the clearing banks were barred from bidding.
   The Post Office said Girobank will continue to operate through
post offices and it expects the deal to be completed by early
summer.
   Girobank is the latest state enterprise to be sold off by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives, who are rolling back
the nationalization carried out by the socialist Labor governments.
   Other sales have included British Petroleum, British Gas,
airports, docks, trucking, Jaguar cars, British Telecom and British
Aerospace.

<TEXT>
   The publisher and chief executive of The Detroit
News, Louis A. Weil III, has been selected as the publisher of the
U.S. edition of Time magazine, it was announced Thursday.
   The selection of the veteran newspaper executive to become the
12th publisher in the 66-year history of Time magazine was part of
a broader realignment of senior management within the Time Inc.
Magazine Co.
   Under the realignment, Time publisher Robert L. Miller becomes
worldwide publisher in charge of overseeing the U.S. edition of
Time magazine as well as Time International, People and Sports
Illustrated.
   Reginald Brack, chairman, president and chief executive of
Time's magazine operations, said Miller's expanded responsibilities
and Weil's appointment ``will enable us to better leverage Time
Inc.'s unique strength as the only American publisher of mre than
one weekly magazine.''
   Weil, 48, began his publishing career with the Times-Herald of
Port Huron, Mich., in 1966.
   He later rose to the position of publisher at the Journal &amp;
Courier in Lafayette, Ind., which was acquired by Gannett Co. Inc.
   In the Gannett organization, Weil became president and publisher
of the Westchester-Rockland newspaper chain, based in White Plains,
N.Y.
   He was named president of the Detroit News in 1986 and added the
titles and responsibilities of publisher and chief executive a year
later.
   In his new post, Weil will report to Miller.
   Meanwhile, Gannett announced that Robert H. Giles has been named
editor and publisher of The Detroit News.
   Giles is currently vice president and executive editor of The
News.

<HEAD>Profit Up, But Timber Giant To Sell Some Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Promising a ``significantly changed
Weyerhaeuser Co.,'' the wood-products giant said Thursday it would
review its businesses, reorganizing and selling those that might do
better on their own, to increase returns to shareholders.
   While the company reported a 29 percent increase in profit
Thursday for a record first quarter, Chairman and Chief Executive
George Weyerhaeuser said that wasn't good enough.
   ``Our performance overall is not satisfactory to us in
competitive terms,'' he told shareholders.
   President John Creighton said the review of businesses, which
include pulp and paper, timber products, real estate, mortgage
financing, nursery supply and personal care products, would begin
next month.
   ``The effort is focused primarily on developing improvement
strategies and plans for achieving a leadership position in each
and every business sector in which we choose to compete,'' he said.
   The review would appear to put at risk at least part of the
century-old company's traditional timber business, especially
logging and milling. While its pulp and paper mills have been
highly profitable in recent years, it has said it would get rid of
its logging operations altogether, and give the work to contract
loggers, if its workers didn't accept what amounted to major pay
cuts.
   ``A significantly changed Weyerhaeuser Co. will emerge as the
outcome of these efforts,'' said Creighton. ``I expect it to have
fewer, and a less complex group of, businesses.''
   Weyerhaeuser reported its profit for the quarter ended March 26
was $148 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with $115 million,
or 54 cents a share, for the same quarter in 1988.
   Sales also hit a first-quarter record at $2.3 billion, up 9
percent.
   The board also declared a dividend of 30 cents per share on
common stock, payable May 30 to shareholders of record on April 28.
   Weyerhaeuser said the arctic cold front that hammered the
country in February hit the company hard, but that strength in pulp
and paper markets and in Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co. dealings
contributed to the improvement in earnings.
   He said weak spots included Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Co., which was
buffeted by higher interest rates; nursery supply, due to the
weather; and personal care products, due to development costs.

<TEXT>
   3M Co.'s said Thursday its first-quarter
income rose 15.1 percent, in part due to higher worlwide sales by
the diversified manufacturer.
   3M reported earnings of $318 million, or $1.43 a share, compared
with $277 million, or $1.22 a share, for the same 1988 period.
   Sales for the quarter hit $3 billion, up 7.5 percent from $2.8
billion in the first quarter of 1988.
   ``All four of our business sectors contributed to the record
results,'' 3M Chairman Allen F. Jacobson said. ``We increased
earnings through solid worldwide volume gains and successful
efforts to reduce costs and increase efficiency.''
   Jacobson said 3M noticed strong demand overseas for its
products, with international unit volume up 14 percent from the
first quarter a year ago.
   3M said cost of goods sold declined to 57.6 percent of sales,
compared with 58.1 percent in the same quarter last year. Expenses
fell to 23.9 percent of sales, down from 24.3 percent in the
year-earlier period, the company said.

   Amoco Corp. said Thursday its first-quarter profit fell about 2
percent due to a $57 million special charge stemming from a
restructuring of its exploration and production operations.
   Phillips Petroleum Co., meanwhile, posted a 46 percent gain in
net earnings and Amerada Hess Corp.'s first-quarter profit more
than doubled, the companies said.
   For the three months ended March 31, Chicago-based Amoco said
its after-tax earnings were $458 million, or 89 cents a share, down
from $469, or 91 cents a share, in the similar year-ago period.
   Revenue totaled $6.5 billion, up 14 percent from $5.7 billion
the the 1988 quarter.
   Amoco, the nation's fifth-largest oil company, said the $57
million charge was associated with a previously announced work
force reduction and consolidation of exploration and production
activities.
   Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., said its profit totaled
$190 million, or 78 cents a share, compared with $130 million, or
55 cents a share, in the 1988 quarter.
   The company's revenue totaled $3.1 billion, up from $2.9 billion
in the year-earlier period.
   New York-based Amerada Hess posted a profit of $220 million, or
$2.70 a share, compared with net income of $65.6 million, or 80
cents a share, for the first quarter of 1988.
   Revenue came to $1.5 billion, up from $1.26 billion a year
earlier.

   Publisher Houghton Mifflin Co. said Thursday it had a larger
loss in the first quarter than it had a year earlier, while Western
Publishing Group Inc. said its profit rose 16.1 percent in its
latest quarter.
   Houghton Mifflin, based in Boston, said it normally has a loss
in the first quarter because of the seasonal textbook ordering
pattern followed by schools.
   It said it lost $11.3 million in the first three months of the
year compared with a loss of $9.6 million a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 10.9 percent to $43.6 million from
$39.3 million a year earlier.
   Harold T. Miller, chairman and chief executive, said the larger
loss was due to increased development expense and higher selling
and smapling costs.
   Western Publishing, based in New York, said it earned $6.5
million, or 31 cents a share, in its fourth quarter ended Jan. 28
compared with $5.6 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 6 percent to $141 million from $133
million a year earlier.
   For the year, Western had a profit of $29.9 million, or $1.45 a
share, up 38.4 percent from $21.6 million, or $1.08 a share, a year
earlier.
   Full-year revenue rose 20.6 percent to $551.4 million from
$457.4 million a year earlier.
   Western Publishing sells Golden Books for children and also
makes and markets games, puzzles, children's video and special

   It also is a commercial printer, makes disposable paper
tableware and party goods, stationery and promotional business

<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. reported Thursday that its
first-quarter profit rose 45 percent, boosted by strong performance
in its pulp and paper operations.
   The Atlanta-based wood and paper products company said its
first-quarter profit was $154 million, or $1.65 a share, up from
$106 million, or $1.02 a share, in the same quarter of 1988.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $2.4 billion, up from $2.1
billion in the year-earlier period.
   Pulp and paper operating profits soared to $247 million for the
quarter, up from $116 million for the 1988 quarter. Building supply
profits were off slightly, to $99 million from $108 million for the
first quarter a year ago.
   T. Marshall Hahn Jr., chairman and chief executive officer,
blamed a drop in housing starts for the lower housing supply
profits.
   He said the increased profit in paper products was due to the
acquisition of properties in Brunswick, Ga., and the startup of
major capital projects such as a paper machine in Port Hudson, La.
   The company also said it repurchased about 2.7 million shares of
its common stock during the quarter at a cost of about $108
million. Georgia-Pacific has bought back a total of 19.1 million
shares since its repurchase program began in 1987.

<TEXT>
   American Express Co. Thursday reported a 3.7
percent profit decline in the first quarter from a year earlier
when the big travel and financial services concern made $19 million
from a discontinued operation.
   The deterioration in earnings occurred despite a 21.4 percent
expansion in revenue.
   American Express said its after-tax earnings amounted to $251.9
million, or 59 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31,
compared to $261.6 million, or 61 cents a share, in the comparable
1988 period.
   Revenue totaled $5.87 billion, up from $4.83 billion a year
earlier.
   Last year's first-quarter profit included $19 million in
earnings from the Fireman's Fund Corp. and from a gain on the sale
of the insurance unit's common stock. In its bookkeeping, American
Express now treats Fireman's Fund Corp. as a discontinued operation.
   A $15 million first-quarter loss registered at American Express'
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. brokerage impaired the parent company's
bottom line. American Express owns about 60 percent of Shearson.
   Shearson, which released its financial results on Wednesday,
attributed the loss to weak activity on Wall Street, higher
interest rates and a $35.2 million pre-tax write-down of MCorp
securities held by the firm. In the first quarter of 1988, Shearson
had a $75 million-profit, or 75 cents a share, after taxes.
   The Travel Related Services division, which includes the credit
card and travelers check businesses and is the largest operation of
American Express, performed strongly in the first quarter.
   Net income in this division grew 18.5 percent to a first-quarter
record of $185.4 million from $156.5 million. The number of credit
cards in force rose 15 percent to 32.4 million.

   PaineWebber Group Inc., one of the biggest
American brokerage houses, reported a 55.7 percent tumble in
first-quarter earnings Thursday and attributed it to a general
slump in the securities business.
   The company said earnings for the three months ended March 31
totaled $9.18 million, vs. $20.76 million in the year-earlier
quarter. Earnings per share, after deducting preferred stock
dividends, totaled 11 cents, vs. 48 cents a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenues totaled $396.97 million, a 13 percent
decline from $457.31 million in the 1988 first quarter.
   Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive, said the results
reflected ``the negative impact of a difficult trading environment
and sluggish investor activity.''
   Marron said the company has been attempting to cut expenses by
reducing its support staff and marginally profitable businesses. He
said the steps taken so far ``have had a positive effect on our
cost base.''
   Several major Wall Street firms have reported depressed
first-quarter earnings, raising the probability of more layoffs and
shrinkage in an industry that has never recovered from the effects
of the October 1987 stock market crash.
   PaineWebber, based in New York, is the seventh-largest U.S.
brokerage, with a capital base of more than $1.4 billion and a
staff of 12,600 people in 286 offices worldwide.

<HEAD>Ceramics Company Agrees To Divest Defense-Related Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HASKELL, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>

   General Ceramics Inc. and federal officials
continued to work on an agreement Thursday that would allow the
company to be purchased by a Japanese firm, officials said.
   Desiree Tucker Sorini, a U.S. Treasury Department spokeswoman,
said she could not confirm published reports that General Ceramics
agreed to divest itself of defense-related operations to allow it
to be acquired by Tokuyama Soda Co. of Japan.
   The Treasury Department is part of the interagency Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States, which is reviewing the
acquisition.
   But Ms. Sorini said the company had withdrawn its notice of sale
from the interagency panel, gaining it time to physically transfer
equipment to a new owner if it is divesting.
   Carolyn Gagas, a company spokeswoman, declined to discuss the
deal Thursday.
   Ms. Gagas referred to a company statement released Monday that
said Tokuyama Soda expects to proceed with the proposed transaction
when ``arrangements satisfactory to the government have been worked
out.''
   General Ceramics is the sole supplier of beryllium oxide parts
used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. The company holds a
classified contract with Martin-Marietta Energy Systems Inc., the
primary contract operator of the Defense Department's vast Y-12
plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn.
   If the company divests itself of defense-related aspects of its
business, the panel is likely to recommend that President Bush
allow Tokuyama Soda to take over General Ceramics, officials have
said.
   The law under which the Bush administration stopped the
acquisition was passed in August. It gives the administration the
power to go to court to block deals that endanger national security.
   This was the first time a foreign acquisition had been blocked
since enactment of the law, said Douglas Elmets, an Energy
Department spokesman.
   The Committee on Foreign Investment is composed of
representatives of the Treasury, State, Commerce, Defense, Justice
and Energy departments and the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative.
   Earlier this year, Bush cleared Monsanto Co.'s sale of a silicon
wafer-manufacturing division to Heuls AG of West Germany after a
similar review by the panel.

<HEAD>Coleman Family To Tender To Perelman</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of ``Perelman'' throughout.</HEAD>

   The founding family of Coleman Co. said
Thursday it will tender its stake to takeover specialist Ronald O.
Perelman, who has made a $545 million bid for the outdoor products
company.
   Coleman Chairman and Chief Executive Sheldon C. Coleman,
grandson of the company's founder, said he and other family members
and the trusts they control would tender their approximately
1,880,000 shares to Lantern Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Perelman's MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc.
   ``We believe that the way the MacAndrews &amp; Forbes offer was
structured virtually assures its success regardless of our
actions,'' Sheldon C. Coleman said. ``At this point, the Coleman
family believes it is in the best interests of our company to
support the new owners and work toward building an exciting future
for the people of Coleman.''
   A definitive merger agreement was announced last month under
which Perelman would acquire Coleman for $74 a share in cash,
topping a family offer to take the company private for $68 per
share in cash and stock.
   Coleman is the world's largest manufacturer of outdoor
recreation products including its famous lanterns, cookstoves and
coolers. It also has a home heating and air conditioning division.
