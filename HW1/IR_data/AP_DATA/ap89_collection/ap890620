   A twin-engine airplane en route from North Carolina to the
Bahamas crashed in rainy weather Tuesday, killing four people, and
three others died when a small plane crashed in the rugged White
Cloud Mountains in Idaho.
   The Beechcraft Duke en route to the Bahamas crashed about 5 p.m.
near Interstate 26 on the 2,300-acre site of the Carolina Eastman
Kodak plant in central South Carolina, said Sharon Kelly, a
spokeswoman for the Lexington County Fire Department.
   ``Everything was routine,'' said Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman Roger Myers in Atlanta. ``All of a sudden, they lost radar
contact.''
   One body was found within an hour of the crash and rescue workers
found the other three bodies in the plane about 9 p.m., Ms. Kelly
said. The rescue workers waited for FAA investigators to arrive on
the scene before entering the wreckage.
   ``We had pieces of the plane scattered a quarter-mile away,'' she
said.
   The victims had not been identified late Tuesday, Ms. Kelly said.
   In Idaho, the twin-engine, six-seat Piper Aztec was en route to
Challis when it crashed in mid-afternoon. The flight had originated
in Alaska and stopped in Wenatchee, Wash., said William Miller,
chief of the Idaho Division of Aeronautics in Boise.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but snow, hail,
wind and rainstorms were reported in parts of central Idaho at the
time.
   The names of the victims were being withheld until relatives
could be notified.

   Actress Jane Fonda spent the night alone on
a mountain after becoming seperated from her companions while hiking
in Sequoia National Park, park officials said Tuesday.
   Fonda, who was unharmed, didn't panic when she realized she was
lost Sunday, said her publicist, Steve Rivers. She wrapped up in an
insulated blanket and ate a sandwich while she waited for help to
arrive, he said.
   Fonda hiked ahead of her six companions and apparently took a
wrong turn during the day hike, said Bill Tweed, a spokesman for the
park about 40 miles east of here.
   Her companions notified park officials when she failed to show up
at Moose Lake, their destination, or at their Pear Lake base camp,
Tweed said.
   A helicopter crew found Fonda on top of a mountain early Monday
morning, and reunited her with her friends at the base camp. The
group hiked out together, Tweed said.

<HEAD>Elections Set Off Alarms for the Thatcher Revolution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The alarms that have been sounding for months
turned to a clamor over the weekend, telling Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher that her revolution is in trouble.
   Strikes, inflation and interest rates _ the economic diseases
Mrs. Thatcher has fought for 10 years to eradicate _ are haunting
Britain again, and now comes a trouncing for her Conservative Party
in European Parliament elections.
   The government, while admitting its dismay, insists this doesn't
mean the end for Mrs. Thatcher's free-market crusade. It says voters
always use elections to the European Parliament to register protest
against governments in midterm, and that the turnout of 36 percent
is too low to shape lasting judgments.
   Nonetheless, the opposition Labor Party is jubilant, having won
its first national election victory since 1974. Labor has emerged
with 45 of the 78 mainland British constituencies and the Tories 32,
fully overturning the 45-32 advantage the Tories held in the 1984
Euro-election.
   Labor, having revamped some of its more stridently left-wing
policies to broaden its appeal, has ``been making steady progress
since early this year,'' said the party's foreign policy chief,
Gerald Kaufman.
   ``I like the pace of it _ don't want to go too fast, don't want a
surge that can fall again'' before before Britain's next election
which must be held by June 1992, he said.
   On Thursday, Labor won both seats in two special elections for
vacancies in the House of Commons _ in London and in Glasgow,
Scotland.
   Conservatives called both districts ``safe'' Labor seats that the
party should have won. In the Vauxhall district of London, Labor's
Kate Hoey increased the party's majority. In Glasgow Central, Labor
halted a challenge by the Scottish National Party, and its candidate
Mike Wilson won with a reduced but respectable majority.
   Former Prime Minister Edward Heath, an outspoken Thatcher foe in
the Conservative Party, believed she was in serious trouble, saying:
   ``If after 10 years of government you've still got nearly 2
million unemployed, you've got an overall deficit on your trade and
other dealings of 15 billion pounds ($23 billion), you've got
interest rates up to 14 percent and you've got inflation up to 8.3
percent and rising, then people are bound to say ... is this really
what we want?''
   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson said: ``We recognize all those
things. We agree that inflation is a great curse. We're tackling it,
and one isn't popular while one is serving up the medicine.''
   The inflation is widely ascribed to Thatcherism's own success in
reviving the economy through tax cuts, deregulation, selling
nationalized industries, abolishing foreign currency controls and
curbing trade union rights.
   The result has been a national spending spree, a sharp increase
in the trade deficit, bigger wage demands and higher interest rates.
   The unrest triggered by rising wage demands has raised the number
of worker days lost to strikes from 38,000 in December to 82,000 in
April. Wage increases are running at 9.3 percent, compared with 7.5
percent two years ago. On Wednesday, Britain faces its first
national rail strike since 1982.
   A wage-inflation spiral would be a nightmare for any government.
But even more trouble awaits Mrs. Thatcher over her plans to shake
up the legal, teaching and health services, her widely unpopular
property tax reform and her insistence on privatizing the national
water and electricity industries.
   Voters may also have been put off by her combative stance toward
the European Economic Community, which she has portrayed as a
bureaucracy bent on forcing socialism down the British throat.
   ``I think the general public are fed up with Euro-bashing,'' said
Heath.
   Despite Thatcherism's difficulties, no neutral observer is ready
to write her off. Mrs. Thatcher has hit low patches before, her
supporters say, yet she remains the only British prime minister in
more than 160 years to win three consecutive elections.
   Strikes may be recurring, but the number of days lost is nothing
near the 30 million in the last year before she ousted Labor in
1979. Inflation has yet to approach the double-digit permanency of
the years immediately before Mrs. Thatcher's ascent.
   Many voters seem to feel that having spent 10 years tackling
Britain's real problems, she is now attacking non-existent demons.
On issues like health and water a widespread feeling prevails of
``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
   Simon Jenkins, writing in the pro-Thatcher Sunday Times, said the
Euro-vote, and the surprising 15 percent share of the vote won by
the environmentalist Green Party, reflected a yearning for a
community spirit that has suffered in the hardheaded enterprise
culture favored by Mrs. Thatcher.
   Everywhere, he said, voters were distressed by what they perceive
as a deregulating spirit gone too far _ from the government's
refusal to impose dog licenses to combat a wave of dog attacks, to
the ease with which entrepreneurs can knock down historic buildings
and put up bland office blocks.
   Mrs. Thatcher, he concluded, ``must reconstruct late-Thatcherism
and must do so urgently.''

<TEXT>
   About 3,000 people cheered and surged
onto the road outside the Ondangwa refugee camp when buses carrying
170 returning exiles finally arrived.
   Most wore the red, blue and green colors of SWAPO, the South-West
Africa People's Organization, which fought for 23 years to win
Namibia's independence from South Africa. In the rush to welcome the
new arrivals, few noticed a South African army truck convoy passing
at that moment, its drivers grim-faced as they threaded their way
toward home.
   The scene last week symbolizes the changes taking place in
Ovamboland, Namibia's populous northern tier, as the territory tries
to put a 23-year bush war behind it and move toward peace and
independence.
   The situation, say local residents and frequent visitors, has
changed swiftly and dramatically since South Africa agreed in
December to a plan under which it will give up Africa's last colony,
which it has held for 74 years. The deal also provides for
U.N.-supervised elections to set up a new government.
   Despite a flare-up of border fighting that stalled the plan in
April, the South African military presence, which once numbered
50,000 troops, has been steadily cut to about 15,000, with more
leaving daily.
   At the main military base in Oshakati, once known as ``White
City,'' scores of houses now stand empty, and the only South African
soldiers in evidence at the base are paratroopers manning the gate.
U.N. officers occupy the former headquarters buildings.
   By road and rail, scores of armored vehicles used in the
guerrilla war are being sent back to South Africa. Others, still
caked with mud from jungle patrols, line base parking lots.
   Among those requisitioned by U.N. officials for use by their own
forces are at least 10 Casspirs vehicles. In the hands of the hated
Koevet (Crowbar) anti-insurgency police, the hulking vehicles came
to symbolize the harsh South African law enforcement polices.
   Repainted white with big ``U.N.'' letters on the side, the
Casspirs will be used by the U.N. police monitors, whose job is to
watch and handle complaints about the conduct of the South-West
African Police, of which Koevoet is now a part.
   The most stunning change, say some residents and visitors, is the
sudden and omnipresent visibility of SWAPO after years of government
suppression.
   The nationalist movement, considered likely to win a majority in
the elections scheduled for November, draws its largest support in
this region of bushland, farms and scattered settlements, home to
nearly half of Namibia's 1.4 million people.
   Although the internal political wing of SWAPO could legally
operate while the guerrilla unit was outlawed, this popular support
remained largely hidden in the years of warfare. Even displaying the
SWAPO flag often brought harassment and brutal South African
treatment.
   Now the flag flutters openly from homes, roadside liquor stores
and garages, even atop a concrete water tower near the Angolan
border where, until a few weeks ago, South African soldiers manned
machine guns.
   The exiles, said by the United Nations to number 41,000, are
returning to Namibia aboard U.N.-chartered flights from neighboring
countries to register for the November vote, the first step toward
setting up an independent government.
   Some observers say they have been surprised by the speed of the
South African withdrawal and by the lack of visible bitterness on
the part of the departing forces.
   However, a barely concealed resentment remains among many white
residents of northern Namibia about what is taking place _
especially the demonstrations in support of SWAPO, which many
believe is determined to impose a Marxist regime if it wins the
two-thirds majority needed to control the new government in the
November elections.
   ``Are you going to write the truth about this (mess-up)?'' one
German-speaking resident asked a journalist at the base guest house.
   Reports persist in the community that the Koevoet, although
officially integrated into the regular police, still holds several
SWAPO guerrillas as prisoners and continues to intimidate and
brutalize SWAPO supporters in the countryside.
   Peter Fitzgerald, a Dublin police superintendent who commands the
U.N. police monitoring contingent, said he had been unable to pin
down ``rumors'' about prisoners.

   While Soviet citizens openly take their
leaders to task and Poles vote in free elections, Vietnam's
Communists fire an editor who prints a short story about the human
failings of an 18th century emperor.
   Vietnam, the communist world's third most populous nation with
about 52 million people, has set definite limits on free expression
and political change while moving to liberalize its economy.
   The list of taboos ranges from public criticism of top leaders
and key policies to portraying the late revolutionary leader Ho Chi
Minh in anything but a heroic light.
   In a recent interview, Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Nguyen
Co Thach said a multiparty system is out of the question in Vietnam
and said current economic reforms will prevent pro-democracy
uprisings like the one in China.
   ``We advocate broadening democracy and reaching a consensus
through debate, but we do not tolerate pluralism,'' party chief
Nguyen Van Linh said in a speech in March.
   Linh and Thach are key architects of ``doi moi,'' or renovation,
Vietnam's version of Soviet glasnost and perestroika. Doi moi
flowered after Linh's rise to power in late 1986, especially in
southern Vietnam, where resentment of Marxist rule is sharp and
widespread.
   Journalists began to report on corruption and incompetence, and
their exposes got some high-level officials fired. Books and
magazines proliferated, some challenging the tolerance of the
political system, others offering once forbidden sexual fare.
   But about six months ago, a backlash took shape. Either reformist
leaders were trying to placate hard-liners, or the old guard simply
felt things had gone too far.
   Western analysts say that, rather than take the broader Soviet
road, the Vietnamese have opted for China's ``give the people videos
but no votes'' approach.
   But unlike in China, advocates of democracy have been mostly
confined to debate rather than street action. Many have seized upon
the firing of magazine editor Nguyen Ngoc last December as a cause
celebre.
   The editor of the relatively radical and popular Literature and
Art was pressured to quit after publishing several short stories by
a controversial writer, Nguyen Huy Thiep. One depicted Emperor Quang
Trung, a national hero who routed the Chinese two centuries ago, as
a man of common foibles and frailties.
   Nguyen Dinh Thi, secretary of the Writer's Association, said
controversy within the 450-member organization has been ``so fierce
that people forgot politeness.''
   Lai Nguyen An, a prominent literary critic, described Ngoc's
dismissal as a move by conservatives to deter doi moi.
   ``Skeptical books about our party, socialism are not allowed.
Those who tarnish national figures will be severely criticized,'' he
said in an interview.
   Nonetheless, changes have been substantial.
   More than a decade ago, political prisoners abounded, teen-agers
wearing jeans were suspect, and foreign journalists were escorted to
meet what some Vietnamese disdainfully call ``ornamental
intellectuals,'' or government mouthpieces.
   Thach said recently that 94,000 inmates of re-education camps had
been released over the past 10 years and only 120 political
prisoners remained.
   Relations between state and religious groups have improved.
   In February, the government allowed a group of prominent
academics critical of education standards to open Vietnam's first
private university, Thang Long University.
   In the arts, one recent film, ``The Woman of the River,''
contrasts a decent ex-official of the fallen Saigon government with
a Communist revolutionary who turns to corruption after the war.
   Although an anti-war novel has yet to appear, the experiences of
the Vietnam War and other conflicts are handled with more human
feeling in some recent fiction.
   Le Huu's forthcoming novel, ``The Humorless Colonel,'' tells of a
young officer who dies in Cambodia because of his father's unbending
military attitudes. In the past, war novels invariably depicted
cardboard characters going cheerfully to their deaths for the
Communist cause.
   While more strident voices are heard in the south, artists and
intellectuls in the north do not appear intent on hurtling doi moi
forward or dismantling the socialist state.
   ``Writers and artists must be given more freedom but liberty
doesn't mean destroying all gains of the past,'' Huu said. ``Writers
should not be disruptive.''
   Western diplomats also point out that while many students are
disgruntled, an organized, pro-democracy movement among them does
not appear to exist. Neither has an institution like the Catholic
Church in Poland emerged around which opponents to the existing
order could rally.
   Said one envoy in the Vietnamese capital: ``I don't want to make
any predictions, but I don't think the Communist Party here will be
challenged in the streets for several years as in China.''

   The agency, monitored in Nicosia on Monday, quoted Housing

   Kazeroni was quoted as telling the daily newspaper Ettela'at that
cheaper homes should be built that would consume less energy.

million and is growing at the rate of 2.5 million annually.

<DATELINE>PILA, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took a free-spending entrepreneur to
deprive Solidarity of a clean sweep of the East bloc's first freely
elected legislative chamber. A Communist-backed businessman.
   Henryk Stoklosa, who has made millions processing dead animals,
edged out Piotr Baumgart, an activist of the independent farmers'
union Rural Solidarity, in Sunday's runoff, unofficial returns
showed Monday.
   Stoklosa had drawn the Communist coalition's biggest pre-election
crowd _ 50,000 people at Pila stadium for free sausages and beer and
a drawing with prizes including a tractor, a color television and a
videocassette recorder.
   Tickets for the drawing had been handed out free in the
province's myriad small agricultural villages beforehand.
   Stoklosa will be a minority of one in the new 100-member Senate
that is to convene next month along with the more powerful lower
house, or Sejm, which the ruling Communists dominate because
opposition candidates were only allowed to run for one-third of its
seats.
   A visit to Pila on Sunday gave some hint of Stoklosa's assets.
   On the streets of the 70,000-resident western provincial town _
unusually prosperous- and tidy-looking by Polish standards _
soldiers from nearby military bases strolled arm-in-arm with
girlfriends eating ice cream cones.
   Stoklosa's moustachioed face stared out at passers-by from
election posters plastered nearly everywhere, in store windows,
walls and road overpasses. There were also posters attacking
Baumgart as an interloper because he comes from Szczecin, about 90
miles away.
   A journalist for Solidarity's Election Gazette estimated Stoklosa
put 200 million zlotys ($235,000) into the campaign. It was believed
to be the most expensive political campaign ever launched for an
individual in postwar Poland.
   In the nearby town of Smilowo, where Stoklosa's Farmutil company
is headquartered, the polling station was doing a brisk business
Sunday in an apparent show of local pride in the town's favorite son.
   But Stoklosa himself was absent. Attending to business first, he
was at an international trade fair in Poznan.
   His Farmutil company, located on 345 acres at the end of a
specially built road in Smilowo, gives a shiny neat appearance.
   But it belches an obnoxious odor over the rolling landscape, as
dead farm animals and meat plant scraps are boiled down into fats
and fodders for delivery by Stoklosa's truck fleet to customers
around Poland.
   An employee, speaking as flies buzzed around, said the stench
would disappear as soon as a new hermetically sealed processing
system is completed.
   The 210-worker plant has sprung up in the past seven years.
Stoklosa left his job as Pila tourism director and was kicked out of
the Communist Party during Solidarity's 1980-81 heyday for alleged
mismanagement.
   The plant now produces mainly fodder for animals, but plans are
for it to expand into poultry raising, fertilizer production and
slaughtering.
   The company makes an estimated 3 billion zlotys ($3.5 million)
annually and published reports say Stoklosa as a result can tool
around town in either one of two new Mercedes.
   ``He's got everything he could want in life, and now he wants
other people to have more too,'' said Henryk Mocho, a Stoklosa
campaign worker.
   ``He has very good organizing ability. He is the man who started
this whole enterprise from nothing, and now people can make a good
living here.''
   Marian Malecki of the Pila Solidarity Citizens Committee passed
Sunday afternoon quietly at the opposition's empty campaign office
with Leszek Woznicki, his former jailmate from 1982, the year
thousands of Solidarity activists spent time in jail after
authorities crushed their movement.
   They anticipated Stoklosa's win, but treated it philosophically.
   ``We are aware that Poland does not begin and end at Pila,''
Malecki said. No matter what the outcome, the local committee would
share in Solidarity's ``great success'' because it elected one other
Senate candidate and two members to the Sejm from the city, he said.
   Wozniaki, a Solidarity activist at the town's largest industry, a
light-bulb factory, said his forces were outgunned by Stoklosa's
massive poster campaign and Western-style gimmicks.
   He blamed a lack of money, paper and printing machines and
suggested Polish-Americans send more material aid to Solidarity next
time.
   ``Tell them that a free Poland depends on them too,'' he said,
only half-jokingly.

   The government has ordered a rotating

   Announcing the emergency measueres on Monday, Transport Minister

   That restriction will be enforced according to the last digit on

factories at a time.

   After an 11-year hiatus, pianist Van Cliburn
resumed his public performances Monday night to thunderous applause
with a concert dedicated to two late friends.
   The audience called the pianist back to the stage 13 times after
he completed his program of Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1 and
Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1. Cliburn ended the evening with
four encores.
   ``This is a very sentimental evening for me,'' Clibuurn told the
audience before the performance. ``This is an evening of remembrance
of two wonderful friends.''
   The pianist dedicated the concert at the open-air Mann Music
Center to Eugene Ormandy and Fredric R. Mann.
   Ormandy, who died in 1985, was music director of the Philadelphia
Orchestra for 44 years. Mann, a former U.S. ambassador, headed the
summer concert festival at the music center from 1949 until his
death in 1987.
   Cliburn played with Ormandy and the Philadelphia musicians within
weeks of gaining world fame for winning the first Tchaikovsky
International Competition in 1958. The relationship yielded numerous
concerts and recordings.
   He also played in Philadelphia in 1978, the year he quit
performed publicly, weary from a schedule that included 100 concerts
a year.
   He said he chose the Liszt to honor Ormandy's Hungarian
background. The program concluded with Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto
No. 1.
   Cliburn spent the morning practicing with the orchestra and the
afternoon shopping in Philadelphia.
   ``It's so good to be back with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It
seems like I never left,'' Cliburn said after the practice session.
   Among his favorite venues, Cliburn always listed Mann's theater
in Fairmont Park, where he would often play to the audience long
after the orchestra musicians had left for the night.
   Proceeds from Monday night's concert will help finance the
orchestra's free summer series, which Ormandy and Mann began.
   Roland Condon of Princess Anne, Md., who traveled with Cliburn
for six months two decades ago for a film project, said the years
dropped away from the pianist in profile.
   ``You would never know it has been 11 years since he appeared
before an audience like this,'' Condon said.
   Since 1978, he had performed in public only twice _ in December
1987 and in January 1988 for private gatherings honoring,
respectively, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the Bob Hope
Cultural Center.

<HEAD>`Ghostbusters Sequel Hot at Box Office</HEAD>

   ``Ghostbusters II'' zapped through a record by
collecting $29.4 million in its first three days as the summer of
'89 kept going like gangbusters at the nation's box offices.
   The Columbia Studios' film's $8.3 million on Sunday was the
biggest non-holiday Sunday ever, according to Exhibitor Relations
Inc., which tallies box-offce receipts.
   ``We are thrilled with the opening weekend's record breaking
results and we anticipate that `Ghostbusters II' will play very
strongly in the coming weeks,'' said Columbia's new chief, Dawn
Steel.
   The previous three-day record was set earlier this month by
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which earned $21.2 million
in its second week.
   It also easily topped Columbia's previous three-day record of
$13.6 million for ``Ghostbusters'' in June 1984.
   Since the debut of Bill Murray's and Dan Aykroyd's paranormal
investigators, Columbia has been spooked by several cinematic
clunkers, most recently ``True Believer,'' ``The Adventures of Baron
Munchausen'' and ``Physical Evidence.''
   The company's only hit in recent years was 1987's ``La Bamba.''
   The true test for `Ghostbusters II'' comes Friday, when it will
compete with the much-hyped ``Batman.''
   Steven Spielberg's ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' kept up
its charge, selling $11.7 million in tickets last weekend to claim
second place on the box-office charts. In just four weeks, it has
grossed more than $122 million.
   ``Dead Poets Society,'' the bittersweet prep school drama, earned
$9.1 million to pass ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' and move
into third place.
   ``Star Trek V,'' the first film directed by star William Shatner,
slipped badly from first to fourth place on sales of $7.1 million.
   In fifth was ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' with Richard Pryor
and Gene Wilder, with $2.5 million. The baseball movie ``Field of
Dreams,'' starring Kevin Costner, finished in sixth with $2.4
million. In seventh was the wrestling film ``No Holds Barred,'' with
$1.7 million.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``Road House,'' with $1.5 million,
``Pet Sematary'' with $1.2 million and ``K-9'' with $1 million.
   Since Memorial Day weekend, weekend box office revenues have
grossed $247.3 million, compared with $220 million for the period
last year, an increase of 11 percent, said John Krier of Exhibitor
Relations Inc., which tallies the box-office receipts.
   ``The gross isn't distributed quite the same,'' he said. ``Last
year there were more pictures playing and the gross was more evenly
distributed. This year the grosses are concentrated in the top two
or three movies.''
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of screens,
average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release.
   1. ``Ghostbusters II,'' Columbia, $29.4 million, 2,327 screens,
$12,229 per screen, $29.4 million, one week.
   2. ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' Paramount, $11.7
million, 2,327 screens, $5,039 per screen, $122.3 million, four
weeks.
   3. ``Dead Poets Society,'' Disney, $9.1 million, 1,091 screens,
$8,343 per screen, $22.4 million, three weeks.
   4. ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' Paramount, $7.1 million,
2,202 screens, $3,247 per screen, $31.2 million, two weeks.
   5. ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' Tri-Star, $2.5 million, 1686
screens, $1512 per screen, $38 million, six weeks.
   6. ``Field of Dreams,'' Universal, $2.4 million, 1,077 screens,
$2,265 per screen, $44.2 million, nine weeks.
   7. ``No Holds Barred,'' New Line, $1.6 million, 1,327 screens,
$1,339 per screen, $12 million, three weeks.
   8. ``Road House,'' MGM-UA, $1.5 million, 1,435 screens, $1,069
per screen, $23.8 million, five weeks.
   9. ``Pet Sematary,'' Paramount, $1.2 million, 923 screens, $1,365
per screen, $52.7 million, nine weeks.
   10. ``K-9,'' Universal, $1 million, 970 screens, $1,055 per
screen, $36.7 million, eight weeks.

<HEAD>Mountain Goat Herd to be Returned to Mount Juneau</HEAD>

   After years of absence, mountain goats will
be returned to the steep slopes of Mount Juneau with the help of
tranquilizers, helicopters and thousands of dollars in donations.
   Volunteers plan to relocate at least 10 wild goats from a remote
site south of Juneau or the Olympic Peninsula of Washington in late
summer or early fall.
   The goal is to restore a herd of goats that can be viewed by
residents and tourists in downtown Juneau, which sits in the narrow
valley between Mount Juneau and Mount Roberts.
   ``If all goes well, in a year or two or five we'll have a
population that will create splinter groups to proliferate in
valleys from Taku Inlet to Berners Bay,'' said project coordinator
Joel Bennett, a member of the state Fish and Game Board.
   ``Mount Juneau used to be goat habitat,'' Bennett said Monday.
``Goats were there quite commonly back in the mining days, the early
days of Juneau.''
   However, overhunting led to the goats' disappearance near the
Southeast Alaska city. Although goat hunting has been banned in the
area for several years, the goats have never returned.
   Since the Juneau Audubon Society began soliciting money for the
project in February, it has collected about $9,500 in money and
services _ enough to start the project, Bennett said.
   Bennett hopes to have $12,000 by the time the relocation begins,
and said he has been encouraged by the public response. Donations
have included helicopter time from a local charter outfit, a $1,000
check and $30 worth of quarters that a little girl collected in a
bag.
   If the goats cannot be captured south of Juneau near Whiting
River, the volunteers will turn to the Olympic Peninsula where the
goat population has become a nuisance.
   ``We actally gave the goats to the Olympic Peninsula in the first
place. We would be getting the same stock back,'' Bennett said.
   State wildlife officials will tranquilize the goats, which will
be transported to the mountain by helicopters. Officials hope to get
at least three males and seven females to ensure that the population
grows.
   Radio collars will be put on some of the goats so their movement
can be monitored.

   In the belief that these are vinegar's salad
days, a bus driver has brought out a book entirely on the
centuries-old food seasoning.
   ``Vinegar is something more than just to put in your salad,''
Lawrence J. Diggs said at a news conference Monday flanked by
various vinegars. One displayed was the gourmet's balsamic, which
can cost up to $30 for a few ounces.
   Diggs believes his 259-page book ``Vinegar'' is the most complete
ever written on the subject.
   Vinegar, from the French word for ``sour wine,'' is the end
product of fermentation. Anything that can be fermented into alcohol
_ including fruits, grains, orange juice, molasses, honey _ can be
made into vinegar.
   The tome covers vinegar's history, commercial production, how to
make it at home, and medicinal uses.
   ``To remove a freckle, apply vinegar,'' the author prescribes.
Soda mixed with vinegar will deal with heartburn, while hay fever
can be combated by inhaling horseradish and vinegar several times a
day.
   Diggs even has a chapter on vinegar trivia. ``If one dreams about
vinegar, it signifies jealousy or a quarrel,'' he advises, and
``Never give vinegar away or your luck will go with it.''
   The author, a Zen Buddhist, said he planned to use profits from
the $24.95 book to establish a monastic hermitage. He also expressed
gratitude to San Francisco's Municipal Railway for helping make his
book possible.
   ``I wrote a lot of the book on the bus,'' he confided.

   Summer is coming to central Idaho's Camas
Prairie, and Harold Stroud once again has his eye on Soldier
Mountain's last patch of snow _ and on his friends Bill Stewart and
Wes Fields.
   As they have for more than a decade, the three have placed bets
on when the final remnant of winter will disappear. With dinner for
the winner at stake, it's a bet that nature has not always been
allowed to settle.
   Stroud is betting again that the snow will still being visible on
Aug. 10, but he knows a lot can happen by then.
   Faced with losing several years ago when the snow was nearly gone
days before his target date, Stroud sent his two sons up the
mountain to stretch white sheets on the ground. Sheets can look a
lot like snow from 10 miles away, but someone picked them up early
and Stroud lost.
   Another year, Stroud was ready to collect a free meal because a
tiny patch of snow was visible the afternoon before the day of
reckoning. But the next day, the mountain looked bare. As it turned
out, Stewart had driven into the high country with Fields to shovel
dirt over the snow patch.
   Winning that bet cost them about $500, but as Fields said,
``Winning is the thing, you see.''

<HEAD>NLRB, Supreme Court Issue Major Rulings On Drug Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's private employers now have
expanded authority to require drug tests of job applicants, while
railroads and airlines have greater power to test those already on
the job.
   The National Labor Relations Board says private employers may
decide unilaterally to require drug testing of job applicants,
although they still must negotiate with unions if they want to test
their employees,
   The board's decision came Monday, the same day the Supreme Court
ruled in a more narrowly defined case that railroads may require
tests for workers without first bargaining with unions.
   The decisions regarding existing workers appeared at odds, but
they involved two separate labor laws, the Railway Labor Act that
applies only to rail and airline workers, and the National Labor
Relations Act which governs other labor contracts.
   The court case, a victory for Conrail, followed earlier rulings
in which railroads and airlines won the right to test workers for
drug and alcohol use, principally on grounds of concern for public
safety.
   The NLRB case covers far more industries. One attorney involved
with the NLRB decision said he expected it to lead to a
proliferation of job applicant testing requirements.
   ``People who had been taking a sit-back-and-wait approach may now
go ahead'' with pre-employment screening, said John Dennison, vice
president for labor relations for the Star Tribune newspaper of
Minneapolis. ``There's been a lot of interest. We've had a lot of
inquiries.''
   Labor Department figures show that about 11.05 million union
members worked in the private sector last year, along with 1.1
million workers who are not members of unions but whose jobs are
covered by union contracts.
   A department study released in January said that just 3 percent
of the nation's private-sector employers had drug-testing programs,
although 43 percent of businesses with 1,000 or more workers had
testing programs.
   The Newspaper Guild had challenged the Star Tribune's policy of
testing job applicants for drug and alcohol use without first
seeking to negotiate such a policy with the union.
   An administrative law judge sided with the Guild in 1987, but the
NLRB overturned the part of the judge's decision relating to
pre-employment testing.
   Since applicants for union-represented jobs at the newspaper were
not yet members of the union, ``We find that drug and alcohol
testing of applicants for employment is not a mandatory subject of
bargaining,'' the board said.
   It did, however, uphold a portion of the judge's decision
requiring the newspaper to provide the union with the names and
addresses of applicants who were offered jobs but did not take them,
including those who refused to submit to testing.
   The board said the Guild was entitled to the information to
monitor Star Tribune hiring practices for any signs of
discrimination.
   The union, as part of its challenge of the policy, said male
applicants were allowed to provide urine samples without being
observed, while female applicants were required to give the samples
partially unclothed and in the presence of a nurse.
   The Supreme Court case involved Conrail's 1987 decision to check
for drugs as part of a urinalysis administered to workers
periodically and when they return to work after absences. The tests
were adopted in 1976 but prior to 1987 were used only to check for
health problems such as diabetes.
   Railway unions said adding the drug test was a ``major''
labor-management dispute under the federal Railway Labor Act, and
therefore was a bargaining issue. Minor disputes may be settled by
the railroad without negotiations with the union, although any
decision is subject to arbitration.
   ``Conrail's well-established recognition of the relevance of drug
use to medical fitness substantially weakens the union's claim that
Conrail now, for the first time, is engaging in medical testing that
reveals facts about employees' private off-duty conduct,'' Justice
Harry A. Blackmun said in writing for the court.
   Lawrence Mann, a lawyer who represented the railroad unions, said
he hopes Congress will act to protect workers' rights by assuring
drug tests are reliable and accurate.
   In another drug-testing case, the NLRB ruled Monday that a
California company violated labor law when it decided in 1986 to
require all employees who were injured on the job and required
treatment to submit to tests.
   The Johnson Bateman Co., a manufacturer of concrete pipes,
contended that a ``management rights'' clause in its contract with
the Machinists union allowed it to implement the policy.
   But the board, siding with the union, said there was no evidence
that drug testing was among the issues covered by the clause, which
allowed the company to make certain work rule changes.
   ``The instant drug-alcohol testing requirement is a mandatory
subject of bargaining,'' the board said.
   Company officials were not available for comment Monday,
according to a receptionist in their office, and the company's
lawyer also was not at his office Monday afternoon.

<HEAD>Congress Should Protect Workers' Rights in Drug-Testing, Lawyer Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Congress should step in to protect the privacy
rights of workers who face drug testing as the Supreme Court expands
some employers' authority to require such tests, a union lawyer says.
   Lawrence Mann, an attorney who represented railway workers in a
case the high court decided Monday, said he hopes Congress will help
workers by assuring drug tests are reliable and accurate.
   ``That's really what labor is concerned about,'' he said.
   Mann said in the long run federal legislation could be more
significant than Monday's ruling in determining how drug tests will
be conducted.
   Donald Savelson, a New York City lawyer whose firm represents
airlines, said the ruling is unlikely to have much impact beyond the
railroad and airline industries.
   ``Collective bargaining will still be required'' before most
employers can adopt drug tests, he said.
   The justices, in their first decision focusing on drug testing in
private employment, ruled, 7-2, that railroads that already require
physical examinations for workers may require drug tests as well
without bargaining with unions over the issue.
   The court said Conrail _ the Consolidated Rail Corp. _ acted
legally when it unilaterally decided to use urinalysis tests to
check for drugs.
   The court based its ruling on an interpretation of the federal
Railway Labor Act. That law applies to airlines as well, but the
ruling may have limited impact for other industries covered by
separate federal legislation.
   The justices, in two key decisions last March, said workers in
sensitive government jobs or entrusted with public safety in
federally regulated work may be forced to undergo the tests.
   Conrail decided in 1987 to check for drugs as part of a
urinalysis administered to workers periodically and when they return
to work after absences.
   The tests were adopted originally when Conrail was formed in
1976. But their primary purpose before 1987 was to check for
physical fitness, not the presence of drugs. For example, the tests
would reveal whether an employee had diabetes or other health
problems.
   Railway labor unions said adding the drug-screening component is
a ``major'' labor-management dispute under the Railway Labor Act,
and therefore must be submitted to union-management negotiations.
   Minor disputes can be settled unilaterally by the railroad,
although any such decision by an employer is subject to arbitration.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said the
drug-screening change is minor because ``the action is arguably
justified by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining
agreement.''
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented.
   Monday's decision overturned a ruling by the Philadelphia-based
3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that barred Conrail from
conducting the tests without evidence that particular workers
engaged in drug abuse.
   The railroads said the need for drug testing is underscored by an
accident at Chase, Md., on Jan. 4 1987, in which an Amtrak passenger
train collided with Conrail locomotives, killing 16 and injuring
174. The Conrail engineer and brakeman later were found to have been
using marijuana.
   The railroads also cited studies that estimated 25 percent of
railroad workers drink alcohol on duty. The studies said between
1975 and 1985, alcohol and other drugs were responsible for 37
deaths, 80 injuries and $34 million in property damage.
   In other action, the court:
   _Refused to reinstate former Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel's 1977
mail-fraud conviction, thrown out five years after he completed a
prison term.
   _Refused to kill a nine-year-old lawsuit in which the Catawba
Indian Tribe claims ownership of 225 square miles of South Carolina.
   _Rejected an appeal by a California woman facing criminal charges
in an attempted faith-healing of her four-year-old daughter who died
of meningitis.
   _Struck down, by a 6-3 vote, a Connecticut law aimed at assuring
that beer sold in the state costs no more than it does in three
neighboring states.
   _Refused to hear an appeal by Margaret Randall, a professor and
writer threatened with deportation from the United States for
supporting communism.

   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III says a
cruise-missile engine agreement with a Michigan company will be
canceled even though the Navy found the deal led to lower prices.
   The Navy will cancel the agreement with Williams International of
Walled Lake, Mich., on grounds that it should not have committed the
service to future contracts, Garrett wrote last week to Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich.
   ``For each of the past 10 years, Williams has submitted
competitive prices well below those of its competitor for production
engines,'' Garrett wrote. ``We do believe that the fact of
competition has benefited the taxpayer by creating an added
incentive to lower prices.''
   He said Williams has exceeded its reliability goals and delivered
every engine ahead of the contract date.
   Williams in 1978 signed an agreement that would allow a
competitor, Teledyne Industries Inc., to use Williams' technology to
build cruise-missile engines for the Navy. In return, the Navy
guaranteed it would buy 240 engines a year from Williams, plus 25
percent of any additional purchases up to 1,200 engines annually.
   Garrett, in an April letter to Levin, had written that the
decade-old agreement with Williams was ``severely limiting our
contracting options and decisions, in a manner which we believe
inconsistent with sound procurement policy and the public interest.''
   Garrett also said in April that Teledyne's prices had become
``very competitive'' with Williams beginning last year.
   The April letter was made public by a whistle-blower group called
the Project on Military Procurement. Levin released last week's
letter.
   Garrett said the Navy's cancellation of the 1978 agreement ``in
no way implies criticism of Williams International's integrity or
performance.''
   ``We appreciate the emphasis on ethics that has always been part
of Williams International's management, and we consider it an
outstanding Navy contractor,'' Garrett wrote.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Bruce Cole said Monday he could not
immediately comment on the two letters.
   Levin said that even though the agreement was still being
canceled, ``There are some real differences'' between Garrett's
April letter and what he wrote last week. ``Maybe he recognizes that
his first letter was really not the most accurate reflection of the
situation.''

   The odds were heavily against Richard Gephardt
when he sought the White House. Now he's on another track, and the
odds are on his side. One day, the new leader of the House
Democratic majority can almost certainly become the 50th speaker of
the House.
   As his party's floor leader, he is in the job that has produced
the last 12 speakers. Rep. Thomas S. Foley's promotion from majority
leader to speaker two weeks ago opened the leadership spot for
Gephardt to win.
   It's not the White House, but it's not bad work.
   And of course, Gephardt's options are open.
   He's ruled out a presidential bid in 1992. But at 48 he's got
plenty of time to change political goals again. With a 258-175
majority over the Republicans _ in an era when incumbents seldom
lose _ the Democrats are likely to be electing speakers for quite a
while.
   Gephardt and Foley, who begins his speakership at 60, give the
Democrats a new-look team that blends the get-along skill of the
legislative insider with the political savvy of the national
campaigner. And Gephardt was known as an able congressional
politician before he tried to go national.
   Third man in the leadership is the new Democratic whip, Rep.
William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania. Gray, the first black to win a
top leadership post, proved able and adept as chairman of the House
Budget Committee where he held what had been a wavering Democratic
line against the lure of Reaganomics.
   Gephardt turned aside questions about his future presidential
ambitions by saying the voters made that call for him in 1988. But
he clearly had been planning another bid for the White House in 1992
until the swift and unforeseeable shakeup that opened his path to
the leadership.
   That came when Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the Democratic
whip, announced that he was resigning rather thn undergo an ethics
investigation into a 1986 junk bonds deal. He was in line to succeed
Foley as majority leader with the resignation of Speaker Jim Wright.
Coelho left the House on Thursday, his 47th birthday.
   A few weeks earlier, Gephardt had mused aloud about the personal
and financial demands of another bid for the presidential
nomination, saying he had not decided whether to take them on in
advance of 1992. He said he knew that would require him to get
started soon and he didn't like that idea.
   The question, he said then, was whether he could effectively
pursue his policy goals in Congress. Now, as majority leader, he
intends to.
   Gephardt said after winning the leader's job that he agreed with
Speaker Foley on the priority agenda, including ethics and campaign
reform. Then he turned to the economic issues that were the themes
of his 1988 campaign.
   ``In my humble opinion, America is beginning to be in a state of
decline,'' said Gephardt, who pressed issues of trade and
productivity during his presidential run. ``And we as Democrats have
to lead ... Even though the presidency is held by a different party,
and even though getting our consensus together on the Democratic
side is always difficult to do.''
   Gephardt entered the Democratic presidential field as an early
advocate of tax reform and a champion of protectionist trade
legislation. ``It's your fight, too,'' was his message to the voters.
   The seasoning he gained and the scrutiny he faced as a
presidential candidate will serve Gephardt well in his new role.
Like Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, who ran twice for the White
House, he knows the techniques of national politics better than
colleagues who have done all their campaigning in home districts or
congressional cloakrooms.
   Both he and Dole won the Iowa caucuses, the leadoff events of the
1988 campaign, then foundered and were finished by the March 8 Super
Tuesday primaries. Gephardt quit in time to file for reelection to
the House from his St. Louis district, saying he'd done his best,
made his mistakes and had no complaints or alibis.
   Gephardt faced sharp challenges in 1988 campaign debates for
changing his positions over the years on such issues as a
constitutional amendment to ban abortion, on school busing, on
Reaganomics. He said change was evidence of growth, of seeking
better ways to do things. That explanation plays better in the
congressional world of compromise and consensus than in the
presidential campaign arena.
   Now he's tried both, and says he is not going to use the House
leadership as a stepping stone to anything else. ``You can't be an
effective majority leader and be running for president,'' he said.
   As for the odds:
   The last sitting House member to vault directly to the White
House was Rep. James A. Garfield, in 1880.
   Not since 1919 has the House majority elected a speaker who did
not serve first as his party's floor leader.

   Wind erosion over the winter inflicted its
worst damage in three decades on the Great Plains, ripping away
topsoil over 14.3 million acres, the Agriculture Department says.
   ``The big reason for the increase is the drought,'' soil
conservation service chief Wilson Scaling said Monday. ``Not only
was it dry but it meant we went into the wind erosion season with
inadequate vegetative cover and little residue to protect the soil
from blowing.''
   He said the last time the May-November wind erosion season
wrought so much damage on the Great Plains was when 15 million acres
were damaged in 1954-55, when the department first began to keep
such records.
   In the worst day of the season, winds of up to 80 miles an hour
swooped through on Kansas on March 14, damaging 4.8 million acres.
   Kansas was the hardest hit state, with more than 5 million acres
damaged. It was a record for the state. North Dakota was second with
2.3 million acres harmed and Texas followed with almost 2 million
acres damaged.
   More than 90 percent of the damage is on lands being used for
crops. The rest is on rangeland.
   Wind erosion damage last year uprooted soil from some 12 million
acres.
   The department said farmers used emergency tillage on 3 million
acres, a system under which topsoil with sufficient moiture is
roughened to prevent blowing. More than half of the emergency
tillage was in Texas.
   Here is a list of the amount of acres damaged in each Great
Plains state:
   Montana 1,832,000; Nebraska 191,600; North Dakota 2,297,700;
South Dakota 678,600; Wyoming 552,700; Colorado 1,403,700; Kansas
5,126,300; New Mexico 118,000; Oklahoma 111,900; Texas 1,979,600.

   Wheat production in the United States and
Europe should fall slightly below previous estimates for the next
year, suggesting supplies already reduced by last year's drought
will remain tight, the USDA says.
   With world stocks already at their lowest in more than a decade,
prices could be somewhat skittish in the crop year that began June
1, responding sharply to changes in growing conditions and import
demand, the department said.
   A drop of $10 a ton in the price of U.S. wheat in recent weeks
represents an example of this sensitivity, the Agriculture
Department said in its monthly World Grain Situation and Outlook
report.
   Despite such fluctuations, however, prices should remain strong
on the whole, the department said. It said the overall strength in
prices combined with an improvement in crop prospects in some of the
traditional importing countries is expected to reduce world demand
from the level of a year earlier.
   The USDA said the major change will come in the Soviet Union,
where wheat imports are expected to decline by around 20 percent to
12 million tons.
   Estimated exports by the European Community remain the same as
previously, but the forecast of production has been lowered to
reflect a smaller than expected crop of durum, the wheat used for
pasta. The report said that might mean increased EC imports of North
American durum and might even trigger a cutback in Italian semolina
exports to North Africa.
   The European Community estimate was for 77.8 million metric tons,
down from 78.5 million last month.
   The estimate of U.S. production was 55.2 million, down from 55.8
million in last month's report.

   Parrot lovers and other buyers of exotic birds
are getting a stern warning from the Department of Agriculture to
make certain their pets meet federal import requirements.
   The warning has been brought on by an outbreak of exotic
Newcastle disease among 17 Amazon parrots, sun cockatoos and other
birds owned by a Connecticut collector. Seven of the parrots were
purchased from a Houston dealer on May 19 and became ill. They and
12 other birds were dead by June 14.
   Meanwhile, the collector had sold some of the birds to five pet
stores and a number of individual purchasers.
   The birds were tested by the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, operated by USDA's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service. They were found to have exotic Newcastle
disease.
   To prevent further spread of the disease, the collector's 60
remaining birds were destroyed, the department said. It said it will
pay the collector more than $45,000 in indemnities for the
destruction of his collection.
   Exotic Newcastle disease is a virus that is deadly to all birds
and could be a major problem for the commercial poultry industry,
although no commercial flocks have been infected yet.
   Larry B. Slagle, acting director of the inspection service, said
smuggled birds enter the United States by the hundreds following the
winter breeding season and often carry exotic Newcastle disease
without showing symptoms.
   He said exotic birds imported into the United States must be
declared to federal inspectors, carry appropriate permits and enter
a mimimum 30-day quarantine. The Agriculture Department tests them
for disease during that time.

<HEAD>Bush Draws Lesson for US Students From Chinese Events</HEAD>

   President Bush, drawing a lesson for America's
youth from the struggles of China's students in Tiananmen Square, is
urging young people to devote their lives to democratic ideals and
community service.
   Bush was honoring 121 of the nation's top high school seniors,
the 1989 Presidential Scholars, at the White House today, after
making a quick journey by helicopter Monday evening to deliver a
commencement address at Cheltenham High School in Wyncote, Pa.
   There, in a steamy gymnasium packed with 2,500 people, he
delivered a message intended for all 2.5 million seniors graduating
from high school this June, not just Cheltenham's 331.
   ``We do not have to stand in front of tanks in America, thank
God. But we do have to summon the same courage to confront the evil
that exists in the world,'' said Bush.
   He told the Cheltenham graduates they were the heirs to a legacy
of American sacrifice, from Bunker Hill to Bastogne, ``where we
upheld the tenets of democracy,'' and from the Red Cross to the
Peace Corps.
   ``Today I ask you to take a risk for a cause larger than
ourselves,'' he said. ``It is the cause of helping others and
thereby America. It is the cause of democratic ideals.''
   He said brave people are struggling in the Soviet Union, Poland
and China for basic human rights and freedoms that ``our ancesors
secured for us _ and that we too often take for granted.''
   Recalling the solitary young man who briefly stopped a column of
tanks in Beijing on June 5, Bush said, ``That vivid, unforgettable
image illustrates how precious is the freedom that is America's
secret weapon and her shield.''
   He called volunteerism and community service ``central to our
fabric as a nation, and as a people. No, they aren't as dramatic as
the profiles in courage of Warsaw, the gulags and Tiananmen Square.
   ``But they reflect the same sense of sacrifice and of concern ...
for country, decency, our fellow man,'' he said.
   Bush plans to keep the spotlight on youth and altruism on
Wednesday at the White House when he announces details of the ``YES
to America Initiative.'' The acronym stands for Youth Entering
Service.
   ``We will refute those who speak of a `me' generation. Instead
this program can build a cathedral of the spirit, and help yours
become a global `we' generation,'' he told the seniors.
   Bush has previously announced plans to ask Congress to invest
$100 million over four years into a YES Foundation to encourage
young people to perform community service. He will head the
foundation.
   Bush was introduced at Cheltenham by Hang Nguyen, a senior
graduating with top honors who came to this country as a refugee
from her native Vietnam in 1975. Her mother still lives there.
   ``Each of us has come to this moment in a different way,'' she
said. ``Our commencement is both a common achievement and a unique
one. In some ways these ceremonies are like thousands of others
being held across the nation.''
   But, she added, they were also ``unique because of this class ...
this school ... this community'' _ and the commencement speaker.
   The 330 Cheltenham seniors had to yield some graduation tickets
and curtail their own speeches to make room for the president and
his entourage.
   ``Half of us were excited,'' said Jason Gorman. ``But there were
those who thought it is more important for more of the relatives to
come than the president.''
   But another senior, Adam Cherry, said, ``It's the greatest thing
that could happen to a senior class.''
   Each graduate got a handshake from Bush, and many of the girls
stole a kiss as well. The graduates wore blue and gold robes, and
Bush was in academic garb himself.
   Cheltenham's alumni include baseball star Reggie Jackson; Robert
Meyers, an architect of the Social Security system, and Dr. Michael
Brown, a Nobel Prize winner for medicine.

<HEAD>Study Finds Black Men Have Faster Heart Rates Than White Men Under
Exercise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black men experience a faster heartbeat at
moderate exercise than do their white counterparts, a finding that
may account for the greater incidence of high blood pressure and
heart disease among blacks, according to a North Carolina researcher.
   Dr. Lars G. Ekelund, an associate professor of medicine at the
University of North Carolina, said an analysis of treadmill stress
tests conducted as part of a national study showed black men tended
to have about eight more heartbeats a minute than white men at the
same levels of exercise.
   ``We found a difference that was highly significant,'' said
Ekelund in an interview Monday. ``If you take those eight beats, it
corresponds to about a 30 percent increase in risk for coronary
heart disease.''
   The increased heartbeat rate during exercise could also explain
why blacks tend to have more hypertension, or high blood pressure,
and more strokes than whites, he said. Resting pulse rates, taken
before the exercise, showed no significant difference between the
races.
   Ekelund said a weakness in the study is that only 83 black men
participated while 2,548 white men were counted. A much larger study
is needed, he said, to confirm the data.
   Ekelund said the pulse rates probably are a fundamental genetic
difference between the races in their response to exercise. This
difference, he said, may be important when evaluating the cardiac
health of a black male. Higher heartbeat rates usually suggest a
person is less fit, but for a black male the higher rate may be
normal.
   ``It suggests we should apply different norms for black males
compared to whites,'' said Ekelund. If the same norms are used for a
black person as for a white person, he said, the difference in
heartbeat rate would make a black man appear less fit than he
actually is.
   The study is based on data collected from men between the 20 and
69. None of the test subjects had detectable heart disease when the
tests were administered. The data was adjusted, said Ekelund, for
differences in age, weight and other factors which can affect
individual heart rates.
   Ekelund said the research agrees with an earlier study that
monitored the blood pressure of boys while they played stressful
video games. That study showed black youths tended to have higher
blood pressure in response to the excitement of the game.
   ``This suggests that blacks may inherit an increased response to
stress which may explain their higher prevalence of hypertension,''
he said.
   The data used in the study was collected by the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute as part of a national research effort by 10
clinics. A massive amount of data was collected in the 1970s and is
still being analyzed.
   Ekelund presented the research finding Monday at the Second
International Conference on Preventive Cardiology.

<HEAD>Heart Disease Death Rates Declining In West, Up in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

   Heart disease death rates have been retreating
for almost three decades in Western industrialized countries and
experts at an international conference say they still don't know why.
   ``There is one less coronary (heart attack) every minute in this
country,'' said Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute. ``We have witnessed a significant decrease
in heart disease. But the cause of this decline is not clear.''
   Lenfant said the decline in heart attacks in the United States
started in the 1960s, when the rate of death from cardiac disease
was more than 400 per 100,000 persons. The rate is dropping at a
steady annual rate and now is about 330 per 100,000 persons.
   ``It keeps going down and there is no sign of its leveling off,''
Lenfant told reporters Monday at the 2nd International Conference on
Preventive Cardiology.
   He said the reasons could be a reduction in smoking, better
diets, more exercise or better treatment. But it would take a large,
comprehensive study to pinpoint the exact reason for the change.
   ``The decline in the U.S. (of heart disease deaths) is
extraordinary,'' said Dr. William T. Friedewald, associate director
for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health. ``But
the U.S. still has one of the highest rates in the world.''
   Japan, which already has one of the lowest rates of cardiac
disease in the world, is also experiencing a decline in death rates.
   Dr. Hirotsugu Ueshima, a researcher at the National
Cardiovascular Center in Osaka, Japan, said that in 1970 there were
120 cardiac disease deaths annually per 100,000 persons over age 60
in Japan. That rate now has dropped to 100. For those age 50 to 59,
the rate has dropped from 60 per 100,000 in 1970 to 40 at present.
   ``It is still going down,'' said Ueshima.
   People in Japan, he said, are now eating more animal fat, thought
to be a risk factor in heart disease, but this has had no apparent
impact on rate of heart disease.
   ``Even though there is more meat (a source of animal fat) in the
diet, it is still lower than the American diet,'' he said. Japanese
get about 25 percent of their calories from fat, compared to about
38 percent in the American diet, he said.
   Healthier hearts, however, are not universal.
   A World Health Organization study released at the conference
shows deaths among men from heart disease rose steeply between 1970
and 1985 in nearly all of the East European countries where data is
available. The study included only industrialized countries and did
not include trend data from the Soviet Union.
   Bulgaria led the rate of reported increase with heart disease
death rates shooting up by 62 percent. By comparison, in the United
States during that same period, the rates declined by 36.5 percent.
   Even with the increase, however, Bulgaria still has a lower rate
of heart disease mortality for men, about 297 per 100,000 persons,
than the U.S., the report says.
   The male heart disease death rate in other countries included
increases of 30 percent in Greece; 36.9 percent in Poland; 42.8
percent in Yugoslavia; 19.5 percent in Hungary; 18.1 percent in
Romania, and 14.4 percent in East Germany.
   Deaths among men from heart disease declined throughout western
and northern Europe, and also in Australia, New Zealand, Canada,
Japan and Israel. An exception was Ireland, where the rate increased
by 0.8 percent.
   Except for Bulgaria, East Germany, Poland and Yugoslavia, heart
disease death rates declined for women in all of the reported
countries. The rates for women declined most remarkably in Israel
and Australia, both with drops of about 50 percent. In the United
States, the death rates for women dropped by 33.8 percent and stood
at 119 per 100,000.
   According to the report, the lowest rate of death due to heart
disease was among women in France, where the rate was 41 per
100,000. The highest was among men in Northern Ireland where the
rate was 438 per 100,000.

   Information on what hazardous chemicals are
being released from nearby industrial plants will soon be as close
as the home computer or a neighborhood library, says the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   The EPA unveiled its computerized database for toxic chemical
releases on Monday and said that in the coming months the
information _ which will be updated yearly _ will be available in
microfiche as well as computer disc and magnetic tape.
   The inventory of releases, which is based on information provided
the EPA by each company, also may be obtained through ToxNet, a
computer information system of the National Library of Medicine.
Access to ToxNet will cost $25 an hour and be accessible by home
computers 24 hours a day.
   A 1986 law, which took effect last year, requires industry to
supply information each year on what toxic chemicals are being
released from plants. The requirement covers 328 hazardous chemicals.
   It took the EPA nearly a year to develop the computer database,
but Charles Elkins, director of toxics at the agency, said the job
is likely to be easier and quicker next time around. Industry is
scheduled to submit its second round of data at the end of this
month, covering releases in 1988.
   The first set of data was submitted nearly a year ago, reflecting
releases in 1987.
   ``We have tried to make the computerized inventory as `user
friendly' as possible,'' said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly.
   The EPA database allows a person to focus on a single industrial
plant and learn what toxic releases into the air, water, or soil the
plant has reported to the EPA during the latest reporting year.
   The system includes a variety of indexes including type of
chemicals, names of plants, and locations of plants down to
counties, cities and postal zip codes, officials said.
   The EPA said the computerized database or microfiche will be made
available to more than 1,400 federal libraries and local public
libary systems so that at least one library in every county will
have the data available.
   In addition, the database on computer disc or magnetic tape will
be for sale through the Government Printing Office or the National
Technical Information System (NTIS).

<HEAD>Thornburgh Will Merge Strike Forces Into U.S. Attorneys' Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says his
decision to merge the Justice Department's organized crime strike
forces into U.S. attorneys' offices will eliminate confusion and
duplication in the current system.
   Thornburgh said Monday the 14 strike forces will be abolished and
organized crime units will be created in 23 U.S. attorneys' offices
around the country by Oct. 1.
   The plan, which the attorney general earlier said he was
considering, has drawn fire from some in Congress who contend it
would blunt an effective weapon against organized crime.
   Thornburgh, a former U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh, said in a
statement the changes ``are designed to ensure that the department's
resources are more comprehensively directed against organized
crime.''
   ``They will help reduce confusion and overlapping jurisdiction
among federal investigators and prosecutors as well as making more
resources available by shutting down duplicate offices,'' Thornburgh
said.
   Congressional hearings are planned on the issue, including one
scheduled today by the House Judiciary criminal justice subcommittee.
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., called Thornburgh's announcement
on the eve of the subcommittee's hearing ``sort of a slap in the
face to the many senators and representatives who asked him to wait
until we could really discuss this.''
   Schumer said the subcommittee he chairs has taken no position on
the issue but has heard good arguments both for keeping and for
abolishing the strike forces.
   If lawmakers determine Thornburgh made a wrong decision ``we will
consider introducing legislation to preserve the strike forces,'' he
said.
   The strike forces were conceived in the 1960s by then-Attorney
General Robert F. Kennedy.
   Since 1984, members of the top echelon of organized crime
families in Boston, Buffalo, N.Y.; Chicago, Kansas City, Cleveland,
Brooklyn and Philadelphia, were convicted as a result of strike
force prosecutions.
   The debate over the strike forces is not new. But it flared up
earlier this year when Thornburgh disclosed he was considered a plan
to abolish them.
   Several senators, including Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., and Sam Nunn, D-Ga., urged Thornburgh not to
abolish the strike forces.
   In an article published in Monday's editions of The New York
Times, Nunn and Kennedy argued that ``there is no justification for
such a step.''
   They suggested that Thornburgh was responding to the traditional
hostility to strike forces by U.S. attorneys who are protective of
their turf.
   ``Ending all strike forces to assuage U.S. attorneys' egos would
be a triumph of ideology over common sense and could destroy the
federal organized-crime program,'' the senators wrote.
   Thomas Puccio, a former Abscam prosecutor, said it would be ``a
mistake to abolish them.''
   ``You won't have a group that's permanently dedicated to
organized crime,'' said Puccio, a New York defense lawyer.
   ``You also develop a certain amount of professionalism and
although there are some outstanding U.S. attorneys, those selections
are still made politically to some degree,'' he said.
   Thornburgh said he would create an organized crime council within
the Justice Department to coordinate the fight against such criminal
activity.

<HEAD>Vietnamese to Return 28 Sets Of Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam will on Wednesday turn over the
remains of what it believes are 28 American servicemen missing from
the Vietnam War, a U.S. military spokesman said.
   Maj. Dan Trout said today that a U.S. military team is to fly to
Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, for a turn-over ceremony before the
remains are flown to the United States.
   The repatriation is to be the 10th since August 1987, when the
United States made a special effort to get Vietnamese help in
resolving the missing in action, or MIA, issue. Since then, 184
remains have been returned and 56 to date identified as those of
American servicemen, Trout said.
   A C-141 transport aircraft will fly a team from the U.S. Joint
Casualty Resolution Center to Hanoi airport. It will be headed by
Lieut. Col. James D. Spurgeon, who is the JCRC representative in
Bangkok.
   Trout said the remains would be flown via Guam to Hawaii, where
the U.S. military maintains a laboratory for the identification of
MIA remains.
   Official statistics show 2,353 Americans still listed as missing
from the Indochina war, including 1,719 in Vietnam, 545 in Laos, 83
in Cambodia and six in China.
   Some Americans believe Vietnam is also holding live Americans but
Hanoi has denied this and concrete evidence has yet to surface from
independent sources.
   A group of 40 U.S. congressmen is asking the Bush administration
to investigate a Japanese monk's claims that he shared a prison cell
with three captive U.S. soldiers and saw as many as 10 American
prisoners while in Vietnam.
   The reported POW sightings came from Iwanobu Yoshida, a
65-year-old Buddhist monk imprisoned for 14 years before his release
in January.
   In a letter sent last week to Bush, the congressmen urged ``a
thorough investigation of this recent account of American POWS in
Vietnam.''

<HEAD>Catholic Priest to Form New Church for Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent black Roman Catholic priest says he
will start a new ``African American Catholic Congregation'' because
the established church has failed to meet the spiritual and cultural
needs of blacks.
   ``We must now take our destiny in our own hands and create forms
of worship and parish life attuned to African Americans,'' said the
Rev. George A. Stallings Jr., the Washington archdiocese's director
of evangelism.
   He and several hundred black Catholics will launch the new
congregation on July 2 at Howard University Law School, he said.
   Although Stallings said in a statement he was sending Cardinal
James A. Hickey of Washington detailed plans for the new
congregation, members of Hickey's staff said Monday no such word has
reached the cardinal. Hickey is out of town until Thursday.
   Stallings acknowledged that the new church ``does not have the
approval, approbation or blessing'' of Hickey.
   The Rev. Kevin Hart, who as archdiocesan secretary for parish
life and worship is Stallings' boss, said Stallings has ``no
authority, no authorization to start this congregation.'' Hart said
he could not say what action the archdiocese would take.
   But in general terms, if a priest conducts a service that
deviates ``in liturgy or doctrine'' from church norms, he is
considered to be in a state of schism from the church, Hart said.
   Stallings, 41, denied that the venture is a break from
traditional Catholicism, and said it is an effort to develop ``an
African-American Catholic rite ... with our own clergy'' and the
right to ``determine our own parish life and ministry.''
   Creating a more meaningful ministry for blacks has been an issue
for many American Catholic leaders. At their semiannual meeting at
Seton Hall University last weekend, the U.S. hierarchy voted
unanimously to implement a ``Pastoral Plan for Black Catholics''
developed by the 13 black bishops in this country.
   Stallings, a convert to Catholicism, attracted national attention
as pastor of St. Teresa of Avila parish in southeast Washington when
he began to incorporate into the traditional mass gospel music and
preaching and worship styles familiar to many blacks.
   In his 12 years at St. Teresa's, membership increased from 200 to
2,000, Stallings said. There are about 80,000 black Catholics in the
Washington archdiocese.

<HEAD>Voyager 2 Finds Giant `Dark Spot' On Neptune; May Be Huge Storm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 2 spacecraft has discovered a
6,200-mile-wide dark spot on Neptune, and scientists believe it's a
giant storm similar to Earth's hurricanes and Jupiter's Great Red
Spot.
   The width is about one-fifth of Neptune's 30,700-mile diameter,
just as the 16,000-mile-wide Great Red Spot is about one-fifth the
size of Jupiter, said Andrew Ingersoll, a planetary scientist at the
California Institute of Technology.
   Voyager 2 was launched from Cape Canaveral in 1977, visited
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Its twin,
Voyager 1, explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, and is now
heading toward interplanetary space.
   ``I had gotten sort of discouraged from the Uranus encounter
because Uranus was such a bland place,'' Ingersoll said Monday. ``So
I'm happy to see such action on Neptune.''
   The top Voyager scientist was similarly excited.
   ``It's huge!'' Caltech physicist and vice president Edward Stone
said of the dark spot.
   While the robot probe is too far from Neptune to detect winds
within the spot, the spot seems to be a hurricane-like storm system
similar to the Great Red Spot, which has 250 mph winds, said Stone,
chief scientist of the Voyager project for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   Hurricanes on Earth are much smaller, measuring several hundred
miles across. Unlike Earth's hurricanes, which break up after a week
or two, Jupiter's Great Red Spot has remained intact at least since
its discovery more than 350 years ago _ a mystery scientists have
yet to explain.
   Stone said Neptune's dark spot became apparent in photographs
taken by Voyager's television cameras in April, and faint hints of
it can be seen in pictures made as early as January.
   The absence of continents on giant gas planets such as Jupiter
and Neptune may explain the persistence of the spots, Ingersoll
said, adding that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on Earth.
   Voyager 2 is due to make its closest approach to Neptune, the
solar system's fourth-largest planet, at 9 p.m. PDT Aug. 24.
   It will swoop 3,000 miles from the planet's north pole, by far
the closest approach of any of the flybys during the spacecraft's
``grand tour'' of the giant, gaseous outer planets. Five hours
later, it will pass 25,000 miles from Triton, one of two known
Neptunian moons.
   Voyager 2 today was 2.66 billion miles from Earth and 58.98
million miles from Neptune, speeding toward that planet at 42,216
mph, said Mary Beth Murrill, spokeswoman for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Neptune's dark spot is about 25 to 30 degrees latitude in the
planet's southern hemisphere, Ingersoll said.
   Voyager 2 also discovered a much smaller, rapidly changing white
spot _ about half the size of the dark spot _ at about 70 degrees
south latitude, he said.
   The dark spot's color isn't yet known because scientists haven't
processed a complete set of pictures through different color
filters, Ingersoll said. But Stone said it is darker than Neptune's
surrounding skies, which are blue-green because of methane in its
mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere.
   Jupiter's Great Red Spot is believed to get its color from
organic chemicals or possibly sulfur or phosphorus trapped within
it, said Ingersoll.
   Besides the Great Red Spot, Jupiter contains dozens of smaller
storm systems, which appear as white spots. Saturn has similar
storms, although they are less visible, Stone said.
   Computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant
storms such as the Red Spot and Neptune's dark spot, the scientists
said.
   The existence of Neptune's dark spot is mysterious because
scientists didn't think the planet had enough heat to drive fierce
winds, said Ingersoll. Unlike Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune, Uranus
lacks enough internal heat to create big storms, Stone said.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, and is about
30 times farther from the sun than Earth. But because Pluto's
elongated elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun,
Neptune will be the ninth and most distant planet from the sun until
the year 2007.

<HEAD>Bill Would Cover More Pregnant Women, Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is sponsoring legislation to
expand government health-care coverage to an additional 300,000
low-income pregnant women and 1.6 million children under the age of
six.
   Co-sponsored by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., the legislation would
cost an estimated $1 billion a year, Bentsen's office said.
   The measure would provide Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and
children under age six in families whose income is at 185 percent of
the poverty level _ $22,385 for a family of four.
   Under legislation enacted last year and being phased in this year
and next, Medicaid coverage is guaranteed to pregnant women and
infants under age 1 in families whose income is at the poverty level
_ $12,100 for a family of four.
   The estimated cost of phasing in Medicaid coverage under
Bentsen's bill would be $790 million in fiscal 1990, and $1.2
billion in 1991, when the legislation is fully in place.

<HEAD>Boating Deaths At Record Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recreational boating fatalities continued to
drop last year to a record low of 946 deaths while the number of
registered boats increased, according to the Transportation
Department.
   Coast Guard officials said the decline was the result of
increased awareness of the danger of drinking while boating.
   Fatalities declined to 946 in 1988 from 1,036 in 1987, 1,066 in
1986 and 1,116 in 1985, the department said. The 1988 figure, which
amounted to 5.5 deaths per 100,000 boats, was the lowest since the
Coast Guard began keeping track of boating fatalities 28 years ago.
   The Coast Guard estimates that there were 17.3 million boats on
the nation's waterways in 1988, an increase of 400,000 over the
previous year.

<HEAD>Vandals Destroy Fragile Rock Formations; Reward Offered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VERNAL, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vandals have shattered eight ancient rock
formations in eastern Utah's Fantasy Canyon and a $500 reward is
being offered for information leading to convictions.
   The fragile formations of sandstone were among about 50 carved
through the millenia by water erosion in the desert about 40 miles
southeast of here, said Ray Tate of the federal Bureau of Land
Management.
   ``Fantasy Canyon has a lot of the most unique rock formations
you've ever seen in your life,'' he said. ``They're very fragile.''
   The damage occurred between April 1, when agency employees were
in the area, and the third week of April, when the damage was
discovered, Tate said.
   He said one damaged formation called Camel Rock was about 16 feet
high and looked like the animal.
   ``The head came out, and it looked like it was looking back at
you,'' he said.
   Another formation resembled a thin sheet of plywood about 6 feet
high and 4 feet wide, Tate said.
   ``That was shattered,'' he said. ``You just don't see rock eroded
like that.''
   He said the formations, created between 38 million and 50 million
years ago, once were beneath a sea. Turtle fossils and dinosaur
bones have been found in the area.
   There were no signs that vandals used tools, but Tate said
physical strength would have been enough.
   ``If a person put their mind to it, they could break them pretty
good,'' he said.
   Tate said the area isn't well known or advertised, but is revered
by Vernal residents who take visitors there.
   ``They're really unhappy about it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mother Must Remain Jailed in Custody Dispute, Judge Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother jailed since August 1987 in a child
custody dispute may not be freed until she produces her daughter for
visits with her ex-husband or turns the child over to public
authorities, a judge says.
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon refused
on Monday to release Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a Washington plastic
surgeon who was jailed 22 months ago on civil contempt of court
charges.
   Morgan has refused to allow court-ordered visits between her
daughter Hilary and Eric Foretich, Morgan's ex-husband and the
girl's father, contending that Foretich sexually abused the girl.
Foretich has repeatedly denied those charges, and Hilary's
whereabouts have been unknown.
   An appeals court had directed Dixon to review his December 1988
decision to keep Morgan in jail.
   Stephen Sachs, Morgan's attorney, has argued that jailing her
failed to coerce her into producing her daughter, and that the
purpose has turned from coercion to punishment.
   But Dixon's ruling said, ``The order which causes (Morgan's)
incarceration was and continues to be for coercive purposes only,
and this has not changed due solely to the passage of time.
   ``No credible evidence has been received concerning the child's
present condition or circumstances, notwithstanding Morgan's
declaration that the the child is healthy, happy and healing,'' the
judge's ruling said.
   Dixon ruled that Morgan should remain in jail because she has not
taken the opportunity to go free by turning the child over to the
District of Columbia's child custody division.
   Sachs called Dixon's ruling ``flat-out wrong,'' adding that
Morgan ``feels the social services arrangement a booby trap by which
the child can be turned over to the father.''
   Foretich said he hopes the ruling will force Morgan to produce
their daughter.
   ``What he's done here is that he has stated that there is an
alternate method by which Elizabeth Morgan can comply,'' Foretich
said. ``This option was always available to her, and he has made
that possibility very clear.''
   The House District of Columbia Committee today was to review a
bill to limit civil contempt jailings in the district.
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., would alter
charges of civil contempt to criminal contempt after a person has
been jailed for 12 months. The measure would be applied
retroactively to Morgan's case and would guarantee her a jury trial.

   Cheryl Hayes says she won't forget the hundreds
of volunteers who in one week made her dream of a new home a reality
in the heart of Milwaukee's inner city.
   ``They'll never leave; their spirits will always be here,'' she
said. ``It's a house made of love.''
   Ms. Hayes, 40, a social worker and divorced mother of three, owns
one of six homes built last week by the Georgia-based Habitat for
Humanity International.
   The site is near where 12 people died two years ago in the city's
deadliest house fire. Less than three weeks after the blaze, a house
fire several blocks away killed six people. The death toll focused
attention on housing ills for the largely minority population of the
inner city.
   Now, Ms. Hayes, who is black, sees the efforts of Habitat as part
of a rebirth of the neighborhood where she has lived nearly a decade.
   ``This is a beautiful neighborhood,'' she said. ``This is going
to be THE neighborhood someday.''
   Former President Carter and Millard Fuller, executive director of
the organization, also think so.
   Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, spent last week working on one of
the homes. For the former president, it was the sixth year he has
spent a week pounding nails and putting up walls in a Habitat home.
   ``I just know what's happened in other places where we've worked;
it kind of rejuvenates the people,'' he said. ``The whole
neighborhood tries to stay up with them. They kind of set a
pattern.''
   The crews in Milwaukee also renovated eight other homes last week.
   Habitat officials said similar work has occurred in about 150
communities around the world as part of efforts to build more than
3,000 homes for low-income people this year.
   Habitat, founded by Fuller in 1976 and based in Americus, Ga., is
an ecumenical Christian organization that uses volunteer labor and
donated material to produce housing for needy people.
   The homes are sold for no profit with no-interest loans. The
Milwaukee homes cost from $24,000 to $26,000, with principal
payments on the 10-20 year mortgages to range from $100 to $250 a
month.
   Each buyer must put in 500 hours of labor that's called ``sweat
equity.'' The buyers work on several homes.
   ``It has a very positive impact for the families involved,'' said
Walter Farrell, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
and a board member of the First Wisconsin Bank's Community
Involvement Corp.
   ``Beyond that, it's only going to have a neighborhood impact if
there are other projects in the area, ... if the houses do not
become oases in an area of dilapidated houses.''
   He said census data show that vacant or substandard housing in
the central city is as high as 25 to 30 percent. Officials estimate
800 dwellings are abandoned.
   Taking a break from installing siding on a house, Fuller said the
whole community should work toward eliminating substandard housing
and homelessness by the year 2000.
   ``This is only one week, but what if we did it every week? What
if everybody was concerned every week about everybody having a
house? The problem would be solved in a very few years.''
   Ms. Hayes and Diana Wilson, another of the six new homeowners,
said the project stirred interest in the black community. It also
stirred their emotions.
   Ms. Wilson, 36, a school bus driver and nurse's aide who will
live in the house with her two sons, said she arrived at her new
home at 6:10 a.m. one day. No one was there.
   ``I was walking around, looking at the rooms, and I didn't even
realize I was crying. The tears were just running down my face,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet ocean liner carrying West German
tourists rammed an iceberg in the arctic Norwegian sea and was
taking on water Tuesday. Many of the more than 900 people aboard
abandoned ship, some onto ice floes.
   The 630-foot Maxim Gorky radioed north Norway's rescue central at
12:27 a.m. that it was listing after hitting an iceberg about 185
miles west of the Norwegian island of Svalbard, said a coast guard
spokesman.
   The Soviets and Norwegians said there were no reports of
injuries. Most of the passengers were West Germans, many of them
elderly.
   The ship, located east of northern Greenland, appeared stable but
was taking on water and Norwegian officials did not know if it would
sink, the Norwegian news agency NTB said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the crew had reduced the leak
``and the situation somewhat normalized ... The Maxim Gorky is
listing slightly.''
   The Norwegian coast guard vessel Senja reached the ship early
Tuesday and began rescuing 300 to 400 passengers from lifeboats and
from ice floes in near-freezing temperatures and light rain about
two miles from the Maxim Gorky. Some 225 people and the crew were
said to still be on board.
   ``The passengers appear to be in good shape and humor ... rescue
operations are somewhat difficult because the lifeboats are near the
ice, which is moving,'' said Senja captain Kjell Tveiten via the
ship's radio.
   About 575 passengers and 377 crew members were aboard the vessel,
the Soviet Merchant Marine Emergency Preparedness office told
Norwegian state radio. Tass put the total at 953.
   Tveiten said Maxim Gorky was listing to starboard and appeared
bow-heavy but did not seem to be in immediate danger of sinking.
   Some passengers had climbed onto thick ice floes to walk to
lifeboats and rafts lowered earlier from the damaged ship into the
near-freezing waters, reports said.
   The Norwegian Defense Command said six rescue helicopters were
dispatched and would begin carrying passengers to Svalbard, about a
two-hour flight.
   Several other Soviet and Norwegian ships were within 300 miles of
the distressed ship, which was in international waters.
   Hospitals in northern Norway and on the Norwegian islands of
Spitsbergen, of which Svalbard is the largest, were on emergency
alert.
   The Svalbard hospital was awaiting Norwegian medical teams
dispatched by helicopter, said reports.
   ``Maxim Gorky'' was built in West Germany in 1969 and was sold to
the Soviet Union in 1974.
   In recent summers, the liner has carried mostly West Germans on
tours from Hamburg arranged by German tour operator NUR, news
reports said.

   A man who said he wanted to hijack a plane
to Cuba shot an airport security guard in the leg with a
semiautomatic rifle before being overpowered and arrested, according
to authorities.
   Gary Thompson, 39, of Cornelius, was arrested on charges of
attempted murder and attempted air piracy, said Doug Roberts, a
spokesman for Portland International Airport.
   Donald Hudson, 70, was listed in satisfactory condition at
Providence Hospital with a leg wound.
   The shooting occurred Monday night at an airport security
checkpoint.
   Roberts said that Thompson told authorities he brought a
disassembled .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle to the airport and put
it together in a restroom.
   Thompson then approached a security checkpoint on a concourse
leading to flight gates, pointed the rifle at Hudson, told him he
would be taken hostage and demanded a flight to Cuba, Roberts said.
   Thompson shot the guard through the right thigh, Roberts said.
Police rushed to the scene and overpowered Thompson.
   Witnesses reported that Thompson yelled, ``You want to be a
hero!'' before he opened fire.
   One guard reported that during the struggle, Thompson tried to
fire the weapon again, but it didn't shoot. Thompson had apparently
inadvertently released the clip from the weapon, Roberts said.
   Roberts said Thompson bought the rifle at a sporting goods store
in Cornelius and lied on the portion of the form asking if the buyer
had ever been in a mental hospital.
   Roberts said Thompson, a Vietnam veteran, had spent time in
Dammasch State Hospital.

   A strong earthquake jolted Shemya Air Force
Base in the Aleutian Islands. No injuries or serious damage was
reported.
   The quake struck at 9:42 p.m. Monday (1:42 a.m. EDT today) and
measured 5.1 on the Richter scale. It was centered 50 miles
southwest of the base, said Alec Medbery, a spokesman at the Alaska
Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.
   He said the quake was felt sharply at the base, which is in the
western Aleutians, and knocked books off a shelf, but no injuries
were reported.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one means a tenfold increase in
magnitude.
   A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage.

<HEAD>Nicaragua's Ortega Seeks Talks With Bush to Improve Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega is seeking
talks with the Bush administration to cool Nicaragua's mounting
friction with the United States and help pull the economy out of its
nosedive.
   Ortega announced the offer Monday after a 1{-hour meeting with
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo. He asked the Roman Catholic
archbishop of Managua to carry the request for opening negotiations
to Washington.
   Obando y Bravo, a sharp critic of Ortega's leftist Sandinista
government, said he was ``going to think about this and will give an
answer'' but refused to go into details.
   There was no immediate reaction from Washington.
   The cardinal and Ortega, standing side by side, talked to
reporters after their meeting.
   ``We have asked Cardinal Obando y Bravo to ... take steps and
mediate with President Bush so that a fluid dialogue can develop,''
Ortega said. ``We are willing to develop a dialogue with the North
American government so foundations can be laid for normalizing
relations between Nicaragua and the United States.''
   The last time Nicaragua and the United States held talks on
improving relations was in June 1984 in Mexico and they ended in
deadlock.
   Many of Nicaragua's difficulties stem from a 1981 U.S. decision
to support Contra rebels and cut off all financial aid to Managua.
In 1985, Washington prohibited U.S. companies from doing business
with Nicaragua.
   Ortega said Monday he much appreciated an open letter in which
about 800 Latin American bishops recently asked Washington to lift
the embargo.
   The United States has argued that the Sandinistas' military ties
with the Soviet bloc, their purported failure to carry out
democratic reforms and their support of leftist rebels in
neighboring El Salvador endanger security in Central America.
   Nicaragua claims its support of the Salvadoran guerrillas has
only been moral _ not material.
   On June 12, the State Department accused Nicaragua of trying to
restrict foreign monitoring of February's presidential elections by
requiring Americans _ for the first time _ to acquire entry visas as
of July 1.
   On May 26, Nicaragua expelled two U.S. diplomats, accusing them
of helping incite a wildcat strikes by teachers demanding higher pay
and better working conditions.
   It was Nicaragua's second big strike in three weeks.
   Taxi drivers stopped working in many cities when prices of
gasoline _ along with most other goods _ more than doubled following
a sharp devaluation June 12 of the cordoba currency.
   The devaluation of the cordoba _ the 20th this year _ was part of
an asuterity program announced by Ortega Jan. 30 to try and check
skyrocketing inflation that surpassed 20,000 percent last year.

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen Tuesday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose sharply.
   The dollar closed at 143.80 yen, down 1.70 yen from Monday's
145.50-yen close. It opened at 143.75 yen and ranged between 143.25
yen and 144.00 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
33,233.47, up 220.29 points, or 0.67 percent. The index had lost
41.99 points the previous day.
   Yoshio Shimoyama, a dealer with Nikko Securities in Tokyo, said
the index rose on its own energy within the market.
   ``Prices were higher almost across the board, mainly because of
the yen's upswing,'' he said.
   ``But many market players were still inactive, trying to figure
out the possible direction of the foreign exchange trading,''
Shimoyama said. ``Because of the uncertainites, a majority of
institutional investors remained on the sidelines.''
   In currency dealings, the Bank of Japan reportedly sold dollars
in small amounts at about 143.60 yen to 143.70 yen, traders said.
The amount of intervention was not clear. The central bank does not
comment on its monetary activities.
   An analyst with the Bank of Tokyo said anonymously that the
currency market was nervous as participants tried to figure out the
direction of trading.
   He said the dollar-yen rate fluctuated as investors made position
adjustments.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a monthly
economic meeting that the yen's foreign exchange, which had been
fluctuating wildly due to speculative dealings, had stabilized after
a series of joint interventions with other nations, Kyodo News
Service reported.

<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers President Richard
Trumka, who brought a new era of peace to the coal industry,
presides over a union embroiled in its biggest labor dispute since
he took office seven years ago.
   A 40-year-old lawyer and the son and grandson of Pennsylvania
coal miners, Trumka has won respect from his members and from his
adversaries, the coal industry's top executives.
   But some coal officials have complained that Trumka hasn't done
enough to to bring an end to a wildcat strike that began June 12 in
southern West Virginia and by this week had spread to Kentucky,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Alabama, Illinois, Tennessee and
Missouri, idling more than 27,000 miners.
   The strikers say they won't go back until The Pittston Coal Group
signs a contract with the union, which has been on strike against
the company since April.
   ``We have no control over Pittston. We have no control over Mr.
Trumka. Yet we are being severely penalized by the strike. Our
employees are being penalized,'' said Robert Quenon, chairman of the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association, the industry's main
bargaining unit.
   ``I think the union leadership ought to exercise a leadership
role and lead the miners back to work.''
   Trumka and chief union spokesman Joe Corcoran did not return
repeated phone calls over the past nine days seeking comment about
the strike.
   On Monday, the union sent a telegram to miners advising them to
return to work in accordance with a national labor contract signed
by UMW members.
   When Trumka assumed his job in 1982, he was the UMW's fourth
president in 10 years.
   His predecessors included Tony Boyle, who went to prison for
murdering a union rival; Arnold Miller, whose health forced him to
resign, leaving the union in disarray; and Sam Church Jr., who lost
support when he negotiated a contract in 1981 that was rejected by
the rank-and-file, leading to a 72-day strike, just four years after
a 111-day walkout.
   Trumka took over a union known for its street brawls among union
officials and for widespread wildcats _ one over grievance
procedures that idled 70,000 miners in 1975 _ which the UMW leaders
appeared to be unable to control.
   He worked to focus the membership's efforts less on internal
disputes and more on fighting the companies. He won broad new powers
from the membership, including the union's first strike fund and the
authority to call selective strikes.
   He used some of those powers to negotiate a contract in 1984
without an industrywide strike, the first time in 20 years, and
again in 1988.
   An indication of his support was his re-election without
opposition in 1987 to a second five-year term.
   ``You know, coal miners can get into knock-down and drag-out
fights,'' said Local 340 President Frank Thurman in Cedar Grove.
``But when the chips are down, we know who the adversary is. The
adversary is not within. The adversary is the coal operators who
think they can reverse time and take us back.''
   Just before his re-election, Trumka discussed what he called the
union's newfound course.
   ``We've become less reactionary,'' he said. ``The mine workers
used to just wait for something to happen. Now, rather than just
reacting to things, we're starting to plan.''
   The union's strike against The Pittston Coal Group prompted last
week's sympathy strike and is the second during Trumka's tenure.
   The first was a 15-month walkout by 1,100 miners against the A.T.
Massey Coal Co. in West Virginia and Kentucky, which ended with the
union accepting the company's offer and the company being split up
by its owners. Local officials said neither side won.
   With the Pittston strike, involving 1,800 miners in Virginia,
West Virginia and Kentucky, the union has jeopardized its newfound
cooperative relationship _ and its $100 million strike fund.
   A Virginia judge has ordered fines of $3 million because of the
union's campaign of civil disobedience, and three union officials,
including strike coordinator Marty Hudson, were held for two weeks
without bail in the Roanoke, Va., City Jail for orchestrating the
picket-line activities. The three were released from jail Monday.
   The union also has been named in several damage suits filed in
U.S. District Court by companies that won back-to-work orders only
to see the miners ignore them.

   A South Korean fisherman was apparently
hit by gunfire from a U.S. Marine helicopter taking part in gunnery
practice, the U.S. military said in a statement today.
   The fisherman, Sohn Dal-gun, was hit by a bullet Monday while
fishing with two other men in the Yellow Sea off the west coast, the
statement said. The bullet apparently came from a Marine helicopter
practicing at the Koon-ni military target range on the nearby shore,
it said.
   A U.S. officer, who declined to be named, said the fisherman was
hit in the hand and the foot, but was not seriously hurt. The two
other fishermen in the boat were not hurt.
   The incident was under investigation, the statement said.
   Koon-ni Range, which is under U.S. military control, has been at
the center of a dispute with local farmers demanding the facility be
closed and the land turned over to them. Ten U.S. Air Force
personnel were hurt last month when about 150 South Koreans stormed
the range to demand it be closed.
   The United States has some 43,000 troops based in South Korea
under a joint defense treaty.

   A 28-year-old Chinese sailor jumped ship
in Western Australia and authorities said today that they were
considering his request for political asylum.
   Zhu Jianhua deserted the cargo ship Kin Shing when it docked
Saturday in Bunbury, said immigration spokeswoman Jenny Hoskin.
   The man claimed he had a pregnant wife in China and that a
relative who taught at Beijing University had been shot by the army
in Beijing.
   Zhu said he was worried letters he had written to friends in
China, supporting the pro-democracy movement, had fallen into the
hands of Chinese authorities, according to Australian Associated
Press.
   His request for asylum follows a government directive that all
15,600 Chinese citizens in Australia be allowed to stay at least one
more year even if their visas have expired.
   Immigration officials said Zhu's application to remain in
Australia was likely to be considered on humanitarian grounds.
   The government last week granted asylum to a Chinese diplomat,
35-year-old Sydney Vice Consul Dong Qi. Ms. Qi today told the
Foreign Ministry she had no public statement to make about her
defection.
   ``She asks that her privacy be respected,'' said an official, who
could not be named as is customary here.
   Zhu, who was staying at a seaman's mission in Perth, had been at
sea since Jan. 19, the AAP said.
   It said he learned of the political upheaval in China and the
army's June 4 assault on unarmed civilians in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square from Australian and British radio reports. Hundreds of
Chinese were killed in the assault and more than 1,300 have been
reported arrested since for taking part in unrest.
   Zhu told officials he hoped eventually to be reunited with his
wife and return to China.

<TEXT>
   The Florida Senate approved a bill that
would jail gun owners who don't secure their loaded weapons. The
action came in response to accidental shootings that killed three
children and wounded four this month.
   ``The nation is watching to see what Florida does,'' Sen. Jeanne
Malchon, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said before Monday's 32-4
vote sent the bill to the House.
   ``It's probably at this point one of the first bills in the
nation aimed at safety of children in access to guns,'' Senate
President Bob Crawford said.
   ``It didn't do everything that I wanted it to, but it's a bill
that will significantly encourage safety, so I'm very pleased that
we passed it.''
   A House committee was scheduled to consider the bill this morning
as the Legislature began the second day of a three-day special
session called by Gov. Bob Martinez.
   Accidental gunshots are the fifth-leading cause of death of U.S.
children under age 14, and Florida has one of the three highest
rates of accidental shootings in the country, according to Malchon,
who proposed similar legislation two years ago.
   Under the bill, adults who fail to secure a loaded weapon that is
used by a minor in an accidental shooting could be charged with a
felony and sentenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000. It
would be a misdemeanor if a minor displayed the gun or threatened
someone with it.
   Opponents narrowed the bill's scope by exempting unloaded
firearms and guns kept in cars or boats, and dropping the age of
minors to under 16 from under 18.
   Senators also decided to require the state Department of
Education to come up with a gun safety education plan by next spring
rather than adding such a provision to the bill itself.
   Marion Hammer, the National Rife Association's Florida
spokeswoman, said the legislation was ``phony, unreal and a
disservice to the people of Florida.'' She blamed the controversy on
the media.
   ``The Legislature felt that it needed to do something so that you
folks would shut up,'' she told reporters.
   The House had approved a version of the bill during the regular
session, but the Senate failed to act on it.
   In addition to taking up the Senate version, the House also was
scheduled to consider a bill that would punish anyone selling or
loaning a weapon to an unsupervised minor without parental
permission. The bill also would require gun owners to keep their
firearms locked and empty.
   Another House proposal would require gun stores to post signs to
warn gunowners about leaving loaded firearms within reach of
children.
   A rash of accidental shootings this month prompted Martinez to
include the bill in the special session, which originally was called
over a $2.4 billion turnpike expansion plan.
   Silvio Claud Pierre, 4, died Saturday a week after he had shot
himself at his family's home. The Tampa boy found a .25-caliber
semiautomatic handgun under a couch while his mother was in the
shower. His father was not at home.
   On June 6, a 10-year-old Orlando boy was killed by a playmate. On
June 5, an 8-year-old Miramar girl was killed by her 10-year-old
brother who thought his father's gun was unloaded.
   Four children, ages 4 to 16, were accidentally wounded this month.

violating Chinese martial law said today that the pro-democracy
movement remains alive in China despite the government's efforts to
suppress it.
   Brian Barron made the comments after arriving in Hong Kong from
China.
   Barron, Asian correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corp.,
said Chinese authorities returned his passport Monday after holding
it for a week following his second arrest. He was required to write
a ``self-criticism'' for violating martial law restrictions on
reporting.
   However, the 49-year-old journalist said he had not been expelled
and was free to return to China any time. He was accompanied by his
wife, daughter and three members of his television crew.
   ``We were free to leave when we liked, and we chose to leave
today,'' he said. ``After our holiday, I hope to go back to China
and continue reporting.''
   On Monday, Beijing ordered the expulsion of the sixth foreign
journalist in 10 days. Given 72 hours to leave was Joseph Kahn, an
American working part-time for the Dallas Morning News. He was in
China on a tourist visa.
   Last week, China expelled two Beijing-based American
correspondents on charges of violating martial law. In addition,
three journalists of Britain's Independent Television News, who were
not based in China, have been deported.
   After arriving in Hong Kong, Barron said he believes the
pro-democracy movement, which the government has tried to put down
beginning with the military assault in Beijing on June 3-4, still
has broad popularity.
   ``I don't think the pro-democracy movement in the sense of mass
feelings of change has been crushed,'' he told reporters at Hong
Kong airport after arriving from Beijing. Barron is based in Hong
Kong.
   ``In fact, when we drove to the airport this morning, we did see
a few truckloads of troops, but we also saw at least one individual
pass our bus and give the ``V'' sign ... the symbol of the
pro-democracy movement.
   ``We interpreted it as a gesture of defiance ... or support for
the pro-democracy movement,'' he said.
   Barron said he has covered China off and on for 15 years.
   He said he was first detained June 8 while he and his crew were
filming a burned-out tank in the capital.
   He said they were forced to kneel on the road at gunpoint. Their
equipment was seized and parts were smashed.
   His second detention a week ago was entirely different: ``We did
self-criticisms, we were not abused in any way, and after three
hours of interrogation, we were allowed to go to our hotel.''
   Under martial law, foreign reporters are barred from talking to
Chinese about martial law or taking pictures of soldiers.
Journalists generally have ignored the regulations, however.
   Barron said he continued reporting after the second arrest, and
no effort was made to stop him.

   An oil skimmer sank while helping clean up
the Exxon Valdez spill, releasing an unknown amount of oil into
Prince William Sound, the Coast Guard said today.
   No injuries were reported.
   The Retriever sank early Sunday in Northwest Bay in the sound in
about 100 feet of water, a Coast Guard official said.
   The vessel was under contract to Exxon as part of efforts to
clean up the nation's largest oil spill.
   The Coast Guard said in a statement that an unknown amount of oil
was re-released into the bay because of the sinking.

   More toxic chemicals are released into the air
in Toole County, Utah, than any other county in the United States,
the Environmental Protection Agency says.
   In fact, the 68 million pounds of toxic chemicals released in
that county each year account for all the toxic chemical releases
into the air in Utah that were reported to the EPA, the federal
agency said Monday.
   Other county hot spots for toxic industrial air pollution with
more than 45 million tons of hazardous chemical released were:
Warren County in Virginia, Mobile County in Alabama and Ascension
County in Louisiana.
   The county breakdown was included in a report that showed 2.7
billion pounds of toxic chemicals are released by industry into the
air annually. The overall figure had been reported before, but the
detailed breakdown by counties had not previously been available.
   The EPA provided no industrial plants in its summary, referring
only to the individual counties.
   But the Natural Resources Defense Council, citing the EPA report
and other agency documents, said that Amax Corp. in Rowley, Utah,
accounted for all of the reported toxic pollutants in Tooele County.
   The NRDC also cited these companies:
   _Avtex Fibers of Front Royal, Va., 50.1 million pounds, in Warren
County.
   _Courtaulds North America Inc. of LeMoyne, Ala., 42 million
pounds, in Mobile County.
   _Triad Chemical, Donaldsonville, La., 19.8 million pounds, and
C.F. Industries, also of Donaldsonville, 16.2 million pounds, in
Ascension County.
   Meanwhile, the EPA said that 25 counties accounted for two-thirds
of the discharges of toxic chemicals into surface water.
   San Bernardino County in California had by far the largest
volume, nearly 3.7 billion pounds, about two-thirds of which came
from a single company. The chemical involved was usually sodium
sulfate, which the EPA said it is planning soon to take off the
toxic chemical list on the grounds that it poses no serious health
threat.
   Harrison County in Mississippi had the next largest volume of
discharges into surface water with 369 million pounds, followed by
Harris County in Texas with 296 million pounds, according to EPA.
   Here are the 25 counties listed by EPA as having the highest
releases of toxic chemicals in the air and surface water:

   Ringo Starr will play drums and sing on his first
tour since the Beatles broke up nearly 20 years ago, The New York
Times reported today.
   Starr today planned to announce details of the tour, which starts
July 23 in Dallas and ends on Sept. 3 in Los Angeles.
   He will be accompanied in a nine-piece band by guitarist Joe
Walsh, who produced Starr's last album, ``Old Wave'' in 1983; Billy
Preston, the organist who played with the Beatles on the ``Let It
Be'' album; former members of the Band and Clarence Clemmons, the
saxophonist in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.
   The tour was arranged by David Fishof, who in recent years has
produced the Monkees reunion and ``Dirty Dancing'' tours.
   The Times said Starr is considering using some of the songs he
sang on Beatles recordings, including ``Yellow Submarine,'' ``With a
Little Help From My Friends'' and ``Octopus's Garden''
   Starr, who turns 49 in two weeks, has lived in Monte Carlo since
1976 with his wife, actress Barbara Bach.
   After the Beatles split, he has recorded nine solo albums.
   The newspaper said there are plans for a live album to be
recorded during the tour and for televising one of the concerts as a
pay-per-view event.

   A standing ovation at the end of
Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, 13 curtain calls and four
encores marked Van Cliburn's triumphant return to the concert stage
after 11 years.
   The Tchaikovsky was Cliburn's signature number after he won the
first Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1958. He was an instant
celebrity at age 23 and the first classical musician ever given a
ticker-tape parade in New York.
   Two decades later, he began an 11-year hiatus saying his schedule
of up to 100 concerts a year was too grueling.
   He has given two private performances since 1978 _ at the White
House in December 1987 during Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
visit, and January 1988 and the Bob Hope Cultural Center in Palm
Springs, Calif.
   Monday night, a crowd estimated at between 10,000 and 12,000
welcomed him back at the Mann Music Center open-air amphitheater.
Tickets sold for up top $125 each.
   ``It's so good to be back with the Philadelphia Orchestra,''
Cliburn said following Monday morning's rehearsal. ``It seems like I
never left.''
   In addition to the Tchaikovsky, Cliburn performed Liszt's Piano
Concerto No. 1 with Stanislaw Skrowaczewski guest conductor.
   Cliburn's piano was brought on stage and an uncustomary hush fell
on the audience as they waited for the tall, lanky Texan to appear.
He walked out and stood before a microphone.
   ``This is a very sentimental evening for me, an evening of
remembrance of two old friends,'' he said.
   He was referring to Eugene Ormandy, Hungarian-born music director
of the Philadelphia Orchestra for 44 years, and impressario Fredric
R. Mann, a former U.S. ambassador, who ran the Music Center in
Philadelphia's Fairmount Park from 1949 until his death in 1987. The
name was changed from Robin Hood Dell in 1980 to honor Mann.
   Cliburn joined forces with Ormandy and the Philadelphia musicians
within weeks of his Moscow triumph.
   ``I remember that time so well. We were all together then. Not
just for one concert, but several concerts,'' he said.
   The relationship continued through years of concerts and
recordings. Mann became a close friend and was later an associate
when Cliburn moved into the business world.
   Ormandy retired in 1980 and died five years later.
   Mann worked hard to build the summer classical concert season,
attended on each of the 18 concert dates by up to 10,000 people who
only had to mail in a newspaper coupon for free tickets.
   Tickets sold for up to $125, with proceeds going to the summer
classical program. General admission tickets for spots on the grassy
hillside behind the covered covered ampitheater sold for $12.50.
   Mann ``wanted everyone on the face of the Earth to believe in
classical music,'' Cliburn said, which was why the Philadelphia
Orchestra summer series was so important to him.

   University of Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer
bid an emotional farewell to college football, ending turmoil over
recruiting violations and the arrests of five players on rape,
shooting and drug charges.
   ``I finally decided the time has come for new leadership,''
Switzer said Monday. ``I will never coach at another institution. I
will never coach at another college level. I promise you that.''
   His resignation ended a 16-year career in which he brought the
Sooners three national titles and established the fourth best
all-time winning percentage.
   Officials scheduled a news conference today to name a successor.
   Gov. Henry Bellmon issued a statement praising Switzer for
posting ``an unparalleled record of success in college football
history.''
   Switzer, 52, had been under pressure since the school's football
program was placed on three years' probation by the National
Collegiate Athletics Association in December and after five players
were charged with felonies.
   One player was charged with wounding another in a dormitory
shooting, three players were charged with raping a woman in a
dormitory and one player was charged with conspiracy to distribute
cocaine.
   The state's three largest newspapers and the school's student
paper had called for Switzer's resignation, and the 1949 team
canceled a 40-year reunion because of the problems.
   
   ``It's no fun anymore. I'm drained. I don't have the energy level
to compete in this arena today,'' said Switzer, who has complained
recently about the impact of drugs on college athletics.
   Switzer also said he was frustrated by NCAA rules that do not
``recognize the financial needs of young athletes.
   ``We have created a system that does not permit me or the program
to buy a pair of shoes or a decent coat for a player whose family
can't afford these basic necessities.
   ``How can any coach stick to these rules when a young man's
father dies many miles away and the son has no money for a plane
ticket home to the funeral?''
   Switzer finished with a 157-29-4 record, an .844 winning
percentage. His teams won national championships in 1974, 1975 and
1985.

<HEAD>AMA Urged to Back Mandatory Cholesterol Labels on Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food labels would be required to include the
product's cholesterol content, caloric value and the specific source
of all vegetable oils used under a proposal presented to the
American Medical Association.
   The plan, offered by California delegates to the AMA's annual
policymaking convention, also would mandate saturated fat content
listings on labels. Cholesterol and such fats have been linked to
cardiovascular problems.
   A related resolution presented Monday asked the association to
seek truthful labeling of food products, along with warnings
regarding sodium, cholesterol and the additive content of packaged
food products.
   The AMA would call upon the Federal Trade Commission to
investigate the advertising practices of food manufacturers who
present their products as low in sodium or cholesterol under the
second plan, submitted by Dr. Louis F. Alfano, a delegate from the
American Society of Abdominal Surgeons.
   Both resolutions were referred to an AMA committee that was to
vote on whether to recommend that the association's House of
Delegates adopt them as policy.
   A critic said the measures were vague and would provide useless
and misleading information to millions of people over age 60 whose
cholesterol levels cannot be altered by what they eat.
   But supporters say many other consumers would be well-served by
such labeling.
   ``Health conscious consumers are often misled by the advertising
and labeling of common food products such as canned soups labeled as
`low sodium' which contain a substantial sodium content but are only
lower in sodium than the manfacturer's regular line of soups,''
Alfano said.
   The AMA can clear up the confusion by asking the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration to assist the consumer by requiring more
specific food labeling, he told committee members.
   Dr. Arnold Briet, an alternate delegate, presented the California
plan and said he supported Alfano's resolution.
   Cholesterol is a waxy substance that can contribute to clogged
arteries and heart disease, depending on what type of fatty proteins
carry it through the blood.
   It is produced naturally in the body and develops from eating
food with saturated fats or pure cholesterol, such as eggs, butter
and animal fat.
   The FDA has implemented labeling standards that allow foods to be
billed as cholesterol-reduced even though they still have large
amounts of cholesterol, Briet said.
   ``Nowhere do they require the source of the oils to be labeled,''
he said.
   Some plant fats, such as coconut and palm oils, contain high
amounts of saturated fatty acids that can help cholesterol form, and
food manufacturers like Nabisco Brands Inc. and Quaker Oats Co. have
taken steps to remove such oils from their products.
   Dr. Henry Mineur, an internist and delegate from New Jersey,
noted that there is an ongoing debate over so-called ``good'' and
``bad'' cholesterol. He said the proposals would be useless unless
they called for labels to differentiate between the two.
   ``Quit this damn hype'' that all types of cholesterol are bad for
everybody, Mineur told the committee.
   ``Bad'' cholesterol is carried through the bloodstream by
low-density lipoproteins linked to the buildup of harmful deposits
in the arteries.
   ``Good'' cholesterol is carried by high-density lipoproteins that
researchers believe suck up excess cholesterol in the bloodstream.
   Furthermore, Mineur argued, reducing cholesterol consumption is
only useful for those under age 60. There's no evidence that people
older than that can lower their risk of heart disease by altering
their intake of fats, he said.

   A company handling auctions for the
federal government is under investigation for the loss of millions
of dollars in profits, reports said.
   An investigation by federal authorities centers on allegations
that Northrop Worldwide Aircraft Services Inc. took auction profits
through bill padding and fraud, NBC News reported Monday evening.
   The Crescent City, Calif.-based company has a contract with the
U.S. Customs Service to recover, maintain and sell seized or
forfeited personal property, usually through auctions.
   U.S. Attorney Bob Wortham is presenting his findings to a federal
grand jury here, The Beaumont Enterprise reported.
   Wortham said the Department of Justice prohibited him from
discussing any investigation.
   Northrop spokesman Tony Canpafio said the company is working with
the government in the investigation.
   ``We've been subpoenaed and we've provided documents,'' Canpafio
said.
   First word on the investigation was in April at a hearing before
a U.S. House Ways and Means Committee subcommittee chaired by Rep.
J.J. Pickle, D-Texas.
   Pickle said lax accounting controls account for the loss of
millions of dollars in the Customs' auctions. In fiscal 1988,
Customs agents made more than 53,000 property seizures with a
domestic value of about $1.1 billion.
   The investigation began after area banker George Talbert
complained of fees charged by Northrop to sell a vehicle seized in a
drug-related arrest in Lumberton in 1987.
   The First State Bank of Lumberton had a lien of $4,700 to $5,000
on the Chevrolet Suburban, Talbert said. Talbert, who worked at the
bank, said Customs offered to buy the car for $4,500 but later told
him it would be auctioned and money left after expenses would go to
the bank.
   Customs estimated the vehicle's value at about $8,500. Northrop
auctioned it in Houston for $4,300, and charged $700 to tow the
vehicle 90 miles to the auction and a $1,400 commission. The bank
was left with about $1,900.
   ``I was mad,'' Talbert said. ``I wrote to the company, asking for
a detailed statement of their expenses.''
   Talbert also wrote Wortham. After Wortham's office investigated
the sale, the company sent the bank an additional $1,000, he said.
   The investigation widened in January when authorities obtained a
search warrant for Northrop's Lawton, Okla., offices to obtain
transcripts on all Customs auctions for the past three years.
   In affidavits, Customs agents said Northrop employees contended
the company billed Customs for maintaining and storing seized
property for as long as three months after the property was disposed.
   Agents also reported Northrop withheld information stored in one
computer when agents served a subpoena issued by a grand jury in
Beaumont requesting all business records concerning Northrop's
contract with Customs.
   Its commissioner, William Von Raab, said the agency loses money
on its auctions because Customs warehouses store more than just
fancy cars and boats.
   ``When you lump all of our forfeitures together including those
made let's say of fruit that doesn't meet FDA (Food and Drug
Administration) rules or blue jeans that violate a quota or mismark,
then we don't make a profit,'' he said.
   Some in Congress say there is no excuse for Customs to lose money
on their auctions, especially when the seized property is acquired
at no cost.
   ``Either the auctions are rigged or else they're being very
poorly run,'' said Rep. Richard Schulze, R-Pa.

<HEAD>State Senator Declines Run for Wright's Seat, Says Wright Should

<TEXT>
   The man mentioned as Jim Wright's most
likely congressional successor urged the former House speaker to try
to retain his seat, saying he was still the best representative for
the district.
   ``Nobody has a right to tell the people of Fort Worth and this
community who their congressman ought to be,'' state Sen. Hugh
Parmer told reporters Monday.
   ``The people of this community ought to make that choice. And I
am persuaded, having talked to them, that if they have that option
they will overwhelmingly re-elect Jim Wright as the congressman from
the 12th District.'' Parmer said his fellow Fort Worth Democrat and
longtime friend either should remain in Congress or, if he fulfills
his promise to resign, run again for the seat in a special election.
   About 30 supporters at a Saturday breakfast urged Wright to put
his name on the ballot in a special election for the 12th District
seat, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported today.
   The newspaper said Wright neither encouraged nor discouraged the
effort to draft him but told supporters he ``would think about
running,'' according to some who were at the meeting.
   Wright spokesman Mark Johnson said the congressman was gratified
by supporters' suggestions, but ``is not encouraging this and his
plans have not changed.''
   Wright resigned May 31 as speaker and said he'd give up his House
seat by the end of June to end a furor over allegations he violated
House ethics rules.
   ``He is proceeding with the transition'' into private life by the
end of June, Johnson said, though no resignation date has been set.
   Parmer had been mentioned most often as the likeliest Democrat to
run for the post Wright has held since 1954.
   But at a news conference in Austin earlier Monday, Parmer said he
was sticking with his announced plan to challenge Republican U.S.
Sen. Phil Gramm in 1990. Parmer waited for his afternoon appearance
at Fort Worth's Meacham Field airport to throw his support behind
Wright.
   ``The vast majority of people in Fort Worth believe that while
Jim may have made some mistakes of judgment, as Jim has admitted ...
it did not warrant the kind of penalty or price that he is talking
about paying,'' he said.
   Asked whether Wright still planned to leave office, Parmer said,
``I would say that he said neither yes, nor no. He simply listened
to what I had to say.''

   Attorneys for Richard Ramirez rested their
case after calling 35 witnesses but passing up the chance to have
the defendant testify in the 5-month-old ``Night Stalker'' murder
trial.
   Defense attorney Ray Clark said Monday the decision on whether to
testify was left to Ramirez and he decided not to take the witness
stand.
   The 29-year-old drifter from El Paso, Texas, is charged with 13
murders and 30 related felonies in a crime wave that terrorized
California during the summer of 1985. Pentagrams, a symbol of devil
worship, were found at some murder scenes and the assailant gouged
out the eyes of one victim.
   Ramirez is a self-proclaimed devil worshiper who once shouted
``Hail Satan'' in court. A jailer testified that he used his own
blood to draw a pentagram on the floor of his cell.
   During the defense's month-long presentation, attorneys called
witnesses who gave Ramirez alibis for some of the killings. Most
notably, Ramirez' father testified that the defendant was home in El
Paso when two of the slayings occurred.
   The defense also entered 65 pieces of evidence and attacked the
credibility of witnesses who identified Ramirez as the shaggy haired
killer who entered homes through unlocked windows and doors.
   Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin said he planned to
begin presenting rebuttal witnesses today. He said his rebuttal
should take about a week. The prosecution has presented 137
witnesses and 521 pieces of evidence.
   Clark said it was unlikely the defense would call any more
witnesses after rebuttal.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan scheduled final arguments to
begin July 10, after the jury takes a week vacation.
   The case appears headed for a conclusion far sooner than the two
years anticipated when the trial began.
   But Halpin said he was still disturbed by the four years that
have elapsed since Ramirez was arrested. The trial followed years of
pretrial motions and a lengthy preliminary hearing.
   ``We have not done this efficiently,'' Halpin said, adding he
hoped the court system would learn from the case that ``we can't
take forever to try these cases.''

   Burma has officially changed its name in
English to the Union of Myanmar and renamed the capital of Rangoon
to Yangon, the state-run Working People's Daily said.
   Also Monday, the military government tightened controls on
political literature and reopened primary schools nationwide, one
year after all classrooms were closed in the wake of pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   The government said it would reopen junior high schools, high
schools and universities but has not given specific dates.
   In the law changing Burma's name, the nationality _ Burmese _
also was changed to Myanmar. The word for Burma and Burmese in the
Burmese language are both pronounced Myanmar.
   The names of states, towns and other geographical sites are to be
written in English according to the Burmese pronunciation, the law
says. Rangoon, for example, is to be written as Yangon, which is the
Burmese pronunciation of the capital.
   The military rulers who seized power in September while brutally
putting down the popular uprising for democratic reforms had already
dropped the term ``Socialist Republic,'' calling the country the
Union of Burma in English.
   The move was an apparent attempt to appease a populace angered by
a quarter century of ruinous socialist policies.
   The latest change in the country's name, government officials
say, is to better reflect Burma's ethnic diversity. The term Burma
connotes Burman _ the dominant race in the country _ to the
exclusion of ethnic minorities.
   Several minority groups have been fighting for greater autonomy
from the central government for four decades.
   The government on Monday increased penalties against violators of
a 1962 law on publications, increasing maximum prison terms from
three to seven years and fines from $320 to $4,800 for those who
publish material without proper registration.
   The act says printing presses must be registered with authorities
and forbids falsification of facts in declarations by printers and
publishers.
   Saw Muang's military council has promised general elections next
year and allowed the formation of opposition political parties, and
many of the 200 parties have published anti-government pamphlets
without official permission.

<HEAD>Foley Sees Raises For Judiciary; Tied to Congressional Raise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Tom Foley said federal judges and
senior executive branch employees should get pay raises.
   Foley said that before any action is taken on the pay boosts for
judges and executive branch employees he would wait for a report
that's expected to recommend a pay increase for Congress.
   The report, likely to be completed this summer, is expected to
suggest a ban on speaking fees and other honoraria in exchange for
the pay raise.
   ``It may well be that they'll recommend that we phase out
honorariums over a period of years with perhaps an increase over a
period of years starting in the next Congress for members of
Congress,'' Foley said Monday during a political fund-raiser in New
York.
   ``But in any event, whatever happens, I want to see this Congress
propose and send to the president an increase for judges and for
senior civil servants in the executive branch.''
   Foley's comments are the first indication that Congress is
willing to reopen the politically volatile issue.
   The House in February, faced with a public outcry, killed a 51
percent pay increase for judges, senior executives and legislators
in what was seen as a major defeat for then-Speaker Jim Wright.
   Since the vote, Congress has been pressured to increase the
salary of senior executive branch employees and federal judges,
whose salaries traditionally are tied to those of Congress.
   With the renewed interest in ethics in Washington, Congress has
been considering a ban on speaking fees and other outside sources of
income.
   Judicial and executive branch employees already are forbidden
from accepting most speaking fees and other outside income.

<HEAD>FAA Workers At Some Airports Get Added Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DES PLAINES, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials say they hope an offer
of higher pay will attract and keep air traffic controllers at the
nation's busiest towers and control centers.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner announced that 2,100
Federal Aviation Administration controllers, technicians and safety
inspectors at 11 facilities in the New York, Chicago, Los Angeles
and Oakland areas will get pay raises of up to 20 percent.
   ``The air traffic controllers in the busiest centers of this
country will be some of the highest paid people in the federal
government,'' Skinner said Monday at FAA offices near O'Hare
International Airport, the nation's busiest. ``I've been to those
centers and frankly I think those jobs deserve that kind of
compensation.''
   Many FAA control rooms have been chronically understaffed since
former President Reagan fired some 11,400 air traffic controllers
during an illegal strike in August 1981.
   The new plan was criticized as ``a Band-Aid on a hemorrhage'' by
Ray L. Spickler, executive vice president of the National Air
Traffic Controller Association. He said the raises would cover only
a fraction of a nationwide work force of 16,000.
   The union was certified to represent the nation's 7,000 air
traffic controllers in 1987, replacing the Professional Air Traffic
Controllers Organization, which was decertified after the 1981
strike.
   ``It will address short-term problems,'' union spokesman Tony
Dresden said of the wage plan. ``We would hope that the FAA would
look at fair compensation for all controllers.''
   FAA officials say the agency has difficulty staffing the 11
facilities with qualified workers because of high living costs,
complex operations and other unattractive features.
   In addition, many workers in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles
are close to retirement age, Skinner said.
   United Airlines, which has been urging higher salaries at O'Hare,
applauded the program.
   ``We believe this action is an encouraging step toward improving
O'Hare's ability to efficiently handle commercial air traffic at the
nation's busiest airport,'' the carrier said.
   Transportation Department officials said the program will cost an
extra $5 million a year from department funds, requiring minor
cutbacks in other programs. The 5-year demonstration project will be
made permanent if it is successful, Skinner said.
   Top-level air traffic controllers now make $60,000 to $65,000 a
year, including overtime, before the raises.
   Skinner said union representatives indicate the program is
already working at targeted facilities. The FAA has received a lot
of applications for the positions since the program was announced in
March, and those applying are highly skilled.
   The program earlier this year survived attempts by Congress to
restrict it workers at O'Hare and limit raises to 10 percent of base
pay, department officials said.
   The FAA facilities affected by the incentive plans include air
traffic control centers in Aurora, Ill., and Ronkonkoma, N.Y.; and
the O'Hare and Los Angeles international airport towers and terminal
radar approach control facilities.
   The program also covers approach-control facilities at Westbury,
N.Y., Santa Ana and Oakland, Calif.; and flight standards district
offices in Los Angeles; Farmingdale and Valley Stream, N.Y.; and
Teterboro, N.J.

   Jurors in the trial of a man charged with stabbing
his wife to death heard a tape recording of the woman's plea for
help, followed by her husband telling her she was ``bleeding just
like a stuck hog.''
   Alfred Lavers, 48, is charged with murder in the May 13, 1988,
stabbing deaths of his wife, Mary, and 11-year-old stepdaughter,
Jennifer Burns.
   The tape played Monday was found by police in a recorder under
pillows in the stepdaughter's room. It contained a 90-minute
recording of the domestic dispute that culminated in Mrs. Lavers'
terrifying screams.
   ``I'm dying,'' Mrs. Lavers was heard saying, just after she
allegedly was stabbed by her husband.
   ``I know you are,'' he said.
   ``Please help me,'' she said.
   ``You're bleeding just like a stuck hog. I love you so much,'' he
said.
   The victims' relatives sat fighting back emotion in the front row
of the spectators' section as the tape was played. An elderly woman
later identified as one of Mrs. Lavers' relatives broke down in
tears and was led out.
   There was no discernible reaction by jurors, who followed the
tape with a transcript.
   Lavers, 48, voluntarily removed himself from the Maricopa County
Superior courtroom while the tape was played.
   He returned for the defense portion of the case, in which public
defender Roland Steinle called only one witness _ a police officer
who said Lavers appeared ``out of it'' when he was arrested and
booked.
   Steinle is attempting to show that Lavers was intoxicated when he
stabbed the women, acted without premeditation and should be found
guilty of a lesser crime.
   The trial resumes Wednesday.

<HEAD>Rain in Southeast; Flash Flood Warnings in Five States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms produced more heavy rain in sections of
the Southeast, and flash flood watches remained in effect today for
parts of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   About 1{ inches of rain fell in 45 minutes at Mount Sterling,
Ky., flooding streets and basements and backing up sewers, and more
than three-quarters of an inch fell in an hour at Louisville, Ky.
   On Monday, Alabama farmers moved livestock to higher ground and
riverfront homeowners set out sandbags as weather officials warned
of more rainfall and the expected cresting of the Alabama and
Tallapoosa rivers.
   A storm that dumped more than an inch of rain an hour in east
Alabama flushed creeks across rural roads Monday and forced
officials to open rarely used flood gates on Lake Martin.
   In Kentucky, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson toured flood-damaged eastern
sections of the state and predicted federal officials would declare
the area a disaster. State officials said damage from torrential
rains that fell last week was in the millions of dollars.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across western
portions of the northern Plains. Winds gusted to 60 mph in Miles
City, Mont. Thunderstorms erupted Monday night across the eastern
slopes of the Rockies, where winds gusted to 60 mph at Vedauwoo, Wyo.
   Other thunderstorms were scattered from north-central Nebraska
into the northern Plains, and light rain dampened the Pacific
Northwest.
   Intense heat in the Southwest contributed to the heat stroke
death of a 5-year-old girl who became locked in a car trunk in her
driveway Sunday as the outdoor temperature climbed to 104 degrees,
police said. Authorities said the death appears to be an accident.
   Today's forecast calls for numerous showers and thunderstorms
from the central Gulf Coast through much of the Ohio Valley, and in
the Middle Atlantic and Southeast states; showers and a few
thunderstorms scattered from Washington across central Montana; and
widely scattered showers and thunderstorms mainly in the higher
elevations of the northern and central Rockies.
   Predicted highs: in the 70s and 80s east of the Mississippi
River, and from the central and northern coasts of California across
northern Nevada to eastern Montana; the 60s over the Pacific
Northwest and Idaho; the 90s over the central Rockies, the Plains
and much of the Mississippi Valley; and over 100 degrees in the
central Plains, and from the Desert Southwest to southwest Texas.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41 degrees at Missoula,
Mont., to 93 degrees at Valentine, Neb., Las Vegas, and Phoenix.

   Eighteen Chinese refugees arrived by
boat in the Philippines last week after fleeing the political
turmoil in their country, a U.N. official said today.
   Karola Paul, deputy representative of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, said the 16 men and two women arrived June 13 aboard a
wooden boat in Batanes province, 410 miles north of Manila.
   She said the agency told its regional offices last week that
Chinese might try to flee because of the suppression of dissent
following the June 4 killing of hundreds of unarmed pro-democracy
protesters by troops in Beijing.
   Miss Paul said she did not know where the Chinese boat people
came from but would ask Philippine authorities to grant custody to
her agency.
   The Chinese, who did not have travel papers, were taken to army
headquarters in Manila and were to be interviewed by immigration
officials, she said.
   ``To me, they are asylum-seekers,'' Miss Paul said. ``We have
been alerted of an outflow from China since the turmoil. But it
would be very difficult to say if there will be more.''
   Also today, two Manila newspapers reported that the Philippine
Embassy in Beijing had received queries from Chinese students
seeking asylum but discouraged them for fear of offending the
Beijing government.
   Malaya and The Manila Chronicle quoted an unidentified source in
the Department of Foreign Affairs as saying the decision to put off
applicants was taken on the recommendation of Philippine diplomats
in the Chinese capital.
   ``It would not be favorable for the Philippines because we do not
have the muscle to do what the U.S. is doing,'' the newspapers
quoted the source as saying. ``We don't have a bargaining chip with
China.''
   China has sharply criticized the United States for sheltering
Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing.
   President Corazon Aquino has deplored the violence in Beijing but
stopped short of criticizing China's leadership.
   Last year, she visited China and received assurances from senior
leader Deng Xiaoping that Beijing would not support Filipino
Communist rebels seeking to establish a Marxist state in this
country.
   Western and Filipino sources say there is no evidence China is
supporting the insurgents.

<HEAD>Northerners Head South to Mark Civil Rights Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Northerners have embarked on a
pilgrimage to one of the shrines of the civil rights movement of the
1960s to commemorate the slayings of three young men in
Philadelphia, Miss.
   A 13-bus convoy carrying about 500 Northerners left here Monday
for ceremonies marking the 25th anniversary of the slayings.
   ``I expect to learn about how they got involved, why they got
involved,'' said Craig Johnson, 21, an Antioch College student who
is working as a summer intern in Philadelphia city government. ``It
will help us to appreciate what they endured.''
   The buses, including three from New York City, were scheduled to
arrive today in Meridian, Miss., near the small town of
Philadelphia, where ceremonies Wednesday will honor James Earl
Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.
   The three men were shot to death June 21, 1964, after they had
gone to inspect a church burned by the Ku Klux Klan. Their bodies
were found 44 days later in an earthen dam.
   ``It is important to commemorate the sacrifices that were made in
the civil rights movement,'' said Larry Pitt, 37. The Philadelphia,
Pa., attorney came up with the idea for the convoy last winter after
watching the movie ``Mississippi Burning,'' a dramatization of the
slayings and the resulting investigation.
   ``It gives us the opportunity to bring into the consciousness of
the whole country the need for a continuing commitment to civil
rights,'' Pitt said.
   Seven men eventually were convicted in federal court of violating
the three men's civil rights. Another defendant pleaded guilty,
eight were acquitted and the cases against the three others ended in
mistrials. Murder charges were dropped in state court.
   The Philadelphia to Philadelphia Project is sponsored by the
Chaney, Goodman, Schwerner Memorial Coalition, which is co-chaired
in Pennsylvania by Mayor W. Wilson Goode, U.S. Rep. William H. Gray
III, Pitt and seven others, and in Mississippi by Secretary of State
Dick Mopus.
   Goode, the first black mayor of the nation's fifth-largest city,
will fly to Mississippi with about 150 people Wednesday to address a
``commemoration of the past'' at Mount Zion Methodist Church in
Philadelphia.
   James Farmer, former executive director of the Congress of Racial
Equality, and members of the victims' families also will speak.
   The Pennsylvania convoy will leave Mississippi on Thursday as
will a south-to-north convoy that will stop in Washington for
meetings with members of Congress and a rally at the Capitol Friday.
The convoy will go to New York Saturday for a ceremony at St. John
the Divine Church.
   Several participants said the trip will provide valuable insight.
   ``To know where you're going, you've got to know where you came
from,'' said Jack Franklin, 67, a curator at the Afro-American
Historical and Cultural Museum in Philadelphia, Pa.
   He said he was struck by the small proportion of whites boarding
the buses in Pennsylvania.
   ``When Martin Luther King marched, there was 25 to 30 percent
whites,'' he said. ``Here, it's maybe 1 percent. That will give you
something to think about. That will give you an idea where the
country is headed. I'm not being bitter. I'm just telling you the
truth.''
   But Pitt, the organizer, said he hoped the trip would demonstrate
that the civil rights legacy belongs to all Americans.
   ``The lessons we intend to present this week are lessons which
the country must learn, which is that the price of liberty is
eternal vigilance, that the civil rights movement, though it was
focusing on the rights of blacks, was an American movement, a
patriotic movement.''

   Afghan government forces have seized
an American free-lance photographer who was traveling with Moslem
guerrillas on assignment for Life magazine, resistance sources say.
   He is the first American believed captured by Afghans during the
civil war.
   Guerrillas sources identified him Monday as Tony O'Brien, 42, a
photographer from Santa Fe, N.M. He had been covering the Afghan war
based in the Pakistan frontier city of Peshawar.
   The Afghan government did not confirm the arrest immediately.
   U.S. Embassy officials in Pakistan cited the U.S. Privacy Act and
said they could not comment on such a capture.
   O'Brien was seized last Wednesday in Kabul, the Afghan capital,
guerrilla sources in Pakistan said on condition of anonymity. He is
being held in Kabul and is reported in good condition, they said.
   At least three Western correspondents and two foreign aid workers
have been captured in the past while traveling with the guerrillas.
All were later released unharmed.
   O'Brien had made several forays into Afghanistan with the
guerrillas. His photographs have appeared in major U.S.
publications, including The New York Times and Time magazine.
   ``He had snuck into the country disguised as a Moslem guerrilla.
I saw photos of him in that garb,'' said free-lance writer William
Hart, who has known O'Brien for 15 years.

   Shadd, who plans to attend Kansas State University on a

before the prom to say he had hurt his ankle and would not be able
to escort her.
   ``She just didn't believe me,'' Shadd said. ``She thought I was

   Shadd and Ms. Mangrum have not spoken since the suit was filed,
said Valerie Mangrum, Tomontra's mother.
   ``He has refused to apologize to her, but she felt like the check
was apology enough,'' the mother said.

<HEAD>Sub Cuts Fishing Net Two Days After Sinking Tug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear submarine that pulled a tugboat
under, killing a crewman, cut a fishing boat's net two days later,
the Navy said.
   The USS Houston sliced the net Friday night outside Los Angeles
Harbor as the craft headed home on the surface for San Diego after
taking part in filming of the movie ``The Hunt for Red October,''
said Lt. Sonja Hedley, a Navy spokeswoman.
   Hedley would not give the sub's precise location but said the
fishing boat ``was in the traffic lane you shouldn't be in ...
trawling.''
   However, she added: ``If we cut his net, we'll pay for his net
and that's all there is to it. People cross fishing nets like that
and clip them all the time.''
   Capt. James C. Card, commander of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety
Office, said the fisherman's description of his location would have
placed the trawler in a legal spot just outside the shipping
channels.
   On Wednesday, the fast-attack sub snagged a tow cable and pulled
a tugboat to the ocean bottom, killing a tug pilot.
   John M. Emirzian, skipper of the 33-foot trawler, said the sub
cut a new $3,800 net and cost him a two-day catch.
   ``There was a million deck lights on,'' he said. ``It looked like
Chicago out there. All they had to do was look.''

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's official executioner, a
skilled swordsman who has dispatched more than 600 convicted
criminals, says beheading is less difficult than chopping off the
hands of thieves.
   ``Frankly, it's easier to chop off a head since this act means
the end of the story for the criminal,'' Saeed Al-Sayyaf, 60, said
in an interview with the Saudi newspaper Al-Medina.
   ``Chopping off a hand needs more courage, since you are cutting
off a part of the body of an individual who is to survive,'' he said.
   The act requires ``very skilled attention to ensure that the
sword does not slip or cut in the wrong place,'' Saeed said in the
interview, which was republished by a Dubai-based English-language
newspaper, the Khaleej Times.
   His name has an odd ring in Arabic: Saeed means ``happy'' and
Al-Sayyaf ``swordsman executioner.'' He changed his second name when
he was appointed to the job more than 35 years ago.
   The executioner says he doesn't suffer remorse for his victims
since he is carrying out Islamic justice as required by the Koran,
the holy book of Islam. The Koran decrees that convicted murderers
be beheaded and thieves lose a hand. Saudi authorities last year
ruled that drug smugglers also should be executed.
   Al-Sayyaf started out as a farmer, but joined the Saudi army at
the age of 20. He said that ``watching executioners'' as they
beheaded criminals publicly after Friday prayer sessions became his
favorite hobby.
   He later applied for the job of ``sayyaf'' which carried a salary
of $36 a month, plus an additional $133 ``for each head.''
   Al-Sayyaf said he carried out his first execution at age 23,
beheading three criminals and ``earning 1,500 riyals'' ($399).
   ``I always look forward to the opportunity to chop off more heads
so that I can earn more money,'' he said.
   ``Over a period of time it became a very easy sort of job ... In
fact I felt it was easy to do an execution,'' he added. ``I have
chopped off the heads of more than 600 criminals and cut off 60
hands of thieves.''
   Al-Sayyaf said he first slices off the upper part of a convict's
shirt with his sword to expose the kneeling victim's neck. Then he
uses a single swift stroke that sends blood gushing and the head
rolling on the sand.
   But he uses a pistol for executing women in order to avoid having
to cut off their clothing and reveal naked flesh.
   Al-Sayyaf admits that he often has sleepless nights before
executions ``worrying that I might fail.''
   But once the beheading is over, he feels ``delighted and
satisfied'' for having put an end to ``what's against the law of
God.''
   ``I was very happy when I executed a drug trafficker,'' Al-Medina
quoted him as saying.
   These days, those awaiting execution have their eyes covered by a
black blindfold.
   That was introduced after ``I chopped off the head of one convict
and it fell directly in front of the second, who suddenly collapsed
and fell to the ground and died of a heart attack.''
   His most memorable executions took place in 1979, when he
beheaded 12 convicts in one session. They were all members of a
group of Moslem fundamentalists who seized the Grand Mosque in
Mecca, Islam's holiest shrine, in an attempt to topple the
government.
   Al-Sayyaf has married 24 times and fathered 25 sons and
daughters. Under Islam, a man is permitted four wives.
   He says his grim job doesn't affect his social life.
   Al-Sayyaf has been training one of his sons, Mohammed, to be his
successor.
   ``I have not yet given Mohammed the opportunity to carry out an
execution but I do feel that he knows the job,'' he said. ``A number
of my relatives are reluctant at the thought of my training them.''

<HEAD>3 Dead, Curfew Imposed to Restore Order in Kazakhstan</HEAD>

   At least three people were killed and more than 50
injured in the Soviet republic of Kazakhstan in brawling, arson and
rioting spawned by ethnic and economic problems, a government
spokesman said today.
   Hundreds of Interior Ministry soldiers and extra police were sent
to Novy Uzen, a city of 55,000 people near the Caspian Sea, and a
curfew was imposed to restore order, Interior Ministry spokesman
Boris Mikhailov told a news briefing.
   It was the third instance in six weeks in the vast central Asian
region in which ethnic tension and economic frustration have spilled
over into violence.
   In the worst violence, about 100 people were killed in
neighboring republic of Uzbekistan this month.
   The region is being buffeted by a rapidly increasing population,
pollution, a lack of jobs, an increase in ethnic divisions and a
resurgence of Islam.
   A man who answered the telephone at an emergency headquarters set
up in Novy Uzen said a 9 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew had been imposed. The
man, who identified himself only as Murzagalev, said there had been
a demonstration today but refused to elaborate.
   Mikhailov said since the violence began Friday night, three
people had died and 53 were hurt. He did not identify the dead or
injured, or say how they died.
   Fifty-seven people were arrested, he said.
   The spokesman said much of the violence appeared to be aimed at
traders from the Caucasus Mountain region, located on the opposite
side of the Caspian Sea.
   Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis are the main ethnic groups
in the Caucasus, but Mikhailov said he did not know what group was
targeted.
   More than 700 of them, mostly women and children, were evacuated
from Novy Uzen, he said.
   ``They're now under heavy guard at a bus station 14 kilometers
(8.5 miles) from the city, and the roads to the station are
blocked,'' he said.
   Mikhailov said about 7,000 people gathered Monday in the town's
main square demanding that cooperative businesses be closed and
people from the Caucasus republics be sent home.
   ``Two battalions of Interior soldiers were brought in to stop the
unrest,'' Mikhailov said. ``The crowd was dispersed, but it broke
into several large groups of youths armed with pipes and stones, and
other objects. They went along the streets, organizing brawls,
pogroms and arson.''
   Reports on Monday said youths had tried unsuccessfully to seize a
police station, and that they were armed with guns and gasoline
bombs.
   Cooperatives are privately owned businesses that have been
permitted under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms to
provide an alternative to the state-run economy.
   But many Soviets suspect cooperative owners of profiteering and
serving as a front for organized crime.
   In Uzbekistan, officials have blamed the violence on outside
instigators. But members of the Uzbek majority and Meskhi Turk
minority, the target of most of the violence, have said overcrowding
and unemployment contributed to it.
   More than 10,000 Meskhi Turks were evacuated from cities in
Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley to a refugee camp as a protective
measure.
   Authorities on Monday announced a program to create 200,000 jobs,
reduce pollution and diversify agriculture, which is now based on
cotton production, in an effort to reduce tensions in Uzbekistan.
   In Turkmenia, a republic south of Kazakhstan, mobs rampaged
through the streets in early May with demands that cooperatives be
closed and Armenian traders be forced to leave the area.
   The first outbreak of ethnic violence under Gorbachev was in Alma
Ata, the Kazakhstan capital, in December 1986. Rioters burned
vehicles and shops to protest the replacement of the republic
Communist Party chief, a Kazakh, with an ethnic Russian.

<TEXT>
   The Illinois Supreme Court has struck
down a law allowing videotaped testimony by child victims of sexual
abuse.
   The court Monday declared the 1987 law unconstitutional because
it deprives the accused of the right to confront their accusers at
trial.
   The law, enacted by the Legislature over Gov. James R. Thompson's
veto, allows the defense to cross-examine the child witness about
the videotaped testimony during the trial but not during the taping
itself.
   ``Cross-examination often depends for its effectiveness on the
ability of counsel to punch holes in a witness' testimony at just
the right time, in just the right way,'' said Justice John Stamos,
citing a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a case from Iowa.
   Illinois is one of several states that have adopted so-called
``child shield'' laws intended to protect young victims of sexual
abuse from the trauma of testifying in open court and to minimize
their fright and confusion.
   The law applied only to certain sexual offenses committed against
a child 12 or younger, but in declaring it unconstitutional the
justices said they were worried it would be expanded to include the
elderly or handicapped.
   In vetoing it, the governor predicted it would be declared
unconstitutional.
   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of an
Iowa man who was made to testify behind a one-way screen to prevent
his accusers from seeing him. He had been found guilty of molesting
two 13-year-old girls.
   The high court said the man's rights to a fair trial and to
confront his accusers appeared to have been violated.

<TEXT>
   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis
today was given three days to form a new government, and a leftist
alliance rejected his offer to join a coalition.
   Mitsotakis' center-right New Democracy Party finished first in
Sunday's elections, defeating Premier Andreas Papandreou's
Panhellenic Socialist Movement. But New Democracy failed to win a
majority needed to govern.
   President Christos Sartzetakison, as outlined by the
constitution, today gave Mitsotakis three days to form a governing
coalition. If he is unable to form a government, Papandreou's party
will be given the same opportunity.
   The Coalition of Left and Progress, a leftist-communist coalition
that finished third, said it would consider a governing coalition
with Papandreou's party if the premier resigned as party leader. But
the leftists rejected an offer from Mitsotakis to form a new
government.
   Mitsotakis refused to say what he planned to do following the
rejection of his coalition offer.
   If neither of the top two finishers in the election can form a
government, the president will ask the third place Coalition of Left
and Progress to form a government.
   If all three fail, the president appoints a caretaker government
to prepare for new elections.
   The Panhellenic Socialist Movement has hinted it would seek to
lead a leftist coalition if it was offered the exploratory mandate.
   New Democracy gained 44.37 percent of Sunday's vote and 144
seats, seven short of a majority in the 300-member Parliament.
Papandreou's party took 39 percent and 125 seats. The Coalition of
Left and Progress, an alliance of Communist and Greek Left parties,
received 13 percent and 29 seats.
   On Monday, Mitstotakis asked the leftist alliance to join him in
an interim government with a limited mandate confined to cleaning up
the financial scandals that have tainted the Papandreou government.
   Mitsotakis said the partnership would last ``only a few months,''
until those guilty of involvement in the scandals were punished.
Then he would call new elections.
   ``I hope that all other parties will do all in their power to
prevent the scandals from being written off,'' Mitsotakis said.
   But Harilaos Florakis, the leader of the Greek Communist Party
and president of the leftist alliance, said his group wants to form
a leftist government that would exclude people tainted by scandal.
   Florakis said it would consider forming a government with the
Panhellenic Socialist Movement if Papandreou, who has ruled since
1981, resigned as its leader.
   Papandreou and senior members of his party have been accused of
being involved in the $200 million fraud, forgery and embezzlement
scheme at the Bank of Crete. George Koskotas, the owner of the bank,
is detained in prison in the United States pending the hearing of an
extradition request by the Greek government.
   The socialsts have also been accused of widespread corruption and
of involvement in a series of arms scandals.

<TEXT>
   U.S. industrial plants are spewing 360 million
pounds of suspected cancer-causing chemicals into the air annually
with releases from each of the 30 biggest polluters exceeding 1
million pounds, according to government statistics.
   The pollution figures were released Monday by a private
environmental group and confirmed by the Environmental Protection
Agency, which provided the raw statistics based on information
provided by industry under a fledgling public disclosure law.
   ``Industries are using the sky as a garbage dump to dispose of
hundreds of millions of pounds of unregulated cancer-causing
chemicals,'' said Deborah Sheiman, author of the report from the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
   The NRDC identified more than 1,500 companies in 46 states that
release substantial amounts of at least one of 13 cancer-causing
chemicals into the air. Thirty of the companies reported releasing
more than 1 million pounds of a particular carcinogen and several
had releases five to nine times that amount, the group said.
   While the EPA did not challenge the statistics, it stopped short
of attempting to estimate the health risks posed by such releases.
   Charles Elkins, director of the EPA's toxics programs, said the
raw figures cannot measure individuals' health risks because they do
not take into account exposure levels.
   A spokesman for one of the companies cited, Boeing Military
Airplanes of Wichita, Kan., said that while the company's Kansas
plant releases 2.3 million pounds of trichloroethylene, the releases
are so diluted ``the chemical is undetectable'' in the air.
   The spokesman, Richard Hill, said Boeing nevertheless is trying
to develop a substitute for the chemical.
   The Boeing plant ranked ninth among the biggest polluters cited
in the NRDC report. The most releases of any of the 13 carcinogens
examined came from the plants of Eastman Kodak Co., in Rochester,
N.Y. The company reported 8.9 million pounds of methylene chloride
were released during 1987, according to the EPA figures.
   Other companies which reported emissions of more than 2.5 million
pounds of the chemical, which the EPA has classified as a ``probable
human carcinogen,'' were GE Plastics of Mount Vernon, Ind.; the
Upjohn Co., Portage, Mich.; Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Clinton and Shadeland,
Ind.; and Hadco Corp., Derry, N.H.
   Peter Maas, an Upjohn spokesman, said today that the
pharmaceutical company is more than halfway toward its self-imposed
goal of cutting its 5 million pounds of emissions in half by the end
of 1989.
   Air sampling around the plant's perimeter in 1987 found no
detectable levels of methylene chloride, and within the plant the
chemical remains well below dangerous levels, he said.
   David Doniger, an NRDC attorney, acknowledged that the raw
figures provide no assessment of health risk to residents near the
plants, but maintained ``these pollutants have to be considered
dangerous at any level of exposure.''
   Only one of the 13 chemicals, benzene, is subject to any EPA
regulation covering routine industrial releases. The chemicals are
among the long list of toxic substances for which regulations are
being developed.
   In a separate development Monday, the EPA made public new details
about the release of the many toxic industrial pollutants _ not only
carcinogens _ into the air, providing for the first time a list of
counties where such releases are greatest.
   The agency said 68 million pounds of hazardous chemicals are
released into the air in 1987 in Tooele County, Utah, more than in
any other county in the country. The releases were attributed to
Amax Magnesium in Rowley, Utah.
   Other county ``hotspots'' for toxic industrial air pollution with
more than 45 million tons of hazardous chemical released were Warren
County in Virginia, Mobile County in Alabama and Ascension County in
Louisiana.
   The NRDC findings mirror many of the conclusions reached earlier
this month by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., after the congressman
compiled estimates on the release of carcinogens at industrial
plants from figures dating back to the early 1980s.
   But while Waxman's data from the EPA were based on ``rough
working estimates,'' the latest figures were based on actual release
numbers provided by the companies involved under a public disclosure
law that went into effect last year.
   Among the findings of the NRDC in its analysis of the EPA's
statistics were:
   _At least 1,600 industrial plants and facilities in 46 states
release significant amounts of suspected cancer-causing chemicals
into the air.
   _Releases of 400,000 pounds or more were reported by 125 plants,
including 30 that reported 1 million pounds or more.
   _The most common chemical among the 13 examined was methylene
chloride, used as a metal degreaser, paint remover and in aerosols.
It was cited at 18 of the 30 plants where releases exceeded 1
million pounds.
   The top polluter for each of the other 12 chemicals was:
Borg-Warner Chemical Inc., Washington, W.Va., acrylonitrile (1.14
million pounds); Texaco Chemical Co., Port Neches, Texas, 1,3
butadiene (960,000 pounds); Monsanto Co., Soda Spring, Idaho,
cadmium (100,250 pounds).
   Hercules Inc., Parlin, N.J., carbon tetrachloride (816,670
pounds); Westvaco, Bleached Board Div., Covington, Va., chloroform
(1.9 million pounds); Occidental Chemical, Castle Hayne, N.C.,
chromium (94,000 pounds); PPG Industries, Westlake, La., ethylene
dichloride (820,000 pounds).
   Shell Chemical, Geismar, La., ethylene oxide (594,000 pounds);
Aluminum Co. of America, Riverdale, Iowa, perchloroethylene (2.3
million pounds); Boeing Military Airplanes, Wichita, Kan.,
trichloroethylene (2.3 million pounds); Celanese Engineering Resin,
Nueces, Texas, formaldehyde (500,000 pounds); Inland Steel Corp.,
Lake, Ind., benzene (2.2 million pounds).

   Four Denver suburbs downstream from
Rocky Flats want the government to cover the cost of testing their
drinking water and stopping the flow of water from the weapons plant
into their reservoirs.
   Officials from Broomfield, Westminster, Thornton and Northglenn
met on Monday with Ed Goldberg, the Department of Energy's top
official at Rocky Flats, to press their concerns. The session was
organized by U.S. Rep. David Skaggs.
   ``Local governments shouldn't suffer any additional costs from
living downstream from Rocky Flats,'' said Skaggs, a Democrat.
   Goldberg noted that Skaggs and his congressional colleagues have
more say than he does over whether the suburbs get reimbursed.
   ``We can ask and we will ask, but it's up to Congress to
appropriate the money in the end,'' he said.
   Fears over the safety of the water surfaced earlier this month
with a U.S. Justice Department probe of alleged dumping of hazardous
wastes at Rocky Flats.
   Walnut and Woman creeks cross the site before entering the water
supplies of more than a quarter-million residents.
   Tests by the state and the four suburbs found no detectable
levels of pollutants in drinking water sources. But the suburbs said
they don't want to have to worry about the possibility of pollutants
flowing their way.
   Broomfield is digging a ditch to take Walnut Creek water around a
reservoir. A diversion of Woman Creek is under study. The creek
flows into a lake that provides drinking water to Westminster,
Thornton and Northglenn.

<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. has agreed to spend $92
million over five years to curb toxic releases from a plant that has
piled up $150,000 in pollution fines over the past year.
   The agreement, announced Monday, expands on a $15.2 million air
pollution cleanup promised by the steelmaker in 1987.
   Officials said that the agreement, the largest ever negotiated by
the state with an industrial polluter, is legally binding and that
Bethlehem could be fined more than $100,000 for failing to maintain
the cleanup schedule.
   Bethlehem Steel's Sparrows Point complex at Baltimore Harbor
employs 8,000 workers and produces steel for ships, bridges,
buildings, autos and appliances.
   The plant is the third-largest source of cancer-causing chemicals
in Maryland and one of the state's leading industrial sources of
sulfur dioxide emissions, which have taken the principal blame for
acid rain.
   Buoyed by its first profitable year since 1981, Bethlehem pledged
in 1987 to reduce emissions. The new agreement calls for more
extensive measures, including a $40 million modernization of a
chemical recovery plant to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and
toxic pollutants, mainly benzene and hydrogen cyanide.
   Benzene can cause leukemia and other cancers, anemia and other
health problems. Hydrogen cyanide can kill if inhaled in high
concentrations.
   Bethlehem also promised to repair leaking walls and flues at a
cost of $24 million to cut down on the black smoke belching from
three smokestacks.
   By 1994, the cleanup should result in reductions of 54 percent in
particulates, 67 percent in sulfur dioxide, 50 percent in volatile
organic compounds that create ozone, and 30 percent in benzene,
officials said.

   A school that has straddled the Indiana-Ohio
border for nearly 100 years, a center stripe in the gymnasium
marking the state line, must continue to accept students from both
states, a U.S. magistrate said.
   Magistrate Michael Merz on Monday blocked an attempt by Indiana
officials to close Union School to Ohio students and force them to
attend another school miles from home.
   Merz's preliminary injunction forces the Union County (Ind.)
School Corp. to abide by a 1964 court order that bars it from
altering operation of the school with the College Corner (Ohio)
school board without consent of both boards.
   ``While the joint operation may be cumbersome, it is not
impossibly so and has worked for almost 100 years,'' Merz wrote.
``It is needed to provide a school for the children of College
Corner. It is needed to uphold the obligation of defendants to obey
their own solemn undertakings and the judgment of this court.''
   The school was built by the Ohio and Indiana districts so that
children from either state could attend.
   Last week, Richard Amick, superintendent of the Union County
corporation, said the Indiana board has voted to sever its
relationship with the College Corner board because of conflicting
state laws that jeopardize state money for Indiana students. He also
cited a poor relationship with members of the College Corner board.
   About 280 Indiana students attend Union School, comprising about
75 percent of the enrollment.
   College Corner officials say that without the arrangement, Ohio
pupils will be forced to attend school miles away because the
community doesn't have enough students to operate its own school.

   Phone paging companies, their images bruised by
drug dealers' incessant use of beepers, are bopping those beeped the
most.
   Nynex said Monday it will join other companies in levying a
surcharge on customers who use their beepers an inordinate number of
times _ often a tipoff they're drug dealers.
   ``It's part of an industry-wide reaction to the perception that
the paging industry is tainted by the fact that a few bad guys are
using pagers,'' said Michael Vernetti, spokesman for Telocator, a
Washington-based trade association.
   Dealers went high-tech a few years ago to meet the high demand
for crack, authorities said. Now the beleaguered beeper has become a
symbol of drug dealing, a piece of electronic jewelry.
   When police make a bust, they often find guns, cash, drugs _ and
beepers.
   ``The pager is nothing but a tool, the same tool that can reach a
doctor and help save a person's life,'' said Don Kilcoyne, spokesman
for Nynex Mobile Communications.
   The companies can't do much about those who buy or lease beepers,
except make an identification and credit check. So they're hitting
drug dealers at the other end _ the monthly bill, in the form of a
surcharge.
   ``We feel it's had a positive effect,'' said Chris Houpis,
marketing director of Metromedia Paging Services, which has charged
$1 per beep over 1,000 a month since last fall.
   Metromedia said it will donate the surcharge to the Target
Foundation, a Missouri-based drug-counseling organization. The
amount won't be known until later this year, Houpis said.
   Starting Aug. 1, Nynex will charge 50 cents per beep over 500 a
month and $1 for each over 1,000. AllCity Paging of Tarzana, Calif.,
also added a surcharge last year.
   Long Island Telephone may have started the trend.
   ``Way back in '87 our system was getting very crowded, we had
very heavy usage _ drug dealers, naturally,'' Rose Marie Marchiel,
the company's sales coordinator, said Monday. The company charged 15
cents for each beep over 350 a month.
   ``It did lighten it up again, to where the other customers
weren't getting busy signals,'' she said.
   Police say regular drug customers call the dealer's number and
punch in their number. The dealer calls back and arrangements for a
sale are made.
   Mrs. Marchiel said customers would ``come in with 25 pounds of
gold jewelry, the stereotype. We can't accuse them of anything. We
saw more and more, and their friends brought in friends.''
   The company figures the surcharge eliminated about 35 percent of
the ``problem users.'' Customers involved in law enforcement and
public health and safety are exempted from the surcharge, she said.
   Will it hurt the dealers?
   ``It might hurt some of the lower-level dealers, but not the
higher-ups,'' said a New York City narcotics officer who spoke on
the condition on anonymity. ``They just won't pay their bill, and
get another beeper.''
   Beepers have been banned in schools in several major cities,
including New York, Chicago, Detroit and Baltimore, in an attempt to
keep schoolchildren from being involved in drug sales. Rep. Kweisi
Mfume, D-Md., has introduced the Beeper Abuse Prevention Act, which
would restrict access to pagers to those under 21.

<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, faced
with increasing civil violence, reimposed a nationwide state of
emergency today less than six months after he had lifted it.
   Foreign and Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told
Parliament that Premadasa had proclaimed the state of emergency to
try to control unrest that is believed caused by Sinhalese
extremists.
   The emergency, which became effective immediately, is to last for
one month and then be extended by Parliament every month.
   Emergency regulations give police and the military broad powers
to arrest and hold suspects without warrants or other judicial
requirements. Authorities also can dispose of bodies without
inquests.
   Sinhalese extremists, mostly belonging to the left-wing People's
Liberation Front, are believed to have led a crippling 8-day-old
strike by workers of the state-owned public transport company.
   The strike by 20,000 workers of the Sri Lanka Transport Board has
often turned violent and has forced more than 4,000 buses off the
road.
   ``Public services, including transport, have been paralyzed by
forcing the workers to keep away from work,'' Wijeratne said.
   Strike sponsors have threatened private bus and taxi drivers and
last week set ablaze 15 buses, police said.
   Since it began an anti-government campaign in 1987, the Sinhalese
front has been blamed for killing more than 3,500 people, most of
whom were government officials or governing party activists.
   Wijeratne, without naming the extremists, said more than 1,700
people have been killed since January, of whom 965 were politicians,
government officials and policemen.
   ``There has been progressive escalation of violence, acts of
sabotage and disruption of essential services throughout the
country,'' he said. ``Under such a situation, the government cannot
look on inactively.''
   The Sinhalese militants launched their anti-government drive to
protest peace overtures made to rebels of the Tamil community, who
have been fighting for an independent nation since 1983.
   The insurrection forced Premadasa's predecessor, Junius R.
Jayewardene, to declare a state of emergency in May 1983. Premadasa
lifted the emergency on Jan 11, nine days after he took office, in a
bid to defuse ethnic tensions. He had pledged it would not be
imposed again.
   The Tamil separatist campaign has claimed 9,000 lives. Tamils say
they are discriminated against in jobs and education by the majority
Buddhist Sinhalese.
   Tamils, mostly Hindus, form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people. The mainly Buddhist Sinhalese comprise 75 percent and
control the government and the military.

   A Soviet ocean liner with more than 950
people aboard rammed an iceberg in arctic seas and took on water
today, but all passengers were evacuated. Some crew members stayed
aboard to try to keep the ship afloat.
   A Norwegian coast guard vessel and helicopters rescued passengers
from the 630-foot Maxim Gorky and others who already had fled to
lifeboats and ice floes. Most of the passengers are Western European
vacationers.
   The cruise ship radioed northern Norway's Rescue Coordination
Center at 12:27 a.m. that it was listing after hitting an iceberg
about 300 miles east of northern Greenland, a coast guard spokesman
said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the accident occurred in fog.
   Norwegian and Soviet officials reported no injuries in the
collision. Finn B. Hansen of the Rescue Coordination Center said the
coast guard vessel arrived at 4:15 a.m. and all passengers were
rescued by about 7:30 a.m.
   Passengers said the evacuation was orderly.
   ``There was no panic at all,'' said West Germany passenger
Winfried Prince. ``The Russian crew has worked perfectly in
disembarking passengers into lifeboats, and also the Norwegians who
picked us up ... have done a wonderful job, so nobody has been hurt
or even worse,'' Prince told NBC's ``Today'' show in a
radio-telephone interview from a rescue ship.
   Hansen said the ship was apparently saved from sinking by new
pumps brought by a Soviet tugboat and a Norwegian helicopter after
others broke down. ``It looks like there is enough new pumping
equipment aboard to keep it afloat,'' he said.
   The commander of the coast guard boat Senja, Sigurd Kleiven, said
253 crewmen were being kept on board the Maxim Gorky. About 120
crewmen were rescued.
   The Senja reached the stricken ship early today and picked up
hundreds of passengers who had jumped into lifeboats or scrambled
onto ice floes in near-freezing temperatures and light rain, said
Kjell Larssen of the north Norway Rescue Center at Bodoe. Others
were rescued by helicopter from the ship or ice floes.
   Norwegian officials and the Lloyds insurance company of London
said none of the passengers were missing or injured.
   The German travel agency Phoenix Flugreisen of Bonn, which
managed the cruise, said said 551 Germans and 16 other west
Europeans were aboard and that a plane will be sent to pick them up.
   The Norwegian news agency said the passengers were from West
Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Britain, Italy, Switzerland and
Sweden.
   Tass quoted Vladimir Nekhoroshev, chief inspector for the
Ministry of the Sea Fleet, as saying 575 tourists and 377 crew
members were on board.
   The rescue center said it had received conflicting figures, but
said there were 379 crew members.
   The liner was 185 miles west of the Norway's Spitsbergen
archipelago.
   Rescue efforts were aided by the 24-hour summer daylight of the
Arctic.
   Several other Soviet and Norwegian boats were within 300 miles of
the cruise liner.
   Norwegian helicopters ferried rescued passengers from the Senja's
deck to Longyearbyen, the adminstrative center on Svalbard island,
the largest in the Spitsbergen archipelago. Airplanes were picking
them up and taking them on to the Norwegian mainland.
   The liner had originated in Bremerhaven, West Germany. It cruised
to Iceland and was to pass the Spitsbergen islands before making its
way south along the Norwegian coast on its way home, the Norwegian
news agency NTB said.
   The Maxim Gorky was built in 1969 and sold to the Soviet Union in
1974. In recent summers, it has carried mostly West Germans on tours
from Hamburg arranged by German tour operator NUR.
   The ship was crippled a few hundred miles north of where a Soviet
nuclear submarine caught fire and sank on April 7. More than 40
sailors died in that accident.
   There have been a series of recent accidents on Soviet cruise
ships.
   In February 1986, the liner Mikhail Lermontov sank off of New
Zealand after striking a reef. Of the 739 passengers and crew
aboard, all but one crew member were rescued.
   In August of that year the cruise ship Admiral Nakhimov collided
with a freighter in the Black Sea and sank, killing several hundred
Soviet tourists.
   A fire aboard the cruise ship Priamurye while it was docked in
Osaka, Japan, in May 1988 claimed the lives of 11 Soviet tourists.

   Cities and states should look to tolls,
fees and lotteries to finance roads and bridges because of the
federal government's budget problems, Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner told mayors today.
   Skinner told the U.S. Conference of Mayors that local governments
can no longer count on Washington for most of its transportation
investments.
   He said lotteries, toll roads and bridges, user fees and fees
charged to developers are ``new, creative ways'' that state and
local governments are turning to.
   Skinner said federal transportation grants will increasingly be
awarded to areas that offer to put up more local money than the 20
percent or 25 percent many federal programs require.
   ``If you don't have 50 percent or better state and local
participation ... that grant will be so far down the priority list
it will not be reached,'' he said.
   On Monday, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp told
the mayors he had taken partisanship out of funding decisions at his
scandal-ridden department.
   ``Democrats and Republicans need to read my lips _ it's open to
everybody on the basis of need as opposed to greed, as it existed in
the past,'' Kemp told the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Monday.
   ``I will clean it up. I will clean it out.''
   The more than 200 mayors from both parties were continuing their
five-day meeting today, with appearances by more Bush administration
officials and Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown. The conference
concludes Wednesday.
   Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly also was
scheduled to appear today.
   In prepared remarks, Reilly urged support for President Bush's
clean air act proposal and said merely offering it was ``an act of
great political courage.''
   ``The president is walking head-on into one of our thorniest
political briar patches,'' Reilly said.
   Bush's proposal is aimed at breaking a decade-long congressional
stalemate that has blocked enactment of tougher federal clean air
laws. It calls for a 50 percent, 10 million ton reduction in sulfur
dioxide emissions, a chief cause of acid rain, from coal burning
power plants. Other measures are aimed at smog and ozone problems,
including a phase-in of cars powered by methanol.
   The proposal marks a break from the Reagan administration, which
did not acknowledge acid rain as an environmental concern and
opposed tougher laws to curb smog.
   Kemp was greeted warmly, in contrast to an earlier appearance by
Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater. Atwater's sharply partisan
remarks, including his pledge to work actively for GOP mayoral
candidates and reference to the mayors as the ``farm team'' of the
party, drew complaints from mayors in both parties.
   Kemp repeated his recent promise to crack down on mismanagement
and fraud in the department and eliminate political influence from
decision-making on federal grants. HUD has been beset by a series of
scandals, including the embezzlement of millions of dollars and
charges that well-connected Republicans used influence peddling to
steer the awarding of HUD grants.
   He said reforms would not interfere with his goals, including
establishing urban enterprise zones that are aimed at luring jobs to
the ghettos, allowing public housing tenants to manage and purchase
their residences, and fighting drugs.
   Kemp declined, however, to say whether former HUD Secretary
Samuel Pierce, who served throughout the Reagan administration, must
shoulder blame for the problems being uncovered.
   ``I'm not going to make a political judgment about any past
secretary because I think it's unseemly of me,'' he said.
   Kemp said he was ``confident I understand the scope'' of the
scandals at HUD.
   ``I don't think it's as bad as the critics say. I don't think
it's as good as I want it to be,'' he said.

   Three Palestinians said they met a Jewish
settler who was hiking in the occupied West Bank, chatted with him,
posed for a picture and then stabbed him to death, Israeli officials
said today.
   The men were arrested during the night by agents of the Shin Bet
security service in the death Saturday of Frederick Steven
Rosenfeld, 48, of the West Bank settlement of Ariel, the officials
said. They insisted on anonymity.
   Shortly after Rosenfeld's funeral service in Ariel, a settler
opened fire with an Uzi submachine gun on a group of Arabs waiting
at major intersection near Tel Aviv, said police spokeswoman Dalia
Gilad.
   Two Palestinians were wounded, one of them seriously, she said.
The assailant was apprehended after being chased by police and
residents. Police had no motive for the attack.
   The army blew up the homes of the suspects in Rosenfeld's
slaying, who are from the nearby village of Burkin, Israel radio
said. Their names were not released.
   Also today, Fahad Fawzi Madi, a 27-year-old Palestinian suspected
of collaborating with Israel, was found beaten and stabbed to death
in the town of Khan Yunis in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab and
Israeli news reports said.
   Another Palestinian, Samir Mohammed Antiz, 19, was found dead in
his tent at the Ketziot detention center in the Negev desert, where
he had been held without charge since February, an army spokesman
said.
   Israel radio said Antiz apparently was killed by fellow prisoners
who accused him of collaborating with the authorities.
   The army said police were investigating Madi's death and checking
reports on Antiz's death.
   Also, a 34-year-old Palestinian postal worker from the West Bank
town of Jenin was hospitalized with two broken legs and a broken arm
after he was beaten by masked Arabs who suspected him of
collaborating with Israel, Arab reports said.
   More than 50 Palestinians suspected of cooperating with Israeli
authorities have been killed since the start of the 18-month
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied lands.
   The deaths raised to at least 526 the number of Palestinians
killed since the revolt began. Twenty-three Israelis also have died.
   The three Palestinians accused of slaying Rosenfeld came upon the
settler Saturday while he was hiking on a barren hillside near the
Arab village of Burkin, about three miles from Ariel, the security
officials said.
   They said the Arabs, who are from Burkin, told agents during
interrogation that Rosenfeld chatted with them, took their pictures
with his camera, and asked them to take a photograph of him.
   One of them then grabbed Rosenfeld's knife and stabbed him in the
back, said the official.
   They said the three Arabs were taken to the scene today to
re-enact the slaying.
   Other Palestinian shepherds found Rosenfeld's body Sunday
morning. An empty pistol holster, two spent cartridges, a map and
binoculars were found near the body.
   There was no explanation of how the settler's gun might have been
fired.
   According to Ariel settlers, Rosenfeld was a nature lover and
apparently was mapping a hiking route for residents when he was
killed. Rosenfeld, who was raised in Washington, D.C., came to
Israel in 1968 and had lived in Ariel for 18 months. He was not
married.
   About 70,000 Jews live in 131 settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, alongside 1.7 million Palestinians. Relations between
the two groups have worsened since the start of the uprising.
   Rosenfeld's death provoked public protests in Jerusalem, Tel
Aviv, and the West Bank and calls from right-wing legislators for
harsher measures to quell the Palestinian revolt.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vowed Monday to ``uproot the
violence with an iron fist.''
   In other developments, troops used bulldozers to demolish two
houses of Palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs at military
patrols in the West Bank town of Qalqilya, army radio said.
   In Gaza City, military authorities fired the director of the
Israeli-run Shifa Hospital, accusing him of belonging to the
mainstream Fatah faction of the outlawed PLO and of maintaining
contacts with Fatah leaders in Jordan.
   Dr. Ahmed Al Yazgi denied the accusations, the Jerusalem Post
reported. Yazgi was quoted as saying he believed his activities with
Israeli peace activists had angered Israeli authorities.

   A judge today put off until Thursday a hearing
on Pete Rose's request to stop Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett
Giamatti from deciding whether to ban the Cincinnati Reds manager
from the sport.
   After a hearing in his chambers, Common Pleas Judge Norbert Nadel
also said the commissioner's office agreed not to take action
against Rose until at least Sunday.
   Rose sued on Monday to block Giamatti from holding a hearing on
allegations of gambling June 26. The ballplayer contended he was
being judged by a ``prejudiced commissioner.''
   The lawsuit also confirmed for the first time that Ronald Peters,
who claims he is Rose's former bookmaker, accused Rose of betting on
Reds games. If the allegations prove true, Giamatti could ban Rose
from baseball for life.
   Giamatti said in a statement Monday that his lawyers had reviewed
the court papers ``advised me that Mr. Rose's lawsuit is wholly
without merit.''
   ``I trust the court will permit me to proceed with my hearing,''
he said.

   A man who walked into a police station to
ask about a career in law enforcement was arrested for allegedly
robbing a convenience store a few minutes earlier.
   A police dispatcher took a call about a robbery only a few blocks
away as she chatted with David Ferrell Marshall, 25.
   While police gathered information on the robbery, Marshall was
referred to Chief Dan Thies to discuss his qualifications.
   As he spoke with Marshall, Thies received a phone call from a
lieutenant with a description of the robbery suspect. The suspect
wore a pair of pink-and-gray shorts matching those worn by Marshall.
   ``The lieutenant on the phone says, `Does that look familiar to
you?' and I'm sitting here looking at the guy,'' Thies recalled
Monday.
   He escorted Marshall to the lobby as the store clerk was brought
into the station.
   ``That's him,'' she said, pointing to Marshall.
   Marshall was arrested on a charge of strong-armed robbery and
violation of probation. He was held in the Putnam County Jail.
   ``I didn't give him an application,'' Thies said.

   Carl Loe watched his spearfishing partner
shoot a 150-pound shark, and then felt the heavy jaws of a second
shark clamp onto his leg.
   ``When I turned and looked, there was nothing but teeth embedded
in my leg,'' the 45-year-old furniture retailer said Monday from
Ochsner Foundation Hospitals, where he has been hospitalized since
Saturday.
   Loe, of Slidell, was more than 100 feet underwater in the Gulf of
Mexico and 40 miles off the coast at Cocodrie, southwest of New
Orleans, when the 6-foot shark attacked.
   Loe said he spotted a sand tiger shark and swam out of the way to
let his partner, Arthur Bukasky, get off a shot with his speargun.
   That shark fled, pulling Bukasky away, and then Loe was attacked
by another 6-foot sand tiger.
   He felt and saw the shark's jaws open and close again, mauling
his right leg and cutting his left.
   ``My only reaction was to punch him in the nose and get him
off,'' said Loe.
   He slammed the butt of his speargun into the shark's nose until
it let go. Then he swam to the surface where Carl Loe III, 15,
worked to stop the bleeding and radioed for help.
   A helicopter took Loe from the boat to Ochsner.
   Loe said his leg was punctured and cut in dozens of places, but
doctors tell him he should recover fully.
   He said the attack won't stop his spearfishing. Shark attacks
``are so rare and so extreme I don't think it's going to keep me
from diving,'' he said. ``I may be quite a bit more cautious from
now on.''

   Hollywood hopefuls duped into sending
photographs to a prison will get them back, along with a letter of
apology from the inmate who conducted a movie-recruitment scheme
from his cell, a prison investigator said.
   The scheme came to light two weeks ago when authorities in
southwest Alabama warned residents that telephone calls about a
possible filming by Paramount Pictures were untrue.
   The calls were made by inmate James Mills, said Bill Dury, a
prison investigator at Staunton Correctional Center in Staunton, Va.
Mills, 29, is serving nine years there for attempted larceny.
   ``He admitted the whole thing,'' Dury said in a telephone
interview Monday. ``I think it was kind of an ego-satisfying thing
to have these beautiful young women sending photographs to him.''
   Mills called high school students in Alabama, West Virginia,
South Carolina and Arizona about being in a movie, Dury said.
Inmates routinely are allowed only collect phone calls; Dury
declined to say how Mills bypassed the prison's phone system.
   The Hollywood hopefuls mailed photos of themselves to Mills, who
used several aliases, Dury said. A search of his cell last week
recovered 15 or 20 photos from six or seven people. None of the
subjects was nude.
   Mills had tried, however, to obtain nude photos of students,
Mobile County investigators said last week.
   Dury said there was no evidence that Mills was selling or trading
the photos. He described the photos as portrait-type pictures from
high school.
   ``One family did send photographs in bikinis. It appeared to be
an older woman and two young girls,'' Dury said.
   No charges were immediately filed against Mills, Dury said.
Mobile County authorities asked federal officials to investigate,
since the scheme crossed state lines.

<HEAD>Park Pulls Together a Fire Exhibit to Meet Public Interest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yellowstone has added an
exhibit on the devastating fires of 1988, intended to help visitors
drive through the park's charred areas _ as well as the unscarred
half _ with more understanding.
   ``I hope people will learn enough to have a choice of what they
think,'' said Betty Knight, a park naturalist. ``They still might be
mad, but that's their choice.''
   Knight directed planning and construction of the exhibit, which
opened Saturday in the visitors center at Grant Village.
   The $136,000 production was an unusual crash program for the
National Park Service, which usually requires at least two years of
planning on a major exhibit, she said.
   The motivation was an unprecedented public interest, Knight said.
   ``It was a Vietnam of forest fires,'' she said. ``It was the
first time fire was brought into people's living rooms on a steady
basis.''
   The exhibit, she said, shows the short-term effects of the fires,
from five to 25 years from now, and explores the long-range future
of Yellowstone.
   The causes _ drought, lightning storms, the park's geography _
are explained, as well as recent history of fire supression that
contributed to the build-up of fuel.
   The exhibit includes murals, portraits of firefighters, a video
recouting the fury of the fires and presentations about animals.
   Grant Village survived a seige of fire in late July, although
fast-running flames came within feet of staff dormitories. Now the
area is an almost surreal scene: blackened trees interspersed with
orange lodgepole pines that are dead but still have their needles.
   Except in the badly charred stands, there is a lush carpet of
green grass growing through the soot and ash. And to the north and
east, around Yellowstone Lake, there is no evidence of the fires
that swept through half the 2.2 million acre park.
   Knight, 44, typifies those who believe the fires were, in
historical terms, good for the country's first national park, with
long-term benefits for vegetation and wildlife.
   The exhibit does not, however, address the decision to allow many
fires to burn naturally until late July, or refer to disputes
between firefighters and park rangers that hampered some efforts to
quell the flames until it was too late.
   ``We're not touching policy,'' said Knight, who has been with the
park service for 22 years. ``We're trying to get across that all of
Yellowstone is not the same, that it won't recover the same.''
   The exhibit she coordinated will take most visitors about 20
minutes to tour, although Knight said there is enough information
available for extremely interested tourists to spend more than two
hours.
   Design costs ran $16,000 and production $120,000, Knight said,
not including the salaries and overtime required.
   The exhibit closes with writings by Bob Marshall, a
conservationist who remarked in 1927 that in fire-blackened forests,
``There were some scenes of desolation that pretty nearly drive an
unimaginative person crazy.''
   Marshall concluded that ``an optimist could go surging through
that blackened, misshapened world rejoicing because the forest will
look just as beautiful as before _ in two or three centuries.''
   Knight, like most other park employees, takes Marshall's view.
   ``It's always a changing park,'' she said. ``It wasn't the same
park in 1988 as it was in 1953 when I first saw it.
   ``The difference, obviously, is that this change is much more
dramatic.''

   President Bush paid tribute today to the
National Basketball Association champion Detroit Pistons, saying
their ``brand of bump and run basketball is a winner.''
   In a White House ceremony driven indoors by rain, Bush joked
about the reputation of the Pistons as the ``Bad Boys'' of the NBA.
   ``Someone once said basketball is ballet with a blackboard.
Whoever it was definitely wasn't under the boards with (Bill)
Laimbeer and (Rick) Mahorn. When the shot goes up there I would not
liken that to Swan Lake,'' he said.
   ``But your brand of bump and run basketball is a winner and I
know that your aggressive style has given the Pistons something of a
reputation.''
   But citing their charity work for the Special Olympics, muscular
dystrophy and other causes, Bush said, ``You may be to some the bad
side of basketball, but off the court people see the kinder, gentler
side of the Detroit Pistons.''
   Guard Isiah Thomas and team owner Bill Davidson presented a
basketball to the president.
   Several dozen excited children from the District of Columbia
Police Boys' and Girls' Clubs also got in to see the new NBA champs,
who dethroned the Los Angeles Lakers in a four-game sweep.

   Iranian Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani met
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today during an official visit
designed to strengthen ties between the nations.
   Rafsanjani, also acting commander-in-chief or the armed forces,
is the highest-ranking official of the Islamic Republic to visit its
northern neighbor since the 1979 Islamic revolution. He also is
expected to seek military aid.
   He was greeted by Gorbachev on his arrival today at the Grand
Kremlin Palace and the two leaders promptly adjourned to the ornate
crystal-lit St. Catherine's Hall for discussions, the official Tass
news agency said.
   ``In the Soviet Union there is confidence that the visit by
Rafsanjani will give fresh impetus to the continued progress of
Soviet-Iranian relations ... and will help improve mutual
understanding and strengthen cooperation between the two
countries,'' it said.
   Tass said the Soviet Union was intent on developing strong
relations with Iran ``despite essential ideological differences
between the two countries.''
   Relations ``have grown especially strong lately,'' it said,
crediting the late Ayatollah Khomeini for the improvement. Khomeini,
the fundamentalist leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, died on June
3.
   Before leaving Tehran, Rafsanjani expressed hope that the visit,
delayed since last fall, would open ``a new chapter in
Iranian-Soviet relations and in the history of the region,'' said
the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   On his return Rafsanjani is to stop in Hungary and Bulgaria to
complete 10-year cooperation agreements that include aid to Iran's
growing arms industry.
   Rafsanjani was accompanied by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati, Commander of the Revolutionary Guards Corps Mohsen Rezaie,
Minister of Heavy Industries Behzad Nabavi, representatives of seven
other ministries and a number of parliamentary deputies, IRNA said.
   Mohammad Javad Iravani, minister of economic and financial
affairs, preceded him to Moscow to complete the groundwork for
signing a number of agreements, IRNA said.
   Iran officially has a non-aligned foreign policy, but Rafsanjani
said soon after Khomeini died that Iran's spiritual leader had told
him to press ahead with improving ties with Moscow.
   With ties to the West still strained, Iran is looking to the
Soviet bloc for help in rebuilding Iran following its eight-year war
with Iraq.
   Relations between the two countries soured soon after the Iranian
revolution with the Soviet intervention in neighboring Afghanistan
and the 1981 Iranian repression of the Tudeh Communist party.
   The Soviet Union was one of Iraq's major arms suppliers in the
Iran-Iraq war that ended in a tentative truce in August.
   Iranian-Soviet relations improved with the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan. In January, Khomeini appealed to Gorbachev to look to
Islam for the solution to the Soviet Union's political and economic
stagnation.

<HEAD>The Price of Pluralism: Cleaning Up From Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With an exuberance matched only by the
novelty of their new democratic parliamentary elections, Poles
plastered campaign posters across the country over the last month.
   Now the time has come to pay the price of pluralism: cleaning up.
   With the signs of Poland's fledgling venture into free elections
looking a bit tattered, the question remains: Who should scrub,
scrape and wash away the campaign posters, and who should pay for it?
   An estimated 700,000 posters went up in Warsaw alone in an
astounding display of uncensored campaigning unseen in Poland during
45 years of communist rule.
   That represented about 40 tons of paper, a significant amount in
a country where university students sometimes don't have anything
suitable on which to type their theses.
   Most of the posters came from the independent Solidarity
movement, which went on to win all but one of the 261 seats
available to opposition candidates and hand the government a
stinging rebuke in two rounds of voting that started June 4 and
ended Sunday.
   Now, however, the posters such as those featuring gallant Gary
Cooper in cowboy gear and a Solidarity button that says, ``High noon
is June 4,'' are peeling off apartment block walls.
   Rain has smeared the sentiments of support for a communist
coalition candidate whose banner hung along a main city thoroughfare.
   ``The emotions subsided, the litter remained ... Who is going to
clean it up?'' asked the daily Solidarity newspaper.
   Jan Litynski, head of the Solidarity campaign in Warsaw, promised
in the article that the union would work on the cleanup with city
authorities.
   ``But we do not have the money to hire people. We have only
debts,'' Litynski said. ``So those who were putting up the posters
for free now will to clean them off, too.''
   Another issue of the newspaper carried a call from 12-year-old
Mikolaj Bober, who put up posters all over the Zoliborz section of
Warsaw.
   ``We have to clean it up,'' he said. ``I am eager to do this ...
and I count on the help of other boys and girls.''
   The director of the Warsaw municipal cleaning enterprise, Leszek
Swierczynski, said the city will clean the sites it administers, but
building janitors, the bus and tramway services and others will have
to take care of their areas.
   ``There is quite a lot to do ... and the whole (cleanup) campaign
will surely take a lot of extra money,'' said Swierczynski, making
it clear that the expenses of Western-style electioneering were not
anticipated in his department's budget.
   ``The scale of the poster phenomenon in Warsaw is
extraordinary,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   Wednesday is the summer solstice, the longest
day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.
   The solstice occurs at 5:53 a.m. EDT, according to astronomers at
the U.S. Naval Observatory here. The moment marks the time during
the summer when the sun is farthest from the equator.
   The date, known in folklore as Midsummer, had been a time for
parties and frivolity to celebrate the season.
   Listing the date as the start of summer has become a popular
convention among calendar makers in recent years, but the
designation carries no official weight. Meteorologists, for example,
consider summer to have begun June 1.

<HEAD>Former Rep. Swindall Convicted of Perjury</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Pat Swindall was convicted of nine
counts of perjury today for lying to a federal grand jury about a
money-laundering scheme.
   The 38-year-old Republican, who served two terms in Congress from
Atlanta's suburbs before being defeated in November, could receive
up to five years in prison plus fines of $250,000 on each count at
sentencing Aug. 25.
   The jury deliberated 17 hours over four days after nearly four
weeks of testimony. Swindall was indicted in October on 10 counts of
perjury. U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman dismissed one count
during the trial.
   The former congressman was accused of lying to a grand jury in
1988 about his 1987 negotiations with an IRS agent posing as a
drug-money launderer and with Swindall associate Charles LeChasney,
later convicted of money laundering.
   Among other things, Swindall was found guilty of perjury for
denying that he had been told that the $850,000 he was seeking from
the agent to finish building his luxurious home contained proceeds
from drug trafficking.
   Swindall looked on impassively as the verdict was read, his
wife's hand on his back.
   At a news conference, he said he was confident he would be
vindicated on appeal _ ``not vindicated in the sense that I did no
wrong, but vindicated in the sense that I never perjured myself
before the grand jury.''
   His chief attorney, Richard Hendrix, said Swindall, who did not
take the stand at trial, will appeal.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said, ``The jury has very obviously
spoken today. ... (Swindall) violated the integrity of the grand
jury process.''
   Swindall, a lanky, boyish lawyer, went to Congress in 1984 from
the city's affluent eastern suburbs as a conservative,
fundamentalist Christian. Under the cloud of the perjury indictment,
he lost to Democrat Ben Jones, a former TV actor from ``The Dukes of
Hazzard.''
   The jury heard secretly taped conversations with the undercover
agent, Mike Mullaney, in which Swindall was told that the $850,000
``certainly'' included drug money and that he would be part of an
operation to ``wash'' cash. Swindall proposed that a mortgage
company be set up by LeChasney as a ``buffer'' to allow him to
``borrow'' the agent's money.
   In their last conversation, after Swindall had received a
$150,000 advance, he told Mullaney, ``If Charles wants to launder
y'all's money, fine. But I can't do that. ... I can borrow the money
from Charles.''
   Later, Swindall told a federal grand jury he was ``never
satisfied ... with respect to (the deal's) criminality'' and knew
almost nothing about LeChasney's mortgage company.
   The deal never was completed. Swindall was to have received
$850,000 in exchange for a $1 million promissory note.
   Swindall's lawyers insisted that he had been duped by a man he
assumed was his friend _ LeChasney, whom they labeled a
``sociopathic liar'' and ``master manipulator'' who assured Swindall
that the deal was OK.
   Hendrix said the former congressman was guilty of ``stupidity''
but not perjury. He said Swindall was fatigued at the time of his
grand jury testimony and tried faithfully to recall details from
months gone by.
   ``He never laundered a dime. He did the best he could when he got
in front of the grand jury,'' Hendrix said.
   But Prosecutor Cragi Gillen scoffed at the ``I don't remember''
and ``I don't recall'' phrases that peppered Swindall's grand jury
testimony.
   ``Do you think you would remember,'' Gillen asked the jury, ``if
you took a walk with a man you believed to be a criminal ... and he
tells you narcotics dollars are involved ... what he does violates
currency laws?
   ``Do you think you could ever forget?''
   The prosecution called a surprise witness, money-laundering
conspirator Kirk Smith, who testified that Swindall had told him
last fall _ before the congressman was indicted _ how he planned to
beat the perjury rap.
   Smith recalled: ``He looked at me and said, `Kirk, I'm a lawyer.
In front of the grand jury, I used phrases like ``I don't remember''
and ``I can't recall.'' They can't convict me for having a bad
memory.'''
   Swindall was a largely unknown lawyer and furniture store owner
when he was elected in an upset in 1984, toppling veteran Democrat
Elliott Levitas.
   Swindall, a Presbyterian, took his campaign to evangelical
churches, distributing a ``Biblical Scorecard'' in his race against
Levitas, who is Jewish.
   In his two terms, Swindall staunchly voted with the Reagan right
and acquired a reputation as somewhat of a gadfly, voting against
such popular programs as school lunch funding and aid to African
famine victims. He filed a brief with the Supreme Court advocating
the teaching of ``creationism'' in schools.
   After his indictment, Swindall hoped to clear his name by
Election Day with an immediate trial, but the effort collapsed after
jurors received Swindall campaign mail proclaiming his innocence.
The judge aborted the trial.
   Two weeks later, Jones won by 20 percentage points.

   A driver who caused a three-car collision
did not have a license to show a sheriff's deputy and now he won't
be eligible for one until the year 2003.
   That's when Justin Aronson turns 16.
   The 2{-year-old boy drove his battery-powered toy car onto a
suburban road Sunday and triggered a collision by drivers in
adult-sized cars who tried to avoid him, said Clackamas County
sheriff's deputy Michael F. Helmstadt.
   Two cars and a small pickup truck were damaged but no one was
hurt, Helmstadt said.
   Justin's father, Daniel, said Justin drove off in his toy car
while he was cleaning the family's garage. The father said he found
Justin just after the accident and took the boy and his toy car home.
   Helmstedt wrote in his report that he interviewed everybody
involved in the accident except for Justin. ``He couldn't talk
yet,'' Helmstedt noted.

   China's official media announced more arrests of
demonstrators today and Premier Li Peng said many more people must
be rounded up and punished to prevent dissidents ``from making a
comeback.''
   New regulations went into effect today that appear designed to
prevent people wanted by the government from fleeing the country.
Officials in the Philippines today announced that 18 Chinese
refugees had arrived there by boat and asked for asylum because of
the turmoil.
   The Supreme Court today issued orders to all lower courts to
``severely punish counterrevolutionary elements who have been
charged.''
   The People's Broadcasting radio station quoted the court as
saying it was important that those who incited social unrest or
participated in riots be dealt with swiftly.
   In Washington, the United States has urged China to grant
clemency to 11 pro-democracy demonstrators sentenced to death and to
pardon those who were arrested in protests. White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater today declined to say what, if any, steps
the United States might take if China goes ahead with executions.
   More than 1,360 people have been reported arrested since
demonstrations broke out in cities across China to protest the
army's killing of hundreds of unarmed civilians in Beijing on June 4
in crushing the pro-democracy movement.
   The Supreme Court advised that people who surrender or report the
crimes of others be given lenient treatment.
   Li, in remarks Monday, said ``counterrevolutionary unrest'' had
been put down, but ``quite a lot of rioters are yet to be
apprehended,'' the official Xinhua News Agency reported. ``We can in
no way leave them unpunished and let them stage a comeback.''
   Beijing radio reported today that Liu Gang one of 21 student
activists on a nationwide wanted list, was arrested Monday in
Baoding, about 90 miles south of Beijing. Gang, 28, a physics
student at Beijing University and one of the leaders of a now-banned
independent student union, is the sixth to be arrested or surrender
since the list was announced June 13.
   The Communist Party's People's Daily reported today that a
student from the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts in Hangzhou had been
arrested for spreading rumors to the U.S. government-funded Voice of
America.
   The newspaper said Zhang Weiping told VOA that the provincial
government flew the Chinese flag at half-staff to mourn students
killed in Beijing when troops drove them from Tiananmen Square, the
country's symbolic seat of power.
   The VOA office in Beijing confirmed that Zhang had called from
the city near Shanghai, but said it did not know whether its
Chinese-language service out of Washington ran the item.
   VOA, which enjoys a huge audience in China, has been accused by
the government of ``rumor-mongering'' in its reports on the military
crackdown. The VOA Beijing bureau chief was expelled from China last
week.
   The government on Monday said it was expelling another foreign
journalist for violating martial law regulations.
   Joseph Kahn, an American working part-time for the Dallas Morning
News, was stopped by police last week after interviewing people in
the countryside outside Beijing, an area not under martial law. He
was given 72 hours to leave.
   In addition to Kahn and the VOA bureau chief, an Associated Press
correspondent and three British reporters have been ordered out in
the past 10 days.
   The Canadian Embassy today requested a meeting with the Foreign
Ministry to protest an apparent attempt by plainclothes police to
seize Jan Wong, correspondent for the Toronto Globe and Mail. There
was no immediate response from the Chinese.
   Miss Wong, a Chinese-Canadian, said she was walking home from the
her embassy after interviewing Chinese waiting in line for visas
when two men grabbed her and tried to force her into a car.
   She said she screamed and struggled and escaped when a crowd of
pedestrians and bicyclists stopped to watch.
   A crew for the CBS television network was detained for 2{ hours
this morning on troop-occupied Tiananmen Square. CBS said the crew
was lectured before being released.
   The new foreign travel rules that took effect today invalidate
all previously issued exit permits and require passport holders to
obtain new ones before they can apply at foreign embassies for
visas. Starting today, Chinese guards outside embassies began
barring people without the new permits.
   The U.S. Embassy said only three Chinese showed up with the new
permit and were able to apply for visas, down from 350 applications
on Monday.
   Chinese news media, which last week showed hours of graphic tape
of crowds attacking soldiers and burning military vehicles during
the June 4 assault, emphasized today that the rebellion had been
quashed and life was returning to normal.
   The national news showed farmers harvesting winter wheat and
factories in full production. Foreign tourists and businessmen
appeared on every news show as the government tried to emphasize
that the political situation had stabilized and it was now safe for
foreigners to return.
   Thousands of foreign business executives left the country after
the military takeover of Beijing, and tourism, source of more than
$2 billion in annual revenue, has dried up.

   New York's education commissioner today
canceled statewide chemistry exams for 80,000 high school students
after the New York Post, citing widespread thefts of the test,
published a stolen answer sheet.
   Commissioner Thomas Sobol described the Post's move as ``beneath
contempt.''
   Attorney General Robert Abrams' office said it was investigating
the theft of two exams in New York City and looking into reports
that copies of them were being sold for as much as $2,000 to groups
of students who split the cost.
   The New York Board of Regents sponsors 17 exams on different
subjects, which it distributed to high schools in padlocked safes
for administering June 15-22.
   The exams are crucial for many students to graduate from high
school without attending summer school and to get a diploma
acceptable to colleges.
   The Post reported that so many stolen tests were circulating it
took the newspaper just 15 minutes and two phone calls to obtain a
copy of the chemistry answer sheet.
   The tabloid printed the 56 answers on its front page, explaining,
``The Post is publishing it only after learning that thousands of
answer sheets have been photocopied by and distributed to high
school students illegally.''
   Post Editor Jerry Nachman did not immediately return a telephone
call today.
   Sobol's spokeswoman, Linda Fisher, said a new chemistry exam will
be offered Aug. 17 and the state also will grant students credit
based on their high school chemistry grades. Other exams went on as
scheduled this morning.
   Fisher estimated the cost of preparing and administering the new
test at $250,000.
   She said Sobol canceled the exam after learning that the answers
in the Post were quickly being ``faxed'' across the state.

<HEAD>Strategists See Child Care as Significant Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Child care will be a significant issue in the
1990 congressional campaign and Republican chances could be damaged
if child care and parental-leave legislation is vetoed by President
Bush, GOP and Democratic political strategists said Tuesday.
   Vince Breglio, a Republican consultant who was pollster for the
Bush campaign in 1988 and is a former director of the Republican
Senate campaign committee, said: ``I don't believe serious political
candidates in 1990 can avoid discussing the issue of child care. I
don't believe they can avoid discussing the issue of long-term
health care.''
   Breglio said he did not believe parental leave would be an issue
because ``in terms of an issue you have to have clear-cut
differences. It is very hard for me to imagine two candidates going
at each other over the issue of parental leave.''
   Celinda Lake, a Democratic consultant, argued that ``work and
family issues,'' including child care, parental leave and long-term
health care, ``have emerged as major policy issues in 1990.''
   ``The president has vetoed the minimum wage,'' Ms. Lake said.
``There is some possibility of a veto of parental leave and child
care. If those three vetos come down, that is a definite statement
of the Republicans' position on work and family issues, and it is up
to the Democrats to take those voting records into the district and
make those the issues that decide elections.''
   The two consultants appeared on a panel sponsored by the Child
Care Action Campaign, the Great American Family Tour, and Lifetime
television, which discussed results of a poll published by several
magazines in February in which 74 percent of those responding said
family issues should be a top priority for the president and
Congress.
   Breglio, asked by a member of the audience about the effects of a
series of presidential vetos, said, ``I think any time you are seen
as a naysayer, that you have nothing positive to offer in the
debate, you have a problem with voters of either gender.''
   ``If programs have particular importance to women and you are
vetoing a series of programs ... I think the cumulative effect of
that could have more impact than, say, a single program and
certainly that is one thing we would be watching,'' he said.
   Breglio said the most recent White House poll indicates about 5
to 6 percent more support for Bush's child care program, based on a
tax credit, than for a program being considered in Congress that
would involve direct government funding.
   ``So far, George Bush is doing pretty well with women,'' he said.
``The numbers look very good. Now, if there is a whole series of
vetos on legislation that is of particular importance to women, that
could be a different ball game.''

   The United States has urged China to grant
clemency to demonstrators sentenced to death in Beijing and Shanghai
and to pardon those who were arrested in pro-democracy protests, the
White House said today.
   ``Sentences of death in Shanghai and Beijing could only deepen
the wounds of the past few weeks,'' said White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   He declined to say what, if any, steps the United States might
take if China goes ahead with executions.
   The White House announcement came on the heels of demands in
Congress and elsewhere that the United States intensify its
condemnation of Chinese repression and consider further sanctions
against the Beijing government.
   Fitzwater said China's ambassador to the United States, Han Xu,
was called to the State Department Monday night to hear what the
spokesman called ``the strong United States' position.''
   Hinting at worsening relations between Beijing and Washington,
Fitzwater said ``the United States raised this subject in the spirit
of a country that has worked with China over the past two decades to
improve relations.
   ``We believe that human rights are universal, and our duty to
comment on them is great,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We urge the leaders of the Peoples Republic of China to show
clemency and to use their powers to pardon those who were arrested
in the demonstrations for democracy,'' Fitzwater said.
   Human rights are ``an important principle by which the United
States judges its relations'' with all countries in the world, he
said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in prepared testimony
for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States
strongly supports reform in the communist world and accused Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev of dodging the China issue.
   ``To stand in the way of such necessary historic changes _ as we
are seeing to our outrage and sorrow in China _ is to turn one's
back on the future,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's ``temporizing comments on those tragic events are
disappointing,'' Baker said.
   On a visit last week to West Germany, Gorbachev said he did not
have ``sufficient information'' on what was happening in China to
make a ``balanced and responsible'' judgment.

   Although the administration is trying to keep Americans from
returning to China, only military transactions with Beijing have
been suspended by Bush.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and other lawmakers have
called on Bush to consider other punitive measures and also step up
U.S. condemnation of the Chinese government.
   At a news conference almost two weeks ago, Bush rejected the
suggestion of more sanctions against China, saying the halt of
weapons sales went far enough under present circumstances. ``I think
that the position we took, aiming not at the Chinese people but at
the military arrangements, was well-received around the world, and
was followed by many countries right after we did that,'' he said.
   Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, took
refuge June 4 at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing shortly after the
military crushed pro-democracy protests.
   Fang has led Chinese intellectuals in calling for release of
political prisoners and asserting that economic and scientific
progress is impossible without protections for free thought. He was
also angered the Chinese by saying Marxism is dead.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said Monday
American workers are being advised strongly not to return to jobs in
China. ``We're not going to lift our travel advisory. That remains
in effect,'' she said.
   The advisory _ which is a suggestion and not an order _ was
posted after Chinese Army troops attacked students demonstrating for
a more liberal regime June 3-4 in Tiananmen Square.
   Thousands of Americans subsequently left China, some with U.S.
assistance, thereby stripping U.S. companies of many of their key
personnel.
   About 175 American companies have offices in China. Many of them
have received word from their Chinese partners in joint ventures
reporting that the turmoil has subsided.
   Ms. Tutwiler said that despite ``a pause in anti-U.S. propaganda
over the weekend,'' the situation in China remains ``far from
normal.''
   She said criticism of the Voice of America resumed on Saturday,
and that articles had appeared attacking expelled VOA Bureau Chief
Alan Pessin and Associated Press correspondent John Pomfret.
   On Sunday, the official New China News Agency said Fitzwater's
criticism of death sentences imposed on three Chinese for burning a
train was ``ridiculous.''

<HEAD>Leaning Tower of Providence Immortalized on T-Shirts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The building that twice has defied
explosions to fell it, now is being immortalized in three T-shirt
designs and their creators are in a spat over whose brainstorm the
shirt idea was.
   One depicts ``The Leaning Tower of Providence,'' another ``The
Leaning Tower of Bilray,'' for the construction company that pulled
the boo-boo, and ``The Hartford Park Horror Project,'' sponsored by
Republicans who want to make political capital from the snafu.
   Bilray, contracted by the Providence Housing Authority, tried
twice on May 21 to implode the Hartford Park housing project and
succeeded only in knocking out one floor, leaving the L-shaped
building leaning on itself.
   The company has since been working at taking the building down
with a traditional wrecking ball.
   State GOP Chairman Michael Vallante came out with the Republican
T-shirt on Monday, but he says he had the idea all along but just
got sidetracked about getting the shirts made up.
   The housing authority sold out its first 100 shirts Thursday and
says it has 300 more going on sale Tuesday, with a price increase
from $4 to $6.
   When Bilray groused they already had $9 shirts for sale, Stephen
O'Rourke, the authority's director, said he was the one who came up
with the phrase ``Leaning Tower of Bilray'' the day the implosion
failed.
   ``What does he want to do, sue us?'' O'Rourke said. ``I mean this
is not one of those things that is high up on my agenda.''
   Vallante said the GOP would offer to eventually add the total
cost of the project to the back of its $5 shirts.
   ``The people of Providence have a right to know what is the cost
in extra security, the costs for safety, the cost of the lost
business in the area for this tower that is a testament to
incompetence,'' Vallante said.

   The last thing Rudolf Ludwig expected to
be served for breakfast on his arctic cruise was vodka.
   Ludwig had gone to bed early Monday night, leaving his wife to
enjoy a cabaret evening aboard the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky.
He ended up spending five hours in a lifeboat floating among
icebergs.
   ``I was in bed when suddenly there was a terrible crash that
almost shook me out of bed,'' said Ludwig, one of more than 950
passengers and crew aboard the vessel when it struck an iceberg.
   Obeying instructions from the ship's loudspeakers, the
67-year-old West German pensioner with a walking disability pulled
on his trousers, put on his life vest and went on deck to stand by a
lifeboat.
   The liner, on a cruise out of Bremerhaven, West Germany, struck
the iceberg about 300 miles east of northern Greenland. No injuries
were reported.
   ``We are all safe and sound here,'' Ludwig said in a telephone
interview from a church on the Norwegian island of Svalbard, where
passengers were taken by ship and helicopter after the accident.
   Ludwig said he had just heard that his wife was safe and coming
to join him. They were being taken home to Wiesbaden as soon as the
rescue operation was complete, he said.
   He seemed in good spirits, joking: ``I'm standing here in my
pajamas, and the trousers keep wanting to fall down to my knees.''
   For a while, though, there was nothing to laugh about.
   ``When I got up on deck, I saw enormous ice blocks around. We
were told to get into the lifeboats,'' he said, adding that there
was no panic.
   ``We sat for five hours among the icebergs. The atmosphere was
calm, and the Russian sailors did everything they could. They gave
us vodka and whiskey in the boats, since it was cold,'' said Ludwig.
``And blankets too.''
   Temperatures in the area were about 38 degrees.
   ``From the lifeboats, we could see that a third of the ship was
under water,'' he said. Ludwig said that the ship appeared to be
moving fast through the icy waters before the crash. There was a
slight fog, but not enough to impair vision, he said.
   The Norwegian coast guard vessel Senja reached the stricken ship
early Tuesday and picked up hundreds of passengers who had jumped
into lifeboats or scrambled onto ice floes, said Kjell Larssen of
the north Norway Rescue Center at Bodoe. Others were rescued by
helicopter from the ship or ice floes.
   ``My wife will get here in a while,'' he said. ``They've gotten
blankets and stuff together so that people can spend the night, I
suppose.''

   A woman underwent back surgery on live TV and
said she agreed to it in hopes of helping others who may need the
operation.
   ``I don't feel invaded at all,'' said Deborah Arizin, 27, a sales
representative from Haddonfield, N.J., who had suffered from back
pain for more than half her life. The surgery took place on public
television Monday night.
   The 2{-hour operation to help correct a 50-degree curvature of
Mrs. Arizin's spine is expected to make the 5-foot-9-inch patient an
inch and a half taller.
   ``It's really kind of surprising, but the focus is the surgery
and the new technique and how it can help other patients,'' Mrs.
Arizin said. ``I agreed in the hope that it would help other people
who are going through the same thing.''
   WHYY said it broadcast the operation live for its impact and
educational value.
   ``It's more exciting. It's more television, more immediate. It's
just much more real. We did it as an attempt to show people what
it's really like, without editing,'' said station manager David
Othmer.
   WHYY spokeswoman Tina Brock today said the station received at
least 330 calls, its highest ever for one show. She said viewers
called the program ``absolutely breathtaking'' and ``magnificent,''
but several found it gory.
   Ms. Brock said the show received a good 6.9 rating and an 11
percent share against the network lineup, which began at 8 p.m. with
``Kate &amp; Allie'' on CBS, ``ALF'' on NBC and ``MacGyver'' in ABC. The
rating is percentage of all homes with television, the share a
percentage of televisions in use.
   Dr. Richard Rothman, founder of Pennsylvania Hospital's Rothman
Institute for orthopedic surgery, was host during the operation at
the hospital.
   ``It was a tense evening because of the live television, but
everything went extremely well,'' Rothman said. ``This is real life,
that's what makes this operation so interesting. We do it every day,
and even we are impressed.''
   Viewers saw Mrs. Arizin, who was introduced in taped sequences,
lying on her stomach on the operating table, surgical drapes
covering her from the shoulders up and the hips down.
   Three cameras, including an overhead one, covered the 10-member
medical team at work in the two-hour, 20-minute program.
   Dr. Richard Balderston performed the operation, during which
stainless steel rods were attached to the vertebrae to nearly
straighten Mrs. Arizin's spine. Bone was then grafted onto the rods
to hold them in place.
   ``The surgery used to take six to seven hours. It now takes two
to four hours,'' Balderston said. ``Patients used to be in bed for
as long as six months. Now they're out of bed in one or two days.
They used to be in a plaster body cast for as long as a year. Now
it's very unusual to need a cast.''
   Two percent of Americans suffer from curvature of the spine, or
scoliosis.

<TEXT>
   A political crisis and new elections loomed
Tuesday as conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis was given
three days to form a government but was rejected by a possible
left-wing coalition partner.
   Both Mitsotakis's New Democracy Party and the communist-dominated
leftist alliance, who together won nearly 60 percent of Sunday's
vote, say a new government first must punish those responsible for
the scandals of the defeated socialist administration of Premier
Andreas Papandreou.
   But the alliance of the pro-Soviet Greek Communist Party and the
Greek Left Party, which finished third, turned down Mitsotakis'
offer to join in an interim government that would investigate the
corruption.
   The alliance also refuses to cooperate with Papandreou, making
the possibility of new elections likely and paralyzing Parliament,
which cannot order an inquiry if the political parties cannot form a
government.
   Mitsotakis said Papandreou cannot keep making national decisions
and demanded the replacement within 24 hours of officials appointed
by Papandreou, including the governors of Greece's 56 provinces, the
heads of state organizations, including radio and television, and
the secret service.
   ``I can assure you there will be catharsis,'' Mitsotakis told a
news conference after President Christos Sartzetakis gave him the
mandate to form a government.
   ``A solution has to be found as soon as possible, to allow
parliament to investigate the scandals and to initiate
prosecutions,'' he added.
   Mitsotakis, who finished first with 44.29 percent of the vote and
144 of parliament's 300 seats, did not indicate how he might
overcome the leftists' refusal to join him in a coalition.
   If Mitsotakis fails to form a government within three days, the
president will ask Papandreou and the leftist alliance in turn to
try.
   Mitsotakis clarified his coalition offer would only last a few
months and would focus on investigating and prosecuting corruption.
   Following that, ``then we will go to new elections which will
provide the political solution, which these elections did not,''
Mitsotakis added.
   Under the constitution, Papandreou continues as caretaker premier
until there is a new government, or new elections are held.
   Mitsotakis said he told the president that Papandreou could not
continue handling matters of national interest since the socialists
were defeated.
   With 98 percent of the votes counted, the leftist-communist
coalition has emerged as a kingmaker with 13.5 percent of the vote
giving it 31 seats in the parliament.
   New Democracy won 44.29 percent, giving it 144 seats, seven short
of a majority, and Papandreou's Panehellenic Socialist Movement
39.18 percent, giving it 125 seats.
   The communists said they are ready to cooperate with Papandreou's
party, but only if Papandreou and all other party members they
maintain are involved in the scandals are excluded.
   Papandreou and senior members of his party have been accused by
the opposition of being involved in a multimillion-dollar scandal by
fugitive banker George Koskotas, the owner of the Bank of Crete.
Koskotas is in prison in the United States awaiting the hearing of
an extradition demand by the Greek government.
   Mitsotakis and the communist alliance maintain the election
result was a clear mandate for an investigation of the scandals.
   But Papandreou said Tuesday that ``the Greek people gave the
majority to the democratic-progressive forces and excluded the
return of the right and conservatism to power.''
   ``These forces have the obligation to govern the state. This is
the clear and indisputable mandate of the Greek people,'' he added,
in what was interpreted as yet another indirect appeal to the
communist alliance to join forces with his party.

<HEAD>Criticizes Gorbachev, Supports Reform in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Tuesday endorsed the ``potential revolution'' under way in the
Soviet Union but criticized President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for not
taking a strong stand against suppression of reform in China.
   Baker, in a prepared statement to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, reigstered U.S. support for reform throughout the
communist world. Whether in Asia or in Europe, he said, reform ``is
very much in our interests.''
   At the same time, Baker said no one could predict the outcome of
the changes taking place in Moscow and elsewhere. ``In the end,'' he
said, ``we do know that the success of reform will depend primarily
upon choices made in Moscow, Beijing or East Berlin, not Washington,
Brussels or Bonn.''
   He stressed, however, that political and economic reform were
necessary in order for the East to progress.
   ``To stand in the way of such necessary, historic change _ as we
are seeing to our outrage and sorrow in China _ is to turn one's
back to the future. And that is why General Secretary Gorbachev's
temporizing comments on those tragic events are disappointing,'' he
said.
   Baker apparently referred to a statement by the Soviet leader
last week that he did not have ``sufficient information'' on events
in China to make a ``balanced and responsible judgment'' about
Beijing's actions.
   Baker appeared before the committee mostly to report on his
meeting in Moscow last month with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and on the summit President Bush held in Brussels at
the end of the month with the leaders of the 15 other North Atlantic
Treaty Organization nations.
   There Bush outlined a proposal for reductions in NATO and Warsaw
Pact conventional troops and armories in Europe and delayed
consideration of deploying more powerful short-range nuclear
missiles in West Germany.
   Baker told the committee the administration was ``exploring and
establishing new vehicles'' to foster cooperation with the Soviet
Union.
   ``We're actively engaging Moscow with our eyes open and fixed on
our longstanding goals and interests,'' he said.
   Baker said these goals were to protect Western security and to
promote democratic values and interests.
   ``The movement we're seeing in Soviet politics presents a
potential revolution _ a revolution we hope will succeed,'' Baker
said.
   In reviewing U.S. relations with the Soviet Union for the Senate
committee, he endorsed reform in Moscow, Eastern Europe and China.

   The ``Bad Boys'' of basketball wore genial
smiles Tuesday as President Bush praised the talent and
determination of the Detroit Pistons, this year's NBA champions.
   Praising their aggressive style of play and the charitable work
of team members, Bush said, ``You may be to some the bad side of
basketball, but off the court people see the kinder, gentler side of
the Detroit Pistons.''
   The Pistons won the NBA title with a four-game sweep that
dethroned the Los Angeles Lakers.
   ``It takes a team to win _ talent, drive and dedication that goes
12 men deep,'' Bush said at a ceremony in the Old Executive Office
Building next to the White House. ``And that's the secret of success
of any kind. And it's the winning formula ... that made the Detroit
Pistons the world champs.''
   Guard Isiah Thomas and team owner Bill Davidson gave a basketball
to the president, who called two children belonging to the District
of Columbia Boys' and Girls' Clubs onto the stage for a short game
of catch.

<TEXT>
   The Conciergerie, the dank and forbidding stone
prison where victims of the French Revolution spent their final
moments, opened to the public Tuesday in all its former gloom and
grandeur.
   Queen Marie Antoinette occupied a cell on the ground floor for 10
weeks in 1793, hoping her supporters would come up with enough money
to buy her freedom.
   She waited in vain, and went to her death at the guillotine on
Oct. 16, 1793.
   The cell she shared with her jailer later was turned into a
chapel as a shrine to her memory, but a replica of the cell has been
recreated nearby and is decorated with wallpaper embossed with the
royal blue and gold lily emblems that covered the walls 200 years
ago.
   Maximilien Robespierre, who sent thousands of heads rolling
during his 12-month Reign of Terror against counterrevolutionaries,
spent his final hours a few cells away on July 28, 1794.
   ``His death warrant arrived about 10 a.m., and he was carted away
to the guillotine in mid-afternoon,'' Michel Colardelle of the
Culture Ministry said during a tour of the restored landmark
overlooking the Seine. The spot is marked by a simple black marble
plaque.
   Admirers of Robespierre, known as the Incorruptible, say history
has not done him justice.
   ``He has been made to bear all the guilt of the Terror,'' said
former Health Minister Leon Schwartzenberg, one of several public
figures eager to rehabilitate Robespierre's memory.
   ``All revolutions are characterized by excess of some sort,
otherwise they would not be revolutions,'' he said.
   No one, however, can accuse the French of not paying tribute to
Robespierre's victims and others who died during the turbulent
events.
   A small room on the second floor is devoted entirely to their
memory. Its four walls are covered with framed lists, in
alphabetical order, of the 2,780 aristocrats, gardeners, shoemakers,
doctors and clergymen found guilty by the Revolutionary Tribunal and
beheaded within three days. The verdict was either guilty or
acquittal. There were no appeals.
   Some names are familiar, like Charlotte Corday, who stabbed
Jean-Paul Marat in his bath. Others, like F. Perrin, gardener, are
not.
   A short film with English subtitles helps visitors follow the
events and depicts daily life at the prison.
   Ordinary prisoners shared the squalor of cold cells littered with
filthy straw. The wealthy bought their way into cells furnished with
beds and sometimes even desks, where many an aristocrat penned his
memoirs.
   Also recreated are the quarters where the condemned were taken to
have their shirts ripped wide and the napes of their necks shaved so
the guillotine's blade would cut cleanly.
   Prisoners were allowed to circulate freely during the day in the
women's courtyard. Despite their predicament, many privileged ladies
managed to keep up with fashion trends, and even groomed themselves
without the help of maids.
   ``Marie Antoinette, in her final days, even learned to put up her
own hair,'' said Jean Chalon, author of a recent biography.
   The $375,000 renovation of the Conciergerie is one of several
refurbishing projects linked to bicentennial celebrations.

<TEXT>
   David Rivkin has produced hit albums for Prince,
Fine Young Cannibals and Jody Watley, but the Minneapolis native has
``higher'' priorities.
   ``In the back of my mind, I always go for the single,'' said the
producer of Prince's ``Kiss,'' Watley's ``Looking for a New Love''
and Fine Young Cannibals' ``She Drives Me Crazy,'' all No. 1 smashes.
   ``I go for the throat, really. I really am a singles-oriented
person. It's really the way I want to go after it.''
   Like a baseball manager who must cope with the personalities of
different players, Rivkin _ known in the business as David Z _
adjusts his style to fit the artist. With Prince, a gifted
songwriter and arranger, the producer sees himself as a collaborator
and occasional mind reader.
   ``He's a different personality every day, so you just have to
capture whatever personality he is that day. I just think about how
to frame whatever mindset he's in.''
   With Tyka Nelson, Prince's introverted sister, Rivkin took a more
delicate approach.
   He remembered the Jets' first album as his most difficult.
   ``It was the first real time we discovered a new artrist and we
had to come through with all the songs and vocals. We were shooting
in the dark, we were taking kids from a bar band and trying to make
a national product,'' Rivkin said.
   ``We had to establish a direction. That was a bit difficult. We
had to do every vocal; there was no sampling. Somes things you take
for granted now.''
   Rivkin was once a musician himself, playing guitar for Billy
Preston and writing with country-rock artist Gram Parsons. He had
lived in Los Angeles in the early 1970s, but returned to his
hometown in 1974.
   He was soon behind the control board.
   ``I didn't want to do it at the time, but I realized I had much
more control over material sitting behind that seat. I gave up the
idea of being a rock star.''
   In 1980, he engineered Lipps, Inc.'s No. 1 dance hit,
``Funkytown,'' and played guitar on their album. He has since
produced a remarkable range of acts, from the Minnesota funk of
Prince and Jesse Johnson, to the blue-eyed soul of Hall &amp; Oates and
Boy George, to the dance music of Watley and Jermaine Jackson.
   ``I try to fill the holes the artists can't fill,'' he said.
``That comes from doing the right sound, a special snare drum sound,
a special vocal echo, and from making the artists feel good enough
to bring out their personality.''
   His sheer diversity has had drawbacks. In an industry that loves
labels and openly categorizes music according to race, it's hard to
define a white kid from the Midwest who produces best-selling dance
records by black artists.
   ``I used to be classified as an R&amp;B producer. It was a hard notch
to get out of. Because I was white, I would get a lot of flack. I've
had a lot of No. 1 black records. In the face of all that, my own
inclination was to combine rock and R&amp;B.''
   Rivkin compared himself to in a way to Alfred Hitchcock, speaking
of the cameo appearances that were the great film director's
trademark. A guitar riff is Rivkin's subtle way of popping up in his
work.
   ``I think if you look real hard, there's a thread running through
all those records,'' he said. ``Rhythmically, there's a certain
sound. ``In `Kiss,' it's a major part of the record. Sometimes, it
appears as a little wink.''
   His presence is unmistakeable in the studio. Hit singles don't
come easy and Rivkin pushes hard for the best sound.
   ``I make singers breath and emote a lot more than they would
normally. I always look for that sexy breath. There's a fine line
between getting it perfect and not losing the artist when you're
doing it. I don't care if there's some rough edges,'' he said.
   ``Finding a producer is like finding a wife. It's tough. It's a
chemistry thing. I like to get involved from the ground up. Usually,
what I do is start programming drum parts at home on my machine. If
you get a good drum and bass part, that's 90 percent of the pop
record.''

   Republican National Chairman Lee
Atwater's highly partisan remarks to the nation's mayors have
touched off criticism and dismay from elected city leaders of both
parties.
   ``I was embarrassed and disappointed,'' said Republican Mayor
Bill Hudnut of Indianapolis, following Atwater's remarks to the U.S.
Conference of Mayors on Monday.
   ``It was insulting to me and I think it was the most insensitive
speech I've ever heard,'' said Democratic Mayor Wilson Goode of
Philadelphia.
   Atwater used his appearance to declare the national Republican
Party would work actively for Republican mayoral candidates in New
York and elsewhere, and would seek to recruit ``a half dozen to a
dozen black mayoral candidates around this country to support
actively.''
   He drew a ripple of reaction from the more than 200 mayors when
he said mayors would be an ``effective farm team'' for the
Republicans who could later run for governor, House and Senate seats.
   And attempting to show his commitment to recruiting blacks,
Atwater singled out for introduction a black Republican mayor, James
A. Garner of Hempstead, N.Y., but mistakenly called him the mayor of
Schenectady, N.Y.
   Garner later called the slip insignificant and said, ``Chairman
Atwater knows my name and who I am.''
   Today, New York Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, told reporters that
GOP mayors had told him they were embarrassed by Atwater's remarks
targeting Koch for defeat.
   Koch called Atwater ``amoral'' and ``pathological'' for an
innuendo-filled memo blasting House Speaker Tom Foley. Atwater
denied having seen the memo before it was released, although an aide
resigned over the controversy.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, appearing before the
mayors today, attacked the GOP chairman for pushing politics ``to
its worst extremes.''
   ``Thanks to the Lee Atwaters of the world, national politics is
looking more and more like the coastline of Valdez, Alaska,'' he
said.
   ``It was too patronizing,'' Hudnut said Monday about Atwater's
remarks.
   ``I didn't think it was appropriate to refer to us as a farm team
for the major leagues,'' he added. ``I think a lot of mayors deal
with tougher issues than Congress does.''
   Atwater has been under fire for an innuendo-filled memo attacking
House Speaker Tom Foley, nd Brown has called on Atwater to resign.
   The president of the conference, Democratic Mayor Arthur Holland
of Trenton, N.J., referred to Atwater with a quip at a later session.
   ``I think Lee Atwater assumed that we had arranged a recruitment
opportunity for him,'' he said.
   Even Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp made
reference to Atwater's appearance and triggered applause when he
told the mayors he was there representing President Bush, ``not the
Republican National Committee.''
   Goode said he disliked the partisanship and Atwater's singling
out of the New York race, where Republicans hope to unseat Democrat
Edward I. Koch.
   ``We need to hear what the Republican party intends to do about
the issues facing the cities,'' Goode said. ``We don't want to know
that he wants to defeat Koch.''
   Koch had not yet arrived for the conference when Atwater spoke.
   In his remarks, Atwater said he was ``very excited'' about
prospects in New York and planned to put ``a substantial effort''
into that race.
   ``If we can establish a political beachhead in a city like New
York, that's going to be a political shot heard across this
country,'' he said.
   New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, a Democrat, pointed to
Atwater's remarks that the Republican Party was interested in cities
but would only put money in ``projects that work.'' Barthelemy noted
that the convention center where the meeting was held was financed
in part with federal Urban Development Action Grants, a program the
Reagan administration succeeded in killing.
   ``The very programs that help cities, they eliminated,''
Barthelemy said.

<HEAD>North Korea Willing to Resume Peace Talks With South Korea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea said Tuesday it was ready
to resume talks with South Korea on easing tension, but it also
denounced Seoul for arresting a top dissident and called for his
release.
   The communist nation delivered a letter at the Panmunjom border
truce site proposing the talks resume June 28. South Korea made a
similar proposal May 26.
   South Korean officials, who released the letter, had no immediate
response. The two nations have held talks at various levels since
August 1988 on improving relations, but there has been no major
progress.
   The latest talks are meant to set terms for the nations'
legislatures to meet for formal negotiations on easing tension and
reunification.
   North Korea suspended the talks in February after Seoul refused
to cancel annual military exercises held in March with the United
States. North Korea has been seeking the withdrawal of U.S. forces
from South Korea.
   The letter, from North Korean delegation head Chon Gum Chol,
charged South Korea delayed talks further by arresting a South
Korean dissident clergyman, the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, when he returned
in April from a visit to Pyongyang. Moon was charged with acting as
a North Korean agent.
   ``We consider that your side should set free Rev. Moon Ik-hwan,
who was arrested unreasonably ... and show sincerity to take a step
to create an atmosphere of dialogue,'' the letter said.
   Neither nation allows its citizens to visit the other side
without permission. Seoul said Moon's visit was part of efforts to
cause political chaos.
   Separate government talks and negotiations between sports
officials on forming a joint team for the 1990 Asian Games in
Beijing have been suspended until July. The two sides have not said
if they will resume.

   Winemakers Ernest and Julio Gallo today won
exclusive rights to the family name, thwarting a younger brother who
had put his name on a brand of cheese.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle ruled that Joseph Gallo's use
of his full name on cheese was calculated to mislead consumers into
thinking the brand is connected with the E &amp; J Gallo Winery.
   The judge ordered Joseph Gallo to quit using his name on cheese.
   Joseph Gallo has no direct connection with the Modesto,
Calif.-based Gallo Winery, the world's largest, but sells grapes to
his older brothers
   Joseph Gallo's attorney, Denis Rice, said he will recommend an
appeal. Rice said at trial in December that he knew of no case in
which a person was prohibited from using his full name on a
non-competing product.
   Ernest and Julio Gallo claimed in a 1986 lawsuit that they had
contracted with a company to market cheese under the Gallo name.
   Patrick Lynch, attorney for the winery, contended that Joseph
Gallo was ``riding on the recognition and riding on the power that
the Gallo mark conferred.''
   Previously, a federal judge threw out a countersuit in which
Joseph Gallo, 69, claimed he is entitled to one-third of the winery
holdings on grounds that it developed from the estate of the Gallo
brothers' parents.
   Ernest, now 80, and Julio, now 78, began making wine in 1933,
shortly after their father killed their mother, then committed
suicide, their attorney said.

   Michael Jackson's illness last fall cost
concert-canceled fans up to $4.50 a ticket, and a judge has ruled
they can sue as a group to try to get their money back.
   The civil lawsuit, filed by Seattle attorney Thomas Wampold, asks
for damages of three times the service fees, which ranged from $2.50
to $4.50 a ticket. The suit was originally filed on behalf of nine
fans, but King County Superior Court Judge Jim Bates ruled Monday
that all 72,000 ticket holders could be represented. A win for the
fans could cost Ticketmaster up to $640,000.
   Ticketmaster refused to refund the full $23.50 price of tickets
for Oct. 31, Nov. 1 and Nov. 2 concerts canceled because Jackson was
ill.
   Fred Rosen, chairman of the board of Los Angeles-based
Ticketmaster, said ticket agents typically do not refund service
charges if an event is canceled and consider the fees a cost of
doing business. He compared the fees to shipping charges that
consumers must pay when they return merchandise to a department
store.
   He said it cost Ticketmaster about $50,000 to handle the refunds.

   She said she would like for the PTA to become less of a

   ``Seeing all these is a big thrill for me,'' said Richard
Blackwell as he viewed 45 of his creations Monday that Colorado
State University has on display. ``I mean, these are unbelievable.''
   Blackwell, a former fashion designer, compiles the ``worst

   Besides the Diller bra, the Blackwell collection included gowns,
dresses and boas. It is said to be the only collection of its kind

a Denver couple.
   The clothing is part of CSU's collection of 7,000 garments

<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday that it will
fund several projects to recycle some of the 16 billion disposable
diapers used and discarded in the United States each year.
   Plans call for the plastic in the diapers to be recycled into
such things as flower pots, garabage bags and park benches, while
the pulp will be used in cardboard boxes, building insulation and
wallboard liner.
   Environmentalists warn that the plastic-coated disposable
diapers, used by 85 percent of babies in the United States, don't
decompose. That, they say, could provide potential breeding grounds
for dangerous viruses and bacteria that cause polio, hepatitis,
meningitis and other diseases.
   ``We believe as a company it is our responsibility to ensure that
our products are good not only for the baby but that they are good
for the environment and can be easily recycled, composed and
incinerated,'' said Nancy Eddy, P&amp;G's project coordinator.
   P&amp;G, the largest disposable diaper maker, sells $1.65 billion
worth of Pampers and Luvs annually.
   Company officials, speaking at a news conference at the National
Press Club, said P&amp;G would spend an undetermined amount of money
over the next five years on recycling projects in the states of
Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Florida.
   The project includes an effort with the Solid Waste Utility and
Rabanco Co. of Seattle, Wash., which will collect used diapers from
1,000 volunteer households. The diapers will be washed and sanitized
before being separated into plastic and pulp.
   P&amp;G also will provide money and soiled diapers to Recomp Inc., a
St. Cloud, Minn., recycling company that turns much of that city's
garbage into a composted soil used in landscaping and to reclaim
salt-tainted highway strips.
   St. Cloud already recycles diapers, but P&amp;G will import
additional dirty diapers from St. Paul.
   Diapers, which make up an estimated 1 percent to 2 percent of the
nation's garbage heap, are not the largest landfill problem. But
items such as paper, bottles and cans, unlike diapers, can be
recycled.
   Nebraska lawmakers have banned the sale of non-biodegradable
diapers by 1993. The legislation notes both the environmental threat
and the fact that biodegradable diapers use a plastic made from
corn, a crop grown in Nebraska.
   Legislators in Iowa, Washington and Oregon have considered
similar action.
   Richard Nicolosi, vice president of P&amp;G's paper products
division, said the announcement was not motivated by market or
legislative pressures.
   ``I don't think that any one announcement is going to stop the
concern within state legislatures,'' he said. ``What I hope it will
do is focus attention on viable solutions.''
   Carl Lehrburger, an Albany, N.Y., recycling expert who has
studied disposable diapers for the cloth-diaper industry, asked if
the recycling of plastic and paper would be economically feasible.
   ``I applaud their efforts in seeking alternatives to the
environmentally harmful disposal of their product,'' he said, but
added that the company seemed determined to maintain its product
rather than changing to a more ecologically sound diaper.
   P&amp;G will spend $160,000 in an effort to prove that competitors'
diapers, touted as biodegradable, don't decompose any faster than
P&amp;G brands.
   Robert Ham, an environmental engineer at the University of
Wisconsin, will bury regular and biodegradable disposable diapers in
landfill sites in Madison, Wis., West Palm Beach, Fla., and a site
in Maine still to be chosen.
   The ``time capsules'' will be exhumed over the next five years to
see if biodegradable diapers decompose any faster than the regular
disposable diapers made by P&amp;G.
   ``We don't believe that biodegradability is a solid-waste
solution,'' said Bob Greene, associate director of P&amp;G research and
development.

<HEAD>Glenn Urges Cheney to Suspend B-2, Reinstate Osprey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Democratic member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee on Tuesday urged Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to
suspend production of the B-2 stealth bomber because the aircraft
has yet to undergo flight testing.
   Cheney in response reaffirmed his support for the B-2, which at
$500 million a copy is the most expensive plane in history. The
bomber is a necessary component of the triad of air-, land- and
sea-based nuclear weapons, said Pete Williams, Cheney's spokesman.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a former astronaut and test pilot,
argued that pursuing production of the radar-evading plane violates
the rule of ``fly before buy.''
   The bomber program has been ``buy it, and then we'll see how it
flies,'' Glenn said in a letter to Cheney.
   ``The B-2 is a total departure from our usual new aircraft,''
Glenn said. said. ``It is a flying wing. There are new control
concepts, different center of gravity considerations, and new
aerodynamics just to name a few. Going ahead with additional
production before flight tests have even started just doesn't make
sense.''
   Cheney has proposed pushing back production of the stealth bomber
a year to 1993 and cutting almost $4.1 billion from fiscal 1990 and
1991 budgets for the plane.
   Glenn said $22.4 billion has already been invested in the stealth
program, and concluded that it would be ``totally irresponsible'' to
continue production without flight test results.
   Glenn argued that the money earmarked for the stealth bomber
could be used for ``high-priority conventional programs that have
been terminated or deferred.''
   Glenn, a former Marine, said he favors the Marine Corps' V-22
Osprey, a battlefield aircraft designed to take off like a
helicopter and fly like an airplane. The Pentagon had hoped to spend
$25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys, including $1.3 billion in 1990, but
Cheney decided to terminate the program.
   Cheney is ``a big believer in the triad, and he thinks the B-2's
long-range capabilities and its stealth capacities make it an
important strategic asset to the United States,'' said Williams.
``So, he plans to continue right on with that and he reaffirmed his
strong support for the B-2 program.''

   A hot-under-the-collar William Hurt today gave a
lawyer the big chill and refused to answer his questions after the
attorney made a wisecrack about the conception of the actor's
6-year-old son.
   ``I'm blocked. I can't hear you,'' the star of ``Body Heat'' and
``The Big Chill'' said as A. Richard Golub pressed him about his
feelings for former lover Sandra Jennings after the birth of their
son, Alexander.
   Jennings, a 32-year-old former ballerina, is pursuing a
multimillion-dollar divorce claim against Hurt, contending they had
``a spiritual marriage'' more sacrosanct than a legal union.
   Golub today became frustrated during cross-examination of Hurt by
constant objections from the defense. He complained to the judge
that the objections were ``interrupting my rhythm, and rhythm is
everything.''
   As Golub sought to resume questioning, Hurt _ who had been
snappish, combative and evasive in a day and a half of testimony _
said to Golub, ``Get your rhythm right.''
   Golub replied: ``You got your rhythm right when you made Alex,
didn't you?''
   Hurt turned to Justice Jacqueline Silbermann and said, ``You can
permit that?'' She told Golub to confine himself to the issues.
   When Golub resumed questioning, Hurt said he was couldn't hear
the questions. He leveled his finger at Golub and accused him of
making ``a perverse and insulting remark about my son.'' The judge
declared a recess.
   Jennings is seeking half the money Hurt has made since Dec. 9,
1982, when he learned his divorce from his first wife, actress Mary
Beth Hurt, was final. Golub put Hurt's worth at about $10 million.
   Jennings claims a common-law marriage exists because she and Hurt
lived together from 1981 to 1984. ``He told me we were married in
the eyes of God,'' she said during a courtroom break Monday.
   Hurt, 39, said he told Jennings after they started living
together that he was put off marriage by ``the pain of it not
working out with Mary Beth.''
   In March, Hurt married Heidi Henderson, daughter of bandleader
Skitch Henderson.
   Hurt, who won a best-actor Oscar for ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman,'' also has starred in ``Broadcast News,'' ``Gorky Park,''
``The Accidental Tourist'' and ``Children of a Lesser God.''

   Dieters who lose 10 or 20 pounds may give away
their baggy old clothes. But Dennis Genz's 173-pound loss left him
with too much skin, so he donated about 4 square feet to help save
burn victims.
   ``This is a first for us. ... Occasionally, rarely, if a child is
a patient a parent may donate skin,'' Betty Perls, director of
education for the Regional Organ Bank of Illinois, said Tuesday.
   The 5-foot-11 Genz, 43, weighed 430 pounds last August when he
began a high-protein weight-loss regimen.
   Last week, he weighed in at 260 and prepared for surgery to
remove excess skin from his abdomen to ease back pains and other
problems.
   ``I was sitting at lunch with some nurses and we were joking that
it was too bad I couldn't donate the skin,'' said Genz, equipment
coordinator for the emergency department at Sherman Hospital in
Elgin, just northwest of Chicago.
   ``Then one of the nurses said, `Why not?''' he recalled Tuesday
from his hospital bed, where he was recovering from Monday's surgery.
   The decision ``left me with a good feeling,'' Genz said, adding
that he felt fine but had ``kind of a big scar.''
   ``I've worked in emergency rooms for 25 years. ... I'm a strong
supporter of transplants,'' he said.
   What if he gains back the lost weight?
   ``The skin would just stretch out again _ but I don't intend to
gain the weight back,'' Genz said.
   The operation removed 19{ pounds of skin and adjoining tissue,
Genz said.
   His donated skin _ about four square feet _ will be used to care
for burn patients at the University of Chicago Medical Center.
   ``More lives are saved by skin transplants than any other donated
organ,'' said Dr. Lawrence Gottlieb, professor of surgery and
director of the university's burn unit.
   ``What kills burn patients is loss of fluid and infection,'' Ms.
Perls said.
   Donated skin ``is used as a kind of living bandage'' while the
patient regenerates his own skin, she said. Then the borrowed tissue
sloughs off.
   Because its use is temporary, skin used for burn patients need
not be a perfect tissue type match like that used for skin grafts or
other organ transplants, Ms. Perls said.
   She noted that noting most such tissue is removed from cadavers.
   But while Getz's contribution is unusual, ``this kind of weight
loss is unusual, too,'' she said.
   ``Anything that will make people think about organ or tissue
donation is good,'' she said.
   University hospital spokesman John Easton agreed.
   ``There's a shortage of any sort of donated organ. ... It is
beneficial and it comes at a good time _ I think they're planning to
use some of it today,'' Easton said of Genz's contribution.
   ``I think any sort of organ donation ... is a valuable,
life-saving procedure.''

   Robert Argyropoulos talked to a machine Tuesday
and the machine talked back, telling the 22-year-old engineering
student the time, reading newspaper articles aloud and dialing a
phone number.
   Its developers say the machine, though still primitive, is the
most promising aid for the blind since the introduction of Braille
160 years ago..
   The Personal Companion, unveiled at a news conference, was
created for the 6.5 million Americans who cannot see well enough to
read or are so handicapped they can't turn a page or punch a
keyboard.
   The machine has the appearance of a computer, but without a
keyboard. It is programmed to respond to the voice of its user.
   Transceptor Technologies Inc., an Ann Arbor, Mich., company
founded in 1986 by people with backgrounds in medicine, visual
rehabilitation, telecommunications, computer design and education,
developed the Personal Companion.
   Argyropoulos, a 22-year-old computer buff, designed the softwear,
working 20 hours to 80 hours a week while a student at the
University of Michigan.
   He said he wanted to build a machine ``not for the superstar
blind person but one that your grandmother could use without knowing
anything about computers.''
   Argyropoulos said 20 minutes of training by the machine, which
gives instructions by voice, are all that's needed to get started.
   Company president Bernard F. McCrory said the machine costs
$6,500 to $6,800. The higher priced model comes with a screen for
the visually impaired on which the type can be made several inches
high.
   McCrory said the machine could be leased by those who can't
afford to buy one.
   Carroll Jackson, director of the Greater Detroit Society for the
Blind and a consultant to the company, called the development
``analogous to the introduction of Braille'' by blind Frenchman
Louis Braille in 1829.
   Jackson, who is legally blind, compared its potential impact to
the introduction of curb cuts that enable people in wheelchairs to
use sidewalks.
   In the voice demonstration, Argyropoulos had the machine do
mathematical computations, record a checkbook transaction _ but not
actually write the check _ tell what was in his appointment ledger
and turn on the radio and the lights.
   At his command, the device called information to get and record a
phone number and then dialed the number.
   By arrangement with the Gannett Co., a condensed version of USA
Today is made available each day over a telephone line. The
machine's synthetic, mechanical sounding voice lists the sections of
the newspaper, recites the headlines and reads abbreviated versions
of stories selected by the user.
   Ultimately, McCrory said, far more information will be available
from computer data banks and the machine will play compact discs,
each capable of reading aloud up to 50 books.
   Company founder Mark Blumenkranz, an ophthalmologist and surgeon
at the Kresge Eye Institute in Detroit, said an engineer who lost
his sight in a hunting accident five years ago consequently lost his
business.
   The engineer has been testing the machine and ``feels he will be
able to go back into business for himself,'' Blumenkranz said.

   New controls on Chinese travel abroad took effect
Tuesday, causing the number of applicants for U.S. visas to plummet.
   Dozens of Chinese had camped outside the U.S. and Canadian
embassies in hopes of getting their visa applications in before the
new rules took effect.
   Among them were doctors, computer scientists and economists, some
of China's best-educated and brightest citizens, all hoping to study
or do research abroad.
   ``We didn't dare leave to eat or sleep for fear of losing our
place in line,'' said an economist who succeeded in applying at the
Canadian Embassy and was waiting outside for a response.
   The revised visa requirements appeared designed to screen
depatures more carefully and prevent fugitive dissidents from
getting out. They came two weeks after the army rolled into Beijing
and opened fired on students and supporters demanding a freer
society.
   There was much confusion about the new regulations.
   Under existing procedure, Chinese are required to obtain exit
permits from their local police stations before Chinese guards
outside foreign embassies allow them to enter to apply for visas.
   According to reports in the official media over the weekend, the
new rules invalidate all permits issued before Tuesday. Through
Monday, Chinese could still use the old permits to enter embassy
grounds, but as of Tuesday the old permits were not good for even
that.
   One radio report and a Chinese source said visa applicants now
must also get a second permit after obtaining the visa. Many Chinese
applicants and several Western consular officials said they did not
know about this requirement and it could not immediately be
confirmed.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Sheridan Bell said only three Chinese
showed up at the consulate Tuesday with the new permit and were
allowed by Chinese guards to apply for visas. By comparison, 350
people applied on Monday, about average for summertime, he said.
   The United States and Canada are two of the most popular
destinations for Chinese traveling abroad for business or study. A
third popular country, Australia, has not reopened its consular
section since closing it after the military crackdown began on June
3.
   Most of those waiting outside the U.S. and Canadian embassies on
Tuesday made plans to go abroad before the crackdown and were not
involved in the protests.
   But they said they feared police would be stingy about issuing
exit permits in the new conservative political climate.
   ``I haven't been in trouble but (Chinese officials) may be
worried about `spiritual pollution,''' said a doctor waiting for a
response to his wife's application to study in Canada.
   Chinese officials refer to unwanted Western cultural influences
and values as spiritual pollution.

<HEAD>Bush Moving on Soviet Policy After Four Months of Study</HEAD>

   President Bush is seeking to take advantage of
new openness in the Kremlin as he forges a Soviet policy designed to
meld Moscow into the international community.
   Bush is on the move now, unveiling new arms negotiating tactics
as well as plans to relax financial strictures on Poland as that
Soviet-bloc nation moves toward democracy.
   But four months of silence at the beginning of the
administration, while the president and his aides conducted a
``strategic review,'' left the impression that the new team was
uncertain how to deal with a volcano of Soviet reform.
   Robert Blackwill, National Security Council staff member for
Soviet and European affairs, and other Bush aides are seeking to
counter that impression.
   ``We know where we want to go,'' Blackwill said. ``We know of the
enormous opportunities that are out there. And we also understand
that if one makes a mistake in an era of transition, that there is
no inevitability for stability in international order, and it could
have a very high price.''
   ``We are trying to create the structure of a relationship that
makes it less likely it can be reversed, less likely that we can
have a return to the sort of conflict we saw in the 1970s and 80s.
And finally, to integrate the Soviet Union into the international
system so that it uses its enormous power to solve international
problems rather than to exploit them,'' Blackwill said in a speech
Tuesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.
   Bush, during a summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
three weeks ago, outlined a plan to rapidly reduce superpower
conventional forces in Europe, surpassing even the proposals of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Some of the fine print of Bush's Soviet-bloc plans, outlined in
broad terms over the past two months, has been disclosed recently
concerning arms negotiating tactics and help for the Polish economy.
   Within a few days, said Blackwill, the administration will
divulge specifics of new proposals in the Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks to test _ with the Soviets _ means of verifying the reduction
or elimination of long-range nuclear weapons.
   The ideas take advantage of apparent new Soviet openness to
verification and are designed to avoid the Senate misgivings that
helped block ratification of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty in
1979 and held up the Intermediate-range Nuclear Force Treaty last
year, said Blackwill.
   ``The purpose of the confidence-building and verification
measures which ... are being conveyed to the Soviets are to
accelerate, not delay, a historic agreement,'' said Blackwill,
declining to specify whether the proposals envision on-site
inspections or satellite surveillance.
   More details of Bush's policy toward Eastern Europe are expected
early next month when Bush travels to Poland and Hungary, two Soviet
bloc nations that Blackwill said are pushing away ``the dead hand of
communism'' with their political and economic reforms.
   ``Some believe that in trying to conceptualize a Soviet-American
relationship through the end of the century, taking four months to
do that, is a long time. I don't how long they take to buy a
house,'' Blackwill said.
   ``We have to keep remembering that dealing with an autocratic
system as exists in the Soviet Union, that reversibility is
possible. We have just seen tragic evidence of that fact in China,''
said Blackwill, referring to the suppression of the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing, in which thousands reportedly died.
   Bush and his top aides have lived most of their adult lives
during the Cold War. Blackwill and his boss, National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft, also served in the White House during
detente, under Presidents Nixon and Ford, when many proclaimed the
end to the Cold War.
   And so they dilute their hope with caution.
   ``I wrote myself the toast that President Nixon gave in Moscow
indicating that detente was irreversible'' in the early 1970's, said
Blackwill. ``It turned out that that wasn't so.''
   ``The danger still exists. ... The Cold War began in Eastern
Europe and it must end there,'' he said, adding that Soviet military
intervention in Poland or Hungary now ``would set back normalization
of East-West relations through the end of the century.''
   ``It is somewhat difficult for me to imagine that the Cold War is
over when today, there are 580,000 members of the Red Army in
Eastern Europe,'' he said. ``After Mr. Gorbachev's unilateral
reductions, which we welcome, which were announced at the United
Nations last December, there will still be 550,000 men of the Red
Army in Eastern Europe. We have a ways to go before the Cold War is
over in Eastern Europe.''

   West Virginia's treasurer announced his
retirement today, averting an impeachment trial on charges he
bungled an investment fund.
   The move preserves A. James Manchin's $2,000-a-month pension,
which he would have lost if convicted by the state Senate next month.
   Manchin announced an end to 41 years of public service at a party
in his office. His retirement is effective July 9, one day before
the trial was to begin.
   ``I cannot in good conscience ask the people of this state to
endure the financial and emotional expenses that would accompany a
lengthy political trial _ and that's what it would be, a political
trial,'' Manchin said.
   The flamboyant Democrat turned 62, making him eligible for an
immediate pension, after he was impeached by the House in March on
17 counts blaming him for an estimated $279 million loss from an
investment fund.
   Lawmakers charged that Manchin didn't know about the losses and
should have, or knew of the losses for more than a year and hid them
from the public.

   They were in hog heaven over at the
World Pork Expo. There was everything a porker could produce: pork
rinds, pork chops and just plain pork. There was even stuff to help
farmers produce plumper profits.
   ``It's so hot it's going to smoke your hair,'' Martin Yan said as
he stirred spicy fried pork and promoted his cookbook. ``God bless
you and all the pigs in the world. Let's all have one pork dish a
day for the next 365 days.''
   About 75,000 people went hog wild at the second annual Expo, a
three-day pork fest that ended Tuesday. Browsers sampled the latest
pork products and hog farmers examined equipment and research aimed
at improving profits.
   ``I enjoyed the Chinese cooking demonstration,'' said Bobbie
Angstrom of Des Moines, Iowa, who accompanied her husband to the
show. ``I'm glad I didn't go to the shopping mall.''
   At a booth operated by Evans Food Products Co., of Chicago, Bill
Connor popped pork rinds into hot oil and cooked them into the snack
President Bush is said to enjoy. Visitors sampled the rinds _ pieces
of hogs' skin _ plain and with barbecue sauce and cheese.
   ``The acceptance of this product since George Bush became
president has been incredible,'' said Connor, whose company's sales
are up 12 percent over 1988.
   Elanco Products, which manufactures medications for livestock,
set up supermarket meat cases to display pork products, and
demonstrated how the meat is cut and trimmed.
   ``The trend now is convenience food,'' said Randy Buller of
Elanco, holding a flat plastic pack with four strips of bacon.
``Here is a big one _ microwave bacon. The pad in there soaks up the
grease.''
   Lloyd Etzler of the Pork Industry Group offered information on
how hogs can be bred to contain less fat, as well as ideas for
cooking pork.
   ``Our main message is that we have a leaner product, and that
pork will work in a well-balanced diet,'' Etzler said. ``I think
we're changing people's attitudes, but not as fast as we'd like.''

   Frank Gasparro's artwork is worth a fortune,
but people drop it on the ground every day one cent at a time and
few bother to pick it up.
   For sentimental reasons, Gasparro usually fetches pennies from
the sidewalk.
   Gasparro designed the tails side of the penny that replaced the
wheat-back penny 30 years ago. His initials can be found just to the
right of the Lincoln Memorial's base.
   Occassionally when he gets a penny in change, he'll point out his
work to the cashier.
   ``They think I'm goofy,'' the former chief engraver of the United
States said. ``I'll say, `I designed it, you can see my initials if
you've got good eyesight.'''
   As the man who designed the Susan B. Anthony dollar, he is the
only living person to have sculpted the front and back of a
general-circulation U.S. coin. He also designed the back of the John
F. Kennedy half dollar.
   Gasparro, who asked a reporter not to write his age, said he is
dissappointed the Susan B. Anthony dollar wasn't more popular. He
figures people just couldn't get used to a dollar that doesn't fold.
   But the back of the penny, which he designed in 1958 and was
first issued in 1959 to mark the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's
birth, is the most circulated of his work.
   When he presented his design to his superiors, they told him to
remove the words ``Lincoln Memorial'' from below the relief of the
building and 13 stars that ran around the outer edge of the coin.
   Gasparro agreed, but refused to take out his initials and the
tiny statue of Lincoln between the sixth and seventh columns, two
features his boss said would look like smudges of dirt.
   ``If you do that, it would look like a library,'' he recalled
saying at the time.
   After 38 years at the mint, Gasparro retired in 1981 and has been
sculpting about 15 to 20 commemorative coins a year for private
groups.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in a rare moment
of candor about his personal life, said Tuesday he was so determined
to come to Jerusalem from Poland in 1935 that he lied to get around
British restrictions.
   Shamir applied and was accepted at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem that year even though he had no plans to study. The
acceptance paved the way for an entry permit from the British.
   ``I decided that this was the only way,'' he said.
   The Polish-born Shamir, who was leader of a militant Jewish
underground and later a senior officer in Israel's Mossad
intelligence service, usually is tight-lipped about his personal
life.
   He was speaking to about 600 Israelis who were among 2,000 Jews
saved from the Nazi Holocaust with the help of acceptance
certificates from the university between 1932 and 1941.
   Many applicants used the certificates to get around immigration
restrictions, said university spokesman Jerry Barrach. The
university was trying to save as many people as possible, but had to
limit the number of certificates because it was being closely
watched by the British, Barrach said.
   In his 1935 application, the 20-year-old Shamir wrote he had
studied law for a year at Warsaw University to please his parents,
but that Hebrew literature was his true love.
   ``After some months of study, it became clear to me that the only
place where I could fully realize my desires and exercise my
abilities would be the Institute for Jewish Studies at the Hebrew
University,'' wrote Shamir, then known as Icko Yezernicki.
   He also wrote that his family was well-off and would support him.
   The letter ``wasn't too accurate a description of my feelings,''
Shamir conceded Tuesday. ``I had to put my family into debt to be
able to immigrate.''
   He said he spent some of his first days in Jerusalem wandering
around campus and sitting in the library.
   ``I wanted to study, also Hebrew literature, but I couldn't
because I had nothing to live on,'' Shamir told reporters, adding
with a smile: ``In the meantime, I got involved in other things.''
   They included joining Irgun Zvi Leumi, a militant Jewish
underground group that fought British mandatory rule in Palestine.
In 1940, he became a founder and leader of the ``Stern Gang'' which
carried out a campaign of political assassinations and bombings of
British installations. In 1948, the United Nations ended the British
mandate and established the state of Israel.
   Asked whether he was sorry he didn't complete his studies, Shamir
said: ``Not at all. I don't regret anything I did.''

   Japan will test for radiation contamination from a
one-megaton nuclear bomb that fell into its waters from a U.S.
aircraft carrier 24 years ago, officials said Tuesday.
   Even if radioactivity is found, however, ``it will be very hard
to distinguish'' whether it came from the lost bomb or from nuclear
tests, said Michiaki Okubo of the Science and Technology Agency's
Nuclear Safety Bureau.
   Japan did not learn until last month that an A-4 Skyhawk plane
carrying a hydrogen bomb rolled off the carrier Ticonderoga on Dec.
5, 1965, about 80 miles from a small island near Okinawa, south of
Japan.
   The bomb and plane settled in the sea bed after its radioactive
material dissolved into the sea water, according to an official U.S.
report released by the Japanese government last month.
   Researchers will take water samples from eight locations and
results may be announced by September, Okubo said.
   ``We will check water samples to learn about the environmental
effects on fish,'' he said.
   Okubo said no samples of earth will be taken from the sea bed
where the bomb sank because scientists have no samples for
comparison.
   Fish samples from the site already have been sent for analysis at
a government research institute by a local government in
southwestern Japan, news reports said. Results should be known by
mid-July.
   Last month, nuclear specialist William Arkin of the
Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies, which released a
declassified U.S. Navy document on the accident, said there is
little danger the bomb could detonate.
   But the 33 pounds of radioactive plutonium in the bomb could
threaten the environment as it deteriorates, he said.
   Opposition parties and some citizens groups charge U.S. Navy
ships routinely visit Japanese ports carrying nuclear bombs in
violation of Japan's non-nuclear policies.

   The Interior Department has acquired 25,000
acres of land in southern Florida for a refuge to protect the
state's threatened panthers, the department said Tuesday.
   The land east of Naples and adjacent to the Big Cypress National
Preserve will be the location of the Florida Panther National
Wildlife Refuge to be managed by Interior's Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   The land was purchased for $10 million. An additional 5,000 acres
will be part of the refuge as a result of land exchange.
   ``The Florida panther is one of our country's most endangered
species. It is a symbol of the wilderness amidst the booming
development of South Florida,'' said Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan.
   The Florida panther is among the most critically endangered
mammals in the country, with only an estimated 30 to 50 animals
remaining.
   The new refuge also will provide habitat for a half dozen other
endangered or threatened species including the wood stork, snail
kite, bald eagle, red-cockaded woodpecker, peregrine falcon and
Eastern indigo snake, officials said.

   Police confirmed that a convicted rapist now in
custody in two attacks is a suspect in at least some the slayings of
19 young women, most of them crack addicts who exchanged sex for
drug money.
   But no new charges have been filed against Charles Henry Williams
and investigators may never have enough evidence, said Metro-Dade
Homicide Cmdr. Wayne McCarthy.
   ``We've exhausted all leads,'' McCarthy said Monday. ``It's not
like anyone has left a calling card or footprint or anything like
that.''
   All but one of the women were found dead in a low-income area of
Miami and neighboring Dade County starting in September 1986. Most
showed signs of recently having had sex, and initially appeared to
have little or no evidence of trauma on their bodies.
   Almost all had traces of cocaine in their blood and were known
for prostitution, police reports said.
   Police are investigating a second suspect in one of the killings,
which occurred while Williams was in jail, and are looking at a
third man as well, but not as seriously, McCarthy said.
   Williams, who served time for rape in the past and is in jail
facing two additional charges, has denied any involvement in the
killings.
   But McCarthy, noting he could only speak for the 11 Dade County
cases, said Williams ``is a main suspect in some of them.''
   Eleven of the killings occurred in Metro-Dade's juristiction,
seven in Miami and one in Hialeah.
   Williams has been linked with four of the dead women, McCarthy
said. ``He knew them, or he dated them or he did drugs with them,''
he said.
   In addition, relatives and friends of one of the Miami victims
have said she knew Williams.
   Since Williams was arrested in early April on the rape charges,
no women have been found dead in the same manner.
   Miami police spokesman Ray Lang said his department's detectives
have little to say about the case.
   ``Our investigators are cooperating with the county in
investigating Charles Williams' alleged connections with any of the
deaths,'' Lang said Tuesday.

   A tearful state Treasurer A. James
Manchin on Tuesday announced his retirement, effective the day
before the state Senate was to consider removing him from office.
   Manchin's decision saves his $2,000-a-month pension, which he
could have lost had he been ousted from office for his role in the
loss of $279 million from an investment fund his office supervised.
   ``I cannot in good conscience ask the people of this state to
endure the financial and emotional expenses that would accompany a
lengthy political trial _ and that's what it would be, a political
trial,'' Manchin, 62, said during a West Virginia Day celebration
marking the state's 126th birthday.
   State Del. Rod Berry, one of the five House of Delegates members
who would have helped present the case against Manchin, said he had
mixed feelings.
   ``I think it may have done the state some good to kind of have a
trial in the case because it would have shown the citizens just
exactly what went on in the treasurer's office and hopefully prevent
it from ever happening again,'' Berry said.
   ``On the other hand, I'm certainly glad we don't have to expend
the state's money to put on this trial.''
   He said the trial would have lasted a month and cost $750,000.
   Another member of the House team, Del. Jim Rowe, said a trial
would have given the state bad publicity.
   ``I'm certainly relieved for his benefit as well as the
state's,'' Rowe said. ``I think as things stood this morning, it was
the honorable thing to do. He should have done it a while back.''
   Manchin said he will concentrate on supporting the Special
Olympics, the Spinal Cord Injury Foundation and Ronald McDonald
houses.
   ``The time for my departure is at hand,'' Manchin said, reading
from his letter to Gov. Gaston Caperton announcing his retirement,
effective July 9. ``I have fought a good fight. I have finished my
course. I have kept the faith.''
   Caperton will appoint a temporary successor to Manchin, and
voters in the 1990 general election will select someone to fill the
remaining two years of Manchin's term, Secretary of State Ken
Hechler said.
   Manchin served in the House of Delegates, as secretary of state
and was elected state treasurer twice.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Allow Marijuana Use by Jamaica-Based Coptic Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday rejected a
claim for a religious exemption to drug laws that would have allowed
the use of marijuana in rites of the Jamaica-based Ethiopian Zion
Coptic Church.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
said in a 2-1 decision that the ``First Amendment's free exercise of
religious guarantee does not require the requested exemption.''
   The court found that Carl Eric Olsen, a self-described priest in
the church who was once convicted of importing 20 tons of marijuana
``was not denied equal protection-establishment clause rights by the
government's refusal to accommodate his church's sacramental use of
marijuna.''
   The panel upheld a decision of the Drug Enforcement
Administration to deny the exemption.
   It noted that Olsen had once been convicted of importing 20 tons
of marijuana, which DEA had called ``an outragous quantity to supply
(his church's) religious needs.''
   According to the court, the religion has up to 2,000 adherents in
Jamaica and no more than 200 in the United States.
   The court, in an opinion by Circuit Judge Ruth B. Ginsburg, said
that granting Olsen the exemption would ``require the government to
make supplies of marijuana available to Olsen's church on a regular
basis.''
   ``We are unaware of any `free exercise' precedent for compelling
government accommodation of religious practices when that
accommodation requires burdensome and constant official supervision
and management,'' Ginsburg wrote in the opinion joined by Circuit
Judge Laurence Silberman.
   Circuit Judge James Buckley filed a dissent, saying DEA had not
adequately explained why it denied Olsen's claim but granted a
religious exemption for the use of peyote to the Native American
Church, an American Indian religion.
   ``This denominational preference constitutes a violation of the
establishment clause'' of the Constitution that bars the government
from setting up an official religion, Buckley said.
   ``The DEA has chosen to accommodate one religion but not
another,'' he wrote. ``The establishment clause compels the agency
to justify its distinction and requires us to scrutinize the
agency's rational strictly.''
   Olsen, reached by telephone at a Marshall, Ark., farm, said he
would seek a rehearing of the case by the full appellate court.
   Olsen, who says he served a five-year prison term for state and
federal marijuana convictions, said he continues to use marijuana
daily but no longer sells it.
   Olsen said marijuana selling had hurt the reputation of the
Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, from which he has dissociated himself.
``We want to make it clear we are not associated with selling
marijuana,'' he said.
   ``The marijuana selling was just something _ a temptation that
came in and overwhelmed people,'' he said.
   Olsen denied that his disaffiliation from the church undermines
his religious claim. ``We're still here for the same thing we came
here for before _ the fellowship.''

   A federal judge today postponed Oliver L.
North's sentencing until July 5 to consider allegations of
misconduct against a juror at the former White House aide's
Iran-Contra trial.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ordered an evidentiary
hearing to be held June 28 and directed court clerks to place
details of the defense allegation on the public record.
   The court papers were to be released later in the day. But it is
understood the defense had raised allegations of misconduct against
juror Tara King, who told reporters after the trial that she had
once used cocaine.
   Ms. King said she did not use cocaine during the eight-week trial.
   Gesell granted a motion by North's lawyers to reconsider his
earlier refusal to hold a closed hearing on the defense allegations.
   Gesell rescheduled the sentencing from Friday until July 5.
   Prosecutors have said North should go to prison because he broke
the law during the Iran-Contra scandal, lied about it during his
trial and still doesn't show ``one iota of remorse.''
   In a sentencing memo likening the fired White House aide to the
corrupt politicians of Tammany Hall, prosecutors say North ``viewed
and continues to view himself as being above the law and beyond
reproach.''
   The former National Security Council aide faces a possible
10-year term for destroying evidence, aiding and abetting the
obstruction of Congress and accepting an illegal gratuity.
   Letting North go without a prison term ``would be a statement
that 15 years after Watergate, government officials can participate
in a brazen cover-up, lie to Congress and collect a substantial
gratuity and still receive only a slap on the wrist,'' prosecutors
told Gesell in their memo Monday.
   ``North's view that anything goes in a political controversy
would be sustained'' by letting him off without a prison sentence,
said the memo signed by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
``Instead, since his acts are a serious breach of the public trust,
they warrant serious punishment.''
   Walsh did not make a specific recommendation of how much time
North should serve in prison. North's lawyers are likely to file a
response to the prosecutor's harsh statement.
   Walsh charged that North concocted a false story to help win
acquittal on a charge that he pocketed $4,300 in travelers checks
entrusted to him by Adolfo Calero, a Nicaraguan Contra leader.
   North's testimony that he purchased a car with $15,000 in cash he
accumulated in a box nailed to his closet floor ``echoed the flimsy
lies offered by corrupt municipal officials in the days of Tammany
Hall,'' Walsh said, in a reference to the New York political machine
which ran the city from the mid-19th century into the 1930s and
became synonymous with graft and fraud.
   Walsh called the steel box story ``preposterous'' and said
``North's perjury represents another indication of his continuing
callous attitude toward the judicial process and our democratic
institutions.''
   Throughout the 12-page memo, Walsh repeated the theme that
``North has not indicated one iota of remorse for having committed
crimes which, because of his position of public trust, jeopardized
the constitutional processes of government.''
   ``He apparently sees nothing wrong with alteration and
destruction of official national security records,'' Walsh said.
   ``His participation in the preparation of a false and misleading
chronology (of U.S.-Iran arms sales) has not led to any
acknowledgement of wrongdoing,'' the prosecutor added.
   ``Certainly he sees nothing wrong with lying to Congress, when in
the view of himself and his superiors lying is necessary,'' Walsh
said. ``North seems to believe that such activities are business as
usual in government or necessary tactics in a `political
firestorm.'''
   North's ``contempt for Congress and the public is accompanied by
venality in financial matters,'' Walsh said of the retired Marine
lieutenant colonel's acceptance of a $13,800 security system from
arms dealer Richard V. Secord, an Iran-Contra co-defendant awaiting
trial.
   Walsh said a prison term is necessary to reduce North's political
following that was cultivated on the lecture circuit and
``reinforces his lack of remorse.''
   Walsh rejected North's contention that he is a scapegoat.
   ``Few criminal defendants have attempted to blame so many others
for so many lawless acts,'' the independent prosecutor said. ``North
must accept his fair share of responsibility.''
   Walsh also disputed North's suggestion at the trial that whatever
he did had the implicit authorization of higher Reagan
administration officials.
   ``This society cannot tolerate government officials unwilling and
unable to exercise independent judgment and responsibility in
refusing to perform illegal acts,'' Walsh said. The sentence should
show that ``one cannot simply rely on real or imagined authorization
of illegal conduct and expect to escape responsibility,'' Walsh said.

<HEAD>Jilted Prom Date Receives Settlement Check</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A girl who was stood up for a high
school prom received a check for $81.28 from her date Tuesday to
settle a dispute she had threatened to drag through small claims
court.
   Tomontra Mangrum, 15, a sophomore, sued Marlon Shadd, 17, a
senior at another school, after he begged off their date claiming he
had an injured ankle.
   ``I feel that this check proves that this was not silly at all,''
she said at a news conference. ``I did what I had to do, and I'm
proud of it.''
   The sum represented $49.53 for new shoes, a hairdo and flowers
Ms. Mangrum bought for prom night, $19.50 to file the case in small
claims court and $12.25 to have the lawsuit officially served.
   Shadd's view of the case, which he said he settled only to end
the dispute, was different from hers.
   ``It's just stupid,'' he said Monday. ``She's just freaking out.
I don't know what's wrong with her.''
   Ms. Mangrum said she was trying to make a point about taking
young people seriously.
   ``Always be truthful, especially with people my age,'' she said.
``It's a lot harder on young people.''
   She said she has continued to date since the suit, and laughed
when asked if her current dates worry she might sue them as well.
   ``Yes they do,'' she said. ``I hear them say, `I wouldn't stand
you up like that.'''
   Shadd said he's not angry with Ms. Mangrum for suing him. But he
still maintains he called her a week before the prom to say he had
hurt his ankle and would not be able to take her.
   The Mangrums admit he called, but insist he did not break the
date.
   Shadd and Ms. Mangrum have not spoken since the suit was filed,
according to Valerie Mangrum, Tomontra's mother.
   ``He has refused to apologize to her, but she felt like the check
was apology enough,'' Mrs. Mangrum said.

<TEXT>
   The son of Prime Minister Olof Palme
testw the slaying suspect, defendant Carl Gustaf Christer
Pettersson, in a police lineup ``I was shocked ... because the man I
saw was so similar to the picture I had in my mind.''
   Palme, the dominant figure in Swedish politics for more than a
decade, was killed Feb. 28, 1986, as he and his wife, Lisbeth,
walked home from a late movie.
   Pettersson has denied shooting the prime minister.
   The prosecution has accused Pettersson, 42, of waiting for Palme
to emerge from the theater, following the couple for several hundred
yards, then shooting the Swedish leader.
   Marten Palme, a 28-year-old sociologist, said he noticed a man
who looked like Pettersson as he and his girlfriend left his parents
after discussing the film they had just seen together.
   ``I saw him looking at my parents intently. It's possible that he
followed them, but I'm not sure,'' he told the court.
   But under questioning from defense attorney Arne Liljeros, the
younger Palme said he had compared memories of the man's appearance
with his mother's recollections several times since the shooting.
   Also Tuesday, witness Lars-Erik Eriksson told the court that he
had seen a man who looked like Pettersson as Eriksson waited in a
car for his parents to come out of the theater.
   ``I got a little frightened,'' said Eriksson, 29. ``I even locked
the car doors, and I thought it's better not to look too much at
him. This person can explode soon.''
   Asked if he was certain Pettersson was the man he saw, Eriksson
replied, ``Can you ever be 100 percent sure? But I am very sure.''
   Birgitta Wennerling, a 47-year-old painter, said she noticed a
suspicious man as she left an earlier showing of the film.
   He was straining to see over people's heads into the lobby, she
said and ``had a sick, horrid look.'' She and Eriksson independently
picked out Pettersson in police lineups.
   The trial adjourned until Wednesday.
   In a dramatic courtroom confrontation on Monday, Mrs. Palme
pointed to Pettersson and said she was ``absolutely certain'' he was
the man she saw nearby as her husband collapsed with a fatal bullet
wound.
   Mrs. Palme's testimony was crucial for the prosecution, which has
suffered setbacks in trying to establish a motive and breaking the
defendant's alibi.
   Prosecutors have no murder weapon and no witness who saw
Pettersson with a gun in his hand.
   Mrs. Palme said she looked at Pettersson three times after the
shooting, at first for help. The prosecution has claimed no one else
was on the scene who could have shot Palme.

   The state forestry director says he's
excited by a judge's decision to require a man convicted of setting
a forest fire to spend 10 days fighting fires.
   ``We're going to be trying to do this every time we turn around
now. Absolutely,'' said William Gillespie, director of the state
forestry division.
   Ralph Brewster Jr., 49, of Delbarton was sentenced after pleading
guilty to setting a fire that destroyed 12,000 acres in the
Delbarton area in November 1987, state forester Coy Mullins said.
   In addition to a 10-day jail sentence, a $500 fine and the 10-day
fire-fighting detail, Brewster also was placed on two years'
probation, Mullins said Monday.
   Brewster initially was charged with setting fire to property
owned by someone else, a felony, and pleaded guilty to destruction
of property, a misdemeanor, the Mingo County circuit clerk's office
said.
   Brewster was sentenced May 22, but Mullins said his office just
learned of the plea and the sentence last week. There was no answer
at Brewster's home.

<HEAD>Group Says Proposed New-Style Reactors Won't Help Global Warming
Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nuclear industry's proposed new-generation
reactors, designed to operate more reliably and safely, will not be
available soon enough to help the global warming problem, an
anti-nuclear group said in a report Tuesday.
   The Safe Energy Communication Council said the nuclear industry
was misleading the public by billing the advanced-design reactors as
a partial solution to global atmospheric warming caused by emissions
from fossil fuel plants.
   ``Nuclear power offers a `fools gold' solution to global
warming,'' said Scott Denman, the group's director.
   Alex Antypas, a researcher at the council, said it's too early to
tell whether new reactor designs will prove better and more economic
than the current generation.
   ``It will take at least 10 years to develop and build a single
demonstration plant, and another two or more decades to bring many
of those plants on line,'' Antypas said.
   The proposed new reactors would rely heavily on ``passive''
design features to guard against a melting of the reactor core. A
gas-cooled reactor, for example, uses helium as a coolant instead of
water and its core is encased in graphite. This gives its operators
more time to respond to problems because the gas cannot boil away
and the graphite takes hours to reach a dangerous temperature.
   Antypas said that even if the advanced-design reactors prove more
safe and reliable than the current light-water reactors, the
industry still will not have solved the problem of long-term
disposal of wastes generated by the plants.
   The group said more emphasis should be placed on improving energy
efficiency in transportation, buildings, appliances and utilities
instead of spending billions on new nuclear plants.
   Many in the nuclear industry believe that widespread adoption of
the new reactor technologies is vital to restoring public confidence
in the safety and efficiency of nuclear power.

   The House Ways and Means Committee today
approved trade concessions for Poland and Hungary, two Soviet-bloc
nations that President Bush will visit next month.
   With no debate or dissent, the committee agreed to a bill that
makes exports from Poland eligible for duty-free treatment under the
Generalized System of Preferences.
   The House quickly gave the measure approval by voice vote and
sent it to the Senate.
   A second bill approved by the Ways and Means Committee by voice
vote would allow a five-year extension of most-favored-nation trade
status to Hungary. That has the effect of suspending a law that bars
trade concessions to certain communist nations until the United
States is satisfied they have liberalized emigration policies.
   That 1974 law, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, usually
requires that any exemption be reviewed every year. Rep. Richard
Schulze, R-Pa., complained because the suspension for Hungary's
benefit would be subject to a review only after five years.
   ``We take a very important step when we change Jackson-Vanik,''
Schulze said. ``It's symbolic around the world.''
   Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., who chairs the committee's trade
subcommittee, said the five-year suspension is justified because no
emigration complaints against Hungary are pending. ``Hungary, of all
nations, has demonstrated its continued interest in freedom,'' he
said.
   Few American investors are willing to put their money into
Hungary and take the risk of having the United States withdraw trade
concessions after only a year, Gibbons added.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the committee, said it
is expected that Congress will complete action on the concessions
this week.

   Bich Nguyen spoke almost no English and was too
afraid to talk when she entered South Boston High School two years
ago. Now she's at the head of her class and among a remarkable array
of this year's valedictorians at Boston high schools.
   The list includes students born in Vietnam, China, El Salvador,
Cape Verde, Jamaica, Italy and Czechoslovakia. One of the four
U.S.-born graduates among the 17 scholars is a ward of the state.
   The explanation for the unusual mix lies in a lot of new faces in
the city and a lot of old values, educators say.
   ``When you've been running for your life in the jungles just to
get your freedom, you're not looking for the good life; you're
looking for survival. They come in and they're willing to do
anything and work anywhere. It's the same with all immigrants,''
Jerome Winegar, principal of the 900-student South Boston High
School, said Tuesday.
   Duc Hoang Vo, valedictorian at the 1,000-student Boston Technical
High School, was beaten by Thai pirates when his family fled Vietnam
by boat. His sister was kidnapped during the voyage.
   He said he had to do well; he owed his family.
   ``When my (parents) left their country they left everything
behind,'' said Vo, 18, who emigrated seven years ago. ``They dropped
everything at once, including my grandmother, just to give us a
better future.''
   ``Being a minority, I work harder for a better future, success
and to make my parents proud,'' said Vo, who will study medical
engineering on a full scholarship at Boston University this fall.
   Nguyen's family also made some wrenching decisions to get her
into an American school.
   Nguyen, who has a full scholarship to Emmanuel College, came here
with her father. Her mother, two brothers and a sister were left
behind in Vietnam because there wasn't enough money for all of them
to emigrate.
   She and her father floated seven days and nights without food or
water before they were picked up by an American ship.
   She said she wants from an education what she and her father, who
was imprisoned for several years after the fall of Saigon, could not
get in Vietnam.
   ``Money is important but I want to have the power of knowledge,''
said Nguyen. ``The knowledge can do something the money can't do. It
can get respect from other people.''
   She earned it in South Boston, site of many bitter racial clashes
during forced busing of the 1970s.
   Rolando Cabrera, 17, said he and his family felt they could not
make enough money in El Salvador, and his parents did not want their
three sons serving in the army.
   He said he learned good work habits in his home country, where
teachers and education are widely respected. He is headed for the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Massima Chiocca, 17, of East Boston High School, said he'd
noticed the high number of foreign-born students who were
valedictorians this year.
   Chiocca, whose family came to the United States from Italy about
three years ago, said Americans might be taking their education for
granted.
   ``Seems like people from other countries are taking over this
place. I'm one of them, but there's enough space for a lot of
people,'' he said.
   ``Since I started school in first grade my mother always pushed
me to do my best,'' said Chiocca, who will attend Harvard University
in the fall.
   Clarice Pereira, 22, a deaf immigrant from Cape Verde, a former
Portuguese colony off the coast of Africa, spoke only Portuguese
when she arrived in 1982, said Carol Donohoe, an adviser at the
Horace Mann School for the Deaf.
   ``They come here and see the possibilities and they know it means
work if they want to succeed,'' Donohoe said.

   Nicholas Benton, the designer and builder
of the ``Half Moon,'' a full-size replica of Henry Hudson's
17th-century exploration ship, died when the mast of a boat he was
working on collapsed. He was 35.
   Benton, of Middletown, R.I., was working Monday morning in the
Port of Rensselaer along the Hudson River when a mast snapped on the
schooner ``Domino Effect'' and Benton fell 75 feet to the deck.
   He later died of ``shock and hemorrhage due to multiple trauma''
at Albany Medical Center, according to Barbara Cavanaugh,
confidential secretary to the Albany County coroner. Benton died on
his birthday.
   A master ship-rigger and founding member of the Colonial Maritime
Association, Benton is survived by a wife, Debbie, and three
preschool-aged sons, Carol McLeod of McLeod Public Relations of
Albany said.
   McLeod is publicist for the $1 million Half Moon project which is
aiming to teach Americans about the accomplishments of Hudson and of
people of Dutch heritage in America. She said the project would
continue.
   The 85-foot, 120-ton Half Moon took about a year to build. It was
christened June 10 at the Port of Albany and is to begin a goodwill
voyage to several Northeastern ports on July 5.
   At the christening ceremonies, Benton told a crowd of about 500
people that ``what the sea separates, the shipbuilder unites.''
   Ernest Cowan, who has been responsible for the woodworking on the
``Half Moon'' replica, arrived Monday in Albany to take over the
project, McLeod said.
   The ship Benton was working on at the time of his death was a
175-foot schooner owned by Domino's Pizza Inc.

<HEAD>Emigre Artist Returns for Lecture</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sculptor and philosopher Ernst Neizvestny, who
emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1976, said Tuesday that Karl Marx
was a good critic of 19th century capitalism but a bad prophet.
   Neizvestny, who gained fame for his differences over art with
former Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev, spoke to about 500 people
as part of a Moscow Summer School series of lectures on democracy,
freedom and free-market economics.
   The artist did not elaborate on Marx, whose prediction that
capitalism will inevitably self-destruct into communism is taught to
every schoolchild in the Soviet Union. The audience responded to the
comment with quiet laughter and grunts of acknowledgement.
   Neizvestny had a rocky relationship with Khrushchev. They met
when the Soviet leader came to a rare exhibition of modern art and
termed Neizvestny's work ``garbage.'' The sculptor strode up and
started arguing.
   Khrushchev later asked Neizvestny to create his grave monument,
which marks the final resting place of the former Soviet leader in
Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.
   The 64-year-old sculptor told his audience the flood of famous
Soviet artists and performers who have left their homeland will stop
when they are certain they can leave the Soviet Union and know they
can return _ and then leave again.
   ``I always had a fear of being parochial,'' for lack of the
ability to travel, he said. Emigration clearly solved that, he said.
   But he also found that his life in the Soviet Union left him
afraid only of prison and death, so less-serious difficulties such
as poverty or the opinions of others have had little effect.
   The lecture was arranged by the American Foreign Policy Council
and a group seeking to establish an American university in Moscow.

<TEXT>
   A House committee on Tuesday passed legislation
that would limit civil contempt of court jailings in the District of
Columbia, a bill designed to help a mother who has been jailed 22
months in a child custody dispute.
   Elizabeth Morgan, a prominent plastic surgeon, was jailed by D.C.
Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon after she refused to tell him
where she had sent her six-year-old daughter Hilary. He has said
repeatedly he will not lift his contempt citation until she gives
the information.
   Morgan has been trying to prevent any visit between the child and
Eric Foretich, the girl's father. Morgan has accused Foretich, her
former husband, of sexually abusing the child; he has repeatedly
denied it.
   The legislation, designed to apply retroactively to Morgan's
case, would limit civil contempt jailings in the district to 12
months, unless the judge in the case changes the charge to criminal
contempt, a charge that would require a trial. People could be held
on criminal contempt charges during the trial, but not longer than
18 months.
   The bill also requires that a different judge hear the criminal
contempt charges.
   ``We do not seek to place a limitation on the amount of time an
individual can be sentenced to serve if convicted of criminal
contempt,'' said Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a co-sponsor of the bill
passed by the District of Columbia Committee. ``Our aim was to
preserve the basic right of individuals to due process under the
law.''
   Nine of the members of the committee voted for the legislation,
with only Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., voting against it. Parris
said the legislation is expected to go before the full House next
week.
   The panel's action came a day after Dixon ruled again that the
mother must remain behind bars until she discloses the whereabouts
of her daughter or turns the child over to the city's foster care
department.
   A District of Columbia Appeals Court panel had directed Dixon to
justify his December 1988 decision to keep Morgan in jail.
   Dixon's latest ruling will now be reviewed by that three-judge
panel.
   Foretich's attorney, Elaine Mittleman, said Tuesday in a
statement, ``Civil contempt does not transform into criminal
contempt. ... A crime such as obstruction of justice is much more
suited to Dr. Morgan's offenses than is criminal contempt.''

<HEAD>States Oppose Measures to Make Them Expand Eligibility</HEAD>

   Physicians and children's advocates told
Congress on Tuesday that making more women eligible for Medicaid
prenatal care would help reduce the nation's high rate of infant
deaths.
   However, the states, which share the cost of the health insurance
program for the poor with the federal government, opposed measures
backed by the administration and members of Congress requiring
states to expand eligibility in their Medicaid programs.
   The administration is proposing to require states to admit to
their Medicaid programs women and infants with incomes up to 130
percent of poverty. Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and John Chafee,
R-R.I., introduced a bill Monday to require coverage for women and
children up to 185 percent of poverty.
   The need for prenatal care to reduce infant mortality ``has to be
one of the nation's most pressing problems,'' Bentsen said at
Tuesday's hearing of the Senate Finance Committee, which he chairs.
   ``White American babies now die at a greater rate than babies
born in Singapore,'' he said. ``Minority babies born in Washington
today have a greater chance of dying before their first birthday
than babies in Cuba.''
   The U.S. infant mortality rate ranks 20th among industrialized
nations, according to the Public Health Service.
   A third of all pregnant women are not receiving prenatal care,
Bentsen said, and one in five children have no health insurance.
   ``The best way to ensure that a child will begin life as healthy
as possible is to ensure the health of the mother during pregnancy
through prenatal care,'' said Kay Johnson of the Children's Defense
Fund.
   Richard H. Schwarz of the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists said the evidence is overwhelming that prenatal care
reduces low birthweight. This condition, he said, is associated with
two-thirds of neonatal deaths and 20 percent of postnatal deaths.
   Yet, Medicaid falls far short of meeting the health-care needs of
poor women and children, witnesses said.
   Current law gives states until July 1, 1990, to cover all
pregnant women and infants with incomes below the poverty line.
   Forty-four states now provide coverage to pregnant women and
infants with family income below the poverty line, and 15 states
provide such coverage for women and infants with incomes up to 185
percent of poverty, according to the National Governors' Association.
   Bentsen's measure would require coverage for pregnant women and
children up to age 6 with incomes below 185 percent of poverty, or
$22,385 for a family of four, by Jan. 1, 1991. It would add 300,000
women and 1.6 million children.
   The change would cost about $1 billion annually, a cost that
would have to be matched by the states.
   The administration's proposal would add a total of 374,000 women
and children to the program and would pay for the change by reducing
state matching funds for administrative costs.
   The states, however, oppose ``any further mandated eligibility
requirements in the Medicaid program,'' said Raymond C. Scheppach,
executive director of the National Governors' Association.
   In the last year and a half, states have had to absorb the costs
of sweeping changes in nursing home care and expanded benefits for
the elderly, he said.
   Yet, states voluntarily have been moving to expand their Medicaid
programs to make more women, infants and children eligible for
benefits and will continue to make improvements as their budgets
allow, he said.
   ``Individual states are in the best position to decide how
Medicaid funds should be spent to assist citizens who are in need,''
he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Arms Negotiator: Soviets More Willing to Allow Verification</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Soviet, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush welcomes the Soviet Union's
increased willingness to allow verification of nuclear weapons
reductions and plans to build on that in new initiatives, the chief
U.S. negotiator said Tuesday.
   Negotiator Richard Burt declined to discuss Bush's proposals in
detail, but said ``we have noticed that the Soviets have taken a
much more open and constructive approach on verification in recent
years.''
   Bush's proposal came Monday in Washington as the superpowers
resumed Strategic Arms Reduction Talks in Geneva after a seven-month
recess.
   The president said the United States and Soviet Union should
begin testing verification procedures during negotiations on
reducing long-range nuclear forces, rather than waiting until a pact
is completed.
   Such steps could involve trial inspections at each other's
missile sites and discussions about equipment needed for
verification, which Bush said could be the most complex issue facing
negotiators.
   Tuesday's editions of The Washington Post quoted an unidentified
official in Washington as saying negotiators plan to suggest
around-the-clock monitoring of some ballistic missile factories and
on-site checks of missile warheads, to start before any new
agreement. The proposal also was reported to include a ban on some
missile flight tests.
   Burt said that another aim of Bush's plan is to build support for
Senate ratification of a future arms treaty.
   Several superpower arms control treaties, including the 1979 SALT
II pact on limiting long-range nuclear arsenals, remained unratified
because the Senate decided the verification provisions were lax.
   Burt said progress on verification would not become a condition
in the START talks.
   ``We will continue to move on all fronts,'' he said. ``We are not
proposing these measures as a take-it-or-leave-it package.''
   The talks, aimed at reducing U.S. and Soviet long-range bombers,
missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent, are the
latest round in negotiations that began four years ago.
   Burt said at the news conference that their aim is to ``speed
resolution of outstanding issues and give added momentum'' toward
completing a treaty.
   Under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's philosophy of more
openness, Moscow has allowed Western experts to tour a Soviet
chemical weapons site for the first time as part of efforts to
negotiate a global ban.
   U.S. and Soviet scientists also have exchanged visits to each
other's nuclear testing sites to examine ways of monitoring two
1970s treaties limiting atomic blasts that the Senate never approved.
   Burt confirmed that the Bush administration's review of arms
policy did not result in a change in the Strategic Defense
Initiative, which calls for space-based missile defenses, a divisive
issue since arms talks began.
   He rejected Soviet attempts to link a START treaty to agreement
on what Washington says would be crippling curbs on SDI.
   On Monday, Yuri Nazarkin, head of the Soviet delegation to the
talks, met with Burt for 80 minutes at the U.S. Mission.
   Nazarkin spoke of ``a good start'' and held out the prospect of
unspecified Soviet initiatives.
   The talks are to last six to seven weeks.
   In detailed negotiations starting Wednesday with a full meeting
of both delegations, Burt will lead the U.S. team and Lem Masterkov
will continue as Soviet negotiator under Nazarkin.
   Disputes have developed over Moscow's demand for including
sea-based cruise missiles in the treaty and Washington's call for a
ban on mobile missiles.
   At earlier talks boths sides agreed to lower ceilings of 6,000
nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles and bombers
_ for each side.

   Afghan secret police Tuesday
interrogated an American photographer captured while traveling with
Moslem guerrillas, diplomatic sources said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani confirmed an
American was being interrogated for his ``ill intentions.''
   ``He is being interrogated in Kabul, but we would like to assure
that there will be no violent actions against him.'' Amani said the
American entered Afghanistan illegally.
   Free-lance photographer Tony O'Brien of Santa Fe, N.M., was
caught Wednesday in Kabul, guerrilla sources in Pakistan said.
O'Brien, 43, is with Picture Group photo agency and was on
assignment for Life magazine.
   ``We were told he probably was arrested for illegally entering
the country,'' said the agency's president, Don Abood. ``He had no
visa. He probably went in through Pakistan and got caught. We're not
sure what the circumstances were.''
   He said O'Brien had been covering the Afghan war from the
Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar.
   Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said
O'Brien was being questioned by the Afghan secret police, called
Khad, in one of their offices in the capital.
   Amani said the American entered Afghanistan without valid travel
documents. ``It is our right to arrest him,'' he said. ``We are
allowing journalists to come to Afghanistan and stay here. Why did
he choose to come in company of terrorists? This gives us a right to
assume that he is a saboteur, he may even be a spy.''
   Amani said the prisoner was in good health and his family had
approached the Afghan Embassy in Washington.
   ``But we have no other contacts with the United States
government,'' he said.
   Washington closed its embassy in Kabul last winter, citing fears
of a bloodbath after the Soviet army ended nine years of involvement
in the war and left Afghanistan in February.
   In the past five years, seven foreigners have been arrested in
Afghanistan, according to Amani. He said five were journalists and
two were West German physicians. All were released after their
countries intervened, Amani said.
   The guerrillas have been fighting the Soviet-backed Kabul
government for 11 years with help mainly from the United States and
Pakistan.
   O'Brien had made several trips into Afghanistan with the
guerrillas and his photographs have appeared in major U.S.
publications.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Accepts Cheney Procurement Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Armed Services subcommittee voted
Tuesday to accept Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's $69 billion
procurement budget with no add-ons, endorsing a proposal from the
panel's Democratic chairman by a slim margin.
   The procurement and military nuclear systems subcommittee, by a
vote of 10-9, approved the amendment of Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., who
had urged members to give Cheney a vote of confidence and prevent
add-ons totaling $7.2 billion.
   The full House Armed Services Committee will vote on the
amendment next week.
   ``While the budget may not be perfect, it's a darn good product _
especially given the 39 days Dick Cheney had to put it together,''
Aspin told the panel.
   Aspin and two other Democrats _ Ike Skelton of Missouri and
Richard Ray of Georgia _ joined seven of the panel's eight
Republicans in approving the measure.
   Rep. Robert W. Davis of Ohio was the lone GOP member to vote
against the plan, which basically removes the right of members to
rewrite the $300 billion fiscal 1990 budget to restore local
projects canceled by Cheney.
   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said he was pleased to hear about
the vote.
   Aspin refused to give odds on the measure's chance of winning
approval in the full committee, but called the subcommittee's
acceptance of a budget that terminates programs ``staggering.''
   Some Democratic members complained that approval of the measure
could signal the end of the subcommittee's authority.
   ``A yes vote ... would be abrogating ourselves out of business,''
said Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., who voted against the amendment.
   Rep. Norman Sisisky, D-Va., who also opposed the amendment, said
approval was not a vote of confidence for Cheney because there was
no guarantee that the defense budget wouldn't be changed on the
House floor.
   ``I think I'm giving up my rights if I have to vote for something
that I can only change on the floor,'' Sisisky said. ``I think we're
making a big mistake and it has nothing to do with a vote of
confidence.''
   Some members have pressed for restoring the Navy F-14D Tomcat
fighter and Marine V-22 Osprey, which Cheney canceled, at the
expense of other projects. If restored, the F-14D would add $366
million and the V-22 $700 million.
   Other possible add-ons include $55 million in new equipment for
the Navy P-3 anti-submarine aircraft, $436 million for Air Force
C-130s and $240 million for heavy trucks made in Oshkosh, Wis.
   McCloskey argued that although Aspin didn't strong-arm his
Democratic colleagues on the amendment, ``there are people on that
side who are very much for the Osprey that ... have been
strong-armed by the secretary of defense.''
   Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn., said ``no one on this side of the
aisle was strong-armed.''
   Cheney, former House Republican whip who served as representative
from Wyoming, has the ``mildest, softest touches on the Hill,''
Rowland said.
   Aspin said after the vote that lobbying was fierce on both sides,
with President Bush and the Northrop Corp. pushing for adoption of
the amendment.
   Northrop, which manufactures the B-2 stealth bomber, fears losing
funds for its program to support other defense projects.
   Lobbying against the plan were Grumman Corp., builder of the
F-14, and the alumni association of the Marine Corps, backers of the
V-22 Osprey.
   Shortly after the vote, Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., said he
would fight to save the F-14, which is manufactured in Bethpage,
Long Island.

   The Navy has accepted the city's invitation
to reschedule a mock beach assault that was canceled after religious
and peace groups opposed it.
   The City Council, after hearing emotional testimony during a
meeting Monday night, voted 6-3 to extend the invitation.
   Lt. Commander Luanne Smith, executive officer of the Navy
Recruiting District in Minneapolis, said Tuesday the Navy will
contact city officials soon about reviving the Park Point mock
assault.
   The exercise involving 200 Marines was to be part of a recruiting
and goodwill visit July 21-23 by the Boulder, a tank landing ship.
   City Council President Joyce Benson and members of several
religious and peace groups earlier had persuaded the Navy to cancel
the show. Many had complained that it would glorify war and damage
the Lake Superior beach.
   The council's action followed emotional testimony by veterans and
peace activists.
   Those in favor of the mock assault argued that the military needs
such exercises to train. Some said such shows instill valuable pride
in the military, enhance recruiting and demonstrate strength.
   ``If you're strong, nobody will muck around with you,'' said
veteran Harvey Solon.
   Those against the assault said it would glorify violence, falsely
advertise military jobs as glamorous and advocate wasting money that
could be spent on social needs.
   ``The real issue is political,'' said veteran Mark Skinner.
``This is a demonstration on the part of the Pentagon to get support
for military spending.''

   A consultant with ties to former President Reagan
helped a Minnesota housing project secure funding last year after
federal housing officials rejected the plan, a newspaper reported
today.
   The consultant, Robert Weinberger, is a nephew of former Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and was an aide to Reagan when he was
governor of California, The New York Times reported.
   Weinberger told the Associated Press Tuesday he hadn't done
anything out of the ordinary in approaching lawmakers on behalf of
the developer, and rejected implications he used personal influence
on behalf of his client.
   Robert Weinberger is the latest on a growing list of prominent
Republicans who successfully represented developers seeking help
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Times said.
   The Times said documents show that after the HUD office in
Minneapolis rejected a plan for the agency to provide mortgage
insurance for a $5 million housing project for the elderly in St.
Paul, a handwritten note from HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce on Aug.
23 said his senior staff would give ``very careful consideration''
to an appeal from the developers.
   The note responded to a letter dated Aug. 22 from Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., who had asked Pierce to reconsider the project.
   Less than two weeks later, the documents showed, the Minneapolis'
office decision was reversed.
   Weinberger said he asked several elected officials, including
both Minnesota senators and a congressman to query HUD about the
case, and said that is standard procedure for a consultant seeking
review of a project.
   ``The implication is that I called my uncle and he called
Pierce,'' Weinberger told the Associated Press. ``That's garbage. I
never talked to my uncle on that trip. We talk but it's always about
family matters _ we have an unwritten rule about that.''
   Weinberger said he contacted Wilson's staff because the
California senator serves on the Select Committee on Aging, and
because he knows Wilson.
   Weinberger said he and his firm in Laguna Niguel, Calif.,
received about $15,000 in fees for its work on the project.
   Weinberger, who said his share of the fee was ``a few thousand
dollars,'' said his firm does consulting and lobbying work for
health care businesses, mostly with the state Legislature but also
in Washington.
   ``We were hired not for influence, but for our understanding of
the process,'' he said.
   Developer Richard L. Webb said he and his partners hired
Weinberger to get ``some political influence, some political
interest in our appeal so that the HUD people would consider it.''
   The Minneapolis HUD office rejected the project because of what
officials there said was a relatively weak market for housing for
the elderly.
   The 68-unit project, a blend of apartment buildings and a
convalescent hospital now under construction, is called Rosewood
Estates.

<TEXT>
   Francisco Street residents are tired of
living in fear because of rampant drug dealing and prostitution in
their neighborhood. So they're fighting back _ in small claims court.
   Fifteen homeowners and renters have filed mental anguish claims
for $2,000 each against the owner of the five-unit apartment
building residents contend is the wellspring of neighborhood crime,
illicit sex and drugs, all linked to sales of cheap, potent crack
cocaine.
   Instead of soda cans and drifting newspapers, the neighborhood of
modest Victorians and new condominiums has been littered with used
syringes and condoms.
   ``I can't walk down the street anytime,'' said Elisa Flores, 18.
``People think I'm a prostitute.''
   Her 15-year-old brother was robbed at gunpoint. One neighbor
found a bloody syringe next to his child's swing. A second
encountered a prostitute having sex on a picnic bench outside his
back door at noon.
   Kenneth Martin, who has lived in the area for four years, said
the neighborhood was being ruined by drug dealing on the sidewalks
and prostitution in the schoolyard, constant traffic and the sounds
of fighting inside two apartments linked to narcotics sales.
   ``Our purpose is not to gouge anyone for lots of money, but to
get the criminality removed,'' Martin said.
   Bonnie Perocier, who has lived on Francisco Street for 29 years,
said her car has been broken into twice and items have been stolen
from her garage. She said a man across the street was burglarized
twice by thieves who ripped his deadbolt locks off with crowbars.
   ``He came back Sunday morning and even his underwear was gone,
and he was wondering what he was going to wear to work,'' Perocier
said.
   Residents say the drug and crime problems have grown worse in the
past year and a half.
   The small claims filed in Berkeley-Albany Municipal Court blame
the apartment building owner for negligence, creating a nuisance and
endangering the neighborhood. Judge Jennie Rhine will receive final
evidence in the case Wednesday and will rule later.
   Martin said the small claims idea stemmed from news about a
successful lawsuit by South San Francisco homeowners against airport
officials who promised to abate noise but failed to follow through.
   Police spokesman Capt. Bobby Miller said the two-story apartment
building in the middle of the block is well-known to police, who
have served search warrants and made arrests there.
   Molly Wetzel, who lives across the street, said she contacted
owner Percy Davis about the problems there several times since last
October.
   Davis' attorney, Michael Sims, contends Davis filed a notice on
April 18 to evict the alleged trouble-makers. Sims said Davis
complained that Berkeley's strict rent control law makes eviction
difficult.
   About the troublesome tenants, Sims said Davis isn't ``accepting
any responsibility for their criminal behavior.''
   Repeated calls to Davis were not returned.
   Martin said the apartment tenants have been evicted or have
agreed to move soon. ``All we know is that the problem is at last
being solved,'' he said.
   ``I know Mr. Davis now has promised to clean this situation up,
but the time it has taken has ruined our lives,'' said the resident
who found the bloody syringe. He did not want to be identified.
   The neighborhood, in Berkeley's flatlands about a mile west of
the University of California campus, has long had crime problems
because of a busy thoroughfare nearby. Residents acknowledge that
getting new neighbors in the apartment building won't eliminate all
of their problems, but it will help.
   ``We will not do away with the petty kind of burglary that you
have everywhere in West Berkeley, but the problems of prostitution
and fear on the street definitely will go away,'' Martin said. ``If
it can stay clean a year, I believe it will be solved.''

<HEAD>House Approves Extension of Reserve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday approved an eight-month
extension of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the nation's energy
life jacket in the event of a repeat of the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
   On a voice vote, the House authorized the Energy Department to
continue filling the reserve with 60,000 to 78,000 barrels of oil
daily through next February, but postponed decisions on several key
issues on how the stockpile may be used.
   The Senate approved similar legislation two weeks ago, but
extended the program for another five years and raised the ceiling
on the reserve from 750 million barrels to 1 billion barrels early
in the next century.
   In response to oil price surges after the Exxon Valdez tanker
spill in Alaska two months ago, the Senate also expanded President
Bush's authority to tap the reserve for domestic as well as foreign
supply interruptions.
   The House included none of those measures in its bill, saying it
wanted to give its Energy and Commerce Committee as well as the
Energy Department time to weigh the implications of any new policy
directions.
   If the Senate refuses to accept the House-passed bill, a
conference committee would be named to develop a compromise version.
If both chambers approve the compromise, the legislation would be
sent to Bush.
   While endorsing the effort to give Bush more authority and
flexibility on when he could tap the reserve in order to suppress
sudden price spikes for oil, the administration had sought only a
simple five-year extension of the program.
   Since the reserve was begun in 1975, some 570 million barrels of
oil _ slightly less than a 90-day supply of U.S. imports at current
levels _ have been put into storage in salt caverns on the Texas and
Louisiana coasts.

   Adrienne Brown, wife of jailed soul singer
James Brown, was placed on five years' probation and fined $5,000
Tuesday after pleading guilty to a drug charge.
   She also was ordered to continue with drug and alcohol screening.
   Mrs. Brown, 39, was arrested in May of last year as she got off a
plane at Bush Field in Augusta and charged with possessing the drug
PCP. She had been arrested on a similar charge six weeks earlier.
One of two charges was dropped when she pleaded guilty to the other.
   Brown, 56, is serving a six-year sentence at the State Park
Correctional Center near Columbia, S.C., for trying to run over two
policemen during a two-state auto chase last fall.
   Brown, known as the ``Godfather of Soul,'' is serving a
concurrent six-year term in Georgia for carrying a weapon to a
public gathering and driving under the influence of PCP. He is
eligible for parole in May 1991.

   Pamela Harriman, wife of the late Ambassador W.
Averell Harriman, will give Vincent van Gogh's ``Roses'' to the
National Gallery of Art, the gallery director said Tuesday.
   The painting, which Mrs. Harriman valued at $50 million to $60
million, will be the first van Gogh still life to join the National
Gallery's permanent collection.
   Gallery director J. Carter Brown also announced at a National
Press Club luncheon that the gallery had received gifts of three
major 20th century works from the late Rita Schreiber of Los Angeles
in memory of her husband, Taft B. Schreiber, a Republican activist
and MCA Inc. executive who died in 1976.
   The Schreiber gifts include a 1924 painting titled ``Harlequin
Musician'' by Pablo Picasso, ``Woman Seated in an Armchair'' painted
by Henri Matisse in 1940 and a 1927 bronze sculpture by Constantin
Brancusi titled ``Bird in Space.''
   Brown said ``Roses'' would be displayed as part of a three-month
exhibit devoted to anniversary gifts of art beginning March 17,
1991, the 50th anniversary of the opening of the gallery's West
Building.
   ``Our hope is that it will set an example for other patriotic
donors,'' he said.
   The gallery will receive complete title to the painting when Mrs.
Harriman dies.
   Mrs. Harriman said her husband, a former Democratic governor of
New York and heir to a railroad fortune, bought the van Gogh in
Paris in 1930 with his mother.
   A similar van Gogh still life, ``Irises,'' was sold at auction
for a record-breaking $53.9 million in November 1987.
   Another van Gogh, ``Sunflowers,'' sold in London in March 1987
for $39.9 million, making it the third costliest painting on record
after a Picasso self-portrait, ``Yo Picasso,'' which Sotheby's
auctioned May 9 for $47.8 million.
   ``Roses,'' measuring 28 inches by 35.5 inches, was one of four
still lifes van Gogh completed shortly before he left Saint-Remy,
France, in 1890, the year he died.
   Charles S. Moffett, senior curator of paintings at the National
Gallery and a van Gogh authority, said ``Roses'' was
``unquestionably one of van Gogh's most important and most beautiful
paintings.''
   Harriman, a former industrialist, banker, roving U.S. ambassador
and presidential adviser, died in 1986 at age 94. Ambassador to
London and Moscow during World War II, Harriman negotiated the 1963
nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union and was a leader of
the American delegation at the Paris peace talks that ended the
Vietnam War.
   In 1972, the W. Averell Harriman Foundation gave the National
Gallery 22 paintings by such artists as Cezanne, Degas, Gaugin,
Matisse, Picasso and Seurat.

<HEAD>Airlines Say Boeing Groundings Haven't Disrupted Schedules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British airlines, whose Boeing 737-400s were
grounded for engine tests, said Tuesday they have managed to keep to
schedule.
   British Midland Airways and DanAir, the largest airlines
operating the plane, said they were using spare aircraft or
borrowing replacements from other airlines. Each has two 737-400s.
   Eight more 737-400s are operated by Novair, Air Europe and Air
UK-Leisure, which also reported no difficulties meeting schedules.
   DanAir spokesman Peter Clegg said the airlines were hoping for
word Wednesday on the outcome of inspections by SNECMA of France,
the company that manufactures the CFM56-3C engines jointly with
General Electric of the United States.
   The 12 planes were grounded by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority
eight days ago after two incidents in which Boeing 737-400s were
forced to make emergency landings because engine fan blades broke.
   One was a British Midland plane and the other a DanAir plane.
Their engines were shipped to SNECMA's plant for inspection. The
other aircraft are being checked by their companies in Britain.
   Boeing and CFM International, the SNECMA-General Electric
partnership, recommended a week ago that airlines operating planes
with such engines ground the aircraft until the engines can be
replaced or adjusted to operate at lower thrust levels.
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued a similar order the
next day for U.S. airlines. The only U.S. planes affected were five
operated by USAir, and these have received new engines.

<HEAD>U.S. Rejects Nicaraguan Offer for Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Tuesday rejected a
Nicaraguan offer to hold talks on improving relations, saying that
there can be no accommodation unless certain conditions are met
including free and fair elections.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said Monday he had asked
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo to go to Washington with the
government's proposal for opening talks on normalizing relations.
   There have been no substantive talks between officials of the two
countries in more than four years.
   State Department press officer Rudi Boone said an improvement in
relations depends on holding free and fair elections under
international supervision, the beginning of a genuine dialogue with
the Nicaraguan opposition and ``an end to Nicaraguan support for
subversion in the region.''
   The Bush administration has accused the Sandinista government of
increasing its support for leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   The administration also has been exerting heavy diplomatic and
economic pressure on Nicaragua to ensure that opposition parties are
able to compete fairly in national elections set for next February.
   Boone said Nicaragua's professed intention of improving relations
contrasts sharply with several recent actions by the Sandinista
government, including the expulsion of two U.S. diplomats.
   The envoys were accused of fomenting labor unrest but the State
Department has insisted they engaged in no wrongdoing.
   After his meeting Monday with Obando y Bravo, Ortega told
reporters, he had asked the prelate to ``mediate with President Bush
so that a fluid dialogue can develop. We are willing to develop a
dialogue with the North American government so foundations can be
laid for normalizing relations between Nicaragua and the United
States.''
   Although the United States no longer provides military aid to the
Nicaraguan resistance, a U.S. trade embargo imposed five years ago
remains in effect and has contributed to the country's steep
economic decline.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators on Tuesday
resolved a key difference in bills to remove all federal price
controls on natural gas by Jan. 1, 1993.
   The compromise bill is expected to be signed by President Bush
within a few weeks. It is not expected to have a noticeable effect
on retail prices for natural gas because most gas under controls
already is selling below the official ceilings.
   The energy industry supports decontrol, while some consumer
groups oppose it. Some other consumer groups, however, have taken
what amounts to a neutral position.
   The only difference between the original House and Senate bills
was in treatment of natural gas from newly drilled wells. The Senate
version had no provision for early deregulation of gas from such
wells, whereas the House wanted to lift price controls on them
retroactive to March 23, 1989.
   In a compromise, the negotiators agreed that gas from wells
drilled after the date of enactment of the legislation would be
deregulated on May 15, 1991. All other gas not already decontrolled
would be freed from the federal ceilings upon the renegotiation of
sales contracts, or Jan. 1, 1993, whichever comes first.
   About two-thirds of the nation's natural gas was deregulated by
the 1978 Natural Gas Policy Act.
   Natural gas accounts for about one-quarter of the nation's energy
use.
   The Bush administration strongly supports complete decontrol,
contending that it will stimulate more exploration for a fuel source
needed to limit dependence on foreign oil.
   The House passed its original bill in April, while the Senate
bill was passed earlier this month. The compromise bill must be
voted on by both houses again before it is sent to the White House.

<HEAD>Younger Brother Can't Use Name as Trademark on Cheese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE BIGHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ernest and Julio Gallo, owners of the
world's largest winery, won the right Tuesday to keep the younger
brother they raised from using his own name as a trademark for his
own cheese.
   A federal judge concluded that use of the name Joseph Gallo on
retail cheese is misleading because many consumers assume the brand
is connected with E &amp; J Gallo winery. Joseph Gallo sells about
10,000 tons of grapes a year from his vineyards to his brothers but
has no other connection with their winery, based at Modesto, 90
miles southeast of San Francisco.
   ``There is substantial evidence of actual confusion,'' U.S.
District Judge Robert E. Coyle wrote, citing retailers who asked if
the cheese and wine were connected.
   However, the judge's permanent injunction permits Joseph Gallo to
use his name as a signature or in block letters below the words
designating the variety of cheese if the label also includes a
prominent trademark above that does not include the word Gallo.
   Joseph Gallo's attorney, Denis Rice of San Francisco, said he
expects to win on appeal. He criticized Coyle for appearing to use
arguments by winery attorneys verbatim in his brief and failing to
submit a decision separate from the findings and injunction.
   Rice said the findings failed to deal adequately with the
question of whether ``a person is entitled to use his own full name
on his own product.''
   However, Coyle's findings addressed the dilemma of using a common
name that also is a well-known brand.
   ``If every person named Gallo were entitled to use Gallo as a
consumer trademark, Gallo might be adopted as a trademark on any
imaginable product,'' Coyle wrote. ``Such proliferation of uses
would destroy the unique nature of the Gallo brand, its
distinctiveness and its commercial value.''
   A month-long trial last fall offered rare glimpses of the
family-owned winery's development from a provider of bulk wines
without a brand during the Depression to fame and fortune for its
cheap wines _ first Thunderbird in the 1950s, later the Gallo brand
itself. Gallo Winery's sales now total $1 billion a year.
   A Gallo attorney said during an opening statement that in 1933 _
six weeks after their father killed ther mother, then committed
suicide _ Ernest and Julio Gallo began making wine with knowledge
gained from a book they got at the public library. Julio, now 79,
has handled the winemaking ever since while Ernest, 80, became a
widely recognized marketing expert.
   Even though they raised younger brother Joseph, now 67, after the
deaths of their parents, the winery Gallos sued him after he began
using his name on cheese in the mid 1980s.
   Winery attorney Oliver Wanger said Tuesday that Ernest and Julio
had to protect their trademark and a licensing agreement that let
Gallo Salami Co. use the Gallo name on cheese under an agreement by
which winery inspectors checked that brand's quality. Gallo Salami
Co. has no other connection to the three Gallo brothers.
   Wanger said Ernest and Julio were reluctant to sue their brother
but were rebuffed when they offered to license him to use the Gallo
trademark if the winery were allowed reasonable quality control over
his cheese.
   Coyle also commented on the issue of quality control, saying the
winery and Gallo Salami ``have reasonable grounds to be concerned
that sale of cheeses by defendants under the Joseph Gallo brand
creates an undue and unnecessary risk of a serious health problem
resulting from the sale of Joseph Gallo-brand cheese that may injure
the Gallo brand.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush offered to drop a U.S.-proposed
ban on mobile nuclear missiles Tuesday if Congress goes along with
his plan to build both the Midgetman and MX mobile missiles.
   Intensifying his drive for upgrading U.S. strategic forces, Bush
told congressional leaders ``don't pull the rug out from under us''
on the two-missile plan, according to presidential press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush's willingness to abandon the mobile-missile ban at the
negotiating table in Geneva could enhance chances for congressional
passage of his missile-building package, claimed Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga.
   Nunn, who had criticized Bush for failing to make a strong-enough
case for his two-missile program, said he came away from a White
House meeting ``very encouraged'' about the future of both missiles.
   Bush's comments, relayed by participants at the meeting as well
as by Fitzwater, signal a key modification of position for the White
House in strategic arms reduction talks, known as START, that
resumed on Monday in Geneva after a seven-month hiatus.
   ``We would be prepared to adjust our position on the ban
accordingly'' if Congress gives the go-ahead to both the MX and
Midgetman proposals, Fitzwater said.
   However, he said in the absence of such congressional approval,
the U.S. position favoring a ban on mobile long-range nuclear
weapons would remain on the table.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., complained
to Secretary of State James A. Baker III about the emphasis the Bush
administration was giving to the issue of verification.
   U.S. negotiators in Geneva are under instruction to try to work
out some arrangements to insure compliance with an eventual treaty.
   Biden told Baker the administration ``is risking a major blunder
with no potential gain.'' The senator said concentrating on
anti-cheating safeguards could divert attention from such major
issues as reducing weapons arsenals.
   The result, Biden said, could be indefinitely postponing
completion of an accord.
   Baker assured Biden there was no ``ulterior motive'' in trying to
pin down verification measures. In fact, he said, one purpose was to
accelerate Senate ratification of the treaty by discussing
enforcement with the Soviets in advance.
   The proposal to ban all mobile nuclear missile systems was made
by the Reagan administration and embraced until Tuesday by the Bush
administration. It would apply to both the 10-warhead MX missile and
the one-warhead Midgetman _ as well as to their Soviet counterparts,
including the multiple-warhead SS-24s.
   However, the administration found itself in the position of
advocating such a ban in Geneva while arguing on Capitol Hill for
more mobile-missile deployment.
   Bush in April proposed spending $1.2 billon next year to begin
placing 50 existing MX missiles on rail cars; and another $100
million as a first installment on a $25 billion program to build the
truck-based Midgetman by 1997.
   However, the plan has run into considerable opposition in
Congress _ both among those who contend the twin-missile program is
too expensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other.
   Fitzwater said: ``We think a mobile capability is essential. Then
you negotiate reductions as best you can.''
   He said that moving ahead on both the MX and Midgetman missiles
would give the United States more leverage at the Geneva talks.
   He compared pressing ahead with the two mobile missile systems _
against the backdrop of the talks to reduce strategic weapons _ with
the U.S. decision to go ahead with deployment of intermediate-range
cruise missiles during negotiations that led to the 1987 U.S.-Soviet
treaty to ban such weapons.
   ``If Congress does pass those (MX and Midgetman), then they would
become part of our negotiations (in Geneva),'' Fitzwater said.
   Nunn said he was satisfied by the outcome of the White House
session.
   ``I think it's very clear that the president, the secretary of
state and the secretary of defense were willing and indeed indicated
they would re-examine the Geneva position on banning mobile missiles
if Congress approves both the MX rail-mobile and the Midgetman
funding,'' he said.
   ``They made it clear, however, that they were not going to end up
in a position permiting mobile missiles if Congress was not going to
fund mobile missiles,'' Nunn added.
   Nunn also said he strongly supported the administration's
proposal that efforts to reach agreement on verification procedures
be nailed down between U.S. and Soviet negotiators at the outset of
talks on controlling long-range missiles.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., senior Republican on the Armed Services
Committee, lauded the president's position.
   Warner said Bush ``clearly told us that if the Congress can get
its act together and support the president on both programs, then
the question of mobility would be revisited by the administration.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters ``it
remains to be seen'' whether Bush's strong pitch for his two-missile
plan would help it overcome opposition in Congress.

   Military President Augusto Pinochet
Tuesday said he will not run for re-election in December.
   ``I'm a bad candidate at this time, because, should I run, I
would be seen as acting out of ambition, and I'm not ambitious,''
Gen. Pinochet said.
   Last week Pinochet appeared to be toying with the idea of
running, saying he would run ``if the people ask for it.''
   On Tuesday, he said flatly: ``I will not run in the December
election.''
   Pinochet, 73, has ruled since September 1973, when he led the
bloody coup that toppled an elected leftist government. He was
obliged to call the December election after a referendum in October
last year in which voters rejected a proposal to extend his term
until 1997.
   He is to hand over power on March 11 to the winner of a Dec. 14
election. But he said he will retain his command of the country's
powerful army.
   The constitution prohibits re-election of a president, but
conservative groups have insisted that Pinochet can run. They
contend that the rule does not apply to Pinochet because he was
never election.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday told the 141
teenagers who are this year's Presidential Scholars they are doubly
bound to answer his call to community service.
   Calling them ``some of the best and brightest students in
American education,'' Bush said, ``While already you've done much, I
know you will do more _ and not for yourselves alone, but for nation
and neighbor.''
   Bush was joined by his wife Barbara and Secretary of Education
Lauro Cavazos for the ceremony held under threatening skies on the
South Lawn of the White House.
   Bush, who is staging another White House event on Wednesday to
launch his youth service initiative and will follow up with a speech
in New York on Thursday, said, ``An educated person also has duties
and responsibilities.''
   ``The definition of a successful life must include serving
others. That goes double for America's best,'' he told the
Presidential Scholars, who hail from all 50 states, the District of
Columbia, U.S. territories and even from American families living
abroad.
   They were chosen by a commission _ 121 for academic achievements,
leadership, character and ideals, and 20 for artistic
accomplishments.
   Each Presidential Scholar got to bring his or her most
influential teacher to Washington to share in the accolades, a
five-day whirlwind of seminars, speeches, dinners and festivities
that concludes Wednesday.
   ``Many have labored to share their knowledge with you and you can
give them no greater gift than to share your knowledge with
others,'' Bush said.
   Bush noted that one of the scholars, Clarity Haynes of Duke
Ellington School of the Arts in Washington, D.C., speaks both
Portuguese and Spanish.
   ``I'm a little jealous. Some say I'm not even fluent in
English,'' Bush joked.
   He quoted the poet James Lowell's words, ``If youth be a defect,
it is one we outgrow only too soon.''
   ``I hope you'll accept some counsel from one who's a little long
in the tooth, maybe. But if youth is a defect, treasure it as many
years as you can,'' said Bush.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican appointed lay businessman and
bankers to manage its scandal-tainted bank Tuesday, ending the
20-year presidency of American Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus.
   ``In principle, laymen should be more competent in financial
affairs than clerics,'' said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   He identified an American businessman and bankers from Italy,
Spain, Switzerland and West Germany who were named to the bank's
supervisory board. They will appoint a lay director and deputy
director.
   Police said another banker wanted in connection with Italy's
worst postwar banking scandal flew to Milan from Brazil on Tuesday
and surrendered to authorities.
   Banker Umberto Ortolani faces charges of fraudulent bankruptcy
following the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.
   Judges investigating the collapse of Italy's largest private bank
have charged Ortolani with stealing $230 million from the
Milan-based bank.
   Marcinkus and two lay Vatican bank officials were charged with
being accessories to the bankruptcy, and warrants were issued for
their arrests in 1987.
   But the arrests never were carried out. Italy's Constitutional
Court ruled a Vatican-Italian treaty prevents Italian authorities
from interfering in affairs of the Vatican, the city that is an
independent state.
   Vatican officials denied wrongdoing in the collapse of Banco
Ambrosiano but agreed to pay $250 million to its creditors.
   New board members of the Vatican bank are Angelo Caloia, chairman
of Italy's Mediocredito Lombardo; Philippe de Weck, former chairman
of Union Bank of Switzerland; Jose A. Sanchez Asiain, co-chairman of
Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya; Theodor E. Pietzcker, a director of
West Germany's Deutsche Bank; and Thomas M. Macioce, former chairman
and chief executive officer of Allied Stores Corp. in New York.
   The nominations take effect immediately, Navarro said.
   Tuesday's appointments are the latest in sweeping management
reforms announced in March that also established a special
commission of five cardinals for the bank, which is called the
Institute for Religious Works.
   The reforms abolished the post of president, held since 1969 by
the 67-year-old Marcinkus, a native of Cicero, Ill. However,
Marcinkus retains another post equivalent to deputy governor of the
Vatican state.
   Navarro said the new board members have helped the church in the
past. He said Macioce has advised New York Archbishop John J.
O'Connor on financial matters.
   The Vatican bank's balance sheet is secret, but Navarro said the
board could decide to make it public.
   Board members have broad responsibility to decide long-term
investment strategy and give guidelines to the director, who has
charge of daily management.

   Trucks hauling food could not carry garbage
under a bill introduced in the House by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., to
head off what he said was a growing health hazard.
   ``Drivers who are bringing meat, produce and grain products from
the Midwest to the East Coast are often returning with bales of
solid waste to be disposed of in landfills,'' Smith said.
   Smith's bill would require the Department of Transportation to
adopt regulations prohibiting any vehicle that carries solid waste
or hazardous waste from being used to transport food.
   Violators would be punished with criminal penalties of up to
$350,000 and five years in jail.
   In a one-minute address to the House on Monday, Smith said that
the practice of carrying both food and garbage appears to be
increasing as landfills in eastern states reach capacity.
   New Jersey produces about 15,000 tons, or 750 truckloads, of
solid waste daily to be sent to landfills in western Pennsylvania
and Ohio, Smith said.
   ``Although these trucks must be licensed by New Jersey to haul
garbage within or out of state, there are no requirements which
prevent these same trucks from returning with a cargo of food,''
Smith said.

   Also approved by the committee were the nominations of James R.
Thompson of Alabama as deputy NASA administrator, Thomas Joseph
Murrin of Pennsylvania as deputy commerce secretary, Susan Carol
Schwab of Maryland as assistant commerce secretary, and Jeffrey Neil
Shane and Kate Leader Moore, both of the District of Columbia, to be
assistant transportation secretaries.

<HEAD>With AM-Aerodyne Indictments</HEAD>

   The Armed Services have yet to detect any
safety problems because of the alleged illegal substitution of scrap
metal for designated alloys in engines for 5,000 military aircraft,
the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   According to a fraud indictment Monday in Tampa, Fla., of three
former executives of Aerodyne Investment Casings Inc., the company
used scrap in making turbine blades of the type used in 22,000 jet
aircraft, helicopters and tanks.
   ``Now, it's estimated that 5,000 aircraft have been equipped with
these parts since 1982,'' said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
``Two million hours have been accrued on the aircraft without any
known related incidents.
   ``There has been no noticeable degradation in performance using
that 50-percent mixture.''
   The blades were used in T-53 engine that's used on the Huey,
Cobra and Mohawk helicopters for the Army, he said.
   The Army suspended the contractor last Aug. 16 ``because of the
evidence of Aerodyne's use of nonspecified alloys in making parts''
said Brown.
   The grand jury indicted three former Aerodyne executives, Russell
K. Baker Sr. and Russell K. Baker Jr., and Carman Eugene Alexander.
   Williams said the alleged fraud was discovered by the Defense
Department's inspector general, who notified the military services
and the Defense Logistics Agency.
   Since then ``a new source has been since required to produce the
parts,'' said Williams.
   It was not immediately clear what steps the services had taken to
cope with the alleged substitution.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Approves Measure to Deal with Oil Spills</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Oil Spill Plan, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee approved a bill Tuesday
designed to deal with oil spills and try to prevent them through
such steps as random alcohol testing of crews and improved radar
systems for tracking tankers.
   The Oil Tanker Navigation Safety Act of 1989 deals directly with
Alaska's Prince William Sound, where Exxon continues cleaning up a
massive spill, and would also affect tanker operations elsewhere.
   Meanwhile, Transporation Secretary Samuel Skinner announced a
comprehensive inspection of the 800-mile Alaska pipeline. He
indicated that the March 24 rupture of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker
prompted the inspection, originally set for 1991.
   ``The Exxon Valdez oil spill has taught us a valuable lesson: the
need to avoid complacency when it comes to protecting our
environment,'' Skinner said.
   He said the inspection will review operating pressures, repair
procedures, protective coating requirements, routine inspection
schedules and the electric current used to retard corrosion, along
with oil spill contingency plans for the pipeline.
   Skinner also sent Congress a proposed bill to give the Coast
Guard broader authority over mariners, including revocation of their
certification if they have a record of drunken driving.
   That and several other provisions already were in the bill
approved without opposition by the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee.
   The bill, backed by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, would open
highway driving records of merchant mariners to the Coast Guard,
provide for random and other alcohol testing of people in
safety-senstive jobs on tankers and improve radar systems to aid the
tracking of ships through potentially hazardous areas.
   It also requires the secretary of transportation to examine
several other safety steps and sets guidelines for oil spill
contingency plans, including requiring some oil spill cleanup
equipment to be prepositioned at strategic locations and other
equipment to be carried aboard tankers.
   The legislation, consolidating six proposed bills arising from
three Senate hearings on the Alaska spill, was sent to the full
Senate as the oil industry unveiled its own plan for responding to
major spills.
   The industry announced it would spend $250 million to set up a
network of response teams capable of handling an accident as large
as the March 24 disaster involving the Exxon Valdez.
   The Senate bill would require at least three persons to be on the
bridge of a tanker in certain waters, including the sound. The Exxon
Valdez's captain had gone below deck and turned the helm over to his
third mate, who was not licensed to navigate the sound. The captain,
Joseph Hazelwood, faces several charges in connection with the
incident.
   The Senate measure would allow suspension of a merchant marine's
license, following a hearing, for being drunk on the job or if there
is a record of a highway driver's license being suspended or revoked
within the previous five years for alcohol or drug use.
   The legislation instructs the transportation secretary to examine
whether newly constructed tankers should be built with double hulls
or double bottoms and also to conduct a study of whether the size of
tankers being built is a factor in oil spills. The Exxon Valdez
carried over 50 million gallons.
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said he would propose on the Senate
floor an amendment that would impose financial punishment on
companies responsible for oil spills, including a possible giving up
of all profits for one year if in a case of ``gross or willful
negligence.'' The money would go into an environmental fund.

   President Bush's committee to enhance U.S.
trade competitiveness began work Tuesday as Vice President Dan
Quayle promised to shore up U.S. interests against the consolidation
of European markets.
   Quayle, chairman of the Council on Competitiveness, said the
European Community's plan to restructure its economies into a single
European market by 1992 has caused concern among U.S. businesses.
   ``I share some of those concerns, but fundamentally EC-92 is both
a challenge and an opportunity for the United States,'' he said in a
speech to the National Foreign Trade Council, the National
Association of Manufacturers and the Coalition For Employment
Through Exports.
   The Council on Competitiveness, Quayle said, will review federal
laws to ensure they don't unfairly restrict U.S. companies against
European competitors.
   The vice president said the council also would ensure United
States access to and fair competition in the single European market,
and would re-evaluate policies on deregulation of financial
institutions and anti-trust restrictions.
   American companies complain that antitrust measures prevent them
from competing fairly because European countries are not restrained
by the same standards.
   Many of the antitrust policies are ``anachronistic in this age of
global competition,'' Quayle said, adding that merger law reform is
needed.
   ``We need to consider reducing present incentives for price
antitrust litigation,'' he said.
   The vice president said the area of biotechnology, in which the
United States has been a leader, will be reviewed.
   ``The key to our success in marketing new biotechnology products
has been a sensible regulatory regime that applies basic
competitiveness principles,'' he said, but cautioned against
unnecessary regulatory burdens on product development.
   ``We need to consider ways to improve incentives for private
sector investment,'' Quayle said, citing Bush's proposal to reduce
the capital gains tax, make permanent tax credit payments for
research and development and ease the patent applications process.
   The Council on Competitiveness, whose members include cabinet
members involved with trade issues, was set up by Bush to continue
the work of President Reagan's task force. Reagan's task force dealt
with eliminating excessive government regulation.

<HEAD>Government to Pay for Development Stage of Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, in a policy shift from
the Reagan era, has decided that the government will pay the full
cost of readying new weapons for production, Pentagon officials said
Tuesday.
   For the past eight years, government and defense contractors have
split the development cost of most weapons systems. That policy will
change, the new No. 2 Pentagon official, Deputy Defense Secretary
Donald J. Atwood, revealed in a published interview.
   Atwood's proposal was embodied in a Pentagon management review
that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney approved and sent to the White
House on Tuesday, acording to other Pentagon officials. The policy
change does not require congressional review.
   ``We're just going to implement it,'' said Atwood.
   The old system does not encourage defense contractors to develop
the most efficient weapons and means of producing them, Atwood said.
``It encourages them to skimp,'' he said in an interview with The
Washington Post.
   Pentagon officials distributed the text on Tuesday.
   ``The consequence is, lo and behold, we end up in production with
something that's difficult to build. We didn't put the time and
effort into it,'' said Atwood, a former executive at General Motors
Corp.
   He did not offer any specific examples, but the Pentagon has had
trouble in recent years in the performance of several costly weapons.
   The development contract, said Atwood, ``is when you should put
your effort into designing it for simplicity and producibility, of
designing it for reliability and performance and quality. And it is
not the time you skimp. That is the whole purpose.''
   The shift, which is likely to be hailed by the defense industry,
will not affect existing contracts on major weapons systems, such as
the B-2 ``stealth'' bomber or a new class of attack submarines.
   But Pentagon officials said in a statement that future contracts
for full-scale development of the Air Force's new Advanced
Technology Fighter ``may reflect the change in contract policy.''
   In outlining the new policy, Atwood distinguished between
research that contractors pursue on various weapons-related
technologies and the money they spend developing actual weapons for
the government.
   ``I think the government should pay the bill for the development
phase,'' he said. ``By the development, I mean the early-on
demonstration, validation phase, and for the full-scale
development.''
   ``Now, I don't want to hold out any bonanza to any industry that
thinks, `Well, we'll get all the money we want. Quite the
contrary,'' he said.

   President Bush announced Tuesday he will retain
Frank G. Wisner as ambassador to Egypt and will name Susan M.
Coughlin to the National Transportation Safety Board.
   In addition, the White House said two top Pentagon officials will
retain their posts, and Bush will name Wade F. Horn as chief of the
children's bureau in the Health and Human Services Department and S.
Anthony McCann to a new post in Veteran's Affairs.
   In the Pentagon appointments, Bush announced his intention to
retain Robert W. Page Sr. as assistant secretary of Army in charge
of civil works, and Stephen M. Duncan as assistant secretary of
Defense in charge of reserve affairs.
   In other appointments, Bush announced he will name McCann as
assistant Veteran's Affairs secretary for finance and planning.
McCann since 1986 has been assistant secretary of management and
budget at HHS.
   Wisner has been ambassador to Egypt since 1986, and was
previously senior deputy assistant secretary of state for African
affairs and ambassador to Zambia. He served in a variety of State
Department posts prior to his posting in Zambia in 1979.
   Ms. Coughlin has been deputy administrator of the Federal
Railroad Administation at the Transportation Department since 1987,
and previously was acting vice president and deputy vice president
of the Export-Import Bank. Earlier, she was an officer for
intergovernmental relations at the Transportation Department from
1981 to 1983.
   Horn since 1986 has been director of outpatient psychological
services at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Washington, and
previously was a professor and administrator at George Washington
University School of Medicine and Michigan State University.
   Bush also said he will retain Henry E. Hockeimer as associate
director of the U.S. Information Agency. Hockeimer has served in
that job since 1988 and before that was assistant director of the
U.S. Information Agency.

<TEXT>
   The new U.S. envoy to Afghan rebels said
Tuesday he plans to meet with their leaders to stress continued U.S.
support as they ``conclude successfully the final phase of their
struggle'' against the Kabul regime.
   Peter Thomsen, a career diplomat, commented after taking the oath
of office for the newly created position.
   He acknowledged it was unusual for a U.S. diplomat to be
accredited to a rebel movement, and said creation of the post was an
``unusually strong way'' to convey continuing support for the rebels.
   Thomsen said he plans to leave shortly for the rebel headquarters
in Pakistan to meet with the leaders and to establish a dialogue
with the interim government the insurgents have set up.
   ``In these and many other future meetings with the resistance, my
objective will be to deepen further our relations with them and to
ensure continued American support for their cause as they conclude
successfully the final phase of their struggle,'' he said.
   Thomsen, who has concentrated on Asian affairs during most of his
career, said U.S. objectives in Afghanistan remain unchanged,
providing for ``a political settlement that will include genuine
self-determination for the Afghan people, the return of the refugees
in safety and dignity, and the restoration of Afghanistan's
sovereignty and independence.''
   He said the Marxist government in Kabul ``has been thoroughly
discredited'' by its role over the past decade.

   The Energy Department confirmed Tuesday it will
make a closer study of environmental risks posed by a prototype
plutonium refinery, a move that a House panel chairman says will
delay start of plant construction at least two years.
   The department has called the plant a key to modernization of the
nation's nuclear weapons production complex. It would use a new
laser technology to convert existing military stockpiles of
fuel-grade plutonium to weapon-grade material.
   Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., chairman of a special Armed Services
Committee panel, said Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had made the
decision in response to an environmental group's threat last April
to sue to force such a study.
   Will Callicott, a department spokesman, said Watkins had notified
selected members of Congress of his decison on Monday and Tuesday,
although no general announcement was made.
   The move was made, Callicott said, because of ``our own wish to
put any public doubt to rest ... as to the environmental safeguards
for the project.'' He declined to say how long the environmental
study would delay the refinery project.
   Spratt said Watkins had committed the department to conducting a
formal Environmental Impact Statement on the prototype, which is
being built at the department's Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory near San Francisco.
   The Livermore project is a prototype for a permanent plutonium
refinery, called the Special Isotope Separation plant, that the
department wants to build at the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory, near Idaho Falls.
   An environmental study of the Idaho site already has been
completed.
   Spratt's panel, which is reviewing Energy Department plans for
modernizing the nuclear weapons complex and cleaning up its
hazardous wastes, last week voted to recommend withholding funds for
beginning construction at Idaho Falls in 1990.
   In a statement announcing Watkins' decision, Spratt said he was
pleased by the move.
   ``It signifies to the people of Livermore and vicinity that their
concerns for health and safety are shared by the Department of
Energy, and more broadly, it is a tangible sign of what Secretary
Watkins calls a `change of culture' at DOE,'' he said.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, which notified the
department last April that it would sue if an environmental
assessment were not performed, said it was pleased by the decision.
   ``We scored a victory,'' said Dan Reicher of the council. ``It's
a combination of the strong position we believe we have, plus
congressional pressure.''
   Spratt said it would take at least 12 months to finish the
environmental study, and that the start of construction at Idaho
Falls is likely to be delayed at least two years.

<HEAD>Report Says Star Wars Research Less Costly Than Bush Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States can conduct Star Wars
research and development far more cheaply than the Bush
administration is proposing, acording to a congressional report
released Tuesday.
   The three types of budget options described in the Congressional
Budget Office report would cost $11.3 billion to $18.4 billion from
1990 to 1994, rather than the $31.1 billion proposed by President
Bush for the same period.
   ``If we spend billions on strategic defense that does not really
defend us _ and siphon these billions from the budgets of fighter
planes, ships, tanks and personnel _ we may not make the country
more secure,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., a member of the House
Armed Services Committee who requested the report. ``For this
reason, the CBO report bears careful study.''
   Bush cut spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative to $4.6
billion for fiscal 1990, down from the $5.9 billion proposed by
former President Reagan.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has also said Bush will shift the
focus of Star Wars from deployment sometime in the 1990s to research
on a more advanced system known as ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' consisting
of thousands of orbiting satellites.
   Under the report's first option, the United States would be
protected against a Soviet breakthrough in technology or the
Kremlin's deployment of a strategic defense system.
   Total spending would range from $11.3 billion to $14.5 billion
and the option would be in compliance with the Anti-ballistic
Missile Treaty, the report said.
   The second option, estimated at a cost of about $17 billion,
would enable the United States to defend parts of the country
against a limited nuclear attack caused by an accident. That option
may comply with the ABM Treaty, the report said.
   The third option, costing about $18.4 billion, would provide a
larger strategic defense system that would protect land-based
missiles housed in silos such as the MX and Midgetman.
   The report estimates did not include the cost of procuring the
system.

   A federal judge Tuesday postponed the
sentencing of Oliver L. North to consider allegations that one of
the jurors who convicted the former presidential aide lied during
jury selection.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell set a hearing for June 28
on defense allegations that juror Tara King had used drugs before
the trial and had failed during jury selection to disclose that
three of her brothers had arrest records.
   If the defense proves that it learned after the verdict that King
deliberately withheld the information about her brothers during jury
selection, the judge might be forced to grant a mistrial.
   Gesell released defense pleadings about the allegation that had
been filed under court seal.
   They contained copies of District of Columbia Superior Court
records indicating that one of Ms. King's brothers, Samuel A. King
Jr., had an arrest record, including a 1987 conviction for armed
robbery.
   Two other brothers were arrested on other charges but the cases
were dismissed.
   A sister was involved in a child-custody suit with her estranged
husband, according to court records produced by the defense.
   Before the trial, Ms. King indicated on a questionnaire for
prospective jurors that no member of her family had ever been
involved in a criminal or civil case, either as a witness or as the
subject of an investigation.
   ``This apparently intentional misstatement raises serious
questions as to juror bias and impartiality, and suggests that
defendant was deprived of his right to exercise peremptory and
causal challenges in an informed manner,'' North's lawyers said.
   In another pleading unsealed by Gesell, North's lawyers said
``the possibility that a juror might have been under the influence
of narcotics during trial calls into question the fairness of the
proceeding and warrants further inquiry.''
   Ms. King told reporters after the verdict that she had used
marijuana and cocaine before the trial but not while she sat on the
jury that convicted North of three felony counts.
   North, a former White House aide, had been scheduled to be
sentenced Friday. He faces a possible 10-year sentence for aiding
and abetting in obstruction of Congress, destroying or mutilating
official documents and accepting an illegal gratuity _ a security
system outside his house _ from arms dealer Richard V. Secord.
   But Gesell postponed sentencing until July 5.
   After receiving the court documents about Ms. Kings' brothers,
the judge granted a motion by North's lawyers to reconsider his
earlier refusal to hold a closed hearing on the defense allegations.
   Gesell directed North's lawyers to file ``a full written
statement indicating the precise time and date when counsel first
learned each fact documented in support of the request for
reconsideration, noting in each instance the name and address of
each and every person supplying the information.''
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh contended in another brief
unsealed Tuesday that North has the burden of showing that his
lawyers obtained the information about Ms. King's family after the
May 4 verdict.
   Walsh noted that media reports during the trial that two other
jurors had given incorrect answers to the same question by failing
to disclose they had been parties to civil suits arising from
traffic accidents.
   North's lawyers did not seek to dismiss either of those jurors
and replace them with alternates.
   Walsh also suggested that King's false statement on the
questionnaire may have been inadvertent because she has 14 brothers
and sisters.
   It was possible that ``any knowledge she did have simply did not
come to mind at the time she completed the jury questionnaire,''
Walsh said. He also pointed out that Ms. King is almost 17 years
younger than the brother convicted of armed robbery.
   ``The involvement of the juror's relatives in prior legal
proceedings,'' Walsh argued, ``gives rise to no inference that she
harbored a bias against North.''
   ``If Ms. King developed any prejudice from such experiences, it
would likely be directed against the prosecution, not defendants,''
he said.
   In a court filing on Monday, Walsh asked Gesell to imprison
North, saying the retired Marine lieutenant colonel had not shown
``one iota of remorse'' and considered himself ``beyond reproach.''
   The prosecutor charged that North had lied on the witness stand,
concocting a false story to help win acquittal of a charge he
pocketed $4,300 in traveler's checks that a Nicaraguan rebel leader
had entrusted in him.
   North, 45, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, was acquitted of
nine charges in all.

   Hundreds of soldiers have failed to halt ethnic
violence in a Central Asian city where weekend rioting killed three
people and injured 53, Soviet reports said Tuesday.
   The official Tass news agency said authorities imposed a 9 p.m.
to 6 a.m. curfew and banned all rallies in Novy Uzen, in the
Kazakhstan republic, but ``clashes between warring groups of
hoodlums are continuing in the town.''
   Hundreds of soldiers were sent to Novy Uzen over the weekend to
quell the fighting in the city that is an isolated gas and oil
refining center in the harsh Caspian desert.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Boris Mikhailov said the rioting
began Friday night in Novy Uzen and was aimed at minorities
originally from the Caucasus Mountain region on the other side of
the Caspian Sea.
   It was the third outbreak of violence in the past six weeks in
Soviet Central Asia. The region has been buffeted by a soaring
population, pollution, a shortage of jobs and rising ethnic tensions.
   About 100 people were killed earlier this month during 10 days of
arson and attacks directed against the Meskhi Turk minority in
neighboring Uzbekistan where Uzbeks form the majority.
   In Turkmenia, a republic south of Kazakhstan, mobs rampaged
through the streets in early May demanding that cooperatives be
closed and Armenian traders be forced to leave the area.
   Official reports said most of the violence in Novy Uzen was
against Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Lezgins who make up about 20,000
of the city's population of 56,000 people, with Kazakhs in the
majority.
   Mikhailov said about 7,000 people gathered Monday in the city's
main square demanding that cooperative businesses be closed and
people from the Caucasus republics be sent home.
   ``Two battalions of Interior (Ministry) soldiers were brought in
to stop the unrest,'' he said. ``The crowd was dispersed, but it
broke into several large groups of youths armed with pipes and
stones and other objects. They went along the streets, organizing
brawls, pogroms and arson.''
   Mikhailov said three people were killed and 53 injured according
to preliminary reports and there were 57 arrests. Tass said said two
Kazakhs and one Lezgin were killed.
   Official reports said the trouble began with a fight between
ethnic groups at a dance. Hundreds of young people roamed the
streets breaking windows and setting fire to cars and buildings.
   Tass reported 59 shops were damaged, five cars burned and many

   It said soldiers fired in the air and used cheremukha, a chemical
substance similar to tear gas, to break up the mobs. The military
has said cheremukha was used when troops crushed a pro-independence
protest in Tbilisi, Georgia, on April 9. Twenty people were killed
in the violence.
   More than 700 people, mostly women and children, were evacuated
from Novy Uzen to a heavily guarded bus station 8{ miles from the
city, Mikhailov said.
   The government newspaper Izvestia reported many returned home
after the situation quieted down.
   It said the native Kazakhs ``complained to the leadership about
bad social conditions of life in the city and high prices for
essential goods.''
   They demanded that people from the Caucasus region be forced to
move and that gas and oil production plants stop bringing in workers
for work shifts of a week or longer, according to Izvesti. It said
the protesters claimed the imported workers live better than the
local population.
   The protesters were particularly angry at cooperatives owned by
the Caucasus minorities, Mikhailov said. Cooperatives are small,
privately owned businesses that have been permitted under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms as an alternative to the state-run
economy.
   Many Soviets suspect cooperative owners of profiteering and
serving as fronts for organized crime.

<HEAD>Pollution News Shocking But Not Surprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOOELE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of this arid county in western
Utah, home to military installations, industrial plants and waste
disposal facilities, are no strangers to pollution hazards.
   And now, state officials have been told that AMAX Magnesium
Corp., which extracts metal from evaporation ponds on the western
shore of the Great Salt Lake, is the nation's single greatest source
of toxic air pollutants, specifically chlorine, according to the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
   ``Certainly we're not proud of the designation,'' AMAX spokesman
Lee Brown said Tuesday. ``But the fact is, we've been cognizant of
the emissions and have done environmental studies that show
absolutely no discernable effects.''
   Brown said the plant, about 65 miles from Salt Lake City and 40
miles from the nearest community, employs about 600 workers who
extract magnesium chloride salt from the briny water and process
magnesium and liquid chloride for a variety of industrial uses.
   Even now, the company is installing devices to reduce the
emission of chlorine gas from the stacks by 50 percent at year's end
and a total of 75 percent by 1991, state environmental health
officials say.
   What concerns some officials more than AMAX's emissions is that
Tooele County, with its immense deserts and desolate mountains, has
become a favorite destination for low-level hazardous wastes from
producers in and out of the state.
   Radioactive tailings from an old uranium mill in Salt Lake County
are buried there. Hazardous waste disposal sites are in operation or
on the drawing boards, one waste incinerator is under construction
and another has been proposed.
   At Dugway Proving Ground, the Army has conducted germ warfare
defense testing for decades, and Tooele Army Depot stores much of
the nation's arsenal of obsolete chemical weapons. The Air Force
uses hundreds of square miles of the county for bombing runs and jet
fighter training.
   ``People drive out there, and they think of all this wasted
land,'' said state Rep. Beverly White, a 10-term Democrat. ``But we
have mountains, streams and deserts. It isn't just nothing. I've
been saying for years that I hope we don't turn into the dumping
ground of the world.''
   Alan Miller of the Utah Environmental Center in Salt Lake City
shares her concerns.
   He praised the strict criteria county officials have established
for siting, mitigation and emergency response capabilities when
approving new hazardous waste and other developments with a
potential for pollution.
   ``But along with expertise in knowing how to handle, manage and
work with a hazardous management zone, comes a feeling of growing
confidence,'' he said. ``Just like with TAD, there's an attitude of,
`We can live with these things.' Is Tooele going to be the
hazardous-waste frontier?''
   However, Tooele County Commissioner Bill Pitt says the potential
perils of hazardous waste and pollution or accidents at Dugway or
Tooele Army Depot must be weighed with the economic benefits to its
30,000 residents.
   Besides, he said, all are strictly regulated by a variety of
local, state and federal agencies.
   ``I'm not trying to downplay the health factors,'' he said. ``But
we are trying to balance the two _ health factors and economics.''

<TEXT>
   An Indian family, needing money to pay
medical bills, has sold a historic buckskin shirt that belonged to
the adopted son of Sitting Bull in a deal that allowed the clothing
to be donated to the state museum.
   The pullover, decorated with beaded strips and patches, was worn
by One Bull in the 1920s, Chris Dill, director of the North Dakota
Historical Society's museum division, said in a statement Tuesday.
   ``One Bull was an important figure in the state's history, having
fought at the Little Bighorn and being a close associate of Sitting
Bull,'' Dill said. ``This is a major gift, a real treasure.''
   Sitting Bull, a Sioux leader, adopted One Bull when the boy was 4
years old, Dill said.
   One Bull, who died in 1948 at the age of 105, was credited with
killing four of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer's soldiers during
the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876, said Dr. John
Hamilton, a Williston dentist who bought the shirt.
   Bridget Jones, currator of collections for the Historical
Society, said the state has pictures of One Bull wearing the
buckskin shirt, which makes it even more valuable as an historical
artifact.
   One Bull's daughter, Margaret One Bull Tremmel, made the shirt
for her father. She recently sold it to Hamilton so he could donate
it and other items to the state, Dill said.
   Hamilton refused to divulge how much he paid Mrs. Tremmel for the
shirt but said it had been appraised at between $10,000 and $15,000.
He paid ``something less'' than the appraised value, he said.
   Mrs. Tremmel, 80, suffers from Parkinson's disease and was placed
in a nursing home in Mobridge, S.D., in April, said her daughter,
Maethus Grey Bear of Fort Yates. The family needs the money for
medical costs and other expenses, Grey Bear said.
   Mrs. Tremmel wanted the shirt to end up in a museum where it
would be safe, Grey Bear said.

<DATELINE>ARIEL, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish settler pumped
submachine gunfire into a crowd of Palestinians waiting for a ride
near Tel Aviv on Tuesday, wounding two people, police said.
   The shooting occurred shortly after angry settlers booed and
shouted down Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, chanting ``Traitor!
Traitor!'' as the Israeli leader tried to eulogize a U.S.-born
settler slain Saturday in the occupied West Bank.
   ``Revenge! Revenge!'' some screamed.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said some ``extremist reactions''
aim at jeopardizing government plans for elections in the occupied
territories.
   ``I think some right-wing extremists in Israel are horrified by
the peace plan,'' Rabin said on Israel Television. ``They still
believe we can restore the status quo through the use of military
force only.''
   Israel's military intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak,
said the Palestine Liberation Organization may accept the election
proposal because its ranks are split and there is more open
criticism of chairman Yasser Arafat. He also said international
support for the uprising has declined.
   Police said they arrested three Palestinians in the stabbing
death of settler Frederick Steven Rosenfeld, 48. Israel radio
reported the army blew up the suspects' homes Tuesday.
   After Rosenfeld's funeral, a 23-year-old settler approached
Palestinians at a highway intersection and opened fire with an Uzi
submachine gun, said police spokeswoman Dalia Gilad.
   He wounded two Palestinians, one seriously, she said.
   The gunman fled on foot, but was captured by police, Ms. Gilad
said, refusing to name the settler.
   One witness told Israel army radio the man wore a checkered Arab
headdress when he approached the intersection and fired, then pulled
off the headdress and shouted ``I'm a Jew!'' before running away.
   Israel radio quoted police officials as saying the gunman wore a
Jewish skullcap.
   Tel Aviv police refused to comment, saying there was ``a news
blackout.''
   Itim national news agency said the attacker was returning from
Rosenfeld's funeral, which took place 18 miles east of the shooting
site where Palestinians from the occupied territories wait for
transport home.
   The funeral began with a procession from Ariel settlement, where
Rosenfeld lived. It drew 500 settlers, most armed.
   Shamir told the crowd, ``The people of Israel are standing with
you today.''
   But most of his eulogy was drowned by shouts of ``Liar!'' and
``Shamir go home!''
   Settlers are demanding harsher measures to quell the 18-month
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and
blame Shamir for Arab attacks on settlers.
   At least 526 Palestinians and 23 Israelis have been killed since
the revolt against Israeli occupation began in December 1987.
   Shamir's hard-line rival in the right-wing Likud bloc, Industry
Minister Ariel Sharon, was not interrupted when he recited the
Kaddish, or prayer for the dead, for Rosenfeld.
   Sharon opposes Shamir's initiative to hold elections in the
occupied lands. Fistfights erupted after the funeral, when furious
settlers attacked a left-wing activist who attended the service.
Soldiers who pulled the activist to safety also were struck.
   Three stone-throwing attacks on Arabs were reported, Israel radio
and Arab reports said. Two Arabs were slightly injured and a third
was in moderate condition in the hospital with injuries from rocks
and flying glass.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the West Bank army commander, told Israel
radio the Palestinian suspects encountered Rosenfeld hiking alone
near Arab villages outside Ariel.
   He said the Palestinians told interrogators that Rosenfeld
chatted with them, took their pictures with his camera and asked
them to photograph him. One of the Palestinians then grabbed
Rosenfeld's knife and stabbed him in the back, Mitzna said. There
was no motive, he said.
   The army identified those arrested as Fahim Ramadan Sirhan
Ibrahim, 21, Bilan Ibrahim Mustafa Samrah, 22, and Mustafa Otman
Amar Elhaj, 21, all from Burkin village near Ariel.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Tax Penalty Revisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee approved
legislation Tuesday revising and simplifying most of the nearly 150
federal tax penalties.
   The measure generally would require the Internal Revenue Service
to be less harsh on a taxpayer who tries to comply with the law but
fails than on one who makes no effort to comply.
   It also aims to reduce chances that a taxpayer will be hit with
two or more civil penalties for the same shortcoming.
   The committee, meeting behind closed doors, added the provision
to a package that eventually is expected to include spending cuts
and revenue increases required to reduce the budget deficit.
   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, said that his oversight subcommittee
heard testimony that ``the current penalty structure is a confusing
morass of complex, overlapping penalties that are often unduly harsh
or just plain irrational.''
   The IRS, 35 years ago, had only 13 penalties to enforce. The
increase, authorities say, is due in part to Congress' use of
penalties to raise revenue. The rewriting is based on the notion
that penalties should be used only to encourage compliance, not to
raise money.
   In 1988, the IRS assessed 26 million penalties totaling nearly $6
billion. The IRS supports overhauling the penalty structure.
   Present law imposes a 5 percent penalty for underpayment of tax;
the bill would raise that generally to 20 percent.
   Most of the changes involve penalties on banks and others that
fail to file reports on interest and dividends, and on employers who
miss the deadline for turning over withheld taxes to the IRS.
   In most cases, the revised penalties would be graduated so that
the longer the delay in paying or filing, the higher the penalty.

<HEAD>Says Terrorists Met in Libya to Plan Attack at Frankfurt Airport</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian terrorists met with
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to plan an attack at the Frankfurt
Airport, but an Israeli agent warned West German authorities, Stern
magazine said Tuesday.
   The Hamburg-based magazine said an agent from Mossad, the Israeli
intelligence service, infiltrated the meeting, and his information
prompted last week's security alert at the airport.
   The security measures are still in force at the airport, West
Germany's busiest.
   Police are conducting a nationwide search for suspects, Stern
said.
   It reported the terrorists were planning the attack in an attempt
to gain the release of convicted TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi
and two imprisoned members of the Syrian-backed Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   Stern said the terrorists met with Col. Gadhafi June 10 in
Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   It made no further mention of Gadhafi. The story will be carried
in Stern's Thursday edition, but the magazine sent a summary of the
article to other news media Tuesday.
   Stern said the Israeli agent quoted terrorists at the meeting as
saying: ``The time is right to free the fighters from prison.
   ``It is time to carry out the great attack. The means are in our
hands. We possess a weapon that will drown many in West Germany in
blood and tears.''
   West German security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that the warning of a possible attack came from Mossad.
   Christian Jaletzke, a spokesman for the Hesse state Interior
Ministry that is responsible for security at the Frankfurt Airport,
said he could neither confirm nor deny that Mossad provided the tip.
   But he said the information that had been received was considered
reliable. ``The information ... was of such quality that we had to
step up security,'' he said.
   When security was strengthened last week authorities said the
measures were linked to Hamadi's case.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was convicted by a Frankfurt
court last month of murder and air piracy in the 1985 TWA hijacking
and was sentenced to life imprisonment. A U.S. Navy diver was killed
by the hijackers.
   Stern said that in addition to freeing Hamadi the terrorists
wanted to gain the release of two Popular Front members jailed in
West Germany after a raid in October on suspected terrorist cells in
the Frankfurt and Duesseldorf areas.
   One of the men, Hafez Kassem Dalkamoni, is believed to be a
ranking Popular Front official.
   Police found in his car a bomb concealed in a radio cassette
player that was similar to the device that blew up Pan Am Flight 103
over Scotland in December, killing 270 people.
   Stern said a search of Dalkamoni's apartment in Frankfurt turned
up evidence of an underground arms cache, but it was empty.
   It added that police using dogs are searching for explosives in
wooded areas around the airport.
   The Reagan administration accused Gadhafi's regime of supporting
international terrorism, and on April 14, 1986, U.S. warplanes
bombed the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi. Gadhafi repeatedly
has denied he supports terrorist actions.

   A new apartment building collapsed,
killing at least 14 people, authorities said Tuesday.
   The building collapsed Monday night, trapping workers and their
families under debris, police said on condition of anonymity.
   Six people were killed immediately and eight died of injuries,
doctors said. At least 15 people were seriously injured, they said.
   The victims included five members of a family in which only a
2-year-old girl survived.
   Construction on the building was complete, but it had not been
opened to residents, police said. Most of the victims were laborers
and their families asleep on the ground floor, police said.
   Press Trust of India quoted police as saying they were looking
for builders who allegedly supplied sub-standard cement.
   United News of India said two people were arrested but did not
identify them.

<HEAD>House, Senate Panels Differ on Pace of Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House member whose subcommittee is crafting
rural development legislation says he wants to move slowly but
surely, despite the desire in the Senate to push such a measure
through quickly.
   ``We're taking a different approach,'' said Rep. Glenn English,
D-Okla., whose subcommittee is holding a lengthy series of hearings
before crafting legislation early this fall.
   ``We're reaching outside Washington,'' said English. ``We will
have heard from over 40 witnesses by the time we finish hearings
this month.''
   He also has scheduled hearings in five regions of the country in
August.
   English said the House Agriculture subcommittee on conservation,
credit and rural development is moving as quickly as it can, but he
doesn't understand the ``push it through approach'' being taken by
the Senate.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. and chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, was joined by several other Democratic senators, the
National Association of Development Organizations and the National
Association of Counties at a news conference Tuesday promoting his
bill.
   ``One of the reasons we worked so hard to get this out is so that
it won't be perceived as a farm bill,'' said Leahy. ``Ninety percent
of rural America is not involved in farming.''
   English said that timing will determine whether the legislation
is incorporated into the 1990 omnibus bill that sets farm policy for
several years.
   ``There are some good points about that legislation (Leahy's
bill), and I think it is fine as far as it goes,'' English said. ``I
don't think legislation drawn up by any one house is going to be the
best approach to all the problems in rural America.''
   English said the House might pass a rural development bill by
this December, but his timetable is geared for passage of a law
before the session's end in December 1990.
   He said he expects a conference committee comprising members of
both the House and Senate to bring the measures together.
   Legislation to aid rural communities is considered necessary
because steady loss of job opportunities, deteriorating roads,
bridges and other infrastructure, and declining education are
driving people away.
   But such legislation is more difficult to pass in the House than
in the Senate, because urban districts hold the majority in the
House.
   English has warned that unless something is done to reverse the
trend, cities will be greatly overburdened.
   Leahy calls his bill ``landmark legislation'' that he has waited
15 years to see passed.
   ``This bill has three basic purposes,'' he said.
   It will provide capital for new businesses in the form of
revolving loans, set up satellite educational and health
communication systems and provide funds for improving drinking water.
   Leahy claimed he has strong support in the Senate now that the
interests of those seeking drought legislation have been met.
   A snag developed last week when Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., threatened
to block the bill if the agriculture committee didn't pass his
relief legislation for winter wheat farmers whose crops were
destroyed by drought.
   Leahy has scheduled hearings on the drought measure next month
with both it and his rural development bill to receive floor action
the same day, soon after the July 4 break.
   Economic development officials from the rural South complained,
however, that Leahy's bill will help rural areas with the worst
economic problems.
   The officials questioned whether the most economically depressed
rural areas will be able to use the centerpiece of the legislation _
$300 million to start or expand revolving loan funds _ because of
its requirement that the federal aid be matched by local sources.
   Most poor areas can't afford those matching funds, they said.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Commerce Committee approved
legislation on Tuesday to improve highway safety by toughening
penalties for drug sales at truck stops and highway rest areas.
   The legislation also would prohibit trucking companies from
hauling hazardous materials and bus companies from carrying
passengers if they receive an ``unsatisfactory'' safety rating from
the Transportation Department.
   The measure, sent to the full Senate, provides for doubling and
tripling of existing penalties for crimes involving drug sales at
truck stops and rest areas. It also would establish minimum jail
sentences _ one year for first convictions and three years for
repeat offenders.
   The maximum penalties will vary according to the crime a person
is charged with.
   Supporters of the measure say they hope to reduce drug use by
truck drivers. They contend that rest areas and truck stops have
increasingly become markets for drug trafficking.
   The bill also would require the Transportation Department to make
random inspections of vehicles that are removed from service because
of safety problems, take enforcement actions against companies for
serious safety violations, and establish a regulation to improve
truck braking performance.
   ``This is a major step to end big truck accidents that tie up
major highways and claim more than 5,000 lives a year and cost the
public millions of dollars,'' said David F. Snyder, counsel for the
American Insurance Association, which represents companies providing
one-third of the insurance to the nation's commercial truckers.

   The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday
approved $200 million to begin construction next year of the
supercollider atom-smasher, a gigantic machine for probing the
secrets of matter.
   Under the supercollider provisions of an appropriations bill for
the Energy Department and the Army Corps of Engineers, $110 million
could be used to initiate construction of the $4.4 billion,
53-miles-around accelerator at a site south of Dallas, with the
balance for research and development on what would be the largest
scientific instrument ever built.
   The Bush administration had sought $250 million.
   The collider project faces significant opposition, not least from
members who believe it will starve other worthy projects of funds.
The bill is expected to come to the House floor next week.
   One backer of the project, Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas, said,
``People who oppose the super collider do so with some jeopardy,''
because of the scores of energy and water projects in the spending
package that affect many members' districts.
   The Committee approved the super collider appropriation without
dissent.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall was found guilty
Tuesday on all nine counts of lying to a federal grand jury about a
money-laundering scheme, and he faces at least 10 months in prison.
   ``Obviously, I'm very disappointed,'' Swindall said, pledging to
appeal. ``We'll be trying this case again, and, I hope, not in
Atlanta.''
   He insisted publicity kept him from getting a fair trial in
Atlanta, where Swindall, a Republican, spent two terms representing
the eastern suburbs before voters denied him re-election in November
after his indictment.
   He had hoped for an acquittal and a 1990 race against Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga. But Swindall, 38, faces 10 months to five years in
prison on each perjury count. Probation is not an option under
federal sentencing guidelines, which Swindall supported in Congress.
He also faces fines of up to $250,000 on each of the nine felony
counts.
   Swindall looked on impassively as the verdict was read, his
wife's hand on his back. He will be sentenced Aug. 25.
   He was accused of lying to a federal grand jury about his
month-long 1987 negotiations with an undercover Internal Revenue
Service agent, who posed as a drug-money launderer, and with a
Swindall supporter later convicted of money laundering.
   In exchange for a promissory note he held, Swindall was seeking
$850,000 from the agent to finish building his suburban home. The
money was to be funneled to Swindall through a mortgage company
created by his friend and political supporter, Charles LeChasney.
   The nine counts represented nine subject areas in which Swindall
was accused of making 20 false statements to the grand jury on Feb.
2, 1988. The jury found 18 of the statements to be deliberate,
willful lies. U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman dismissed a
10th count earlier.
   ``I could have understood one or two counts, but I just don't
understand this,'' Swindall said.
   The jury found that he lied when he said he didn't recall being
told the money included narcotics dollars, when he said he never
agreed to accept the money and when he said a $150,000 check he
received, but later returned, had nothing to do with the deal.
   ``To me, this is among the most important, if not the most
important, case we've handled,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Barr. He
noted that Swindall, as a congressman, not only swore to uphold the
laws but helped make them.
   Swindall, a lawyer, said the trial included at least two ``very
reversible errors'' which he hopes will win him a new trial:
Freeman's dismissal of the testimony of U.S. Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., that House members have an overwhelming workload, and a
prosecutor's remark concerning the possible motivation of defendants
to testify during criminal trials.
   Swindall did not testify in his own defense.
   Neither of those two areas, however, went directly to the bulk of
the evidence in the case: hours of secretly tape-recorded
conversations among Swindall, LeChasney and IRS agent Michael
Mullaney.
   In those tapes, heard by the jury, Swindall was told the money he
was seeking ``certainly'' included drug money and that he would be
part of an operation to ``wash'' cash.
   Asked what killed Swindall's chances for acquittal, his lead
attorney, Richard Hendrix, replied, ``I imagine, the tapes.''
   Swindall said later that he regrets he ever testified before the
grand jury. ``Absolutely. I'd advise anybody in the future to take
the Fifth,'' he said, referring to the constitutional provision
against self-incrimination.
   Swindall, who had expressed the hope of launching a campaign
against Nunn following the trial, said he is now ``considering a
number of different career options. One of those I've got to put
into the blend is a prison ministry.
   ``I will go where God sends me. ... God doesn't make mistakes.''
   The lanky, boyish-looking Swindall won his House seat in a 1984
upset, in which he campaigned on favorite issues of fundamentalist
Christians against Democrat Elliott Levitas, who is Jewish. Swindall
was defeated last November by Democrat Ben Jones, a former TV actor
in ``The Dukes of Hazzard.''
   In his two terms, Swindall staunchly voted with the Reagan right
and acquired a reputation as somewhat of a gadfly, voting against
such popular programs as school lunch funding and aid to African
famine victims.

<HEAD>Judge Says Vet's Flag Makes Too Much Noise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 20-year Navy veteran whose American
flag made a lot of noise when the wind blew was convicted Tuesday of
violating the city's noise ordinance.
   Each morning as the sun rises, Lee Bach has unrolled his flag,
which is 3 feet by 5 feet, and hoisted it up a 40-foot flagpole. He
has followed the ritual for about two years since moving to his
house.
   ``I always said that when I had a house built, I'd put in a flag
pole and fly the flag properly,'' said Bach, who was stationed
aboard the USS Bennington during World War II.
   His neighbor, Gena Contreras, filed a public nuisance charge
against Bach when Bach failed to comply with her request that he not
fly his flag while she is at home.
   Municipal Judge Jose Coronado said he found Bach guilty, but
deferred sentencing for 30 days, ``during which time I'm hoping both
parties get together and work out something agreeable to both.''
   ``If it's brought bo my attention that they weren't able to reach
an agreement, then I'm in a position to enter a sentence,'' Coronado
said.
   Municipal court can impose a maximum penalty of $300 and 90 days
in jail, Coronado said.

<HEAD>UMW Officials Freed, Invigorated By Wildcat Strikes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of wildcat strikers caused traffic
jams to slow coal shipments Tuesday, and three union leaders were
released from a two-week jail stay brought about by strike activity
against mines in Virginia.
   ``Together, we can win this strike,'' said Marty Hudson, the
field commander of the United Mine Workers-authorized strike by
1,900 Pittston Coal Group Inc. employees in Virginia, West Virginia
and Kentucky.
   A federal judge's June 5 decision to hold the three in jail
without bond until they promised an end to the civil disobedience
against Pittston has been a rallying point for the wildcat strikes.
   Those strikes, work stoppages not officially authorized by the
UMW, have idled about 28,000 miners in nine states.
   Hundreds of the wildcat strikers converged on the southwest
Virginia coalfields and took part Tuesday in traffic jams designed
to slow Pittston's coal shipments.
   ``They've just got the place saturated with people; it's pretty
well blocked up,'' said state police Lt. C.F. Eaton.
   Hudson said the wildcat strikers realize that if Pittston is
successful in breaking away from a national contract and weakening
job security and benefits, other companies may follow suit.
   ``They see what Pittston is doing as a threat to their unions,''
Hudson said. ``If Pittston is successful, it will directly affect
their lives.''
   Hudson, Jackie Stump, president of the UMW's southwest Virginia
district, and C.A. Phillips, a UMW international representative,
were jailed after U.S. District Judge Glen Williams found them
guilty of contempt of court.
   Williams said the three violated his order banning sit-down
demonstrations to block coal trucks at Pittston's processing plants.
   They were freed by Williams after promising during a private
hearing here Tuesday to abide by his order.
   The three said they purged themselves of the contempt charge
because striking miners and supporters told them their leadership
was needed and their testimony was needed by demonstrators arrested
in sit-down protests.
   ``This strike is still building,'' Hudson told the crowd. He told
reporters the decision to promise to comply with strike restrictions
in order to get out of jail was not a surrender.
   ``There are no white flags in these hands. We're going to win
this strike. We're not turning back,'' Hudson said before holding up
a bandanna printed in camouflage, the symbol of the striking miners.
   Chuck Donnelly, an attorney for the UMW in West Virginia, said
the release of the three should bring an end to the wildcat walkouts.
   ``It sounds like a cause for celebration,'' Donnelly said.
   But Roger Caldwell, a field representative in the UMW's District
17, said the unauthorized strikes probably will continue as miners
turn attention to the $3 million in fines levied against the UMW by
a circuit court judge in Lebanon, Va.
   Caldwell was proven correct when about 350 workers at two Indiana
mines ignored a federal judge's order to end their wildcat strike,
and 350 United Mine Workers in Missouri refused to go back to work
and walked out of a meeting with union officials.
   The nearly 1,700 UMW employees walked off their Pittston jobs in
Virginia and West Virginia on April 5 after working more than 14
months without a contract. The strike spread to Pittston's Kentucky
operations Monday, idling another 200 UMW members.
   The unauthorized walkouts began last week after a UMW rally in
Charleston to protest Pittston's failure to sign a nationwide
contract and to protest the fines and jail terms assessed union
members in Virginia.

   President Bush is even more popular than his
predecessor, but Congress is increasingly unpopular, according to an
ABC-Washington Post poll released Tuesday.
   Bush's approval rating after nearly six months in office is 73
percent positive, according to the random telephone survey.
   That ties with President Reagan's all-time high of 73 percent
positive recorded just after he was wounded in an assassination
attempt in 1981.
   Bush has averaged a 72 percent positive rating since he took
office in January, compared with Reagan's 66 percent approval rating
during roughly the same period of his presidency, according to
ABC-Washington Post polls.
   A total of 54 percent of those polled said Bush had been as tough
as needed in response to the political upheaval in China, while 38
percent said his response had been too weak.
   The poll found that those interviewed were disenchanted with
Congress in the wake of the resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright
over allegations of ethics violations.
   Congress' approval rating fell from 54 percent in May to 37
percent in June, the poll found. That is the lowest rating recorded
for Congress in any ABC-Washington Post poll since the question
began being asked in 1985, the news agencies said in a release.
   Pollsters interviewed 1,546 people 18 and older from June 15-19.
The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain Causes Flooding In Southeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the Southeast to
the lower Great Lakes on Tuesday, producing locally heavy rain that
caused some flooding in Alabama and Tennessee.
   Elsewhere, early afternoon temperatures climbed into the 90s from
southwestern Minnesota across the central and southern Plains to the
desert Southwest, while light snow was falling at Butte, Mont.
   Thunderstorms deluged Wadley, Ala., with more than 5 inches of
rain during the morning, with much of that falling in a three-hour
period. Some streets and roads were closed by water in Wadley and
other locations in Randolph County. Roads and low-lying areas also
were flooded in Tallapoosa County in southern Alabama, the National
Weather Service said.
   Hiram Taylor, coordinator of the Tallapoosa County Emergency
Management Agency, said 15 to 20 families were evacuated Tuesday
from homes in low-lying areas. He said flooding had destroyed at
least half of the county's cotton crop.
   Heavy rain also fell across northern Georgia, including 2.5
inches at Jonesboro and more than 2 inches at Atlanta. Clayton got
3.5 inches and Gainesville picked up 3 inches. Streams in Habersham
County, Ga., overflowed and some roads were flooded, the weather
service said.
   Nearly 2 inches of rain fell overnight at Newfound Gap, Tenn.,
and at higher elevations of the Great Smoky Mountains, and the
weather service said some roads and bridges were flooded near
Oakdale, Tenn.
   Eastern Tennessee also had a rock slide that closed Interstate 40
near Rockwood and flooding that required the evacuation of about 40
people from their homes in Rhea County, authorities said.
   After four years of drought, Tennessee has had more rain than
normal this year, including 6.8 inches above normal at Memphis, 7.12
inches above at Nashville and 6.06 inches above at Knoxville.
   The Tennessee Valley Authority was caught between storing as much
water as possible in its reservoirs and letting enough water out to
save room for future flood control. Every lake in the system was
full by Tuesday afternoon, said Larry Richardson, manager of water
resources operations.
   He said water was spilling out of reservoirs and an estimated
5,000 to 6,000 acres of cropland below Pickwick Dam near Savannah in
western Tennessee was under water.
   To the north, there was a threat of flooding along the Genessee
River in western New York state after 1.75 inches of rain soaked
Getzville, N.Y., northeast of Buffalo.
   Some streams also were reported out of their banks in western
Pennsylvania, the weather service said.
   Heavy thunderstorms also hit parts of central Maryland, with
Baltimore getting 1.5 inches of rain in only 15 minutes, and Bowie
got over 3.5 inches of rain.
   Thunderstorms generated high wind across parts of North Carolina,
with a small tornado reported in southern Wake County, but no damage
was reported.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Butte, Mont., to 110 at Needles, Calif. Tuesday's low for
the Lower 48 states was 30 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   For Wednesday, numerous showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the mid and southern Atlantic Coast states to the upper Ohio
Valley. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast from much
of New England across southern Lower Michigan, the lower Ohio and
Tennessee valleys to the central Gulf Coast. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms also were forecast from the upper Mississippi Valley
across the northern and central Plains to the central Rockies.
Widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms were forecast from the
southwestern Plains across the southern Rockies to southeastern
Arizona, with showers over the northern Rockies.
   Highs only in the 50s and 60s were predicted over the northern
Rockies; in the 60s over Washington state; in the 70s and 80s from
the Atlantic Coast states across the Ohio, upper Mississippi and
middle Missouri valleys and the central Rockies to Oregon; in the
90s from the middle and lower Mississippi Valley across the central
and southern Plains, the southern Rockies to the southern Pacific
Coast; and above 100 from the inland valleys of California across
the desert Southwest to southwestern Texas.

<HEAD>Investigator Says He Cast 33 Votes in Election</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An undercover agent for a state commission
pretended to be 33 men and cast 33 ballots at 33 voting sites in the
citywide local school board elections on May 2, the agent testified
Tuesday.
   Leslie Smith, an undercover operative for the Commission on
Integrity of the Public Schools, detailed for the commission Tuesday
how easy it was to register under dozens of fake names and hop from
polling place to polling place.
   Commission chairman James F. Gill emphasized that there was no
evidence that fraud, outside of Smith's, had occurred in the
election.
   He also stressed that Smith filled out each of his ballots
improperly, so that all his votes were invalidated and did not
affect any outcome.
   ``We were getting a lot of information from a lot of sources
indicating that these elections were open to fraud,'' Gill said.
``We decided to find out if there was that kind of systemic weakness
and I think we've demonstrated there is.''
   ``In the old days if you wanted to engage in this kind of voter
fraud, you had to go to the cemetery and take the names of the most
recently deceased off of the gravestones and try to vote those
folks. In this situation, all that had to be done was sit down and
draw up a list of fictitious parents and children,'' Gill said.
   Voting for school boards is open to all registered voters and to
all parents of children in the schools, regardless of whether they
are registered voters.
   Smith and a commission lawyer made up 84 men's names and gave
each a fictitious child. A parent registration card was filled out
and mailed to the Board of Election for each fake name.
Seventy-three of the 84 names made the voter list of the Board of
Election; 11 registration cards evidently were lost, Smith said.
   On Election Day he went to all 35 polling sites within the two
districts, but voted only 33 times because his registration cards
could not be found at two schools.
   Under state law, the Board of Education is supposed to weed the
rolls of ineligible parents and certify legitimate voters to the
Board of Election. But Aaron Maslow, the Board of Elections counsel,
said the Board of Education did little more than give blanket
certification.

<HEAD>Sakharov Says Gorbachev Could Be Ousted in a Coup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei Sakharov said Tuesday the Soviet Union is at
a turning point, and if the worst happened President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev could be the victim of a military coup by conservative
elements.
   The Soviet human rights activist, in a lecture at the Royal
Institute of International Affairs, said: ``The country is at the
crossroads and faces major reforms. From this position the country
can go either way. If it goes too far there could be a fascist
military coup, especially from the right, which is the conservative
element.''
   He told the audience, which included representatives of the
Soviet Embassy, that the West should be cautious about overtures to
the Soviet Union.
   Western aid could be like pouring water into the sand and might
prevent necessary reforms, he said.
   ``The important thing is not to undertake new initiatives,''
Sakharov added. ``Wait for real change in the political system.''
   He noted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is considered a
supporter of the reform-minded Soviet president.
   ``The caution she is observing now (toward Gobachev) is
justified,'' he said. ``It does not contradict her earlier policy.
It is a revision of that policy taking account of existing
circumstances.''
   Commenting on the Soviet Union, he said: ``I suppose our country
is now one of the last, if not the last, world colonial power. If
this problem is not going to be solved in a constitutional, rational
way the destruction or downfall of our country is inevitable.''
   Sakharov, accompanied by his wife Yelena Bonner, is on his first
trip to Britain. The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner received an
honorary degree at Sussex University on Monday and is to receive
another honorary degree from Oxford University on Wednesday. He will
meet Mrs. Thatcher on Friday.
   The 68-year-old physicist was elected to the newly formed
Congress of the People's Deputies by the Soviet Academy of Sciences
in April, three years after he was freed from internal exile in the
city of Gorky. He had been sent there as punishment for his
dissident activites, including criticism of the Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   Britain braced for transportation chaos Wednesday
when a 24-hour national rail strike coincides with bus and subway
strikes in London.
   The Court of Appeal on Tuesday refused a request by British Rail
to block the planned walkout by 75,000 workers.
   London's 10,500 subway workers decided Tuesday to go ahead with
their seventh unofficial 24-hour strike this year over pay and
conditions.
   Delegates representing 18,500 bus workers in the Transport and
General Workers Union then decided on a lightning 24-hour strike to
demand a 14 percent pay raise.
   They rejected an offer of between 8 percent and 9 percent, which
London Buses said was ``roughly in line with inflation,'' now
running at 8.3 percent. The company said a bus driver operating
without a conductor earns $340 a week.
   The train stoppage will be the first national rail strike since
1982, when London subway workers also refused to work.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher condemned the strikers.
   ``It's a typically selfish policy to put themselves first before
those who have to use it, deliberately causing massive inconvenience
to those who have to work,'' she told the House of Commons.
   British Rail, which says the strike will cost it $15.5 million,
had asked the appeal judges to overrule a High Court refusal to
grant an injunction requiring the National Union of Railwaymen to
cancel the strike.
   The railway said the strike should not be permitted because 200
union members were not able to participate in the strike vote.
   Union members voted 29,675 to 20,704 to strike over British
Rail's proposed 7 percent wage increase and plans to abolish
national wage bargaining.
   The Court of Appeals found no evidence that anyone entitled to
vote was prevented from doing so.
   British Rail offered to return to the negotiating table and urged
staff to ignore the strike call.
   ``We are looking at a pretty well total shutdown,'' said Paul
Watkinson, the state railroad's employee relations director.
   The dispute between London Underground and 10,500 workers on the
capital's sprawling subway network involves introducing trains
operated only by drivers. Drivers want a $99 weekly increase to
operate without a guard.
   Management is offering $46 plus 14 days extra annual vacation,
but is tying the raise to increased productivity.

   South African-led police in Namibia have
created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation that threatens fair
independence elections in the territory, a top U.N. official said
Tuesday.
   Police in armored cars mounted with heavy machine guns apparently
have driven through villages destroying crops and terrorizing local
inhabitants, according to Martti Ahtisaari, the U.N.'s special
representative in Namibia.
   A feared counter-insurgency unit called ``Koevoet,'' Afrikaans
for crowbar, disbanded months ago is behind the terror campaign,
Ahtissari said.
   ``Their activities appear to have created an atmosphere of fear
and intimidation among much of the population in the northern
region,'' Ahtisaari reportedly wrote to Namibia's South African
administrator-general.
   On July 1, campaigning begins for seats in a Namibian constituent
assembly that will draft a constitution and organize the territory's
first black majority-ruled government.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization is expected to win
the November elections, part of a U.N.-mediated peace plan. Most of
SWAPO's popular support comes from the Ovambo tribe in northern
Namibia.
   SWAPO, which fought a 23-year bush war against South African rule
of Namibia, may not capture the two-thirds of the assembly seats
needed to impose one-party rule.
   Many observers believe South Africa is funding political parties
and using the Koevoet police to intimidate SWAPO supporters and stop
the guerrillas from gaining their majority.
   Ahtisaari heads a U.N. commission monitoring Pretoria's
cooperation with a U.N. plan to free Namibia from 74 years of South
African rule.
   He wrote to the South African official, Louis Pienaar, on June 9,
Nadia Younes, a U.N. spokeswoman, said Tuesday. He has received no
reply, she said.
   ``The activities in which (the Koevoet) have been engaged render
its members ... unfit for continued service in the police ... in
view of the need to ensure the necessary conditions for free and
fair elections,'' Ahtissari reportedly wrote.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association agreed Tuesday to
lobby for restrictions on the sale and ownership of assault weapons.
   After spirited debate, delegates at the AMA's policymaking
convention adopted a resolution in support of legislation that would
affect large clip, high rate-of-fire automatic and semi-automatic
firearms, and any weapon that is modified or redesigned to operate
in that manner.
   The proposal is a weaker version of a resolution debated in
committee on Monday calling for a ban on the sale and private
ownership of assault weapons, and does not specify the restrictions
being sought.
   But it still sparked rousing debate as it was presented to the
delegates. The measure ``disarms all of the law-abiding ...
tax-paying citizens of the United States ... and leaves us at the
mercy of the crook, the dope peddler,'' said Dr. F. William Dowda, a
delegate from Georgia.
   The National Rifle Association contends that such legislation
would unfairly restrict guns commonly used by hunters, and that
criminals would still have access to the weapons.
   But Dr. Louis Zako of the Michigan delegation, which submitted
the original proposal calling for an assault weapon ban, denounced
that position.
   ``A real sportsman who can't bag a deer with a slow-fire rifle
ought to give up,'' he told the delegates.
   The measure was among a host of resolutions referred by various
AMA committees to the 433 delegates. Delegates began voting on the
measures Tuesday, and will conclude Thursday, the final day of the
AMA's five-day convention.
   Among other action Tuesday, delegates:
   _Adopted a resolution calling for model state legislation to ban
the sale of alcoholic beverages at gas station convenience stores;
   _Adopted a resolution calling for federal legislation to restrict
the advertising and promotion of beer and other alcoholic beverages;
   _Deferred action on a measure that would require food labels to
list cholesterol content, caloric value and the specific source of
all vegetable oils. The delegates called for a detailed report on
the measure to be submitted by the 1990 annual meeting.

   President Bush ordered new sanctions against
China on Tuesday in retaliation for the government's ``wave of
violence and reprisals'' against the pro-democracy movement.
   Prodded by Congress to take tougher action against Beijing, the
White House said the United States will seek to postpone
consideration of new loans to China by international lending
institutions, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
   One source said Bush's order could freeze $1.4 billion for China
over the next six months from the World Bank and International
Development Bank, although other estimates ranged much higher. A
House Banking Committee member said said China had $4.7 billion
pending at the World Bank alone
   Moreover, Bush ordered U.S. government officials to refrain from
some high-level contacts with the Beijing government. The order does
not affect routine communications between the United States Embassy
and China but bars anyone of assistant secretary rank and above from
taking part in exchange programs.
   ``This action is being taken in response to the wave of violence
and reprisals by the Chinese authorities against those who have
called for democracy,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said in a written statement.
   Earlier Tuesday, the administration made a public plea to Chinese
leaders to grant clemency to protesters sentenced to death and to
pardon people arrested in pro-democracy demonstrations.
   The death sentences, if carried out, ``could only deepen the
wounds of the past few weeks,'' Fitzwater said. He said Bush
directed the State Department on Monday ``to deplore the death
sentences handed down in Shanghai and Beijing and to appeal for
clemency in these cases.''
   In announcing the new sanctions, Fitzwater said the United States
supports ``the legitimate democratic aspirations for freedom of
peoples throughout the world. The U.S. will continue to voice its
concern and its support for these aspirations.''
   Fitzwater said the United States ``hopes that the current tragedy
in China be brought to a peaceful end and that the dialogue will
replace the atmosphere of suspicion and reprisal.''
   ``China is an important state with which we hope to continue
productive relations,'' he said.
   The press spokesman said the situation in China was ``of
international concern as witnessed by the variety of voices that
have spoken up on the issue. We urge continued international
expressions of concern.''
   Even as the new sanctions were announced, moves were afoot in
Congress to prod the administration to tough action.
   Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., introduced a resolution in the
House calling on the president to direct the U.S. directors at the
World Bank and Asian Development Bank to vote against all
multilateral development loans to China.
   The resolution also urged Bush to broaden the effort by seeking
the cooperation of other industrialized democracies at the economic
summit next month in Paris.
   ``This morally bankrupt government does not deserve our
support,'' LaFalce said during a hearing of a House banking
subcommittee, where the resolution was discussed.
   In the Senate, Republicans Frank Murkowski of Alaska and Gordon
Humphrey of New Hampshire criticized U.S. policy toward China as too
tame.
   Murkowski said the Bush administration was ``tip-toeing through
the tulip bed with China'' while Humphrey called the early U.S.
reaction to suppression ``pathetically weak.''
   Eleven demonstrators, denounced as ``counterrevolutionaries,''
have been sentenced to death, three in Shanghai and eight in
Beijing. More than 1,000 other people have been arrested, many of
them students and young workers, as a result of pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   ``We urge the leaders of the Peoples Republic of China to show
clemency to use their powers to pardon those who were arrested in
the demonstration for democracy,'' Fitzwater said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee earlier in the afternoon that he had recommended
to Bush the additional measures against China beyond the suspension
of military sales already announed.
   For instance, Baker said, Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher
would cancel a trip to China scheduled for July 10.
   Congressional Del. Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., said at a House
Banking subcommittee hearing prior to Bush's action that China has
$4.7 billion in loans ``pending or in the pipeline'' at the World
Bank and $1.1 billion being processed by the Asian Development Bank.
   Baker said Chinese ambassador Han Xu had been called to the State
Department Monday evening to receive the U.S. request for clemency
made public by Bush on Tuesday.
   The plea, registered by lawmakers as well, appeared to fall on
deaf ears.
   China's ambassador to the United States, in a heated meeting with
members of Congress, said the turmoil in China was an internal
matter and that foreign countries should not meddle, according to
participants.
   More than a dozen members of Congress went to the Chinese Embassy
and asked that executions be blocked and that judicial decisions be
reviewed.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said they had ``a
very frank exchange of views'' with the ambassador and ``conveyed
the outrage and the deep sense of disappointment that exists among
all the American people about what has transpired in China in the
last few days.''
   Fitzwater said the United States raised its voice ``in the spirit
of a country that has worked with China over the past two decades to
improve relations. But we believe that human rights are universal
and our duty to comment on them is great.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Washington, said: ``Those who
have suggested that the president exercise every option and evoke
every sanction against the Chinese government I think are wrong. ...
these additional sanctions by the president I think will have strong
support in the Congress.''

<HEAD>Deportation Proceedings to Begin Against N.J. Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Justice Department moved Tuesday to begin
deportation proceedings against an elderly New Jersey man accused of
being a Nazi propagandist during World War II.
   The Justice Department charged Ferenc Koreh, 79, of Englewood,
N.J., of advocating the persecution of Jews and the defeat of the
Allies during World War II when he edited a newspaper in Hungary,
which was an ally of Nazi Germany.
   Besides editing the newspaper Szkelely Nep from 1941 through
1944, the department said Koreh was a press officer for the
Hungarian Minister of Propaganda and later edited a government-run
publication.
   Reached at his home by telephone, Koreh would say only, ``I will
certainly fight it.''
   In 1947, the People's Court of Budapest convicted Koreh of war
crimes in connection with his editorship of the government
publication, which supported the German war effort, according to the
government's lawsuit.
   The department's Office of Special Investigations charged in the
lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Newark that Koreh concealed
his wartime activities and his war-crimes conviction from U.S.
immigration officials.
   Koreh was admitted to the United States as a displaced person in
1950 and began as a naturalized citizen in 1956.
   The complaint noted that when he edited the newspaper, Koreh
wrote and published anti-Semitic propaganda, including pieces
entitled ``Disloyal, Unscrupulous, Cheating Jews in the Pages of
Hungarian History.''
   The newspaper also advocated the defeat of the United States
during the war, the department charged.
   OSI Director Neal M. Sher said 30 individuals have been
denaturalized and 27 have been deported. He said 600 people are
under investigation by the deparment's Nazi-hunting unit.

   A leading Republican senator accused fellow GOP
lawmakers and conservatives Tuesday of ``downright deliberate
deceit'' in attacks on a major child care package and said the
Republican alternative paled in comparison.
   ``It's really irritating to see the misinformation and downright
false information that has been spread around this body,'' said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   ``I get a little tired of seeing partisanship and seeing people
playing with this issue,'' said Hatch, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Labor Committee. Hatch crossed party lines to co-sponsor the
bill, which is backed mostly by Democrats.
   Hatch twice took the floor to denounce the tactics of Republicans
and conservative groups, singling out the Eagle Forum for
distributing ``shameful'' information he said misrepresented the
child care package he supports.
   Hatch's criticism of fellow conservatives highlighted a day that
was to be spent debating an alternative child care package to be
offered by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole.
   Dole had promised to present the alternative Tuesday but did not
do so. GOP aides said the Republican leadership was lobbying
Southern Democratic senators in hopes of gaining enough support for
its proposal to present it on Wednesday.
   Democratic leaders predicted the GOP effort would fail.
   The majority leader, George Mitchell, D-Maine, warned senators he
would delay a Senate recess scheduled to begin next week if a final
vote on child care is delayed past Friday. ``We're going to stay
here as long as it takes,'' Mitchell said.
   The only amendment considered before debate ended for the day was
approved unanimously on a voice vote. It rolled back from 16 to 13
the maximum age for a child to be eligible for grant money under the
program.
   Floor debate resumed after both parties held caucuses. During the
Republican meeting, Hatch said GOP senators were given a memo
attacking the Act for Better Child Care sponsored by him and Sen.
Christopher Dodd., D-Conn.
   Hatch said the memo was full of ``downright deliberate deceit, as
though that's the way it should be.'' Later, Hatch said the memo was
not on the letterhead of any senator or group. ``I do not know who
prepared this piece of junk,'' he said.
   Hatch did not refer to any of his GOP colleagues by name, but
many Republicans, including Dole, have sharply criticized the ABC
bill. Hatch, Dodd and other Democrats have said many of the
criticisms are not valid because the current bill has been revised
substantially from Dodd's original proposal.
   ``I regret that I have to spend time answering charges that don't
relate to this legislation,'' Dodd said. ``We've spent the last two
days arguing about myths.''
   As revised, the ABC bill would authorize $1.75 billion for child
care programs in fiscal 1990, with 70 percent of the money going to
low-income parents to help them pay for child care. The remaining
funds would go to the states for programs to improve the quality and
quantity of available child care.
   The amended bill leaves regulatory decisions to the states; the
original included federal regulations that faced staunch GOP
opposition.
   Tacked on to the Dodd-Hatch bill were two proposals approved by
the Senate Finance Committee, a new, up-to-$500, tax credit to help
families pay for health insurance for children and a provision
making refundable the existing dependent care tax credit.
   The Republican alternative Dole planned to offer _ with the
blessing of the White House _ would rely almost entirely on tax
credits to help parents pay for child care. It too would make the
dependent-care credit refundable and create a new child care tax
credit for low-income families with children up to 4 years old. The
Dole proposal also would create a $400 million block grant program
to help states expand child care opportunities.

<TEXT>
   A top Republican political consultant
acknowledged Tuesday he used ``influence peddling'' to steer
millions of dollars in government renovation funds to a housing
project that he owned in part.
   Paul Manafort, a one-time adviser to the campaigns of Presidents
Bush and Reagan and a former business partner of GOP National
Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, also told a House subcommittee that
the $326,000 fee his lobbying firm charged for helping to obtain the
government money was the going rate for such services.
   The housing project in southern New Jersey, approved by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development late in the Reagan
administration, was denounced as wasteful by Democratic and
Republican members of Congress and by local officials from the
7,000-person township where it is located, Upper Deerfiel.
   Manafort said his firm was to provide public relations and
lobbying services for the project. When pressed on what those
services entailed, he conceded, ``I would stipulate that for the
purposes of today, you could characterize this as influence
peddling.''
   ``I think it is a horrible waste of taxpayers' money,'' said
Bruce T. Peterson, the mayor, after learning that with tax credits,
rent subsidies and repair grants the project was costing the federal
government about $43 million.
   Peterson said local officials were told nothing about the project
until well after the developers and their paid consultants started
going after the federal money.
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., later said he believed that the
project was not worthy of federal funds in the first place.
   The housing project is a complex of 326 apartments built in the
1940s that had become dilapidated over the years.
   In April 1987, CFM Development Corp., of which Manafort is one of
three principal owners, bought the project for $4.4 million _ at
least $1 million more than township officials said the land and
buildings were worth.
   About a month later the state housing authority ran an
advertisement announcing the availability of government funds to fix
up such projects. About two weeks later, Manafort's group, the only
one to apply, was awarded $5.5 million to fix up the buildings.
   In his testimony Tuesday before the housing and employment
subcommittee of the Government Operations Committee, Manafort
repeatedly said the development company was taking risks because
there was no guarantee that it would get the money from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. As proof, he cited an
advertisement, which ran just once and in just one newspaper,
soliciting applications from developers.
   ``Nobody in this world believes that you had any doubt'' the
money would come through, said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   Holding up a copy of the advertisement, Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., said, ``You could have cut out all this language and written
one sentence: The fix is in.''
   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., just read the
advertisement out loud: It invited developers to apply for HUD funds
but said the money was only for projects with more than 100
apartments and ``must be located in the city of Seabrook.''
   There is no such city in New Jersey. Seabrook is the name of the
housing project.
   ``This was about as phony an advertisement as you have ever
seen,'' Lantos said. ``This was a sham and an illusion that it was
publicly advertised.''
   Manafort testified that before the developers bought the property
his lobbying firm, Black, Manafort, Stone &amp; Kelly, had already spent
months contacting state and federal officials, including Deborah
Gore Dean, an assistant to then-Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   Ms. Dean is a key figure in investigations of allegations that
HUD money to rehabilitate run-down housing for the poor and elderly
was handed out to developers who hired high-priced political
consultants with ties to the Republican Party or the Reagan
administration.
   Earlier this month Ms. Dean appeared before the same subcommittee
but refused to answer any questions on the grounds that to do so
would violate her constitutional rights against self-incrimination.
   Manafort is not the only Republican who is said to have benefited
by access to HUD during the eight years of the Reagan presidency.
Former Interior Secretary James Watt, former Sen. Edward Brooke of
Massachusetts and the late John Mitchell, attorney general during
the Nixon administration, all made thousands of dollars by helping
others get money from the department.
   On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Robert Weinberger, a
nephew of Reagan's defense secretary, was a consultant who helped a
St. Paul, Minn. housing project get funds.

   Authorities arrested more students involved in the
pro-democracy movement, the government said Tuesday, and it
stiffened visa requirements in what appeared to be an move to keep
others from fleeing.
   President Bush ordered new sanctions on China to retaliate for
the military's crackdown on the movement this month, and the United
States urged China to spare the lives of the 11 demonstrators
sentenced to death and to pardon all those arrested.
   China maintained its surveillance of foreign journalists, and the
Canadian government said it would lodge a formal protest after a
Canadian reporter said authorities tried to abduct her.
   A Beijing University student who was one of the leaders of the
democracy movement was caught and returned to the capital, the
official media reported.
   Liu Gang, 28, was apprehended Monday in Hebei province south of
Beijing, radio and televison news reports said.
   Liu was one of 21 students on a wanted list the government issued
last week. They are accused of masterminding the seven weeks of
demonstrations for greater freedom and an end to official corruption.
   Six of those students have been arrested or have turned
themselves in. Authorities say they have arrested more than 1,360
people for participating in the democracy movement.
   A student who was not on the wanted list was arrested and accused
of ``spreading rumors'' to the U.S. government radio Voice of
America, the People's Daily said Tuesday.
   Tens of millions of Chinese listen to the VOA, a main target of
criticism by the Chinese government, whicates might do if
China carried out the executions.
   In a move apparently designed to tighten the dragnet around
pro-democracy activists, the Chinese government invalidated all exit
permits issued before Tuesday. Chinese must obtain the permits when
seeking visas to travel abroad.
   Chinese police guarding foreign consular offices turned away visa
applicants who did not have the permits. Only three applicants who
approached the U.S. Consulate had obtained the permit, officials aid.
   Chinese who had camped outside some Western embassies for almost
a week said they feared the new regulation would cause delays that
might make them miss the beginning of school terms this summer and
fall.
   Chinese authorities detained a CBS News TV crew for 2{ hours
Tuesday for filming near Tiananmen Square. A CBS reporter said
police confiscated the identity papers of the three crew members but
later returned them and ordered the crew to obey martial law
regulations that ban coverage of the democracy movement.
   The three left for Hong Kong later in the day, although they had
not been ordered to leave, the reporter said.
   The government has ordered six foreign journalists to leave China
for violating martial law regulations imposed in Beijing on May 20.
   A senior Canadian Embassy diplomat said he will meet with Chinese
Foreign Ministry officials Wednesday to protest what he called the
``attempted abduction'' of a Canadian newspaper correspondent.
   Jan Wong, a Canadian-Chinese working for the Toronto Globe and
Mail, said two men tried to force her into a car Monday evening,
saying they wanted to talk to her, but they released her when she
screamed and attracted a crowd. She said the men were in plain
clothes and she believed they were policemen.
   ``We are quite disturbed about the incident and would like to
have some clarification about what it means,'' said Daniel
Dhavernas, minister-counselor at the Canadian Embassy.
   State-run media continued to focus on the families of soldiers
killed on the crackdown, showing the relatives meeting with senior
leaders.
   The families of three soldiers who were beaten to death, thrown
off bridges or set on fire by enraged mobs June 4 met with Beijing
Mayor Chen Xitong and former President Li Xiannen.
   In previous days, the families met with Premier Li Peng and
President Yang Shangkun.
   The news also showed busy factories and students back at school.
   Workers at a major hotel and a restaurant said they were being
ordered back to work on Tuesday and Wednesday, but that they were
required to write reports about their activities since June 3.
   They said they also were ordered to devote half a day Tuesday to
studying a June 9 speech by senior leader Deng Xiaoping calling on
Chinese to unite behind the Communist Party.

   Official results Tuesday confirmed that
Solidarity clinched 260 of the 261 seats it was allowed to contest
in the new National Assembly, guaranteeing the union a veto over
Communist Party legislation.
   But two days after Sunday's voting, politicians from both sides
already were turning attention to the election of Poland's first
president in 37 years.
   Results issued by the National Electoral Commission showed
Solidarity holding 99 of 100 seats in the Senate, the East bloc's
first democratically elected parliament chamber.
   The independent union also gained 161 seats in the lower house,
the Sejm, compared to 299 seats held by the Communist-led coalition.
That gave the Communist coalition 65 percent of Sejm seats and
Solidarity 35 percent, the ratio permitted under a pre-election
bargain.
   But the Communist Party had only 173 of the coalition seats,
making it technically a minority. Minor pro-government Catholic
groups made up the remainder of coalition places.
   And among the Communist coalition's seats, at least 46 were
progressives endorsed by Solidarity. Several prominent hard-line
Communists were defeated.
   ``There is hope that in the new Sejm we will find partners who
understand our causes and who, like us, favor the process of
reform,'' Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said Tuesday.
   The two sides in the Assembly will be roughly balanced so that
``either there will be cooperation between the coalition and the
opposition or we will face a chain of conflicts that will block the
legislative process,'' said government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski.
   In a next step, the National Assembly convenes within 30 days to
choose a president. The Communist coalition enters the meeting with
about 40 more votes than the opposition, although there could be
defections.
   Choosing the president is the last stage of the political bargain
struck April 5 between the Solidarity-led opposition and Communist
authorities after two months of talks.
   The accord led to the restoration of Solidarity's legal status
after a seven-year ban and the holding of Eastern Europe's freest
parliamentary elections since World War II.
   The new president will sign legislation and be commander-in-chief
of the armed forces. The president will serve one six-year term.
   Poland had five presidents between 1918, when the modern Polish
state was established, and 1952, when the office was abolished by
the Communist Party.
   The president in turn will nominate the next prime minister, who
will form a government.
   Although Communist Party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who now
leads the country, is assumed to be the party's candidate, his
spokesman last week said he still has not decided to run.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have discovered air
pollution over much of Africa, and it is chemically similar to the
smog that plagues southern California, a research leader said
Tuesday.
   Meinrat Andreae, a chemist with West Germany's Max Planck
Institute, said the deliberate burning of huge savanna areas
produces acid rain and ozone pollution that settles over Africa's
rain forests.
   ``These levels we've seen over the rain forests are dramatically
higher than anything anybody has seen over rain forests before,''
Andreae said in a telephone interview.
   Andreae headed the West German group in a 20-member project that
included scientists from France and the Congo.
   He said his team spent two weeks in the field in the Congo in
February and March of 1988.
   Africa's air pollution is ``a combination of atmospheric
pollutants which is very similar to the sort of smog-type chemistry
that you get in southern California,'' Andreae said.
   ``When the smoke plume spends some time in the atmosphere and has
the sunshine burning on top of it, you start photochemical reactions
just like in any old smog situation in southern California.''
   He said the acidity and ozone levels are similar to those in some
industrialized areas of North America and Europe, and he noted such
levels damage plants, lakes and forests.
   ``There is no reason ... to assume that the equatorial forests
should be more resistant to these sort of pollutant impacts than
those in temperate regions,'' Andreae added.
   He said that while the team's field work was done in the Congo
that country is not a source of the pollutants.
   The area affected by the pollution runs from the ``southern edge
of the Sahara down to South Africa,'' he said. ``It's a phenomenon
that essentially covers all of tropical Africa.
   ``Any country where there are savannas there will be large-scale
burning, typically once a year, sometimes every two years. All the
savannas are burned periodically for agricultural purposes. The
farmers like to burn the shrub and grass in order to remove the old
dry grass and get the fresh grass to sprout.
   ``The amount of burning is increasing rather dramatically, and
also the area covered by burns,'' he said. ``There are more people _
the population of all those regions is growing dramatically.''
   Andreae is a director of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry
in Mainz.

   Security forces shot and
wounded four protesters and looters Tuesday on the second day of a
general strike over rising prices and poor services, an independent
radio report said.
   At least three civilians were reported killed and a dozen wounded
in street battles Monday when this impoverished Caribbean nation
began a 48-hour nationwide stoppage.
   Francisco Antonio Santos, leader of the General Workers' Union,
told reporters they may call a new strike if the government fails to
meet demands.
   President Joaquin Balaguer met for a second day with Roman
Catholic archbishops trying to mediate with the strikers. The
clergymen were to meet strike leaders later Tuesday.
   Radio Popular said security forces wounded two youths, one
seriously, when they opened fire to stop a mob trying to plunder a
grocery store in La Vega, 85 miles north of Santo Domingo.
   In Barahona, 125 miles southwest of the capital, soldiers fired
at youths burning tires in the street and wounded two, the report
said.
   Normally jammed streets of Santo Domingo, a city of 1.6 million,
were virtually deserted for a second day.
   Armed soldiers and police patrolled the capital, where stores,
restaurants and office buildings remained closed. Banks shut down
after opening Monday under police and military guard.
   Strikers want better public services, price freezes and a
doubling of salaries for government workers, who earn a monthly
average of $65.
   Power cuts and water shortages plague this island nation of 6.5
million people, and inflation has hit 60 percent a year.
   Balaguer's economic adviser, Juan Jose Artega, said the strike
will cost the country $35 million.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania Congressman Trying To Block Shoreham Shutdown Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., has introduced
legislation to block any federal tax deductions from the plan to
shut the controversial Shoreham nuclear power plant in New York.
   Ritter, who quietly introduced the bill last Thursday, took to
the House floor Tuesday to rally support and seek co-sponsors.
   Ritter objects to the fact that the Long Island Lighting Co.
would be able to write off some $2.8 billion in expenditures if it
sells the plant to New York state for $1 as planned.
   ``Misery loves company but the state of New York doesn't have the
right to share its misery with the American taxpayer,'' Ritter said.
   His measure would alter the tax code to deny any deduction for
unrecovered expenditures on the abandonment of a fully licensed
nuclear plant.
   The bill was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee,
where senior New York Democrats such as Reps. Charles Rangel and
Thomas Downey could be expected to block it.
   Ritter said he was uncertain how the bill would fare in
committee, but ``we're going to leave some big legislative history
behind.''
   Under a plan negotiated by Gov. Mario Cuomo and teh company,
Shoreham would be sold to the state for a symbolic dollar in
exchange for a series of rate increases. Shoreham's license would be
transferred to the Long Island Power Authority, which would contract
with the New York Power Authority to decommission the $5.5 billion
plant.
   The Energy Department has said it will do everything in its power
to keep the plant from being decommission. Deputy Secretary Henson
Moore last week wrote the New York Power Authority that it would
exceed its legal authority if it undertook the decommissioning.
   Cuomo's plan has been approved by everybody involved in New York
except the company shareholders, who vote June 28.

<HEAD>Cuba Accuses Guantanamo Personnel of Violating Sovereignty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>

   A Cuban military newspaper said Tuesday that
servicemen at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo are violating Cuba's
territorial sovereignty.
   In a dispatch monitored here, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina
quoted the newspaper Bastion as saying three incidents occurred this
month.
   It reported Bastion said the latest incident happened June 15
when an American serviceman ducked under the base's northwest fence
and ``illegally occupied'' Cuban territory for four minutes.
   Bastion claimed there were two incidents on June 10 involving
U.S. aircraft. It said a helicopter flew 200 yards over Cuba near
the northwest corner of the base and a small plane violated Cuban
air space from the west.
   The newspaper reported that Defense Minister Raul Castro,
President Fidel Castro's brother, said last week there is an
``escalation of provocations by the United States against Cuba.''
   It said Castro also spoke of ``certain U.S. notes of protests in
April denouncing alleged exploratory penetrations by Cuban
soldiers'' of the base perimeter, and he called those assertions
``absolutely unfounded.''
   The United States has held the base on Cuba's eastern tip for 87
years.

   A Norwegian coast guard ship cut through
thick arctic ice Tuesday and rescued hundreds of people from ice
floes and lifeboats after their Soviet cruise liner hit an iceberg
and took on water.
   Some Soviet crew members stayed aboard the listing 630-foot ocean
liner Maxim Gorky to keep it afloat in the Norwegian Sea.
   The rescue ship and helicopters saved passengers huddling in
blankets in the 37-degree temperatures. No one was seriously hurt.
   About 740 passengers and crew reached the Norwegian arctic
outpost at Spitsbergen more than 25 hours after their ordeal began,
officials said. Passengers were bused immediately to the airport on
the tiny island of 1,000 people for chartered flights back to
Germany.
   Two Soviet planes were to collect the Soviet crew on Wednesday,
said Harald Pettersen, from the administrators office at Spitsbergen
Island.
   The Maxim Gorky was carrying 950 people when it rammed the
iceberg in the foggy arctic twilight shortly after midnight, while
most of the passengers were partying in a shipboard nightclub.
   ``Suddenly there was a terrible crash that almost shook me from
my bed,'' said Rudolf Ludwig, 67, of Wiesbaden, West Germany, one of
the passengers on the midnight sun cruise who was evacuated by
helicopter to Norway's Svalbard island.
   ``We were told to get into the lifeboats,'' Ludwig said. ``We sat
for five hours among the icebergs. The atmosphere was calm, and the
Russian sailors did everything they could. They gave us vodka and
whiskey in the boats, since it was cold. And blankets, too.''
   The iceberg ripped two holes in the ship, which quickly took on
water. Passengers said three decks became submerged.
   The coast guard vessel Senja, its bow reinforced for icebreaking,
rushed to the area, about 300 miles east of northern Greenland and
180 miles west of Svalbard island. It reached the area about four
hours later, and Norwegian officials said all passengers had been
picked up about three hours later.
   Soviet ships steamed to the area and took over rescue operations.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the ship carried 575 passengers,
all but about a dozen from West Germany, and 377 crew members.
   The ship set out on June 11 from Bremerhaven, West Germany,
sailed to Iceland and struck the iceberg while sailing around the
Spitsbergen island chain on its way to Norway.
   The Norwegian Meteorological Institute sends out weekly ice
charts of the area, but the situation changes too quickly to be
dependable for navigation, the Norwegian news agency reported.
   West German passenger Winfried Prince said there was no panic,
and ``the Russian crew has worked perfectly in disembarking
passengers into lifeboats, and also the Norwegians who picked us up
... have done a wonderful job.''
   About 120 Soviet crewmen stayed aboard the Maxim Gorky to keep it
from sinking. Finn B. Hansen of the North Norway Rescue Coordination
Center said the Soviet tugboat Sarja arrived with pumps and two more
Russian vessels steamed toward the ship.
   ``It looks like there is enough new pumping equipment aboard to
keep it afloat,'' Hansen said.
   A helicopter airlift from the Senja carried 73 of the oldest and
most infirm tourists from the rescue vessel to Svalbard island. They
were taken to a church, where Bjorn Sorensen, a Lutheran minister,
said some were in shock and resting.
   Arne Sinne, the rescue center spokesman, said the Senja battled
through ice as much as nine feet thick to reach the Maxim Gorky.
   The Soviet newspaper Izvestia quoted V. Kornilov of the Maritime
Fleet Ministry as saying there was fog when the ship hit the iceberg.
   ``Only the emergency team will remain on the Maxim Gorky to fight
for the life of the ship. After they arrive, the Soviet rescuers
must determine the character of the damage, the possibility of
eliminating it, and make decisions about repair,'' Izvestia said.
   The cruise ship was built in West Germany in 1969 and sold to the
Soviets in 1974.

   Hundreds of northern civil rights workers
arrived in Mississippi on Tuesday to relive _ for one day _ the
long, hot summer of 1964.
   The riders, predominantly blacks, traveled 30 hours from New York
City and Philadelphia, Pa. They came to take part in memorial
services commemorating the murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman
and Michael Schwerner on June 21, 1964.
   ``This state has a dark history and I wanted to see what
Mississippi is like,'' said Viola Sulton, 76, of Philadelphia, Pa.
   An FBI investigation revealed Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney were
killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan and their bodies were buried
in an earthen dam near Philadelphia, 40 miles north of here. The
murders occurred while the three volunteers were trying to keep
alive a voter registration drive in neighboring Neshoba County,
where Philadelphia is located.
   The crime was one of the most sensational events during the civil
rights movement of the 1960s. The killings, and subsequent coverup
by Neshoba County officials, ignited indignation around the country
and marked a dramatic and tragic beginning to the so-called
``Mississippi Freedom Summer Project,'' which brought young people
from the North pouring into Mississippi.
   Tuesday's caravan was modeled after those earlier caravans. It
was scheduled to spend the night in Meridian and go on to
Philadelphia Wednesday for a day of ceremonies marking the 25th
anniversary of the murders.
   Philadelphia Mayor Charles McClain said his town was ready for
the visitors, which were to include relatives of the victims and the
governors of Mississippi and Pennsylvania.
   ``I have to admit our people have mixed emotions about this
event,'' McClain said Tuesday while attending a Meridian luncheon
for relatives of Chaney, a native son of Mississippi and former
resident of Meridian.
   McClain added he didn't expect any trouble on Wednesday but
acknowledged that not everybody in Philadelphia, a farming community
of 7,000 residents, is happy about the memorial service.
   However, Mississippi Secretary of State Dick Molpus said state
officials hope to use the event to show the world that many positive
changes have taken place in Mississippi since the bloody summer of
1964.
   ``We intend to send a message to the nation that the only thing
burning in Mississippi today is a desire for a better life for all
our people,'' Molpus said, in an oblique reference to ``Mississippi
Burning,'' a recent, controversial movie about the murders.
   McClain, meanwhile, said he had doubts about Mississippi Attorney
General Mike Moore's statement last weekend that he might reopen a
state investigation of the 1964 murders.
   ``It could be a pretty rocky thing for our community,'' McClain
said. ``We've come 25 years and made a lot of progress and a
reopening of the murder investigation could set us back to ground
zero.''
   Ben Chaney, brother of the slain James Chaney, differed with
McClain.
   ``I think it would be good to reopen the case,'' he said Tuesday.
``An investigation might help bring out some of the terrible things
that happened in Neshoba County back then, such as the beatings at
the Mt. Zion Methodist Church shortly before the Ku Klux Klan burned
the church.''
   Wednesday's commemoration ceremonies are set to begin at the
small, predominantly black church on the outskirts of Philadelphia.
The church was rebuilt the year after it was burned by the klan.
   On the day they were killed, Schwerner and Goodman _ white
volunteers from the New York City area _ went with Chaney to Neshoba
County to visit church members and keep alive a fledgling voters
registration drive in that county. They were jailed on a traffic
charge and later turned over to a KKK mob which killed them and
buried the bodies.
   The state never did bring murder charges in the case but 19
Mississipians, most from the Meridian and Philadelphia areas, were
prosecuted under federal laws for violating the civil rights of the
three victims.
   Seven men eventually were convicted and an eighth pleaded guilty.
Their prison sentences ranged from three to 10 years prison but the
most any ever served was six years.
   The U.S. House of Representitives on Tuesday declared Wednesday
to be ``Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner Day'' in honor of the three
victims. The Senate passed an identical resolution on June 9.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Chairmen Say Old-Growth Logging A National Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three House subcommittee chairmen warned
Tuesday the fight over logging in the ancient forests of the Pacific
Northwest was more than just a regional conflict and they would keep
a close watch to ensure national interests were protected.
   The chairman of the interior subcommittee of the House
Appropriations Committee, Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., offered an
amendment to the interior appropriations bill which would have
forced the Forest Service to provide for cutting methods in all
timber sales that would result in ``minimal fragmentation'' of
remaining old-growth stands.
   The two Northwest members of the subcommittee, Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash., and Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., were caught off guard by
Yates' amendment and quickly objected.
   Yates agreed to withdraw the amendment, but said he might offer
it again when the full committee considers the bill.
   ``My intent was to protect old growth to the greatest extent
possible,'' Yates said. ``This is a national issue.''
   Meanwhile, the chairmen of two other subcommittees said during a
joint hearing that they too were concerned.
   ``Although these forests are found primarily in the Pacific
Northwest, all Americans have a stake in them,'' said Rep. Bruce
Vento, chairman of the national parks and public lands subcommittee
of the House Interior Committee.
   Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo., chairman of the forests, family farms
and energy subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee, said the
future of the old-growth forests presented tough policy questions
for lawmakers.
   ``It's of tremendous national concern and we need to make
decisions in the best interests of all our citizens,'' said Volkmer.
   Both Vento's and Volkmer's subcommittee write legislation for the
Forest Service, an arm of the Agriculture Department, while Yates'
panel provides money for the service.
   The cathedral-like forests, with trees up to 1,000 years old,
several hundred feet high and up to eight feet thick, have been the
focal point of an increasingly bitter fight between
environmentalists and the timber industry.
   Environmentalists have sought to have the spotted owl protected
as an endangered or threatened species as part of their campaign to
halt logging in the old-growth forests of the Northwest. The
industry has claimed such protection would close vast areas of the
Northwest to logging, creating an economic catastrophe.

<TEXT>
   More than 50,000 ethnic Turks have poured
across the border from Bulgaria since May to escape government
persecution, officials said Tuesday.
   Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Monday took 53 ambassadors to
the frontier and called for world condemnation of the Bulgaria's
``primitive'' policies. He urged the United Nations Security Council
to take up the issue.
   Yilmaz also said Turkey expected a clearer stand from Eastern
bloc countries, particularly the Soviet Union, on the problem.
   In 1983, Bulgaria implemented a forced assimilation campaign,
under which ethnic Turks were to change their Moslem names to
Christian Slavic ones. The campaign also barred the public use of
the Turkish language and the practice of Islamic rites.
   In May, ethnic Turks demonstrated against the campaign and police
attacked them with dogs and clubs, killing about 40 people. On May
26, Bulgaria began mass deportations of ethnic Turks they said were
leading the protests.
   Premier Turgut Ozal on Tuesday reiterated his call to Bulgaria to
open negotiations on the immigration of ethnic Turks. Bulgaria says
the Moslem minority numbers 780,000, while Turkish officials put it
at 2.5 million in the total population of 9 million.
   Ozal has proposed talks on an immigration agreement that would
allow ethnic Turks to dispose of their property and bring out liquid
assets. Deportees have said they were not allowed to take with them
more than a suitcase.
   Through defections and immigration agreements, 380,00 ethnic
Turks have come to Turkey since 1925.

<HEAD>Arkansas Congressman Won't Run Again; Blames Coelho for Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho
was ``throwing money away like crazy to get elected whip,'' leaving
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee heavily in debt, its
chairman said Tuesday.
   U.S. Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas told the Arkansas Democrat
newspaper that he inherited a $1.4 million debt from Coelho, a
former representative from California. Anthony said he then had to
borrow more money to fulfill promises Coelho had made, raising the
debt to $1.8 million.
   Anthony said that was part of the reason he was not going to seek
a third term as chairman of the committee, which he said Coelho had
turned into a political machine to which countless House Democrats
were indebted.
   ``Everybody thought Tony was the greatest thing since sliced
bread,'' said Anthony, also a Democrat. ``Yet I took over a
committee burdened with a huge debt purely and simply because Tony
Coelho was throwing money away like crazy to get elected whip. He
would give members anything they wanted in return for a commitment.''
   Telephone calls made by The Associated Press to Coelho's Virginia
office were not answered Tuesday.
   Coelho became House majority whip in 1987. He resigned recently
in the face of a likely ethics inquiry into his financial dealings.
   The committee's debt is nearly three times its reported 1987
debt. Anthony, named committee chairman in December 1986 and
re-elected without opposition in January to a second, two-year term,
said he worked until September 1987 to reduce the inherited debt.
   ``I wasn't able to start raising funds for my tenure as chairman
for nine months,'' he said. ``Still, I attempted to put things in as
positive a light as possible.''
   The debt shot back up last fall, Anthony said, because he had to
borrow more money late in the election cycle to fulfill promises to
candidates. The committee generates money for distribution to party
members seeking House seats.
   ``This committee certainly is not in worse shape than it was when
I took over,'' he said.
   Anthony also said knowledge of the debt did not hurt him in the
race to succeed Coelho as House majority whip. Anthony finished
third with 30 of 261 votes cast.
   Anthony said he has not talked about the debt in the past because
there was ``nothing to be gained at the time by pointing fingers.''
But now that Coelho is gone, ``there is no reason to keep it a big,
dark secret.''

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The nation's stock markets rallied
Tuesday despite a financial scandal that rocked trading and forced
the government's top banker to resign.
   Late in the day, a federal court rejected a prosecutor's request
for the arrest of Naji Nahas, the super-investor blamed for
upsetting the markets by bouncing $31 million in checks used to
purchase stock futures.
   Nahas has been barred from leaving the country.
   To the surprise of analysts, stock markets began to recover from
a week-long tailspin that saw share prices plunge by more than 34
percent on average.
   The Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange rose 10.5 percent on Tuesday,
the first gain since the scandal became public June 9. The Sao Paulo
market rose 15.3 percent.
   ``We're all perplexed by the rise. It's possible that the market
was so low that any trading at all would seem like a big jump,''
said Kleber Paulistano, a spokesman for the Brazilian Securities
Commission. The commission is roughly equivalent to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In Brasilia, the capital, President Jose Sarney planned to
appoint a replacement for Elmo Camoes, who quit Monday as head of
the Central Bank, Brazil's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   Camoes was forced to resign when the stock brokerage run by his
son was involved in the scandal because of speculation by Nahas.
   Paulo Cesar Ximenes, the No. 2 official at the finance ministry
and a long-time bank functionary, was expected to replace Camoes,
Central Bank spokesman Murilo Murca said.
   The center of the furor is Nahas, a 42-year-old multimillionaire
businessman and the No. 1 investor in Brazil's $30 billion stock
market.
   According to the Securities Commission, Nahas bounced checks
worth $31 million to several brokerages for the purchase of stock
futures.
   The commission said Nahas had borrowed heavily to invest in
blue-chip stocks, taking advantage of a rule that allowed him to pay
five days later. Meanwhile, he pumped up the stock's price by buying
large amounts of common stock, so the shares he received later were
worth more, it said.
   But when banks restricted credit for that type of operation,
Nahas' checks to several brokerages were returned for lack of funds.
   One of the brokerages was Capitanea Distribuidora, 99 percent
owned by Camoes.
   ``Capitanea has a large debt with Nahas. And since he's not
paying his debts, there's a risk the government will have to close
down the brokerage,'' said Paulistano, the Securities Commission
spokesman.
   ``Because he was such a big investor, brokerage houses allowed
him to run up big debts. Now all the brokerages that dealt with
Nahas are in trouble,'' Paulistano said.
   He said 29 brokerages were under investigation for irregularities.
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg. He has lots of financial
obligations that will be difficult to honor,'' Paulistano said.
   On June 12, the Commission declared a one-day stock market
holiday to prevent panic among investors. Rio de Janeiro Stock
Exchange President Sergio Barcellos sought federal help, but the
government refused to bail out the brokerages or the Rio Exchange.
   On Saturday, Barcellos announced he was taking a leave of absence
indefinitely from the presidency of the Rio Exchange.
   The Justice Ministry has barred Nahas from leaving the country.
   In Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial center, Judge Joao da Rocha
Mattos of the 12th Federal Court ruled Tuesday that Najas could not
be arrested because there was not sufficient evidence to show he was
responsible for stock manipulation.
   In his 11-page decision, Judge Mattos added Nahas had made it
clear he would cooperate with law officials and not leave the
country.
   Federal District Attorney Paulo Eduardo Bueno had requested
preventive detention of Nahas.
   Nahas, a Lebanese immigrant whose business interests range from
mining and farming to real estate and insurance, is a common sight
in Brazilian society pages. In 1984 he hosted Saudi Arabian arms
merchant Adnan Khashoggi on a visit to Brazil, when he met with
then-President Gen. Joao Figueiredo.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the United States
also has linked Nahas with Texas billionaires Nelson Bunker and
William Herbert Hunt in their ill-fated try to corner the world's
silver bullion market.
   Nahas' attorney, Murilo da Silva Freire, said Tuesday that one of
Nahas' investment companies filed for protection from creditors.
   The company, Selecta Comercio e Industria S.A., was one of
several firms owned by Nahas that operated on the stock market and
was the hardest hit by the crash.

<HEAD>`The Loman Family Picnic,' A Play by Donald Margulies, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mix Arthur Miller with Neil Simon and a bit of
Jule Styne, and you'll get ``The Loman Family Picnic'' by Donald
Margulies.
   This odd yet imaginative domestic free-for-all, which opened
Tuesday at Manhattan Theater Club's Stage II, keeps the audience
off-balance for most of the evening as the story switches from low
comedy to high drama to hard-sell musical comedy. The changes of
gear could be unsettling, but the playwright and director Barnet
Kellman manage to keep everything spinning for much of the time.
   ``On the day I was married, the world showed every sign of coming
to an end,'' says the play's 38-year-old heroine, Doris. It didn't _
and neither did her marriage to a drab lighting fixture salesman
named Herbie.
   Instead, their lives in a middle-class Coney Island apartment
building just went on and on. The years were highlighted by the
arrival of two sons, Stewie and Mitchell. The play, set in 1965,
turns on Stewie's bar mitzvah, and all the problems and pressures it
produces.
   Like Willy Loman in Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,'' Doris
dreams of a better life and actually believes she has found one with
Herbie. And like Willy, who idolized his successful and adventurous
Uncle Charlie, Doris adores her late and lamented Aunt Marsha who
died at age 23. The ghost of Uncle Charlie hovers over Miller's
classic. Aunt Marsha, a tough-talking, sexy young woman, does the
same in ``The Loman Family Picnic.''
   Doris and Herbie don't really talk. Margulies' dialogue between
husband and wife is a model of non-communication. They don't say
what's on their minds until it is too late.
   The wife focuses her attention on her sons _ the older Stewie,
played with authentic obnoxiousness by Judd Trichter, and the more
artistic and sensitive Mitchell, portrayed with charm and grace by
Michael Miceli.
   Instead of a writing a book report on ``Death of a Salesman,''
Mitchell creates a mini-musical comedy. He calls it ``Willy!'' and
it bursts upon the stage late in Act 2 after the family has had a
major blow-up over the bar mitzvah.
   Mitchell's music for ``Willy!'' is by David Shire, composer of
``Baby'' and ``Starting Here, Starting Now.'' It has the brassy,
uptempo sound of a Styne show, a style totally at odds with the
humdrum happenings on stage. But that's the point of Margulies'
family tale.
   The playwright even adds several alternate endings to the play,
imagining what the characters would like to happen and what really
does. It's funny and a bit sad at the same time.
   Marcia Jean Kurtz gives a marvelously funny and touching
performance as the mother. Doris refuses to give up or grow old.
Dressed as the Bride of Frankenstein, she goes trick or treating
with her sons on Halloween and cuts up her wedding dress for a
costume. She keeps repeating, ``I love my life, I love my life, I
love my life,'' and you believe her.
   Larry Block, one of New York's most underrated character actors,
excels as Herbie. He's a superb physical comedian and a master of
timing. Watch him as he forces himself to eat the diet tuna plate
Doris prepares each evening for him.
   Kellman has a difficult job separating the fantasies from real
life but with the help of the imaginative lighting by Debra J.
Kletter and his hardy troupe of actors, he does just that.
   Out the living room window looms a non-descript apartment
building, much like the high-rises that hem in the Loman home in
Miller's play. Designer G.W. Mercier has an eye for detail, down to
the family's hideous Mediterranean furniture and shag carpeting that
covers the tiny stage.
   ``The Loman Family Picnic'' is an unusual play. It echoes Miller,
Simon and Styne, but it can stand on its own as an original piece of
theater.

<HEAD>Executives Surrender On Charges of Defrauding Defense Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A father and son surrendered Tuesday on
charges of defrauding the Defense Department by using lower-quality
scrap metal in engine parts built into thousands of military
aircraft and tanks.
   Russell K. Baker Sr., 63, and Russell K. Baker Jr., 40, of the
Tampa area, both former presidents and general managers of Aerodyne
Investment Castings Inc., were indicted Monday. Also indicted was
Carman Eugene Alexander, 55, a former chief engineer from Converse,
Ind.
   The Bakers surrendered in Tampa and were released on $100,000
bail. Alexander was to surrender in Indianapolis, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Andrew Grosso. No court date was set.
   The federal indictment charges them with plotting to defraud the
government by using less expensive scrap instead of pure metal for
military aircraft and M-1 Abrams tank parts, then certifying that
tests showed the parts met specifications for pure alloys.
   Alexander and Baker Jr. were charged with lying to the Army about
test results for turbine blade parts and trying to hide the fact
that the blades didn't meet contract specifications.
   The government said the two falsely identified failing results on
lab reports as non-valid and omitted failed test results on
certifications to the Army.
   Baker Jr. also was charged with obstructing justice for allegedly
approving a report for the Department of Defense that contained
false and misleading information.
   The blades manufactured during a 7-year period are used on more
than 22,000 aircraft, including F-16 jets, as well as helicopters
and tanks.
   ``There also appears to be danger to personnel which is not being
adequately addressed by the Department of Defense,'' Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., told ABC News. ``I describe the military response
to this problem as being seriously inadequate, callous and probably
seriously indifferent.''
   If convicted, Alexander faces up to 40 years in prison and $1.5
million in fines; the elder Baker faces 20 years and $520,000, and
his son 45 years and $1.7 million.
   The Bakers, along with another of the elder Baker's sons, Roger,
35, were also indicted in April on 11 counts of fraud, conspiracy,
money laundering and theft against Aerodyne.
   They have pleaded innocent to the charges against the company. No
trial date has been set in that case but is expected sometime in
July.

   A wildfire apparently started by target
shooters raged through Southern California brush Tuesday, roaring to
within 1,000 feet of a desert neighborhood where 85 homes were
abandoned by fleeing residents.
   The 600-acre blaze, one of several brush fires in Ventura and San
Bernardino counties, was driven by 45 mph winds and fed on dense,
brittle vegetation as temperatures soared into the 100s.
   Firefighters were managing to keep the flames away from the Yucca
Valley homes late Tuesday. No injuries were reported and no houses
were damaged, said Deborah McClellan of the California Department of
Forestry.
   ``The fire was running in really close. The wind is causing the
firefighters problems. The evacuation was voluntary but about 85
homes were evacuated,'' McClellan said.
   The fire doubled in size in just a half hour and apparently was
started by people target shooting at utility poles, McClellan said.
   Other than the neighborhood threatened, the area 110 miles east
of Los Angeles was a sparsely populated stretch of desert skirting
the Joshua Tree National Monument. The monument was not threatened,
said McClellan.
   In Ventura County, a 300-acre brush fire was being fought by more
than 200 firefighters, and a 115-acre blaze in San Bernardino County
kept about 60 firefighters busy. No damages or injuries were
reported in those fires.

<HEAD>Four Arrested in Baby-Selling Scheme</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four people, including a father-and-daughter
attorney team, were arrested Tuesday for allegedly bilking desperate
couples of $500,000 in a baby-selling scheme that spanned 21 states
and Canada.
   The group ``preyed upon the emotions of these couples'' and ``in
effect, engaged in a black market baby-selling operation,'' said
state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   The four were named in 144-count indictment alleging they
arranged illegal adoptions for about 100 couples from around the
country. Fifty couples wound up with the infants between 1983 and
1988, Abrams said.
   An investigation disclosed that the defendants enticed
prospective parents into paying extra fees and supposed expenses of
the birth mothers, Abrams said.
   Some prospective parents paid up to $16,000 and did not receive a
child or receive their money back, Abrams said. The couples were
told the birth mothers had miscarried or changed their minds.
   The babies were found primarily through advertisements placed in
a supermarket checkout counter tabloid, and the couples who wanted
babies were found through word of mouth, officials said.
   Abrams said neither the mothers who gave up their children nor
the parents who adopted the infants face any charges.
   The four were charged with grand larceny, conspiracy, fraud,
perjury, filing false documents and making false statements. The
charges stem from the illegal operation of Child Haven of
Northeastern Pennsylvania, a private adoption agency.
   They pleaded innocent before Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Carol
Berkman.
   The most serious charge carries a maximum of seven years in
prison and a $5,000 fine or double the amount illegally gained.
Abrams said he also would seek restitution.
   Arrested were attorney Seymour Fenichel, 65; his daughter,
attorney Deborah Fenichel Greenspan, 35; Harriet Lauer, 46; and her
husband, Lawrence, 53; all of New York City.
   The elder Fenichel was released on $100,000 personal security
bond. His daughter was released on $2,500 bail. The Lauers were
released when they promised to pay $10,000 bail within two weeks.

<HEAD>Chronology Of Crackdown on Democracy Movement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of events during the
pro-democracy student demonstrations and the military crackdown on
dissent:
   April 15 _ Former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a leading
reformist, dies. Students at Beijing University put up posters
praising Hu and indirectly criticizing the opponents who forced his
resignation following student demonstrations in 1986-87.
   April 17 _ Thousands of students march in Beijing and Shanghai
shouting ``long live Hu Yaobang, long live democracy, long live
freedom, long live the rule of law.''
   April 18 _ 2,000 students from Beijing bicycle into Tiananmen
Square and protest before the Great Hall of the People. Their
demands include repudiation of official campaigns against press
freedom and other democratic reforms. They also want top leaders to
reassess Hu.
   April 21 _ Crowds of up to 100,000 gather in Tiananmen Square to
mourn Hu.
   April 22 _ Students defy police orders to leave the square.
Official memorial ceremonies are held for Hu at the Great Hall of
the People. Riots break out in the provincial capitals of Xian and
Changsha.
   April 23 _ Beijing students announce a class boycott to demand
democracy.
   April 24 _ Tens of thousands of students at Beijing universities
go on strike, demanding dialogue with the government.
   April 27 _ More than 150,000 students, with wide support, surge
past police lines and fill Tiananmen Square, chanting slogans for
democracy and freedom.
   April 29 _ Government officials meet with student leaders, but
independent student groups say they will continue a class boycott at
41 university campuses in Beijing.
   May 2 _ 6,000 students march in Shanghai.
   May 4 _ 100,000 students and supporters march on Tiananmen square
to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China's first student movement.
Also demonstrations in Shanghai, Nanjing and other cities. 300
journalists protest outside the official Xinhua News Agency.
   May 9 _ Journalists petition the government for press freedom.
   May 13 _ 2,000 students begin hunger strike in Tiananmen Square.
   May 15 _ Government deadline for students to leave the square
comes and goes. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's welcoming ceremony
moved to the airport.
   May 16 _ Hundreds of thousands occupy the square.
   May 18 _ 1 million people march in support of the hunger
strikers. Li Peng issues a stern warning to student leaders and
refuses to discuss their demands.
   May 19 _ A tearful Zhao makes a pre-dawn visit to weakened hunger
strikers. Li also visits the students briefly. In the evening the
students decide to end the hunger strike, but quickly change their
mind when Li and President Yang Shangkun announce martial law. Zhao
reportedly resigns or is ousted from power after failing to convince
Li and others to compromise.
   May 28 _ About 80,000 people, many students from outside the
capital, demonstrate but unlike past rallies few workers participate.
   May 30 _ Students unveil their ``Goddess of Democracy,'' a
replica of the Statue of Liberty, on the square. The government
calls it an insult to the nation.
   May 31 _ Farmers and workers stage the first of several
pro-government rallies in Beijing suburbs.
   June 1 _ The Beijing Municipal Government bans all foreign press
coverage of the demonstrations.
   June 3 _ Tens of thousands of troops advance on the city shortly
after midnight, but are repulsed by residents who put up barricades.
In the afternoon, 5,000 troops appear outside the Great Hall of the
People but are again surrounded and stopped. In the final assault,
that evening troops shoot and beat their way to the square.
   June 4 _ Troops occupy the square and smash the Goddess of
Democracy with tanks. The shooting continues with soldiers
periodically firing on crowds gathered on the outskirts of the
square. Residents set fire to more than 100 military trucks and
armored personnel carriers. The government claims the
``counterrevolutionary riots'' have been suppressed. Riots break out
in southwestern Chengdu.
   June 5 _ Reports of clashes between rival military groups around
Beijing. President Bush condemns the ``bloody and violent''
crackdown and orders a suspension of U.S. military sales and
contacts.
   June 6 _ Foreign embassies advise their nationals to leave China.
The government says 300 people were killed and 7,000 injured in the
crackdown, but claims most of the dead were soldiers. More reports
of clashes between military units. Six killed in Shanghai when a
train runs through a barricade. The U.S. State Department announces
that dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife have sought refuge in the
U.S. Embassy.
   June 7 _ Troops responding to what they say is sniper fire shoot
into a foreign diplomatic compound. The United States and other
governments order the mandatory evacuation of dependents of
diplomatic personnel.
   June 8 _ Premier Li Peng appears in public for the first time
since the crackdown to congratulate troops.
   June 9 _ Senior leader Deng Xiaoping appears for the first time
since May 16. In a speech to military officers he blames the turmoil

   June 18 _ Politburo member Qiao Shi appears prominently in the
official media, adding to speculation the party security man will
replace Zhao.

Atwater's highly partisan remarks to the nation's mayors have
touched off criticism and dismay from elected city leaders of both
parties.
   ``I was embarrassed and disappointed,'' said Republican Mayor
Bill Hudnut of Indianapolis, following Atwater's remarks to the U.S.
Conference of Mayors on Monday.
   ``It was insulting to me and I think it was the most insensitive
speech I've ever heard,'' said Democratic Mayor Wilson Goode of
Philadelphia.
   Atwater used his appearance to declare the national Republican
Party would work actively for Republican mayoral candidates in New
York and elsewhere, and would seek to recruit ``a half dozen to a

   U.S. industrial plants are spewing 360 million
pounds of suspected cancer-causing chemicals into the air annually
with releases from each of the 30 biggest polluters exceeding 1
million pounds, according to government statistics.
   The pollution figures were released Monday by a private
environmental group and confirmed by the Environmental Protection
Agency, which provided the raw statistics based on information
provided by industry under a fledgling public disclosure law.
   ``Industries are using the sky as a garbage dump to dispose of
hundreds of millions of pounds of unregulated cancer-causing
chemicals,'' said Deborah Sheiman, author of the report from the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
   The NRDC identified more than 1,500 companies in 46 states that
release substantial amounts of at least one of 13 cancer-causing
chemicals into the air. Thirty of the companies reported releasing
more than 1 million pounds of a particular carcinogen and several
had releases five to nine times that amount, the group said.

   Oliver L. North should go to prison because he
broke the law during the Iran-Contra scandal, lied about it during
his trial and still doesn't show ``one iota of remorse,''
prosecutors say.
   In a sentencing memo likening the fired White House aide to the
corrupt politicians of Tammany Hall, prosecutors say North ``viewed
and continues to view himself as being above the law and beyond
reproach.''
   The former National Security Council aide faces a possible
10-year term when sentenced Friday by U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell for destroying evidence, aiding and abetting the obstruction
of Congress and accepting an illegal gratuity.
   Letting North go without a prison term ``would be a statement
that 15 years after Watergate, government officials can participate
in a brazen cover-up, lie to Congress and collect a substantial
gratuity and still receive only a slap on the wrist,'' prosecutors
told Gesell in their memo Monday.

   The nation's private employers now have
expanded authority to require drug tests of job applicants, while
railroads and airlines have greater power to test those already on
the job.
   The National Labor Relations Board says private employers may
decide unilaterally to require drug testing of job applicants,
although they still must negotiate with unions if they want to test
their employees,
   The board's decision came Monday, the same day the Supreme Court
ruled in a more narrowly defined case that railroads may require
tests for workers without first bargaining with unions.
   The decisions regarding existing workers appeared at odds, but
they involved two separate labor laws, the Railway Labor Act that
applies only to rail and airline workers, and the National Labor
Relations Act which governs other labor contracts.

   The Voyager 2 spacecraft has discovered a
6,200-mile-wide dark spot on Neptune, and scientists believe it's a
giant storm similar to Earth's hurricanes and Jupiter's Great Red
Spot.
   The width is about one-fifth of Neptune's 30,700-mile diameter,
just as the 16,000-mile-wide Great Red Spot is about one-fifth the
size of Jupiter, said Andrew Ingersoll, a planetary scientist at the
California Institute of Technology.
   Voyager 2 was launched from Cape Canaveral in 1977, visited
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Its twin,
Voyager 1, explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, and is now
heading toward interplanetary space.
   ``I had gotten sort of discouraged from the Uranus encounter
because Uranus was such a bland place,'' Ingersoll said Monday. ``So
I'm happy to see such action on Neptune.''

<TEXT>
   After years of sitting back and waiting for 90
percent of the television audience to automatically tune in to their
new fall shows, the networks have had a rude awakening.
   The audiences, faced with an ever-increasing number of
entertainment choices, aren't automatically tuning in. The networks
now have to work to win them over, and that has spawned an
unprecedented burst of promotional innovation for the 1989-90 season.
   Come fall, folks stopping in for a pizza will also receive an ABC
promo tape. Shoppers can buy a blank Scotch videotape and get an NBC
featurette, visit K mart and be greeted by CBS displays, go to a
movie and see a commercial for ABC. Demonstrator television sets in
Sears stores will be tuned to NBC, and Maxell tape packages will
include pitches for CBS.
   Last season, the three-network share of the television audience
dropped to 67 percent, from 71 percent the previous season. Those
A.C. Nielsen Co. figures reflect inroads by cable, independent
channels and videocassette rentals in the last decade that have
eroded the networks' traditional combined share that ranged up to 90
percent in the 1970s.
   This summer and fall, the networks' promotional ploys range from
look-alike ``news'' reports on upcoming shows to marketing tie-ins
with retail outlets and videotape manufacturers _ on the assumption
that viewers will buy the tapes to record the network's shows.
   Mark Zakarin, vice president for marketing for ABC Entertainment,
calls the new network strategy ``guerrilla marketing.''
   ``These used to be easy jobs,'' he said. ``Used to be all you had
to do was do your own on-air advertising and plunk an ad in TV Guide
a couple of times.
   ``As our audience fragments,'' said Zakarin, ``we gotta go out
and find them wherever they are.''
   ABC plans to take out ads in TV Guide again this fall _ with a
difference. During the month of November _ when important local
affiliate ratings are measured _ ABC's ads will include bar codes,
similar to product price codes. The codes can be read by programming
``wands'' included with some Panasonic videocassette recorders. Run
the wand over the bar code in the ad for, say, ``thirtysomething,''
and the machine is programmed to record it. ABC figures there are
800,000 such VCRs in viewers' homes.
   CBS previously announced a promotional partnership with K mart
Corp., and NBC followed suit with Sears, Roebuck and Co. ABC is
still looking for a retail partner, but has other promotional plans,
including the first-ever network commercial in movie theaters _ a
60-second promo for its fall lineup that will begin running in 5,000
theaters in August.
   CBS plans to run on its own airwaves ``CBS Spotlites,''
advertisements designed to resemble news breaks, that feature
reports on stars of upcoming CBS shows.
   All three networks have cross-promotions involving videotapes.
   CBS has joined Maxell in a marketing strategy that will include a
plug for Maxell in CBS' fall print advertising. A circular promoting
CBS shows will be included in Maxell videotape packages.
   ``This is our way of pointing out to viewers that they need not
miss any CBS programs _ they can tape them on Maxell,'' said CBS
Vice President George Schweitzer.
   But purchasers of 3M-Scotch videotapes will get a pitch to record
NBC shows. Purchasers of five-packs of Scotch videocassettes will
receive a one-hour, NBC-produced promotional video, ``Behind the
Scenes at America's Favorite Network.'' A coupon in single-cassette
packages will offer the video for $5.95. Scotch packages will also
include a printed insert promoting NBC's fall schedule.
   ABC is participating in a promotional video distribution that
also involves HBO and Paramount productions. One million promotional
videos will be handed out to Pizza Hut customers.
   CBS and NBC's retailer tie-ins, meanwhile, involve
cross-promotion in print and television ads, plus in-store displays
enticing shoppers to enter contests with prizes of cars, video
equipment, vacations _ even, in NBC's case, a guest shot on a
prime-time show.
   Stay tuned. Come the fall, the networks will find out if anyone's
buying.

<HEAD>The Terrors of A Modern Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 20 months since the stock market crash of
October 1987 the American economy and the workers, investors,
managers and others who contribute to it have been repeatedly
terrorized.
   No individual will admit to being the terrorist, and no culprit
has been jailed, but there has indeed been a reign of terror. As one
threat passes, another takes its place. Always a test, never a rest.
   The first of the threats flashed across America within minutes of
the crash. America, it was said, was about to plunge into recession.
Not just an ordinary one, but something that would make the 1930s
seem like boom times.
   It sounded convincing. A trillion dollars or more of value cannot
disappear without repercussions; consumers, who make up two-thirds
of the economy, will be unable to buy; producers without buyers will
be forced to shut down.
   Learned journals prepared articles on the amazing similarities
between 1987 and 1929. Popular essays spread and enforced the gloom.
Prophets orated from the mountaintops. Seers claimed to have looked
into the pit.
   Time passed, and people adjusted to fear. They conceded that
judgment day might be postponed, but in the meantime there would be
terrible times. The economy would overheat! Interest rates would
rise! Inflation was on the way!
   That threat seemed good for a few months; there was enough
supporting evidence to convince the ``experts'' that this time they
were onto something substantial. Inflation now, they said, and then
the economic crash.
   Whether it was through the intervention of divine power or the
Federal Reserve, or because the threat wasn't real to begin with,
the economy escaped the wild inflation that had been foreseen. And
maybe even the crash.
   Whatever, the old fear eroded into a new thesis: This economy has
some guts after all, it was said. We will have a soft landing; the
economy will parachute back to reality rather than crash in ruins.
   It could not be, said others. When has an economy that has risen
for so many months with so many aberrations _ the federal deficit
and the imbalance of international payments, for example _ come down
to a soft landing?
   Soft landings, it was said by erudite ecomomic watchers, are for
astronauts, not economies. Space ships are controlled vehicles,
economies are nothing but meteors racing through space under no
human control whatever.
   Meanwhile, another threat emerged: Stagflation. If by chance the
economy came down like a feather instead of a rock it wouldn't be
able to rise again. It would stagflate; prices would rise, but jobs
and payrolls would shrink.
   So accustomed were people to threats that they almost failed to
observe that one by one the threats were evaporating like steam on a
dry day. A fragile thread of optimism even wove its way through the
economy. The economy, it was said, is reaccelerating.
   Reaccelerate? When? You mean, grow again? Impossible! Why we
haven't had our great recession yet. Punishment first, and then
acceleration, perhaps, but not before.
   Terrorism in pursuit of goals generally ignores everything,
including the facts, but it also seizes opportunity. And if the
reacceleration theory had to be accepted by the terrorists then they
would make use of it.
   They are reminding us now that the economy is cyclical, that ups
are followed by downs, and that whenever the economy accelerates it
is heading for a fall.

   Anne Frank turned 13 on June 12, 1942. She
received a blue blouse, roses, a bottle of slightly fermented grape
juice, a party game, a plant, a dish of sticky molasses, a bowl of
truffles and a homemade strawberry tart.
   She was also given a squarish book, commonly used to collect
autographs, with a red and white checked cover. Anne began keeping a
diary.
   What began as an adolescent's longing for self-knowledge evolved
into a lasting document about the destruction of human life, the
tragic loss of innocence and unfathomable hatred of the Holocaust.
   Forced into hiding by the Nazis, Anne chronicled her days with
uncommon humor, perceptiveness and faith in the goodness of people.
``The Diary of Anne Frank'' stands as a moving, tangible document,
and has sold millions of copies around the world.
   Anne died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, and
would have been 60 this year. A critical edition of her diary has
been released in the United States by Doubleday.
   A popular student at a Jewish school in Amsterdam, Anne Frank was
a pretty, dark-haired girl, outspoken in class and admired by many
boys. Yet the diary would prove to be her most cherished friend.

friends, anxious to catch a glimpse of me and who, failing that,
peep at me through mirrors in class. I have relations, aunts and
uncles, who are darlings too, a good home, no _ I don't seem to lack
anything.
   ``But it's the same with all my friends, just fun and joking,
nothing more. ... We don't seem to be able to get any closer. .. .
Perhaps I lack confidence, but anyway, there it is, a stubborn fact
and I don't seem to be able to do anything about it.''

   While hiding from the Nazis, Anne was transformed from a playful
girl of 13 to an insightful, compassionate, even spiritual
15-year-old. On Jan. 6, 1944, she recalled a dream about a boy from
school:
   ``I awoke at this point, while I could still feel his cheek
against mine and felt his brown eyes looking deep into my heart, so
deep, that here he read how much I loved him and how much I still
love him. Tears sprang into my eyes once more, and I was very sad
that I had lost him again. ...''
   In another dream, she saw her late grandmother and a friend from
school.
   ``... Granny appeared as a guardian angel; then followed Hanneli,
who seems to be a symbol to me of all the sufferings of all my
girlfriends and all Jews. When I pray for her, I pray for all Jews
and all those in need. ...''
   Prepared by the Netherlands State Institute for War
Documentation, the book includes essays on the Franks before and
after they went into hiding, the events surrounding their capture,
and how the diary reached publication.
   The new edition contains three versions of the diary: Anne's
first and second drafts, and the original published work, which
combines the two.
   But commemorating her birth was not the only reason for the
reissue. The book also offers a strong rebuttal to accusations made
over the years that the diary was fake, a shameless exploitation.
   In the late 1950s, right-wing newspapers in Austria and Norway
published attacks on the diary, insisting the ideas expressed were
far too sophisticated for a teen-age girl. In the mid-'70s, a German
publishing house began distributing pamphlets repeating charges that
Otto Frank, Anne's father, had written the diary with the help of a
New York playwright.
   Upon Frank's death in 1980, the original manuscripts were turned
over to the Netherlands war documentation institute; work on the
critical edition began the following year. One of the book's
editors, Gerrold van der Stroom, insisted in a recent interview that
the diary is indeed authentic.
   ``We asked the Dutch forensic laboratory of the Ministry of
Justice, which does the same work for police, to check the paper and
ink. They found that all the paper and all the ink, were very common
for the first half of the 1940s,'' he said.
   ``They also compared the letters before the war, postcards, etc.,
that she had written to her grandmother in Switzerland, with the
handwriting in the diaries. They found that the same person wrote
everything.''
   The Franks lived in Frankfurt, Germany, until 1933 when they
emigrated to Amsterdam after Hitler took power. The Nazis occupied
the Netherlands in 1940, and began imposing ever harsher anti-Jewish
laws, forcing Jews to wear a yellow six-pointed star.
   When the SS, the Nazi military police, issued a call-up notice to
Frank in July 1942, the family was forced into hiding. For more than
two years, the Franks and four others were holed up in a ``Secret
Annexe,'' located upstairs from Frank's warehouse in Amsterdam.
   They relied on friends, notably Miep and Jan Gies, to bring them
food and supplies, and prayed that the Allied troops would liberate
their country before the Nazis could find them.
   Police raided the annex on Aug. 4, 1944, and the prisoners were
sent off to Westerbork, a Jewish transit camp. Anne and her sister,
Margot, were later shipped to the notorious death camp, Auschwitz,
and eventually to Bergen-Belsen, where they contracted typhoid fever
and perished within days of each other in the winter of 1945. Their
mother died at another camp.
   After the arrest, Miep Gies gathered up Anne's papers and kept
them under lock and key. When Frank returned to Amsterdam in June
1945, he headed straight for the Gies home and was presented with
his daughter's journals.

   ``I see the eight of us with our `Secret Annexe' as if we were a
little piece of blue heaven, surrounded by heavy black rain
clouds,'' Anne Frank wrote on Nov. 8, 1943.
   ``The round, clearly defined spot where we stand is safe, but the
clouds gather more closely about us and the circle which separates
us from the approaching danger closes more and more tightly.''

   In 1947, a Dutch edition of the diary was published to
overwhelming acclaim. The book has since been printed in more than
30 countries, including West Germany, Finland, Spain, Argentina,
Iceland and Japan.

   Gilberto Campos was alarmed when he
found his sons sniffing green rocks that kids carried away from the
municipal dump.
   Fourteen-year-old Luis and 18-year-old Jose lurched and stumbled
in the unpaved streets, occasionally pulling a sock out of a pocket
and sniffing it. The socks held a bright green, rocky substance that
smelled like airplane glue or spray paint. When crushed and sniffed,
it gave the same cheap highs.
   The rocks surfaced in March and quickly became the drug of choice
around the vast dump, an area where the well-off live in cinderblock
houses and others make do with cardboard huts. Young children
flocked to it, according to dozens of worried parents interviewed by
Juarez newspapers.
   ``It makes people stupid and aggressive _ more aggressive than a
drunk,'' said the Campos, whose sons shoved and hit him when he
confronted them. They ``would lie on the couch and wouldn't get up.''
   The green rocks proved to be toxic waste dumped by a
``maquiladora,'' one of 275 U.S.-owned factories located in Juarez
to take advantage of cheap labor. Mexican environmental suspect
maquiladoras improperly dispose of half their hazardous waste. That
would be hundreds of tons a year in Juarez alone.
   The officials in Juarez say they have gotten rid of the green
rocks and cracked down on toxic wastes at the dump, but gangs of
toughs known as ``cholos'' still collect and sell intoxicating
substances.
   Campos didn't know any of that in late March when he took some of
the rocks to a reform school principal. She didn't know what they
were.
   About the same time, a woman walked into the Centro de
Integracion Juvenil, a drug treatment center for children, and told
psychologist Raul Bueno that her 10-year-old son was sniffing green
rocks. ``She said that at the dump, there were lots of other
children who used this.''
   Bueno, who estimates that about 200 children experimented with
the substance, sent it to the Secretariat Urban Development and
Ecology, or SEDUE _ the beleaguered equivalent of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
   SEDUE identified it as solidified Kaltex, an industrial solvent
containing toluene, a petroleum derivative that can cause lung
damage.
   A doctor told Campos him the Kaltex did more than that to his
sons. ``When they get married, they can't have children,'' Campos
said.
   Infertility is one possible side effect when adolescents use
inhalants like toluene, said Dr. Antonio Carrasco of the La Fe
family clinic in south El Paso, where inhalant abuse is widespread.
If users don't become infertile, their children are likely to be
deformed.
   Inhalants harm the liver and kidneys and can cause organic brain
syndrome _ characterized by loss of coordination, irritability,
chronic confusion and nerve injury, Carrasco said. And they can
destroy tear ducts.
   ``After a while, they can't even cry, and they're subject to eye
infections,'' he said. ``I think inhalant abuse is one of the worst
_ and it's one of the most available for young kids.''
   Parents reported seeing cholos jumping onto trucks turning off
Avenue of the Aztecs onto the dirt road leading to the dump. The
cholos would toss five-, 10- and 20-gallon plastic buckets of waste
off to sell. When SEDUE officials inspected the dump April 6, they
found dozens of buckets of Kaltex.
   Campos, who kept several chunks of Kaltex as souvenirs, said a
piece the size of his foot goes for 10,000 pesos _ about $4.35.
   In late April, SEDUE traced the Kaltex to Outboard Marine de
Mexico, which makes parts for Johnson and Evinrude outboard boat
engines.
   Officials at the Waukegan, Wis.-based manufacturer referred all
questions to Tim Anklam, manufacturing engineer in the Juarez plant.
   Anklam said news reports about the solvent residue had been
greatly exaggerated and that representatives from the factory and
SEDUE scoured the dump in late April and found three five-gallon
plastic buckets that had originated at Outboard Marine de Mexico,
called Omex for short.
   ``Omex accepts the possibility that the three pails ... could
have been dumped by accident at the Juarez landfill. It was just a
human error, if in fact it is ours. A lot of companies use similar
materials around here,'' said Anklam, adding that Omex is
cooperating with SEDUE and acting legally.
   Mexican law requires hazardous waste from maquiladoras to be
returned to their place of origin, usually the United States. U.S.
law requires companies returning hazardous waste to Texas to notify
the Texas Water Commission, which shares information with the EPA.
   But Roger Meacham, EPA spokesman in Dallas, said tracking waste
through paperwork is time-consuming _ and even if the EPA had no
record of a company returning waste to the United States, it
wouldn't mean much.
   ``If the wastes are from raw materials from Mexico, they can be
disposed of in Mexico,'' he said. ``Or if it's recyclable, it can be
recycled in Mexico. Or they can store their waste on-site in Mexico
indefinitely.''
   Rosa Manuela Salas, chief of SEDUE's office in Juarez, said Omex
is complying with Mexican law. She referred all other questions to
Carlos James, communications chief for SEDUE. James did not return
numerous calls to his home and office from The Associated Press.
   Ms. Salas told the newspaper Diario de Juarez that Omex was the
first maquiladora to be caught throwing toxic waste into the Juarez
dump. ``To ensure this doesn't happen again, we're giving an
identification number to each business that generates waste, to make
it easier to watch them.''
   But it is difficult for SEDUE to keep watch. The agency has 10
inspectors in Juarez to monitor 275 maquiladoras and at least 100
Mexican-owned factories. Faced with a crushing national debt, a
severe housing shortage and a population boom that adds 1 million
people to the work force a year, Mexico's government has not been
able to make environmental protection a high priority.
   So far, SEDUE's plan doesn't seem to be working. Luis Hernandez,
the dump's foreman, said he doesn't know what's in the scores of
trucks that deposit waste in the landfill daily. Neither do the
drivers, he said.
   But the cholos seem to know. They still wait at the corner where
trucks turn to go to the dump. They still jump on, and they still
toss buckets off the speeding trucks for collection later.
   Luis Campos takes part.
   ``There are 10 other kinds of intoxicants there,'' Gilberto
Campos said. ``Paint, adhesive ....''
   He shrugged helplessly, lowered his gaze, and sighed.

   ``Stealing Home'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
PG-13.)
   
   ``Stealing Home,'' with its baseball underpinnings, is a sweet
little tale of coming-of-age in middle-class America, a place with
proms and summer at the beach.
   It's good stuff for a family Saturday night viewing, but you
might need a bit of parental guidance for the younger set.
   Mark Harmon stars as the would-be baseball hero and Jodie Foster
as a free spirit who commits suicide. She was his baby sitter as a
child and sometime lover as a young adult.
   But there are two major problems with the film.
   The first is that Foster's character, Katy Chandler, never really
gets a chance to develop. We see far too little of her in the movie
to really understand her motivation and direction or to explain her
suicide.
   The other problem is the overwhelming use of flashbacks. The
whole thing is a flashback, with flashbacks inside the flashback,
which really jumbles the timing.
   The story unwinds through Harmon, who daydreams as he sits on a
minor league bench. Harmon, as Billy, the charming all-American kid,
does a neat job of coming back from a ne'er-do-well to cleancut
baseball player after he returns home to dispose of Katy's ashes.
   The daydream proceeds through the odyssey of growing up and, of
course, the greatest of all youthful experiences _ stealing home
from third base.

   ``Torch Song Trilogy'' (RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video.
VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R.)
   
   ``There are easier things in life,'' says Arnold, as he sits at
his dressing table making up to perform as Virginia Hamm, ``than
being a drag queen. But you see, I ain't got no choice. ... I can't
walk in flats.''
   And, throughout ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' it's clear there are
easier things than living openly as a homosexual who demands the
love and respect of the people he loves.
   But Arnold Beckoff (Harvey Fierstein) persists, and his joys and
sorrows make a funny and moving film, adapted from the Broadway play
for which Fierstein received acting and writing Tony awards.
   As Arnold searches for domestic happiness, first with a bisexual
teacher (Brian Kerwin) who cannot commit, then with a young model
(Matthew Broderick) who is only too happy to do so, it becomes clear
his toughest challenge is his mother.
   Arnold performs at Club East 4th, a good-natured club of female
impersonators who act as surrogate family to one another in pre-AIDS
New York. He hopes for a spouse and to adopt a child.
   Fierstein does not avoid or minimize the pain Arnold causes his
parents or the pain they cause him.
   ``It kills me to think they look at me and wonder what they did
wrong,'' he says one day to his brother. ``You call this a life, I
call it a sickness,'' his mother (Anne Bancroft) screams at one
point.
   Arnold is streetwise and vulnerable, and Fierstein is capable of
an amazing range of facial expression. His performance is moving and
endearing. Broderick and Bancroft also are excellent, directed by
Paul Bogart.

   ``Daffy Duck's Quackbusters'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta,
$19.98.)
   
   Adult Merrie Melodies mavens will be disappointed by ``Daffy
Duck's Quackbusters,'' a newly animated feature-length video that
strings together snippets of old Daffy classics with newer material
meant to be a send-up of ``Ghostbusters.''
   This formula is already familiar on television, as Bugs Bunny
Christmas or Thanksgiving shows or the like.
   But the sad result is that you have cartoon classics, with their
sophisticated wit and superior animation and voice characterization,
patched together by fair-to-middling new animation.
   The satiric bite that made Warner Bros. cartoons fun for all ages
is now largely missing. ``Daffy Duck's Quackbusters'' is OK for the
kids, but for adults there are certainly better video anthologies
around.
   Even more sadly, what everyone will notice is that Daffy just
doesn't sound like his zany self. Nor do the other characters like
Porky and Bugs. The great Mel Blanc, who has been the voice of
nearly all the Warner Bros. cartoon characters for some 50 years, is
now 80.
   Unfortunately, this 1980s vintage Daffy seems like the pug who
didn't know when to hang up the gloves.

   ``Flowers in the Dirt'' (Capitol) _ Paul McCartney
   
   Paul McCartney's ``Flowers in the Dirt'' contains some of his
best work in more than 15 years, although it falls naggingly short
of being an unqualified success.
   Spurred by ex-mate George Harrison's triumphant comeback and his
own flagging reputation, McCartney pulled out all stops to show he's
no fool over the hill.
   The single ``My Brave Face,'' co-written with Elvis Costello, is
easily McCartney's best tune of the 1980s. It's a bracing melody
about the sudden onset of bachelorhood, where it quickly becomes
clear that the narrator's joy over new-found freedom is only a
facade for a sense of loss. The tune is, yes, Beatlesque, but is odd
enough to be distinctive.
   ``This One,'' a gentle melody about finding the right time to
tell someone you love them, and ``We Got Married'' are typical of
McCartney's sweet side. This time, though, they're not sickly sweet.
The heavily produced ``Rough Ride'' also works well.
   McCartney pokes fun at his image with ``You Want Her Too,'' a
biting duet with Costello that's the antithesis of Paul's cloying
``The Girl Is Mine'' with Michael Jackson. The comparison with
McCartney's duets with John Lennon is also obvious.
   Costello helps, but McCartney seems driven to abandon his insipid
lyrics for adult themes. ``We Got Married'' looks at the institution
several years removed from the initial excitement, while
``Distractions'' shows how other forces impinge on happiness.
   That's a good head start for a solid album. But then Paul makes a
few strategic errors.
   Songs such as ``Motor of Love'' and ``How Many People'' are the
type of innocuous filler that all but the truly classic albums
contain. But McCartney stretches these songs to stupefying lengths _
more than six minutes for ``Motor'' _ turning them into unpleasant
experiences. It's a surprising lack of discipline for someone who
should know better.
   Paul also spoils ``Don't Be Careless Love'' by stretching his
voice to unreasonably high levels.
   Still, this is far richer album than any by McCartney since
``Band on the Run'' back in 1973. It's good to have him back.

   Keyboard Sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti (London) _ Andras Schiff,
piano.
   
   Scarlatti was born in one of music's all-time great years: 1685,
when Bach and Handel also joined the world. In 1729, the Italian
Scarlatti moved to Spain and spent the rest of his life working for
the royal court there. It was mainly during those years that he
wrote his 555 keyboard sonatas.
   What an abundance of music. Imagine, you could listen to one a
day for 18 months, or London could issue another 40 CDs of Scarlatti
sonatas. These mostly one-movement pieces are gems. Typically, what
makes them so unique are particular transcendant moments _ a chord
here, a two-bar phrase there, even a simple grace note.
   It is music of color: strumming guitars, bagpipe drones, clicking
castanets. Such a quality makes these sonatas particularly apt for
piano, rather than their original harpsichord medium.
   Andras Schiff uses the instrument to add color, yet keeps a light
harpsichord quality that doesn't turn the music into 19th century
romance.
   His technically superb playing is clear, but not luminous. In the
more reflective sonatas, it becomes even a little bland. He does
better in the livelier selections. Schiff holds the music up for
your contemplation rather than drawing you in.
   The choice of 15 sonatas is good, and generous at 73 minutes, 14
seconds.

Cullinet Software Inc. for about $320 million in stock.
   The deal announced Monday would unite the first billion-dollar
software company with a former No. 1, Cullinet, which has not made
an annual profit since 1986.
   Analysts said they expect Computer Associates to follow its
tradition of slashing jobs at new acquisitions.

annually at least 1 million pounds each of chemicals suspected of
causing cancer, according to federal figures disclosed by a private

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in three
weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 8.22 percent, up from 8.13 percent last
week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 8.08 percent, up from 7.79 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since May 30, when three-month bills
sold for 8.5 percent and six-month bills averaged 8.36 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors

   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the

<HEAD>NCube Claims World's Fastest Computer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NCube has unveiled what it claimed is the world's
fastest computer, a machine that can harness more than 8,000
processors to a single task and carry out 27 billion operations per
second.
   The raw speed of computers is tricky to compare because the
performance of a machine depends on its software and the work it is
given. But NCube helped its credibility by announcing Monday its new
computer, NCube 2, would run Unix System V, a widely used type of
base-layer software.
   NCube, a privately owned company based in Beaverton, Ore., also
announced its new machine will run Oracle Corp.'s data-base
management software, which is used by businesses for storing and
retrieving electronic records.
   The ability to run Oracle could help set NCube apart from its
rivals, said Michael Burwen, president of Palo Alto Management Group.
   ``Ordinarily the architecture of a supercomputer is pointed to
doing number-crunching kinds of things, rather than the kinds of
things you need to do for data-base retrieval,'' Burwen said.
   He said other supercomputer makers, including Cray Research Inc.,
are working with Oracle on versions of its data-base software
capable of running on their machines.
   ``It's probably going to be important to NCube. They're one of
these companies that's had a solution looking for a market,'' Burwen
said.
   NCube said first shipments were scheduled for July. Prices will
start at $495,000.
   The company was founded in 1983 and shipped its first computer in
1985.

political and social programs are so vast and impersonal as to be
beyond effective control.''
   But he said, ``attitudes and decisions of leaders like yourselves
do make a profound difference for good or ill in shaping the future
of humanity. I am confident ... that you will not fail to be
compassionate as well as responsible.''

   Colgate-Palmolive Co. says it will buy back $410
million worth of its shares, or approximately 2 percent of
outstanding stock, and expand its employee stock ownership plan.
   The consumer product company's shares closed up $1 a share at
$50.87{ in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday.
   Colgate said Monday the moves would increase the value of its
stock. However, many companies, even those not facing takeover
threats, have been buying their own stock and setting up or
expanding employee stock plans recently, in part because of their
value as takeover defenses.
   With fewer shares on the market, a company is less vulnerable to
a takeover threat. Furthermore, employees who hold stock in a
company are considered more likely than other shareholders to to
side with management in a takeover fight.

<HEAD>Eastern Plans New Expansion; Pilots Skeptical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikebound Eastern Airlines says that by Aug. 1 it
will offer five times as many flights as currently scheduled, but
striking pilots were skeptical of the plan.
   Eastern, whose operations were virtually grounded by the walkout
that started March 4, is flying only 79 flights daily. It said
Monday it plans to increase that number to 226 by July 2 and 390 by
Aug. 1.
   The strike by the Machinists union, which has been supported by
pilots and flight attendants, forced Eastern to seek bankruptcy
protection from creditors on March 9.
   ``We're on target with the buildup outlined in our April business
plan,'' said George Brennan, Eastern's vice president of marketing.
``By August we'll be at mid-point with the addition of 21 new
cities.''
   In April, Eastern's management proposed a plan to rebuild as a
carrier about two-thirds its original size and to sell about $1.8
billion in assets to pay off debts. The plan still must be approved
by federal bankruptcy court and a committee representing Eastern's
major creditors.
   Hank Weber, a spokesman for the pilots union, said Eastern does
not have enough newly hired pilots to support even the July 2 level
of 226 flights.
   ``We're just a little bit skeptical,'' Weber said. ``They'll need
400 pilots and they simply haven't got them.''
   He said the carrier would need at least 800 pilots to reach the
Aug. 1 levels but has only 350.
   Eastern could reach the July 2 level for a few days by mobilizing
all management and training pilots, but the company could not
sustain that number of flights, Weber said.
   Eastern said it will increase the number of cities it serves from
27 now to 49 on July 2 and and 70 on Aug. 1.
   Before the strike, Miami-based Eastern, a subsidiary of Texas Air
Corp. of Houston, served 118 cities with 1,040 flights daily.

<HEAD>Wilkinson Sword Responds to Gillette Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wilkinson Sword Inc. has taken a swipe at
Gillette Co. in an escalation of their legal wrangle over razor
blade claims.
   Gillette accused Wilkinson Sword in a suit filed last month in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan of falsely advertising its new
Ultra Glide razor as the ``smoothest, most comfortable shave known
to man.''
   On Monday, Wilkinson Sword filed legal papers in which it
defended its advertising, asked that the suit be dismissed and
accused Gillette of false advertising for calling its Atra Plus
shavers ``The best a man can get.''
   Wilkinson Sword also said Gillette was using monopolistic
practices in suing Wilkinson and ``attempting to intercede'' with
the television networks and independent stations to prevent
Wilkinson from running its commercials.
   Atlanta-based Wilkinson began running ads on May 22 that compared
its Ultra Glide razor with Gillette's Atra Plus. The ad has been run
on several cable TV networks and several local stations.
   Boston-based Gillette said the response from Wilkinson was an
attempt to ``confuse the issue'' of Gillette's false advertising
claim.
   Spokeswoman Michele Szynal said Gillette had filed challenges to
the Wilkinson Sword ads with the networks but said that was a normal
procedure.
   Wilkinson is a small player in the $750 million wet-shave razor
market with about a 4 percent share, compared with more than 60
percent for Gillette.
   Hearings in the case were scheduled to begin Thursday in New York.

Oil</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPARKS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite its recent loss of influence, OPEC
will become a more important source of the world's oil in the 1990s,
its secretary general says.
   In a speech to a group of U.S. oil producers, Subroto said Monday
he thinks the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
satisfy up to half of the world's oil demand in the next five years,
up from about 40 percent today.
   ``In OPEC, we see the projected increase in our market share as
leading to the restoration of the influence which is our due,''
Subroto said.
   Conversely, he said, he expects oil production in non-OPEC
countries to fall by about 1 million barrels per day from present
levels during the first half of the 1990s.
   Subroto said no major oil discoveries have been made in non-OPEC
areas and production could drop even more with accidents due to
aging production facilities in the North Sea.
   ``With about 84 percent of the world's total reserves, our member
countries are well placed to support the expansion in world oil
demand projected for the early 1990s,'' he said.
   He added that the 13 OPEC nations are striving for a stable oil
market and he foresees no drastic price hikes over the next five
years.
   Subroto predicted ``only moderate increases in real oil prices''
over the period, but said OPEC's future market behavior will depend
on a variety of factors, including cooperation from independent oil
producers.
   He made his remarks to the U.S. Interstate Oil Compact
Commission, which represents U.S. oil producers. The commission's
semi-annual gathering will be held through Wednesday.
   Its chairman is Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, who gave an overview
Monday of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound and its
cleanu-up efforts.
   Cowper said the spill pointed out the need for more environmental
safeguards but warned they would drive up oil production costs.

   Japanese investors will buy more securities
backed by mortgages on American homes through a $570 million fund,
two Wall Street firms said.
   Salomon Brothers Inc. and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., the agents who
raised the money, said Monday the fund is the largest investing
primarily in U.S. mortgage securities ever offered outside the
United States.
   The Blackstone Fund for Fannie Mae Mortgage Securities, is
designed to attract more international capital, especially Japanese,
to American mortgage securities markets, the companies said.
   The fund's investment adviser is Blackstone Financial Management,
an affiliate of The Blackstone Group that has net assets of $2.2
billion.
   Fannie Mae, the Federal National Mortgage Association, is a
government-sponsored, privately owned corporation and the nation's
largest investor in home mortgages.
   The principals in the fund said it is part of Fannie Mae's
attempt to broaden the investor base for its mortgage-related
securities in foreign capital markets.
   Fannie Mae Chairman David O. Maxwell said, ``The ultimate winners
will be U.S. home buyers who will enjoy yet another source of
funding for mortgages.''

<HEAD>Fed Gives Morgan Subsidiary Permission to Underwrite Corporate Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board has given final
permission to a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. to underwrite
corporate debt, the first time the agency has granted that power to
a commercial bank.
   In January, the Federal Reserve authorized J.P. Morgan and four
other large banks to expand their securities underwriting, but
withheld final approval until it could review the management and
financing of the banks' securities subsidiaries.
   That approval was given to J.P. Morgan on Monday. Morgan is the
first to get the final nod.
   The others with pending applications are Citicorp, Chase
Manhattan Corp., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Security Pacific
Corp.
   Banks for some time have had the power to buy and sell U.S.
government securities and to underwrite and deal in general
obligation municipal bonds. In January, the Fed ruled that banks
could also underwrite corporate debt provided that the activity did
not generate more than 5 percent of all securities income.
   Corporate debt underwriting within that limit will not violate
the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial
from investment banking, the Fed ruled.
   The agency is expected to decide early next year whether banks
can engage in limited underwriting of corporate stock.

<TEXT>
   Alfred Checchi, the leader of an investment
group that has reached a tentative agreement to buy Northwest
Airlines' parent for about $4 billion, is only 41 years old, but
he's a veteran travel industry executive, wealthy investor and
seasoned takeover artist.
   At age 30 he was treasurer of the Marriott Corp., and three years
later he was a partner in the multibillion-dollar investment firm
run by the Bass Brothers of Texas.
   J. Willard Marriott Jr., the chairman of Marriott, has called him
``one of the brightest people I have ever known.''
   At Marriott, Checchi (pronounced CHECK-ee) sold hotels to outside
investors and kept management contracts to run them. The strategy
kept the debt needed to finance their construction off Marriott's
books.
   His investment group in the Northwest deal, Wings Holdings Inc.,
acquired 4.9 percent of the stock in Northwest parent NWA Inc.
before approaching the company in late March about a possible
acquisition.
   Northwest publicized Checchi's intentions on March 28, sparking a
bidding war that included offers from oil billionaire Marvin Davis.
Davis has an office in Los Angeles two floors below Checchi's.
   Checchi was with the Bass brothers when the firm bought a large
stake in the Walt Disney Co. The deal helped ward off a takeover bid
and ushered in a new and highly profitable Disney era.
   Checchi amassed personal wealth of more than $50 million in those
days before starting Alfred Checchi Associates with two friends from
his days at Marriott, Gary Wilson and Frederic Malek.
   Wilson, a former NWA board member, is Disney's chief financial
officer. Malek is a merchant banker in Washington, D.C., who once
was considered for the top job at Chicago-based United Airlines. In
the 1970s, Malek was a special assistant to President Carter and
deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. At Marriott,
Malek was president of the hotel group.
   Checchi also has been active in the Democratic Party. His father
was once a senior official of the Food and Drug Adminstration.

<HEAD>Analysts Look to Delaware Court For Key Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculation is growing that the courts may be the
next key arena in the fight for control of media giant Time Inc.
   Time's stock price fell again Monday following the company's
rejection last week of a $10.7 billion takeover bid by Paramount
Communications Inc. and its announcement of its own $14 billion,
$70-a-share tender offer for Warner Communications Inc.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Time lost $5.62{ a
share to close at $156.87{. It declined $9 a share Friday.
   Warner Communications rose 37{ cents a share to hit $59.62{, and
was the most active NYSE issue. Paramount shares gained $2.37{ a
share to close at $60.50.
   Either deal would create one of the world's largest entertainment
and media concerns, ensuring that an American company would be among
the global communications giants in the 1990s.
   Time and Warner announced in March that they planned to merge in
a stock swap transaction and amended that deal Friday to provide
that Time would offer $70-a-share for half of Warner's 200 million
shares followed by a merger in which Time would pay $70 in cash and
securities for the rest.
   Paramount has vowed to press ahead with its efforts to acquire
Time.
   Securities analysts said they expect Paramount to ask the
Chancery Court in Delaware, where all three companies are
incorporated, for a decision on the legality of the Time offer for
Warner.
   ``The game isn't over yet,'' said Dennis McAlpine, a media
analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``Clearly, the court is the next
issue.''
   Analysts expect Paramount will ask the court to determine whether
Time put itself up for sale by agreeing to merge with Warner
initially and whether Time directors acted appropriately by agreeing
to make the cash offer for Warner.
   Time has insisted it has not put itself up for sale, and that the
cash offer for Warner represented a revision of its original merger
plan.
   Paramount has argued that Time has put itself up for sale,
because Time stockholders would have only had about a 40 percent
interest in the merged company under the old plan. As a result,
Paramount is expected to argue that Time should be subject to an
auction _ including any Paramount bid.
   Ken Noble, who follows media stocks for PaineWebber Inc., said
his analysis indicated that stock in the resulting Time-Warner
combination would be valued by the market at about $173 a share.
   But he said the fact that Warner still was trading well below the
$70-a-share offered price ``implies there is still a lot of
speculation about all three stocks and about what will really
happen.''

<HEAD>Computer Associates To Buy Cullinet For $320 Million In Stock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest is getting bigger with an agreement
by Computer Associates International Inc. to buy troubled Cullinet
Software Inc. for about $320 million in stock.
   Computer Associates is the world's first independent software
company to achieve $1 billion in annual revenue, while Cullinet has
fallen on hard times and lost money each year since 1986.
   The companies announced a definitive merger agreement Monday,
subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Computer Associates,
of Garden City, N.Y., said it expected to close the deal in August.
   Analysts said they expect Computer Associates to follow its
tradition of slashing jobs at new acquisitions, a possibly painful
prospect for John Cullinane, the founder, chairman and biggest
stockholder of Cullinet, which is based in Westwood, Mass.
   ``Cullinane is paternal. It was clearly not the first choice of
John Cullinane that Computer Associates be the company that acquired
it,'' said Charles Federman, a partner of Broadview Associates, an
investment banking firm in Fort Lee, N.J.
   Computer Associates and Cullinet compete with each other and with
International Business Machines Corp. in selling software for big
mainframe computers made by IBM. Computer Associates also sells
software for smaller computers.
   Computer Associates is headed by Charles B. Wang, an aggressive
executive who has built the company from an also-ran mainly by
acquisitions and has promised to keep the company growing at 30
percent a year.
   Last year his company had revenue of $1.03 billion _ more than
better-known software makers such as Microsoft Corp. and Lotus
Development Corp. _ and a profit of $163.5 million.
   ``The proposed merger will combine the talents, technology and
resources of our two companies for the benefit of our clients,
employees and shareholders,'' Wang said in a statement.
   John Cullinane founded Cullinet in 1968. He retired in September
1987 but came back in March 1988 as the company continued to falter.
The company said Monday it lost $19.6 million last year on revenue
of $202.9 million.
   Computer Associates acquisitions have included Applied Data
Research Inc. for $170 million last year and Uccel Corp. for $800
million in 1987.
   Cullinet, itself once the world's biggest independent software
company, began to stumble when IBM targeted the mainframe data-base
software business in 1985.
   A Justice Department spokesman said the department would have no
immediate comment on the proposed transaction.
   The possibility that the Justice Department might block the
acquisition on antitrust grounds apparently kept some speculators
from buying Cullinet stock, Federman said. The stock sold Monday at
a discount to the value implied by the Computer Associates offer.
   Computer Associates shares fell 75 cents to close at $19.50,
while Cullinet rose 75 cents a share to $9 in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading. Computer Associates issued a 2-for-1 stock
split Friday.
   Shareholders of Cullinet will get half a share of Computer
Associates stock for each share of Cullinet they own. Based on
Monday's closing price for Computer Associates, that amounts to
$9.75 for each of the 33 million Cullinet shares outstanding.
   The transaction will be accounted for as a tax-free pooling of
interests.
   Computer Associates approached Cullinet about a merger last year
but was rebuffed. Earlier this year, Cullinet hired Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. to shop the company around, but apparently received no offers
better than the one from Computer Associates.

<TEXT>
   With two strikes against it, a dissident
movement within the United Auto Workers union will try again,
perhaps today, to make itself felt at the union's constitutional
convention.
   The New Directions movement is proposing a resolution that would
limit ``jointness'' in auto plants. The aim is to limit the growing
practice of union and management joining together on a variety of
projects inside and outside factories.
   It's a key issue for the strongest organized dissent in the 1
million member union in 40 years _ since the mid-1930s when Walter
Reuther took the reins of the union.
   If the voting on the ``jointness'' issue goes the way of other
New Directions-backed resolutions, the movement may strike out at
the convention. However, its leader, Jerry Tucker of St. Louis, has
said there is more grass-roots support for the movement than what
shows up at the convention.
   The forces of the Administration Caucus, led by UAW President
Owen Bieber, have easily put out any fires of dissent on the
convention floor. While hard voting figures are not available
because tallies are taken by a show of hands, New Directions hasn't
received support from more than 20 percent of the 2,000 delegates
attending the convention.
   On Monday, New Directions forces were turned back in an attempt
to require rank-and-file elections for the union's top national
officers, including the president, secretary-treasurer and vice
presidents. Currently those offices are filled through voting by the
delegates at constitutional conventions. Bieber is expected to win a
third three-year term in balloting Wednesday.
   Backers of the New Directions movement said a ``one-man,
one-vote'' policy would make the union's leadership more accountable
to the members. Administration Caucus members said nationwide
campaigning would be too time consuming. Besides, they said, the
system seems to be working now.
   But that didn't satisfy Dan Mallett of Local 31 in Fairfax, Kan.
   ``They pay their union dues, they deserve the right to vote,'' he
said from the floor during debate on the issue.
   But Jim McNeil of Local 600 in Dearborn, Mich., reading from the
convention's constitution committee report, said: ``A referendum is
only the outer shell of democracy. The convention system delivers
the substance.''
   The effort was defeated on a show-of-hands vote.
   On Sunday, the first day of the week-long convention, delegates
turned aside another New Directions move challenging the seating of
several local delegations from regions covering eight south-central
states and parts of metropolitan Detroit.
   Also Monday, delegates heard a campaign-style speech by U.S. Rep.
Richard Gephardt, an unsuccessful candidate for the 1988 Democratic
presidential nomination. Gephardt, in his first major speech since
being elected majority leader of the House of Representatives two
weeks ago, sounded themes similar to ones he and others raised
during last year's campaign.
   As he did during the campaign, he focused on the nation's trade
deficit, saying the Bush administration has ``made some good sounds
on trade.''
   ``It remains to be seen if they are tough,'' he added. ``If not,
we're going to have the Gephardt amendment or something like it.''
   The congressman from Missouri based a large part of his
unsuccessful presidential campaign last year on trade issues. The
legislation he proposed would have forced the president to take
action against countries that traded unfairly with the United States.
   ``You cannot compete against unfair competition,'' he said.
   Gephardt also criticized the Bush administration, saying the
nation needed to develop a comprehensive energy policy and to divert
spending from military hardware to education and the fight against
drugs.
   ``This is our time ... to make America great and good and strong
again,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest maker of disposable
diapers said today it will begin searching for ways to transform
billions of dirty didies from an ecological problem into recycled
flower pots, building insulation and lush highway medians.
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. announced it is backing research to see if
dirty disposable diapers can be cleaned and their components
recycled. The cost of the program was not immediately available.
   In a statement issued prior to today's scheduled news conference
at Washington's National Press Club, Bob Greene, P&amp;G's associate
director of research, said the company hoped to find ways of
handling ``disposable diapers and other materials in municipal solid
waste in ways that can bypass landfill disposal and recover valuable
resources.''
   The research, to be done in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington,
Florida and other states, comes as public concern is growing over
the 16 billion disposable diapers dumped annually in the nation's
overflowing landfills.
   While not the biggest component in the U.S. garbage pile _ waste
paper, bottles and cans are bigger contributors _ diapers cannot be
recycled like other trash.
   Environmentalists have warned that the plastic-coated disposable
diapers do not decompose, making their contents potential breeding
grounds for dangerous viruses and bacteria that cause polio,
hepatitis, meningitis and other diseases.
   As a result, lawmakers in Nebraska have banned the sale of
non-biodegradable diapers by 1993 and legislators in Iowa,
Washington and Oregon have considered similar action.
   The P&amp;G announcement detailed three separate projects. The first,
in cooperation with Seattle's Solid Waste Utility and Rabanco Co. of
Seattle, will collect used diapers from 1,000 households, wash and
sanitize them, then separate them into plastic and pulp.
   The plastic will be recycled into flower pots, garbage bags and
ersatz lumber used for landscaping. The pulp will be made into
cardboard boxes, building insulation and wallboard liner.
   ``Our aim is not to get into the diaper recycling business,''
project director Nancy Eddy said. ``Rather, we want to demonstrate
that the technology is feasible and encourage entrepreneurs to get
involved in this business.''
   In another project with the recycling firm Recomp Inc. of St.
Cloud, Minn., diapers will be put through a process that churns
garbage into a soil used to reclaim salt-tainted lands along
highways.
   The diaper giant also will finance research at the University of
Wisconsin that, over the next five years, will bury and exhume
regular and biodegradable disposable diapers at landfill sites in
Wisconsin, Florida and the Northeast.
   This landfill archeology will see if products touted as
biodegradable actually decompose any faster than the regular
disposable diapers made by P&amp;G.
   The stakes are high. P&amp;G owns a majority portion of the $3.5
billion disposable diaper industry. But that market share is being
threatened by a growing environmental awareness and aggressive
marketing by biodegradable diaper manufacturers and cloth diaper
services.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices were little
changed.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's short-term trend is downward
as a result of confusion created by last week's selloff. But they
said the outlook for the longer term remains bullish as there's
still underlying demand for dollars.
   One trader in Rome said the dollar-yen exchange rate has remained
surprisingly stable because of continued strong demand for dollars
out of the Far East, adding to the market's general confusion.
   He predicted that the dollar's downward correction could last one
week, before bullish sentiments would take the upper hand again.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.70 yen to a closing 143.80 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 143.63 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.9708 West German marks, down from 1.9735; 1.7047
Swiss francs, up from 1.7045; 6.6810 French francs, down from
6.6940; 2.2205 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2351; 1,427.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,439.75; and 1.1985 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1991.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5575 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5485 late Monday.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for
gold of $366.50 an ounce at midmorning, unchanged from late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $366.50 compared with $366.25 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 93 cents to close at a bid
$367.70.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.35 a troy ounce,
down from Monday's $5.37.

<HEAD>Dollar Tumbles, Japanese Stocks Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply against the Japaense yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 220.29 points, or 0.67
percent, finishing at 33,233.47.
   The dollar closed at 143.80 yen, down 1.70 yen from Monday's
145.50-yen finish. It opened at 143.75 yen and moved between 143.25
yen and 144.00 yen.
   Traders said most investors were adjusting their dollar holdings,
mainly because of uncertainties over the direction of the dollar-yen
rate after large swings last week.
   The dollar closed Thursday at 151.30 yen, its highest in almost
two years, and then fell 6.25 yen the next day.
   Yoshitsugu Hanada, a Mitsui Bank trader, said investors were
buying dollars at the 143-yen level, while Japanese trading houses
were selling as the dollar approached 144 yen.
   ``In mixed trading, the dollar has been gradually falling,''
Hamada said, adding that most investors no longer are looking for an
abrupt rise against the yen. But this does not mean bullishness
about the dollar has been totally reversed, he said.
   ``Now is the adjustment phase after the dollar's rapid rise to
the 151-yen level last week,'' said Hamada.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly was selling dollars to support the
yen, but the amount was not known. The central bank does not comment
on its foreign exchange activities.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the yen's surge against the
dollar reassured Japanese investors, encouraging stock purchases.
   Nomura Securities analyst Masahiro Umemori said, ``The market
rebounded by itself mainly because of recent stability in foreign
exchange.''
   ``It's too early to say the strong yen is back, but the foreign
exchange's stability was at least good news for stock trading,'' he
said, noting that the index had fallen more than 1,100 points last
week because of the dollar's sharp rise against the yen.
   Trading, however, was still inactive due to lingering
uncertainties over currency movements, Umemori said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 700 million shares,
up from 450 million the previous day.
   Among gainers were electricals including Sony and Sharp, as well
as steel and shipbuilding issuees.

   Share prices were firmer but below their intraday
peaks at midday Tuesday after new British money supply data for May
showed a higher-than-expected rise in bank and building society
lending.
   Dealers said prices were still underpinned by some moderate
futures-related buying and a general shortage of stock, which tended
to push prices higher.
   The market also drew comfort from another steady performance by
sterling, easing earlier fears that base lending rates would have to
be lifted above the current 14 percent level to defend the currency,
dealers said.
   Lending by banks and building societies rose by 6.7 billion
pounds, or $10.4 billion, in May, higher than market expectations of
around 5.9 billion pounds.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 16.4
points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,171.1 at midday.
   Volume was a moderate 321.5 million shares compared with 214.0
million shares at the same time Monday.

   The Chicago Board Options Exchange says it has
received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to
trade options on interest rates and will launch the new products on
Friday.
   Exchange officials say options on interest rates will eliminate
the inverse price-to-rate relationship associated with other
Treasury bond, Treasury bill and Treasury note markets and should
appeal to individual investors.
   ``For the first time, there will be a product based on the level
of interest rates themselves,'' CBOE Chairman Duke Chapman said in a
news release issued Monday.
   An option is a right to buy or sell a financial instrument or
commodity at a specified price by a given date. Investors can use
options to hedge their positions in cash markets or to speculate on
market movements.
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange is the world's largest options
market. The exchange said in it will offer options on both
short-term and long-term interest rates.
   The option on short-term rates will be based on the yield of the
most recently auctioned 13-week Treasury bill. The option on
long-term rates will be based on the average yield-to-maturity of
the two most recently auctioned 7-and 10-year Treasury notes and
30-year Treasury bonds.
   Unlike other interest-rate instruments, the price of these
products is based on a composite that is calculated using
interest-rate yields rather than the prices of bonds or bills.
   The prices of other interest-rate products move in the opposite
direction from the products' yields. But with the new options on
interest rates, prices will move in tandem with interest rates.
   The CBOE also lists options on 201 widely traded stocks, on the
Standard &amp; Poor's 100 and 500 stock indexes and on U.S. Treasury
bonds and notes.

   Sodinvest SA will sell its nearly 11
percent stake in Societe Generale de Belgique next week, boosting
the public's share in Belgium's top holding company to 13 percent,
officials said Tuesday.
   The offer for the 7 million shares will be officially launched
Monday.
   Sodinvest is an investment concern jointly owned by Group AG of
Belgium and Compagnie Financiere de Suez of France, who effectively
control Societe Generale.
   The public currently has a 2 percent share of Societe Generale.
Most of Societe Generale's shares were bought by institutions after
Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti launched a hostile takeover bid
for the company in January 1988.
   That battle left Suez and its allies with a 50.5 percent
controlling stake. An alliance of Belgian and Luxembourg companies
led by Group AG holds 16 percent, while Cerus SA, De Benedetti's
investment concern, holds 15 percent. Another 5 percent stake is
held by an anonymous investor.

<HEAD>Fears Linger That Checchi May Have To Compete With Hostile Suitor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 12th graf with 3 grafs of union comment.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts say Los Angeles investor Alfred
Checchi lined up a tidy deal to acquire the parent of Northwest
Airlines for about $4 billion, but some believe a hostile bidder
could mess it up.
   ``It's possible, but not likely,'' said Frederic Malek, a
Washington, D.C., merchant banker who is part of the group that
struck a $121-a-share takeover deal Monday with NWA Inc.
   The proposed acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and
Checchi faces a Sept. 18 deadline to complete the transaction. If
the deal collapses, NWA said, it would pay shareholders $70 cash a
share in a special dividend under a recapitalization, which would
cost about $2.1 billion.
   Kurt Rivard, an analyst for the brokerage Dain Bosworth Inc. of
Minneapolis, said the back-up plan could thwart a possible hostile
tender offer for the nation's fourth-largest airline company because
it would add unattractive debt to NWA.
   In other recent takeover battles, including the bidding war for
RJR Nabisco Inc., hostile offers were submitted after the company
announced an end to the bidding.
   Nabisco was ultimately purchased by the New York takeover firm of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which has long been rumored as a
suitor for NWA. Kohlberg Kravis has declined to comment on its
intentions involving NWA.
   Malek said hostile bidding will be deterred because it would take
a substantially higher offer for NWA to justify the expense of
reopening the auction, which spanned two months and included two
rounds of bidding.
   Conceding as much, Los Angeles oil billionaire Marvin Davis said
he tentatively supports the deal between NWA and Checchi's group,
Wings Holdings Inc.
   Davis, who owns 2.9 percent of NWA's common shares, is one of
three known suitors who were outbid by Checchi. The others were Pan
Am Corp. and Northwest's 20,000-member Machinists' union.
   ``While disappointed by the outcome, I am pleased that the NWA
special committee has elected to sell the company as we urged all
along,'' said Davis, who noted he was dropping his tender offer of
$2.7 billion, or $90 a share, which set off the bidding process.
   Pan Am issued a statement saying it was disappointed its bid was
not chosen. The ailing carrier said that it wanted its offer to be
reconsidered if the Checchi bid falters, and that the NWA
recapitalization would be worth less to shareholders than the Pan Am
bid. The airline has not disclosed the value of its offer.
   Northwest unions welcomed Checchi's bid.
   The International Association of Machinists said its first choice
would have been its own recapitalization offer. But ``we believe
that Checchi has a good history of operating, and is not just an
asset stripper,'' said Guy Cook, head of Northwest's IAM contingent,
which represents 21,000 mechanics, clerks, ticket agents and baggage
handlers.
   Rich Siakel, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association
said, ``We like things he talks about, like a program for growth to
strengthen the airline.''
   NWA said it chose Checchi's offer because it contained the
highest price, had the fewest contingencies and was the most likely
to succeed.
   ``I think the likelihood of this deal going through looks rather
high,'' Rivard said. ``It's certainly a fair price and it was at the
high end of the ranges that people were using.''
   NWA stock soared $6.50 a share Monday to close at $114.12{ on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Checchi's proposal includes $700 million equity and $3.35 billion
to be borrowed from a syndicate of banks led by Bankers Trust Co of
New York.
   Checchi's equity partners include KLM Royal Dutch Airlines;
Bankers Trust; Richard C. Blum and Associates, a San Francisco
merchant banking and investment firm; and Elders Finance Group, a
subsidiary of Elders IXL, an Australian investment company that
counts a brewery among its holdings.
   Checchi said he was not concerned about meeting financial fitness
requirements of the U.S. Transportation Department. Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner has said any leveraged buyout of Northwest
will be scrutinized to ensure that the carrier can operate safely in
the face of large takeover debts.
   ``My feeling was that commercial banks are relatively
conservative, so whatever level of debt they are comfortable with,
everyone should be comfortable with,'' said Checchi, 41.
   Significantly, Checchi's plan does not call for the use of
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, as do many takeover deals.
Northwest's unions said they would oppose a takeover involving this
type of financing.
   Checchi said his plan calls for ``substantial growth,'' including
the purchase of 138 new planes already on order or option by NWA. He
also said he would retain current management and keep Northwest's
headquarters in suburban Eagan. Malek said there would be no
layoffs, nor would any Northest assets be sold.
   William Genoese, president of the airline division of the
Teamsters union, said he would meet with Checchi's group later this
week.
   ``They want the company to grow,'' said Genoese, whose union
represents about 7,000 Northwest flight attendants and clerks. ``I'm
for anyone that comes in that will make things grow and improve
labor relations,''
   Checchi said he also would meet with leaders of the 5,000-member
Northwest pilots union this week. The pilots are negotiating a
contract and have said they will strike if they don't get a deal
that offers competitive wages and job security.

   The new subsidiary must consolidate Sabena's market share and
help it turn the Brussels airport, Sabena's home base, into a
European hub, he said.
   Van Rafelghem said Sabena, KLM and British Airways will remain
independent carriers, but he did not exclude further cooperation in
air services in and out of Brussels if ``such an arrangement is
entirely compatible with EEC competition law.''
   Johan Dekker, Sabena's vice president of operations, said the
participation of the Dutch and British air carriers in the new
subsidiary will run into ``billions of francs.''
   He declined to be more specific. A billion francs is about $25
million.
   Last year, Sabena increased its fleet and number of flights,
especially in Europe, began a $10 million expansion program on air
and ground services throughout Europe and also expanded services to
the Far East.
   Dekker said the injection of Dutch and British capital into the
new subsidiary will allow Sabena to implement a quick expansion
program to face stiffer competition as the European Economic
Community moves to dismantle the Community's internal borders as of
Dec. 31, 1992.

   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. said Tuesday it
was considering swapping its 20 percent stake in the British
conglomerate Lonrho PLC for an interest in Stroh Brewing Co. of
Detroit.
   A Bond official said discussions were being held with Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., the U.S. investment bank retained by Stroh in
February to seek a minority non-American partner.
   Stroh is a family-owned company and one of the largest brewers in
the United States.
   Bond owns G. Heileman Brewing Co. and Pittsburgh Brewing Co. of
the United States, and has breweries in Australia and brewing
interests in China and Hungary.
   Bond's Lonrho interest was acquired last year with the intention
of eventually making a friendly takeover, but the British company
has fought any overtures.
   The Bond official, who asked that he not be identified, refused
to comment on the talks but indicated his company might want a
controlling stake in Stroh. A Stroh spokeswoman wouldn't comment.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fokker, the Dutch airplane maker
that is gaining a strong foothold in the competitive North American
jetliner market, is in the final stages of negotiating a contract
with Pan Am Corp. for the purchase of 30 planes, a company spokesman
said Tuesday.
   The value of the deal, which is awaiting approval by Pan Am's
board, was estimated at $679 million, according to industry sources
here.
   The deal, involving the sale of up to 30 fuel-efficient Fokker
F-100 short-haul jetliners, signaled another step in Fokker's final
breakthrough on the American market, said spokesman Eduard van Veen.
   After teetering on the brink of bankruptcy because of huge
research and development costs only 18 months ago, Fokker now has
firm orders for 218 F-100s, as well as 183 options. For its F-50
commuter propjet, Fokker has 98 firm orders and 32 options, Van Veen
said.
   The Dutch airplane manufacturer made its biggest deal in the
United States so far earlier this year, when American Airlines
bought 75 F-100s and took as many options. Other U.S. customers are
USAir and Braniff Airways.
   Pan Am was expected to deploy the new planes in Europe for its
feeder network to London, one of the airline's major European hubs,
and for the shuttle services between West Berlin and West German
cities, according to Van Veen.
   The latest contract will speed up Fokker's search for a second
assembly line in addition to the one at Amsterdam's Schiphol
airport, which has a capacity of up to 48 planes a year, Van Veen
said.
   Although Fokker is considering bids to open an assembly line in
the United States, where some commercial jetliner manufacturers are
suffering from overcapacity, the company is believed to be under
considerable Dutch government pressure to concentrate its production
facilities in the Amsterdam area for employment reasons.
   A final decision on that issue is expected in three to four
weeks, Van Veen said.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout with announcement at annual meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 18 months of delays, Lotus Development Corp.
said today it has begun shipping its Release 3, an improved version
of the best-selling 1-2-3 computer software.
   Jim P. Manzi, the company's 37-year-old chairman, made the
announcement at Lotus' annual meeting in Boston.
   With the embarrassing delays last year, ``Lotus and Release 3 had
become the moral equivalent of the Boston Red Sox in the World
Series,'' Manzi said.
   ``We have come through a very tough period, and I believe we have
proved our mettle,'' he said.
   A key feature of the new software is the ability to display data
in three dimensions.
   Other computer spreadsheets show information along two axes,
allowing, for example, a store manager who wants to analyze his
seasonal sales pattern to put products along one axis and time
periods along the other.
   If he has several stores, however, the manager faces an
additional headache. With Release 3, he can cure it by creating a
third axis, representing various stores or geographic regions.
   After three years and tens of millions of dollars in development
costs, Lotus is betting that 3-D software, unlike movies, will turn
out to be more than a quick fad. Not everyone is sure.
   ``I think three dimensionality is a desirable function for a
certain percentage of the market, but what percentage, I don't
know,'' said Richard Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
in New York. ``Not everyone needs it.''
   Lotus, founded in 1982, has grown from a handful of employees to
more than 2,600 worldwide on the strength of 1-2-3, its original
product and still the source of nearly two-thirds of its sales,
which are projected at more than $500 million this year.
   But to keep ahead of competitors like Microsoft Corp. of Redmond,
Wash., and Borland International Corp. of Scotts Valley, Calif.,
Lotus has had to continually upgrade the program's features.
   For the top-secret Release 3 project, which Lotus code named
``Godiva,'' the firm three years ago assembled a small team of
engineers that quickly grew to more than 100 people. A confident
Manzi announced in April 1987 that Release 3 would be out in early
1988.
   But design and management problems, about which the company has
said little, intervened.
   Lotus said in February 1988 that Release 3 would not be ready
until late in the second quarter of 1988. A month later, the target
date was pushed back to the fourth quarter. Then, last October, the
company announced a further delay, until the second quarter of 1989.
   With its repeated failure to meet its own deadlines, Lotus'
earnings and stock price plunged, and its competitors picked up
market share.
   Manzi, a former management consultant who had taken over from
Lotus founder Mitch Kapor in 1986, was stung by intensely personal
negative publicity. Charles Digate, the executive in charge of
spreadsheets, resigned.
   Industry wags said the company was pioneering a new class of
products called ``vaporware'' _ software that disappears every time
it is about to be introduced.
   But Lotus apparently turned the corner last year when it brought
in W. Frank King, a former IBM manager, to head up the project. He
injected discipline into the project team and got Release 3 into
field test in February.
   As a result, Lotus stock has largely recovered, trading recently
at around $26 a share, close to its 52-week high of $26.75 and far
above its low for the year of $14.75.
   Competitors are still close on the firm's heels, with Microsoft
steadily enhancing its Excel software, the No. 2 spreadsheet on the
market, and Borland reportedly working on a 3-D version of its
Quattro program.
   At Lotus' annual meeting today in the Berklee Performance Center
attended by more than 400 people, the company showed a wide-screen
television transmission from its manufacturing center in Cambridge
with boxes of Release 3 rolling off an assembly line and being
packed for shipment to customers across the country.
   The delays have ``cost them a lot of clout in the market and
tarnished their reputation,'' Sherlund said in advance of the
announcement. ``Now it's their time to shine.''

<HEAD>Company Selling Theme Parks in Four States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. announced
today it will sell its Sea World theme parks in four states and two
other Florida attractions to help retire the huge debt it incurred
in fighting off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt.
   The sale of the Sea World marine parks in Florida, Texas, Ohio
and California and Boardwalk &amp; Baseball and Cypress Gardens in
Central Florida is the only way HBJ ``can substantially reduce the
company's obligations'' and make the necessary investments in its
publishing and insurance divisions, a company statement said.
   In midmorning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Harcourt
rose $3 a share to $13.12{ after the disclosure.
   The decision came about after recent talks between HBJ's
chairman, William Jovanovich, and its new president, Ralph D. Caulo,
according to the announcement.
   The statement said Caulo ``is prepared to leave HBJ in order to
manage these businesses under new ownership.''
   The brief announcement made no mention of a possible buyer for
the six parks, and a tract of land next to Orlando International
Airport.
   ``The HBJ directors have authorized this sale, which is subject
to the approval of HBJ's lenders,'' the statement said. ``Mr.
Jovanovich and Mr. Caulo have agreed that Mr. Caulo will direct the
sale of these assets, whether made to a corporation or to a
syndicate of investors.''
   There was no further comment from the company. Jovanovich was
unreachable for comment and Caulo did not immediately return
telephone calls to his office.
   HBJ, a Fortune 500 company and the nation's largest textbook
publisher, fought a hostile takeover by British publisher Robert
Maxwell in 1987 by adopting a costly defense known as a
recapitalization.
   It financed the plan by borrowing from banks and selling
so-called junk bonds, ballooning its debt to $2.9 billion.
   HBJ lost $126.5 million, or $2.04 a share, last year compared
with a 1987 profit of $64.4 million, or $1.34 a share. The loss came
despite increased sales of 17 percent, to a record $1.78 billion,
over 1987.
   The improved sales were caused by strong demand for HBJ's
textbooks and insurance policies, plus the opening of its new Sea
World theme park near San Antonio, Tex., according to analysts.
   During its first quarter, HBJ reported larger-than-usual losses
in its publishing division. It lost $46.2 million in the first three
months of the year, or nearly $19 million more than in the same
period a year earlier.
   The company recently underwent a reshuffling of that division,
relocating sales and marketing personnel and eliminating some 200
jobs.

   Three union leaders jailed for encouraging
strikers to block mine entrances were freed today after promising to
obey a judge's restrictions, raising hopes for an end to a wildcat
walkout by 27,000 miners in nine states.
   The United Mine Workers officials said after leaving the judge's
chambers that they can win their dispute against the Pittston Coal
Group in spite of the judge's ban on tactics such as sit-down
demonstrations to block coal trucks.
   ``This strike is still building,'' said strike coordinator Marty
Hudson as a cheering crowd of about 35 striking miners and family
members waited outside the court of U.S. District Judge Glen
Williams. He and his two colleagues had been released from a Roanoke
jail Monday night pending today's hearing.
   ``There are no white flags on these hands. We're going to win
this strike. We're not turning back,'' Hudson said.
   Hudson said he and the other jailed leaders decided to purge
themselves of a contempt charge and promised to obey the order
because striking miners told them they were needed on picket lines.
He also said the three were needed to testify for UMW supporters who
were arrested in sit-down demonstrations.
   Also released were Jackie Stump, president of UMW's southwest
Virginia district, and C.A. Phillips, a UMW international
representative.
   The judge's June 5 decision to jail the three without bond until
they promised to end civil disobedience against Pittston has been a
rallying point for wildcat sympathy strikes by some 27,000 UMW
members in nine states.
   Roger Caldwell, a UMW field representative in West Virginia, said
the unauthorized strikes probably will continue as miners turn their
attention to the $3 million in fines levied against the UMW by a
Virginia state judge.
   ``What good is it to have them out of jail if they're going break
the union anyway?'' Caldwell asked.
   The three leaders will be kept away from picket sites and instead
be used at meetings in other communities, said Cecil Roberts, UMW
vice president.
   ``We are interested in satisfying him (the judge) that these
people will obey his order,'' Roberts said.
   Williams held the three on contempt of court for violating his
order restricting strike activity. The sit-down demonstrations, in
which more than 2,000 striking miners and supporters have been
arrested, have since ended.
   Hours before the three were released from jail, the wildcat
strike ended in Virginia when 790 UMW employees returned to their
jobs. But 5,000 more miners in Alabama, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio
joined the walkout.
   That brought to more than 27,000 the number of miners on strike
against coal operators in nine states, not including the 1,800
picketing Pittston in a contract dispute. The UMW has about 80,000
active members nationwide.
   Bobby R. Brown, president of Consolidation Coal Co. in
Pittsburgh, joined other coal company officials in criticizing the
wildcatters. ``I do not know what the issues are except sympathy,''
he said. ``I think it's a very serious mistake by the UMW.''
   Brown also said he feared the union members' actions would hurt
exports.
   ``I think now we're going to have to live through being a not
very stable supplier because of the wildcat strikes,'' he said.
   About 1,600 UMW employees walked off their Pittston jobs in
Virginia and West Virginia on April 5 after working more than 14
months without a contract. The strike spread to Pittston's Kentucky
operations Monday, idling 200 more UMW members.
   Pittston has refused to sign a nationwide contract and wants its
own pact that would include mandatory overtime, Sunday work and a
cut in pension benefits. The UMW insists that the company sign a
contract requiring Pittston to pay into the national pension fund
and keep mines closed on Sundays.
   The wildcat strikers on Monday numbered 16,000 in West Virginia;
3,900 in Alabama; 2,500 in Pennsylvania; 1,750 in Indiana; 1,270 in
Kentucky; 1,100 in Ohio; 650 in Illinois; 338 in Missouri, and 200
in Tennessee.

   Rolls-Royce PLC announced Tuesday that Trans World
Airlines has chosen its most powerful long-haul engine to power
recently-ordered Airbus A-330 airliners in a deal worth over $620
million.
   TWA has agreed to buy 20 of the A-330 twin-engined aircraft along
with an option for 20 additional aircraft, making it the largest
A-330 order to date, worth up to $4 billion.
   TWA is scheduled to take delivery of the planes in late 1994. The
contract between TWA and Airbus, a European aircraft-building
consortium, was signed Tuesday.
   The aircraft-engine combination will likely be used on longer
A-330 operations over the Atlantic, Rolls-Royce said.
   TWA is the third airline to specify the RB211-524L engine for its
aircraft since its launch last year.

<HEAD>BP Plans To Upgrade Refinery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OREGON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of British Petroleum America
Inc. will spend $102 million for improvements to a 31-year-old
refinery in this Toledo suburb, a company official said Tuesday.
   The project is intended to reduce operating costs, improve air
quality and reinforce the refinery's competitive position, said
Clare Tyler, manager of BP Oil Co.'s Oregon refinery. It involves
replacing four refining operations with one unit.
   No increase in employment is expected, Tyler said. The refinery
employs 470 people. Construction is to begin after Oct. 1, and
should be complete by the end of 1991.
   Eric Schwamberger, vice president of Local 7-346 of the Oil,
Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers International Union, said BP's plans could
improve the union's relations with the company.
   ``If BP is willing to sink this kind of money into this project,
it should translate into job security,'' Schwamberger said.
   The former Standard Oil refinery has been the site of at least
three bitter strikes since 1975, including a four-month strike in
early 1988 when the company tried to reduce wages and beneifts.

   Corn and soybean futures prices dropped
substantially Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as wetter
weather forecasts for the Corn Belt took the edge off drought fears.
Wheat futures also retreated.
   The corn and soybean markets lost about half of the ground they
gained Monday, when the Midwest looked to be due for an extended

   Tuesday's forecasts predicted rain in the northern and western
reaches of the Corn Belt by the end of this week, and selling

   Analysts also cited technical resistance to a further advance
after Monday's strong rally, which followed four days of gains in
the corn and soybean pits.
   ``The market needs to test support and find out that it's solid
before it tries to move up again,'' said William Biedermann,
director of research at Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in
Crystal Lake, Ill.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 2 cents lower with July at

<HEAD>Wasserstein, Perella And A&amp;P Bid For Gateway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A&amp;P and a U.S. investment firm have joined in a $3
billion cash bid for Gateway Corp., Britain's third-largest food
retailer, and Gateway has urged shareholders to accept it.
   Forged Monday night, the U.S. offer valued Gateway at $3.39 a
share and would give 50-50 ownership of the company to Wasserstein,
Perella &amp; Co. and A&amp;P, which is the fourth-largest U.S. food
retailer. A&amp;P is 52.5 percent owned by West Germany's Tengelmann
Group.
   The partners will put up a total of $780 million and borrow
another $3.4 billion from banks and other sources. Some of the money
will go toward refinancing more than $600 million of debt on
Gateway's books.
   Gateway Chairman Alec Monk would remain chairman under the deal,
but A&amp;P Chairman James Wood would take over as chief executive
officer in addition to his current duties.
   Long outperformed by competitors, Gateway in April became the
target of a $2.9 billion hostile bid from investor group Isosceles
PLC, a consortium.
   Isosceles may find it hard to increase its already sweetened
offer to beat the new one, analysts said. The consortium has
effective control of about 27 percent of Gateway shares outstanding.
   The offer expires Thursday.
   Monk, who spent about $2.0 billion on takeovers between 1982 and
1986, transformed a struggling family-run wholesale food business
known as Linfood Holdings into a big British retail holding company.
   Monk financed a number of acquisitions through stock offerings,
doubling the company's shares outstanding and depressing its share
price. Support among shareholders slipped further when he ran into
difficulty digesting Herman's Sporting Goods Inc. of Carteret, N.J.,
acquired for $414 million in 1986.
   Gateway controls about 11.4 percent of the British grocery market.
   The company posted a 3.3 percent drop in pretax profit for the
fiscal year ended April 30, 1988, the latest full-year results
available.
   In a leveraged buy-out, a group of investors purchases a company
from shareholders, largely with borrowed funds, then repays the debt
through normal operations and asset sales.

   The stock market finished lower today in dull
trading, with only limited momentum coming from issues of companies
involved in takeover situations.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended slightly lower
after hovering in a narrow range through most of the trading session.
   The market ``is fatigued if not exhausted,'' said Michael Metz,
an analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``I think we've entered the summer doldrums early,'' he said,
referring to Wall Street's customary summer slowdown that usually
starts in early July.
   The market opened with an advance fueled by stocks involved in
``special situations.'' But analysts said the rally ran out of steam
shortly before noon as buying interest waned.
   Airline issues remained active following news Monday that
Northwest Airlines' parent NWA Inc. accepted a $4 billion buyout
offer from a group led by Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi.
   On the New York Stock Exchange today, NWA fell after soaring on
Monday. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a leading credit-rating agency,
said late in the day that a completed purchase by the Checchi group
would likely cause the agency to downgrade its rating of NWA. The
acquisition would increase NWA's total debt from $945 million to
$3.7 billion, second only to Texas Air Corp. among U.S. airlines,
Standard &amp; Poor's said.
   Pan Am, a loser in the battle for NWA, rose. AMR Corp., the
parent of American Airlines, advanced strongly.
   ``The pizzazz lies in the deal situations,'' said Larry Wachtel,
an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``All the airlines

   Other takeover-related issues also were actively traded. They
included Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which announced plans to sell

<HEAD>IBM Is First To Announce Personal Computer With Next-Generation Chip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. scored a
public-relations victory Tuesday by becoming the first company to
announce a personal computer containing the next-generation
microchip from Intel Corp.
   The computer will not be entirely new, and it will not be
available until the end of the year, but analysts saw it as a
psychological victory for IBM, which has been upstaged repeatedly by
rival Compaq Computer Corp.
   ``Compaq must really have bugged them. They have gotten tired of
Compaq beating them to the market with the latest chip or the
fastest chip,'' said Jonathan Seybold, publisher of Seybold Reports
in Malibu, Calif.
   ``This is a shot across the bow from IBM, that's about it,'' said
Richard Shaffer, editor of Computer Letter in New York.
   IBM said it will sell a $3,995 circuit board containing Intel's
new i486 chip. The board will replace the microprocessor in one of
IBM's Personal System-2 Model 70-A21 computers, making it run twice
as fast as the fastest personal computers available today, IBM said.
   The circuit board will go on sale as soon as the chips are
available from Intel, which is expected to be the final quarter of
this year. The price of the computer they go into was cut to $8,995
from $11,295.
   Compaq said the announcement is unimportant because the computer
the new chip will go into _ the Model 70-A21 _ lacks the memory
capacity and room for add-on equipment that Compaq's own
high-powered models have.
   The limitations mean the computer cannot take full advantage of
the new i486 chip's power for such jobs as computer-aided design and
engineering.
   Compaq faulted IBM for announcing the product before it is ready.
It is ``absolutely'' possible that Compaq will begin delivering a
computer based on the i486 chip before IBM does, Michael Swavely,
the president of Compaq North America, said in an interview.
   ``Who announces first really doesn't matter a whole lot,''
Swavely said.
   In contrast, Robert Carberry, IBM's vice president for systems in
the personal computer organization, said, ``I think we're very well
positioned'' to be the first to deliver a computer based on the i486.
   The Model 70-A21 was selected as the first housing for the i486
chip because its design allows it to accept different
microprocessors easily. IBM said other members of its PS-2 family
would also be equipped with the new chip over time, although the
upgrade will be more complex.
   Ever since Compaq brought out the first 80386-based personal
computer in 1986, IBM has been trying to catch up in unit shipments
of those machines, which are the most powerful IBM-compatible ones
currently on the market.
   IBM may hit No. 1 in the segment in the current April-June
quarter, David Thomas, president of IBM's National Distribution
Division, said in an interview Tuesday.
   Analysts said that regardless of the technological significance
of IBM's announcement, they admired the competitive zeal IBM was
displaying.
   ``I think it's a very clever idea,'' Seybold said.
   Separately, IBM tried to steal some thunder from another rival,
Apple Computer Inc., by announcing new products that allow people to
use their personal computers as editing stations for video and
sound. The hardware makes it possible for people to produce
multimedia presentations on their desktop, IBM said.

<HEAD>Silver Drops As Dollar Gains, Inflation Fears Wane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices slid about 9 cents an ounce Tuesday on New
York's Commodity Exchange as the dollar strengthened and other
commodity prices fell, easing inflation fears. Gold futures prices
also dropped.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell, energy futures
were mixed, and livestock and meat prices were mixed.
   Silver settled 9 cents to 9.1 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $5.25 a troy ounce; gold was 70 cents to $1
lower with August at $369.60 a troy ounce.
   Precious metals prices had been on the upswing, rising in five of
the six previous sessions on perceptions that inflation was
gathering steam. Precious metals are considered a safe investment in
times of rising prices.
   Inflation worries had intensified after sharp increases in most
commodity futures prices on Monday, and many precious-metals traders
expected the rally to continue Tuesday. Instead, most commodity
prices opened steady or lower.
   The dollar began the day on a weak note, which supported the
precious metals early in the session, but it turned sharply higher
by the end of the day and became a major negative influence on the
metals.
   Jim Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York, said
precious-metals traders will continue to watch the dollar for
direction.
   ``If we see continued dollar strength over the summer, I think
the metals will have no other option but to go lower,'' he said.
   Metals broker Jerry Rothman of Elders Futures Inc. in New York
said further selling was prompted by the July silver contract's
inability to push above $5.39 an ounce, the previous day's high.
   July silver topped out at $5.38 on its third rally attempt, and
many traders then gave up and sold the market, Rothman said.
   Corn and soybean futures prices dropped on the Chicago Board of
Trade as wetter weather forecasts for the Corn Belt took the edge
off drought fears. Wheat futures also retreated.
   The corn and soybean markets lost about half of the ground they
gained Monday, when the Midwest looked to be due for an extended
spell of hot, dry weather.
   But Tuesday's forecasts predicted rain in the northern and
western Corn Belt by the end of this week, and selling pressure was
strong from the opening bell.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 2\ cents lower with July at $3.95} a
bushel; corn was 2} cents to 5{ cents lower with July at $2.66} a
bushel; oats were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with July at $1.68\ a
bushel; soybeans were 8{ cents to 12\ cents lower with July at
$7.36\ a bushel.
   The July crude-oil contract expired with a $1.33 loss at $19.53 a
barrel after a volatile trading session that saw the price whipsaw
from $19.02 to $21.30 a barrel.
   Experts said the wild action on the New York Mercantile Exchange
signified no new supply-and-demand developments and was solely a
function of the contract's expiration.
   Other West Texas Intermediate crude-oil contracts settled 8 cents
lower to 4 cents higher with August at $18.88 a barrel; heating oil
was .35 cent to .45 cent lower with July at 45.69 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .17 cent to .48 cent higher with July at 59.17
cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in a session featuring profit-taking after
Monday's sharp runup.
   Live cattle settled .28 cent lower to .75 cent higher with June
at 73.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .47 cent
lower with August at 81.35 cents a pound; live hogs were .55 cent
lower to .18 cent higher with June at 49.15 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .20 cent lower to .67 cent higher with July at
34.50 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Crude oil prices plunged more than $1 a barrel in
thin trading Tuesday while other petroleum products ended mixed.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, finished $1.33
lower at $19.53 a barrel, after gaining 91 cents on Monday. Other
contract months were mixed.
   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc.,
attributed the sell-off in crude to the fact that the near-month
contract was set to expire on Tuesday.
   He noted that prices started out sharply higher, with the July
contract up as much as $21.30 a barrel, but that they plunged later
in the session as demand fizzled.
   ``There really were no fundamental reasons'' for the decline,
Beutel said.
   The drop in crude helped pull down heating oil. The July contract
for wholesale No. 2 heating oil slipped 0.37 cent to 45.69 cents a
gallon, after settling 0.86 cent higher on Monday.
   Among other refined petroleum products, unleaded gasoline for
July delivery rose 0.17 cent to 59.17 cents a gallon. The contract
was up 0.86 cent the previous session.

<HEAD>Lotus Ships Long-Awaited Release 3 Spreadsheet Software</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After an 18-month delay that drove down its stock
and depressed its earnings, Lotus Development Corp. said Tuesday it
has begun shipping an improved version of its best-selling 1-2-3
computer software.
   More than 400 stockholders burst into cheers at Lotus' annual
meeting as a live video hookup showed boxes of the long-awaited
spreadsheet program, named Release 3, rolling off an assembly line
at the company's Cambridge manufacturing center.
   With that triumph behind him, Jim Manzi, Lotus' 37-year-old
chairman, was able to talk about the embarrassing delays with humor.
   ``Lotus and Release 3 had become the moral equivalent of the
Boston Red Sox in the World Series,'' he said. ``... We have come
through a very tough period, and I believe we have proved our
mettle.''
   Teresa Lotzgesell, an analyst with the Seattle brokerage house of
Ragen Mackenzie, said the delay in producing Release 3 was a boon to
competitors like Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., and Borland
International Corp. of Scotts Valley, Calif.
   Lotus, founded in 1982, once had a near lock on the $600
million-a-year market for computer spreadsheets. Now, Microsoft's
Excel program has about 12 percent of the market, Borland's Quattro
has between 5 and 10 percent, and various other programs have about
10 percent, Lotzgesell said.
   ``Wih people waiting and waiting and waiting (for Release 3),
Lotus did lose customers,'' she said. ``Now they may win some back.''
   Release 3 originally was due out in early 1988. When Lotus
delayed its arrival three times, reportedly because of problems
transferring the basic machine code into the computer language
``C,'' many analysts cut their 1989 earnings projections by 20
percent or more.
   Lotus stock also plunged, although it has since bounced back to
about $26 a share from a 52-week low of $14.75.
   Now, said analyst Richard Sherlund of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in New
York, the question is whether Release 3 can recapture the momentum
for Lotus, which has 2,600 employees and reported sales of $468.5
million last year.
   One of the key advantages of Release 3 is the ability to display
data in three dimensions, showing a row of up to 256 spreadsheets.
But that ability makes the program something of a memory hog; to run
it efficiently, a computer must have the latest generation of Intel
286 or 386 microchips and more than 1 megabyte of random access
memory.
   Release 2.2, a version for less powerful, IBM XT- and
PC-compatible machines, is due out later this year. Other versions,
including one rich in graphics and one for Apple Macintosh
computers, also are planned.
   Manzi, who took over from Lotus founder Mitchell D. Kapor in
1986, endured harsh criticism for the company's delays and for his
compensation, which totaled more than $26 million in 1987. But on
Tuesday, he was clearly enjoying himself.
   Thanking the team of more than 100 engineers and programmers who
produced Release 3, he told stockholders that ``These people have
shown unbelievable dedication, unbelievable skill, and an equally
unbelievable ability to eat cold pizza late at night.''

<HEAD>Survey Says Shrinking Youth Population Changing Consumer Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decline in America's young adult population
will be accompanied by a rise in average household income so the age
group's buying power will hold steady, a research group said Tuesday.
   The Conference Board said the pool of young people will shrink
significantly as the 20th century comes to a close due to a slowdown
in the birth rate that began in the 1960s.
   The number of people between the ages of 20 and 35 will fall by
about 10 million during the next 15 years from about 63 million in
1985, forecasts say.
   Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's
consumer research center, said over the past decade and a half young
people have been the biggest growth segment of the U.S. consumer
market.
   ``But in the years ahead they will hold considerably less promise
for marketers of a wide variety of products and services,'' Linden
said.
   He estimated that currently one out of every four dollars of
total household income flows to homes headed by persons under 35
years old. The amount is expected to fall to less than one dollar
out of every five by the year 2000.
   However, the real buying power of this age group isn't expected
to contract.
   ``The increase in average household earnings over the next decade
will offset the decline in the number of households,'' Linden said.
``Additionally, because there will be fewer available American
workers between the ages of 20 and 35, they will likely receive
higher pay.''
   The Conference Board is a nonprofit research-oriented group
supported by businesses, trade and professional organizations,
government agencies, unions and others.

   The dollar gained against major foreign
currencies in domestic dealings Tuesday after a mixed performance
abroad.
   Gold prices posted minor changes. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid of $365 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, $1
lower than Monday's late bid.
   New York-based currency dealers said the dollar closed at the
high end of the range within which it has traded recently.
   ``Basically, it was a reasonably quiet day but the dollar did
move well in its range,'' said Samuel Lek, a managing director in
the foreign exchange department of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   Lek said there was no fundamental reason for the dollar's gain.
Dealers probably decided the time was right to increase their dollar
holdings after lightening them in recent days, he said.
   Lately when the dollar has staged a strong advance, central banks
have stepped into the market to knock it down by selling dollars.
Lek said there may have been a modest amount of intervention on
Tuesday.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo by losing ground. The
dollar closed there at 143.80 Japanese yen, down from 145.50. In
London, the dollar headed slightly higher, to 143.85 yen. It climbed
further to 144.90 yen in later New York trading, up from 144.60
Monday.
   Reports of dollar sales by the Bank of Japan contributed to a
mixed showing for the dollar in European trading.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5553 late Tuesday, up from
Monday's late bid of $1.5485. Later, sterling fetched $1.5405 in New
York, down from $1.5430 on Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's
rates, included: 1.9870 West German marks, up from 1.9785; 1.7205
Swiss francs, up from 1.7090; 1.19875 Canadian dollars, up from
1.19865; 6.7315 French francs, up from 6.7155; and 1,440.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,431.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday's levels were:
1.9775 West German marks, up from 1.9735; 1.7110 Swiss francs, up
from 1.7045; 6.7025 French francs, up from 6.6940; 2.2255 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.2351; 1,431.75 Italian lire, down from
1.439.75; and 1.2000 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1991.
   Gold bullion prices finished unchanged to slightly lower.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $366.30 a troy ounce, down from $367.10. Gold
closed in London at a bid of $366.50 an ounce, unchanged from late
Monday. The late bid price in Zurich was $366.00 an ounce, down from
$366.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $366.95 an ounce, up from
$366.25.
   Silver prices declined a bit. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery fell to $5.234 a troy ounce from Monday's
settlement of $5.323. Silver bullion traded in London at $5.34 a
troy ounce, down from $5.37.

   The stock market finished lower Tuesday in dull
trading. What little action there was came from stocks of companies
involved in takeovers.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 7.01 points to
2,472.88 after hovering in a narrow range through most of the
trading session.
   Declining issues edged out advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
774 down, 657 up and 539 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 167.65 million
shares, up from 130.72 million in Monday's session, which had been
the slowest pace in more than two months.
   The market ``is fatigued if not exhausted,'' said Michael Metz,
an analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``I think we've entered the summer doldrums early,'' he said,
referring to Wall Street's summer slowdown that usually starts in
early July.
   The market started with an advance fueled by stocks involved in
``special situations.'' But analysts said the rally ran out of steam
shortly before noon as buying interest waned.
   Airline issues remained active following news Monday that
Northwest Airlines' parent NWA Inc. accepted a $4 billion buyout
offer from a group led by Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi.
   Oil billionaire Marvin Davis, who had launched a rival bid for
NWA, said late Tuesday he was terminating his offer and didn't
intend to raise it.
   On the NYSE, NWA was down ] at 113} after soaring on Monday. Pan
Am, a loser in the battle for NWA, was up \ at 4. AMR Corp., the
parent of American Airlines, had jumped 1{ to 63{. United Airlines'
parent UAL Corp. surged 5| to 133{ after several analysts said they
believe its asset value is far higher than its current stock price.
   ``The pizzazz lies in the deal situations,'' said Larry Wachtel,
an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``All the airlines
are going berserk.''
   Other takeover-related issues also were actively traded. They
included Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which announced plans to sell
its six theme parks and its real estate holdings. It jumped 3} to
13~.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 201.39 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $5.16 billion, or 0.16
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 0.30 to 179.49.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index declined 0.75 to 367.37, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.64 at 321.25.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
1.51 to 444.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 361.72, down 0.67.

   A federal judge Tuesday approved an unprecedented
civil securities fraud settlement between the government and Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., placing the Wall Street firm under strict
supervision and barring it from dealing with its former junk bond
financier Michael Milken.
   Approval of the pact by U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack
cleared the way for Drexel to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a
record $650 million in order to settle separate criminal charges
with the Justice Department.
   The civil settlement was reached in April but was held up by
legal challenges from Milken's attorneys that reached the Supreme
Court. Milken alleged Pollack had a conflict of interest and should
have been removed from the case.
   In a brief hearing at federal court in lower Manhattan, Pollack
said that after ``careful study'' he granted the joint request by
Drexel and the SEC to approve the proposed settlement.
   The SEC charged Drexel last fall with insider trading and other
securities frauds involving more than 20 takeovers and other
investment deals between 1984 and 1986.
   Under its settlement, Drexel neither admitted nor denied having
committed the alleged crimes.
   The settlement does not include separate civil charges by the SEC
against Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bond division who
resigned from the firm last week. Milken also has been indicted on
criminal fraud and racketeering charges stemming from his activities
at Drexel.
   ``This settlement will bring to a close 2{ difficult years for
Drexel, its employees and its clients,'' Drexel lawyer Thomas Curnin
said in court.
   Curnin said approval of the pact would allow Drexel ``to go
forward and devote its time and energies to the service of its
clients.''
   Thomas Newkirk, the SEC's chief litigation counsel in the Drexel
case, asked Pollack to approve the settlement quickly so Drexel
could adopt the settlement provisions designed to ``protect
investors'' and continue to cooperate with the government.
   ``This cooperation is essential not only to the commission's
ongoing investigations but to investigations being conducted by the
United States attorney,'' Newkirk said.
   The settlement requires Drexel to overhaul its securities law
compliance operations, top management and some trading departments
and to submit to three years of close SEC scrutiny. It does not take
effect until the criminal plea bargain with the Justice Department
is approved.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood now is expected to begin
considering the deal reached in December over the criminal case
against Drexel by the Manhattan U.S. atttorney's office.
   The SEC pact, though, marks another milestone in the government's
three-year investigation of white-collar corruption on Wall Street
that began with former Drexel executive Dennis Levine and led to
arbitrager Ivan Boesky, who paid $100 million to settle civil
insider trading charges with the SEC in late 1986.
   Boesky's confessions led the government to Drexel, which agreed
to settle partly because of the possibility of a broad racketeering
indictment that could have put the nation's fifth-largest securities
firm out of business.
   Approval of the SEC pact, which was hammered out during three
months of negotiations, was delayed because of challenges by Milken
and his brother Lowell, a former Drexel employee who also faces
criminal and civil charges.
   The Milkens argued that Pollack should be removed from the case
because of an alleged conflict of interest in which his wife stood
to profit from a buyout Drexel helped to finance.
   Drexel fought the assignment of Pollack from the time the SEC
brought its sweeping civil case last September. Pollack refused to
step down and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his
decision.
   But the appeals court issued a stay preventing Pollack from
taking any action in the case so that the Milkens could ask for a
Supreme Court hearing. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court refused
to consider the case.
   The SEC settlement also required Drexel to fire Milken and bar
its employees from doing business with him or any clients he is
advising.
   Lawyers for Milken had been expected to mount a further challenge
on the basis that the provisions were unconstitutional. But with
Milken's resignation from the firm, the move was deemed unnecessary,
lawyers said.
   Milken's attorneys attended Tuesday's hearing but made no comment.
   Milken still is challenging the criminal settlement between
Drexel and the Justice Department on the grounds it unfairly
requires Drexel to withhold his 1988 compensation of more than $100
million.
   The Milkens were named March 29 in a 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment handed seeking more than $3.7 billion in
forfeitures. They have pleaded innocent to the charges. Trial is set
to begin in March 1990.

   A government prosecutor charged Tuesday that
officials of Princeton-Newport Partners LP and Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. illegally bought and sold stocks in a widespread tax
fraud scheme amounting to ``plain, old-fashioned cheating.''
   In opening arguments in the first racketeering case ever
involving securities trading, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Hansen
said the six defendants engaged in a ``very simple criminal scheme''
between 1984 and 1986 to generate phony tax losses.
   He also said prosecutors would play incriminating tapes in court,
one of which includes a Drexel trader telling a Princeton-Newport
partner, ``Welcome to the world of being a sleaze.''
   ``This is a case about cheating,'' Hansen said in a packed
courtroom at U.S. District Court in Manhattan. ``These defendants
are wealthy, successful men, men who decided they were above the
law, who decided they could break the law without being caught.''
   On trial are five officials of the defunct investment partnership
and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg. The case overlaps the
government's indictment of former Drexel financier Michael Milken.
Neither of the firms is on trial.
   Hansen alleged that Drexel via Newberg purchased stocks from
Princeton-Newport, then sold them back a short time later to create
bogus losses that Princeton-Newport declared as tax deductions. The
indictment in the case, handed up last August, alleged $13 million
in bogus tax losses.
   Moving his left hand up and down, Hansen equated the alleged
illegal trades with the motion of a yo-yo.
   ``These sales were on a string,'' he said. ``When the
Princeton-Newport defendants sent those securities out, they sent
them out waiting for the moment when they could bring them back with
a little tug of the hand.''
   ``When Princeton-Newport defendants went to the government and
took that tax deduction, that was a fraud,'' Hansen added.
   But Theodore Wells, attorney for Princeton-Newport managing
partner James Sutton Regan, said the tax trades were ``appropriate,
proper and lawful'' and made in response to changes in federal tax
laws in June 1984.
   ``Each loss involved in this case is a real loss,'' he said.
   In another alleged scheme, Hansen claimed Newberg, with the help
of the Princeton-Newport defendants, illegally drove down the stock
price of C.O.M.B. Co. in 1985 before a Drexel offering of $25
million in bonds to the Minneapolis-based merchandiser. Hansen did
not explain the motivation for the alleged scheme.
   Hansen also told the jury of nine women and three men that the
alleged bogus stock ``parking'' trades also involved Merrill Lynch &
Co. and Akroyd &amp; Smithers Securities. Those two firms cooperated
with the government. They were not charged.
   In an illegal ``parking'' deal, one party agrees to purchase a
block of stock under an agreement to sell it back at a prearranged
time and price, usually to skirt federal tax or stock ownership
disclosure laws.
   In addition to Newberg and Regan, on trial are Jack Z.
Rabinowitz, Charles M. Zarzecki and Paul A. Berkman, all partners in
the investment firm; and Steven B. Smotorick, Princeton-Newport's
comptroller.
   Hansen said prosecutors would play tapes of conversations between
Newberg and Princeton-Newport employees discussing the alleged
illegal deals. The tapes, made as part of normal Princeton-Newport
business activities, were seized during a raid on the firm's
headquarters in December 1987.
   Hansen said one tape contains Newberg telling Zarzecki after the
latter made a C.O.M.B transaction in April 1985: ``You're a
sleaze-bag.''
   ``You taught me, man,'' Zarzecki is said to reply on the tape.
   ``Welcome to the world of being a sleaze,'' Newberg said,
according to Hansen.
   Much of the evidence in the Princeton-Newport case also is
expected to be used against Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk
bond department, who was charged in March in a separate 98-count
racketeering indictment. Newberg also is charged in that case.
   The charges against Milken include dealings he allegedly had with
Princeton-Newport, which was based in Princeton, N.J., and Newport
Beach, Calif., and went out of business shortly after its officials
were indicted last August.
   Hansen conceded that none of the defendants made any money in the
alleged illegal deals, but attributed that to accountants' errors.
He said that fact did not exonerate the men.
   The Princeton-Newport trial is the first in which the
racketeering statute, which carries heavy sentences, fines and
forfeiture of alleged illicit profits upon conviction, has been used
against officials of a securities firm.

<HEAD>Tyson Increases Bid For Holly Farms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WOODY BAIRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest
poultry processor, pressed its attempt Tuesday to take over Holly
Farms Corp. by raising a tender offer for Holly stock to $70 a
share, a bid worth more than $1.2 billion.
   Tyson of Springdale, Ark., has been trying to take over Holly
Farms since last October, and the Memphis-based Holly has been
struggling since November to merge with ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb.
   ``We are delighted that Tyson has now decided to raise its bid,''
Holly Farms lawyer Kenneth Nachbar said in a letter to the Delaware
Chancery Court that has refereed the Tyson-Holly-ConAgra squabble.
   ``We do expect the Holly Farms board to meet within the next five
business days to consider the proposal,'' Nachbar said.
   Holly urged its 5,500 shareholders to hold on to their 18.1
million shares until the company's board meets to review the latest
Tyson bid.
   In raising its tender offer from $63.50, Tyson also said its new
bid was no longer conditioned on removal of an asset sales agreement
established late last year between Holly and ConAgra.
   That agreement is at the heart of a legal fight launched by Tyson.
   The latest merger proposal for ConAgra and Holly Farms was
announced May 20 and is based on a stock swap, while Tyson's bid is
for cash.
   Holly and ConAgra expect to call shareholder votes next month on
their proposed merger. When the proposal was announced, Holly said
it was worth $74 a share based on market prices at the time. The
Delaware court has been told, however, that the offer likely would
be worth around $68 a share by the time the agreement could be
settled.
   In addition to raising its offer, Tyson also filed a court
petition Tuesday seeking to force Holly to dissolve a shareholder
rights plan containing a ``poison pill'' aimed at making a takeover
more costly for an aggressor.
   Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett rejected a similar Tyson attack
on that plan June 14 while clearing the way for shareholder votes on
the proposed merger.
   The shareholder rights plan, adopted in October, would give Holly
stockholders a price break on additional shares in the event of a
takeover.
   The battle for Holly Farms began last year when Tyson offered a
deal valued at $49.50 a share through a cash and stock swap.
   Holly managers rejected that offer as insufficient and have
pointed out several times during the ensuing takeover attempt that
their resistance has raised the amount of money their stockholders
will make if the company is sold.
   ConAgra's original merger offer called for swapping 1.875 shares
of ConAgra stock for each Holly Farms share traded. The current
proposal calls for a swap of 2.1 shares.
   Tyson Foods processes 16.5 million chickens a week and has
announced expansion plans to push that to 17.5 million by the end of
next month.
   Holly Farms is a diversified company heavily involved in fresh
chicken sales. ConAgra is a diversified company specializing in food
and agricultural services.

<HEAD>Milken Heads Magazine's List Of Highest 1988 Earners On Wall Street</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indicted financier Michael Milken was the highest
paid Wall Street professional in 1988, earning more than $180
million as part-time junk bond chieftain for Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., according to estimates compiled by Financial World magazine.
   Milken's earnings combined with the 1988 income of the rest of
Wall Street's top 10 earners totaled nearly $1 billion, exceeding
the gross national product of some small countries, Financial World
said Tuesday in releasing its ``Wall Street 100'' list to be
published in its July 11 edition.
   Milken was one of two executives in the top 10 _ along with
Singer Co. Chairman Paul Bilzerian _ indicted or convicted this year
for securities laws violations.
   Bilzerian, the takeover strategist who was convicted June 9 for
securities fraud unrelated to his 1986 takeover of Singer, was sixth
on the list with estimated earnings of at least $80 million last
year.
   Gordon Cain, chairman of the petrochemical concern Sterling
Group, was second on the list with $120 million. No. 3 was Henry
Kravis, partner in the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
&amp; Co., who earned ``at least'' $110 million, the magazine stated.
   Financial World said its estimates were based on more than three
months of research of company documents and interviews of company
sources.
   Together, the 100 highest paid people on Wall Street earned $2.5
billion last year, the magazine said.
   Rounding out the top 10 were Kohlberg Kravis partner George
Roberts, with $110 million; investor Robert Bass, of the Bass
brothers of Texas, more than $100 million; Irwin Jacobs, the
investor who heads conglomerate Minstar Inc., more than $75 million;
Michel David-Weill, top partner of the investment bank Lazard Freres
&amp; Co. in New York, Paris and London, more than $65 million; Peter
Peterson, chairman of the investment firm Blackstone Group, at least
$50 million; and investor Richard Rainwater, more than $50 million.
   Last year's No. 1, commodities trader Paul Tudor Jones II, fell
to number 19 as his earnings dropped from an estimated $80 million
to about $30 million, the magazine stated.
   Financial World said 1988's takeover frenzy helped enrich most of
those on the 100 list. The lowest earner was Thomas Connors, the
chief West Coast salesman of preferred stock for Drexel, whose
estimated income was $7 million.
   This year's median earner made $15 million, the magazine said.
That was triple last year's $5 million median _ but only about as
much as Milken earned in a month.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. put its four
Sea World parks and two other attractions on the market Tuesday to
help extricate itself from a $2.5 billion debt brought on by a 1987
hostile takeover attempt.
   The company said selling the marine parks in Florida, Texas, Ohio
and California and Boardwalk &amp; Baseball and Cypress Gardens in
central Florida was the best way to meet debt obligations and
concentrate on its publishing and insurance divisions.
   Estimates of the value of the properties ranged from $1 billion
to $2.5 billion.
   Wall Street applauded the move. HBJ's stock closed up $3.75 a
share Tuesday to $13.87{ in active trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   ``It's a positive development for the company because of its weak
balance sheet,'' said Robert Dunlap, a securities analyst with Brown
Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. in New York. ``Clearly, something had to be
done.''
   Elizabeth Bramwell, of the New York firm Gabelli &amp; Co., said HBJ
``shouldn't have been doing all these (other) things. The first love
of this company is publishing.''
   HBJ, the nation's largest textbook publisher, has struggled with
a $2.9 billion recapitalization program over the past two years by
disposing of trade-magazine and school-supply interests,
streamlining its parks division and reshuffling its publishing
operations _ all of which included huge reductions in personnel.
   HBJ restructured its operations, through bank loans and high-risk
junk bonds, to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by British
publisher Robert Maxwell in 1987.
   The decision to sell the theme parks and real estate holdings
followed recent talks between HBJ's longtime chairman, William
Jovanovich, and the company's new president, Ralph D. Caulo,
according to a three-paragraph statement by HBJ.
   ``The HBJ directors have authorized this sale, which is subject
to the approval of HBJ's lenders,'' the announcement said.
   It added that Caulo ``is prepared to leave HBJ in order to manage
these businesses under new ownership.''
   The parks will be sold as a package to an investor that ``wants
to invest in them and continue to see them grow,'' Bob Evanson, head
of the theme parks division, said in an interview.
   Evanson said the company had spoken to ``quite a few'' potential
buyers of the parks, which brought in an estimated $388 million in
revenue last year, and a separate tract of land near Orlando
International Airport.
   Among the possible buyers mentioned by analysts, however, were:
Anheuser-Busch Cos., which owns Busch Gardens in Tampa; British
entertainment magnate Robert Earl, who has restaurant and nightclub
properties in the area; Paramount Studios, which reportedly is
interested in Boardwalk &amp; Baseball; and the prosperous Walt Disney
Co., which just opened its third theme park in the Orlando area.
   HBJ's trade-magazine and school-supply operations were sold to
Edgell Communications Inc. for $334 million in late 1987. That was
the beginning of the effort to repay some of the debt associated
with the costly takeover defense.
   HBJ lost $126.5 million last year compared with a 1987 profit of
$64.4 million, or $1.34 a share.
   The company paid about $313 million in interest last year.

   Paramount Communications Inc., pursuing Time
Inc. with a a $10.7 billion takeover bid, has asked federal
regulators to set aside rulings allowing Time to transfer control of
its cable TV systems to the company Time wants to create by buying
Warner Communications Inc.
   Lawyers for Warner, meanwhile, argued that Paramount's plans for
creating a voting trust to take temporary custody of Time stock
violates cable laws that give local authorities the right to approve
transfers of cable licenses.
   The filings at the Federal Communications Commission were the
latest round in the manueverings over whether Paramount can acquire
Time or whether Time buys Warner in deals that would create the
world's largest entertainment and media conglomerate.
   Lawyers for Paramount said in documents filed with the FCC that
Time had misrepresented to Time stockholders the nature of the
transfer of control.
   Paramount also said Time had written to state attorneys general
asking them to oppose Paramount's proposal without notifying
Paramount of the letters.
   These actions ``raise substantial and material questions about
Time's character qualifications,'' Paramount said in asking the FCC
to set aside its previous approval of the license transfers pending
an FCC investigation.
   Time and Warner announced in March they had agreed to merge in a
stock swap, and proceeded to secure appropriate regulatory
clearances.
   Paramount launched its hostile bid for Time on June 6, just 17
days before Time and Warner shareholders were to have voted on the
merger.
   Time rejected Paramount's offer and revised its merger agreement
with Warner to call for a $14 billion tender offer for Warner.
   The battle is expected to be waged in court in Delaware, where
all three companies are incorporated.
   Paramount earlier this month asked the FCC for permission to
deposit any Time shares it may acquire in a voting trust that would
be headed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld pending FCC
approval of the transfer of 99 cable television franchises and
licenses held by Time's 82-percent-owned subsidiary, American
Television and Communications Corp.
   Art Harding, an attorney for Warner in Washington, said Tuesday
that Paramount's request ``would violate the recent cable act
because Rumsfeld hasn't gotten consent from any of these cities for
the transfers.''
   Harding, echoing assertions Time made in a June 13 filing with
the FCC, said Paramount's plan would ``undermine the delicate
balance'' established in the 1984 Cable Act for regulation of cable
systems by local authorities.
   Warner asked the FCC late Monday to deny the application made by
Paramount for expedited consent for the trust arrangement for
temporary custody of any Time shares that Paramount acquires.
   Warner said Paramount's plan called for an ``unprecedented
extension'' to the cable TV industry of FCC rules that cover hostile
tender offers for broadcast licenses.
   ``Such an extension of the FCC tender offer policy would
emasculate the significant role in cable franchising mandated for
local authorities by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984,''
Warner said.
   Warner also said, among other things, that Paramount's plan was
faulty because Rumsfeld was being paid $250,000 and thus was not an
independent trustee; that a voting trust was invalid because Time's
cable systems were affiliated with Paramount's Madison Square Garden
and USA networks; and that Paramount might end up owning TV and
cable systems in the same region in violation of federal
cross-ownership regulations.
   ``Paramount's so-called tender offer is so riddled with
conditions, loopholes and escape hatches as to be essentially
illusory,'' Warner said.

<TEXT>
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L.
William Seidman, who would become the new deposit insurance czar
under legislation moving through Congress, is talking to the
Treasury Department about an idea that would enhance his power over
the savings and loan bailout.
   Seidman is angling for greater authority over the Resolution
Trust Corp., a new entity that will be created to close or merge
insolvent savings and loan institutions and dispose of real estate
repossessed by the S&amp;Ls, said a well-informed industry official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The FDIC chairman is said to be proposing that his own
organization's board, rather than a single person, be appointed
chief executive officer of the Resolution Trust Corp.
   Seidman, in a telephone interview Tuesday, declined to say his
agency is advocating the idea, but he described it as ``worth
exploring'' and ``feasible.''
   ``It's not our idea. It came from a suggestion that the GAO (the
congressional General Accounting Office) made. We have been talking
to Treasury about it,'' he said.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., under legislation that passed the
House last week and the Senate in April, will have the mammoth task
of spending $50 billion in new bailout funds and of handling $300
billion to $500 billion of bad loans and property.
   The legislation does not spell out how the Resolution Trust Corp.
will be structured beyond the composition of its board, which will
be headed by the Treasury secretary, and the fact that it must hire
a chief executive officer.
   The FDIC is getting the job of insuring savings and loan
deposits, in addition to the commercial bank deposits it already
guarantees. However, the FDIC's relationship to the Resolution Trust
Corp. is left unclear.
   Treasury officials have said they envision the Resolution Trust
Corp. as an oversight agency, with fewer than 100 employees, which
would hire others to do its work. Presumably, the FDIC, because it
has already taken over the 221 worst S&amp;Ls and has the largest pool
of experienced real estate liquidators in the government, would be
the biggest contractor, with private firms also getting pieces of
the work.
   However, Seidman has said he does not want his agency to get
expanded responsibility without added authority to control the
conditions and terms under which it does the additional work.
   Seidman said if the FDIC were not given the added authority, and
were simply a contractor of the Resolution Trust Corp., it would
want to pick and choose what S&amp;L liquidation work it wanted.
   ``We can contract to do what we think is good for (our) agency to
do and we wouldn't have responsibility for the overall operation. We
would contract to do such jobs as were attractive to both sides,''
he said.
   However, that would probably require the administration to make
the Resolution Trust Corp. a larger and more complex bureaucracy
than it now wants.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary David W. Mullins said the
administration has planned all along for the FDIC to take the lead
role in disposing of failed S&amp;Ls. At issue, he said, is the vigor of
administration oversight. The administration sees the Resolution
Trust Corp.'s chief executive officer as a ``full-time oversight
officer,'' he said.
   ``No one likes the idea of a full-time person overseeing them.
But our view is we're required to have oversight,'' he said. The
FDIC ``wants as much independence as (it) can get, but there's a
limit as to what can be done on that.''
   He said the administration is working to more precisely define
the RTC-FDIC relationship in time for a definition to be included in
S&amp;L legislation, which is expected to be on President Bush's desk by
early August, following a House-Senate conference and final
congressional approval in July.
   Joseph E. Roberts Jr., who owns an Alexandria, Va., real estate
liquidation firm which has worked for the FDIC, said there are two
factions within the agency.
   One is composed of FDIC veterans ``who don't appear interested in
taking on this enormous problem.'' The other faction, he said,
consists of ``the future Donald Trumps of the world'' who want to
expand the agency.
   ``I think Seidman is with the young Turks,'' the industry
official said.

<HEAD>Jurors Side With Jack Daniel's In Lemonade Mix Retrial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retrial of a $13 million lawsuit over a
Jack Daniel's drink recipe for Lynchburg Lemonade concluded Tuesday
with a jury verdict in favor of the whiskeymaker's parent firm.
   Former Huntsville lounge owner Tony Mason filed suit, claiming
ownership of the recipe. But a Madison County Circuit Court jury
deliberated just 40 minutes before ruling in favor of Brown Forman
Distillers Corp. and against Mason.
   Mason first sued over the Lynchburg Lemonade recipe in 1983, but
the first trial ended with the jury awarding him only $1 when the
judge instructed the panel it could only consider nominal damages.
An appeals court then ruled punitive damages could also be
considered, setting the stage for this month's retrial.
   Jurors quickly left the courtroom after jury foreman Roy Willis
reported the verdict around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, ending a week of
testimony involving dozens of witnesses and more than 125 items
submitted as evidence.
   Mason contended a Jack Daniel's salesman, Winston Randle, visited
his lounge in 1982 and promised him the company might use Mason and
his band in a promotion if it decided to use the recipe.
   Attorneys for Brown Forman and Randle conceded Randle visited
Mason. But they said the version of Mason's recipe that Randle
received at Mason's nightclub and turned over to company officials
called for the use of lemon juice instead of the sweet-and-sour mix
used in Jack Daniel's whisky promotions.
   The company argued that Mason didn't have a trade secret on the
drink recipe anyway, because he didn't do much to protect the recipe
other than inform employees ``not to tell anyone.''
   But according to testimony, some 25 employees at Mason's lounge,
including a dishwasher, knew the formula.
   Jack Daniel's claimed the final recipe for Lynchburg Lemonade was
a product of Martha Bisio Lasseter, a company ``mixologist.''
   Mason left the courtroom without comment. His attorney, Jerry
Barksdale, gave no indication of a further appeal.
   ``This is something we've worked on for six years and put a lot
of hours and efforts in. I really believed in the case. I'm
disappointed,'' Barksdale said.
   A top executive for Brown Forman, the parent company of Jack
Daniel's, which was among the original defendants, expressed delight
at the verdict.

<TEXT>
   A religious group that plans to target one or
more advertisers for a boycott based on the television shows the
companies sponsor said Tuesday they plan to announce their selection
July 17.
   The group, Christian Leaders for Responsible Television or
Clear-TV, said it is analyzing data collected during from the recent
TV sweeps period to compose its list.
   Billy Melvin, executive director of the National Association of
Evangelicals and chairman of the group, said the data was collected
by about 3,000 people watching TV in 33 states.
   He said network advertisers were asked three times before the
sweeps period, April 27 through May 24, to be responsible in the
placement of their commercials by avoiding programs with gratuitous
sex, violence, profanity and anti-Christian stereotyping.
   Some industry watchers say efforts in the early 1980s to boycott
advertisers failed. But advertisers have in recent months cancelled
ad plans following complaints from some individuals or groups
unhappy with the content of programs such as NBC's ``Saturday Night
Live'' and the Fox television network's ``Married ... with
Children.''
   Clear-TV, based in Wheaton, Ill., says it is a coalition of 1,600
Christian leaders with constituencies totaling 60 million people.

<HEAD>Crazy Eddie Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDISON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crazy Eddie Inc., the flamboyant electronics
retailer, filed for protection from creditors Tuesday under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy code but pledged to keep its stores
open.
   Five creditors had filed a petition for involuntary bankruptcy
against Crazy Eddie on June 6, seeking to recover $860,000.
   The company initially said it would fight to have the filing
dismissed. But Peter A. Martosella, acting president and chief
executive officer, said the petition caused a series of problems
that forced Crazy Eddie to seek protection.
   ``The action of the five creditors, which we believe was ill
advised, caused a disruption in our bank credit facility and related
business and cash flow problems requiring the company to seek the
protection afforded it under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code,'' he
said in a statement.
   Martosella said the company had been negotiating an out-of-court
debt restructuring with its creditors.
   ``We believe that the Crazy Eddie name remains a strong consumer
franchise,'' Martosella said.
   The filing, made in U.S Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, will not
affect operations at Crazy Eddie's 26 stores in New Jersey, New
York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, the company said.
   The retailer, known for its frenetic broadcast commercials and
claims that ``Our prices are insane,'' closed 17 of its 43 stores in
March in a bid to cut its losses.
   The company said it had been drained of its working capital by a
drop in sales compounded by inventory shortages, long-term debt and
unprofitable locations.
   In filing to force an involuntary bankruptcy reorganization, the
five creditors claimed Crazy Eddie was liquidating its assets
without taking into account its debts. They also said negotiations
on repayment had collapsed.
   The petition was filed by the Cobra Electronics Group, a division
of Dynasca Corp.; Phonemate, Inc.; Code-A-Phone Corp.; Southwestern
Bell Telecommunications Inc.; and Northwestern Bell Phones, an
affiliate of U S West Inc.

   MAI Basic Four Inc., which is pursuing a

and chief executive officer, William B. Patton Jr., would resign to
pursue personal and business interests.
   Patton, whose resignation takes effect Sunday, will be

previously was president.
   Patton will remain on the board and continue to serve as a
consultant, the company said.
   MAI Basic Chairman Bennett LeBow, who launched the billion-dollar
takeover bid for Natick, Mass.-based Prime in November, said in a
news release that Patton intended to ``devote more time to his other
personal and business interests.''
   MAI Basic is offering $19.50 a share cash for 75 percent of
Prime's stock, plus securities with a face value of $21 a share for
the remaining 25 percent. The cash portion of the bid is worth $975
million. Analysts believe the securities would trade at below face
value.

   Delegates to the United Auto Workers
convention turned aside Tuesday an attempt to limit joint
labor-management programs at auto plants, dealing a dissident group
its third major defeat in as many days.
   In a show-of-hands vote, delegates to the union's triennial
constitutional convention rejected a move that would have forced the
international union to support locals that oppose the team
management style.
   The so-called jointness resolution is a cornerstone of the
disagreement between the New Directions movement and the UAW's
leadership.
   The dissidents claim the joint programs endanger jobs and rob the
union of its strength. The Administration Caucus, which represents
the union's administration, contends that change in the workplace is
necessary, and that New Directions supporters don't recognize that.
   ``It makes me wonder where they (dissidents) have been in the
last 15 years,'' delegate John Nolan of Local 1895 in Broken Arrow,
Okla., area said during debate on the matter.
   But New Directions member Frank Hammer, president of Local 909 in
Warren, Mich., said the joint programs represent a union-breaking
strategy.
   ``I submit to you that jointness is their attempt to co-opt our
union,'' he said.
   The joint labor-management programs grew out of the auto
industry's slump in the early 1980s and the threat of foreign
competition.
   The New Directions effort also suggested that the union abandon
its seat on the Chrysler Corp. board of directors, now held by union
President Owen Bieber.
   Bieber bristled at the suggestion. ``It's a lonely place on that
board ... but it's the only voice of the workers,'' he said.
   After the loss, Jerry Tucker of St. Louis, the leader of the New
Directions movement, said he thought the debate was worthwhile and
that he hoped delegates would return to their locals and talk about
the convention with the rank and file.
   ``The rank and file ultimately will find ways to express
themselves,'' he said.
   Tucker declined to say exactly how or when that expression may
come. He did say he expected there would be a New Directions
presence at UAW prebargaining meetings next year. The UAW's
contracts with the Big Three automakers expire on Sept. 14, 1990.
   Before the debate, the third day of the convention got off to a
loud start as a parade of dissidents marched into the hall, waving
signs and shouting.
   It was the first organized demonstration during the convention by
New Directions forces, the strongest voice opposing UAW leadership
in 40 years.
   New Directions, which has about 20 percent of the delegates in
its corner, lost votes on two other major issues it brought to the
convention.
   One involved a credentials fight over certain delegates from UAW
regions in the Southwest and metropolitan Detroit. The other would
have required that the union abandon its practice of electing top
national officers at conventions and substitute for it a national
referendum of the rank and file.

   Home Shopping Network lost $400 million
in profits because its telephone equipment was inadequate to handle
the volume of calls, an attorney said Tuesday.
   The hefty loss was suffered over a 14-month period as the St.
Petersburg-based television retail giant went through a huge spurt
of growth, Chet Kamin, a lawyer for HSN, told a jury.
   GTE Corp. and its subsidiaries knew about the problems _ that a
staggering number of calls were not getting through _ but lied to
the company and persuaded HSN instead to buy even more equipment to
try to resolve the dilemma, he said.
   ``Home Shopping's like Mother's Day, every day,'' said Kamin,
referring to the high number of calls from viewers who may only
purchase items while they are being displayed on the screen.
   ``What happened as a result of GTE blocking calls and not telling
us is that we lost millions and millions of calls,'' Kamin said in
opening statements.
   A jury of five women and one man was seated Tuesday in a $1.5
billion battle between the corporate giants, HSN and GTE Corp.
   HSN sued GTE Florida, its parent GTE Corp., and other subsidaries
in 1987, alleging a number of misdeeds linked to what it claimed was
inadequate service and faulty phone equipment.
   GTE Florida and its parent company, a multibillion-dollar
telecommunications firm based in Stamford, Conn., have denied any
wrongdoing and said there was nothing wrong with their equipment.
They filed a countersuit alleging slander and libel and claimed that
HSN executives engaged in a ``blame the telephone company scheme to
mask HSN's poor market and financial performance ...''
   GTE counsel Roy Reardon told the jury that HSN's charges were
``absolutely baseless.''
   HSN had 4 million subscribers when it talked to GTE about
telephone service in 1985, Reardon said. That grew to 9 million by
August 1986, and one year later the number skyrocketed to 46.5
million, he said.
   Sales soared from $11 million in 1985 to $582 million by August
1987 _ all with the GTE telephone network in place, he said.
   ``We don't believe you just cover your own problems of
mismanagement ... by blaming other people. There was no fraud ... no
coverup,'' Reardon said.
   HSN's original 12-count complaint has been reduced to four
charges _ fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and
confidence and breach of fiduciary duty.
   Pinellas Circuit Judge Howard Rives combined both suits in what
is expected to be a six-week trial.
   Although there are no phone company records showing the precise
number of calls in question, Home Shopping expects to show evidence
that 42 million calls were not completed betweeen February 1986 and
April 1987, Kamin said.
   He added that not all lost calls would have translated into sales.
   Kamin presented what he said was an internal GTE memo that noted
as many as 26,000 overflow calls in a one-hour period.
   The in-house document asks what are GTE subsidiaries
responsibilities to the customer and the efficiency of his service,
and notes that HSN ``is not aware that its calls are restricted.''
   ``It was in a sense a disaster waiting to happen,'' Kamin told
the six-member jury and five alternates.
   After April 1987 surveys showed HSN was losing 50 percent of its
calls the company switched carriers to MCI Communications Corp.,
Kamin said, adding the call completion rate now is over 90 percent.

   The U.S. dollar held firm against the Japanese yen
Friday morning, while stock prices shed about half their early gains.
   The dollar was changing hands at 144.80 yen at late morning.
After opening at 144.85 yen, up 1.05 yen from Tuesday's close of
143.80 yen, the currency ranged from 144.73 to 144.95 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 220.29 points
Tuesday, lost 56.05 points, or 0.16 percent, to finish the morning
session at 33,177.42. The index gained 111.22 points during the
early morning session.
   Kinji Ishizuka, of Daiwa Securities Co., a major Japanese
brokerage, said the market experienced ``strong buying at the start,
but later weakening with many investors taking a wait-and-see
position'' in the absence of major market-affecting news.
   ``The market is not now reacting too much even if exchange rates
fluctuate at a margin of one yen or so,'' Ishizuka said.
   In the currency market, traders said the dollar was firm during
the morning session following its overnight firmness in overseas
markets.
   ``Investors still want to invest in dollar assets, but it fell so
suddenly last week that they cannot buy it up too aggressively,''
said a dealer of a major Japanese bank, who spoke anonymously.
   The dollar fluctuated wildly last week, with the currency closing
Thursday at 151.30 yen, its highest level in almost two years. The
dollar fell 6.25 yen Friday.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Lifts Order Restraining Trump's Bid to Buy Casino</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge lifted a
restraining order Tuesday that temporarily blocked Donald Trump's
$63 million bid to purchase Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel in
Atlantic City.
   But the deal for the financially-troubled gaming hall still faces
several obstacles, attorneys involved in the case say.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rosemary Gambardella scheduled a hearing
for June 28 to consider Trump's bid to purchase the boardwalk
property, said Arthur Sklar, an attorney representing Donald J.
Trump Acqusitions Corp., which is handling the purchase.
   The judge imposed the restraining order Monday at the request of
creditors who hold a $6.5 million mortage on three Atlantis parking
lots. They complained of not receiving adequate notice of details of
the purchase agreement, which was announced a day after the casino's
gaming license expired in April.
   Sklar said attorneys for Elsinore Shore Associates, which amassed
debts estimated at $150 million while running the casino, asked the
judge to lift the restraining order. The judge ordered creditors to
explain why the Trump deal should not be approved, said Sklar.
   Edward J. DiDonato, an attorney who represents the creditors, was
not in his office Tuesday afternoon. He has said he wants the court
to seek additional bids for the Atlantis.
   Michael Griffinger, an Atlantis attorney, did not return a
message left at his office.
   Sklar said Trump believes he is paying too much for the Atlantis
and may ask Ms. Gambardella to reduce his purchase price. Trump
plans to close the casino and convert it into a luxury hotel.
