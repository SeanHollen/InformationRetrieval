   A woman spearfishing off the Bahamas lost her right
hand Wednesday in an apparent shark attack when she was surfacing
with a speared fish in her hand, authorities said.
   Judy St. Clair, 31, a diving instructor from Marathon, was
attacked while snorkeling with friends and her parents off Highborn
Cay near Great Exuma Island, about 220 miles southeast of Miami,
said Coast Guard Petty Officer Steven Sapp.
   Ms. St. Clair was treated on the scene by a Miami plastic
surgeon who was boating nearby and heard the group's distress call.
She then was airlifted by the Coast Guard to Nassau and on to Miami
for more extensive medical treatment.
   Officials at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital said they didn't
know until Ms. St. Clair arrived that her hand had actually been
bitten off in the attack.
   ``The hand is gone,'' said nurse Jeanne Eckes, Jackson's trauma
center coordinator. ``It's an amputation above the wrist. The
injury itself actually goes to the wrist and encompasses the
wrist.''
   ``From the looks of her hand, it was a big animal that did
this,'' Ms. Eckes said. ``We can presume it was a shark attack.''
   Ms. St. Clair underwent surgery Wednesday night to clean the
wound and was listed in stable condition. She will have to undergo
future surgery for ``extensive repair,'' said the nurse, adding
that the severed hand was not recovered.
   ``I think she's in good spirits for what she's been through,
absolutely,'' Ms. Eckes said.
   Authorities said Ms. St. Clair was surfacing by the boat with a
grouper in her hand when a shark grabbed at the fish and her hand,
pulling her down into the water.

   The first performance in the United States of
``The Queen's Suite'' was the news at the thoroughly delightful
concert of Duke Ellington's music in the Classical Jazz at Lincoln
Center series.
   Ellington was presented to Queen Elizabeth II in London in 1959
and promised her, on the spot, that he would write a piece of music
for her. He did. The Ellington Band recorded it and one recording
was pressed, which was sent to the Queen.
   After the composer's death in 1974, the master was used to press
recordings for public sale. But until Wednesday night in Alice
Tully Hall, ``The Queen's Suite'' hadn't been performed in this
country.
   It contains a lovely piano solo, ``The Single Petal of a Rose,''
which Sir Roland Hanna played on Wednesday. His touch isn't the
same as Ellington's but his stylistic approach is right, playing
solo or with the band.
   Soloist hero of the evening was Jimmy Hamilton, 72, who was in
the Ellington Band from 1943 to 1968 and who came from his home in
the Virgin Islands for the concert. He played tenor saxophone and
was a marvel of clarity on clarinet.
   Wynton Marsalis stepped out from the trumpet section to play the
solo on ``Concerto for Cootie,'' which Ellington composed for
Cootie Williams in 1940. Marsalis' dynamics were subtle and
brilliant, from a light line ending in a growl to a plunger mute
line melting into honey.
   Tenor saxophonist Todd Williams, who is in Marsalis' band,
played an eight-minute solo in ``Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue''
and got heads bobbing and hands clapping in the audience. It's
risky to confront a great live-performance event _ as Paul
Gonsalves' suddenly inspired 27 choruses in this piece at the
Newport Jazz Festival in 1956 _ but Williams created the same kind
of excitement.
   The evening began with Ellington's and Billy Strayhorn's
arrangement of ``The Nutcracker,'' which uses ``The Nutcracker
Suite'' as inspiration for witty new compositions. One hears some
of ``The Dance of the Flowers'' in ``Dance of the Floreadores'' but
that's about all that remains of Tchaikovsky.
   David Berger, who conducted the 15-piece band knowledgeably, has
transcribed more than 100 Ellington compositions.
   The band sounded a lot like the Ellington Band, its voicings
smooth and plush as velvet. The band, and the music, sounded
excitingly, brightly brand-new. After encores of ``Jack the Bear''
and ``Take the A Train,'' the audience yelled for more.
   Other musicians were Willie Cook, Norris Turney, Joe Temperley,
Britt Woodman and Jimmy Woode, former members of the Ellington
Band, and Lew Soloff, Marcus Belgrave, Frank Wess, Art Baron, Jimmy
Knepper and Kenny Washington. The concert will be repeated Thursday.

<TEXT>
   A Pacific coast train plunged off a
bridge into a rain-swollen river in northwestern Mexico on
Wednesday, killing at least 85 people and injuring 107, an official
involved in the search said.
   One report said more than 100 people killed when the engine and
two passenger cars fell from the Rio Bamoa bridge, about 50 miles
southeast of Los Mochis and about 730 miles northwest of Mexico
City.
   The bridge collapsed, but it was not clear whether heavy rains
washed parts of it out before the northbound train got there.
   Red Cross and other officials said rescue work was continuing
through the night.
   Most of the victims drowned, said Javier Lopez, the Red Cross
duty officer in Los Mochis. ``They fell into the water and died of
asphyxiation,'' he said.
   The second class train, which is popular with younger U.S.
tourists, was en route from the coastal resort of Mazatlan to
Mexicali, on the California border, said National Railroad official
Ignacio Duran.
   Rail and rescue officials could provide no early breakdown on
any foreign casualties.
   Searchers recovered the bodies after a daylong rescue attempt,
said Manuel Meraz Moreno, chief of radio communications at the
Sinaloa state public security office.
   ``This is confirmed, there are 85 people dead and 107 injured,''
said Meraz Moreno in a telephone interview.
   The government news agency Notimex quoted unidentified police
sources in Los Mochis as saying there were more than 100 dead, but
the report could not be immediately confirmed.
   Meraz said the bodies and the injured were being brought to the
nearby towns of Gusave and Guamuchil.
   Relatives late Wednesday identified the first eight bodies lying
in three funeral parlors in the small town of Guamuchil, a few
miles where the accident occurred. They were all Mexicans.
   Rescue workers said aid efforts had been hampered by heavy rains
in the area. They said a huge rainstorm Tuesday night damaged long
stretches of railbed and blocked roads and highways.
   ``It stopped raining in the late afternoon and this helped a
lot,'' said Abel Roldan, a rescue worker at the village of Bamoa,
11 miles from the crash. News photographers who flew over the scene
said they could see passenger cars lying jumbled, some of them on
their side, in the river at the bottom of a deep ravine.
   ``They are still going through the wreckage. There may be more
victims. We don't know yet,'' Meraz said. He said rescue crews were
working into the night.
   The engine and two of four passenger cars plunged into the river
and two other passenger cars and two mail and cargo cars derailed,
said Duran.
   Lopez, of the Red Cross, said the bridge had been destroyed and
service was suspended on the line, but it was not known if the
bridge was washed out before the train got there.
   Roberto Martinez Maestre, a spokesman for the Sinaloa state
government who is based in Mexico City, said part of the train
plunged down the embankment.
   ``The cause was quite clear. The heavy rains loosened the
railbed and, and the rails just gave way. The train went against
the bridge and down into the river,'' said Martinez, who was in
contact with state officials.
   Maria Eugenia Batista, a Red Cross nurse in Guamachi, said many
passengers suffered minor injuries. Some ``were evacuated in
railway service cars, a few at a time,'' she said.
   Janet Gaxiole Sandoval, a secretary at a social security clinic
in Guasave, said at least 20 of the injured were in serious
condition.
   Los Mochis lies 410 miles south of Nogales, Ariz. Train
derailments and other accidents have been frequent throught Mexico,
especially in the Pacific areawhere railbeds and equipment are old
and rains are frequent and heavy.
   But Wednesday's was by far the most work Mexican train accident
in the past five years.
   On May 4, a passenger train derailed about 400 miles northwest
of Mexico City, killing at least eight people and injuring 50. Two
days earlier, 20 people suffered minor injuries when a passenger
train plowed into a parked locomotive in Mexicali, across the
border from Calexico, Calif.
   On Feb. 25, 22 people died when a bus and train collided near
Saltillo, and another 13 people died in a Jan. 31 bus-train
accident in Ciudad Sahagun.

<TEXT>
   The Hubbard Museum in Ruidoso, N.M., has
announced the creation of an annual competition for the best
painting or sculpture in the realistic or representational style.
   The Hubbard Art Award for Excellence carries a prize of $250,000
and will be presented for the first time in June 1990. The award,
announced Wednesday in New York, was created by R. Dee and Joan
Dale Hubbard of Fort Worth, Texas.
   ``Excellence in art should be recognized and we believe there
are Audubons, Morans, Whistlers, Pyles and Remingtons in the art
world today,'' they said in a statement.
   About 50 artists have been invited to participate in the
competition, and so far 21 have accepted, said John V. Hall,
director of the Hubbard Museum.
   ``Each artist is already considered among the most significant
American masters in order to be invited and we believe the size of
the award will bring greater recognition to the entire genre and
encourage `best of the best' artists to reach for the highest
standards of excellence,'' he said.
   One piece from each artist will be shown at the Hubbard Museum
and other institutions next year. ``This will be by far the most
significant show ever of living American representational and
realism artists,'' Hall said.
   Artists who have agreed to compete include Jamie Wyeth, George
Weymouth, Dean Mitchell and Henry Casselli.

<HEAD>Oak Ridge Resident Gets $4,000 for Einstein Note</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Setting a price on a historical letter
can be a relative thing, particularly when the writer was Albert
Einstein.
   Howard Whetsel of Oak Ridge said Wednesday he is satisfied with
the $4,000 he was paid by a California broker for a 1947 letter he
received from Einstein, the scientist who formulated the theory of
relativity.
   ``I probably could have gotten more, but the letter was getting
fragile,'' said Whetsel, 78, a retired chemist and editor at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory.
   Whetsel said he decided to sell the one-page note because it was
yellowing and he couldn't take care of it properly. ``It's got a
few years left in it,'' he said.
   Profiles in History, a broker in old documents and famous
signatures in Beverly Hills, Calif., bought the letter. Whetsel got
his check last week and the letter has already been resold.
   Joe Maddalena, owner of the brokerage, refused in a telephone
interview Wednesday to say how much he resold the letter for or to
whom. But he said Whetsel ``did very well, I can tell you that. He
should be very happy.''
   Whetsel speculated the $4,000 he received might have covered the
value of Einstein's signature alone, without accounting for the
contents of the letter.
   Maddalena said the price of the letter included what was
actually written in the missive, which he described as ``a good
content letter.''
   Einstein's letters ``are very common,'' he said. ``He wrote
thousands and thousands and thousands of them.''
   For that reason, he said, a signature of Einstein on a
historically insignificant letter would be worth about $1,000
compared to the most valuable Einstein letter, a 1939 message to
President Franklin D. Roosevelt encouraging development of the
atomic bomb. The FDR letter sold for $220,000, Maddalena said.
   Einstein's letter to Whetsel was in response to a letter from
Whetsel, who wanted to sort out some conflicting accounts of the
physicist's beliefs on scientific concepts and theories.
   The question concerned a physics concept that held that a rod
traveling at the speed of light would contract in the direction it
was moving. Some biographies said Einstein depended on this concept
in formulating his special theory of relativity; other biographies
said he didn't.
   Whetsel, who met Einstein at Princeton University while working
on the Manhattan Project, decided to write Einstein directly.
   Einstein, in his letter to Whetsel, essentially said the
question was moot because ``it was found that this contraction is
the consequence of (his own) special theory of relativity so that
no arbitrary hypothesis had to be made with respect to moving solid
bodies.''
   ``That settled it,'' Whetsel said, adding that while he didn't
necessarily agree, ``Who's going to argue with Einstein?''
   Maddalena said he has purchased 20 Einstein letters in the last
three months alone. ``It's like anything else,'' he said, ``as
people find out these things have value, they are selling them.''

<TEXT>
   Now that hundreds of U.S. Navy
sailors have roamed its streets, this restricted Black Sea port
seems to have little left to hide.
   But some residents want Sevastopol kept off-limits anyway _ not
to preserve military secrets, but to keep its supplies of sausage
and other foodstuffs out of the hands of other Soviets.
   ``To talk about military secrets after this visit is absurd,''
said Sergei Koshkin, deputy editor in chief of the local newspaper,
The Glory of Sevastopol. ``But to tell the truth, the population
doesn't want the city opened for purely practical reasons.''
   Sevastopol is one of a number of Soviet cities that remain
off-limits for most Soviet citizens as well as foreigners.
Sometimes the Kremlin's rationale for closing them is unclear, but
in this case, it's obvious: Sevastopol is the home port for the
Soviet navy's Black Sea fleet.
   On Friday, the Americans sailed into Sevastopol to a hero's
welcome, but ordinary Soviets must pass through checkpoints if they
enter by car or have their documents scanned by patrols if they
come by bus or train.
   Officially, only close relatives of residents are allowed in to
visit, and then only for limited periods.
   Residents say the restrictions limit the flow of tourists that
might flood the southern Crimean city of nearly 400,000 people,
and, like vacationers in Yalta and other coastal cities, sweep up
what remains on store shelves.
   Meat, butter and sugar already are rationed in Sevastopol, but
by Soviet standards, things could be much worse. Koshkin said he
was recently in Vladivostok, a strategic port in the Soviet Far
East that was recently opened up, ``and in terms of produce,
there's nothing there _ nothing.''
   As President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms change the way
Soviet farmers and industries do business, the country is suffering
from worsening shortages of food and such basic items as
toothpaste, soap, detergent and medicine. Official statistics say
meat is now rationed in 24 regions of the Russian republic alone,
soap in 30 regions and sugar virtually everywhere.
   Stores in Sevastopol are relatively well-stocked, with shorter
lines than in Moscow, where an estimated 1 million out-of-towners
come daily to shop, swelling store queues and bringing grumbles
from natives.
   Other closed Soviet cities are also reluctant to take down their
walls despite the Kremlin's policy of greater openness, according
to a report Wednesday in the newspaper Socialist Industry.
   In an unidentified space-industry city in Siberia, retirees
offered to pay themselves for patrols to guard the city rather than
allow it to be opened, it said.
   ``It's not hard to understand people,'' the newspaper said.
``It's the psychological comfort that has accumulated over the
years, the stability, the extra defense that's guaranteed by that
high fence.''
   In Sevastopol, residents say that despite existing restrictions,
the summer sunshine brings a surge of tourists who come to enjoy
the hilly city's fresh air, classical architecture, roses and
seaside promenades. They also explore the city's history _ its
record of invaders ranging from the ancient Scythians to the
Germans, and its prolonged sieges during the Crimean War in the
mid-1850s and World War II.
   ``In the winter, you can buy milk freely, but in the summer,
it's all snatched up in the morning,'' said former navy Lt. Valery
Karyakin, who had been based in Sevastopol during his tour of duty
and was preparing to leave.
   Still, Karyakin said, he would have preferred the city be opened
so he could freely invite friends to visit.
   One Sevastopol woman said her parents, who lived two hours away
in Simferopol, were allowed to visit for only one month in summer.
``If they want to visit for even one day in December, they can't,''
she said.
   The restrictions, already somewhat archaic in the face of
modern-day satellite photography, seemed even more pointless after
Western correspondents were given a free rein to wander about and
take pictures during the five-day visit of the U.S. warships. The
cruiser USS Thomas S. Gates and the frigate USS Kauffman left
Sevastopol on Tuesday.
   A picturesque promenade built along the edge of downtown
Sevastopol looks down on inlets where dozens of Soviet submarines,
warships and research vessels are at rest or under repair.
   As two Western photographers focused their long-range lenses on
the display of naval hardware, Soviet passers-by stared
suspiciously and clucked in disapproval, but did not move to stop
them.
   A policeman who checked the journalists' documents let them go
with the mild reprimand that ``it is not desirable to photograph
here.''

   A convicted murderer upset at prison
conditions held another inmate and a prison worker at gunpoint for
9{ hours Wednesday, but released them unharmed and killed himself,
officials said.
   Thomas Walden, 42, fatally shot himself in the neck at 10:26
p.m., about 30 minutes after talking by telephone with his brother,
state Department of Corrections Commissioner Parker Evatt said,
   Walden was armed with a .25-caliber automatic when he
overpowered a guard shortly before his schedule transfer from
McCormick Correctional Institution to another state prison,
Corrections spokesman Francis X. Archibald said.
   Prison officials could not account for how Walden acquired the
pistol, but said they would investigate how it got into the prison.
   Walden took the two hostages around 11:30 a.m. in the prison's
furniture-manufacturing building, Archibald said. He had asked for
his attorney, his prison file and to make a phone call to his wife,
the spokesman said.
   Walden released the inmate hostage at 4:25 p.m. and freed the
prison worker shortly before 9 p.m. after negotiators agreed to let
him telephone members of his family, Archibald said.
   After talking with his brother, Evatt said Walden continued to
speak by telephone with corrections officials, but then walked to
the other end of the and shot himself.
   Although Walden was upset at his impending transfer to Perry
Correctional Institution near Pelzer, Evatt said he never asked to
remain in McCormick and appeared to accept the move later in the
evening.
   Department officials said Walden and another inmate were
reportedly at odds and that in the routine procedure to separate
such prisoners, Walden happened to be the inmate that had to be
moved.
   Archibald said Walden was particularly incensed that he was to
be transferred to what would have been his fourth prison since
November 1984, when he began serving a sentence of life and 24
years for murder and armed robbery.
   Prison officials locked the other prisoners in their cells while
officials negotiated with Walden.
   McCormick, near the Georgia state line about 70 miles west of
Columbia, is a medium- to maximum-security prison that was built as
an 808-bed prison, but has been allowed by the courts to
double-cell some inmates and is at its maximum capacity of 1,100,
Archibald said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They shot Butchy Doe again, and nobody is
surprised.
   He's a convicted bank robber who just got out of jail on a
firearms charge and is a suspect in at least three slayings. Police
say they think this is the fourth attempt to kill him _ and there
may be more they don't know about.
   In May, Arthur L. ``Butchy'' Doe Jr., 30, took three bullets
when armed men stormed his girlfriend's apartment in Charlestown.
She died.
   Somebody called the hospital where Doe was recovering. ``Don't
bother stitching him up because when he gets out we're gonna shoot
him again,'' the man said.
   On Tuesday, Doe was ambushed leaving a deli and carrying a
sandwich and a can of soda. He took a bullet in the chest, but is
expected to live _ for a while.
   On Wednesday, the Boston detective who oversees Charlestown said
police already have everything they need on who is trying to kill
Butchy Doe. Except a witness who will testify.
   ``We know who did it. We know who dunnit last time,'' said Lt.
Detective Edward J. McNelley. ``You gonna come forward and say it's
him? The problem is what we know and what we can prove. The whole
town knows who did it.''
   The people behind the counter at Collier's Meat Deli, where at
least three shots were fired, said they had never heard of Butchy
Doe.
   But a group of 13- and 14-year-old boys hanging around the stoop
next door were happy to point out the spot where Doe dropped his
sandwich on the sidewalk and clutched the center of his chest. The
boys and four other neighbors, all speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they knew who did it.
   Asked why nobody would help the police, one 14-year-old boy
replied, ``If they don't want to look like Butchy Doe, they don't
tell.''
   Busing battles, soaring real estate prices and even
gentrification have done nothing to weaken the old code of loyalty
in Charlestown, a tough Irish neighborhood surrounding Bunker Hill
that McNelley described as ``probably the bank robbery capital of
the world.''
   For years the tight hilly streets have sheltered 50 to 70
professional bank robbers, many of whom were never caught, McNelley
said.
   In the early 1960s, two groups of stickup men got into a fight
over a woman. The story has it that one man spit in the face of
another's girlfriend. McNelley said the resulting gang war lasted
several years and killed at least 56 people.
   ``With these guys, getting shot is just a way of life,''
McNelley said.
   McNelley said he didn't know the trigger for the latest round of
shooting and retaliation, but cocaine, heroin and angel dust are
believed to be a factor.
   Neighbors, speaking on condition of anonymity, offered a number
of other explanations.
   One theory has it that both attacks on Doe are the fallout from
the armed robbery of $254,000 from a bank inside Massachusetts
General Hospital in early May. The person who wouldn't allow
himself to be identified and who claimed to be a relative of Doe,
said the hard feelings began when Doe drove away in the getaway car
and later refused to share the money. The robbery has not been
solved and Doe was never charged.
   Another story has it that 10 years ago Doe was blamed for a
murder. ``Rather than going to the police, they took the law into
their own hands. They beat him up, real bad, yeah. He's always had
kind of a resentment about that.''
   A taxi driver described Doe as homely man with dirty blond hair
and deep-set eyes who favors high-top sneakers, football shirts and
always wears a cap. He's been seen often near a housing project
carrying a bag that some believe contains a gun.
   ``He's a very vicious person,'' the driver said. ``He's been in
so much trouble over the years. The cops don't really care if he

   A boy who identified himself as Doe's nephew, 13-year-old Richie
Doe, said his uncle told family members he expected to be out of

<HEAD>State Cites Rocky Flats on Residue Storage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Colorado, asserting its regulatory
authority over a federal hazardous waste reprocessing program, has
cited the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant for allegedly storing
plutonium-containing residues without a permit.
   Gov. Roy Romer told reporters on Wednesday the state Health
Department has ordered Rocky Flats to provide a schedule for
developing an ``accurate description of the nature, source and
location'' of the hazardous residue stored in barrels.
   The conflict with the plant, operated by Rockwell International
for the Department of Energy, stems from stored material that may
be reprocessed _ over which the state has no authority _ and
material exceeding the 1,601 cubic yard limit that must be shipped
out of the state for permanent storage elsewhere.
   The department also required a plan for bringing the residue
storage into compliance with hazardous waste requirements.
   The schedule and plan are required within 30 days of receipt of
the violation notice or plant officials may be subjected to a fine
to be determined later.
   The materials have been stored at the plant for some time for
the recovery of plutonium, a component used in the manufacturing of
nuclear weapon triggers, the plant's main production item.
   Rocky Flats officials, who had no immediate comment about the
state's action, claimed the residues are exempted from regulation
because they will be recycled. The state argues that some of the
residues are not subject to that exemption.
   Eventually, based on more information the state is demanding DOE
to submit, the state will determine the most appropriate way to
manage the wastes.
   Dowsett said some of the barrels of residues which do not
contain enough plutonium to justify the expense of recovering it,
should be handled as waste, under the law that applies to hazardous
waste.
   But some of the barrels with economically recoverable levels of
plutonium need to be managed as hazardous wastes.

   An Air Force cargo plane crashed
Wednesday while attempting to drop equipment during a training
exercise at Fort Bragg, killing one crew member and injuring six
others, authorities said.
   Seven people were aboard the C-130 Hercules from the 463
Tactical Airlift Wing based at Dyess Air Force Base near Abilene,
Texas. The aircraft crashed about 7 p.m. at the Sicily Drop Zone on
the Army base.
   ``The aircraft did break up and the fuel cells ruptured,'' Pope
Air Force Base Fire Chief W.B. Bell Jr. said, adding that
firefighters took one hour to extinguish the blaze.
   None of the crewmembers was identified. They were taken to Fort
Bragg's Womack Army Community Hospital, said Capt. Brian Irving,
chief of public affairs for Pope Air Force Base and 317th Tactical
Airlift. Hospital officials declined to release information on the
conditions of the injured.
   All on board were Air Force personnel, but it was unclear
whether all were from Dyess Air Force Base, officials said.
   The Fayetteville Times said the aircraft was attempting to drop
a 36,000-pound armoured reconnaissance vehicle rigged with a
parachute, when the crash occurred at the south side of the drop
zone. The vehicle was still aboard the plane when it crashed, and
began burning from a fuel fire.
   The four-engine aircraft went down in a barren clay and sandy
area surrounded by trees that is used by Fort Bragg and Pope Force
Base primarily for parachute drops.
   The aircraft was flying in support of the 82nd Airborne
Division's 3rd Battalion, 73rd Armor Regiment, said Lt. Col. Ned
Longsworth, chief of public affairs for Fort Bragg and 18th
Airborne Corps.
   A board of Military Airlift Command officials will investigate
the accident and was expected to arrive at Pope early Thursday,
officials said.
   The crash fatality was the first at Fort Bragg since July 1,
1987, when five service members died as a C-130 crashed and burned
before more than 4,000 spectators during a capabilities exercise.
   Four Pope Air Force Base crew members and a Fort Bragg soldier
on the ground died in the accident, which occurred as the airplane
was attempting to drop a tank.

   Pittsburgh Steelers Coach Chuck Noll led a
new team on the practice field Wednesday night, but this time he
was the nervous rookie as conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra.
   Noll conducted the 101-member orchestra in John Philip Sousa's
``The Stars and Stripes Forever.''
   The orchestra played before about 5,000 people at the Steelers'
summer camp at St. Vincent College as a tribute to Steelers founder
Arthur J. Rooney Sr., who died Aug. 25, 1988, at age 87.
   Noll, 57, who won four Super Bowls in the 1970s, quickly relaxed
as he led the orchestra to the rousing march, delicately handling
his baton, making faces at the violinists and occasionally
imitating the trombonists.
   Noll, who wore his game attire _ a white Steelers's golf shirt
and black trousers _ said the experience was easier than coaching
his other team.
   ``That's what happens when you have a good team,'' he said.
``There was nothing to it. It was good fun.''
   At the intermission of the outdoor concert, Noll was seen
backstage taking lessons on waving the baton from the symphony's
conductor, Andreas Delfs.
   ``He did wonderfully,'' Delfs said after Noll's performance.
``He's very musical, perfect tempo. He's a real American, so he hit
the real tempo.''

   Cristina Ferrare says she worked so hard during
her last pregnancy that she could ``hardly wait to go into labor so
I could rest.''
   Ms. Ferrare was working as a host of three television shows
while pregnant with her fourth child, her second daughter with
entertainment executive Tony Thomopoulos. She had two children with
her ex-husband, automaker John DeLorean.
   ``I could hardly wait to go into labor so I could rest,'' she
said in an interview in the September issue of Good Housekeeping
magazine. ``A month after the baby arrived, I went back to work and
discovered I was simply burnt out.''
   One of her three shows, ``Incredible Sunday,'' was canceled and
she decided to leave the other two, ``A.M. Los Angeles'' and the

   Metropolitan Opera star Jessye Norman and
violinist Isaac Stern will pay homage this weekend to Marian
Anderson, the black contralto who once was banned from performing
in Washington.
   Fifty years ago, the Daughters of the American Revolution
refused to let Anderson sing at Washington's Constitution Hall and
first lady Eleanor Roosevelt resigned from the organization in
protest.
   Within days, Anderson was invited to sing on the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial and her concert attracted a racially mixed
audience of 75,000.
   Anderson went on to become the first black singer to perform in
a leading role at the Metropolitan Opera. She sang at the
inaugurations of Presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy and before kings
and queens.
   On Saturday, Anderson, 87, will be in the audience as Norman,
Stern, conductor Julius Rudel and the Ives Symphony Orchestra
perform for her.
   Besides being a musical tribute, the evening will benefit the
Marian Anderson Award, established to promote the careers of
promising young singers.
   Anderson lives in Danbury on a 100-acre farm that she and her
late husband, architect Orpheus H. Fisher, bought more than 45
years ago.

   Soul singer Aretha Franklin is offering to sing
in a benefit in a last-ditch effort to restore music programs in
Motown's public schools.
   ``They are already working on it,'' said Franklin's publicist
Tuesday.
   Superintendent John Porter said Franklin offered to do a benefit
to help raise $1.25 million for Detroit's middle and elementary
schools' instrumental music programs.
   The classes were eliminated in June when the deficit-riddled
school board approved $50 million in cuts to balance its budget.
School officials earlier set a Monday deadline to raise the money
but extended the date until Aug. 21.
   A tax increase goes before voters Sept. 12. It would restore
music to the schools, Porter said. If approved, any additional
money raised would be added to the music curriculum.
   Businessman and former Detroit Piston Dave Bing also is leading
an effort to raise funds to restore sports programs, which were
eliminated in the budget cuts. He already has committed $600,000.

   Chuck D., the leader of the rap group Public
Enemy, says the band has reunited after firing one member for his
anti-Semitic remarks and is ready to fight the power in an upcoming
album.
   ``After having taken time out for reorganization, Public Enemy
is back in action,'' Chuck D. said in a statement Wednesday. ``The

Griff, for anti-Semitic remarks made in a newspaper interview.
   Public Enemy's follow-up to their smash album ``It Takes a
Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back'' will be titled ``Fear of a
Black Planet.'' Their current single, ``Fight the Power,'' is on
the soundtrack of the Spike Lee film ``Do The Right Thing.''
   ``We're still pro-black, pro-black culture and pro-human race.

   Mark Weinberg, however, declined to specify when Reagan, 78, and
his 68-year-old wife would arrive at the famed hospital.
   The Reagans, who live in Bel-Air, Calif., have a long

<HEAD>Test-Tube Babies Found to Develop Normally, Study Finds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Babies conceived in laboratories with the
high-tech help of fertility experts are just as likely to be normal
as babies made by amateurs in the traditional way, researchers say.
   The study was conducted to determine if infants conceived by in
vitro fertilization _ the so-called test-tube babies _ are more apt
to develop physical or mental abnormalities than other children,
said Dr. James L. Mills, a National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development researcher.
   ``The original question was, `are these children going to be
developmentally delayed?' The answer to that is very clearly not,''
Mills said Wednesday in a telephone interview. ``They did extremely
well.''
   In a study published this month in the Journal of Pediatrics,
Mills and a team of scientists from Eastern Virginia Medical School
compared the development of 83 children born as a result of in
vitro fertilization, or IVF, with 93 children born from normal
conception. The children were matched by age, sex, race, age of the
mother and other factors. They were all between 12 months and 30
months old.
   All of the IVF children were conceived at the Eastern Virginia
Medical School in Norfolk, Va., and the infants in the other group
were randomly selected from among children born within 100 miles of
Norfolk.
   Mills said the children in both groups were subjected to ``an
extremely complete job of looking for malformations,'' or birth
defects. The tests included a variety of imaging techniques, such
as ultrasound, that could detect physical abnormalities of internal
organs.
   The children also were assessed individually using tests that
measure mental development of the very young.
   No statistically important difference was found between the
groups.
   Two of the IVF children had major malformations, compared to one
such case among the non-IVF infants, Mills said, but the difference
is not considered significant.
   He said that since the number of children examined for the study
was small, there remains some statistical question about the minor
differences in the frequency of malformations. But Mills added that
``when you take our paper, along with other data, such as (IVF)
records from Australia, it's very reassuring.''
   In tests of mental development, the IVF children did slightly
better than the other group.
   ``We feel very comfortable about the intellectual development
... because they did very, very well,'' said Mills. He said that
even though there was a careful effort to match the two groups of
children on a basis of parental income and educational level, ``the
IVF children still did better.''
   This finding may reflect the fact that the parents of the IVF
children ``went to a tremendous amount of trouble to have these
children and they were going to make sure that these children got
the best in terms of stimulation and care.''
   Though children conceived by the IVF procedure popularly are
called ``test tube babies,'' conception actually takes place in a
laboratory petri dish, not a test tube.
   The dish is filled with chemicals designed to mimic the
environment of the maternal reproductive system. Sperm from the
father and eggs recovered surgically from the mother are united in
the dish and allowed to form embryos. Selected embryos then are
implanted into the mother's uterus and development can then proceed
to a normal birth.
   ``No one knows exactly what the effect (might be) of starting
the embryonic period in media (chemicals) instead of in the uterus.
There's no way they can make that exactly like the normal
situation,'' said Mills. ``There was that basis for wondering if
these kids would turn out all right.''
   IVF techniques were first successful in England, but the
procedure is now common in the United States, Australia and other
countries. Mills said thousands of children worldwide have been
born through the IVF procedure.
   The Eastern Virginia Medical School team that conducted the
study with Mills was led by Dr. Norma C. Morin.

   People in Felix Bloch's position often put a
coat over their heads or run the other way whenever a news camera
is pointed at them. But Bloch, the most visible spy suspect ever,
uses a different approach.
   He makes himself available to every lens and microphone.
   ``I've developed a real symbiotic relationship with the media,''
said Bloch, who has _ not by choice _ been leading a caravan of FBI
and news people since it was revealed he is suspected of spying for
the Soviet Union.
   Bloch's walks around Washington are attracting attention the way
Harry Truman's used to. Bloch made a trip to the cleaners Wednesday
and it was recorded by cameras. He went for a 22-mile hike Tuesday
and caused a coterie of Bloch watchers to go huffing and puffing
along.
   Wednesday was an easier day. Bloch sat on a park bench for two
hours enjoying the cool, bright day as much as anyone can with
microphones brushing his lips.
   He reached down to pet his poodle, Mephisto, and a dozen cameras
whirred. He stretched back, hands behind his head, and microphones
stretched out, too. People stared, but Bloch paid them no mind.
   ``It's lovely,'' Bloch said. ``I assure you that were it 95
degrees and 70 percent relative humidity, I would not be out here.''
   But: ``I won't say anything about the allegations.''
   Will there come a time when he will?
   ``Possibly.''
   It's that possibility and the summer doldrums that causes TV
networks and other news organization to continue the expensive
stakeouts.
   The circus atmosphere around Bloch attracted a persistent
heckler and he finally said, ``I'm not saying another word as long
as you are here.'' The FBI agents who were keeping an eye on this
year's best-known spy suspect finally felt compelled to tell the
man to back off.
   The government has brought no charges, and Bloch is free to do
what and when he pleases.
   ``I'm amazed that people have nothing better to do,'' he said to
a reporter who was doing what his editors expected him to do.
   Bloch, a high-ranking diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna for
much of the decade, is on leave from the diplomatic service while
the government investigates his conduct.
   His new bond with news people was cemented Tuesday when he hiked
into the Maryland countryside, trailed by his entourage.
   ``I normally don't take walks like that, but I had the time and
the weather was propitious,'' Bloch said. ``I had the inclination.
It was time to prove to myself perhaps that I could outlast the
media and the FBI.
   ``But they cheated. They rode part of the way. They rented
bikes, they brung in other teams. They may even have been in a
helicopter overhead.''
   Ultimately, he said: ``I was disappointed because I had to break
down and accept a ride from CBS News. I had a funny question on the
way home. They were in communication with their offices by radio
and said, `Can we take you in to the bureau.' I said, `What, the
FBI?'''
   He didn't go to CBS. The news crew, he said, ``were men and
women of their word. They dropped me off at my home.''
   What did his walk accomplish?
   ``I never asked myself that question, whether it accomplishes
anything or not,'' said Bloch. ``If I have time on my hands, I like
to mix it up. I read, I cook, I clean the house, I write, I work on
this or that and I want to get my fresh air.''
   Does he have any idea when there will be any kind of resolution
of his case.
   ``You are going to have to speak with people other than myself.''
   Was he being kept twisting in the wind, to use John Ehrlichman's
famous phrase?
   ``Well, I think I'm sitting pretty firmly on the bench,'' he
said. ``Now, unless the Fourth Estate will buy me lunch, I'm going
home.''
   The offer was made, but Bloch declined and took Mephisto home.

   Two dozen plants accounted for a third of all
the highly hazardous industrial chemical releases reported in the
United States in 1987, a national conservation group says in an
analysis of government figures.
   The National Wildlife Federation analysis released today showed
that 500 plants in 44 states disposed about 7.5 billion pounds of
toxic waste through burial or release into the air, water or public
sewage system.
   The two dozen plants in 13 states released 3.5 billion pounds of
toxic waste in 1987, the report said. The material included
chemicals and metals, some 39 of which are considered carcinogenic.
   The emissions are legal, but legislation pending before Congress
would curb many of the releases by setting tighter standards for
toxic industrial waste.
   Seven of the 12 biggest producers of toxic wastes use burial for
disposal, while five inject wastes deep into the ground. Industry
defends that method of disposal, but environmentalists disagree.
   Increasingly, such disposal methods ``threaten the nation's
ground water which supplies drinking water for almost 50 percent of
Americans,'' the federation said.
   ``Which community will see disease outbreaks from polluted
surface and ground water? What species of fish or wildlife will be
threatened by acute or chronic toxicity? No one knows,'' said
federation president Jay Hair.
   In a preface to the report, Hair said its purpose was ``to
emphasize the scope of toxic (release) problems.''
   He cautioned that the figures themselves provide no accurate way
to predict health or environmental effects, but he said they make
clear ``we are dumping too many chemicals into our environment at
too high a level.''
   No. 1 on the top 500 list was the ALCOA plant in Point Comfort,
Texas, which reported 465 million pounds of toxic wastes in 1987,
almost all of it buried at the facility.
   A dozen facilities each reported more than 100 million pounds of
wastes were released, while 118 plants reported disposing at least
10 million pounds, the study said. Each facility reported at least
2.6 million pounds of toxic releases.
   The Environmental Protection Agency made the raw data available
last month after receiving reports from more than 18,000 facilities.
   The 480-page federation analysis said the 7.5 billion pounds of
toxic material released by the 500 facilities was about 70 percent
of the total 10.3 billion pounds reported in 1987, the latest year
for which figures were available.
   ALCOA had three other plants among the top 15 on the list of
those releasing the largest amounts of toxic material, including
its Rockdale, Texas, plant, which was No. 3 with 329 million pounds
of wastes, most buried on plant grounds.
   The National Steel Corp. Great Lakes Division plant at Ecorse,
Mich., was the second biggest disposer of toxic wastes at 423
million pounds, almost all buried a few miles away.
   The buried wastes at the two Texas ALCOA plants, as well as the
National Steel Corp. plant in Michigan, consisted largely of
aluminum oxide, a chemical that can damage the respiratory system
and may contribute to brain damage.
   According to the study, five companies each reported more than
30 million pounds of toxic emissions released into the air in 1987,
part of the roughly 2.6 billion pounds of such wastes sent airborne
by all companies reporting to the EPA.
   Amax Magnesium, owned by Amax Inc. in Rowley, Utah, released the
most material into the air _ 68 million pounds of toxics, mostly
chlorine.
   Kennecott Utah Copper, the mining company owned by British
Petroleum, accounts for the largest amount of toxic metal waste,
most of it copper but also arsenic, chrome, barium and zinc
compounds. Most of the 158 million pounds of wastes are buried on
Kennecott property.
   The three companies that released the largest amount of toxic
chemicals into water are in Louisiana.
   Two Agrico Chemical Co. plants _ in Uncle Sam and
Donaldsonville, La. _ were ranked No. 1 and No. 3, disposing 59
million pounds and 44 million pounds of chemicals respectively,
mostly phosphoric acid.
   The Arcadian Corp. of Geismar, La., ranked second with 54
million pounds of mostly phosphoric and sulfuric acid.

<HEAD>Foreigners Still Only a Small Factor in Farm Ownership Picture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ownership of American farmland is
remaining steady, with overseas investors accounting for about 1
percent of agricultural acreage in the United States last year, the
General Accounting Office says.
   A total of 13,215 parcels comprising almost 12.5 million acres
with an overall value of $9.5 billion were held by 7,790 foreign
individuals and corporations, said the report prepared by the
congressional research arm.
   That overall picture has not changed much for a decade, although
there have been significant fluctuations in holdings by specific
countries, the GAO said in a report to Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.
   British owners had the largest share of foreign holdings last
year, with 2.78 million acres, or 22.3 percent, the report said. It
said Canadians were next with 2.5 million acres, or 20 percent.
   Then came the French with 1.14 million acres, or 9 percent, and
West Germans, with 1.13 million acres, or 9 percent.
   The report measures farmland ownership by ``foreign persons,''
which it defines as foreign individuals or corporations holding
interests of 10 percent or more. The threshold is 50 percent or
more if several foreigners own shares of less than 10 percent and
are not acting in concert.
   Britain, Canada, France and West Germany were the only countries
whose nationals held 1 million acres or more of U.S. agricultural
land and together they accounted for about 60 percent of foreign
ownership.
   The GAO did point out that one obstacle to uncovering the
ultimate beneficiaries of foreign ownership is that the Department
of Agriculture places limits on how deeply it inquires into the
maze of subsidiaries and holding companies that have an interest in
U.S. farmland.
   Thus, a holding company based in an offshore tax haven is often
able to screen from view the actual beneficiaries.
   Acreage held in the Netherlands Antilles, Switzerland, Panama
and Liechtenstein would, if combined, form the third largest share
of foreign investment in U.S. farmland, with 1.78 million acres, or
14.2 percent, it said.

   America's major farm export subsidy program
boosted U.S. wheat shipments overseas 10 percent to 30 percent in
1986-87 but did not perform as well the next year, according to
recent studies.
   After studying the numbers, economists conclude that the
Agriculture Department's export enhancement program is more
effective in years when world stocks are high, U.S. supplies are
large and competition is keen, according to the August issue of
USDA's Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   Tight supplies and high demand from importers diminish the
importance of the program, it said.
   Under the program, exporters are paid bonuses for selling U.S.
farm commodities overseas. The bonuses take the form of so-called
generic certificates, which can be sold for cash or redeemed for
commodities held by USDA's Commodity Credit Corp.
   The export enhancement program has increased the U.S. share of
certain North African markets. The American share of the Moroccan
wheat market shot up from 50 percent to almost 100 percent through
the end of last year.
   The U.S. share of the Algerian market rose from 25 percent in
1984-85 to more than 70 percent in 1986-87. The gains came at the
expense of the European Community, a fierce competitor whose own
subsidies were used as a rationale for starting the export
enhancement program.

   Industrial consumers of sugar and other
sweeteners are urging agricultural officials to raise the import
quota on foreign sugar, citing a 2-cent increase in domestic raw
sugar prices in recent months.
   ``Immediate relief is urgently needed to increase the supply of
imported sugar,'' said a statement from Thomas Hammer, president of
the Sweetener Users Association, representing companies that use
sweeteners in their products, such as candy and soft-drink makers.
   The government maintains tight quotas on the import of sugar as
a means of protecting U.S. sugar growers and the corn-sweetener
industry from lower-priced foreign sugar.
   Sugar growers, sensitive to complaints that they are getting a
special-interest boon at the expense of consumers, unveiled a study
on Tuesday saying that combined with the sweetener makers they
create 144,442 jobs and pump $7.4 billion a year into the nation's
economy.
   With U.S. sugar prices far above the world market level,
however, the complaints are guaranteed to keep coming as Congress
gears up to write a farm bill next year.
   ``The recent increase in raw sugar prices reflects the extremely
tight supplies of raw sugar, which are threatening normal
operations within the sugar industry,'' Hammer said.
   ``The recent volatile price situation demonstrates the absurdity
of the statements that have been made suggesting that the nation's
restrictive sugar program is a good deal for the American consumer
because it ensures stable prices.''

   Tuition inflation is easing a bit at many
colleges, especially public two-year institutions, but a year at
the costliest private colleges will top $21,000, an annual survey
shows.
   The College Board, in its annual tuition survey released
Wednesday, found average charges heading 5 to 9 percent higher come
fall.
   At two-year public colleges, the increase will average 5 percent
to $842, slightly less than the 5.9 percent annualized rise in
consumer prices during the first six months of 1989.
   Average tuition and fees at four-year public institutions will
increase 7 percent to $1,694, with an additional $3,039 in average
room and board charges.
   Some 80 percent of U.S. college students attend public
institutions. Costs at those and other institutions of higher
learning had been surging consistently faster than the overall
inflation rate throughout the 1980s.
   ``It looks like the increases are moderating somewhat,'' said
Richard Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities. ``The gap between the
increases and the Consumer Price Index is narrowing.
   ``On the other hand, we're still feeling awful pressures on
faculty salaries. They are still below 1972 levels in terms of
purchasing power.''
   Private four-year college rates, meanwhile, continue to soar.
Average tuition and fees this fall will rise by 9 percent to
$8,737. Room and board charges will add an average of $3,898.
   Among the costliest, a year at Bennington College in Vermont
will cost an estimated $21,775 including tuition, fees, room and
board, books, supplies, transportation and other expenses. Harvard
College in Boston, Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., and Sarah
Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y. are among other highly
selective schools that will top the $21,000 mark.
   ``Students may not realize that more expensive colleges usually
have more financial aid available and use more of their own funds
for aid,'' said board President Donald M. Stewart.
   He added that financial aid from public and private sources now
totals a record $26 billion.
   Nonetheless, U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos said
he was ``increasingly concerned about the growing gap between the
price of higher education and what students can afford.''
   ``Every leader in higher education must make holding costs down
a priority,'' he said.
   In addition, freshmen at some top schools face a double dose of
bad tuition news.
   Duke University, the University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins
University, Seton Hall University and George Washington University
are among a few that have recently announced two-tiered tuition
systems in which first-time students will be hit with double-digit
increases roughly twice those imposed on upperclassmen.
   The priciest four-year public colleges charge fees comparable to
private institutions, at least for out-of-state students. At the
University of Vermont, for example, non-resident undergraduates
face total estimated costs of $17,084 _ $8,000 more than Vermont
residents.
   At private two-year colleges, tuition fees will rise an average
7 percent to $4,713, while average room and board charges will add
$3,258.
   The College Board's 1989 averages were based on cost data from
1,892 of the nation's 3,200 colleges and universities.
   The College Board is a private, non-profit organization whose
members include over 2,600 colleges and other educational
institutions.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Urged to Provide 900-Number Safeguards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children are racking up huge telephone charges
without parental permission on the promise of talking to Mighty
Mouse, Woody Woodpecker and other cartoon characters, a children's
advocacy group says.
   AT&amp;T should be required to provide consumer safeguards for use
of the special-charge 900 numbers, Action for Children's Television
said Wednesday in a petition filed with the Federal Trade
Commission.
   The advocacy group contends that sponsors of the phone services
have found a way to target children 12 and under with
advertisements urging them to dial a 900 number.
   Andrea West, product marketing manager for 900 numbers at AT&amp;T,
said the company was being unfairly singled out because other
companies also offer the service, usually after AT&amp;T has rejected
them because of its guidelines.
   ``We are the only ones that have a standard,'' she said.
   At a cost of $2 for the first minute and 45 cents for each
additional minute, children are told they can ``speak to'' the
character. The petition said the children listen to a recorded
message that often asks the caller to call again for a new story or
a continuation of the present one.
   Robert H. Lorsch, whose Beverly Hills-based Teleline Inc. is a
major producer of the programs, says his company has cooperated in
all efforts to set standards for the industry.
   He said his research has shown that most children get their
parents' permission to make the calls.
   The ACT petition asked that AT&amp;T be forced to give refunds to
parents who are caught by surprise with such bills _ at least for
the first such bill; that blocking devices be made available to
screen out 900 numbers; and that bills be clearly itemized to
denote ``those services which are directed to children under 12
years of age.''
   The 900 numbers invite children to talk to popular personalities
and cartoon characters, such as the Tooth Fairy, Mighty Mouse or
Woody Woodpecker and often offer products such as posters, signs or
shirts as enticements to call, according to the ACT petition.
   ``While AT&amp;T relies on the fact that the price of such calls is
displayed in the advertisement and that there are clear admonitions
not to call without parents' permission, these advertisements are
no less deceptive and unfair,'' the petition said.
   ``The 10-year-old child does not really take in the information
about the charge,'' the petition said. ``Even if the child does
understand that a charge will be made, he or she cannot make a
reasonable decision about the appropriate size of the monthly bill
as against family income or other claims upon it.''
   The ads run mostly on independent stations between 2 and 5 p.m.,
with most of the viewers being ``latchkey'' children whose parents
are away, ACT said.
   AT&amp;T's West said she agrees in principle with itemizing the
bills, but that is up to local companies. Some local companies
already block 900 services automatically, she said.
   As for refunds, the company allows customers to appeal and each
case is judged separately. Critics, however, say most consumers
lack the savvy to appeal.

   The government is giving 389 groups, including
a homosexual rights organization, the chance to benefit from
federal payroll deductions that raise about $160 million a year for
charity.
   ``Frankly, it is a thrilling prospect for us,'' Thomas Stoddard,
executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund,
said Wednesday. ``Being listed helps fulfill our mission.''
   The fund, established in 1972 to defend homosexuals and
homosexual rights in court, was one of 19 groups that received
last-minute approval for inclusion. It is the first overtly
homosexual organization to be included in the government list.
   ``I assume, frankly, that there was simply a desire to keep
Lambda out of the circle by virtue of its mission,'' Stoddard said
about the earlier rejection.
   The drive, the Combined Federal Campaign, is the nation's
largest single fundraising campaign.
   Getting listed can bring large amounts to an organization at
virtually no cost. But it also can bring nothing if federal
employees don't specifically designate the charity.
   Workers are allowed to choose up to five charities from a list
that, including local charities, may number more than 1,000.
   Other participants in this year's drive are anti-abortion and
pro-abortion rights groups; Ralph Nader's Center for Auto Safety;
Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum Educational &amp; Legal Defense Fund;
the liberal People for the American Way and the American Civil
Liberties Union Foundation.
   Among those rejected were the Red River Valley Fighter Pilots
Association, Trout Unlimited and Cultural Survival Inc.
   Former President Reagan issued a 1983 executive order
restricting the federal drive to traditional health and welfare
charities. After protests and lawsuits by advocacy groups, Congress
enacted legislation in 1986 broadening the grounds for admission
but left discretion in the hands of the director of the Office of
Personnel Management.
   OPM Director Constance Newman reviewed rejected applications and
reversed the decision on Lambda and 18 others, OPM said Wednesday
in announcing the list.
   She gave qualified approval to eight more, left six pending and
denied approval to 55 _ of which 33 had not complied with requests
for additional information.
   Approval went to a range of causes, some potentially
controversial.
   Among them were the Firearms Civil Rights Legal Defense Fund,
the United Palestinian Appeal, Human Life International, the
National Association of Black Law Enforcement Executives, United
States Military Sports Association, the Living Bank and Operation
California.
   The National Right to Life Educational Trust Fund, the Religious
Coalition for Abortion Rights Education Fund and Planned
Parenthood-World Population already were listed. So was the
National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation Inc., a
conservative group.
   The fund drive raises about $160 million annually from 4 million
federal employees, including military people and postal workers,
with the average giving $60.68.
   It is the largest employee solicitation in the country, OPM
said, although it collects just a fraction of what Americans
individually give to church or charity _ $87 billion in 1988,
according to the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel.
   About 80 percent of the gifts are designated. Of the rest, 82
percent goes to local United Way campaigns, 7 percent to a group of
33 international service agencies, 7 percent to national health
agencies and 4 percent to local groups, according to OPM.

   Citicorp has agreed on a preliminary basis to
buy and lease about 20 floors of a new office tower in Hong Kong in
a move described by a bank official as a vote of confidence in the
territory's future.
   New York-based Citicorp also will arrange $667 million in loans
to help finance construction of the twin-tower complex, project
leader Great Eagle Co. announced Wednesday.
   The British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The
military suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in
early June and the subsequent crackdown on dissent in China has
damaged confidence in the territory's future.
   Securities analysts praised the news, saying that providing
space to Citicorp would help set a base for rents in the downtown
building and lock in a well-known anchor tenant to help fill the
complex.
   Citicorp also would benefit by acquiring a significantly higher
profile in Hong Kong. Its local headquarters now is far from
downtown.
   Preliminary work on the construction site has begun and the
complex is expected to be completed in less than four years.
   Steven Baker, Citicorp's division executive for East Asia, said
the bank had been looking for a downtown location for three years.
The bank plans to take about 400,000 square feet, or one-quarter,
of the new complex.
   ``Our commitment to finance this enormous office complex and our
serious negotiations to both anchor the space and invest as an
equity participant reflect our confidence in Hong Kong and our
determination to play an increasingly important role in the
community,'' he said.

   For years, many elite colleges and universities
have cooperated to figure out amounts of financial aid they should
give to students, but now federal antitrust investigators are
investigating the practice.
   Justice Department officials Wednesday acknowledged an
investigation was under way, but refused to disclose details.
   ``Antitrust division investigations are not a matter of public
record,'' agency spokesman David Runkel said.
   Financial aid for college students totaled some $26 billion last
year, said Kathleen Brouder, head of College Scholarship Service
information services in New York.
   She noted that colleges began working together in the 1950s,
when the Soviet-U.S. space race set off a flurry of scholarship,
loan and grant-giving by governments and institutions seeking to
beef up American education.
   The schools' objective has been to avoid bidding wars for
students, Ms. Brouder said.
   ``There was intense bidding, and people were concerned about the
fact that aid might be going in amounts that didn't need to go to
people, and they were very concerned about scarce institutional
resources,'' Ms. Brouder said.
   The Justice Department would not comment on what prompted the
investigation.
   On May 2, The Wall Street Journal reported the practice by 23
elite schools of meeting formally once a year to decide how much
each applicant for aid could afford.
   This is how it hypothetically works: Yale decides the Smiths can
pay $3,000 toward daughter Joan's education. But Dartmouth's aid
formula reckons the Smiths can only afford $2,000. The two schools
then work out the difference until they agree on a figure, say
$2,900. When Joan Smith receives acceptance letters from Yale and
Dartmouth, they both say she can receive financial aid, short of
$2,900.
   This year more than 10,000 high school seniors and their
families were subject to this arrangement, the Journal said.
   Schools named in this practice: Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, the
University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Yale, Amherst, Barnard,
Bowdoin, Bryn Mawr, Colby, Mount Holyoke, Middlebury, Smith,
Trinity, Tufts, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan and Williams.
   Many schools on that list said Wednesday they were not the
subject of an investigation. Others, including Harvard, the
University of Chicago and Tufts University, declined to comment on
how they figure financial aid.
   But William Cotter, president of Colby College in Waterville,
Maine, said the probe appears to revolve around the possible fixing
of salaries, fees, tuition and financial-aid requirements.
   He denied Colby was fixing costs with other schools. ``There is
absolutely no agreement on salary and tuition,'' Cotter said. ``We
compete vigorously with one another for students. We compete
vigorously for faculty.''
   Like other officials at schools contacted, Amherst College
spokeswoman Terry Allen said: ``We believe we are in compliance
with the law. But if it is determined that we are not, we will do
everything to comply.''

<HEAD>Congress Told Other Countries' Help Would Cut Little from US Trade
Deficit</HEAD>

   Congress is being advised that cooperation by
other countries could bring the United States only $10 billion
closer to balancing its worldwide accounts by 1994, and that the
cooperation would be hard if not impossible to get.
   The Congressional Budget Office is estimating that, under
present laws, the United States will spend $75 billion more in
other countries than it takes in from them in 1994. For this year,
the figure is $129 billion.
   These are estimates of the current account deficit, the widest
measure of income and outgo. It includes not only trade in goods,
but money spent for services such as banking and airline fares and
money paid out as interest on debt.
   The total is what the United States has to borrow from other
countries.
   ``Policies for Reducing the Current-Account Deficit,'' the
report made public Wednesday, suggests that the deficit could be
brought down most by cutting government spending and increasing the
money supply.
   Its calculation is based on a spending cut that amounts to 1
percent of the total that the United States produces _ that is,
more than $40 billion. It suggests a 4 percent increase in the
supply of money.
   Those changes would reduce the $75 billion deficit by $29.9
billion in 1994, it figures.
   On top of that, it looks at what would happen if other countries
also increase their money supply by 4 percent, and increase their
government spending by 1 percent instead of cutting it.
   Such increases would provide the additional $10 billion cut in
the U.S. international balance, bringing it down to $45.1 billion
in 1994.
   But Stephan Thurman, an analyst in the office, called the
suggestions for other countries' action unrealistic.
   ``Many foreign industrial countries are facing inflationary
pressures that could well be exacerbated by fiscal and monetary
stimulation designed to reduce current account imbalances in the
United States,'' the report said.
   ``Other countries _ for example Japan and West Germany _ are
also striving to reduce budget deficits as a means of increasing
national saving as they prepare for ... changes that will
significantly increase the number of retired people in coming
decades.''
   The report said cooperation of the kind suggested is more likely
if newly industrializing countries such as Brazil, Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and
Taiwan are excluded
   It pointed out that these governments have their own policy
objectives. For example, while the price of the dollar has been
going down in the currencies in other industrial countries, this
has been allowed to occur only recently by some Third World
countries in terms of their own money.
   If these eight are left out of the calculations, the additional
reduction in the U.S. deficit would amount to only $2.9 billion in
1994, the report calculated.

<HEAD>Gen. Colin L. Powell `Never Gets Rattled,' Associates Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, in line to become the
first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is a man of
exceptional judgment who ``never gets rattled,'' associates say.
   Bush administration sources said the president was expected to
nominate Powell today to become the nation's top military officer.
The position would require Senate confirmation.
   Powell, 52, the former White House national security adviser, is
credited with helping restructure the National Security Council
following the Iran-Contra scandal. He now heads the U.S. Army
Forces Command at Fort MacPherson Ga., which is charged with
keeping U.S. troops ready for combat.
   The son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell is the fourth black to
achieve the rank of four-star general.
   ``He is a person of exceptional judgment and intellect,'' said
Charles Duncan, deputy defense secretary under President Carter,
said in November 1987 when Powell was named to succeed Frank
Carlucci as national security adviser.
   Gen. P.X. Kelley, who worked with Powell in the Pentagon before
retiring as Commandant of the Marine Corps, once described him as
``a very extraordinary guy.''
   ``He can handle stress extremely well. He never gets rattled. He
was always a cool head,'' Kelley said.
   And Carlucci has said, ``I think he should go to the very top of
the military establishment _ up to and including chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.''
   A tall, husky man, Powell collects and repairs old Volvos in his
spare time. He also visits groups of young blacks to tell them of
their duty to help others and to protect the gains of the civil
rights movement.
   ``Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved
the way for you,'' he told Clark Atlanta University graduates this
spring. ``The greatest danger ... is complacency.''
   He speaks without bitterness of the occasional racial harassment
he suffered during the mid-1960s as a young officer at Fort
Benning, Ga., friends say. He distinguished himself as the best
infantry instructor at Benning, and in Vietnam won a Bronze Star
and a Purple Heart. He also has received the Distinguished Service
Medal and the Legion of Merit.
   The watershed in his career may have been a White House
fellowship he won in 1972. He was assigned to the Office of
Management and Budget where he worked for Caspar Weinberger and
Carlucci.
   Later, as military assistant to Defense Secretary Weinberger,
Powell was intimately involved in the 1983 Grenada invasion and the
Libyan bombing of 1986.
   Powell then commanded a corps in Germany and refused several
requests to become Carlucci's deputy national security adviser. He
finally gave in to a personal appeal by President Reagan and
explained in January 1987, ``I'm a serviceman, a soldier, and it
looked like my service might be of greater use here.''
   Powell came under scrutiny in the Iran-Contra affair because he
was one of the few people who knew about the secret sale of arms to
Iran. However, it did not hurt his reputation and he was never
accused of wrongdoing.
   A congressional source, who spoke in 1987 on condition of
anonymity, said Powell opposed the arms sales, ``but when the
decision was made by the president (Reagan), he executed it.''
   In a speech last November, Powell was cautious about prospects
for change in the Soviet Union, arguing against a ``help
Gorbachev'' policy at a conference organized by the American Stock
Exchange.
   ``Will perestroika ... lead to a kinder, gentler Soviet Union?''
he said. ``...We cannot forget that our overall relationship
continues to be both competitive and adversarial. This is unlikely
to change within our lifetimes.''
   Powell met his wife, Alma, on a blind date in 1962, and they
have two daughters and a son.

<TEXT>
   Peter Watson resisted war when it was
neither chic nor acceptable. He thought World War II was a terrible
mistake and became a conscientious objector.
   Now, he's attacking war by financing peace.
   The 64-year-old real estate investor has pledged $1 million to
the University of Rochester in New York to establish a center to
study peace.
   ``We have three good academies teaching people how to wage
war,'' Watson said, referring to West Point, Annapolis and the Air
Force Academy. ``We need to have institutions of higher learning
teaching people how to wage peace.''
   America was already at war when Watson entered Harvard
University as a freshman. He saw many of his classmates and his two
brothers go off to fight, but he simply believed war was
meaningless and wrong.
   So, after being drafted in 1942, he opted for alternative
service. He eventually volunteered for the ``guinea pig unit,'' a
group of conscientious objectors who were used to test the body's
tolerance to high altitude, extreme temperature and different
proteins.
   One of his duties was to test the limits of his body under
desertlike conditions. He rode a stationary bicycle in a room
heated to a sweltering 120 to 130 degrees for eight hours without
water. The salt water solution he was given at the end of the day
was ``delicious.''
   Watson said his guinea pig years were fulfilling, so he thinks
it only fitting to give the money to the Rochester, N.Y.,
university _ the site of the experiments.
   Dr. Carl Honig, a researcher at the University of Rochester,
said the work in respiratory study saved the lives of soldiers
stationed in the Aleutian Islands and North Africa, and thousands
of others since then.
   ``Those studies have prolonged the life and added to comfort of
patients with any type of respiratory disease, whether it's
emphysema, or asthma or lung cancer,'' Honig said.
   No one died during any of the Rochester experiments, but at
least two men perished during ``guinea pig'' exercises elsewhere,
Watson said.
   ``It's important for every generation to have some (people),
however visionary and impractical at the time, stand for something,
stand for the abolition of war,'' Honig said. ``Those people did it
at great risk.''
   Watson got a medical discharge after developing ulcers during
nutritional experiments aimed at trying to avert starvation
following the war. He went back to Harvard's medical school for two
years before dropping out to volunteer for more research, and to
conduct research himself.
   In 1962, seeing an opportunity, he moved to Vermont and invested
in real estate when land could be had for $1 an acre.
   But after suffering a stroke in 1979, Watson found himself with
time on his hands. He sought information on the results of his
unit's wartime research and eventually talked to Honig about a
center that could unite various academic disciplines _ including
history, philosophy and political science _ in the study of peace.
   ``Peace is breaking out all over the world,'' he said. ``Let's
nudge it along a little bit.''
   Rochester officials proposed the Peter D. Watson Center for The
Study of International Peace and Cooperation and agreed to raise $5
million for it.
   Watson seems more the successful capitalist than the long-haired
peacenik. A prominent stained-glass window with an American eagle
motif hangs beside the balcony of his home overlooking Greensboro's
Caspian Lake, and he keeps rifles that have been in a family that
has gone to war since the American Revolution.
   But Watson said the window is not there to show patriotism. He
just liked the design. And the weapons, well, they seem to serve as
reminders of a history that need not be repeated.
   ``Peace has to be made reputable and war disreputable,'' Watson
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Passport Not Necessarily The Ticket Out of Soviet Union</HEAD>

   For the dozen or so people who have dual
U.S.-Soviet citizenship, their American passports have not
necessarily been a ticket out of the Soviet Union.
   Yuri Semenenko, for example, took a five-year detour through
Soviet prison camps.
   In the era of glasnost, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is besieged
by tens of thousands of Soviets who want to become Americans. In
their midst is a much smaller group _ 12 or so _ who can claim to
be dual citizens.
   Semenenko, the son of a Soviet military officer on assignment
during World War II, is an American citizen by virtue of his birth
in Wilcox Memorial Hospital in Portland, Ore., on Feb. 10, 1945.
   All he wants to do is go back to Portland with his wife Elena, a
young dancer who is to due to give birth to their first child in
mid-September.
   ``I'd like it very much if my child was born in Portland, but I
see that it won't happen,'' said the Leningrad resident, a tanned,
tennis fanatic who also was a ranking Soviet motocross racer as a
teena-ger.
   ``It's simply a fact of life that he's here,'' said an embassy
official familiar with Semenenko's case. ``You can't claim U.S.
constitutional protection when you're in a foreign country.''
   Other dual citizens also were born in the United States and
emigrated with their parents to Czechoslovakia, Poland or the
Baltic republics during the Depression, said the officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The areas they lived in were absorbed by the Soviet Union after
World War II, and during the Cold War they hid their American
birthright. A handful of dual citizens, mostly in their 60's and
70's, came forward only recently.
   Semenenko's saga was different. His father, Capt. 3rd Rank
Mikhail Semenenko, was in the United States in 1943 to inspect a
ship being sent to the Soviet Union under a lend-lease program. His
wife, Tatyana, went with him.
   Near the end of their tour, Yuri was born. Several months later,
the family got on a boat for the Soviet Far East.
   All the family brought back was perhaps 100 postcards of
Portland, New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and other cities, as
well as a few other souvenirs. Little remains.
   ``When I was a boy, I liked giving them to my friends,'
Semenenko said ruefully. ``I sold some of them, too. We were poor
when I was growing up.''
   But under U.S. law, since his parents did not have diplomatic
status in the United States, Semenenko was entitled to American
citizenship. It took until 1980, when Jewish emigration to the
United States had peaked, for him to figure that out.
   When he approached the U.S. Consulate in Leningrad, Soviet
guards arrested him at the entrance. He was convicted of bribery
and hooliganism, charges Semenenko said police concocted to punish
him for seeking his U.S. passport.
   Semenenko was sentenced to 6{ years in a prison camp above the
Arctic Circle, where he said inside temperatures rarely exceeded 50
degrees.
   Five years later, in spring 1988, Semenenko was released. In a
period of reform, he again applied for his U.S. passport and
received it last March.
   But officials told him that to leave he had to send a letter to
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet renouncing his Soviet
citizenship. He did that in April and is awaiting a reply.
   U.S. officials say they bring up cases like Semenenko's every
time they meet with representatives of the Soviet Foreign
Ministry's office of humanitarian affairs. But visa offices are
under another ministry, and it's slow going through the bureacracy.
   The Soviets have promised such cases will be resolved
immediately under new regulations that have been expected for
months but still have not been implemented.
   Meanwhile, Semenenko contemplates life in the United States.
   ``People ask me what what I'll do over there. I tell them I'll
wash dishes,'' said Semenenko, who can sprinkle his Russian
conversation with English. ``I know that if I go to America I'll
live worse than I do now. I won't have my own house, and I'll have
to work several times harder.''
   But he said he does not have confidence in the Soviet reforms
and will never feel comfortable living in the Soviet Union.

   A Tennessee woman caught speeding on
Interstate 75 got even with the Whitfield County police department.
She paid her $55 fine by mailing in 5,500 pennies.
   Jeanette Lord even enclosed a little note with her payment.
   ``Enclosed you will find $55 for my traffic citation. I had to
rob my piggy bank, but it is all there. I have learned my lesson
and will obey all traffic laws. Have a nice day,'' she wrote, along
with a drawing of a smiling face.
   Herman Hansird, Whitfield County probate judge, said he had
received payment in coins before, but this was the first time they
had been mailed.
   ``She's a very pleasant lady to talk with, but she was a little
upset about the fine,'' he said.
   Hansird said a bank will count the pennies, and if they don't
total $55 he will make up the difference. ``I'm sure not going to
call her back and tell her she shortchanged me,'' he said.

   The organizer of what is being billed
as the largest rubber duck race ever is miffed that Rhode Island
won't allow the ducks in its waters.
   Great American Duck Races predicts up to 50,000 people will turn
out to watch 70,000 rubber ducks race down a Salt River Project
Canal in Scottsdale Nov. 4.
   The Phoenix-based group has organized ``ducks for bucks'' races
in more than 40 states since May 1988, with nary a quack of
protest, says Eric Schechter, the organization's president. The
average race raises about $100,000 for charities, with companies
and individuals paying to sponsor ducks, he said. But the ducks
won't be racing down any Rhode Island rivers anytime soon.
   The state's Department of Environmental Management has banned
the races, claiming they violate the federal Clean Water Act and in
Rhode Island's Freshwater Wetlands laws.
   ``There is no way in the world you can collect all these little
pieces of plastic, no matter how well organized you are,'' said
Stephanie Powell, a department spokeswoman. Officials also say the
races attract large crowds that trample the riverbanks.
   Schechter dismisses the concerns, though. The buoyant rubber
ducks are checked for toxicity before being used in races or sold
as souvenirs, and people in kayaks scoop up all the ducks when the
contests are over, he says.
   ``We take this seriously because we are concerned about the
environment also,'' Schechter said. ``Rhode Island is the only
state we've had trouble organizing races in.''

<TEXT>
   A Social Security advisory panel has targeted
the financing of a health care system as its first mission.
   Deborah Steelman, head of the Advisory Council on Social
Security, said the current health care system ``overlaps,
duplicates, omits, confuses'' and leaves many needy people without
adequate care. She said the panel must ``develop recommendations
for a sound, sustainable health care financing system'' to face new
strains with the aging of the Baby Boom generation.
   Ms. Steelman said the current Medicare system ``is projected to
be insolvent by early in the next century, before the Baby Boom has
even begun to enter retirement.''
   The 13-member advisory council holds its opening meeting on
Thursday and Friday. Such a panel is appointed every four years to
examine issues affecting the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid
programs.
   Ms. Steelman said the council hopes to issue a draft report on
health care financing by July 1990 and recommendations on the
financing and role of Social Security benefits by December 1990. A
final report to Congress and the Department of Health and Human
Services is due in January 1991.

   Although the State Department is recommending
that Americans defer non-essential travel to China, improved
security conditions will enable about 260 dependents of U.S.
government employees in China who were evacuated in June to return.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that although the
security situation has improved, it is still more unsettled than
before the imposition of marital law in May.
   The dependents were ordered home three days after Chinese
military forces routed demonstrators who had occupied Tienanmen
Square in Beijing for weeks.
   As part of the disturbances, Chinese troops fired their weapons
in the vicinity of a compound where diplomats and other foreign
residents live. The U.S. Embassy's chief of security said bullets
flew through a window into a room where his two children were
watching television.
   The incident prompted a strong protest by the U.S. Embassy to
Chinese authorities. Ms. Tutwiler was unable to say whether the
issue was resolved to the satisfaction of U.S. officials.

   The Commerce Department has until Friday to
answer claims by the National Wildlife Federation that the
government is not protecting endangered sea turtles from extinction.
   The federation contends that the government's own studies show
restricted shrimp-fishing tow times are ineffective.
   An order Wednesday by a U.S. District Court judge also asks
Commerce to respond to the federation's request that the agency
enforce a law that requires shrimper to equip their nets with
devices that let sea turtles escape.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, under an order by federal
Judge Thomas Hogan to protect sea turtles, this week required
shrimpers to either use the turtle excluder devices, which they
loathe, or limit trawl times to 105 minutes.
   The same day those rules took effect, the wildlife federation
filed its petition with the court seeking access to government
documents that it claims indicate tow times jeopardize the
endangered sea turtle.

<HEAD>Doctors Debate Using Anencephalic Babies for Organ Transplants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors should be allowed to ignore the usual
standards of brain death in babies born without most of their
brains so their organs can be used immediately for transplants, a
report concluded today.
   These infants, known as anencephalic babies, cannot survive, and
physicians would like to salvage their hearts, livers and other
organs for other sick babies. But these organs usually cannot be
used, because they are damaged by lack of oxygen before the babies
are pronounced dead.
   ``Our proposal asserts that the anencephalic infant is not
alive,'' wrote Dr. Robert D. Truog of Harvard Medical School and
bioethicist John C. Fletcher of the University of Virginia.
   Their report was one of three papers in the New England Journal
of Medicine exploring the ethical and practical issues involved in
using these baby's organs for transplants.
   In the same issue, Drs. Donald N. Medearis Jr. of Massachusetts
General Hospital and Lewis B. Holmes of Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston countered that current standards requiring
complete brain death should be retained.
   ``Anencephalic infants are alive, and the length of their lives
cannot be predicted accurately,'' they wrote.
   They cautioned that making an exception for anencephalic infants
might eventually lead to taking organs from people with other
profound medical conditions, such as other babies with severe head
malformations or adults in persistent vegetative states.
   Anencephalic babies are born with brain stems, which control
breathing and some bodily functions, but the rest of their brains
are missing. In current practice, doctors must wait until all brain
stem activity stops before declaring the babies dead.
   ``I think there is a moral obligation to reconsider the issue,''
Truog said in an interview. ``There are children who die because
these organs are not being used. We need to ask ourselves whether
on balance we are not doing a greater harm by not using these
organs.''
   But Medearis and Holmes said that these babies would never be a
major source of organs. They estimated that fewer than 200
anencephalic babies are born alive in the United States annually,
and organs from some cannot be used because of other birth defects
or difficulties matching organs with potential recipients.
   In one approach to the situation, doctors at Loma Linda
University Medical Center in California experimented with putting
anencephalic babies in intensive care to try to keep their organs
healthy until they died.
   In a separate report in the journal, they said that six infants
were put on respirators immediately after birth, while six others
were put on respirators only after death appeared imminent.
   But Dr. Joyce L. Peabody and colleagues said their program was
impractical, because intensive care slowed the dying process, and
the babies lingered for periods up to two months.
   Although brain death was confirmed within three days of birth in
two of the Loma Linda babies, their organs were not used for
transplants.
   Reasons included the limited number of babies waiting with the
same blood type, the size of the available organs, the health of
the recipient infants and the fear of transplant centers of
becoming involved in the controversy over using organs from
anencephalic babies.

<HEAD>Labor Department Says Any Gifts For IRAs Subject To Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department has decided that
individual retirement accounts lose their tax-deferred status if
banks offer free services in exchange for opening such accounts.
   The ruling was made last month after an attorney sought from the
department an interpretation of the federal pension laws, said a
Labor Department official who spoke Wednesday on the condition he
not be identified.
   The attorney, the official said, asked the department whether
federal pension law prohibited a bank from offering free checking
to an individual who opened an IRA and then invested $2,000 of the
account's assets in bank financial products such as certificates of
deposit.
   The department, in an interpretation issued July 14, informed
the attorney that such an arrangement violated provisions of
federal pension law that prohibit fiduciaries of retirement funds
from making decisions that result in their direct financial gain.
   In other words, the official said, the person opening an IRA is
legally considered the fiduciary, or trustee, of his or her own IRA
and is not allowed to make a decision that would benefit himself or
herself. In this case, the free checking would be the benefit, the
official said.
   The provision is more commonly applied to large pension plans
and is designed to prevent abuses of those funds by pension plan
managers. But the Labor Department official said there is no
distinction in the law between the large plans and individual
accounts such as IRAs.
   The official downplayed the significance of the interpretation,
saying it was in line with previous decisions. For example, he said
the department in the early 1980s made it clear that banks could
not offer gifts such as toasters or radios in exchange for opening
IRAs and other retirement accounts.
   ``Whether it's a toaster or free checking, I can't see any
distinction between the two,'' said the official. ``They're both
gifts that benefit an individual for whose benefit a retirement
plan is established.''
   By accepting such a gift, the ``account would in effect cease to
be an IRA'' and become taxable, the official said.
   He said he could not identify the attorney who asked for the
interpretation.
   The department several years ago formed a committee to study
whether small gifts such as toasters or free services should be
granted an exemption from the pension laws. But the committee has
not yet concluded its study, the official said.

   Dawn was breaking in Ethiopia as dozens of
people gathered on the steps of the Capitol early today for a
midnight vigil to pray that Rep. Mickey Leland is found alive.
   ``Tonight we speak with a sense of hope, for it is midnight
here,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson. ``Beyond midnight there is
daylight. And we've been taught that weeping may endure for a
night, but hold on and hold out. Joy cometh in the morning.''
   The search for the chairman of the House Select Committee on
Hunger entered its third day. The plane carrying the Texas Democrat
and 13 others from Addis Ababa to a refugee camp near the Sudanese
border 480 miles away disappeared Monday.
   ``We have not had any sign of the plane,'' Jackson said. ``There
is not the bad news of the crash, thus there is a margin of hope.
   ``All we do now is hope against hope,'' Jackson said in a quiet
voice, the dome of Capitol behind him ivory against the cool night
sky.
   ``Tonight we cannot hear his voice and yet we can. Tonight we
cannot see his face and yet we can,'' Rep. Floyd Flake, D-N.Y.,
told the crowd, which held green florescent ``Lightsticks.''
   ``We pray thee thou would not let his voice go unheard nor let
his pleas go unheeded. Truly our hearts are heavy for this brother
of ours and they who have gone with him.''
   Among the 13 others aboard the turboprop Twin Otter aircraft
were three congressional staff members.
   President Bush said Wednesday that Ethiopia is ```going to get
all the cooperation we can give them'' in the search.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Marxist
Ethiopia agreed to an overflight of the area by a U-2
photo-reconnaissance plane.
   An Air Force C-141 Starlifter medical evacuation plane was sent
from West Germany on Bush's authority carrying a 20-member medical
team and search and rescue, weather and communications personnel,
she said. The Defense Department also is dispatching several
aircraft.
   Wednesday night, Democratic Reps. Gary Ackerman of New York and
Al Wheat of Missouri left Washington for Ethiopia. House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley asked them to represent the House in the search for
Leland, said Howard Doyle, a spokesman for Ackerman.
   ``I believe at this moment to a moral certainty that everything
that can be done is being done,'' said Rep. Ronald V. Dellums,
D-Calif., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, which
sponsored the vigil.
   Dellums and other members of the caucus said they were
optimistic they would again see Leland, a member and former
chairman of the group.
   ``Mickey's a fighter, he's a survivor,'' said Rep. John Lewis,
D-Ga.
   Flake said he was not prepared to give up.
   ``I don't think anybody's giving up hope,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scholars Mark 100th Anniversary of Twain's `Connecticut Yankee'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One hundred years after Mark Twain published
``A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,'' the author's voice
sounds as fresh as when Twain wrote the novel, a literary scholar
says.
   ``He anticipated so much how we talk now that we're right at
home,'' said Victor Fischer, associate editor of the Mark Twain
Project at the University of California at Berkeley's Bancroft
Library. ``When you find the familiar things from his sayings and
his expressions that have entered into the language, you realize
how much he's pervaded the way we talk.''
   About 150 scholars and Twain experts from around the world meet
today through Saturday at Elmira College to mark the centennial of
the publication of ``A Connecticut Yankee'' and to celebrate one of
America's most enduring writers.
   Twain wrote some of ``A Connecticut Yankee'' in Elmira and is
buried a little more than a mile away from the Elmira College
campus.
   ``Mark Twain is our most definitively American writer,'' said
Darryl Baskin, director of the Elmira College Center for Mark Twain
Studies. ``He wrote the way Americans spoke ... and he was very
much alive to the emergence of popular culture. He connected this
with literature.''
   Marianne Curling, curator of the Mark Twain Memorial in
Hartford, Conn., said that while ``A Connecticut Yankee'' is not
Twain's most popular or successful work, it remains relevant today.
   ``It talks about the impact of technology in society,'' she
said. ``There were a lot of new and different things going on then,
the scariest of which was electricity. People either thought
electricity would cure the ills of society or destroy it. It's very
much like people regard nuclear power today.''
   The book tells about a journey back in time of Hank Morgan, a
Connecticut factory mechanic, to the 6th century England of King
Arthur.
   Twain, an avid reader of history, originally envisioned the book
as a sort of burlesque about the customs of the time, such as the
problem a knight in armor might have encountered when he had to
scratch or blow his nose.
   But as his writing progressed, it took on a much darker tone.
Twain's Yankee used his knowledge of modern technology to seize
control of the court and to begin imposing his own customs on the
land. The novel ends with an Armageddonlike battle where an army of
some 10,000 knights is slaughtered by electrocution, Gatling guns
and drowning.
   Twain himself admitted that the book ``slumped into funereal
seriousness'' in its latter stages.
   Everett Emerson, a Twain biographer, says a series of personal
setbacks, including the souring of many of the author's
investments, largely accounts for the ominous tone of the final
two-thirds of the novel.
   Fischer said the reasons for the book's change of gears remains
a source of controversy among literary critics a century later. So
too, he said, is the message that Twain aimed to convey.
   ``The dispute tends to be over whether he was extolling the 19th
century in contrast with the ignorance and cruelty of ancient times
or whether, in fact, he was saying, `A plague on both your
houses,''' Fischer said. ``There is something of both in the book.''
   Whatever the intent, the subject matter is a far cry from what
Twain had given readers previously in such books as ``Roughing
It,'' ``Innocents Abroad'' and especially ``The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer'' and ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.'' There Twain had
combined humor with an often sharp satirical eye aimed at
puncturing the pomposities and superstitions of the age.
   Twain had regarded ``A Connecticut Yankee'' as ``uncommonly
bully'' and predicted it would sell 100,000 copies in its first
year. But the book merely continued his financial headaches: it
sold 34,000 copies that first year amid mixed reviews and Twain's
own publishing company was in such bad financial condition that the
author received no money for it at all.

taking her ailing husband, Ferdinand, home to the Philippines, but
a Justice Department attorney said if she is allowed to leave,
``we'd never get her back.''
   Theodore S. Greenberg, acting chief of the department's criminal
fraud division, testified Wednesday that the Philippines does not
have an extradition treaty with the United States and that Marcos
loyalists might revolt if the former Philippine first lady went
home and was not allowed to stay.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is challenging a travel ban imposed in June by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service prohibiting her from
leaving the United States. The hearing continues today before
William Robie, the chief U.S. immigration judge.
   The Marcoses are under U.S. indictment on criminal racketeering
charges for allegedly stealing more than $100 million from the
Philippine treasury and stashing it in the United States.
   The 71-year-old former Philippine president has been separated
from the case because of respiratory, heart and kidney problems
that have kept him hospitalized for the past seven months. He
remained in critical condition Wednesday.
   Richard Hibey, attorney for the Marcoses, claims the travel ban
is unnecessary because Mrs. Marcos is prohibited from leaving the
country under terms of $5 million bail paid after her indictment in
New York last October.
   Hibey said that when Marcos dies, he would ask a New York
federal judge to allow Mrs. Marcos to accompany his body to the
Philippines for burial as long as she returns to face prosecution.
   ``Her obsession to return home is matched only by her obsession
to defend herself in New York,'' he said.
   But Greenberg said there was no guarantee she would return. The
government claims the Marcoses have billions of dollars in assets
and the loss of $5 million is not enough to prevent Mrs. Marcos
from fleeing.
   ``If she went to the Philippines, in my view, we'd never get her
back,'' Greenberg said.
   Mrs. Marcos, greeted at the courthouse by about 100 supporters
who sang her love songs and gave her flowers, testified for two
hours and broke into tears several times.
   She invoked the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination about
30 times, usually in response to questions about her family's
finances or alleged plots to return her husband to power.
   ``My obsession (is) to go home to my country,'' she said. ``I
will use all peaceful means to bring Ferdinand home.''
   However, Charles Salmon, director of the State Department's
Office of Philippine Affairs, testified that the government of
Corazon Aquino forbade Marcos' return, dead or alive, and that
commercial and private airlines had been warned of the prohibition.

   A once powerful lobbyist linked to a Washington
sex scandal was arrested for gun and drug possession after calling
police to say he'd been robbed in his hotel room by a man he met in
Times Square.
   Craig J. Spence, 48, was scheduled to appear at an Aug. 28
hearing on charges of criminal possession of a weapon and
misdemeanor possession of cocaine, said Gerald McKelvey, a
spokesman for the district attorney's office, on Wednesday.
   Spence, 48, was identified this summer by The Washington Times
as a major client of a homosexual escort service that is being
investigated by the Secret Service, District of Columbia police and
the U.S. Attorney's Office for possible credit card fraud,
authorities said.
   He has admitted using such escort services but blamed his
accountant for allowing his credit card charges to be illegally
inflated.
   Spence was arrested July 31 after calling police to the Barbizon
Hotel, McKelvey said. He spent two days in jail before pleading
innocent and being released Aug. 2.
   He told police he met Casey Regan, 22, on 42nd Street and
brought him back to his hotel room, whereupon Regan took Spence's
pistol and robbed him of $6,000 in cash and travelers checks,
McKelvey said.
   Regan told officials Spence ``had given him the money and that
he was just holding the gun to see how it felt,'' McKelvey said.
   Regan was charged with robbery, criminal possession of a weapon
and criminal possession of a controlled substance, cocaine. He was
released in his own custody.
   The Washington Times and The Washington Post characterized Regan
as a male prostitute.
   Once a Vietnam correspondent for ABC News, Spence became a
high-profile lobbyist representing Japanese clients before his
business declined in recent years.
   The Washington Times said frequent party guests at his home
included former CIA Director William Casey, conservative activist
Phyllis Schlafly and James Lilley, ambassador to China and formerly
to Korea.
   ``I had the world at my house and now they don't know who I
am,'' Spence told the newspaper Monday in an interview.
   Besides the escort service disclosures, a White House guard
allegedly accepted a Rolex watch from Spence, gave him a piece of
presidential china and allowed Spence and some friends to take
midnight tours of White House public areas last year.
   Jane Vezeris, a spokeswoman for the Secret Service, said a
subpoena has been served for Spence to testify early next week
before a grand jury in Washington.

<HEAD>Gambling Proposal Comes Up Short</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An auto dealer conceded defeat in an
attempt to put a casino gambling referendum before Ohio voters this
fall, but he promised to get the proposal on the ballot in 1990.
   Alan Spitzer, spokesman for a group of casino backers and a
potential casino owner, said the group failed to get the 306,661
signatures required by midnight Wednesday to put its initiative on
the Nov. 7 ballot. But he said he expected a new petition drive
aimed at next year's elections would succeed.
   The group began circulating petitions in June after the Ohio
Senate rejected a bill authorizing a casino in Lorain, despite
passage by the House.
   Its proposal would have permitted casinos in seven districts,
generally surrounding and including Ohio's biggest cities, subject
to approval by local voters.
   Spitzer said the plan would create jobs and boost tourism. He
has talked of building a $300 million to $400 million resort
complex and casino on an abandoned shipyard in Lorain, which he
said would breathe new life into the northern Ohio steel town.
   The LUV Ohio Committee _ LUV stands for let us vote _ fell about
40,000 signatures short of the number needed, backers said.
   Spitzer blamed a late start and a lack of people to circulate
petitions. ``Time and people _ we didn't have enough of either,''
he said.

   NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' and the box-office
smash ``Mississippi Burning'' have been given Golden Pit Awards for
negative stereotyping by a coalition of ethnic groups.
   ``We want the producers of this material to be more sensitive.
In their quest to entertain, they often contribute to negative
stereotyping,'' William Fugazy, honorary chairman of the National
Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, said Wednesday.
   ``Mississippi Burning,'' a drama about the 1964 slayings of
threorkers, was cited for ``downplaying the role of
blacks ... and portraying them as helpless during the civil rige civil

   The ``Golden Girls'' was recognized for the ``constant barrage
of negative Italian and Sicilian diatribes'' spoken by the Italian

Merry Aronson had no comment on the charge.
   Filmmaker Spike Lee's ``Do The Right Thing'' received a special

   An Iranian newspaper said today that
indirect talks between Iran and the United States on the hostage
crisis will begin within days, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted the English-language
Tehran Times as saying in an editorial the talks would be conducted
through a third country, probably Pakistan.
   ``Political observers believed that in the next few days we
should expect certain moves towards mediation, of course
unofficially,'' IRNA quoted the editorial as saying.
   It predicted the mediator would be Pakistan's foreign minister,
Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, because both Iran and the United States have
good relations with Pakistan. No other details were given.
   The newspaper, which is close to Iran's President-elect Hashemi
Rafsanjani, also quoted an aide as expressing surprise that the
United States had rejected a proposal that $2 billion in frozen
Iranian assets in U.S. banks be returned in exchange for Tehran's
help in freeing American hostages in Lebanon.
   Rafsanjani is considered a pragmatist who is anxious to rebuild
ties with the West in order to secure funds and technology to help
boost the flagging economy.
   But the leading hard-liner in the hierarchy, Interior Minister
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, has shown his opposition to any softening of
Iran's position on the hostages, urging Shiite militants to remain
poised to strike against the United States.
   The 16 Western hostages are believed held by Shiite Moslem
extremist groups under the umbrella of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God.
   The unnamed aide was quoted as saying Iran was reacting to a
report that President Bush had offered to release the Iranian
assets, frozen after militants seized the American Embassy in
Tehran in 1979, in return for the hostages' freedom.
   ``It's really strange. First the U.S. offers an
assets-for-hostages deal and then the spokesman of the White House
says that his country is not ready to pay ransom,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that the
United was not willing to link the Iranian assets to the hostages
issue.
   The Tehran Times editorial quoted Rafsanjani's aide as adding:
``What Iran meant was that the move to unfreeze the Iranian assets
would have been taken in Iran as a goodwill gesture on behalf of
the U.S.
   ``It's a clear policy of the Islamic republic not to pay or
receive ransom. ... What Iran has said more than once is that
Tehran is ready to cooperate... on humanitarian grounds.''
   Bush told reporters Wednesday he was willing ``to talk and to
exercise every diplomatic channel I can'' to free the American
captives but ruled out ``trading'' for hostages.

<HEAD>California State Bar To Move To Suspend Wallach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California State Bar said it will move
for the immediate suspension of lawyer E. Robert Wallach, who was
convicted of fraud and racketeering charges in the Wedtech case.
   ``We believe that there are elements of moral turpitude in Mr.
Wallach's conviction,'' James Bascue, chief trial counsel for the
bar's disciplinary division, said Wednesday.
   Moral turpitide covers such crimes as fraud, corruption and
perjury.
   Suspension would revoke Wallach's license pending the outcome of
his appeal. If his conviction is upheld, he could move be disbarred
permanently.
   Wallach, 55, of San Francisco, was convicted Tuesday of
illegally receiving $425,000 from Wedtech to influence his longtime
friend Edwin Meese III, then attorney general, and other government
officials in an attempt to win government contracts for the South
Bronx company.
   After a three-month trial, a federal jury in Manhattan rejected
Wallach's claim that he earned the money as legal and consulting
fees. He faces up to 45 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
   Wallach was president of the San Francisco Bar Association in
1975.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and President
Bush agreed to coordinate efforts to release foreign hostages and
Israeli prisoners held in Lebanon, a Shamir aide said today.
   The decision came in a 10-minute telephone call by Shamir to
Bush on Wednesday night. Avi Pazner, a top aide to Shamir,
described the talk as ``warm and friendly.''
   It was the first time the two leaders had talked since the
hostage crisis flared following Israel's kidnapping of Moslem
cleric Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid from southern Lebanon on July 28,
Israeli reports said.
   A spokeswoman in Pazner's office said said Bush made no mention
of Obeid's abduction, which the United States has criticized, but
that the two leaders decided it was best to join forces on the
hostage-prisoner issue.
   Shamir assured Bush that Israel would include the eight American
hostages in any deal to trade Obeid and other Shiite prisoners in
Israel's hands for three Israeli soldiers held by the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, Pazner said.
   The conversation came the same day a Shiite suicide attacker set
off a car bomb near the Israeli border in southern Lebanon,
wounding five Israeli soldiers and one Lebanese militiaman.
   Hezbollah, the shadowy pro-Iranian group, claimed responsiblity
for the assault.
   One of the wounded Israelis was in critical condition today, on
a respirator at Rambam Hospital in the northern port of Haifa. The
others were reported recovering.
   Israel's policy coordinator for southern Lebanon, Uri Lubrani,
warned Israel would retaliate for the attack.
   ``Israel will deal with the Hezbollah as it deals with all the
organizations which threaten the normal life of the security
zone,'' Lubrani said. He was referring to a strip north of Israel's
border patrolled by Israeli soldiers and its allies, the South
Lebanon Army militia.
   ``Violence has two edges and Israel will retaliate in one way or
another,'' Lubrani said. ``In due time, in a place it will choose.''
   Ron Ben-Ishai, a well-known commentator on defense issues, said
the government was caught in a dilemma over whether to stage a
reprisal at a time when there may be hope for hostage negotiations.
   ``The negotiations are at initial states and Israel will be
blamed by the United States for torpedoing them, or runs such a
risk,'' Ben-Ishai said on Israel radio.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's spokesman denied a report in
the Kuwaiti Al-Seyassah daily, which said Israel had abducted Obeid
to sabotage a PLO plan to win freedom for the American hostages
that was endorsed by the United States.
   Israel boycotts the Palestine Liberation Organization, which it
considers a terrorist group, and has repeatedly protested U.S.
contacts with the PLO.
   Rabin's spokesman, Eitan Haber, reached by telephone, said the
Kuwaiti report was ``nonsense.''

<DATELINE>FORT AMADOR, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. forces blockaded the entrance to
Fort Amador after Panamanian forces arrested two American soldiers,
and the standoff ended three hours later when both sides exchanged
arrested troops.
   U.S. military officials blamed Wednesday's confrontation, the
second in as many days, on the arrests of the American soldiers and
strongly protested the action.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces in turn condemned the blockade,
during which Panamanian troops trained anti-aircraft weapons on
U.S. helicopters circling overhead.
   The Defense Forces under strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
accused the United States of ``trying to humiliate us in our own
home'' and said Panama would not respond to provocation.
   Fort Amador is at the southern entrance to the Panama Canal and
includes barracks for Panamanian troops, the Southern Command
offices, a U.S. naval station and a golf course used by American
personnel. Noriega, commander of the Defense Forces and Panama's de
facto ruler, has offices at the fort.
   Wednesday's confrontation was the latest of several between U.S.
and Panamanian forces. American troops have held exercises that
amounted to shows of force several times during the past few
months, parking armored personnel carriers across the street from
Noriega's office.
   Sources said Noriega was not at Fort Amador on Wednesday when
the confrontation occurred.
   The incident began when a U.S. military policeman was arrested
in the Panama City neighborhood of El Chorillo, near the general
staff headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces, U.S. Army Col.
Ronald Sconyers said.
   That soldier was taken to a Panamanian installation at Fort
Amador, where another U.S. military policeman was arrested when he
tried to get his fellow soldier released.
   Panamanian military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed Sconyers' account but neither they nor Maj. Edgardo
Lopez, a spokesman for the Defense Forces, gave a reason for the
initial arrest.
   U.S. troops then arrested two Panamanian military policemen at
the gates to the fort and an Army detachment that included five
armored personnel carriers blocked the entrance. Helicopters
circled overhead, with Panamanian soldiers training anti-aircraft
guns on them.
   Civilians, including reporters, were allowed across the line
during the blockade, but not Panamanian soldiers.
   Finally, after three hours, reporters watched as U.S. and
Panamanian officers met and exchanged prisoners, after which the
U.S. troops withdrew.
   ``U.S. Southern Command officials strongly protested the actions
of members of the Panamanian Defense Forces who arbitrarily
arrested two U.S. military policemen,'' said a statement issued by
the Command.
   The arrests was seen as possible retaliation for the arrest of
29 Panamanians on Tuesday by U.S. troops. The Southern Command said
the Panamanians, who were released after 75 minutes, had entered a
military area without permission.
   The Southern Command statement said it ``reinforced'' its forces
at Fort Amador during the incident because U.S. forces are
responsible for internal security there and to protect U.S. lives
and installations in Panama.
   Lopez said the Panamanian military ``won't be trapped into
provocation'' despite the actions by the U.S. troops.
   U.S. officials have said they plan to enforce full U.S. rights
under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties and to use shows of force to
underline Noriega's inability to prevent American troops from going
where they wish.
   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since he was
indicted on drug trafficking and money laundering charges in U.S.
federal courts last year.
   Noriega has denied the charges and said they were part of a U.S.
plot to abrogate treaties that turn the canal over to Panama at the
end of 1999.
   He has fought off all U.S. efforts to force him to quit,
including economic sanctions.
   The government annulled elections last May that international
observers said were won 3-1 by the opposition.
   Government parties have been trying to arrange some
accommodation by the time acting President Manuel Solis Palma's
term ends Sept. 1, but the opposition has said Noriega must agree
to step down.
   The U.N. Security Council has scheduled debate for Friday on
Panama's complaint that the United States is trying to undermine
its government.
   Last month Brig. Gen. Henry Cisneros, commander of U.S. Army
South, told The Associated Press in an interview that he personally
thought the United States should oust Noriega by force if that was
the only way to remove him from power.

<TEXT>
   Arson is suspected in a rooming house fire in
which at least three people were killed in this Boston suburb.
   Officials combed through the rubble of the burned-out Ben Crest
Plaza Wednesday in search of the bodies of two people who are
missing and also believed victims of the fire.
   ``It is the conclusion of the investigators that this incident
should be investigated with regard to a possible arson-homicide,''
said Essex County District Attorney Howard Whitehead.
   Whitehead said a Connecticut State Police dog trained to sniff
for gasoline, kerosene and other fire accelerants had been helpful
in gathering evidence, which was being analyzed at a laboratory.
   Joe McKenney, 24, who watched the blaze from his home in an
adjacent apartment building, claimed he saw a man in one of the Ben
Crest's rooms playing with matches and what he thought was rubbing
alcohol.
   ``Right in the middle of the floor ... he was fooling around
with alcohol,'' McKenney said. ``I saw him with it, playing with
matches.''
   But Bobby Barrett, 19, who was in the room McKenney was watching
about the time the blaze erupted, said no one was playing with fire.
   Fire Marshal Joseph O'Keefe said his investigators also were
trying to determine if the building's fire alarm was operating by
tracing its circuitry and if an antiquated ``substandard''
sprinkler system was functioning.
   Tenants wearing nightclothes jumped from windows Tuesday to
escape the flames and swung down on ropes provided by management as
fire escapes. More than 19 tenants and rescuers were injured.

<HEAD>U.S. Asylum Requested by Nine Top Contra Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Contra chief of staff and eight other top
Nicaraguan rebels requested political asylum in the United States,
but said they were not running because of the Central American pact
to disband anti-Sandinista forces.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said Wednesday
that three of the requests were approved, but their names were not
released.
   Perry Rivkind, INS district director in Miami, said the claims
were given ``special action'' status and reviewed on the spot. INS
officials said the other six requests were being given top priority.
   The applications came two days after five Central American
presidents signed an accord in Tela, Honduras, calling for the
dismantling of the Contras within four months. Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega said the pact marks the death of the rebel movement.
   But the rebel officers denied their asylum requests were linked
to the accord.
   Israel Galeano, the rebel chief of staff known as Comandante
Franklin, told The Miami Herald the group sought asylum to obtain
travel documents and weren't planning to move to the United States.
   ``Some of us have the need right now to mobilize in the
international field,'' said Galeano. ``There is a need to get
documents to travel.''
   He promised to continue the fight with ``limitless human
resources'' and said he would return to Nicaragua if the Contras
are kicked out of Honduras.
   A Contra political adviser who requested asylum said the
requests could send a misleading signal to the estimated 12,000
rebel troops languishing in border camps in Honduras.
   ``It could be demoralizing to the troops if we were seen as
retiring from the struggle,'' Francisco ``Johnny'' Delgadillo said.
``But the troops know that's not so. Our struggle continues.''
   Delgadillo also expressed anger over the Tela agreement.
   ``We don't want to live like slaves to the signature of the
presidents,'' he said. ``We want to go on being rebels.''
   Ortega's Sandinista government has agreed to democratic reforms
leading to national elections in exchange for the repatriation or
resettlement of the Contras by Dec. 8.
   While the Bush administration lobbied to keep the Contras intact
until Nicaragua's scheduled elections in February 1990, Washington
officials have reluctantly embraced the accord. Military aid to the
rebels was cut off by Congress in Febraury 1988.
   A complete list of the nine commanders was not immediately made
public, but others known to have to have requested asylum included
Jose ``Emmanuel'' Aguilar, a southern commander; Fremio ``Jimmy
Leo'' Altamirano, a northern commander, and Luis Angel Lopez.

   If Larry Coker seems less than himself
these days it's because the former 750-pound man has lost 575
pounds.
   Coker, now weighing 175 pounds, says he used to eat four
quarter-pound hamburgers, a bag of Doritos and two liters of pop as
a nighttime snack. A half pot of macaroni and cheese at one sitting
was another favorite indulgence.
   While a student at Royal Oak Dondero High School, he used the
freight elevator to attend classes on the second floor, and owned
only one T-shirt that fit him.
   Eating was a way of dealing with personal problems, including
the divorce of his parents, Coker said. ``Whenever I was nervous,
I'd eat. It was easier than talking about my feelings,'' he said.
   On Jan. 5, 1988, he decided to turn things around. Tired of
having to sit in a broken chair and having his brother put on his
socks and shoes, he began a medically supervised diet.
   His caloric intake is down from 6,000 daily to about 650. A
typical dinner is five ounces of poultry, unbuttered green beans
and a salad.
   ``I also try to eat an apple before each meal and drink eight
glasses of water a day,'' he said.
   He often roller-skates five miles.
   Nutrition experts caution the rapid weight loss poses some
health hazards.
   ``He lost the weight very fast, which is dangerous,'' said
Catherine Jen, associate professor of nutrition at Wayne State
University in Detroit. ``If you lose more than two pounds a week,
you run a medical risk of losing body protein and muscle mass.''
   The loss of muscle mass could result in a mineral imbalance,
which could cause cardiovascular problems.
   For Coker, the weight loss is a reason to celebrate. Friends and
family have planned a ``coming out'' party for him.
   ``We'll have lots of salad and carrots and he wants a fruit
bowl,'' said his mother, Barbara Coker.

   The dollar eased in quiet European trading this
morning and currency dealers said they expected it to remain in a
narrow range for the rest of the week.
   Gold prices rose.
   ``There is a lack of ideas'' moving the market, said Alfred
Zapfel, chief trader at the Bank of Boston in Frankfurt.
   The European market is particularly quiet because many traders
are on vacation and others are letting the U.S. market take the
lead, he said.
   ``If anything will happen, it will happen in the U.S.,'' agreed
a trader in Italy.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.20 yen to a closing 139.05 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 139.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.8902 West German marks, down from 1.9000
   _1.6295 Swiss francs, down from 1.6350
   _6.3920 French francs, down from 6.4050
   _2.1328 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1440
   _1,360.75 Italian lire, down from 1,364.40
   _1.1735 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1710
   In London, it cost $1.6285 to buy one pound, more expensive for
buyers than $1.6170 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at $365.75 a troy ounce, unchanged from
late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $366.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $366.30, up from $365 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.18 to close at $367.06.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.18 a troy ounce, up from
Wednesday's $5.15.

   A woman who abandoned her newborn in
a jetliner bathroom after giving birth on a flight from New Jersey
to San Francisco was sentenced to six months in jail.
   San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Margaret J. Kemp said that
despite claims of remorse, 25-year-old Christina LoCasto ``wished
the baby was just going to go away; that the baby would not be
found, not be found alive and not attributed to her ... it is
extremely fortunate that the child lived.''
   The red-eyed woman, six months pregnant with her fourth child,
cringed behind a lectern at her attorney's side as the judge ruled
``a jail sentence is appropriate in this case.'' She burst into
tears after Kemp read the sentence.
   The child, Alyssa, is in the custody of her paternal
grandparents, John and Frances LoCasto of New York City's Staten
Island, where the girl's mother also lives.
   Richmond County authorities, encompassing Staten Island, had
agreed to carry out the sentence of LoCasto, the judge said.
LoCasto was expected to begin serving time in October.
   The brown-haired, blue-eyed baby was discovered July 13, 1988,
under the bathroom sink of a United Airlines jet shortly after it
arrived at San Francisco International Airport from Newark. San
Mateo County sheriff's deputies traced LoCasto the next morning
through a passenger list.
   Mrs. LoCasto originally pleaded innocent to felony child
endangerment, but changed her plea to no contest in a plea bargain,
avoiding a trial. She could have received six years in prison if
convicted.
   LoCasto ``made a tremendous attempt to gain understanding of how
this could have happened ... I believe this is an isolated
situation,'' said her attorney, Richard Bennett, pleading with the
judge for probation.
   San Mateo County Assistant District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe
asked for a nine-month sentence.
   The San Mateo County Probation Department had recommended 60
days of probation.
   Mrs. LoCasto also was placed on 2{ years' probation and fined
$705. While on probation, she was ordered to undergo counseling and
other treatment.

<HEAD>Blind 12-Year-Old Wins State Writing Contest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ACWORTH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tonya Robinson has never seen a book, but
the blind 12-year-old wrote well enough to win an award at this
year's Georgia Young Author's Writing Exposition.
   Tonya was to receive the award for best writing by a fourth- or
fifth-grader during a state Board of Education ceremony today.
   She attributes her talent to her father, Thomas, who reads to
her virtually every day.
   ``When I was real little, my dad would teach me vocabulary, and
I loved that,'' Tonya recalled. ``And now, me and him will just
talk for hours and hours about history and all kinds of things.
When I try to understand something in school, I'll ask him about it
and he'll explain it and tell me even more about it.''
   It was Robinson who first pegged his daughter's winning story,
``The Mannerless King,'' as outstanding material.
   The story is about a village's efforts to reform the rude and
selfish King Herdman.
   ``When I read it, I said, `This is a winner, Ton.' It's a
beautiful story,'' Robinson said.
   The exposition judges, who didn't know that the blank spaces
between the lines of Tonya's story held her Braille patterns until
after the verdict, agreed.
   ``There was no favoritism in the selection,'' said Fred Johnson,
a state Department of Education English consultant who coordinated
the contest. ``The judges didn't know she was blind. They simply
considered her story most representative of good writing.''
   Tonya hones her story-telling skills when she babysits for her
six younger siblings in Acworth, 20 miles north of Atlanta. She
said keeping the youngsters in line with charming tales is easy.
   ``I just love to write _ about animals and people and all kinds
of things,'' said Tonya. ``My teacher, Miss Mary (Phagan, a
published author herself), helps me a lot, transcribing things from
Braille and encouraging me a lot.''

<HEAD>Emperor Swears in Kaifu, New Cabinet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Akihito today held a swearing-in ceremony
for new Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and his Cabinet, a group Kaifu
said had been chosen to help ``ensure a balance of voices from the
people'' as he seeks reforms.
   ``There are both political reform and tax reform, and I plan to
do both reliably,'' he said.
   Kaifu, 58, and his scandal-plagued Liberal Democratic Party face
an opposition-dominated upper house of Parliament for the first
time in the party's 34 years of governing Japan.
   Also for the first time, the Cabinet includes two women _ Sumiko
Takahara, a non-politician and economics specialist who is head of
the Economic Planning Agency, and lawmaker Mayumi Moriyama,
director of the Environment Agency.
   Women have been particularly angered by a new 3 percent sales
tax that the Liberal Democrats forced through Parliament last year,
and were seen as a major factor in the party's upper house defeat
July 23.
   Kaifu replaces Sousuke Uno, who served only 69 days as prime
minister before resigning to take responsibility for the election
losses. He also had been accused of keeping paid mistresses.
   If the opposition parties can form a coalition on key issues
such as abolishing an unpopular new sales tax, the Liberal
Democrats could be forced into concessions or a possible
legislative stalemate, which could force early elections for the
lower house.
   The Liberal Democrats hope Kaifu's administration can brighten
their image before those elections, which must be held by next July
at the latest.
   The opposition parties used their greater powers on Wednesday by
making Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi the upper house's
choice for prime minister.
   The lower house voted for Kaifu, the newly chosen leader of the
Liberal Democrats and, under the constitution, the lower house
decision prevails.
   After its induction in a ceremony at the Imperial Palace, the
new Cabinet held its first meeting today.
   Kaifu pledged Tuesday to reduce the influence of factions among
the Liberal Democrats, but other posts in the 20-member Cabinet
were carefully distributed among the main sub-groups within the
party.
   ``I want to let lots of fresh air in,'' Kaifu said of his
government after jogging in his neighborhood this morning.
   ``By listening to the voice of the people, I hope to reduce the
gap between the people and Nagatacho,'' he said, referring to the
government office area in Tokyo.
   ``For that reason I chose people from outside government. And to
ensure a balance of voices from the people, I highlighted the
appointment of women,'' Kaifu added.
   He said the Cabinet's motto would be ``dialogue and reform.''
   Kaifu was chosen to lead the party's rebuilding efforts because
of his relative youth and reform credentials. However, analysts say
enthusiasm within the party for reform has weakened now that the
Recruit influence-buying scandal is largely over.
   Kaifu has acknowledged receiving about $110,000 in political
donations from Recruit Co., but said they were legally reported.
Four other members of the new Cabinet and two new top party
officials also have said they received Recruit contributions.
   The company has been accused of giving political donations and
selling bargain-priced stock to leading politicians to obtain
favors.
   Kaifu must negotiate with opposition parties over a revision of
the sales tax that will acceptable to the public and he must decide
how to respond to continuing U.S. trade demands.
   Opposition from farmers, a traditional source of governing party
support, to more agricultural imports also was seen as factor in
the Liberal Democrats' loss in the upper house elections.
   Kaifu probably will visit the United States in early September
to meet with U.S. leaders, Kyodo News Service reported.
   It quoted unidentified Foreign Ministry officials as saying
Kaifu would assure President Bush that there will be no major
changes in Japanese foreign policy.

<TEXT>
   A master forger duped galleries with phony
Picassos, Dalis and Chagalls until one of the artists he copied
recognized a counterfeit, prosecutors say.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner on Wednesday credited artist Hiro
Yamagata with the break that led to the arrest of Anthony Tetro.
   ``The forger in this case is the single largest forger of
artwork in the United States,'' said Reiner, telling of a yearlong
undercover investigation that resulted in the seizure of 250
counterfeit paintings.
   Reiner spoke against a colorful backdrop of paintings that
mimicked those of Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall and
Yamagata.
   Tetro, 39, of Claremont, was arrested last month and freed on
$10,000 bail on charges of conspiracy to commit grand theft and 44
counts of forgery.
   Charged along with him is Mark Henry Sawicki, 31, an art dealer
who ran a gallery in Sherman Oaks and allegedly distributed Tetro's
forgeries to galleries in Beverly Hills, New York, Chicago and Boca
Raton, Fla.
   Reiner said Tetro, who drove a Rolls Royce, sold forgeries for
$20,000 apiece.
   The alleged scheme crumbled last year when Yamagata, a
34-year-old Japanese-born artist who lives in Bel Air, stopped at a
gallery while taking relatives from Japan on a tour of Beverly
Hills, Yamagata said.
   ``I didn't paint that!'' Yamagata exclaimed when relatives
excitedly told him his paintings were on display.
   Yamagata, whose watercolors sell for $6,000 and up, went to
police. Investigators posed as art buyers and swept through
galleries across the country, placing deposits on artworks, then
returning to seize the frauds, Reiner said.
   Two of the phony paintings were recovered from Japan, Reiner
said, indicating the forgery network may have been international.
   No galleries were charged. Reiner said they apparently were
unaware that the paintings were forgeries.
   ``Even the most sophisticated and honest gallery can be duped,''
he said.
   Yamagata, who speaks halting English, said he has been painting
since he was 7 and has worked since then to develop his distinctive
style.
   Of the alleged forger, he said: ``I hope he finds his own
style.''

<HEAD>UN Envoy's Mission Found No Clues to Higgins' Fate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secretary-general said he is ``almost
certain'' Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins is dead but that a
U.N. envoy sent to investigate Higgins' fate was unable to say when
or how he was killed.
   The envoy, Marrack Goulding, returned to New York on Wednesday
after a visit to Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, where he tried to
determine Higgins' fate and find his body.
   ``In spite of extensive conversations with various parties who
might be in a position to know the facts, Mr. Goulding could not
obtain definite proof of Col. Higgins' fate,'' the
secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar, told reporters on
Wednesday.
   ``Having heard his report, however, I have regretfully come to
the conclusion that it is almost certain that Col. Higgins is dead.
I shall continue to try to establish with certainly what happened
to him, and if my fears are confirmed, to recover his body.''
   A pro-Iranian group in Lebanon said July 31 it had hanged
Higgins in retaliation for Israel's refusal to free Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem clergyman kidnapped by Israeli
commandos July 28.
   Higgins' captors released a poor-quality videotape showing a man
who appeared to be Higgins hanging, but there was no way of telling
when he died. Some reports have said Higgins was killed last year.
   Higgins' wife, Robin, and the FBI say they believe Higgins is
dead. He was on U.N. peacekeeping duty when he was kidnapped Feb.
17, 1988, in south Lebanon.
   ``I can only repeat my profound sorrow and outrage at the tragic
fate of a courageous and dedicated officer who was serving the
cause of peace in Lebanon under the flag of he United Nations,''
Perez de Cuellar said.
   He said he assured President Bush he would ``remain in close and
continuous contact with all those who may be in a position to help
resolve this problem, as well as the wider problem of all the
hostages.''
   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, including eight
Americans.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Some Eastern Pilots Crossing Picket Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Eastern Airlines pilots
have crossed the picket line since the five-month-old strike began,
giving Eastern confidence it can meet its goal of 1,700 pilots for
its new schedule.
   The crossovers have come despite a union vote this week to stay
on strike as long as Eastern's current management controls the
airline.
   At least 365 pre-strike Eastern pilots have returned to work,
100 to 150 of them since Monday, according to company and union
officials. All but 220 of Eastern's 3,500 pilots joined a strike by
Eastern's Machinists launched March 4.
   During the walkout, Eastern has borrowed crews from Continental
Airlines, which like Eastern is owned by Texas Air Corp.
   But if pilots continue to stream back, the Miami-based carrier
may be able to rebound alone.
   ``Our needs are being met, and we will fill our pilot quota of
1,700 pilots,'' said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell. ``There's not
any question that we will be able to meet our schedule.''
   The union has kept the airline to 30 percent of its pre-strike
schedule of more than 1,100 daily departures. Eastern's goal is 800
daily departures by 1990. The airline expects to have 390 daily
departures next Tuesday.
   Ron Cole, a spokesman for the striking pilots, maintained that
the union isn't overly concerned with the crossovers.
   The returning pilots are ``creating a nightmare for Eastern,''
he said.
   Cole said that the pilots who are returning are not qualified to
fly aircraft Eastern has available and that friction between newly
hired pilots and returning pilots will hurt safety in the cockpit.
   ``We anticipate that a lot of the new hires will be leaving,''
Cole said.
   Eastern said relations between the former strikers and the new
pilots have been friendly.

<TEXT>
   Six people were killed and 25 wounded
today when Syrian and Christian forces exchanged artillery fire in
a barrage that pounded the residence of the Christian army
commander and Moslem neighborhoods.
   Police said gunners deployed in the Druse mountains southeast of
Beirut fired 240mm mortar rounds at the bomb-damaged presidential
palace of the Christian commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, in Baabda, a
Beirut suburb. The attack came one day after Aoun urged Moscow to
suspend arms supplies to Syria.
   The Syrian barrage also targeted the headquarters of Aoun's
20,000 mostlty Christian troops at the Defense Ministry in the
nearby Yarze suburb, said a police spokesman, who requested
anonymity in line with standing rules.
   An Aoun spokesman refused to say whether the commander was in
the palace, but he is known to spend most of his time in its
underground bunker.
   Aoun's gunners, deployed in the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave northeast of Beirut, responded by shelling Syrian artillery
emplacements in the Moslem Druse suburbs of Choueifat and the Aley
mountain resort.
   Police said at least six people were killed and 25 wounded in
the barrage that started around 11 a.m., shattering two days of
relative calm across the Syrian-Christian confrontation lines in
and around Beirut.
   The spokesman said no casualties were reported from the Defense
Ministry or the presidential palace, both damaged by previous
Syrian shelling. All personnel there work from bomb shelters.
   By police count, the five-month confrontation has killed 555
people and wounded 1,347.
   Beirut took the brunt of devastating shelling duels that have
forced all but 200,000 of its 1.5 million population to seek refuge
in safer areas in south Lebanon, the Bekaa valley and the
northeastern mountain resorts.
   The thuds of exploding shells echoed across the divided capital
as Moslem and Christian radio stations interrupted programs to
flash reports of the renewed shelling and to advise people to take
shelter at once.
   The police spokesman said Moslem and Christian civil defense
organizations ordered all their rescue teams on alert and canceled
vacations.
   Women carrying bags of vegetables, bread and bottles of drinking
water ran for shelter across west Beirut's Hamra commercial
thoroughfare, some of them with tears in their eyes.
   ``I shouldn't have left home in the first place,'' one woman
said as she dashed into a residential building near a Syrian army
outpost at the war-ravaged Commodore hotel, off Hamra.
   ``Do you have a bomb shelter?'' she asked the janitor. ``Yes,''
he replied, but the woman left after noticing a Syrian soldier
guarding the hotel entrance.
   ``She realized we might get shelled because the Syrians are our
neighbors,'' said the janitor, who refused to give his name.
   Shortly after noon the exchange expanded to residential
districts of Moslem west Beirut and the city's eastern Christian
sector. The police spokesman said shells were exploding in the
Moslem districts of Tarik Jedideh and Corniche Mazraa as well as in
the Christian district of Ashrafiyeh.
   The current round in Lebanon's 14-year civil war began March 8,
two days after Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-allied
militias south of Beirut to salvage $100 million annually in lost
customs dues.
   The Syrians and their allies retaliated by shelling and
besieging the Christian enclave, home for 1 million people.

<TEXT>
   An advocate of abortion rights has
apparently won the Republican nomination for a state Assembly seat
over five abortion opponents, with the counting of most absentee
ballots completed.
   Tricia Hunter had 14,822 votes, or 196 more than her closest GOP
rival, Richard Lyles, after 532 absentee ballots were counted
Wednesday. About 135 more ballots were to be counted today, not
enough to affect the outcome.
   The election Tuesday to fill a seat left empty by the death of a
legislator in June was the first state race since the U.S. Supreme
Court ruling last month giving states more latitude in restricting
abortions.
   ``I think the statement that came out of this race is that
voters want to know the candidates' position and they are not going
to let them waffle their position,'' Hunter said.
   ``The candidates are going to have to take one side of the issue
or the other. I've been pro-choice for a long time and I believe
it's an individual decision that a woman has the right to make.''
   Unless Hunter's apparent victory is somehow overturned, she will
advance to an Oct. 3 election against Democrat Jeannine Correia,
who bested one other Democrat in Tuesday's voting. Both Democrats
support abortion rights.
   The district is largely Republican _ 54 percent to 33 percent
Democrat _ making the GOP candidate an overwhelming favorite.
   ``I believe the abortion issue was the deciding factor in this
election,'' said Correia.
   Voters were free to pick from among six Republicans and two
Democrats on one ballot.
   If one of the eight had won 50 percent of the vote, he or she
would have won outright. Instead, there will be runoff between the
top vote-getter from each party.

   A freighter carrying a container of toxic waste
left Britain today after the country's largest port refused to
accept the cargo and officials at a second port said they would not
accept the shipment.
   Authorities at Tilbury, at the mouth of the Thames River,
Wednesday blocked the unloading of a container of polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs, from Canada carried aboard a Soviet freighter.
   A port spokesman, John McNab, said the decision was made ``out
of consideration for the work force and the local community.''
   Members of the environmental group Greenpeace had met the ship
Khudozhnik Saryan and placed poison warning labels on the hull as
it entered the port.
   Later Wednesday, authorities at Liverpool said they would reject
1,800 tons of PCB waste expected from Canada in the next few months.
   The Khudozhnik Saryan discharged all of its cargo except the
single container containing the PCBs.
   The ship left Tilbury early this morning for an unknown
destination. Port officials said it was returning to Montreal, but
some British news reports said it would first stop in another
unidentified European country.
   Sue Adams of Greenpeace said the group will track the ship's
course and alert environmentalists in Belgium if there were any
attempt to unload the container there.
   PCBs are disposed of by burning, but there is a danger that
highly toxic dioxin can be formed if the temperature is not high
enough.
   Paul Horsman, director of the Greenpeace Toxic Unit, called on
the government to revoke the licences of companies bringing such
waste into Britain. ``The UK is becoming the dumping ground of the
world,'' Horsman said.
   Allan Roberts, the Labor Party's spokesman on the environment in
the House of Commons, said Britain accepted 800,000 tons of toxic
waste last year.
   However, David Boyd, of the National Association of Waste
Disposal Contractors, said the figure was 80,000 tons. ``It is a
legitimate trade that is to the benefit of the environment as a
whole,'' Boyd said.

   Old Faithful is losing steam, according to
a Yellowstone National Park geologist who says the geyser may some
day shut off.
   The interval between eruptions has lengthened by about 14
minutes in recent years, said Rick Hutchinson.
   The geologist said in an interview Tuesday with the Jackson Hole
News that there was no way to predict when the geyser might stop
erupting but that scientists can tell from its cone that Old
Faithful has been dormant in the past.
   ``There could come a day in the far distant future, or not too
distant future, when Old Faithful will become less faithful and may
become a dormant geyser,'' agreed Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan
Anzelmo.
   Hutchinson, who has monitored geysers in the park for years,
said that for the first 100 years since Old Faithful's discovery in
1870, the average interval between eruptions was 65 minutes. Last
spring, it was 78.9 minutes.
   Earthquakes, vandalism and a buildup of natural deposits called
geyserite all can slow a geyser down.
   After a 1959 earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, the
interval between Old Faithful eruptions lengthened by more than
five minutes. A 1983 quake added seven minutes. A number of
moderate earthquakes have struck this year.
   Vandalism has turned off the steam at four geysers in the park.
People have thrown things into geysers that do not get blown out,
blocking the steam, Hutchinson said. However, people are prohibited
from wandering off the boardwalks at Old Faithful, which keeps them
about 100 feet from the spout.
   While the number of eruptions may be declining, the volume of
water spewing up and the height of the geyser have apparently not
changed, Hutchinson said.
   The geyser reaches about 130 feet and discharges between 3,700
and 8,400 gallons of 204-degree water each eruption.

<HEAD>Communist-Allied Party Talks With Solidarity About Forming Government</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Peasant Party leader meeting with
Solidarity, prime minister. Changes byline. No pickup.</HEAD>

   The Communist-aligned United Peasant Party
today met with Solidarity to consider its invitation to form a
governing coalition that would exclude the Communists.
   With Solidarity's 161 parliamentary seats and the Peasant
Party's 76, a Solidarity-Peasant alliance would have a bare working
majority of 237 votes in the 460-member parliament.
   If joined by the small Democratic Party, which also has been
linked to the Communists, the Solidarity-led coalition would have a
firm majority.
   The Democrats said Wedneday that they would like to discuss
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's invitation to join forces, but no
meeting has been scheduled.
   The talks between the Solidarity labor movement and the Peasant
Party today were held in private at Peasant Party executive
offices. Sen. Andrzej Wielowieyski and Sejm Deputy Jacek Kuron,
deputy chairman of the Solidarity caucus, were among those
representing Solidarity.
   They were joined by a handful of Peasant Party lawmakers,
including Aleksander Bentkowski, the party's parliamentary leader.
   ``We're at the beginning of the beginning,'' said Jaroslaw
Kaczynski, a Solidarity senator from Elblag, who attended the
hour-long meeting as Walesa's envoy. He said the talks would
continue.
   Earlier today, Bentkowski met with the new prime minister, Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak, a government spokesman confirmed.
   Peasant Party officials refused comment on the meeting.
   According to the opposition newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, the
meeting was for Bentkowski to inform Kiszczak that most of the
Peasant deputies in the Sejm, or parliament, would oppose a Cabinet
nominated by Kiszczak.
   Walesa said Monday that any government formed by Kiszczak would
only extend the Communists' 45-year-old monopoly on power. The
coalition he seeks would put the Communists in the opposition in
parliament.
   The Democrats and Peasants have been linked to the Communists
since the late 1940's.
   The Democratic Party said Wednesday the wording of Walesa's
proposal ``makes it difficult to take a final stand'' and that it
wanted direct talks to clarify the offer.
   The party said in a statement after a leadership meeting that it
was ``ready to participate in any government of national confidence
giving realistic hopes for overcoming the current stalemate and
improvement of the economic situation.''
   Solidarity's parliamentary floor leader, Bronislaw Geremek, said
Kiszczak is expected to present candidates to fill the Cabinet by
Aug. 24. ``Until then we have time for dialogue,'' he said.
   Bentkowski told state TV on Wednesday that his caucus is
``susceptible to Lech Walesa's proposition, and generally speaking
questions the appropriateness of its participation in the current
coalition'' with the Communists.
   The Peasant Party's constituents reacted negatively to
Kiszczak's election Aug. 2, he said.
   ``There are still two weeks before a final decision, but on the
basis of remarks presented so far, one may conclude that the club
will vote against the Cabinet presented by Gen. Kiszczak,''
Bentkowski said.
   Several deputies urged the party to reject a coalition with
Kiszczak on the ground that it would have no public support. Others
appealed for a coalition with Solidarity. ``The people are
revolting. They won't hold for long,'' said Tadeusz Sytek from
Ostrow Wielkopolski, western Poland.
   However, Sejm Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, a Peasant Party
member, told state TV that Walesa's offer seemed to be an
``extreme'' position and was ill-timed because a prime minister was
already chosen.

   A Contra rebel spokesman says fear of revenge
by Sandinista supporters will keep most of the approximately 10,000
combatants from going back to their divided homeland in Nicaragua.
   ``They don't trust the Sandinistas,'' spokesman Bosco Matamoros
said in an interview Wednesday. ``These people have seen farmers,
relatives, neighbors destroyed, killed by the state security.''
   The presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador
and Costa Rica reached an agreement Monday that calls for disarming
and disbanding the Contras based in Honduras by Dec. 5.
   In return, Nicaragua promised to guarantee democracy and allow
the Contras to return home.
   However, Matamoros said, ``We are not going to lay down our arms
after 10 years of promises based on lies.''
   Most of the Contras live in squalor at jungle camps inside
Honduras along the rugged mountains near the Nicaraguan border.
Most of the troops trekked into the safe havens last year after
Congress cut off military aid and barred the CIA from resupplying
the rebels by air inside Nicaragua.
   The United States has backed the rebels covertly or openly since
1981 in their fight to depose the leftist Sandinista government.
   Congress in March approved a $49.8 million non-lethal Contra aid
package that comes under review in November.
   Former Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams, a passionate
Contra supporter, said Wednesday that congressional Democrats will
try to use the review of the funds and the new Central American
agreement to ``try to starve the Contras into going back to
Nicaragua'' where they face an uncertain future because of the
country's ``communist government.''
   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee who has made several trips to Nicaragua, said
resettlement of the rebels would have to be decided on a
case-by-case basis.
   ``Some certainly can't go home or (they) would see no future,''
Sanford said in a telephone interview. ``Some would fear political
retribution and some would think it hard to make a living there.''
   He said the United States was ``obligated to relocate these
peope,'' but added, ``Our policy has to be somewhat flexible.''
   Many of the rebels are illiterate peasants who know little other
than the rural world of small farming.
   ``Thousands have suffered the loss of relatives, homes, to be
free men,'' Matamoros said. ``The idea is not to get a green card.
But you do have an obligation. We are not a disposable good that
the United States can disregard at will.''
   Some 50,000 people have been killed in the fighting, most of
them civilians in the rural northern mountains and central plains.
The years of battling have left deep scars in a nation where
families often split their loyalties down the middle, with brothers
literally fighting brothers.
   Matamoros cited as an example the Galeano family. Thirty members
fled Nicaragua to fight against the Sandinistas, who came to power
in a 1979 revolutionary war that ousted the Anastasio Somoza
dictatorship.
   ``They were small farmers who had nothing to do with Somoza,''
Matamoros said. ``Their land was expropriated. They lost
everything.''
   Family member Israel Galeano, who goes by the nom de guerre
Comandante Franklin, has been a Contra troop commander for years.
   ``He could not go home,'' Matamoros said. ``I think that every
night he would have to prepare for an ambush. And there are
hundreds such families.''
   In Miami, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said
Wednesday that Galeano was among nine Contras who requested
political asyslum in the United States. But The Miami Herald quoted
Galeano as saying he sought travel documents rather than residence
in the United States.
   The rebel spokesman said the Contras would face retaliatory
murders and human rights abuses is they went back to Nicaragua.
   ``We are not guessing,'' he said. ``We have seen 10 years of
Sandinista rule.''

   A man who was arrested for allegedly taking nude
photographs of two children has confessed to kidnapping and killing
one of four girls whose disappearance terrorized a Tokyo suburb,
police said today.
   Officers found a child's skull near a place mentioned by the
man, and the skull was being examined to see whether it was that of
Ayako Nomoto, the 5-year-old girl the man confessed to killing in
early June, police said.
   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it
was too early to decide whether the man should be charged as
Ayako's killer or whether he would be linke to the case of the
other three girls.
   Newspapers put out extra editions and television stations
extended news programs to cover the case. Television crews went
into the man's house to film his book and videotape collection, and
reporters interviewed his co-workers.
   Parents have been closely watching their children in Saitama
prefecture, just north of Tokyo, since the abductions began in
August 1988. Three girls have been found dead and one remains
missing.
   The police official said the man, Tsutomu Miyazaki, 26, was
arrested July 23 for allegedly forcing two elementary schoolgirls
to let him take nude photographs of them. The official said the
suspect was charged with indecent assault and that he will be
questioned further about the abductions.
   The official said the latest police search began after Miyazaki
told officers he had buried part of Ayako's body in a camping park
in western Tokyo.
   Five days after her disappearance, a girl's body without a head,
hands or feet was found at a public bathroom in a cemetery in
Saitama.
   The other three girls are:
   _Mari Konno, 4, who disappeared in August 1988. Her bones and
ashes, in a cardboard box, were placed in front of her home in
Saitama in February. A letter in the box said, ``Mari burned to
death.'' Letters sent later to her home and the national newspaper
Asahi Shimbun by a writer identifying herself as Yuko Imada claimed
responsibility for the abduction and murder.
   _Erika Namba, 4, whose naked and strangled body was found in
December in a campground 20 miles west of her Saitama home.
   _Masami Yoshizawa, 7, who was kidnapped in October and remains
missing.

   Residents are angry in the Brooklyn neighborhood
where an anti-drug crusader was fatally shot through her bedroom
window. They are also scared.
   ``On my block I see what goes on but I shut up,'' Marguerite
Wise said Wednesday. ``I'm afraid for my life and my kids.''
   Maria Hernandez, 34, a mother of three, was getting ready for
work about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday when at least five shots were fired
into her family's first-floor apartment. A bullet hit her in the
head; she died hours later.
   On Wednesday, her husband, Carlos, went ahead and testified
before a grand jury against a neighbor Mrs. Hernandez had accused
of drug dealing, a source said.
   ``That woman never hurt anybody,'' said Mrs. Wise, who lives
around the corner from the Hernandezes. ``She's trying to protect
her neighborhood, her kids.''
   Mrs. Wise said she is too afraid to complain to police about the
drug dealers that plague the neighborhood. ``You cannot open your
mouth,'' she said. ``You can't move noplace _ the rents are too
high. You don't like it but what are you going to do?''
   A patrol car had been driving past the Hernandez home about once
an hour since Saturday because the family had received death
threats from drug dealers.
   The three-story building was a burned-out shell when the
Hernandezes moved in four years ago. They completely renovated it.
A neighbor, Carmen Camacho, said they were always yelling at drug
dealers sitting on their stoop to move on.
   Ms. Camacho, who has lived on the block for 15 years and is
godmother to the Hernandezes' 3-year-old son, said she is afraid to
go outside, even to attend the block association meetings the
Hernandezes organized.
   Speaking in Spanish interpreted by her 13-year-old daughter, Ms.
Camacho said she has seen the neighborhood deteriorate _ when ``the
drug addicts moved in'' _ and saw some improvement come from her
neighbors' efforts.
   Hernandez, 33, went into the chambers of a grand jury Wednesday,
spending several hours there. A source who spoke on condition of
anonymity said he testified against next-door neighbor Raymond
Gonzalez, who is accused of stabbing Hernandez in the arm and
threatening him with a machine gun last month after Mrs. Hernandez
accused Gonzalez of selling cocaine in front of their house.
   Police say they have no suspects in the shooting. Gonzalez was
in custody over the stabbing at the time of Mrs. Hernandez's death.
   Hernandez had no comment when he left the grand jury room but
told The New York Times, ``I am going to stay here and keep
fighting the drugs, because of the kids and innocent people.''
   After the shooting, police stood guard at the Hernandezes'
building, mostly to protect the family from curious crowds and the
news media.
   While women with baby carriages gathered out front, a block
away, six or so dealers sold heroin with brand names like
``Terror'' and ``Steel Ball.''

   President Bush today renewed his appeal for
Americans to say a special prayer this weekend for the U.S.
hostages in Lebanon.
   Bush first issued the call on Wednesday at a meeting with
Cardinal Bernard Francis Law of Boston.
   The president said in a statement released by the White House:
   ``This Sunday millions of Americans of every faith will attend
worship services. We have much to give thanks for in this country.
But I ask that each of you say a special prayer this Sunday for the
American hostages being held in Lebanon.
   ``In the last several days, we have all struggled with the
reality of Americans being held in a foreign land, tortured and
sometimes killed by their captors. Even as we search for political
solutions to this problem, I believe that prayer is the most
important way to deal with the human response to this tragic
situation.
   ``I believe in prayer. It gives us strength in times of need. It
gives us hope in times of despair. It gives us optimism in times of
opportunity. So I ask again that each of you join me this Sunday in
saying a special prayer for the American hostages, their families
and their friends.''

   Israeli-backed militiamen raided houses
in Shiite Moslem villages in south Lebanon today to search for
suspects in a bombing that injured five Israeli soldiers and an
allied militiaman.
   Also today, the Beirut weekly Ash-Shiraa quoted unidentified
``non-Arab'' sources as saying armed women have been moving the
Western hostages to new hideouts in Beirut and its suburbs.
   A U.N. source said two Norwegian soldiers, serving with the
United Nations' peacekeeping force in south Lebanon, were slightly
wounded when they tried to stop militiamen of the Israeli-sponsored
South Lebanon Army from carrying out arrests in the southern
villages of Ibl El-Saqi and Rashaya.
   The source, who insisted on anonymity, said the militiamen threw
grenades at the Norwegian soldiers, who were manning a checkpoint.
   The Voice of the South, the radio of the South Lebanon Army,
said the militia rounded up several young Shiite men for
questioning in connection with Wednesday's bombing.
   It said most arrests were made in the village of Khiyam. Khiyam,
Ibl El-Saqi and Rashaya are in Israel's self-designated security
zone in south Lebanon, which is patrolled by the South Lebanon Army
and Israeli troops.
   On Wednesday, a Shiite Moslem clergyman detonated a truck bomb
in south Lebanon as an Israeli patrol passed by. Five Israeli
soldiers and an SLA militiaman were injured.
   The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah said the attack was to avenge
Israel's July 28 abduction of Sheik Abduk Karim Obeid, a
Hezbollah-affiliated cleric.
   Ash-Shiraa did not say whether the reported moving of the
Lebanese hostages was related to Obeid's abduction.
   The weekly said the hostages were transported in ``medium-sized
buses, equipped with every comfort _ beds and chairs. ... As for
the windows, they were curtained so no one could see anything
inside (the bus).''
   Ash-Shiraa said the ``women kidnappers'' in long black chadors
moved the hostages at night and were equipped with automatic
weapons to be used only under ``utmost necessity.''
   The report could not be independently verified.
   Ash-Shiraa gained international renown in November 1986 when it
broke the story of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in return for the
release of hostages. But its recent reporting on the hostages has
not been accurate.
   Ash-Shiraa did not say when the hostages were moved.
   There are 16 foreign hostages in Lebanon, _ eight Americans,
four Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and two West Germans. Most
are believed held by Shiite Moslem extremists loyal to Iran.
   Longest held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16,
1985.

   Police swinging whips and
batons broke up a rally by 500 trade union members outside a
courthouse today, and officials said at least 18 black
demonstrators were injured and 20 others were arrested.
   The union members, who were singing and dancing, marched about
two miles from a train station to the Kempton Park courthouse
outside Johannesburg before police chased them from the area, said
the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the nation's largest
labor federation.
   At least 18 people suffered injuries that required treatment at
Johannesburg Hospital, said federation spokesman Neil Coleman.
   Police arrested 20 demonstrators who failed to disperse, but
Capt. Ruben Bloomberg said he was unaware of any injuries.
   The march was staged in support of 27 workers ordered to appear
in court for allegedly singing freedom songs and dancing on public
trains.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions says more than 400 of
its members have been charged with disturbing he peace for singing
on trains since June. Most of those who have appeared in court
received fines.
   Today's court proceedings were postponed when the men ordered to
appear did not show up.
   The union said its members will continue singing on trains that
carry workers to and from their jobs in the cities and the outlying
black townships.
   ``We will continue in a spirit of defiance,'' said union
official Ariel Mabalane. ``They sing to popularize their campaign,
to express their feelings as the repressed and exploited.''
   The labor group is one of the leading members of the Mass
Democratic Movement, an anti-apartheid coalition that launched a
nationwide mass defiance campaign Aug. 2.
   In another labor conflict, 13,500 autoworkers remained on strike
in wage disputes at the Toyota, Volkswagen and South Africa Motor
Corp. plants.
   Toyota officials today described the strike as the worst ever in
the South African automaking industry.
   The autoworkers, most of whom belong to the National Union of
Metalworkers of South Africa, have been off the job since last week.
   The union is trying to negotiate a wage agreement on a
nationwide basis with all major auto companies. The strikes began
while negotiations were taking place and the companies have accused
the union of bad faith.

   Lufthansa airlines today
inaugurated the first scheduled flights between West Germany and
East Germany with an 80-minute trip from Frankfurt to Leipzig.
   Previously, the two German states were linked by air only twice
yearly, when special charters were arranged to take businessmen to
and from the biannual Leipzig trade fair.
   East Germany's Interflug airline has been authorized under an
agreement signed by officials from Bonn and East Berlin last month
to provide service between Leipzig and Duesseldorf, West Germany.
Weekly Interflug flights are expected to begin Friday.
   Flight LH6010, a Boeing 737, took off from Frankfurt airport at
9:13 a.m. with a host of dignitaries on hand to see the West German
carrier's first regularly scheduled flight to Leipzig.
   Lufthansa officials said earlier that the flight agreement runs
only through Oct. 31. The airlines want to determine the popularity
of the flights before agreeing on a permanent schedule.
   Officials on both sides of the border believe the new routes
will be popular, especially in light of the sharp increase in
travel between the two German states.
   More than 7 million visits to West Germany by East German
citizens were recorded last year, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, reported Wednesday that the travel
trends are growing.
   The Lufthansa-Interflug agreement required and received the
approval of the Allied powers, which continue to exercise some
jurisdiction over German air space.

<HEAD>Two Iowa Boys Get What They Want After Two Days on the Road</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than two days on the road, fueled
by pizza and financed by checks drawn on their father's account,
two Iowa boys got what they wanted in a hearing before a federal
judge in Washington.
   A D.C. Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday that the boys, aged
10 and 12, can live with their mother temporarily. Their father had
been given custody of the children after a 1985 divorce.
   The boys were missing for 56 hours as they traveled more than
1,000 miles on Greyhound buses, headed for their mother's home in
North Carolina, before they were stopped in the District of
Columbia last Tuesday.
   In an interview with The Washington Post, the boys described
their getaway from their father's home in Ames, Iowa, equipped with
two changes of clothes, a Sony Walkman and four blank checks.
   The boys, whose names have not been released, said they spent a
night in the Iowa woods before persuading a bank to let them write
a $300 check.
   ``I just went to the bank and told the guy I wanted $300 and he
told me what to write on it,'' said the 12-year-old.
   They bought bus tickets, and began a zig-zagging trip across the
Midwest.
   Their first meal on the road was $15 worth of pizza. ``We had it
for breakfast,'' said the younger brother.
   ``They were probably just jumping the bus from one station to
another, trying to figure it out as they went along,'' said John
Wick, a Greyhound sales agent.
   The boys' father and the Story County sheriff asked Greyhound
for help when their bicycles were found at the bus station.
Greyhound traced the boys to the District of Columbia an hour
before their bus arrived Aug. 1. A D.C. police youth division
officer was waiting for them.

<TEXT>
   The president of the Afghan rebels'
self-proclaimed government today branded his own foreign minister a
``killer'' of innocent Afghans and other guerrillas.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, president of the rebel
government-in-exile, said his regime would have a better chance of
survival without hard-line rebel leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, who
serves as foreign minister.
   Hekmatyar is leader of the powerful Hezb-i-Islami resistance
group.
   ``He considers himself the hero of the jihad (holy war), but in
fact he's a killer,'' Mojaddidi said in an interview. ``He has
killed hundreds of mujahedeen inside Afghanistan and hundreds of
innocent people inside Afghanistan.''
   Mujahedeen, or Moslem guerrillas, under Hekmatyar's command are
accused of killing 32 rebels of the rival Jamiat-i-Islami rebel
group in northern Afghanistan on July 9. Hekmatyar has admitted his
men's involvement in the slayings but said they were provoked.
   Jamiat leader Burhanuddin Rabbani has called for Hekmatyar's
suspension from the rebel government.
   The infighting threatens the unity of the rebel factions who are
fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government.
   ``This man is destroying Afghanistan,'' Mojaddidi said of
Hekmatyar. His party, the Afghan National Liberation Front, is
viewed as more moderate than either Hekmatyar's or Rabbani's.
   Asked whether the rebel government would be better off without
Hekmatyar, Mojaddidi replied: ``Why not?''
   Hekmatyar was not immediately available for comment. His chief
political officer, Abdul Qadir Karyab, said of Mojaddidi, ``We
think this man is mad.''
   He said the Hezb-i-Islami party had not decided whether to pull
out of the rebel government, as Hekmatyar threatened to do unless
it held elections inside Afghanistan and in refugee camps outside
the country.
   He indicated his party might continue as a member of the
government if an election commission already appointed came forward
with a schedule for the polls.
   The mujahedeen, the most powerful of which are headquartered in
Pakistan, are fighting to oust the Marxist government in Kabul and
establish an Islamic republic in Afghanistan.
   The rebels are united in their hatred of the communists but
differ widely on the nature of a Moslem government and the means to
achieve it.
   The ruling People's Democratic Republic of Afghanistan took
power in a 1978 coup that sparked the Moslem insurgency.

   Author and TV personality Art Linkletter was
reported in stable condition early today after being hospitalized
with chest pains.
   The 77-year-old humorist was taken by ambulance to the
University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center on Wednesday
night and was undergoing observation and tests, said nursing
supervisor Susan Davidson.
   ``He is fully alert, talking and laughing,'' Ms. Davidson said.
   The cause of his chest pains was not immediately known, she said.
   The entertainer was stricken at his house less than a mile from
the home of former President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, in the
exclusive Bel Air area.
   Linkletter hosted several popular radio and TV shows, including
``Art Linkletter's House Party'' and ``People Are Funny.''
   His books ``Kids Say The Darndest Things'' and ``Old Age Is Not

<TEXT>
   Musicians have voted to take a 9.8 percent pay
cut in a four-year contract designed to keep the Detroit Symphony
Orchestra alive.
   The agreement, approved 82-8 with one abstention Wednesday, was
reached Monday, said Wesley Jacobs of the Detroit Federation of
Musicians.
   ``We want to do everything we can to be a part of the
rejuvenation of the financial health of this orchestra,'' said
Jacobs.
   The musicians had one year left on their old contract, but the
orchestra sought a new one to reduce its debt, projected at $11.7
million this budget year. Under the new contract, the base annual
salary will drop to $47,694.
   The symphony missed a payroll last month and had threatened to
close until the Legislature appropriated $1 million in emergency
aid, received last week.
   The musicians say the 75-year-old orchestra, considered one of
the nation's top 10, is an important asset for a city fighting a
reputation for drugs and crime.
   The orchestra has blamed its financial problems on low
attendance caused by an inability to draw younger concertgoers and
blacks, who make up two-thirds of the city's population of 1
million.
   Several other U.S. symphonies also run at a deficit, including
those in Denver, Nashville, New Orleans and Pittsburgh.

   A French geneticist testifying in a
trial over the fate of seven fertilized human eggs said today that
leaving the embryos in cold storage amounts to putting ``tiny human
beings'' in ``concentration camps.''
   ``It's not as hospitable a place as the secret temple of a
woman's womb,'' Dr. Jerome Lejeune, director of research at the
French National Center of Scientific Research, testified in the
unprecedented divorce case of Junior Lewis Davis and Mary Sue Davis.
   The Davises produced seven fertilized eggs in an in vitro
fertilization clinic last year before their marriage broke up. Mrs.
Davis wants to become pregnant with them, while her husband does
not want them used without his consent. He said the embryos should
be treated as jointly owned property.
   A key distinction in the trial has been the characterization of
the eggs.
   Lejeune, who in 1959 discovered the genetic basis of Down's
syndrome, testified as an expert witness for Mrs. Davis that life
begins at the moment of fertilization. ``As soon as he has been
conceived, a man is a man,'' he said.
   Lejeune said: ``An early human being inside this suspended time
cannot be the property of anybody.''
   By ``putting tiny human beings in a very cold space, deprived of
liberty, deprived even of time, they are suspended, as it were, in
a concentration camp,'' the geneticist said.
   Lejeune also said embryos have individual characteristics
immediately upon conception.
   The geneticist testified at a trial in Silver Spring, Md., in
1984, in which a husband was trying to prevent his wife from having
an abortion. He argued life begins at conception because that is
when the genetic makeup is complete.
   The embryos in the Davis case have been fertilized for less than
two days and have developed to between four and eight cells.
Testimony at the trial indicated scientists do not consider
fertilized eggs ``embryos'' until the cells begin taking on varying
characteristics, usually from 12 to 14 days after fertilization.
   Mrs. Davis testified Tuesday she considers the embryos life. ``I
am the mother of these embryos,'' she said. ``They are the
beginning of life. They are more than just cells that mean
nothing.''
   She said leaving the embryos in cold storage, as her estranged
husband proposes, ``would be killing them.''
   Davis testified that he does not consider the cells as life. He
said he opposes abortion, but notes these embryos are not inside
any woman's body.
   At the conclusion of Tuesday's testimony, Mrs. Davis' attorney
said he was glad she had gotten to tell her side of the story.
   ``I think we're so accustomed in this country to women wishing
to terminate fetuses that we've never ever considered a woman who
would bare her soul to protect what she's created,'' Jay
Christenberry said. ``I think emotionally America is calloused to
this type of thought, and I think the more we wake people up to it,
the more they'll understand that we need to be more serious about
protecting the pre-born.''
   Blount County Circuit Court Judge W. Dale Young is expected to
rule in the case within a month.

<HEAD>Woman Arrested for Endangering Fetus By Swallowing Cocaine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A pregnant woman who police say stuffed
a quarter-ounce of cocaine into her mouth and swallowed it as she
was being arrested was charged with causing a risk of injury to a
minor.
   If Nellie Baez, who is four months' pregnant, is convicted, it
would overturn Connecticut case law that holds that a fetus is not
a person _ a question central to the abortion debate, authorities
said.
   But lawmakers, civil libertarians and John J. Kelly, the chief
state's attorney, doubted the charge would hold up in court because
of a 1986 state court ruling that a fetus is not a person.
   Baez, 20, was arrested Aug. 1 and arraigned Monday after being
hospitalized. She also was charged with cocaine possession and
tampering with evidence.
   Police said the fetus appears to be fine.
   Kelly said of the risk-of-injury charge, ``I don't see that as
fitting.''
   However, Kelly said the increasing incidence of cocaine-addicted
newborns will force lawmakers to consider of whether the state
should protect the fetus.
   In Rockford, Ill., a grand jury in May refused to return
manslaughter charges against a woman whose 2-day-old daughter died
allegedly from prenatal cocaine use. In Florida, at least two women
have been arrested under a drug-delivery law in the past year after
giving birth to babies with cocaine in their systems.
   Martha Stone, legal director of the Connecticut Civil Liberties
Union, said her organization would fight attempts to bolster a
fetus' rights over a woman's rights.
   ``Women have the constitutional right to privacy and the right
to procreate by choice,'' Stone said. ``If the criminal laws are
being used to accord fetuses rights and, in any way (protect
against) harm to the fetus, it interferes with the woman's absolute
right to privacy.''
   Anti-abortion activists applauded legal efforts to protect
fetuses, saying such cases will provide the push needed to overturn
abortion laws.
   ``I wish they'd consider every unborn baby at risk,'' said Mary
Ann Pressamarita, executive director of Defenders of the Unborn.

   Columbia's astronauts worked through
the third day of the shuttle's secret mission today as word came
from the Air Force secretary that they had successfully put into
orbit a powerful spy satellite.
   ``The United States now has a satellite in orbit as the result
of a very successful launch,'' secretary Donald Rice told a small
group of reporters after a ceremony at McDill Air Force Base in
Tampa, Fla.
   Rice made the disclosure Wednesday, but it was not generally
reported until today.
   ``I can say that was a very imporant day for the Air Force and
the nation's space program,'' Rice said when asked about the
reported deployment of the 10-ton satellite about seven hours after
Columbia was launched from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday. ``We were
extraordinarily pleased as were our colleagues in NASA that
everything went so well.''
   Asked about the satellite's purpose, Rice replied, ``I'm not at
liberty to say.''
   The satellite, according to sources close to the project, is
designed to snap highly-detailed photographs of military targets
over a large area of the globe, including most of the Sovet Union.
   There were indications earlier, but no confirmation, that the
satellite had been released on Tuesday. NASA, at the direction of
the Air Force, has kept a tight lid on information about the flight.
   Officials broke the official silence on Wednesday to report that
Columbia would return to Earth on Sunday between 9 a.m. and noon
EDT at Edward Air Force Base in California.
   The statement added that ``the crew is doing well and the
Columbia continues to perform satisfactorily.''
   The next planned announcement, if no problems occur, will come
Saturday, giving the exact landing time.
   Columbia's cargo bay also reportedly holds a package of
scientific instruments for military research, possibly for the
``Star Wars'' missile defense program.
   The astronauts, sources said, also were to conduct several
experiments aimed at defining the role of military observers in
space. The tests were to be coordinated with undisclosed ground
exercises that could include troop maneuvers, naval movements and
missile launches.
   Commanding Columbia's all-military crew is Air Force Col.
Brewster Shaw, a veteran of two earlier shuttle missions. The pilot
is Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, and the mission specialists are
Navy Cmdr. David Leestma, Army Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air Force
Maj. Mark Brown.
   The flight is the fourth dedicated solely to the Defense
Department. It is the 30th shuttle flight overall and the eighth
for Columbia, its first in 3{ years.

   President Bush is expected to nominate former
White House national security adviser Gen. Colin L. Powell as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, administration sources say.
   Powell, at 52, would become the youngest man, and the first
black, to become the nation's top military officer.
   The four-star Army general, who now heads the Forces Command at
Fort McPherson, Ga., would take over the prestigious position from
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who is due to retire Sept. 30.
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the White House was expected to make the
announcement today.
   In a statement anticipating the announcement, Sen. Sam Nunn,
chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, called Powell ``an
excellent nominee'' and said his panel would hold confirmation
proceedings soon after Congress returns from recess in September.
   Nunn, D-Ga., said Powell's ``proven abilities and his
experiences provide a sound foundation for his advice on
wide-ranging defense issues in times of severe budget constraints
and a rapidly changing international scene.''
   Gen. P.X. Kelley, who worked with Powell in the Pentagon before
retiring as commandant of the Marine Corps, once described him as
``a very extraordinary guy.''
   ``He can handle stress extremely well. He never gets rattled. He
was always a cool head,'' Kelley said.
   In the post of chairman, Powell would act as the principal
military adviser to the president and the secretary of defense.
   During the most recent hostage crisis, Crowe was a frequent
visitor to the White House, offering his assessment of the military
options available to Bush.
   Under a new management reform program instituted by Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, the chairman wields greater influence over
the Pentagon's budget and is able to advise the secretary of
defense on ``the full range of issues'' that come before him.
   The chairman also is allowed to offer his own opinion to the
president and defense secretary, eschewing past practice of only
passing on the opinion of the joint chiefs, who are in charge of
the various military branches.
   The selection of Powell would mean that the Army general would
leap over numerous more senior, and more experienced, military
officers. A leading candidate for the position has been Air Force
Gen. Robert Herres, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
   Powell distinguished himself in the highly visible White House
roles of national security adviser and deputy national security
adviser and was well-known to Bush during his tenure as vice
president.
   Powell was the first black to be named chief of the NSC when
President Reagan tapped him for the post in November 1987.
   He rose to the White House post after working with his
predecessor, Frank Carlucci, to reform the scandal-wracked office
in the days after the Iran-Contra affair.
   Pentagon officials expressed hope that Powell will be warmly
received in Congress. But his selection was expected by Pentagon
insiders to cause some ripples of discontent because he was named
only recently to the four-star level and lacks the broad experience
of many senior military officers who have held the post in the past.
   In speaking to groups of young blacks, he often warns them of
their duty to help others and to protect the gains of the civil
rights revolution.
   ``Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved
the way for you,'' he told Clark Atlanta University graduates this
spring. ``The greatest danger ... is complacency.''
   In heading the Forces Command since April, he was charged with
keeping the 1 million Army active, reserve and National Guard
troops in the United States ready for combat in defense of the
continental United States.
   Before his stint at the NSC, Powell commanded the Army V Corps
in West Germany for six months. Earlier, he was Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger's senior military assistant from 1983-86.
   Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City
and raised in the South Bronx.
   He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 after earning a
bachelor's degree in geology at the City University of New York,
and later earned a master's degree in business administration from
George Washington University. He served in the Office of Management
and Budget in 1972 during a term as a White House fellow.
   Powell served in Vietnam in 1962 and again in 1968, and holds
the Bronze Star for valor and a Purple Heart.

   The Roman Catholic Church said today it
has suspended plans to move nuns from a convent on the edge of
Auschwitz, and it blamed a ``violent campaign'' being waged by some
Jewish groups pressing for the move.
   In a statement carried by the official PAP news agency, Cardinal
Franciszek Macharski of Krakow said conditions do not exist for
carrying out a 1987 agreement to relocate the nuns to an
international prayer center, which has yet to be built.
   While not stating specifically that the relocation has been
permanently canceled, Macharski's statement made it appear the
project is blocked for an indefinite period.
   The World Jewish Congress, which has led efforts to bring about
the nuns' removal, called Macharski's comments ``brutal and
violent.''
   Macharski blamed a series of protests by Jewish groups at the
convent of Barefoot Carmelite nuns. Demonstrations outside the
convent, constructed in a former theater just outside camp wall,
intensified this year after a February deadline for moving the nuns
passed.
   In one highly publicized incident July 14, seven American Jews
protesting the convent were evicted by workmen on the site.
   Macharski said the February deadline set for moving the nuns was
``unrealistic'' to begin with. He said delays in the move ``caused
on the side of some Western Jewish communities a violent campaign
of accusations and slanders.
   ``Such attitudes and actions impede further realization of the
construction of the center. In this atmosphere of aggressive
demands ... there is no way of caring together for the construction
of a site of mutual respect.''
   ``At the foundation of an act of peace, there must be the wish
for the peace,'' he said.
   The World Jewish Congress said in Washington that Macharski's
remarks ``constitute a tragic blow to those of us in the Jewish and
Catholic world who have worked so long to foster mutual
understanding and respect.''
   Work still has not begun on the international prayer center,
although church officials said they were in the process of buying
land for it.
   Jewish groups have said the convent and the placement of
religious symbols at Auschwitz, including a 23-foot-high cross, is
deeply offensive to them. An estimated 2.5 million Jews were killed
at the camp during Hitler's drive to annihilate Jews.
   Poles, who are overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, argue that tens of
thousands of Polish Catholics including nuns and priests, died at
the camp and that the nuns should be allowed to pray for them at
the convent.
   Local residents have opposed moving the nuns.

   Leftist rebels today plowed

post in the capital with grenades and automatic weapons,
authorities and witnesses said.
   Sgt. Arturo Melendez, who was commanding the Mejicanos post when
the rebels attacked at dawn, said one soldier and one civilian were
wounded.
   Another guerrilla squad ambushed a truck carrying National Guard
members to reinforce the Mejicanos post, killing one trooper and
wouding two, authorities said.
   Melendez told journalists about 30 insurgents fired
rocket-propelled grenades at the post in northern San Salvador and
sprayed it with automatic weapons fire.
   The attack began when several guerrillas aboard a dump truck
smashed through a roadblock serving as the post's perimeter. The
rebels also fired a grenades at the Mejicanos Town Hall, destroying
its door.
   Leftist rebels are waging a nearly 10-year-old revolution

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's military government has released
17,877 prisoners held on criminal charges after a recent amnesty,
the official Working People's Daily said Thursday.
   Western diplomats and an opposition party spokesman said,
however, the government also has arrested thousands of political
dissidents.
   Under an amnesty announced July 20, death sentences for criminal
offenses were commuted to life imprisonment, life terms were
reduced to 10 years, and all others were cut by two thirds.
   Cases under trial against people arrested before the military
takeover Sept. 18 were to be dropped and those serving sentences of
under two years were to be immediately released, the order said.
   The amnesty does not apply to cases of treason or breaches of
martial law, which was imposed during the takeover to prevent open
political dissent.
   Rangoon-based Western diplomats contacted by telephone from
Bangkok on Wednesday said the military had arrested up to 3,000
people on political charges since July 20 after putting under house
arrest Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, the leaders of the main
opposition party the National League for Democracy.
   Diplomats and dissidents said that in the time between the army
takeover and the latest wave of arrests up to 3,000 more people may
have been arrested.
   Martial law forbids political gatherings of more than five
people. Military tribunals already have sentenced to death three
members of the National League for allegedly planning a bomb
attack. Five youths were given five-year jail terms for shouting
slogans during an anti-government protest July 17.
   During last year's mass protests for democracy, authorities also
released thousands of criminals on to the streets. Diplomats said
the move was aimed at convincing the people of the need for a tough
army presence.
   They also speculated that authorities may want to clear space in
the jails to make way for newly arrested political prisoners.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development on Thursday said it would award $10 million in grants
to provide permanent housing for the handicapped homeless.
   The money, awarded after competitive bidding, will go to 66
projects in 21 states and the District of Columbia, HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp said.
   ``President Bush and I are committed to ending the appalling
tragedy of homelessness,'' Kemp said in a statement.
   The grant program was authorized by Congress in the McKinney
Homeless Assistance Act, named after the late Connecticut Rep.
Stewart McKinney.
   The states getting the grants to help the handicapped homeless
must match the HUD money with an equal or greater amount of state
and local funding.
   The 66 projects were selected from 102 applications totaling $21
million. Grants totaling $9,947,189 were authorized, HUD said.
   The grant money can be used to buy or rehabilitate buildings to
use for permanent housing and to provide technical assistance and
operating funds to non-profit organizations that sponsor the
projects.
   Under program guidelines, the money can be used to provide
housing to handicapped who currently are homeless or deemed in
danger or becoming homeless. People with physical or mental
impairments are eligible for the program.

   The captain of a U.S. warship that

   The next one might be a call by Soviet warships at the West
Coast of the United States, said Cmdr. Ronald C. Bogle, captain of

   The Kauffman has anchored at the Bosporus strait, which splits
Istanbul, on its return from Sevastopol last week. It will head for
the Mediterranean, where the U.S. 6th Fleet is based.
   The vessel was escorted by the guided missile cruiser USS Thomas
S. Gates on the first U.S. naval visit to that port since World War
II and the first to any Soviet port since 1975.
   Thousands of Soviets welcomed the U.S. sailors, showering them
with gifts and attention.
   ``This was absolutely the best port visit I have had in my 18
years in the navy,'' Bogle said. ``Neither side could understand
why this was not done sooner.''

   Unknown vandals toppled and
stole part of an eight-ton World War I statue Thursday in the Jura
region, which is known for periodic violence by separatists.
   Police said there were no immediate suspects or claim of
responsibility for the pre-dawn attack, carried out with the aid of
a pulley and a steel cable. The stone statue of a soldier was
missing its head and part of the bayonet after the attack, police
said.

an almost identical attack on the monument at Les Rangiers, which
commemorates the Swiss army's mobilization at the time of World War
I.

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Airlines DC-10 carrying 256 people
made an emergency landing in Denver after its tail engine
apparently began breaking up. Officials said they found
shrapnel-like holes in the engine cover.
   The incident resembled the engine failure that preceded last
month's crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, in
which 111 people died.
   Flight 308 from Los Angeles to Minneapolis landed safely at
Stapleton International Airport about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, said
airport spokesman Richrad Boulware. There was no apparent damage to
its hydraulic controls, unlike the Iowa jet.
   Less than 30 minutes earlier while cruising at 39,000 feet, the
crew reported a loss of oil pressure and severe vibration in the
tail engine and shut it down, said Greg Feith, spokesman for the
National Transportation Safety Board.
   A 13-member NTSB investigative team from Washington was sent to
Denver.
   Accidents that do not involve fatalities or serious damage to
aircraft normally are investigated by regional offices, but the
Northwest failure was ``too much of a coincidence,'' Feith said,
referring to the Sioux City crash.
   In Washington, however, Federal Aviation Administration chief
James B. Busey said officials ``know of no hard facts that would
lead us to take action to ground DC-10s.''
   Busey said he did not have enough information to compare the
incident with the crash in Sioux City. But he said the DC-10 is
``safe to fly. I would fly in the aircraft today.'' He called it a
``comfortable, good-performing'' airliner.
   A government-industry task force looking into possible design
changes in the DC-10 and other wide-body airliners was holding its
first meeting today, Busey said. The FAA formed the group after the
Iowa crash and said it was also in response to incidents several
years ago involving a Boeing 747 and a Lockheed L-1011 in which
engine failures caused damage to aircraft control mechanisms.
   At least 18, or about 4 percent, of the 445 DC-10s built have
been involved in accidents, FAA figures show. That is a higher
percentage than for Boeing 747s or Lockheed L-1011 jumbos.
   Busey said the Northwest incident was an example of ``the way
the system should work'' because the pilots quickly shut down the
engine, diverted to a nearby airport and landed safely with no
injuries.
   ``We heard a loud noise,'' said passenger Don Burnett. ``It was
a boom and a shudder. We couldn't see it. We just felt it,'' he
said. ``Someone said something was hanging from the engines.''
   ``They experienced a severe vibration from the No. 2 engine,
(and) as a precautionary measure, they elected to make an
unscheduled landing,'' said Kevin Whalen, a spokesman for the St.
Paul, Minn.-based airline.
   The No. 2 engine is mounted in the aircraft's vertical
stabilizer, just above the tail wing. On United's Flight 232, the
No. 2 engine disintegrated, shooting shrapnel that apparently
severed hydraulic lines used to control the jet. The investigation
into the cause of that crash is continuing.
   Boulware said there were ``multiple shrapnellike holes in the
outer cowling'' or cover of the No. 2 engine.
   ``One of the holes was big enough I could have stuck my hand
through,'' he said.
   Boulware said he also saw broken turbine fan blades inside the
engine, and that the engine's tail cone was missing.
   But he added, ``We can't draw any comparisons to the Sioux City
flight. We don't know exactly what happened.''
   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said there were two small holes
in the engine's cowling. He said Northwest DC-10s are equipped with
Pratt and Whitney engines, unlike the United jet, which used
General Electric engines.
   The DC-10 has one engine under each wing in addition to the tail
engine.
   The DC-10-40 model plane was one of 22 purchased by Northwest,
Gibbons said. It was built in 1972, airline officials said. They
said they had no immediate information on the performance history
of the plane or the No. 2 engine.
   Whalen said the landing was normal in terms of controlling the
airplane. The 245 passengers were being placed on alternate flights
to Minneapolis, he said. There also were 11 crew members on board,
he added.
   Passenger John Ophoven, a Minneapolis businessman returning home
with his family from a vacation at Disneyland, said the plane
``just shook a lot.
   ``The pilot said the hydraulics were fine, and they had all the
steering,'' said Ophoven. ``The vibration lasted a minute or two.
   ``We dropped fast for a little while. It never really tipped. It
slowed down. Then it smoothed out.''

   ``We worked for the better to come,''
said Arnold Small. ``We knew it was a good thing we were doing.''
   What Small and tens of thousands of others were doing in the
early years of the century was digging the Panama Canal, the
waterway that joined the Atlantic and Pacific oceans 75 years ago
on Aug. 15.
   Small was 24 in 1914, when the first ship sailed through.
   ``I helped build the canal. That is a wonderful thing to
remember,'' Small said in an interview as he watched an honor guard
place a wreath on a monument to the thousands of workers who died
during a failed French attempt to build a canal in the 19th century.
   Small sat in a wheelchair on the side of a small hill in the
steamy heat of the green, lush woods on the banks of the canal near
the Pedro Miguel Locks.
   Small was born in Barbados and, like thousands of fellow
islanders, came to Panama to find work. He later fought with the
British army in Europe during World War I before returning to
Panama.
   Only Small and a few companions survived those days of malaria,
yellow fever, picks and shovels, sweat, blood, dynamite and wages
of 10 cents an hour.
   Men came by the thousands from Barbados, Jamaica, Ireland, the
Basque area of Spain, Greece, Barbados and many other lands, to
work under American bosses and engineers.
   They dug the canal, damming a river to create a huge lake and
building the system of locks that raises ships in 1,000-foot
waterbeds 85 feet above sea level and lowers them 50 miles away.
   There were only a little more than 300 Panamanians actually
digging.
   ``Even then we had started our service-oriented economy,'' canal
deputy administrator Fernando Manfredo said, smiling. ``We had
thousands (of Panamanians) providing food, lodging, water and other
services to those who actually dug the canal.''
   Thousands died in accidents in the days when health insurance
was unknown and liquor was the medicine that made pain go away.
   ``In those days all of us had to drink quinine almost every day
while working,'' said Constantine ``Parky'' Parkinson.
   ``When the rainy season came it fell for weeks, sometimes for
months, One's working clothes had to be worn every day for days wet
because there was no sun to dry them. One had to wash his own
clothes and keep the camp clean,'' said Parkinson, 94, who came
from Jamaica.
   ``On the Fourth of July we got a free train to take us to Panama
for the celebration,'' he said. ``There was plenty of free food and
cool drinks.''
   ``I remember my grandmother talking about how when Halley's
Comet was passing by (in 1910), everybody was saying that all were
going to be killed, so a bunch of Spanish workers decided to get
drunk out of their minds and die that way. All they got was a
hangover,'' Manfredo said.
   ``We made Panama a gateway to the world,'' Small said. ``My
brother, Walter, brought me here and I started as a water boy in
1911. I am a lucky man. Others younger than me are in worse shape.
I thank God I am alive.''
   Parkinson lost a leg during construction. Until recently, he had
been campaigning for more benefits for non-U.S. citizens who worked
on the canal.
   ``It was a labor force that had pride in what it did. ``It is a
tradition that our workers still hold,'' Manfredo said. ``During
the worst time of the political disturbances here last year,
absenteeism of canal workers was at its lwoedt.''

<HEAD>Settler Population Up Despite Uprising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The population of Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories is 6,500 higher than last year, despite the
20-month-old Palestinian uprising, the government said.
   The figures, released Wednesday by the government-run Central
Bureau of Statistics, show that Jewish settlements grew almost 400
percent more than Jerusalem, the second-fastest growing area.
   The growth rate has, however, slipped since the uprising against
Israeli rule of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip began 20
months ago.
   Settler leaders attributed the continued growth to right-wing
activists moving to the occupied lands in a show of Jewish resolve
to hold onto the disputed lands.
   Noam Arnon, a spokesman for the Gush Emunim settler movement,
said settlers who move to the territories want to ``give a positive
answer to the uprising.''
   Left-wing legislators expressed skepticism about the government
figures. Critics said some Jewish nationalists bought homes in the
territories to boost population figures but did not move to the
area.
   Dedi Zucker, a legislator from the leftist Citizens Rights
Movement, also said the figures do not reflect those who leave the
settlements but do not legally change their addresses.
   Independent observers said the settler population may be higher
than the government figures. Most also said both leftists and
rightists have tried to skew the figures.
   The Bureau of Statistics reported that 66,500 Jews lived in the
occupied territories in late 1988, an increase of 10.3 percent over
1987.
   According to the bureau, 2,500 of the new residents were
accounted for by the number of births over deaths, while 4,000
people moved to the area.
   In 1986, the year before the outbreak of the Palestinian
uprising, the settler population increased by 15.8 percent, the
bureau said.
   Many observers attribute the slower growth to the uprising,
which has seen constant stoning and firebombing attacks on
settler-owned cars.
   At least 531 Palestinians and 38 Israelis have been killed in
the revolt, which began in December 1987.
   The bureau did not survey the Palestinian population, but past
figures show 1 million Arabs in the West Bank and 700,000 in the
Gaza Strip.
   At least 80 percent of the settlers are commuters who take
advantage of government-subsidized housing in settlements near
Israel, observers said.
   Arnon said that among many committed Jews, the uprising actually
provided an incentive to move into the territories.
   ``Many people who were unsure of whether to move into a
settlement or not did so last year because of the security
problems,'' he said. ``Whoever thinks the nation of Israel is
moving out of here had better wake up.''
   The United States considers the more than 130 Jewish settlements
in the occupied territories an obstacle to peace. U.S. policy calls
on Israel to give up occupied land, seized from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East war, in exchange for peace.
   Meron Benvenisti of the independent West Bank Data Base Project
said his figures showed the settler population was closer to 74,000
at the end of last year, up from 67,000 in 1987.
   Benvenisti said his figures are higher because the government
does not take into account Israelis who move to settlements without
legally changing their addresses so their children can attend
better schools in Israel.
   He said the growth was abetted by new roads built by the army
that made commuting faster and avoided Arab towns.

   Thunderstorms rumbled across the deserts of California, Nevada
and western Arizona early today, flooding homes and roads, causing
mudslides and setting palm trees on fire with lightning.
   Yuma, Ariz., received 3{ inches of rain Wednesday night, 1{
times its normal rainfall for the entire year. It was the second
major rainfall in two weeks in a town where the average annual
rainfall is one of the lowest in the nation _ a little more than 2{
inches.
   The thunderstorm began with gusty winds that stirred up dust and
sand and reduced visibility to half a mile at times. The heavy rain
that followed further reduced visibility to a few hundred feet.
   The storm severed communications in much of Yuma, damaged a key
water main and caused mudslides and major flooding. About a foot of
water covered the runway at the airport.
   ``Most of our roads are gone. Lots of homes have water in them
and we've got poles and wires down,'' said sheriff's Deputy Kevin
Kretchmer. Some cars were washed away by floodwaters, but all
motorists were believed safe, he said.
   The Red Cross opened a shelter in a National Guard armory and
took in more than 40 residents of a flooded area, officials said.
   In east-central California, roads in the Benton area of Mono
County had to be closed after they were covered with water 2 feet
deep. Some people had to be rescued by helicopter, officials said.
   In the desert resort of Palm Springs, Calif., several palm trees
caught fire from lightning bolts and power was knocked out in some
areas when the storm rumbled through late Wednesday, said police
Sgt. Mike McCracken.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered over
western sections of the central Plains, especially near the
Kansas-Colorado line. Showers also extended along coastal sections
of the south Atlantic states.
   High pressure over the north Atlantic states dominated the
weather across most of the eastern half of the nation. Skies were
clear early today from New England across the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys to much of Texas.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from Florida to the southern and Middle Atlantic coast states;
showers and thunderstorms across the Rockies, the central and
southern Plateau and the Desert Southwest; and sunshine throughout
the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were forecast to be in the 70s from the upper Ohio
Valley across the Appalachians to much of the Atlantic coast; in
the 60s or 70s along the Pacific Coast; in the 90s over the Florida
Peninsula, southern Texas, portions of the northern Plains, the
southern Plateau and interior valleys of California and Oregon;
above 100 degrees over the Desert Southwest; and in the 80s
throughout the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 46 degrees at Bradford,
Pa., to 85 degrees at Phoenix.

   A Trump Shuttle jet carrying 56 people skidded to
a halt with a spray of sparks and smoke today in an emergency
landing at Logan Airport after its nose wheel failed to extend. No
injuries were reported.
   Fire equipment circled the plane and sprayed it with foam after
the Boeing 727 from New York's LaGuardia Airport ground to a halt.
Passengers slid down emergency chutes and walked to a waiting bus
for a ride to the terminal.
   ``When they first said they had problems, everybody was just
kind of joking about it,'' said a passenger, Charlie Cormay of
Sudbury. ``Once we realized there was going to be a crash landing,
everybody got pretty solemn.''
   As the plane came in for a landing, Cormay said, ``a few
prayers'' went through his mind. ``I looked out the window and saw
all the emergency vehicles. That's when I realized it was actually
pretty serious.''
   Before the landing, the plane circled nearly an hour, dumping
fuel. The pilot also tried to shake the wheel loose from its
housing by dropping the plane onto a runway, but the attempt failed
and the jet took to the air again.
   ``They made one sweep but it didn't shake loose,'' said Greg
Sullivan, 19, who watched the attempt.
   The plane circled several more times before smoothly dropping
its wing wheels to the runway in a gentle, but ungainly, landing,
its nose scraping the pavement.
   Passengers were told to put their heads in their laps as the jet
came in.
   ``They prepared us very well. By the time we landed, we were all
very happy and relieved,'' said Kathy Hussey of New York City.
``Suddenly you were on the runway with foam on your face and on
your back.''
   ``You prepare yourself for the worst,'' said another passenger,
Glenn Porter of New York. ``But it was really just like a rough
regular landing.''
   The jet carried 49 passengers and seven crew members, said Dee
Clark, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Port Authority, which
operates Logan.
   Developer Donald Trump inaugurated the Trump shuttle service
June 8 after buying planes and landing rights from Eastern Airlines
for $365 million. The shuttle operates between New York, Boston and
Washington.
   It was the second emergency landing in a little over a week in
the United States involving a landing gear problem.
   On Aug. 2, a Piedmont Airlines Boeing 737 with 100 people aboard
scraped its wing and engine at Greensboro, N.C., after its left
main gear jammed. No one was injured.

<TEXT>
   Rescue crews searching for a plane
that disappeared with U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland and 13 other people
on board were told today that a weather satellite detected an
emergency signal from an airplane.
   James Haley, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy, said the faint
locater signal was picked up by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration orbiter and was coming from an area 130 miles
south-southeast of Addis Ababa, the capital.
   Haley said the region is well outside the area rescue workers
have been searching since Monday, when the twin-engine plane
carrying the Texas Democrat and his party disappeared in remote,
rugged country near the Sudanese border.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said a U-2
reconnaisance plane allowed to fly over the area Wednesday had
taken pictures of the region but that the photographs had not been
developed.
   He also called the report of the signal ``very preliminary.''
   Haley said it would probably be several hours before anyone
reached the site of the signal because it was dark and the signal
came from rough terrain.
   ``We're talking about 20 miles in rough country,'' he said in a
telephone interview, adding that the road conditions in the area
were not known.
   Officials in Goba, 200 miles southeast of the capital, were
instructed to dispatch searchers to the site immediately, Haley
said.
   Most commercial aircraft carry radio transponders that send out
a signal allowing the plane to be located in the event of an
accident.
   Those signals, and similar ones broadcast by ships, are tracked
by weather satellites in a search-and-rescue system operated by the
United States, the Soviet Union, France and Canada.
   James T. Bailey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said in Washington today: ``We got one signal on one
satellite pass (Wednesday night). There is no way to be sure it is
coming from that aircraft.''
   Bailey said subsequent satellite passes have not been able to
confirm the signal because of radio interference.
   While satellite officials cannot be sure the signal they
received was from Leland's plane, ``We are treating is as if it
is,'' he said.
   Leland, chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, set
out Monday morning aboard a Twin Otter aircraft to visit the
Fugnido refugee camp, 480 miles southwest of the capital.
   Also aboard were three members of Leland's staff; a friend; four
Americans from the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Agency for
International Development; and five Ethiopians, including three
government officials, the pilot and co-pilot.
   Weather along their route was bad, with heavy clouds and low
visibility.
   Reports of a light plane circling two dirt landing strips in the
remote, mountainous highlands of southwestern Ethiopia reached the
capital shortly after Lelend's plane was reported missing Monday
evening.
   John Guerra, an embassy official in Addis Ababa, said this gave
searchers hope but added, ``We have to reiterate that these areas
are so islated they could have put down anyplace.''
   He described the region as ``without any communication,
virtually no roads and sparsely populated.''
   The search area was expanded Wednesday to include parts of Sudan
south of Fugnido and covered more than 24,000 square miles.
   Two U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules cargo planes arrived today
from West Germany and immediately joined the search.
   Guerra acknowledged the possibility that Leland's plane could
have slammed into one of the many mountains along its path, some of
which are higher than 12,000 feet.
   ``But the only reports we've had is of planes circling fields,''
Guerra said, suggesting the plane got past the most rugged terrain
and into an area where an emergency landing would have been easier.
   Robert Houdek, U.S. charge d'affairs in Addis Ababa, said there
still was cause for optimism because Leland's plane was a ``great
bush aircraft'' capable of landing in close, rough terrain.
   He said the pilot, Assefa Gebre-Giorgis, was ``the best damn
bush pilot in Ethiopia'' and knows his country ``like the back of
his hand.''
   Fugnido is one of four refugee camps in southwestern Ethiopia
run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. It houses more than
300,000 Sudanese who have fled famine and civil war in their
country.

<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. officials don't want people buying
little bottles of ``Mad Scientist Magic Powder'' because it might
just make them think there's ``coke'' in their Coke.
   The ``Magic Powder'' is a powdered bubble gum produced in Italy
and distributed in this country by Alma-Leo U.S.A. Inc., of
Northbrook, a Chicago suburb. The company sells it in tiny plastic
bottles that Coca-Cola officials say are shaped like their old soda
bottles.
   The soft drink giant sued Alma-Leo, and briefs in the case were
heard Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge James Moran.
   Coca-Cola maintains that the bubble gum's packaging may create a
connection between their product and cocaine.
   ``Think about it _ `magic powder' being sold in a `Coke' bottle.
What's the implication?'' asked Randy Donaldson, manager for public
relations for Coca-Cola.
   While an extract of the coca leaf is used as a flavoring in
Coca-Cola, Donaldson said cocaine itself is not, and never has
been, an ingredient in the soft drink.
   Floyd A. Mandell, attorney for Alma-Leo, said he thinks
Coca-Cola is overreacting.
   ``It doesn't even look like cocaine, it looks like powdered
candy,'' Mandell said. ``There's yellowish-white powder in the
little yellow bottles and pink powder in the little pink bottles.
You chew it and it turns into bubble gum and changes color.''
   Mandell said Alma-Leo is a small, privately held company which
sells novelty candy products manufactured by other concerns.
   The lawsuit accuses Alma-Leo of trademark infringement, unfair
competition and consumer fraud. Donaldson said the company wants
Moran to issue a cease-and-desist order on sales of the plastic
bottles and is seeking monetary relief in an amount to be set by
the court.
   Sales of the bubble gum have been suspended while the judge
considers the briefs.
   Donaldson said the ``Magic Powder'' bottles appear to be
miniature versions of Coca-Cola's old 6{-ounce bottles. ``The shape
of those bottles is trademarked,'' he said.
   Mandell, however, calls them nondescript ``contour bottles'' and
says there is no direct resemblance to Coca-Cola's.
   ``It's ridiculous to think Alma-Leo wouldn't arrange a copyright
or a trademark agreement if they thought one was needed,'' he said.
``They did for the Ghost Buster candy they sell.''
   Mandell said Alma-Leo also sells Creepy Crawlies, Skull Crushers
and ``the gummy worm type of candy.''
   He said the company offered to stop selling the bottles once the
current three-month supply runs out, but Coca-Cola wasn't
satisfied, and demanded that no more of them be sold.
   ``You're talking about several hundred thousand dollars in
merchandise,'' Mandell said. ``Not being able to sell it could be a
crippling blow to a company this size.''

<HEAD>Minorities Clash over Council Representation Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special election set for Saturday could change
the racial makeup of the mostly white city council, but minorities
who say the panel favors the white and wealthy fear a further
erosion in their political power.
   Racial tensions have been rising over charges of police
brutality, unfair housing practices and unequal representation.
Minorities comprise more than half of Dallas' population, but there
are only two non-whites on the 11-member council.
   Hoping to ease those tensions, city leaders have offered a
proposed charter change to add two single-district seats, plus four
others representing city quadrants, to give minorities a louder
voice in local government.
   The plan ``provides tremendous opportunities for the racial and
language minorities,'' said Ray Hutchison, a white attorney who
heads the Dallas Citizens Charter Review Committee.
   Minority opinion is split, but many Hispanics and most black
activists say the proposed plan would dilute, not bolster, their
political clout. They also accuse the city of rushing the issue to
the ballot in hopes of circumventing a court-ordered election plan.
   It was to settle a lawsuit that the city scrapped its
all-at-large council in 1975 for the current one comprised of eight
single-district members and three at-large, including the mayor.
   Blacks _ roughly 30 percent of the city's 985,000 residents _
continually have elected black council members from the city's two,
largely black districts. But Hispanics, who make up more than 18
percent of the city, have elected only one Hispanic from a
single-member district and one at-large member _ neither currently
on the council. The Asian and American Indian population, about 5
percent of the city, has no ethnic representative on the council.
   The ``10-4-1'' proposal on the ballot would add two single
districts and four quadrant representatives, leaving the mayor the
only at-large member.
   Hutchison believes most minorities support the charter change.
   ``It defies me why the media listens to the vocal opposition to
a 10-4-1 plan that gives minorities the greatest opportunity to
achieve racial equality,'' he said.
   The charter review committee grew out of an interracial group,
Dallas Together, appointed by Mayor Annette Strauss last year to
help ease racial tensions.
   Friction was growing over confrontations between minorities and
police. Dallas officers had their deadliest year on record with
five officers slain, and several blacks and Hispanics _ some merely
bystanders to crime _ were shot by police. A congressional inquiry
found no misuse of deadly force, but recommended police hire more
minorities and study alternatives to force. The inquiry did little
to calm minority fears.
   Since then, protesters have marched the streets, dumped tea in
the City Hall pond, come chained and gagged to council meetings,
locked arms and sung, ``We Shall Overcome,'' to council members,
and chased the mayor from the chambers.
   ``I've never seen our community more unified on any subject
before,'' said Pete Johnson, executive director of the Dallas
chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Council, a civil
rights group. ``Not any black organization _ not even the Black
Chamber of Commerce _ has come out in support of this plan.''
   Johnson, who is black, doesn't believe minorities would gain any
representation under the 10-4-1 plan. And adding council seats that
minorities might not win could dilute instead of strengthen their
political power, he said.
   With two seats out of 10 _ excluding the mayor _ blacks now make
up a fifth of the council. They'd lose voting strength if they had
only two sure seats out of 14 under the 10-4-1 plan, he said.
``Percentage wise ... it's crazy. I've always thought it's because
they think we can't add.''
   Some Hispanics believe they stand to gain under the proposed
charter change.
   ``Right now we don't have a Chicano on the council. I think this
plan will give us the chance to have probably two,'' said Rene
Martinez, a minority business activist who leads the pro-change
Vote Yes for Dallas campaign.
   The 10-4-1 plan is backed by the Dallas Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce.
   But other Hispanics side with the black opponents.
   Diana Orozco, co-chair of Dallas Citizens for Democracy, said
she believes city leaders thought the ballot issue would help them
answer a federal lawsuit challenging the city's voting system.
   The lawsuit, filed last year by two black activists, is
scheduled to be heard in September. Ms. Orozco's group believes the
city needs at least 12 single-member districts to give minorities
fair representation.
   ``I think that they (city leaders) felt that by placing the
10-4-1 Plan on the ballot that the federal judge would delay the
matter, but that did not happen,'' Ms. Orozco said. ``I think we're
just dividing the city on this issue and wasting money when it is
in the federal courts.''

<HEAD>ABA Opposes Any Amendment to Ban Flag-Burning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association's policy-making
body has voted to oppose the adoption of a constitutional amendment
against desecrating the flag.
   The resolution, adopted in a voice vote Wednesday by the
459-member House of Delegates at the ABA's annual meeting, said the
ABA was acting ``in the interest of preserving intact the right to
freedom of speech and expression.''
   The ABA also said it opposes any federal legislation making it a
crime to desecrate the American flag as a political protest.
   At the same time, the ABA declared the flag a ``revered national
symbol that ought to be treated with great respect by all citizens
of the United States of America.''
   The resolution is in response to calls by many, including
President Bush, for a constitutional amendment against defiling the
flag.
   That call came after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Texas
case in June that flag-burning is protected under the First
Amendment guarantee of free speech.
   A report by an ABA task force supporting the resolution quoted
the 18th century French philosopher Voltaire: ``I disapprove of
what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.''

<TEXT>
   For the first time in West Point's
187-year history, the captain of the Corps of Cadets is a woman.
   Kristin Baker, a self-proclaimed ``Army brat'' from Burke, Va.,
confidently marched onto the U.S. Military Academy grounds
Wednesday afternoon after leading a regiment of new cadets on a
13-mile march from Lake Frederick, where they'd trained for six
days.
   The 5-foot-4, 112-pound Baker, who received the academy's
highest cadet honor on the basis of academic excellence, athletic
ability and military prowess, told the panting plebes to get some
chow and then waded into a horde of reporters and photographers.
   ``Now, my first objective is `Ring Weekend,' then the first
football game, then graduation on the 31st of May. Beyond that, I
really don't know,'' she said.
   Commanding a brigade of more than 4,400 cadets will be Baker's
primary concern for the coming academic year, which starts today.
   Women, admitted as cadets since 1976, make up 10 percent of the
cadets at West Point.
   ``The first captaincy at West Point was one of the last hurdles,
if you will, that women had to cross before they were fully
accepted as members of the officer corps of the Army,'' said Col.
James Hawthorne, director of academy relations.
   One of Baker's fellow cadets said her appointment might open
more doors in the Army for women.
   ``If she does well, then I think they'll be more likely to chose
a female for higher positions,'' said junior Lisa Buskirk.
   Baker, 21, is majoring in human factors psychology _ the study
of the interaction between man and machines. She said she has not
decided what she wants to do once commissioned as a second
lieutenant in the U.S. Army.
   ``This is just a small part of what I'm going to do in the
future,'' Baker said. ``As far as what I'm going to do, whether or
not I'm going to make it a career, is still to be seen.''
   The daughter of an Army colonel who's also a U.S. Military
Academy graduate, Baker said she never felt pressured by her father
to follow in his footsteps.
   ``He supported me no matter where I went,'' Baker said. ``I had
teachers who pushed harder than my father did.''

<TEXT>
   U.S.-Soviet negotiations on chemical weapons will
resume next week, an American diplomat said Thursday.
   A Soviet official said new agreements could be reached in the
10-day round, but the U.S. assessment was more cautious.
   The talks are aimed at setting joint inspections of each side's
chemical arms sites and settling disputes over how to monitor
stockpiles.
   The superpowers say such moves will help speed the Geneva talks
on a global ban of the weapons, where verification long has been a
point of disagreement.
   U.S.-Soviet talks were expected to resume in the fall. Now, the
new round precedes next month's meeting between Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
in the United States.
   In the round, ``the Soviet delegation intends to complete the
development of an agreement on those areas where positions of the
U.S.S.R. and U.S.A are close,'' Moscow's chief envoy Sergei
Batsanov told the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament.
   The conference has been debating a worldwide ban on the
production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons for 21 years.
   U.S. envoy Max Friedersdorf said negotiators will ``make every
effort'' to build the last round's progress and finish draft
agreements in the new session, set for Aug. 15-24.
   But he said ``some big divergences'' remain and refused to
predict whether work could be completed.
   After the last round, both sides reported agreement on
principles governing on-the-spot inspections. They said more work
was needed on other issues, including an exchange of stockpile data
and the timing of inspections.
   Moscow removed a main obstacle last month by accepting the U.S.
position that inspections begin even while a global chemical arms
ban is being drafted.
   Geneva negotiators will seek to work out a detailed accord on
this point, Friedersdorf said in an interview.
   He said the Soviet shift was ``an important step ... but as far
as getting a worldwide ban, it doesn't move the process forward as
much as we would like.''
   ``In the overall picture, we've still got a long way to go,'' he
said.
   Batsanov said early inspections ``would be a very serious
confidence-building measure'' and foster ``openness and
transparency in the military field.''
   The United States and Soviet Union have the world's biggest
chemical arsenals.
   Through inspections of Soviet sites, U.S. officials say they
want to verify Moscow's claims it has no more than 50,000 tons of
chemical armaments. Some Western analysts have said the actual
stockpile is more than six times bigger.
   Neither side has given firm indications when data exchanges or
inspections could begin.

   An American Airlines airliner carrying 211
people from Phoenix to Chicago landed at Albuquerque International
Airport today after developing a hydraulic leak, officials said.
   The Boeing 767 landed about 9:40 a.m. with no loss of steering,
authorities said.
   ``The captain got an indicator that there was a loss of
hydraulic fluid, so he decided to land the plane in Albuquerque as
a precaution,'' said Ed Stewart, a spokesman for American Airlines
in Dallas.
   Ground crews found a valve near the wheel well had cracked and
caused a leak in one of the plane's three hydraulic systems, said
Don Ashmore general manager for American Airlines in Albuquerque.
   Hydraulic systems power brakes, flaps and other steering
surfaces.

   A water entertainment park, Wild Water
Adventures, has fired a male employee for wearing a diamond stud in
his left ear.
   Ted Hallisey, 27, said Wednesday he plans to file complaints
with the American Civil Liberties Union and the state Department of
Fair Housing, but an official of the state agency doubted that the
case will be investigated.
   ``In the state of California, an employer can have reasonable
grooming standards,'' said Gus Oliveira, district administrator of
the fair employment agency. ``As long as they are not burdensome
and are enforced equally, they are lawful.''
   Hallisey, a Fresno State University student, contended that it
is unfair to let women employees wear earrings and not men. The
employee handbook at Wild Water Adventures, outside Fresno, allows
women who watch over the water rides or sell refreshments to wear
post earrings, but bans them on male employees.
   ``We don't let men wear dresses here either,'' said park
spokeswoman Kathy Siggers. ``We try to maintain a traditional,
conservative dress code.''

   Rudy Mikeska, a restaurateur who over more
than three decades served barbecue to presidents, governors and
millions of others, has died of cancer. He was 68.
   The Mikeska family was cited by Texas Monthly magazine in 1986
as ``The First Family of Texas Barbecue.''
   Mikeska, who died Wednesday at his home in this town near
Austin, served Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, former
Govs. Preston Smith and Dolph Briscoe, and catered both of
incumbent Gov. Bill Clements' inaugural dinners.
   He once catered a meal for 18,000 people at the South Texas
Nuclear Project, a nuclear power plant, according to Mikeska's son,
Tim Mikeska.
   The younger Mikeska estimated that 5 million people have been
served by the restaurant in Taylor in the last 16 years.
   Mikeska's has four custom-made barbecue pits that can cook 66
10-pound briskets at once. The restaurant can prepare food for more
than 2,000 people per hour, Tim Mikeska said.
   Survivors include his wife and two daughters and one son.
   A funeral Mass is scheduled Sunday in Taylor.

<HEAD>Soviet Concern Over Austria's EEC Membership Application</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Thursday said Austria
could lose its political neutrality as a result of its application
for membership in the European Economic Community.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky noted, however, that Austria's desire
to join the EEC was purely an internal affair.
   Foreign Minister Alois Mock sent a letter to the EEC in July to
apply for membership, insisting on ``safeguarding its
internationally recognized status of permanent neutrality'' to
maintain peace and security in Europe.
   In a memo delivered to Vranitzky on Thursday by Moscow's
ambassador to Vienna, Gennady Shikin, the Kremlin said Austrian
membership in the EEC would not be exclusively economic.
   It could thus lead to ``the loss of the actual possibility (for
Austria) to realize its neutral policy,'' according to the note,
whose text was provided by the Austria Press Agency.
   ``Following from this, (the Soviet leadership) has received with
concern the news of Austria's intent to take up negotiations on
joining the European Community,'' the memo said.
   The memorandum also noted, however, the statements by Austrian
leaders that it will consider membership only if its neutrality is
not jeapordized.
   It said the Soviet Union hoped neutrality would remain a
priority, noting that Austria's neutrality ``represents ... a great
factor of stability, of trust and of mutual understanding in all of
Europe.''
   Vranitzky said the memo showed that Austria was ``on the right
EEC course'' of pushing its own interests while being aware of
``the position of our friends.''
   Austria's parliament voted the country's neutrality into law in
1955 after the conclusion of the state treaty and the withdrawal of
the occupying forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, France
and Britain.
   Under the terms of its neutrality, Austria pledged not to join
any military alliance or allow the stationing of any foreign troops
on its territory.
   With the exception of Ireland, which claims neutrality, all of
the other 12 EEC member countries are also members of the NATO
alliance.

<HEAD>Report: At Least Three Years In Jail Recommended for Swindall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal probation officer has recommended that
former Rep. Pat Swindall serve at least three years in prison for
his conviction on nine counts of lying to a federal grand jury, a
newspaper reports.
   The Fulton County Daily Report said the officer, Riley Erwin,
determined under federal sentencing guidelines that the minimum
sentence would fall into the 37- to 46-month range. The guidelines
do not allow for parole or a suspended sentence.
   The newspaper, which reports largely for the county's legal and
legislative community, said U.S. Attorney Robert Barr, initially
unaware of the confidentiality of Erwin's preliminary report,
confirmed its contents.
   But Barr said Thursday: ``I am aware of the report but I can
neither confirm or deny its contents.''
   He said, however, that the sentencing formula is ``no big
secret'' and anybody could sit down with the guidelines, which are
public, and the convictions and arrive at the same conclusion.
   Swindall, a Georgia Republican, was found guilty of nine perjury
charges related to testimony involving his attempt to negotiate an
$850,000 home loan from an undercover agent posing as a money
launderer.
   Swindall, who lost his 4th District seat to former actor Ben
Jones last November while under indictment on the charges, was
convicted June 21. Sentencing is set for Aug. 28.
   Barr said his office has not made a sentencing recommendation
but expects to do so soon.

   Rescue workers today searched the
muddy banks of the San Rafael River for more victims of a train
crash that killed at least 99 people and scattered rail cars across
the track and into the ravine below.
   The train plunged off a bridge and fell about 25 feet into the
river early Wednesday while en route from the coastal resort of
Mazatlan to the northern city of Mexicali, on the border with
Calexico, Calif.
   Passenger cars were jumbled along the tracks like straws. Some
lay on their side in the river.
   Heavy rains Wednesday hampered efforts to reach victims, and the
search was suspended dring the night, but the sky cleared this
morning and police, firefighters and Red Cross workers returned to
the site.
   Helicopters landed rescue workers nearby and casualties were
taken out on railroad handcars.
   Officials said at least 107 people were injured, including 30
seriously, and that the death toll was expected to rise.
   Torrential rains over the last week were blamed for the crash.
   ``The cause was quite clear. The heavy rains loosened the
railbed and the rails just gave way,'' said Roberto Martinez
Maestre, a spokesman for the state government based in Mexico City,
730 miles from the crash site.
   About 360 people were riding the 11-car train, popularly known
as ``The Burro'' because it stops at almost every station along the
900-mile route.
   Rail and rescue officials could provide no immediate breakdown
on the nationalities of victims. A spokesman at the U.S. Consulate
in Mazatlan said no Americans had so far been reported among the
dead. Eleven victims identified Wednesday night were all Mexicans.
   Three Americans were among the survivors. The two men and a
woman walked away from the wreck without serious injuries and were
put on a bus to Mexicali today, said Francisco Mejia, a state
transportation official in Los Mochis. Mejia did not have the
identities of the Americans but said they were on their way to San
Diego.
   The train was patronized almost entirely by poor Mexicans.
   It left Mazatlan at 7:40 p.m. Tuesday and had gone about 250
miles when the accident occurred at about 4 a.m. Police said they
did not know how fast the train was going at the time of the
accident.
   Most people on the train were apparently asleep, and the
majority of the victims drowned, said Javier Lopez, the Red Cross
duty officer in Los Mochis, 60 miles northeast of the crash scene.
   In Mexico City, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari expressed
his condolences to relatives and said in a statement he had ordered
National Railways _ which includes the Pacfic route _ to pay
compensation and burial costs.
   Survivors were being put up in local hotels and would be given
money for travel and new clothes, according to Luis Humberto
Peimbert, director of social services in the nearby town of Guasave.
   Sinaloa state Gov. Francisco Labastida Ochoa rushed to the scene
Wednesday, then went to nearby Guamuchil for the night. The bodies
and the injured were being brought to Guamuchil and Guasave.
   Lt. Gabriela Herrera, a duty officer with the Guasave police,
said about 20 bodies were in the town's three funeral parlors and
the rest at Guamuchil and Los Mochis, 60 miles away.
   Janet Gaxiole Sandoval, a secretary at a social security clinic
in Guasave, said at least 30 of the injured were in serious
condition.
   Accidents happen every couple of months on the rundown Mexican
railway system, but this was by far the most serious train accident
this year in Mexico.
   At least 34 passengers were killed injured when an express train
derailed in July 1982 near Tepic, capital of Nayarit state south of
Sinaloa.
   Another 62 passengers died and 99 were injured in Feburary 1983
when a train stalled because of a malfunctioning air-brake near the
Sinaloa city of Guaymas and a speeding freight convoy rammed it
from behind.
   Twenty more died and 30 were injured when a bus and a train
collided at a grade crossing in January 1988, also in Nayarit.
   On May 4, a passenger train derailed about 400 miles northwest
of Mexico City, killing at least eight people and injuring 50.
   On Feb. 25, 22 people died when a bus and train collided near
Saltillo, and another 13 people died in a Jan. 31 bus-train
accident in Ciudad Sahagun.

<HEAD>Extremists Demand Entry to Temple Mount As Jews Mourn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM RON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 40 ultra-nationalist Jews demanded entry
to the Temple Mount on Thursday as thousands of other Israelis
recited lamentations on a holy day marking the tragedies that
befell the Jewish people.
   The day of mourning is known as Tisha Be-Av, or the ninth of the
Jewish lunar month of Av, the greatest day of mourning in the
Jewish calendar. Jews traditionally pray on the day at the Western
Wall of the Mount, the last remant of the ancient Jewish temple.
   Members of the extremist Temple Mount Faithful and the
ultra-nationalist Tehiya party demonstrated at the foot of the
Temple Mount, demanding they be allowed to pray on the hilltop,
which contains two Moslem mosques.
   ``Arabs are allowed into the site in their thousands, but Jews
are humiliated and made to go up five by five,'' one demonstrator
shouted.
   Police armed with riot-control gear blocked the demonstrators
from entering the mount except in groups of five, escorted by
officers, to avoid clashes between Jews and Moslems.
   ``We are in total control of the situation,'' said police
spokesman Avi Zelba.
   The Temple Mount is a site of religious significance to both
Jews and Moslems. The Western Wall at the base is the last remnant
of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
   The mount is known as Haram Al-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, to
Moslems. It is administered by Moslem religious authorities and
houses the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, revered as the
site of Mohammed's ascent to heaven.
   The Jewish extremists built a monument to ``Jewish victims of
Arab terror'' at the entrance to the mount after police refused to
allow them to erect it in the walled compound.
   The mount has been the site of clashes between Moslem extremists
and police in the course of the 20-month Palestinian uprising

   Nearby, crowds of Jewish worshipers sat next to the sacred
Western Wall praying and reciting lamentations as they passed 24
hours of fasting. Sitting on the ground is a custom meant to
display sorrow.
   Tisha Be-Av commemorates the destruction of the first temple in
Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586 B.C., as well as the
destruction on the second temple.
   Tisha Be-Av last 24 hours. Entertainment sites are closed by

   A baseball coach described as obsessed
with his 16-year-old star pitcher shot her in front of several
motorists after she leaped from his moving pickup, then killed
himself, authorities said.
   The teen-ager, Suzanne Jacobs of North Highlands, was listed in
critical but stable condition today at the University Medical
Center in Sacramento.
   Sheriff's department spokeswoman Patti Davis said Jesse Aguilar,
42, of North Highlands shot the girl about 5 p.m. Tuesday on an
interstate highway as horrified witnesses who had stopped to help
the girl looked on.
   Motorists said they saw the girl open the passenger door and
jump out.
   A sheriff's deputy who stopped to help was giving the girl first
aid when the coach made his way through the onlookers and pulled a
large-caliber handgun, shot the girl behind the ear, then shot
himself in the head, authorities said.
   The motive for the attack was not immediately known. It was not
known where the coach and teen-ager were headed, sheriff's deputies
said.
   In 1985, Jacobs and Aguilar were featured on Sacramento
television because she was the only girl on her team and also the
star of the youth league.
   Her father, Roger Jacobs, said Aguilar was obsessed with her,
but he said there was no indication of a sexual relationship. He
said Aguilar had followed his daughter around and had tried to
obtain the address of a girl with whom his daughter had recently
become friends.
   Sheriff's Detective Bill Summers said, ``We know that they were
quite close, that they occasionally had their spats and mostly they
were about baseball. If there were other things in there, I really
don't know about it.''
   Jacobs said Aguilar had been his daughter's coach for six years.
He said she had had no social life except for the team, her coach
and his family, until this summer when she had gotten a job and
become friends with the other girl.

   The University of South Carolina got only
27 takers when it asked 2,800 incoming freshmen if they'd like to
live in a dormitory where overnight visits by the opposite sex are
banned.
   But university officials are moving ahead with a policy that
restricts opposite-sex visitation in all on-campus housing by 1992.
   When classes start Aug. 28, two dorms set aside for the ban this
year will be filled by the 27 freshmen who requested spaces plus
453 who did not, either because they oppose it or are unaware of
the policy adopted four months ago by USC's trustees.
   ``We had to make a tough decision and place people in those
buildings even though they hadn't requested it,'' said Richard
Wertz, USC vice president for business affairs.
   USC provides housing for about 6,500 single students.
   Eight women and 19 men said they wanted to live in a hall
banning overnight visits by the opposite sex.
   The school adopted the rules after state Rep. Mike Fair, a USC
trustee, raised concerns over coed dorms, student privacy and
campus safety. Fair said one reason he objected to overnight
visitation was that his daughter, Meredith, planned to enroll.
   The new policy sparked a few student protests. In addition, Miss
Fair decided not to enroll after threats were made against her,
apparently because of her father's role in getting the dorm policy
changed.

<HEAD>Sinhalese Radicals Attack Police Station, Kill 2</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sinhalese radicals stormed a police
station in a seaside resort Thursday, killed two policemen and
escaped with 17 automatic guns, military officials said.
   Elsewhere, 16 more people were killed in Tamil and Sinhalese
ethnic violence since Wednesday, said the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said 25 radicals from the People's Liberation Front took
part in the dawn attack on the police station in Bentota, a popular
resort 45 miles south of Colombo.
   The militants arrived in two vans, threw grenades, opened fire
on guards and fled with the weapons, the officials said.
   On Wednesday, members of the front shot and killed a Sinhalese
soldier's mother and three sisters in the southern Kalutara
district, the officials said. Also in Kalutara, three civilians
were killed by the radicals, they said.
   In the north-central town of Polonnaruwa, soldiers shot to death
a radical fleeing a search operation, the officials said. Three
civilians were killed in the last 24 hours in that town, they said.
   The government blames the left-wing radicals for 4,000 killings
since they launched an anti-government campaign two years ago to
protest the Indian peacekeeping soldiers in the northeast. Indian
soldiers were deployed under an Indian-Sri Lankan peace accord to
disarm Tamil militants who had agreed to end an insurgency for an
independent nation.
   While all rebel groups surrendered arms, the dominant Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam reneged on the pact, signed on July 29, 1987,
and began attacking Indian soldiers. At least 1,000 Indian soldiers
have died in ongoing fighting. About 10,000 Sri Lankans have died
in the six-year separatist war.
   Indian soldiers shot and killed five Tamil Tigers on Wednesday
in Jaffna in the north and Batticaloa in the east, the military
officials said.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa had asked India to withdraw its
soldiers by July 29 to appease the Sinhalese militants and the
Tamil Tigers who had started negotiating with the government.
   The deadline was rejected by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi,
sparking a diplomatic dispute between the countries. Gandhi said he
will order the troops home only when security for the Tamils in the
northeast is assured.
   A showdown was averted when Premadasa sent his Foreign Minister
Ranjan Wijeratne on July 29 for talks in New Delhi on the
withdrawal of the estimated 45,000 soldiers.
   Since the talks began, India withdrew 2,220 soldiers and said it
will pull out the rest in phases by February. Premadasa, however,
said they should leave by the middle of September.
   Wijeratne said that during the New Delhi talks, both sides
agreed a peace committee should oversee security for all
communities in the north and east. The proposed committee would
include representatives of all former Tamil rebel groups and would
be headed by a government minister, he said.
   The other terms for a withdrawal that were worked out during the
New Delhi talks were being studied by the government and the
opposition parties, he said.
   ``If the government accepts the package ... then the cease-fire
(between Indian soldiers and Tamil Tigers) and the induction of the
Tamil Tigers into the peace committee can be worked out,'' he said.
   Tamils, who form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
demand a separate nation, citing discrimination by the majority
Sinhalese in jobs and education. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of
the population and control the government and the military.
   India became involved in the ethnic problems of its southeastern
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for
the rebel cause.

   Prosecutors said Thursday that an Aug. 23
court session regarding the Iran-Contra criminal case against a
former CIA station chief should be open to the public.
   In court papers, the office of independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh said the legal arguments before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals may determine whether Joseph Fernandez will be put on
trial. Also at stake is the ability of Walsh's office to conduct
its work free from interference by the Justice Department, the
prosecutors' papers said.
   The Justice Department, over the objections of the independent
counsel, is taking legal questions concerning classified
information in the Fernandez case to the appeals court in Richmond,
Va.
   The independent counsel is objecting to the appeal, saying the
Justice Department's action in effect would wrest control of the
case from Walsh's office.
   The appeals court has scheduled a closed hearing.
   Fernandez, the spy agency's former station chief in Costa Rica,
is the highest ranking CIA officer ever indicted, associate
independent counsel Laurence Shtasel said in a nine-page brief.
   ``The First Amendment interest in judicial openness is
particularly apparent in the circumstances of this unusual
appeal,'' said the papers filed with the appeals court.
   ``Parts of the government are pitted against each other over the
ultimate issue of who will control this prosecution,'' the
prosecutors noted.
   Also involved in the legal battle, said the prosecution, is the
independent counsel's ability to prosecute government officials,
including those in the CIA, ``in a manner unrestrained by the
Department of Justice.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria, Va.,
decided last month that Fernandez is entitled to disclose as part
of his defense the locations of CIA stations in El Salvador and
Honduras and a third CIA facility in a Latin American country.
   The judge also said Fernandez may disclose details of secret CIA
programs in Costa Rica which prosecutors said were initiated at the
request of that country's government.
   The projects are a sophisticated communications station,
assistance to Costa Rica's defense forces and a program dealing
with Nicaraguan nationals in Costa Rica to enhance that country's
preparation for possible aggressive action by Nicaragua.
   The Justice Department, acting on behalf of the CIA, objected to
making detailed disclosure about the stations and programs and
announced it would appeal Hilton's rulings.
   Walsh's office says the department's only course of action is to
file an affidavit prohibiting disclosure of the information on
national security grounds. That could lead to dismissal of some or
all of the criminal charges against Fernandez.
   Walsh's office could then file its own appeal with the appeals
court.
   The Justice Department is reluctant to take the drastic step of
filing a potentially case-killing affidavit.

   The State Department said Thursday a Palestine
Liberation Organization statement raises questions about the
group's ``commitment to accommodation, understanding and peace.''
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler commented in response to a
question about the statement by the Fatah, the main group of the
PLO, at a meeting in Tunisia.
   Delegates to the fifth congress of the Fatah approved a
resolution calling for ``intensification of the armed struggle and
all other forms of battle to put an end to the Israeli occupation
of Palestinian territories.''
   The Fatah resolution, distributed by the Palestinian news agency
WAFA, did not say what kind of military operations might be
conducted outside the occupied lands or define ``all other forms of
battle.''
   Hard-liners had pressed the congress to recommend extending the
armed struggle beyond the West Bank and Gaza. PLO leader Yasser
Arafat's declaration that military action would be confined to the
occupied territories had helped persuade the Bush administration to
open a dialogue with the PLO.
   At the State Department, Ms. Tutwiler said: ``The political
program ... raises questions about Fatah's commitment to
accommodation, understanding and peace. This statement's derogatory
rhetoric on Israel, its tone of confrontation and violence and its
preference for unrealistic principles and solutions instead of
practical ideas for peace are unhelpful.''
   Under Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's election plan for
the area, Palestinian delegates would be chosen to negotiate with
Israel.
   Fatah said elections must be held in ``a democratic atmosphere
under international supervision after the withdrawal of Israeli
forces ... as part of a global plan for a definitive solution to
the Israeli-Arab conflict.''

<HEAD>Party Expels Computer Entrepreneur For Supporting Protests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The ruling Communist Party expelled China's
leading computer entrepreneur from its ranks Thursday for having
supported the spring pro-democracy protests.
   Police, meanwhile, said they had arrested another student leader.
   Leading party theorists gathered to praise senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's contributions to party theory in yet another sign of the
growing official reverence being given the 84-year-old leader since
he ordered the June crackdown on the student-led protests.
   Officials also reported the executions of 18 convicted thieves
or robbers, but said the crimes were not connected with the
protests.
   Xinhua said Wan Runnan, whose computer company, the Stone Group
Co., was nicknamed the IBM of China, was expelled from the party
and fired as Stone chairman and president. He fled China after the
crackdown.
   Wan, 43, founded Stone in 1984 and built it into China's leading
computer manufacturer and a model of Western-style management
techniques. He epitomized the pre-crackdown reform dream of private
entrepreneurs turning ideas and know-how into cash.
   Xinhua said Wan ``plotted, fanned and directly joined in the
recent ... counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' After the government
imposed martial law in Beijing on May 20 to quell the protests,
Stone's research institute collected signatures from members of the
national legislature, calling for an emergency session to discuss
ending martial law.
   Wan was the most prominent businessman involved in the democracy
movement, but many small private tradesmen supported it quietly by
donating food, drinks and other supplies to the student protesters.
   Two other dissidents, academics Yan Jiaqi and Bao Zunxin, were
expelled from the party Wednesday and dismissed from their research
posts. Yan also has fled China, where there is a warrant for his
arrest; Bao is believed to be in jail.
   Police in the southeastern city of Guangzhou confirmed they had
arrested Zheng Xuguang of the Beijing Space and Aeronautics
University, bringing to seven the number of student leaders
confirmed in custody from a national most-wanted list of 21.
   The police, contacted by telephone, said they arrested Zheng,
20, last month but could not give other details. Hong Kong's Wen
Wei Po newspaper, which often has reliable reports on mainland
affairs, said Zheng was traced by following a Hong Kong traveler
who was found to be carrying a foreign passport with Zheng's
picture. Zheng apparently hoped to use the fake passport to escape.
   Guangzhou is about 60 miles west of Hong Kong, and is a major
transit point for people going to and from the British enclave. Two
students on the most-wanted list, Wu'er Kaixi and Li Lu, who
escaped to the West did so through Hong Kong, as did several older
dissidents.
   Police have refused to comment on reports that the No. 1 student
on the wanted circular, Wang Dan of Beijing University, was
arrested.
   There have been no reports that any of the arrested students
have been tried.
   Eighteen people were executed Wednesday in Guangzhou, according
to the city Intermediate People's Court, but their crimes of theft
or robbery were not related to the protests.
   About 50 non-political executions have been reported in the past
two months. Executions in China are carried out with a bullet to
the back of the head.
   Xinhua, meanwhile, said top party researchers and regional party
officials took part in a four-day seminar on Deng's
``party-building theory'' in the northeastern city of Harbin. The
report said they concluded it was ``of great significance'' to
study Deng's theory, which the theorists said had enriched and
developed the theory of revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung. Xinhua
did not explain Deng's theory.
   Mao long has been heralded as China's chief contributor to
Marxist theory. The new attention to Deng's role as a theorist
comes as the entire nation is being required to study his June 9
speech in which he praised the army for crushing the student
protests.
   Although Deng was recognized as the final arbiter of party
policy, before the crackdown he had maintained a relatively low
profile, appearing in public infrequently and rarely being quoted
in the media. Since the crackdown, however, newspapers are full of
admonitions to study his works, and a major movie about his early
revolutionary career has been released.

   Models in swimwear, athletes in
underwear, sunny beaches, snow-capped mountains _ the kind of
pictures that usually wind up in magazine advertisements are
predictable. So how did the Georgia House of Representatives make
the cut?
   A three-quarter page color picture of the state House appears in
an ad the Insurance Information Institute ran in Time, Newsweek,
U.S. News and World Report, Fortune and Forbes magazines last month.
   It reads, ``To stop auto insurance rates from going up, we're
going House to House.''
   ``I'd rather not see my ugly features in any picture, but I
can't stop them from doing it,'' said House Speaker Tom Murphy,
explaining that anyone can take pictures in the House.
   A spokesman for the Boston ad agency that handled the ad said
the picture of Georgia legislators was a ``stock picture'' chosen
for no specific reason.
   Charles Clark, an executive vice president for the institute,
declined to say whether the Georgians were the most attractive of
the state legislators.
   ``That I don't know,'' he said, laughing. ``We just picked the
most attractive photo we could find.''

   They'll never draw the thousands of
tourists who flock to see the swallows return to Mission San Juan
Capistrano, but the geese have returned to Capitol Beach.
   In late June, about 100 geese were rounded up and shipped off by
the state Game and Parks Commission. Game and Parks worker Frank
Andelt predicted at that time ``they'll be back. I'm not so sure
that it'll be the same geese, but geese will be back.''
   State workers inspected last week and found a new gaggle,
without the identification bands used to tag the ones shipped 160
miles southwest because they were bombarding Capitol Beach yards
and water with unhealthy fallout.
   Capitol Beach residents are worried they'll have the same
problems again, but have mixed feelings.
   ``Everybody seems to be quite happy that we have geese back
here,'' said Marjorie Reid, secretary of the Capitol Beach
Community Association. ``We'll just have to wait until next spring
to see how many stay around.''
   Joe Gabig, waterfowl biologist at Game and Parks, said, ``I'm
almost sure some geese will stay,'' because it is a suitable
habitat. He said relocating the new birds would be very difficult
this time of year. Geese can only be collected easily when adults
are molting and goslings are too young to fly.

   An 11-year-old boy who earned spending money by
delivering crack cocaine was arrested after handing some it to an
undercover police officer, authorities said.
   Officer Fabian Arista said he arranged to buy $40 worth of crack
_ two rock-like crystals _ from a woman Wednesday, but she told him
she would have to phone her ``regular connection.''
   Arista said he asked the woman who was bringing him the crack.
She said, ``The youngster's carrying it for him,'' Arista said.
   The boy walked out of a nearby apartment complex 10 minutes
later, gave the officer four-tenths of a gram of crack and took his
money, Arista said.
   The officer said he asked the boy: ``What are you doing? You
just making some extra money this summer?
   ``He just shook his head and smiled. He knew full well what he
was doing.''
   After Arista left, a police team moved in to make arrests.
   Pamela Denise Culbreath, 33, who allegedly arranged the deal,
was charged with delivery of a controlled substance. The boy's
19-year-old brother was charged with carrying a prohibited weapon,
a .22-caliber pistol, Arista said.
   The boy was turned over to juvenile authorities, who charged him
with delivery of a controlled substance, Arista said.
   Police Sgt. A.D. Moore said the boy was released to his mother.

   Officials today unveiled a
50-foot winged rocket of the sort that will be launched from a B-52
bomber in October in the first flight of a privately developed
booster designed to put satellites in orbit at low cost.
   The gleaming white Pegasus rocket, similar to the pioneering
X-15 rocket plane, was rolled out of a hangar at NASA's Ames-Dryden
Flight Research Facility as 400 people watched and a high school
band played.
   Antonio Elias, a scientist who originated the idea for Orbital
Sciences Corp., noted its adaptation of technology from Air Force
and Navy missiles and declared Pegasus ``a noteworthy example of
swords turned into plowshares.''
   Orbital Sciences Corp. developed the rocket with Hercules
Aerospace Co. Orbital Sciences spokeswoman Barbara C. Zadina said
that at a cost of $6 million to $8 million per launch, ``we are
lowering the threshold for getting into space.''
   While the Pentagon and NASA are interested in using Pegasus
rockets for military and scientific projects, ``you're going to see
states, small countries or university programs that want to get
into space,'' Zadina said Wednesday. ``Now, for $6 million, they
can afford a dedicated launch.''
   Before the Challenger disaster in 1986, NASA was charging about
$35 million to deploy a large satellite. Last year, NASA
recommended a $110 million fee for a shuttle payload.
   Pegasus will allow small satellites to be launched at low cost
for astronomy, environmental and other research, said Robert Pincus
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   An Orbital Sciences brochure calls Pegasus a ``winged
workhorse'' _ apparently after the winged horse of mythology.
   The Pegasus rocket unveiled today will not be the one launched
in October. Instead, it will be carried aloft under the wings of a
NASA B-52 for test flights later this month and in early October.
   Later in October, another Pegasus will be released from a B-52
about 40,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean off the California coast.
The three-stage rocket will ignite and carry into orbit a
three-part payload named PEGSAT that contains NASA and Pentagon
experiments.
   The first flight also may carry ``a small satellite that will be
used by the state of Virginia for environmental monitoring of
Chesapeake Bay,'' Zadina said.
   Orbital Sciences says the 41,000-pound Pegasus is 49.2 feet
long, 50 inches in diameter and has a delta-shaped wing with a
22-foot span.
   It can carry into low Earth orbit payloads up to 6 feet long,
almost four feet in diameter, and weighing up to 900 pounds,
according to Orbital Sciences Corp.
   Zadina said the date of the October Pegasus launch remains to be
scheduled, and a second flight is due late this year or early in
1990.
   On the first flight, Pegasus will launch PEGSAT. The first part
of the triple payload is a small, experimental Navy communications
relay satellite that will separate from PEGSAT once it is in orbit,
said Pincus, NASA's PEGSAT project manager.
   The Navy wants to learn if such satellites can help it relay
data collected by its weather and oceanographic research
instruments, according to a statement issued in May by the
Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   PEGSAT also will carry sensors to collect information on
Pegasus' surroundings as it is launched. That will help the effort
to build lighter, less expensive satellites, Pincus said.
   Sixty to 90 days after PEGSAT reaches orbit, it will release its
third payload _ a series of canisters that will release the
chemical barium into space to help NASA scientists study Earth's
magnetic field and the electrically charged particles trapped
inside it, he added.
   Orbital Sciences and Hercules announced in June that their first
commercial customer is Ball Corp. Under an agreement, Pegasus
rockets will be used to launch two Ball communications satellites
in 1990 or 1991.

<TEXT>
   Bees are a public-relations nightmare, but
the busy little buzzers are vital to the nation's food supply and
have gotten a bum rap just because they sting, say conventioneering
beekeepers.
   Larry Connor, a consulting entomologist who conducted a public
relations workshop, described the public's attitude as ``the only
good bug is a dead bug.''
   That feeling isn't shared by the 150 people at the four-day
annual meeting of the Western Apicultural Society, a gathering of
backyard beekeepers, academics and a smattering of commercial
apiculturalists _ a fancy word for beekeepers.
   They speak in hushed tones about their favorite insect and its
social structure, a highly evolved system that one said ``makes us
look like very hostile creatures _ talk about perfect social
control!''
   ``You have to be kind of fascinated and drawn to it. It's just
like a microcosm,'' said Mark Jensen of Los Altos Hills, who
started keeping bees 20 years ago when a friend had to get rid of a
4-H project. Now he keeps about 100 hives at several locations,
including 18 in his backyard.
   ``It's like a whole society,'' he added. ``It's like you've got
a window on a little nation, almost.''
   A typical hive consists of 20,000 to 50,000 bees. Female workers
make up the core of the colony and are overseen by one queen, who
controls her own fertility. Male honeybees, called drones, do not
work _ or sting _ and are available for mating.
   For Nancy Stewart, bee behavior is captivating.
   ``The women do all the work, but when winter comes along, they
kick the males out,'' she said. ``They won't feed them anymore.
They'll die.''
   Once stung by the beekeeping urge, it's hard to shake, said
Helynn Carrier, co-owner of a beekeeping supply shop in San Jose.
   ``They get bee fever and they just can't stand it,'' she said.
``You meet people who've been keeping bees and they'd almost rather
give up their wife than their bees _ or their husband.''
   Bees can help with human problems, according to Joe Stone, who's
been using bee phobia in volunteer work with juvenile delinquents
for 13 years.
   ``If they can overcome their fear of working with bees, they can
overcome other fears,'' said Stone, a retired government employee
who works with the Kern County probation department.
   Stone's face lights up as he describes the pride youths take in
learning to handle honeybees.
   ``They just can't believe they're doing this,'' he said, adding
that two of his charges have gone on to build a beekeeping business
of their own.
   Yet even the bees' honey has a popularity problem in this
country, where per capita consumption barely exceeds a pound per
year. By contrast, West Germans consume three pounds of honey per
person annually, and Canadians average 2.2 pounds.
   That's where Naomi Gunter comes in. As American Honey Queen
1989, Gunter, of Towner, N.D., tours the land promoting honey while
wearing a $10 bee-shaped rhinestone ring. A brochure of her own
honey recipes includes glazed hamballs, ranch beans and crispy
cabbage slaw. There's even a recipe for a honey facial.
   California Honey Queen Kimberly Agnew, of El Monte, Calif.,
showed off honeybees painted on her fingernails and hives on her
thumbnails.

<HEAD>Aspen Dispute Heats Up With Fish Poisoning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man's plan to open his ranch to commercial
trout fishing has angered his rural neighbors and led to complaints
about gunshots, vandalism and the poisoning of two ponds filled
with dozens of large fish.
   The neighbors, including ``gonzo'' journalist Hunter S.
Thompson, oppose the commercial fishing operation because they
object to further development in the Woody Creek community outside
Aspen.
   Floyd Watkins, owner of Beaver Run Ranch, has reported several
incidents in recent days, including obscenities scrawled in his
fresh concrete driveway, shotgun blasts fired near his ranch and
the near-fatal poisoning of his dog.
   In addition, he says someone erected a sign on his property
saying, ``Fat Floyd's Trout Farm _ Public Fishing Welcome,'' and
someone cut down signs on Watkins' property announcing the Beaver
Run Ranch.
   There also have been several verbal confrontations, including
those involving Watkins and Thompson, authorities said.
   Then, the dispute escalated Wednesday from the civil complaint
level to a full criminal investigation with the poisoning of two
fish ponds.
   ``It's gone beyond the shouting, name-calling thing, even the
noise-making side of it, because now we have fish killed and
poisoning of a waterway,'' said Pitkin County Deputy Sheriff
Michael Kendrick. ``(It is) now criminal in nature.''
   The sheriff's investigation includes a variety of other
incidents that have been reported in the Woody Creek area. A focal
point of the investigation is the dispute between Watkins and his
neighbors.
   People downstream along the creek were being warned against
drinking the water, eating fish from it or having livestock use the
water _ until the poison that was used can be identified, Kendrick
said.
   Mac Myers, deputy district attorney, said prosecutors were
reviewing the incidents and allegations to decide whether any
charges would be filed.
   Samples of the dead fish and the water were sent for analysis;
the results were not immediately available. Pitkin County
Environmental Health Department officials said they suspect the
substance used was rotenone, an agent designed specifically to kill
fish by reducing the oxygen content in water.
   Watkins reported 80 percent of the fish in two ponds on his
property killed, and estimated the loss at 3,000 pounds of fish,
worth about $40,000.
   ``Those fish (up to 20-pounds each) are worth 500 bucks apiece.
These are trophy fish,'' he said.
   The substance apparently was put into the creek above Watkins'
property sometime late Tuesday, with the fish kill evident on
Wednesday, Kendrick said.
   ``We don't have any physical evidence _ tire tracks or boot
prints,'' Kendrick said. ``We'll probably find out what the
chemical is (but that won't) necessarily lead us anywhere.''

<HEAD>Customs Says Drug Paraphernalia Law Confusing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Customs Service has confiscated some
$14 million worth of drug paraphernalia in the past 16 months, but
the agency still isn't clear on what items fall into that category,
an official said Thursday.
   The Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act of 1986 isn't
specific enough, John Esau, director of the Customs Service
commercial fraud and enforcement center, told the U.S.
International Trade Commission.
   ``This particular law makes it extraordinarily difficult to
define what is drug paraphernalia,'' Esau testified. ``We are going
to rely on the courts to help us define it.''
   Among the factors the law allows Customs to use to determine
whether an item is drug paraphernalia are instructions provided
with the item concerning its use, advertising, how it is displayed
for sale and the existence and extent of the item's legitimate uses.
   Representatives of the pipe business told the commission that
manufacturers and retailers can't read consumers' minds and can't
be held responsible for illegal use of legitimate items.
   ``I agree its tragic there's a drug problem in this country, but
a lack of imagination is the only limit to turning anything into
drug paraphernalia,'' businessman Richard K. Rowland testified.
   Rowland's Contempo Tobacco Products warehouse in Nashville was
raided in March. Then-Customs Commissioner William von Raab said at
the time that the 306,000 items seized filled eight 48-foot
containers and was the largest such seizure in U.S. history.
   The items being confiscated ``are similar or the same as items
or materials that have been in the tobacco industry for hundreds of
years,'' Rowland said.
   ``What we in the tobacco industry need are some very specific
guidelines as to what is and what is not drug paraphernalia and
why,'' Rowland said. ``Are all glass pipes illegal? Are all wood
pipes illegal? Are all stone pipes illegal or is there one type
that is legal? All I'm saying is give me the rules and let me steer
clear of this legal minefield called the Mail Order Drug
Paraphernalia Control Act.''
   The act calls for penalties of up to 3 years in prison and
$100,000 in fines for each violation.
   ITC Chairwoman Anne E. Brunsdale pressed Rowland and others to
suggest guidelines.
   Lorraine Shapiro of The Mill in Corning, N.Y., a manufacturer
that uses imported woods in pipes and that lost some $45,000 worth
of inventory through a Customs-led raid in January, was the only
one who offered any ideas, suggesting a minimum pipe bowl diameter
of ] of an inch and a minimum stem length of 2 inches.
   Robert Vaughn, a Nashville attorney representing the American
Pipe &amp; Tobacco Council Inc., an information clearinghouse, said he
would have to survey the 700 members of the American Pipe and
Accessory League before offering any suggestions.
   In addition to more specific definitions of drug paraphernalia,
Esau said Customs also wants to change required manifests to help
the service narrow down questionable items.
   For example, he said, all plastic bags being imported are listed
simply as plastic bags, not differentiating between huge garbage
bags and 1{-inch square containers used by drug dealers as well as
by such businesses as jewelers and makers of precision ball
bearings.
   Having a separate manifest listing for such small bags, he said,
would make the recipients of such imports easier to spot.
   Esau told the commission _ which is reviewing the imports at the
request of the Senate Finance Committee _ that most of the
paraphernalia being seized comes from Pacific Basin countries and
``areas of the Middle East.'' In an interview, he identified as
exporters Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan and said the People's
Republic of China and Korea may also be exporters.

   Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell in
Thursday's auction to the lowest level in nearly three years as the
government completed a series of huge debt auctions intended to
raise $44.5 billion this week.
   The average yield was 8.14 percent, down from 9.11 percent at
the last auction on May 11.
   It was the lowest rate since 30-year bonds averaged 7.54 percent
on Nov. 6, 1986. The bonds will carry a coupon interest rate of 8[
percent with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,983.30.
   A total of $9.75 billion in bonds were sold out of bids totaling
$20.1 billion.
   In addition, the Treasury on Thursday auctioned special
short-term debt securities totaling $15 billion which will include
the first $5 billion raised to pay for the savings and loan bailout.
   The 247-day bills, which the government must repay on April 19,
have an average yield of 8.36 percent.
   Thursday's auctions followed the sale of $10.03 billion in
three-year notes with an average yield of 7.93 percent on Tuesday
and $$9.76 billion in 10-year notes with an average yield of 8.03
percent on Wednesday.
   The auctions are part of the regular sales done once every three
months to roll over the government's debt. This week's followed the
vote in Congress last week to raise the national debt limit by $70
billion to $2.87 trillion through Oct. 31. By then, Congress hopes
to complete work on a bill boosting the Treasury's permanent
borrowing authority to more than $3.1 trillion.

   Prominent Palestinians said Thursday that PLO
chief Yasser Arafat may have a more flexible hand in pursuing his
peace proposals after winning a vote of confidence from his Fatah
faction.
   But Israel's Foreign Ministry said decisions of the Fatah
General Congress this week represented a ``step backward'' from
moderation. A liberal Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, deplored the
group's insistence on continued armed struggle.
   The six-day meeting by more than 1,000 Fatah members, which
ended Thursday, overwhelmingly endorsed Arafat's policies, which
this year carried the Palestine Liberation Organization to official
recognition of Israel.
   It was seen by many mainstream Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied territories as a triumph over hard-liners who have
opposed Arafat's turn to diplomacy in the PLO's efforts to win a
Palestinian state.
   ``I think he's been given a free hand,'' said George Jakaman,
professor of philosophy at the West Bank's Bir Zeit University.
   Daoud Kuttab, a prominent Palestinian journalist, said,
``Arafat's maneuverability has been enhanced, both in the political
resolutions and in the persons elected to top positions in Fatah.''
   Radwan Abu Ayyash, a Fatah supporter and head of the Arab
Journalists Association, said in an interview that ``one of the
reasons such a (meeting) was held was to give Arafat more support,
more credibility among his own people in order to move ahead.''
   Kuttab said Arafat's victory over hard-liners ``signals to the
smaller factions and to adversaries ... that when Arafat is
talking, he's talking with the support of the vast majority of
Palestinians.''
   Kuttab said the decisions give Arafat greater power to explore
Israel's proposal for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   The Fatah meeting left open the possibility of elections after
an Israeli troop withdrawal from the territories.
   Israel's government approved a plan in May that calls for
Palestinians in the occupied lands to choose representatives who
will negotiate limited autonomy as an interim solution. Final
disposition of the West Bank and Gaza would be left until later.
   ``If Arafat wanted tommorrow to name a delegation ... to make
initial negotiations with the Israelis, he can do this with more
confidence than he could before,'' Kuttab said.
   That prospect worries Palestinian leftists, who fear Arafat has
given up too much by accepting Israel and by restricting
Palestinian guerrilla activity to military targets and Israeli-held
territory.
   Hard-liners at the Fatah congress won a call for ``the
intensification of the armed struggle ... to put an end to the
Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.''
   That reiteration of Fatah's traditional path of guerrilla
action, launched by Arafat and a handful of colleagues in 1964,
chilled Israeli views of the conference.
   Despite widespread recognition of the PLO as the representive of
the world's 5 million Palestinians, Israel has outlawed any
dealings with the PLO, claiming the organization is a terrorist
entity.
   ``Part of what they call armed struggle, we call terrorism,''
said Israeli Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alon Liel.
   He noted the Fatah statements did not explicitly repeat Arafat's
Dec. 14 declaration renouncing terrorism, recognizing Israel and
accepting a U.N. resolution endorsing a land-for-peace trade with
Israel.
   Israeli officials claims that Fatah has launched 11 attacks and
attempted attacks in Israel since December, casting doubt on its
renunciation of terror.

   Hours before being rushed to the hospital
with chest pains, popular 1950s and '60s television personality Art
Linkletter went ahead and appeared on ``The Pat Sajak Show'' even
though he was already feeling ill, spokesmen said.
   The 77-year-old humorist, whose ``Art Linkletter's House Party''
was television's longest-running daytime variety show, was taken by
ambulance to the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical
Center on Wednesday night. He was held for observation and tests,
said nursing supervisor Susan Davidson.
   ``He is fully alert, talking and laughing,'' Ms. Davidson said.
   Linkletter was stricken soon after appearing on CBS' ``The Pat
Sajak Show,'' and had been feeling ill before he taped the show,
said Sajak spokesman Bob Burton.
   ``Art is the definition of a trouper,'' Sajak said in a
statement. ``He was obviously in some discomfort, but he performed
beautifully.''
   Rich Elbaum, another spokesman at the hospital, said doctors had
not immediately determined if Linkletter had suffered a heart
attack. He was listed in fair condition.
   The entertainer was stricken at his house in the exclusive Bel
Air area about 7 p.m.
   Linkletter was host of several popular radio and TV shows,
including ``Art Linkletter's House Party'' and ``People Are
Funny.'' The ``House Party'' began as a radio show in 1944 and
moved to television in 1952. It stayed on the air until 1969,
setting a longevity record for shows of its type.
   His books ``Kids Say The Darndest Things'' _ based on interviews
with youngsters down on his ``House Party'' _ and ``Old Age Is Not
For Sissies'' were best-sellers.

   Former Miss America Bess Myerson and her
boyfriend, Carl Capasso, who recently finished a two-year prison
term for tax evasion, aren't living together but are still a
twosome, Capasso says.
   ``I'm a single parent in an apartment with kids in it and she
has her own apartment. We live separately but we're together,''
Capasso told the New York Post in an interview published Thursday.
   Asked about marriage, Capasso grinned and said, ``Listen, that's
the one thing that could break up any relationship.''
   The couple were acquitted Dec. 22 on charges they tried to have
Capasso's divorce payments to his former wife, Nancy, reduced by
giving a job to the divorce judge's daughter in Myerson's office.
   Myerson was the city's commissioner for cultural affairs.
   In Thursday's editions, Post columnist Cindy Adams reported that
while Capasso, a sewer contractor, was in prison, Myerson would
bring his teen-age son and daughter to see him.
   Asked about his jail time, Capasso said, ``Where I was is not a
rock pile. They don't pick pieces out of your skin. But make no
mistake about it, it's jail.
   ``In order to get through it, you have to intellectualize above
it. ... But the depression and oppression, the constant sublimating
depletes your energy. It's exhausting.''
   Capasso was released June 26 from a halfway house in Manhattan.

   Dan Evans, a former U.S. senator and
three-term governor, will begin doing television and radio
commentary in Seattle later this month.
   Evans said his commentaries will be based on his experiences in
politics and said they ``will give me a chance to add to the
intelligence of political dialogue.''
   The 63-year-old Evans was Washington governor from 1965 to 1977,
then served six years as president of Evergreen State College.
   In 1983, he was appointed to the U.S. Senate to replace the late
Sen. Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson, and he won a special election that
fall to serve out Jackson's term. But he opted not to seek a full
term last year.
   Evans said his commentaries will run about 1{ minutes two or
three times a week on the Seattle CBS affiliate, KIRO television;
and on radio stations KIRO-AM and KSEA-FM. He said he will also
take part in covering political stories.
   ``I'll probably be the color man on election nights and during
other political doings,'' he said.
   Since returning from Washington and a fellowship at Harvard,
Evans has joined the boards of Washington Mutual Savings Bank and
McCaw Communications, a cellular telephone and pager company.

<HEAD>Indianapolis Hospital Reports Twins Born With New Fertility Method</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN KUSMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fertility method new to the United States
is safer and less expensive than other artificial methods, a doctor
said Thursday in announcing the birth of twins to a couple who used
the procedure.
   In peritoneal ovum sperm transfer, or POST, mature eggs are
removed from the mother's ovaries and placed along with sperm into
the peritoneal cavity, near the ends of the fallopian tubes. The
egg enters the fallopian tubes, where it is fertilized, and travels
to the uterus for the remainder of gestation.
   Unlike in vitro fertilization, the procedure can be done in a
doctor's office in less than an hour with only local anesthesia,
said Dr. Carolyn B. Coulam, medical director of the Center for
Reproduction and Transplantation Immunology at Methodist Hospital.
   With no hospitalization required, POST costs about $4,000,
compared with $6,000 for in vitro fertilization, Coulam said.
   ``The risks are remarkably less. Moreover, the costs are less,''
she said.
   The doctor said Jane and Michael Donlan of Indianapolis became
the parents of the first children conceived in the United States
under the procedure. Craig Thomas Donlan, who weighed 7 pounds 4
ounces, and his fraternal twin brother, Kyle Robert, at 6 pounds 6
ounces, were born 12 minutes apart Saturday night without
complications.
   Coulam said she believed the first children born under a similar
POST procedure were in London, based on a report of three
pregnancies there in 1987. She said she knows of no others.
   ``We are just thrilled that this procedure has helped us extend
our family and bring us these two beautiful babies,'' Mrs. Donlan
said, surrounded by her family, including a 7-year-old daughter,
Erin. ``It's just really extremely frustrating to be infertile and
not know why.''
   Coulam said Mrs. Donlan, 35, suffered from unexplained
infertility, like about 20 percent of the 3 million infertile women
in the United States. Such women may be able to bear children as a
result of the POST procedure, but it will rarely help the remaining
80 percent, Coulam said.
   ``It does require the patient to have normal fallopian tubes, so
the fallopian tubes pick up the egg and transfer it to the
uterus,'' Coulam said.
   In in vitro fertilization, the egg is fertilized by sperm in a
laboratory dish and surgically transferred to the uterus. Under a
third method, Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer or GIFT, the egg and
sperm are surgically transferred to the fallopian tubes for
fertilization, Coulam said.
   Methodist, the only hospital in the country federally approved
to use the catheter that implants the eggs and sperm in POST
procedures, has one other ongoing pregnancy and two that have
failed, including the first by the Donlans, in the past year,
Coulam said.
   Mrs. Donlan and her 42-year-old husband are computer programmers.

<HEAD>Kaifu Holds First Cabinet Meeting, Promises Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu held his first Cabinet
meeting Thursday and promised political and tax reforms to win back
support for his Liberal Democratic Party.
   ``I want this to be known as the Cabinet of dialogue and
reform,'' Kaifu told reporters before a brief induction ceremony
before Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace.
   The Cabinet will ``ensure a balance of voices from the people,''
he said. ``There are both political reform and tax reform, and I
plan to do both reliably.''
   After the ceremony, the ministers held their first meeting.
   Kaifu, 58, was elected prime minister Wednesday after two
predecessors were forced out of office in the last 10 weeks.
   Naboru Takeshita quit to take responsibility for an
influence-peddling scandal. Sousuke Uno resigned after the Liberal
Democrats suffered a major loss in elections for Parliament's upper
house.
   ``What is important above all is political ethics,'' Kaifu said.
``Without faith in us, we will collapse.''
   News reports said Kaifu planned to visit Washington from Sept.
3-9 and discuss with President Bush moves to ease trade friction
between the two countries.
   A major issue for Kaifu is how to respond to continuing U.S.
demands for greater access to Japan's markets. Opposition from
farmers to a wider opening of Japan's market to agricultural
imports was seen as factor in the Liberal Democrats' loss in the
upper house elections last month.
   The new foreign minister, Taro Nakayama, said a U.S. visit had
not been decided upon.
   Hikaru Matsunaga, the new international trade minister, said
Japan must increase its imports while maintaining a balance between
economic growth led by domestic demand and protection of the
environment.
   Finance Minister Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto ruled out repealing
the widely opposed 3 percent sales tax that took effect in April.
   A repeal move is likely to be launched in Parliament's upper
house, where the Liberal Democrats lost their majority in the July
23 election.
   Kaifu has pledged to review the tax, reportedly planning to use
revenues it generates toward welfare purposes.
   Women were particularly vocal in criticism of the new tax. In
addition, they were incensed over reports that Uno kept paid
mistresses.
   The women's vote was seen as one of the reasons for the Liberal
Democratic loss in July.
   The new Cabinet includes women for the first time _ Sumiko
Takahara, a non-politician and economic expert who is head of the
Economic Planning Agency, and lawmaker Mayumi Moriyama, director of
the Environment Agency.
   ``By listening to the voice of the people, I hope to reduce the
gap between the people'' and the government, Kaifu said.
   ``For that reason I chose people from outside government,'' he
said. ``And to ensure a balance of voices from the people, I
highlighted the appointment of women.''

<HEAD>King Center Confirms Resignation Of Slain Leader's Youngest Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dexter King, the youngest son of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., has resigned as president of
the center named for his father, center officials confirmed
Thursday.
   The resignation had been rumored for several days because of
apparent rifts among the leadership of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Center for Nonviolent Social Change over how it should be managed.
   ``We regret to announce that Dexter Scott King has resigned his
post as president,'' said a statement from King Center board
Chairman Jesse Hill Jr.
   ``It must be borne in mind that the changing circumstances,
staff and management changes and tragic assassinations have not
changed this eternal commitment to social change through creative
love and revolutionary non-violence,'' Hill added.
   Hill's statement did not elaborate on the reasons for Dexter
King's departure, and neither he nor King immediately returned
telephone calls Thursday seeking comment.
   In January, the center's board of directors elected King, 28, to
take over the presidency from his mother, Coretta Scott King, who
remained as chief executive officer. He officially took over April
4, the 21st anniversary of his father's assassination.
   He was touted at the time as an ambitious young leader who
sought a vigorous role in the center, hoping to place it on a solid
financial footing and cut its dependency on donations.
   Civil rights leaders in Atlanta said this week that there has
been conflict within the center's leadership over fiscal and
personnel concerns, and there were reports of a dispute between
King and his mother.
   Mayor Andrew Young, who was an aide to the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. in the '60s, was quoted by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution as saying the resignation was part of a family
dispute fueled by a generation gap.
   City Councilman Hosea Williams, who also was a King aide, said
the center recently had begun to focus more on leading the civil
rights movement, placing itself in competition with the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference founded by the elder King.
   The King Center, located on Atlanta's historic Auburn Avenue,
once the heart of the black community's business district, contains
a museum and Martin Luther King Jr.'s tomb.

   A lesbian minister who claimed to be the
victim of two anti-homosexual assaults fabricated one of the
attacks, police said Thursday.
   ``We feel at this time the case is unfounded,'' said Police
Chief Frank Jordan, referring to the second attack the Rev. Lynn
Griffis had reported to authorities.
   Griffis, an assistant pastor at the Metropolitan Community
Church, had reported that she was attacked once by an intruder
wielding a shovel and later by ``skinheads'' who abducted her and
cut an inscription into her chest.
   Griffis, 26, had blamed both attacks on anti-gay assailants, and
her case became a rallying point for ongoing efforts to fight
so-called gay bashing.
   At a news conference Thursday, Jordan said the matter would be
turned over to the District Attorney's Office.
   He said an investigation into the first attack is continuing. He
declined to speculate on whether that case also might be shown to
be unfounded.
   When her version of the second attack was questioned, Griffis
left San Francisco. Her mother, Adele Griffis, told The Associated
Press by telephone Thursday that her daughter was at the family
home near Cozad, Neb., but was not available for comment.
   ``We're just not going to be talking because there's been so
much damage that's been done,'' she said. ``We're just so
heartbroken.''
   Police and gay leaders in San Francisco last week held a joint
news conference that cast doubt on Griffis' account of the second
attack that she reported last month.
   The first attack was reported July 12. Griffis told police a man
broke into her home and struck her with a shovel. She showed up at
a news conference several hours after the reported assault with
several stitches around her eye.
   The assailant reportedly scribbled ``Kill You Fags'' on the
wall. The church also received a letter the day before the alleged
attack containing death threats against Griffis and pastor Jim
Mitulski.
   Griffis, who marries gay and lesbian couples as part of her
pastoral duties, said after the first reported attack that she
would fight her attacker ``with love and with education.''
   In the second attack, on July 27, Griffis told police she was
briefly abducted by two men she described as ``skinheads'' who made
threats against her and cut her with a switchblade.
   But Aug. 3, police confronted Griffis with inconsistencies in
her account of the second attack, including evidence that her
wounds were self-inflicted. Griffis then changed her account of the
attack, contending it was a sexual assault.
   Mitulski and the church's board of directors had placed Griffis
on leave after the inconsistencies were publicized. She later
resigned.
   The Metropolitan Community Church is a non-denominational
Christian church that caters chiefly to homosexuals. It has
branches in several cities.
   Another alleged attack by ``skinheads'' in San Francisco has
also been called into question.
   In April, syndicated talk show host Morton Downey Jr. said he
had been attacked by neo-Nazi skinheads in a restroom at San
Francisco International Airport. He said they tried to shave his
head and scribbled reverse swastikas on is face and clothing. But
airport authorities said they could not substantiate any of his
claims. Downey's talk show has since been canceled.

<HEAD>State Issues Policy For Registering Homeless Voters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has adopted a policy allowing
people to register to vote even if they have no residence other
than a park bench, a decision praised by an organization for the
homeless.
   ``To the best of our knowledge, Maine is the only state to
handle it in this manner,'' without prodding from the courts, said
Richard Pinner at the New York office of the National Coalition for
the Homeless.
   ``As a matter of symbolism, I think it's good,'' Pinner said.
   Secretary of State G. William Diamond said Wednesday that even
if people claim a park bench as their residence and a food bank as
their mailing address, they must be permitted to register to vote.
   He said all reasonable action must be taken to ensure the voting
rights of the homeless.
   ``Any denial leaves a homeless person, whose survival depends on
political decisions, with no political recourse,'' Diamond said.
   He outlined the policy in a letter to registrars, citing
successful court challenges in other states to residence
requirements that restrict the voting rights of the homeless.
   The president of the Maine Town and City Clerks Association,
whose members had expressed concern to Diamond about the lack of a
consistent policy on homeless voters, said his liberal
interpretation of residency requirements probably would generate
opposition, particularly in rural areas.
   ``Some of the clerks are not going to be happy with that,'' said
Brenda Caldwell, town clerk in Gorham.
   Diamond said estimates of homeless people living in Maine range
from 500 to 2,000.
   In Portland, Maine's most populous city, a registrar said
officials in recent years have routinely assigned homeless people
the address of City Hall so they may vote.

   Walkouts spread Thursday in Estonia to include up
to 20,000 workers, and protest leaders said they had no plans to
call off the 2-day-old protest against a new election law, reports
from the Baltic republic said.
   In a bid to stop the strike, the Estonian parliament passed a
resolution Thursday suspending all strikes at enterprises and
organizations in Estonia, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said the decree would take effect as
soon as it was published and directed the government to ``ensure
uninterrupted functioning of the Estonian economy and services to
the population.''
   The strike by non-Estonian workers was sparked by a new law that
tightens residency requirements for voting and holding office.
Non-Estonian residents of the republic complain that the law, which
was passed Tuesday by the republic's parliament, is aimed against
them because many are new arrivals.
   An editor at Estonian Radio, Maarika Saarna, put the number of
strikers at 20,000 but cautioned it could be exaggerated because it
was based largely on reports from the strikers themselves.
   Strike committee member Artur Kopykin refused to estimate the
number of strikers but said 37 enterprises had joined the walkout.
On Wednesday, 22 enterprises were reported on strike, including
shipyards and a motor works.
   Kopykin said the government had not begun negotiations with
strikers and ``has made no move to come toward us.''
   ``Until the government starts negotiations, there can be no talk
about stopping the strike,'' he said by telephone from Tallinn, the
republic's capital.
   Saarna said strike agitators were trying to stir up non-Estonian
workers by warning them they would soon be treated as badly as
blacks under apartheid in South Africa.
   ``If you tell a rather illiterate person that this is our last
chance and otherwise we'll be kicked out, of course he'll strike,''
she said in a telephone interview. ``
   The government newspaper Izvestia reported Thursday that
``alienation is growing between two groups of the population in
Estonia.''
   It said that on Tallinn's central square, Estonians have set up
a protest mourning the death of an Estonian who was killed Saturday
night in a drunken brawl with a Russian. They hold signs saying
``On this spot, a drunken Russian from Moscow killed an Estonian
boy,'' Izvestia said.
   Yevgeny Kogan, an ethnic Russian and leader of the InterMovement
group that lobbies for non-Estonians' interests, said strikers were
demanding the republic's parliament reconsider ``discriminative''
parts of the law on elections and another law making Estonian the
republic's official language.
   He said in an interview Thursday the new election law would
deprive tens of thousands of people of the right to vote. The new
law requires that candidates for elective office live in the same
place for five years, or in Estonia for 10 years. Voters must have
lived in the same district for two years or in Estonia for five.
   Kopykin claimed the strike had virtually paralyzed the railroads
in Estonia and had spread to the construction industry.
   Some disruption in morning bus traffic was reported in Tallinn,
but drivers were brought in from out of town to fill in, Saarna
said.
   Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the
population, and pushed the law to protect themselves from an influx
of other nationalities. Russians make up about a third of Estonia's
1.6 million people.

<HEAD>Farmer's First State-Certified Organic Crop Accidentally Sprayed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROYAL CITY, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A farmer who spent years developing a
crop of organically grown beans saw his effort wasted in a few
airplane passes when his field was accidentally sprayed with
pesticides.
   ``In my mind, the beans are not only ruined, but the ground is
contaminated,'' said Peter Eriksen, who has been farming pinto and
garden beans without chemicals for 13 years. ``This is quite
devastating to me.''
   Years of building the field's fertility, through the spreading
of manure and other organic means, were ruined, Eriksen said.
   ``I'm different than commercial chemical farmers in that I
consider the soil to be a biologically active, and it's a fact, not
just my belief,'' Eriksen said.
   The state Department of Agriculture, which started an organic
certification program last year, is investigating the accidental
spraying. Department officials say it will be three years before
they can once again certify crops grown on Eriksen's 60-acre
sprayed field as organic.
   ``That about makes me cry,'' Eriksen said.
   Eriksen was tending to his sloping field on the west end of this
central Washington town on July 18 when he noticed two low-flying
airplanes overhead.
   ``From my vantage point, I couldn't determine if he was spraying
on a neighbor's field or on my field. ... Then I could see when he
came around again that he was spraying in my field.''
   The second plane started spraying on the west side.
   Ericksen said he frantically waved his arms to signal one of the
pilots, but to no avail. He then picked up a 4-inch aluminum pipe
and began waving that. The planes finally flew away.
   Pilot Randy Ferguson of Stephens Flying Service, who was
contracted to spray neighboring farms, said he thought the farmer
was trying to warn him away from cattle.
   ``We were in an area where we normally don't fly. Beans look
like beans from an airplane,'' said Ferguson, who has been in the
business for 13 years and said he didn't know there were organic
crops in Grant County.
   The planes apparently mistook Eriksen's field for one a couple
of miles southwest.
   Eriksen said a Seattle insurance agent for the flying service
told him the maximum liability of the policy was $100,000. He said
he plans to file a lawsuit seeking ``well, well above that amount.''
   Eriksen estimated that his organic beans could have brought him
twice the price of a regular crop because of the growing demand for
pesticide-free foods. Carrie West of the agriculture department's
certification program advisory board agreed.
   There are 150 farmers, most in eastern Washington, who received
organic certification from the state Agriculture Department this
year, said program manager Verne Hedlund.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Bonanno Threw Posh Wedding After Lawyer Paid By Taxpayers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of a reputed Mafia boss threw a
$72,000 wedding party ``worthy of royalty'' for his daughter, just
three months after taxpayers picked up the tab for his attorney's
fee, prosecutors said.
   Salvatore ``Bill'' Bonanno had claimed he was too poor to pay
his attorney $19,250 for appealing his convictions in a
home-improvement scam.
   The October 1988 wedding party came complete with filet mignon,
ice sculptures and a 14-piece orchestra, state Deputy Attorney
General Derald Granberg said in papers filed Wednesday in Superior
Court.
   Granberg, who successfully prosecuted Bonanno for bilking four
elderly Alameda County residents of more than $40,000 in the late
1970s, is objecting to Bonanno's latest attempt to avoid serving a
four-year term.
   ``This defendant belongs in state prison, it is as simple as
that,'' Granberg said.
   Bonanno, 57, is the son of reputed mob boss Joseph Bonanno Sr.
The younger Bonanno is scheduled to return to court Aug. 18, when
he is scheduled to begin serving his sentence. Superior Court Judge
Joseph Karesh is expected to decide between prison and probation.
   Karesh sentenced Bonanno in March 1986 for his convictions four
months earlier on eight counts of grand theft and conspiracy to
commit theft for the bogus home-improvement contracts.
   Bonanno, however, was allowed to remain free on $50,000 bail
while he unsucessfully appealed his convictions. Karesh then
ordered Bonanno to surrender June 16, but allowed a two-month delay
to help his 84-year-old father, who is facing charges of refusing
to testify before a federal grand jury in New York.
   But last month, Bonanno's lawyer, Charles Garry, asked Karesh to
modify the four-year sentence to probation. Garry said that since
the sentence, Bonanno has lived ``an utterly blameless life.''
   Granberg called Bonanno the ``dominant'' member of the
conspiracy and criticized Garry for accepting public funds to
represent Bonanno.
   Granberg said Bonanno is being sued by the Fairmont Hotel in San
Jose for failing to pay most of the $72,000 tab for the wedding
party of his daughter, Felippa.
   ``The conclusion suggested by this scenario is that the
defendant perpetrated a fraud upon either the (state) or the hotel
or both,'' Granberg said.

   Militiamen allied with Israel attacked
and slightly injured two U.N. peacekeepers who tried to stop a
roundup of Shiite Moslems after an Israeli convoy was bombed, U.N
reports said Thursday.
   Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian group believed to sponsor
hostage-holders, took responsibility for the suicide truck bombing
Wednesday, which wounded five Israeli soldiers and a member of the
allied South Lebanon Army militia.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual adviser of
Hezbollah, called it a ``down payment'' of retaliation for Israel's
abduction July 28 of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite cleric
affiliated with the organization.
   ``Much more will follow,'' Fadlallah said. Hezbollah, whose name
means Party of God, said the explosives-laden pickup was driven by
a 24-year-old Shiite clergyman.
   A U.N. source, speaking anonymously, said the predominantly
Christian militia was conducting house-to-house roundups in Ibl
el-Saqi and Rashaya villages in the ``security zone'' Israel
maintains just north of its border.
   ``The SLA militiamen threw hand grenades at the Norwegian
soldiers manning a checkpoint there,'' he said.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the peacekeepers, said grenades were
drawn but not thrown. He said the two Norwegians were injured
Wednesday, by flying stones, when militiamen fired at their legs.
   When 15 to 20 militiamen were refused passage through a U.N.
checkpoint, Goksel said, ``They put a gun at a man's head and then
they pulled out hand grenades. Then they began firing at the ground
and the soldier's legs.''
   He said the second incident was similar.
   Another U.N. official said privately the U.N. command told the
Israeli army ``they control these guys and they should exercise
more of that control before somebody gets killed.''
   An Iranian newspaper said Thursday indirect talks between Iran
and the United States on the hostage situation would begin within
days.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
English-language Tehran Times, which is close to President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, as saying talks would be conducted through a third
country, probably Pakistan.
   Later Thursday, however, the agency issued a dispatch saying
reports of talks with the United States were ``suspicious'' and
quoted sources as saying none were being held.
   It quoted one unidentified source as saying the United States
had sent messages ``through certain third governments,'' but they
were rejected because some had an ``insolent tone.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it
was ``premature'' to expect direct talks with Tehran and ``we're
nowhere near that,'' but indicated indirect contacts would continue.
   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. Israel has offered to trade Obeid and the estimated
300-400 other Shiites it holds for three Israeli soldiers held in
Lebanon and all the hostages.
   President Bush said Wednesday he would pursue every diplomatic
channel, but would not engage in ``trading off or negotiating.''
   In Jerusalem, an aide to Yitzhak Shamir said Bush and the
Israeli prime minister had agreed to coordinate their efforts to
free foreign hostages and Israeli prisoners.
   Avi Pazner said the decision was reached in a 10-minute
telephone call Wednesday from Shamir to Bush. Pazner's office said
Bush did not mention the Obeid abuction, which the United States
has criticized.
   Fitzwater said: ``We've generally tried to be forthcoming with
what we are doing, and they have been forthcoming wth what they're
doing. However, I would not characterize it as coordination.''
   In a statement released Thursday, Bush said: ``This Sunday
millions of Americans of every faith will attend worship services.
... I ask that each of you say a special prayer ... for the
American hostages being held in Lebanon.''
   Ash-Shiraa, a Beirut weekly, quoted ``non-Arab'' sources as
saying armed women were moving the hostages to new hideouts in
Beirut and its suburbs. The paper said the women, dressed in long
black chadors, worked at night, carrying automatic weapons to be
used only under ``utmost necessity.''
   Its report could not be verified independently. Ash-Shiraa
gained recognition in November 1986 with the first story about the
Iran-Contra deal to exchange U.S. arms for hostages. Its recent
reporting on the hostages has not been accurate.
   The South Lebanon Army radio Voice of the South said the
militiamen rounded up several young Shiite men. It said most of the
arrests were made in Khiyam village, where about 50,000 Shiites
live.
   Khiyam also is in the buffer zone, an area 6 to 10 miles deep
patrolled by Israel soldiers and the surrogate militia.
   Uri Lubrani, Israel's coordinator for south Lebanon, said
Wednesday the Israelis would retaliate for the attack on the
convoy, but did not say where or when.
   A statement from the SLA militia command said, without
elaborating, that gateways to the ``security zone'' from the rest
of Lebanon would be closed until Sunday. A south Lebanon security
source said the SLA wanted to ``prevent possible collaborators with
the suicide bomber from leaving the zone.''
   Police said Hezbollah was abandoning regular bases as a
precaution against Israeli air strikes.
   A police spokesman said small groups of Hezbollah fighters,
carrying shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles, were seen overnight moving
into wooded mountain slopes that surround the Syrian-occupied Bekaa
Valley in eastern Lebanon.
   In south Beirut, he said, Hezbollah had moved into a ``chain of
basements and underground shelters.''
   Hezbollah has refused to negotiate a prisoner exchange with
Israel. It said the West should force Israel to free Obeid, and
described Israel's claims about statements the cleric made under
interrogation as ``false and misleading.''
   Israeli officials have said Obeid confessed to helping plan
attacks on Israel and the abduction Feb. 17, 1988, of Lt. Col.
William Higgins while he was on U.N. duty in south Lebanon.
   Higgins' captors said July 31 they had hanged the U.S. Marine
officer in retaliation for Obeid's abduction, but the question of
when he died remains unresolved. Some reports say he was killed
last year.

<TEXT>
   One of the attorneys defending New York hotel
owner Leona Helmsley at her tax-evasion trial is expected to
oversee criminal tax prosecutions at the Justice Department,
sources said Thursday.
   James A. Bruton III is the choice of Assistant Attorney General
Shirley Peterson, head of the Justice Department's tax division, to
run the unit's criminal-tax section, said department sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bruton's appointment as deputy assistant attorney general is not
expected to be announced until after the conclusion of the New York
City trial of Mrs. Helmsley, who appears in advertisements as ``the
queen of the Helmsley Hotels.''
   Bruton is part of a four-attorney team defending charges that
Mrs. Helmsley and her husband, Harry, evaded payment of $1 million
of federal taxes by reporting $4 million worth of renovations on
their mansion as business expenses.
   During a break in his cross-examination of an IRS agent
testifying for the prosecution Thursday, Bruton said ``I can't
comment'' when asked about the expected appointment.
   The Helmsley case one of the most publicized criminal tax cases
brought by the Justice Department in recent years.
   Prosecutors charge the renovations on the Helmsleys' Greenwich,
Conn., estate that were written off as business expenses included
the installation of a marble dance floor and sound system to pipe
music to a barbecue pit.
   Mrs. Helmsley and her husband head a $5 billion hotel and real
estate empire. Helmsley, 80, is also charged but is not being tried
because he was declared mentally incompetent.
   The prosecution charged in its opening statement that Mrs.
Helmsley used the hotel business as ``a personal piggy bank,''
charging numerous personal purchases as business expenses,
including two jade figurines worth $500,000.
   A partner at the Washington law firm of Williams &amp; Connolly,
Bruton, 39, was a trial attorney in the Justice Department's tax
division from 1977 until 1981. Before that he worked two years in
the general counsel's office of the Internal Revenue Service.
   The prosecution is expected to rest its case early next week and
the case should go to a jury after a brief parade of defense
witnesses.
   Also on trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan are former
Helmsley hotel executive Frank Turco and Joseph Licari, once a top
aide to Mr. Helmsley.

<TEXT>
   Members of a commission
promoting peace talks between the rightist government and
Marxist-led insurgents said Thursday they found good will and
determination to resolve the nearly 10-year-old war.
   The commission, which comprises the three main opposition
parties, spoke just hours after rebels used a dump truck to plow
through a sentry position and attack an army post in the capital's
northern sector.
   Officials of the Christian Democratic Party, the National
Reconciliation Party and the Democratic Convergence are included in
the commission.
   The Christian Democrats handed over power on June 1 to President
Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance,
or Arena, which won a landslide victory in March presidential
elections.
   Four rounds of negotiations between 1984 and 1987 failed to end
the civil war, in which about 70,000 people have died.
   In his inaugural address, Cristiani offered to talk with the
rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. But the insurgents
rejected the mechanism for dialogue _ a non-governmental commission
_ suggested by the new president.
   The rebels want direct high-level negotiations with the
government.
   ``We have found that the political will to dialogue exists on
both sides. There are points of agreement, but there is also
distance and mistrust,'' said oppositon leader Hugo Carrillo. ``We
of the opposition political parties are serving as promoters of
dialogue in an effort to narrow that difference.''
   Central American presidents who met earlier this week in Tela,
Honduras urged that Salvadoran peace negotiations be resumed.
   Commission members met in late July with rebel commanders in
Mexico City and this week with Cristiani. They said both sides
encouraged them to continue the effort to create conditions for
talks.
   They said they expected both sides to make ``concrete gestures''
to emphasize their dedication to achieving a negotiated peace.
Carrillo said the commission had not discussed with the two sides
what such measures might be.
   But Carrillo mentioned as possibilities a rebel cease-fire and
an end to a government attempt to pass laws considered repressive
by the opposition.
   Cristiani has said he plans to introduce draft legislation
giving the police, armed forces and courts a freer hand in moving
against suspected subversives. The oppositon and human rights
organizations have described the proposed measures as totalitarian.
   The rebel attack began at dawn at the army post in Mejicanos, in
northern San Salvador. Sgt. Arturo Melendez, post commander, said
one soldier and one civilian were wounded.
   Another guerrilla squad ambushed a truck carrying National Guard
members to reinforce the Mejicanos post, killing one trooper and
wounding two, authorities said.
   Melendez told journalists that about 30 insurgents fired
rocket-propelled grenades at the post and sprayed it with automatic
weapons fire.
   The attack began when guerrillas aboard a dump truck smashed
through a roadblock on the post's perimeter. The rebels also fired
grenades at the Mejicanos town hall, destroying its door.
   About 8,000 leftist rebels have waged a nearly decade-long
battle against the U.S.-backed governments in El Salvador. They say
they want to change the economic system that has enriched a tiny
minority while leaving most Salvadorans destitute.

<HEAD>Ag Department Estimates Lower Soviet Grain Production</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department on Thursday
estimated Soviet grain production this year at 200 million metric
tons, 10 million below earlier forecasts, and said there would be a
resulting rise in imports.
   The department estimated grain imports by the Soviets in the
year that began July 1 at 36 million tons, 3 million above previous
estimates.
   Hot and dry weather across many of the spring wheat-growing
regions of the Soviet Union combined with a shrinkage in the
growing area are causing the drop, according to a report from the
Foreign Agriculture Service.
   It estimated wheat production down 4.5 million tons to 87
million, while coarse grains decreased by 5.5 million to 100
million.
   Over the last 14 years, Soviet grain production fell to its
lowest level, 140.1 million metric tons, in 1975 and climbed to its
high of 237.4 million in 1978. Grain production reached 211.4
million in 1987 and 195.1 million last year.
   This year, favorable conditions across much of the European
portion of the Soviet Union have failed to fully offset hot and dry
weather baking out soil moisture from the eastern Urals to western
Sibera, USDA said. It said cooler weather and showers in the last
week came too late to rescue spring grains.

<HEAD>Bush Declares California Coastal Area Marine Sanctuary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday formally designated
a 397-square-acre region off Northern California as a national
marine sanctuary, outlawing oil, gas and mineral exploration there.
   Bush signed a House-Senate resolution to implement the ban in
the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, offshore from Point
Reyes, in what is considered one of the West's most sensitive
marine regions.
   The move brought praise from Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who
urged a permanent ban on oil and gas drilling for all marine
sanctuaries as proposed in legislation she has sponsored with Rep.
Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   The marine sanctuary lies within Lease Sale 119, which covers a
massive part of the outer continental shelf off Central California,
where oil exploration could have begun as early as 1991 without the
ban.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, when
initially proposing Cordell Bank as a marine sanctuary during the
Reagan administration, did not propose to ban oil and gas
exploration.
   Subsequently the agency did push for such a ban, but faced
objections from the Interior Department until the White House sided
with NOAA, according to congressional and administration sources.
   Congress, which has the power to disapprove a marine sanctuary
designation or change the terms governing it, accepted language by
West Coast lawmakers to include the ban.
   ``We had no objection to that,'' said White House spokesman
Steve Hart.
   ``The administration was moving ahead to do exactly this,''
through regulatory procedures, as distinct from the congressional
action which makes the ban a law, said another official.
   The sanctuary is 20 nautical miles west of Point Reyes and 50
nautical miles west northwest of San Francisco, just north of the
Farellones National Marine Sanctuary.
   Cordell Bank forms an underwater plateau 300 to 400 feet below
the surface with pinnacles and ridges that rise to within 115 feet
of the surface.
   Nutrients combined with high light penetration produce a unique
biological community of algae, invertebrates, fish, marine mammals
and seabirds, including the humpback whale and short-tailed
albatross, NOAA reports say.
   The House vote last June to ban offshore drilling in the
sanctuary was the first approval of a permanent ban on offshore
drilling by a chamber of Congress.
   Temporary, renewable moratoriums have been enacted repeatedly
along the California coast, blocking new drilling for the last
eight years.

   Israel's militia allies in south Lebanon attacked two U.N.

Israeli convoy was bombed, according to U.N reports.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the peacekeepers, said the two
Norwegian soldiers were injured by flying stones Wednesday when
militiamen were refused passage at a checkpoint and fired at their
legs.
   Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian group believed to sponsor
hostage-holders, took responsibility for the suicide truck bombing
Wednesday, which wounded five Israeli soldiers and a member of the

   An Iranian newspaper said indirect talks between Iran and the

   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the

Rafsanjani, as saying talks would be conducted through a third
country, probably Pakistan.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of the Shamir-Bush

   He said it was ``premature'' to expect direct talks with Iran
and ``we're nowhere near that,'' but indicated indirect contacts

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusual show of bipartisanship, four New York
Republicans have contributed to the re-election campaign of Rep.
Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., who is under indictment in the Wedtech
bribery scandal.
   Two of the four _ Reps. Benjamin Gilman Frank Horton _ serve
with Garcia on the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee.
Gilman contributed $100; Horton, dean of the state's House
delegation, gave $1,000.
   Reps. Norman Lent and Amo Houghton also gave $1,000 each to
Garcia, according to the Bronx Democrat's latest campaign finance
report filed with the Federal Election Commission.
   Lent even sent a letter earlier this year to all 13 New York
House Republicans asking them to help with Garcia's legal defense,
said John Hambel, a spokesman for Lent.
   Although Michael Mensch, a spokesman for Garcia, agreed it was
unusual for Republicans to give financial support to a Democrat, he
said, ``Republicans don't run against Democrats in the South
Bronx.''
   ``It's not like they're operating against their own party,'' he
said.
   But Howard Schloss, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, said Republicans ``have set out this grand
strategy to try to beat Democratic incumbents'' and called the
contributions ``very embarrassing.''
   Garcia faces trial Sept. 11 on felony charges that he and his
wife, Jane, accepted bribes of cash and jewelry worth $185,000 from
the Wedtech Corp., a New York military contractor. Garcia's former
House colleague, Mario Biaggi was convicted last year of taking
bribes from Wedtech and is serving an eight-year prison sentence in
Texas.
   Twenty Democratic members from outside New York also contributed
to Garcia's re-election campaign in the first six months of 1989,
according to the FEC report.
   Most of the $171,725 that Garcia's campaign collected between
Jan. 1 and June 30 has gone for his legal defense, according to the
report. Garcia reimbursed himself $130,000 in legal fees from the
campaign, the report says.

<HEAD>Former Justice Official a Candidate for Deputy Attorney General</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Justice Department official is being
considered to be deputy attorney general, a position vacant because
of controversy surrounding the original candidate, an
administration source said Thursday.
   Donald B. Ayer, a former deputy solicitor general who served
five years as U.S. attorney in Sacramento, Calif., is a candidate
for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department, said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The job has been vacant since Harold G. Christiansen resigned
last spring.
   Robert B. Fiske Jr., a New York attorney who was the original
choice of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, withdrew from
consideration after Senate conservatives threatened a lengthy
confirmation battle if he were nominated.
   A number of conservative Republicans accused Fiske of scuttling
President Reagan's judicial nominees when he chaired the American
Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary. Fiske's
critics urged President Bush against making the nomination.
   Fiske, a partner in a Wall Street firm who was once U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, bowed out from consideration last month.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel refused to comment on
whether Ayer was the candidate under consideration whom he had
discussed earlier in the week. Runkel had said the FBI had not yet
completed a background check on a candidate, whom he did not
identify.
   Ayer, who was out of town and unavailable for comment, is a
partner in the Washington office of the Cleveland law firm of
Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue.
   He joined the firm in late 1988 after serving for two years as
deputy solicitor general at the Justice Department under Solicitor
General Charles Fried.
   He was U.S. attorney in Sacramento, Calif., from 1981 to 1986,
an element of his resume that Thornburgh considers critical
experience for the job, the source said.
   A native of San Mateo, Calif., Ayer, 40, is a 1971 graduate of
Stanford University and received his law degree from Harvard in
1975.
   He clerked for then-Circuit Judge Malcolm Wilkey on the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here before becoming a law clerk to
Supreme Court Justice William H. Rehnquist during the high court's
1976-77 term.

   A letter carrier armed with enough
ammunition for an extended siege shot his wife to death, then drove
to a post office and killed two co-workers before ending the spree
with a gun blast to his head, police said.
   John Merlin Taylor was brain dead at a hospital after the
shootings at the Postal Service's downtown Orange Glen substation,
officials said.
   ``He fired well over a dozen rounds and there are expended cases
all over the floor there,'' said police Lt. Earl Callander. ``There
is also a box of about 100 rounds that apparently was going to be
used for reloading.''
   Taylor, who had received numerous model-employee awards during
his 27 years with the Postal Service, had discussed a similar
outburst in a Post Office two days earlier, a friend said.
   Callander said Taylor was carrying a handgun and ammunition when
he entered an employee entrance and began shooting at about 7:30
a.m.
   ``We have no indication he was looking for a specific person or
a target. It was a High Standard .22-caliber that shoots long rifle
bullets that can be deadly when it hits its target,'' the
lieutenant said.
   In addition to the two employees killed, another was shot in the
arm and several others suffered minor injuries in the panic to flee
the building, 30 miles northeast of downtown San Diego.
   Taylor, 52, was taken to Palomar Hospital where he was declared
brain dead, said police spokeswoman Susan Reierson. Hospital
spokeswoman Pat Rarus would only say: ``He's very, very critical
and on life support systems.''
   ``I heard a low popping at first, then a banging,'' said window
clerk William Karlson. ``The first thing that I knew something was
really serious was when (clerk) Roger Hutchinson yelled, `This is
for real. Clear the building. Everybody get out.'
   ``Then I saw Taylor walking with his gun. I was in an aisle, but
he didn't look at me. I left the building and when I came back
Roger said he (Taylor) had shot himself.''
   Afterward, police went to Taylor's Escondido home and found his
wife, Elizabeth, dead from a gunshot wound, Reierson said.
   Taylor had worked as a letter carrier for 27 years and was
nearing retirement, and Postal Service spokesman Bob Henley said he
was being considered for another quarterly performance award but
declined nomination.
   ``I have gotten it numerous times and would rather someone else
have a chance at it,'' Henley quoted Taylor as saying.
   On Tuesday, Taylor mentioned a 1986 Oklahoma post office
shooting, in which 15 people were killed, during a discussion with
friend and co-worker Johnny Sims.
   ``We were talking about something and got around to saying,
`What if something happened to one of the employees that would have
gotten him mad and to go berserk?' We were just joking around,''
said Sims, adding he was surprised by the violence.
   ``John was a happy-go-lucky guy always. You could never make him
mad,'' he said. He was not at the post office at the time of the
shootings.
   On Aug. 20, 1986, part-time letter carrier Patrick Sherrill
walked into the Edmond, Okla., post office and killed 14 co-workers
before killing himself. Six people were wounded. Sherrill had been
reprimanded by his supervisors before the shootings.
   The two postal workers killed Thursday were identified as
Richard Berni, 38, and Ron Williams, 56.
   Three psychologists were sent in by the Postal Service to
counsel upset employees.

   The nose of a Trump Shuttle jet skidded down a
runway, throwing out a spray of sparks and smoke, after the Boeing
727 landed Thursday with its nose landing gear still retracted.
   There were no injuries among the 47 passengers and seven
crewmembers on the Boeing 727, according to Trump Shuttle officials.
   ``It was like a roller coaster ride like at Coney Island, and I
enjoyed that. You prepare yourself for the worst. But it was really
just like a rough regular landing,'' said passenger Glenn Porter of
New York.
   ``The pilot did an outstanding job,'' FAA spokesman John Mogul
said. ``The pilot held the nose off the ground, then lowered the
nose slowly to the runway.''
   The pilot, Capt. Robert Smith, de-emphasized his efforts and
said 727s are ``fabulous'' aircraft.
   ``This was all in a day's work as far as I'm concerned,'' said
Smith, 47, a former Navy pilot.
   He flew for Eastern Airlines for 19 years before billionaire New
York City developer Donald Trump bought Eastern's Shuttle,
including planes and landing rights for $365 million, and
inaugurated service under his own name on June 8. The Shuttle
offers frequent service among Boston, New York and Washington.
   Trump flew into Boston for an afternoon news conference.
   ``I think the whole crew is made up of heroes,'' said Trump,
adding that he did not anticipate any negative customer reaction
over the incident.
   ``I think the public confidence might be greater because of our
crew,'' Trump said.
   The plane, coming from New York's LaGuardia Airport, circled
Boston for nearly an hour, dumping fuel over the ocean and flying
roller-coaster ``G-force'' maneuvers trying to shake the nose gear
loose. The jet also made one rough touch-and-go landing _ banging
the main landing gear onto the ground and taking off again _ in an
effort to jar the front landing gear loose from its housing.
   After circling several more times, Smith settled the main
landing gear onto the runway and held the nose up as long as he
could.
   ``The people in the front were screaming and yelling,'' said
James Moriarty of New York. The pilot ``said be prepared for metal
on concrete. So that's what we were preparing for. It wasn't that
bad, though. You felt like you were just waiting for the nose to
drop.''
   Many passengers said the scariest moments came after the
landing, when firefighters sprayed the plane with foam and they
rushed to slide down emergency chutes.
   It was the second emergency landing involving a landing gear
problem in a little over a week in the United States. On Aug. 2, a
Piedmont Airlines Boeing 737 with 100 people aboard scraped its
left wing and engine at Greensboro, N.C., after its left main
landing gear jammed. No one was injured.
   Trump Shuttle president Bruce Nobles said the jet involved in
Thursday's emergency landing had been in service since January
1970, but said age was an unlikely factor in the incident.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating.
   Passengers aboard the Trump plane said they had plenty of
warning.
   ``When they first said they had problems, everybody was just
kind of joking about it,'' said Charlie Cormay of Sudbury. ``Once
we realized there was going to be a crash landing, everybody got
pretty solemn.''
   When the plane finally came in for its landing, Cormay said, ``a
few prayers'' went through his mind.
   ``They prepared us very well,'' said Kathy Hussey of New York
City, who had come to Boston for a business meeting. ``By the time
we landed, we were all very happy and relieved.''
   ``Suddenly you were on the runway with foam on your face and on
your back,'' she said, adding that she probably would take the
train back to New York.
   Passenger Moriarty said many of the travelers were on business,
which he credited with the calm atmosphere. ``They were thinking of
their business appointments,'' he said.
   However, he added: ``People were holding hands with strangers,
which I thought was a nice gesture.''

<TEXT>
   The state's most famous tourists, George
and Barbara Bush, are lampooned in a new comic book that features
them traveling incognito through Maine to escape the pressures of
the White House.
   ``We thought this was too good not to do,'' cartoonist Jeff Pert
said Thursday, after the comic he and Thomas Wilson created, ``On
the Road with George &amp; Barbara in Vacationland!'' had been on the
stands in Maine and Washington just two days.
   ``We just thought it was a perfect market for a humorous
perspective of the president, since he has a summer home here,''
Pert said in an interview. ``We saw it as a vehicle that would
appeal to both the tourists visiting Maine and the locals.''
   The story begins with Bush and the so-called First Dog, Millie,
being invaded by a herd of journalists while they're fighting over
a bar of soap in the White House bathroom. To get away from it all,
Bush and the First Lady disguise themselves as tourists. They
realize they have everybody fooled when the Secret Service doesn't
even recognize them as they take off for ``Vacationland,'' as Maine
calls itself on auto license plates.
   Their adventures take them through numerous scenes peppered with
inside humor, such as references to real estate developers who are
hated by thousands of Mainers and Stephen King, the famous horror
writer who lives in Bangor. In one frame, the Bushes find that the
first lighthouse they run into has been turned into a condominium
and the first lobstermen they meet does not live in a quaint
fishing village, as they expected.
   ``Quaint fishermen ain't lived in quaint fishing villages ever
since quaint out-of-staters bought every quaint damn yard of quaint
shore property,'' the lobsterman says. The Bushes themselves have
been accused by some of spoiling the atmosphere of Kennebunkport,
as Secret Service agents and members of the national press corps
pour into the tiny fishing town whenever the president visits his
estate on Walkers Point.
   Pert, 30, a warehouse worker who draws cartoons for the weekly
Maine Times and The Times Record in Brunswick, and Wilson, 29, a
graphic designer who draws cartoons for the Journal Tribune in
Biddeford, decided they'd collaborate on the book after they met at
a trade convention in April.
   They said they couldn't resist taking a few digs at Bush,
hitting on the ``wimp factor'' that dogged him on the campaign
trail, but they insist they are much kinder and gentler than the
``Doonesbury'' strips that portray Bush as invisible.
   ``When we sat down to do it, I don't think we said we're going
to be very hard on him or very easy,'' Pert said. ``What we've come
up with here is a lot softer than, say, `Doonesbury.'''
   Still, the two are unsure how the president will react if and
when he sees the book during an extended vacation to Kennebunkport
that begins next week.
   ``I'm sure when he gets here for vacation ...'' Pert pauses.
   ``We'll be marked men,'' Wilson answers.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is supplying
Afghanistan with new MIG-29 fighters and the latest Sukhoi
ground-attack jets in case of an attack by Pakistan, an Afghan
general said Thursday.
   The communist government has repeatedly accused Pakistan,
Afghanistan's eastern neighbor, of direct involvement in the Afghan
civil war. The most active Moslem guerrilla groups are based there.
   Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Ulumi, a member of the Supreme Military
Council, said the contract for MIG-29s and SU-27s ``has been
completed,'' but he would not give the number of aircraft.
   ``Soon they will come. We will use them if necessary,'' he said
in an interview with several Western television journalists.
   Yuli M. Vorontsov, the Soviet ambassador, said in June that the
Kremlin was ready to meet an Afghan request for MIG-29s and the
latest Sukhois if fighting and border violations increased.
   A U.S. official was quoted at the time as saying delivery of the
planes would raise ``very serious questions not simply about
Afghanistan, but about Soviet interest in improved relations with
the United States more generally.''
   The Soviets have complained publicly about increased U.S. arms
shipments to the insurgents.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978. Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979
and completed a U.N.-mediated withdrawal a decade later, Feb. 15 of
this year.
   Washington accuses Moscow of nearly doubling arms shipments to
Afghanistan since the withdrawal.
   Last month, a U.S. official said the Soviets were shipping from
$2.5 billion to $3 billion worth of weapons a year to Afghanistan.
U.S. shipments to the guerrillas, via Pakistan, were valued at
slightly more than $600 million.
   Both nations are guarantors of the April 1988 agreement
providing for Soviet military withdrawal and an end to involvement
in Afghanistan. They regularly accuse each other of violating its
provisions.
   U.S. officials said last month American arms shipments to the
guerrillas would continue. They have been quoted as saying the
insurgents willl get new weapons to counter high-altitude bombing
attacks and disable runways at air bases.
   Ulumi, who represents the armed forces on the Communist Party
Central Committee, mentioned the aircraft when asked whether
Afghanistan would be getting new weapons.
   ``The Soviets have promised to give us new weapons,'' he said.
``These are aircraft which are to defend Afghanistan in the face of
a possible Pakistani air attack.''
   Asked what kind of aircraft, he replied: ``MIG-29s and SU-27s.
The numbers are secret. The contract has been completed.''
   Rockets hit Kabul for the seventh day in a row Thursday, killing
nine civilians, all but one at a bus stop near the airport, the
government said. Sixteen people were reported wounded.
   At least seven rockets struck near the airport and in
northwestern Kabul, said Mohammad Nabi Amani, the Foreign Ministry
spokesman.
   He said 16 rockets hit the capital Wednesday, killing one person
and wounding 15.
   In the past week, more than 150 surface-to-surface missiles have
landed in the city, killing 30 people and wounding about 140 by
government count.

   The Roman Catholic church on Thursday
suspended an agreement to move nuns from a convent on the edge of
Auschwitz, and blamed Jewish groups for creating an ``atmosphere of
aggressive demands.''
   The World Jewish Congress, which coordinated a campaign to move
the convent, called Cardinal Franciszek Macharski's announcement
``a tragic blow'' and urged the Vatican to overturn it.
   A signer of the 1987 accord between Jewish leaders and Catholic
bishops said the statement was ``absolutely unacceptable.''
   Macharski, whose Krakow archdiocese includes the former
concentration camp and the convent in the southern city of
Oswiecim, said conditions ``make it impossible'' to carry out the
pact, which was signed in Geneva.
   Under the agreement, the nuns were to be moved to a prayer
center to be built several thousand yards away from the
concentration camp.
   Although not stating specifically that the relocation has been
canceled, it appeared from Macharski's statement, carried by
state-run PAP news agency, the project is blocked indefinitely.
   In Rome, Vatican Radio carried the statement without comment.
   Recent protests by Jewish groups at the convent, located since
1984 in a restored theater abutting the camp's barbed-wire fence,
have destroyed the atmosphere needed to create the new interfaith
prayer center, Macharski said.
   ``At the foundation of an act of peace, there must be the wish
for peace,'' he said.
   Jewish groups say the convent and its religious symbols,
including a 23-foot wooden cross, at the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex
are offensive. An estimated 2.5 million Jews were killed at the
camp during Adolf Hitler's drive to annihilate Jews in Europe.
   Macharski's statements ``constitute a tragic blow to all of us
in the Jewish and Catholic world who have worked so long to foster
mutual understanding and respect,'' the World Jewish Congress said
in a statement in Washington.
   ``Silence by the Vatican on this occasion would repeat a
historical tragedy,'' the statement said, referring to the
Vatican's alleged failure to prevent the World War II genocide of
European Jews.
   It is ``an absolutely unacceptable act to break an agreement
that he (Macharski) has failed to respect already as of February,''
said Dr. Ludwig Ehrlig, European director of B'nai Brith, who
signed the 1987 agreement.
   A nun who answered the convent's telephone Thursday said the
community knew nothing of Macharski's statement and the sisters
were not authorized to comment.
   Polish public opinion has been mainly against moving the
cloister. Poles, who are overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, argue that
tens of thousands of Catholics, including priests and nuns, were
put to death at the camp, and that the nuns should be allowed to
pray for them.
   Demonstrations outside the convent by visiting Jews intensified
this year after the church missed a promised February deadline for
moving the nuns.
   On July 14, seven American Jewish men climbed a fence and
occupied the convent grounds for several hours before being
forcibly evicted by Polish construction workers.
   ``Delays in keeping the unrealistic date of constructing the
center caused on the side of some Western Jewish communities a
violent campaign of accusations and slanders,'' Macharski said.
   ``The human and Christian dignity of the nuns was not respected.
The peace to which they are entitled was disturbed,'' the statement
said.
   ``Such attitudes and actions make it impossible for me to
continue further realization of the construction of the center. In
this atmosphere of aggressive demands...It is not possible to
together care for the construction of a place of mutual respect
without abandoning one's religious and national beliefs.''
   Work had never begun on the new center, although church
officials said they were buying land for it.

<HEAD>Powell Seen As Honest Broker Amid Tough Rivalries</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Joint Chiefs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, President Bush's choice
to ride herd on Pentagon rivalries as the next chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, will be an ``honest broker'' who will
present all sides to the man in the Oval Office, his associates
predicted Thursday.
   Powell, 52, is slated to take over from Adm. William Crowe on
Oct. 1 after what is widely expected to be an easy confirmation in
the Senate. He'll make history as the youngest officer and the
first black ever to hold the post.
   The four-star Army general will be the 12th man to hold the
position of top military adviser to the nation's commander-in-chief.
   Bush and Powell draw on a years-long relationship, honed inside
the White House when both served under President Reagan.
   Their shared easy-going style was evident during Thursday's Rose
Garden nomination ceremony, when reporters started to pop questions.
   ``Shall we go before they (reporters) start getting excited?''
Bush quipped to Powell, who chuckled as they turned toward the Oval
Office.
   While the general is known for a tough, business-like approach
and intellectual demeanor, he's also got a ready smile and keen
sense of humor.
   On one of President Reagan's annual Palm Springs vacation trips,
Powell joined White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater at the press
corps' traditional New Year's Eve family party _ even going so far
as to don a funny hat and toot on a noisemaker as midnight arrived.
   ``He can make fun of himself. He can be very funny, and not be
silly. But he never loses his dignity,'' said Dan Howard, the
former spokesman for the National Security Council who worked with
Powell at the White House.
   ``He was marvelous to work with, because he could deal with all
the internal conflicts'' that the national security adviser must
resolve for the president, said Howard, recently confirmed as
undersecretary of the Navy.
   ``Colin was an honest broker. ... He was very fair in presenting
others' viewpoints. That doesn't mean he didn't have one, because
he did. He was just very fair, and could present all sides without
putting a `spin' on it. That's a rare talent in this town,'' Howard
said.
   Such abilities will be essential when Powell is called upon to
deal with the Pentagon's intense interservice rivalries. Contests
among the services branches are widely expected to reach new highs
as the military budget shrinks and the assessment of the Soviet
threat diminishes.
   As well, Powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen
the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political
finesse with Congress are as essential as tough battlefield
instincts.
   ``The chairmanship's political now,'' observed one senior
Pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be identified.
``Powell's got great political adroitness. He'll get a great
reception on Capitol Hill, and he's got experience dealing with the
Soviets.''
   Powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the
Pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have
outweighed his military experience. But those who know him contend
that his mix of jobs, in command roles and political trenches of
Washington, will stand him in good stead.
   ``He's been head of the NSC. He's commanded troops in Europe.
He's dealt with the guard and reserve in his current post and he's
been at the elbow of the secretary of defense. He's had experiences
few can match,'' said Robert Sims, a former Pentagon spokesman who
knew Powell when he served as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's
military aide.
   ``He's had a lot of staff jobs because he's so good,'' Sims
said. ``He's an excellent choice _ and extraordinary leader and a
great human being.''
   Sims and Howard both agreed that Powell can be expected to keep
his political views to himself and take a pragmatic approach.
   ``He plays those things close to the vest. He cares intensely
about such things, but he's not driven by ideology,'' Howard said.
   The issue of race is one that has rarely been mentioned by
Powell, but his acquaintances say it is not the reason he was been
chosen.
   Powell has rarely spoken of race in public, but a speech at a
meeting last year of the Joint Center for Political Studies, a
black think tank in Washington, he recalled those who ``suffered
and sacrificed to create the conditions and set the stage for me.''
   ``And I am also mindful that the struggle (against racism) is
not over ... until every American is able to find his or her own
place in our society limited only by his or her own ability and his
or her own dream,'' he said.

   Two U.S. congressmen said Thursday their visit to
a prison camp in the Ural Mountains convinced them the Soviet Union
is still holding political prisoners.
   Reps. Frank Wolf, R-Va., and Christopher Smith, R-N.J., who
visited the Perm 35 labor camp on Wednesday and interviewed 24
prisoners, said they could not specify how many were being held for
their political beliefs.
   But Wolf said ``many or most said they were political
prisoners'' and ``we believe that they are.''
   The congressmen said inmates complained of the cold and
isolation, and were allowed few visits from relatives.
   ``They ought to close the camp down,'' Wolf said. ``It's a
terrible place and it ought not to exist.''
   Perm 35 is known for housing Soviet dissidents, including noted
human rights activist Natan Sharansky, who now lives in Israel.
   Smith said Tuesday that Perm 35 was ``notorious for ...
mistreatment, particularly of political prisoners.''
   Wolf and Smith said the camp clearly was spruced up for their
arrival, with fresh paint on many walls and flowers on cafeteria
tables.
   They also visited punishment cells where, they were told,
prisoners were kept with no bedding or warm clothes even in the
dead of winter.
   Former prisoners have said confinement at the camp, about 1,000
miles east of Moscow and 80 miles outside the industrial town of
Perm, included every-other-day rations of bread and gruel and new
punishments tacked onto their sentences.
   The congressmen, who are members of the Helsinki Commission,
said they would seek to have more delegations visit such camps to
assure that conditions were humane.
   Smith said he hoped that bringing ``glasnost to the Gulag,'' or
more openness to the prison camp system, would bring improvements
in camp life.
   Asked how he reconciled his findings with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's denials that the Soviet Union still has political
prisoners, Smith said, ``I believe Mr. Gorbachev may have been
misled by his own people.''
   Human rights groups estimate about 100 political prisoners
remain in the Soviet Union, according to a State Department
official accompanying the congressmen.
   ``We think Mr. Gorbachev will use his immense political power to
see these people are released,'' Smith said.
   Smith and Wolf said they and several human rights groups are
pushing Soviet authorities to review the cases of the prisoners
they met. Many were convicted of treason or for trying to illegally
leave the Soviet Union.
   The congressmen said they expected the Soviets ``to clean up
their own act'' before the Helsinki Conference on Human Rights
convenes in Moscow in 1991.
   The two men went to Perm on their own initiative after broaching
the idea to a senior Soviet justice official six months ago in the
Netherlands. They were granted approval one day before the trip to
Perm was scheduled and made the visit on Wednesday.
   They said this week that they received official permission after
meeting with Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin and the Soviet Union's
chief prosecutor, Alexander Sukharev.
   Smith said they ``wanted to expose some of the horror of a
prison camp.''
   On Tuesday, in a telephone call from Moscow to Washington, Smith
said, ``Frank Wolf and I and the first two congressmen to go the
the Perm camp.''

   A Soviet television crew filming in Israel for
the first time in more than 20 years on Thursday toured the
occupied West Bank with an army patrol.
   The Soviet crew, led by correspondent Yevgeny Kiselev, also is
to interview Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens and Finance Minister Shimon Peres before leaving.
   The Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with Israel as a
show of solidarity with Arab nations following the 1967 Middle East
war.
   The visit by the television crew is another sign of thawing
relations between the two nations. They have exchanged consular
delegations over the last two years and have stepped up cultural
visits and tourism.
   In an interview with Israel television on Thursday, Kiselev
said, ``the intefadeh (Palestinian uprising) is the main story for
any TV company working in Jerusalem. But I want to show life in
Israel as well.''
   At least 535 Palestinians and 38 Israelis have died in the
20-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Ninety-one Arabs have been killed by other
Arabs, allegedly because they collaborated with Israel.
   In his tour of the West Bank, Kiselev interviewed the military
governor of Nablus, Col. Shmuel Morgan, and later spoke to a
reserve soldier who emigrated from the Soviet Union nine years ago.
   Kiselev also visited an Israeli kibbutz, or communal farm, and
toured high technology industries.
   The series on Israel, to be broadcast on the Soviet news show
``Vremya,'' will also include a report on the progress of 61
victims of December's devastating Armenian earthquake who arrived
in Israel on June 27 for six weeks of medical treatment and
rehabilitation.

<UNK>New Antibiotic Combats Severe Cat-Scratch Disease</UNK>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical experts have developed an antibiotic to
combat severe cases of cat-scratch disease, caused when a cat with
infected claws scratches a person, doctors say.
   Cat-scratch disease normally is a localized infection of the
lymph glands that which goes away within a few weeks or months. But
about 12 percent of infected people experience prolonged illness,
which could result in damage to the liver or spleen, Dr. Clifford
W. Bogue and three colleagues wrote in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   In controlled tests with three severely infected children, Bogue
and three colleagues found that gentamicin sulfate, an antibiotic,
appeared to markedly improve their condition.
   ``These cases suggest that gentamicin may be efficacious in
shortening the course of cat-scratch disease,'' the authors wrote.
   The children, a 10-year-old and two 5-year-old girls, responded
to the antibiotic within 48 hours, the authors said. They noted no
recurrence of symptoms.
   The disease was first noted in 1931, but doctors for years
failed to associate the cause with cat scratches. By 1967, there
were more than 560 references to CSD in medical literature.
   Scientists and doctors over the past 22 years have related other
symptoms to the disease, including fever, abdominal pain, atypical
pneumonia and breast tumors.

   Five people accused of working to develop
anti-helicopter missiles for the Irish Republican Army were
indicted Thursday on federal charges of conspiring to violate
regulations on arms exports.
   Investigators say the five, including a computer scientist, were
working for the Provisional IRA, the guerilla wing of the
nationalist group fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   Following the arrests of three of the defendants in July, the
FBI seized radar and missile parts ``in various stages of
development or manufacture'' during raids in Massachusetts, New
Hampshire and Pennsylvania, according to FBI agent James F. Ahearn.
   The indictment listed 59 alleged violations of the federal Arms
Export Control Act. The list was compiled through FBI
investigations, interviews with the suspects and telephone taps.
   It charged that the five conspired to ``export illegally to the
Republic of Ireland defense articles and services, and related
technical data, components, parts and accessories.''
   The three arrested were electrical engineer Richard Clark
Johnson, Irishman Martin Peter Quigley, and electrical engineering
student Christina Leigh Reid.
   Johnson, in his parents' custody in Harwich, is charged with
developing for export ``remote control detonation systems to
facilitate a bombing campaign directed against military and
civilian targets in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.''
   Quigley and another Irishman, Peter Eamon Maguire, are accused
of collaborating with Johnson to develop and export the rocket
systems.
   Maguire remains at large and is believed to be in Ireland.
Quigley, who lived in Bethlehem, Pa., has been held without bail
since his arrest, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard
Stearns.
   Gerald Vincent Hoy, a computer scientist and Penn State lecturer
from Easton, Penn., allegedly worked with Quigley to ``develop,
test and export a missile and rocket system to be used against
British Army helicopters'' in Northern Ireland. A summons was
issued for him to surrender, Stearns said.
   Ms. Reid, from Sunnyvale, Calif., allegedly agreed to act as a
courier between Johnson, Quigley and Maguire. She is free on
$10,000 bail after a hearing last month in San Francisco and has
been ordered to appear in Boston on Aug. 22.

   Associated Press Writer=
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The deadly, daily rain of shells and
rockets that has made Beirut a wasteland of fear killed at least 22
people Thursday and wounded 140.
   Shells hit the hilltop residence of U.S. Ambassador John
McCarthy in Yarze, a Christian suburb, and the mansion of French
Ambassador Rene Ala in nearby Hazmieh, police reported. The Soviet
cultural center in Moslem west Beirut also was hit, police said.
   Police said the duels between Syrian gunners and the Christian
army units of Gen. Michel Aoun began at 11 a.m. The day's
casualties raised the toll to 571 dead and 1,462 wounded, by police
count, since the artillery war began March 8.
   A police spokesman said the Syrians shelled the shattered
presidential palace in the eastern Baabda suburb with 240mm mortars.
   The spokesman said the mortars were deployed in wooded mountains
southeast of the capital held by Syria's Druse militia allies. He
said no casualties were reported at the palace.
   Aoun's men, deployed in the 310-square-mile Christian-held
region north and east of Beirut, shelled Syrian army outposts and
Moslem residential districts, said the police spokesman, whose name
was withheld in keeping with regulations.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
mandate issued in 1976, a year after the beginning of Lebanon's
sectarian civil war, in which more than 150,000 people have been
killed. Aoun calls the Syrians an occupation force and has declared
a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out.
   Most of the shells fired by the Christians fell on Moslem west
Beirut, the predominantly Shiite Moslem southern slums, the
southeastern mountains and the central Bekaa Valley, where the main
Syrian supply lines run.
   Syrian gunners ``retaliated fiercely'' to shelling of their
supply lines by firing on Christian districts from 32 howitzer and
mortar emplacements on the enclave's southern and eastern flanks,
the police spokesman said.
   He said the Syrians also used truck-mounted rocket launchers
that spit 40 rockets from multiple barrels in less than a minute.
   Lebanese reporter Bahjat Jaber said rocket salvos hit the
Christian-held coast north of Beirut and nearby wooded mountains,
starting several fires.
   ``Hundreds of rockets are exploding in the sea, along the sand
beach and on the slopes,'' Jaber reported by telephone from
Jounieh, a port 12 miles north of Beirut.
   Beirut was a cacophony of shell exlosions, whooshing rockets and
ambulance sirens for much of the day, with the Christians and
Syrians trading fire at 40 rounds a minute.
   Police said Syrians and Christians also fought with machine
guns, rocket-propelled grenades and recoilless cannons across
Beirut's sectarian dividing line and on a front between Druse and
Christian mountain towns southeast of the city.
   Fighting on the dividing line closed the museum crossing, the
only gateway between Christian east Beirut and the Moslem western
sector, the police spokesman said.
   Rooftop snipers raked both sides of the line, trying to block
evacuation of casualties.
   Moslem and Christian radio stations interrupted regular
programming with reports of the fighting, and advised civilians to
seek cover.
   Motorists, pedestrians and shoppers deserted west Beirut's Hamra
commercial thoroughfare. Women carrying bags stuffed with
vegetables, bread and bottled water ran for shelter across the
avenue.
   ``I shouldn't have left home in the first place,'' a woman said
as she dashed into the entrance of a residential building near the
damaged Commodore Hotel, now a Syrian army outpost.
   ``Do you have a bomb shelter?'' she asked the janitor. ``Yes,''
he replied, but the woman left after seeing a helmeted Syrian
soldier standing guard at the hotel.
   ``She realized that we might get shelled because the Syrians are
our neighbors,'' the janitor said.

   The Bush administration said Thursday there
might eventually be direct U.S.-Iran talks on the Middle East
hostages, while officials encouraged an intermediary's role by
Pakistan in the meantime.
   ``We're willing to have direct talks with Iran, as long as they
were authoritative officials who represented the government,'' said
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater suggested it was premature to expect such contacts at
this point. ``We're nowhere near that,'' he said.
   Still, the spokesman said, ``We would not be ruling out direct
discussions at some future point.''
   The United States severed diplomatic ties with Tehran in the
aftermath of Iran's seizing of U.S. Embassy hostages a decade ago.
   Meanwhile Thursday, U.S. officials welcomed reports that
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan would go to Tehran
next week and be willing to serve as an intermediary in indirect
talks between this nation and Iran.
   A senior administration official said Pakistan's role could be
critical in persuading Iran to pressure pro-Iranian groups into
releasing kidnapped Americans and Westerners held in Lebanon.
   ``Pakistan is a Moslem country with access and ties to other
Moslem countries, and with special knowledge of Iran's
involvement'' in the hostage situation, said the official, who
declined to be identified.
   A spokesman at the Pakistan Embassy said that ``Since Pakistan
has good relations with both Iran and the United States, if asked
Pakistan would be willing to mediate in the hostage crisis.'' The
spokesman, who said he could not be identified under his
government's rules, added he was unable to confirm or deny whether
Pakistan has already been an intermediary between Iran and the
United States.
   The English-language Tehran Times said in a report on Thursday
that indirect talks between Iran and the United States on the
hostage crisis would be undertaken through a third country,
probably Pakistan.
   Fitzwater observed that some third-country discussions already
had taken place but added: ``We are encouraging talks of every
kind.''
   He said Khan and other Pakistani officials ``do have contacts in
Iran'' and it was the administration's policy ``to leave no stone
unturned'' in seeking to win freedom of the U.S. hostages.
   Of Khan's trip, Fitzwater said he could not supply details.
``There's a lot of unknowns regarding his trip and his purposes.''
   Khan made an unexpected visit to Washington last week, where he
met on the hostage situation with Vice President Dan Quayle,
according to Quayle spokesman David Beckwith.
   ``Vice President Quayle urged Pakistan to become involved in
helping facilitate the release of the hostages and to reveal to
Iran information that Pakistan has accumulated on the situation.''
   ``Pakistan is one of the countries that we're looking to for
help,'' Beckwith added.
   The Tehran Times said that indirect talks between Iran and the
United States on the hostages would begin within days, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted the paper as saying,
``Political observers believed that in the next few days we should
expect certain moves towards mediation, of course unofficially.''
   At the State Department, Margaret Tutwiler noted that ``we
already have indirect communications with the government of Iran,''
primarily through the Swiss government.
   On the possibility of direct contact, she said: ``The U.S.
government is prepared to engage in a dialogue with authorized
representatives of the government of Iran to discuss the issues
that divide us.''
   ``However, any improvement in relations with Iran depends upon
that government's stopping its support for terrorism and taking
action to bring about the immediate, unconditional and safe release
of U.S. citizens held hostage by Iranian-supported groups in
Lebanon,'' she added.
   Both Fitzwater and Ms. Tutwiler said that a willingness to talk
directly with Iran on issues dividing the two nations was not a new
U.S. policy.
   For direct talks to take place, he said, ``we would want to be
sure of the authoritative nature of our contacts. We would want to
have some clear understanding of what we wanted to say to them and
of their interest in having those discussions.''
   ``I have not heard any interest from Iran in having direct
talks, and that is a major factor as well,'' Fitzwater added.
   Bush himself made no comment on the hostage matter, passing up
an opportunity to discuss the situation during an appearance in the
Rose Garden where he announced the selection of Army Gen. Colin
Powell as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater told reporters the United States and Israel
were consulting with each other about efforts to free their
hostages in Lebanon, but were not coordinating their efforts.
   Israeli officials had said Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir persuaded Bush in a 10-minute telephone call Wednesday to
coordinate efforts to release foreign hostages and Israeli
prisoners held in Lebanon.
   ``We've generally tried to be forthcoming with what we are
doing, and they have been forthcoming with what they're doing.
However, I would not characterize it as coordination,'' Fitzwater
said.

   U.S. Marines stormed ashore and a
mechanized infantry battalion rumbled across the Panama Canal on
Thursday in a security exercise one day after a standoff between
U.S. and Panamanian forces.
   The exercise was the latest U.S. show of force in and around
Fort Amador, a base for both U.S. and Panamanian forces and site of
an office maintained by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``The operation was designed to carry out certain functions in
keeping with the mission of the U.S. defense forces and the
protection of the Panama Canal, particularly testing troop
readiness and deployment capability,'' said Col. Ronald Sconyers,
reading a U.S. Southern Command news release.
   ``The purpose was also to reaffirm our treaty rights, including
the right of transit.''
   U.S. officials have said they plan to vigorously enforce canal
treaty rights, including responsibility for canal security.
Officials hope to show Panamanians, especially military officers
who might oust Noriega, how helpless the general is in the face of
U.S. power.
   Noriega, de facto leader of Panama through his command of the
Panamanian Defense Forces, has successfully resisted all U.S.
attempts to oust him since he was indicted on U.S. drug trafficking
charges in February 1988.
   Noriega denies the charges and says the U.S. efforts to remove
him are part of an effort to retain control of the canal, which the
United States has pledged to give to Panama at the end of 1999.
   U.S. troops arrested but later released 29 Panamanians on
Tuesday. The next day, Panamanians arrested two U.S. military
policemen, leading to a three-hour U.S. blockade at Fort Amador
before the two were released.
   Transport ships, armored personnel carriers and light amphibious
vehicles took part in Thursday's exercise, with helicopters and
fighter-bombers providing cover.
   A small group of Panamanian soldiers stationed themselves about
100 yards from the Marine landing and small Panamanian helicopters
briefly flew overhead. Two Panamanian military trucks were blocked
for 10 minutes, without further incident.
   ``We are ensuring the security of the Fort Amador area, in
accordance with our treaty rights,'' said Sconyers.
   He refused to say how many troops were involved, but reporters
could see at least 800 soldiers and Marines, 50 troop carriers,
four seaplanes, landing craft and helicopters. The troops took up
combat positions in the grass around Fort Amador.
   The exercises began when a battalion of the mechanized 5th
Infantry Division left its base on the western side of the canal
and crossed a bridge to Fort Amador, while a light infantry company
of Marines landed at the end of the Amador Causeway south of the
fort.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces were told Thursday morning of the
U.S. plans. They held exercises a few miles away.
   In Caracas, Venezuela, Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, the former
chief of staff of the Panamanian Defense Forces, said on Thursday
that Noriega was seeking a bloody clash with U.S. units in Panama
as a desperate move to regain military strength and remain in full
command of his country.
   Diaz Herrera, who has lived in Venezuelan exile since 1987,
said, ``Noriega is like a cornered tiger striking blindly with its
paws. He needs a massacre of Panamanian soldiers to arouse morale
among his troops and present Panama as a victim.''
   Diaz Herrera's charges that Noriega was deeply involved in drug
trafficking and that presidential elections were rigged to favor
the official candidates helped set off the continuing political
turmoil in Panama.

<HEAD>Dismissal of FBI Agent's Claims Upheld on Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An FBI agent who said he was defamed by a book
describing the violence and killing of two other agents during the
Wounded Knee occupation in South Dakota is not entitled to damages,
an appellate court has ruled.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Monday upheld a lower court's dismissal of claims by David Price,
an FBI special agent assigned to the Pine Ridge reservation during
the early 1970s.
   Price filed a $25 million lawsuit against Peter Matthiessen,
author of ``In the Spirit of Crazy Horse,'' and the book's
publisher, Viking Penguin Inc. The company suspended circulation of
the book pending the suit's outcome.
   The book dealt with a 1975 shootout at Pine Ridge reservation at
Wounded Knee that left two FBI agents dead and got American Indian
Movement activist Leonard Peltier two life prison terms.
   Price claimed the book accused him of becoming involved in
perjury by a witness, misconduct, gross negligence in the murder of
a woman thought to have been an FBI informant and withholding
information.
   The book presents the view of the AIM that it was targeted for
harrassment by the FBI. Matthiessen reviews the group's occupation
of Wounded Knee in 1973 and subsequent prosecutions of AIM leaders
Dennis Banks and Russell Means.
   According to the book, Price supervised Louis Moves Camp, a
witness at their trial whose testimoney was later discredited.
   ``Fairly or not, Price had come to personify the most cynical
abuses of the FBI's regressive attitudes toward Indians,'' the
author wrote in one passage referring to his interviewing the FBI
agent.
   The lawsuit accused the defendants of defamation, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and other
violations of his rights.
   Successive U.S. District Court rulings narrowed the suit's scope
to the defamation claims. Nearly four years after Price first filed
his suit and after the defendants incurred legal costs exceeding $1
million, the lower court dismissed remaining claims.
   In its response on Monday to Price's appeal, the 8th Circuit
Court acknowledged its ruling was ``an anomaly'' in a time when
court cases focus increasingly on whether there is injury. The
court said also that it searched diligently for fault and ignored
some injury to the appellant.
   ``But there is a larger injury to be considered,'' the court
wrote, ``the damage done to every American when a book is pulled
from a shelf, as in this case, or when an idea is not circulated.''
   The court noted that while Price was praised for his work at
Wounded Knee, he also became involved in public controversies. His
complaint, the court said, took statements from their setting in a
way that ``distorts the flavor'' of the book.
   ``In its entirety, `Crazy Horse' focuses more on public
institutions and social forces than it does on any public
official,'' the opinion said.
   ``The sentiments it expresses are debatable. We favor letting
the debate continue.''

   A teen-age baseball pitcher who was shot in
the head by her coach improved to serious condition Thursday, but
detectives seeking a motive for the attack said they won't question
her until at least the weekend.
   The bizarre shooting, witnessed by motorists and at least one
law enforcement officer, occurred during rush hour Tuesday on busy
Interstate 80, about 15 miles northeast of Sacramento. Moments
later, the coach shot himself to death.
   Susanna Jacobs, a star pitcher in the suburban North Highlands
league, leaped from the moving pickup driven by her coach, Jesse
Aguilar, 42, while the vehicle traveled at 55 mph in the slow
eastbound lane. The girl bruised and battered herself while falling.
   Aguilar parked his truck on the shoulder of the freeway, walked
back to the injured girl and shot her once in the back of the head
with a revolver, according to motorists who stopped to help the
girl. He then turned the gun on himself.
   The girl's father, Roger Jacobs, said Aguilar had been following
his daughter in recent days and that he appeetween the two, he added.
   ``He never showed any signs of being a wacko,'' Jacobs said.
   Investigators said she confided to a close friend shortly before
the shooting that Aguilar had been following her around for about
two weeks.
   A spokeswoman at the University Medical Center said the
youngster's condition had improved Thursday to serious from
critical, following successful surgery to remove the bullet. She
reportedly was conscious and apparently aware of her surroundings,
but she was unable to respond to questioning, authorities said.
   A spokeswoman for Placer County Sheriff Don Nunes said
detectives would not attempt to question the teen-ager until
Saturday at the earliest.
   Placer County Sheriff's Detective Bill Summers said the girl and
Aguilar had argued frequently about baseball, but that
investigators were not yet aware of any deeper dispute between the
two.
   Jacobs said he believed Aguilar, a telephone company employee,
was jealous of his daughter's recent friendship with an 18-year-old
girl.
   Acquaintances described Aguilar as intense and competitive, and
said he had often volunteered to coach youth teams in baseball and
basketball.
   Miss Jacobs had played for Aguilar for years. In 1985, as a star
pitcher on an all-male team in the North Highlands Little League,
the girl gained citywide recognition of her athletic ability.
   She continued to play for Aguilar as she moved up from Little
League to the North Highlands Big League.

<TEXT>
   The president of the Afghan guerrilla
government called his foreign minister a ``killer'' Thursday and
said the movement would be better off without him.
   Speculation arose that a moderate guerrilla commander who died
of poisoning this week was killed by rivals. The dead man's son
blamed agents of Afghanistan's Marxist government, which Moslem
insurgents have fought since a communist coup in 1978.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, president of the guerrilla
government-in-exile, said it would have a better chance of
surviving without Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who serves as foreign
minister. Hekmatyar leads the Hezb-i-Islami, a powerful
fundamentalist faction.
   ``He considers himself the hero of the jihad (holy war), but in
fact he's a killer,'' Mojaddidi said in an interview. ``He has
killed hundreds of mujahedeen inside Afghanistan and hundreds of
innocent people inside Afghanistan.''
   The guerrillas are known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors. Those
under Hekmatyar's command are accused of killing 32 rebels of the
rival Jamiat-i-Islami group July 9 in northern Afghanistan.
   Hekmatyar admitted his men's involvement, but said they were
provoked. Jamiat leader Burhanuddin Rabbani has demanded Hekmatyar
be suspended from the guerrilla government.
   Such infighting threatens what little unity exists among the
guerrilla factions.
   Mojaddidi said of Hekmatyar: ``This man is destroying
Afghanistan.'' The president's Afghan National Liberation Front is
seen as more moderate than the factions of Hekmatyar and Rabbani.
   Asked whether the rebel government would be better off without
Hekmatyar, Mojaddidi replied: ``Why not?''
   Hekmatyar was not available for comment. His chief political
officer, Abdul Qadir Karyab, said of Mojaddidi, ``We think this man
is mad.''
   The moderate commander who died of poison was 75-year-old Haji
Abdul Latif, known as the Lion of Kandahar, who had clashed with
Hekmatyar and other fundamentalists.
   A letter from his son, Sher Agha, said Latif writhed in pain for
20 hours before dying Monday outside the arid southern city of
Arghastan, about 50 miles east of Kandahar, a guerrilla source
reported.
   Two of the commander's bodyguards confessed, saying the Afghan
government was behind the poisoning, and were put to death, the
source reported.
   Some rebel sources within and apart from Latif's National
Islamic Front of Afghanistan blamed factional rivalry, but would
not elaborate.
   ``How can we say who did it until we finish our investigation?''
asked Nasser-Zia, a spokesman for Latif's faction. Hamid Gailani,
another spokesman for the group, said ``it could be anyone,
including the government.''
   Agha's letter quoted the bodyguards, Mohammad Nadir and Mohammad
Zahir, as saying they were paid about $5,700 by the Afghan secret
service, known as the Khad, the source said.
   A dozen of Latif's men were slain one night last year after a
Khad agent who had infiltrated their ranks took government soldiers
to their hideout, he quoted the letter as saying.
   Latif had several disputes with fundamentalist factions,
particularly Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami.
   Earlier this year, he claimed to have made a machine-gun attack
on a convoy led by Hekmatyar. He boasted of having driven Hekmatyar
from the Kandahar region, where Hezb-i-Islami was trying to
mobilize guerrilas for an attack on the city.
   Guerrillas in Latif's and other moderate factions have opposed
attempts to attack Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city,
where many of their families live.

<HEAD>Winged Rocket For Low Orbit Satellite Insertion Rolled Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A winged rocket built to
be launched from under the wing of an airplane and carry small
satellites into orbit at low cost was shown off Thursday in advance
of a flight test program.
   The gleaming white, 49-foot-long Pegasus, named after the
mythological winged horse, was rolled out of a hangar at NASA's
Ames-Dryden Flight Research Facility as 400 guests watched and a
high school band played.
   Pegasus ``will not only open up new horizons in low-cost,
innovative uses of space, but also confirms once more America's
leadership in space technology,'' said Antonio Elias, chief
engineer of the rocket project.
   Noting its adaptation of technology from military missiles,
Elias declared Pegasus ``a noteworthy example of swords turned into
plowshares.''
   The three-stage rocket was developed as a joint venture by
Orbital Sciences Corp. and Hercules Aerospace Co., which estimate
Pegasus rockets can put satellites into space at a cost of $6
million to $8 million per launch.
   The rocket that was rolled out for the ceremony will be carried
aloft under the wing of a NASA B-52 for test flights later this
month and in early October, but won't be launched.
   Later in October, another Pegasus will be released from a B-52
about 40,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean off the California coast.
The builders plan to buy or lease planes to launch future rockets.
   Bob Lovell, vice president of the Space Applications Division at
Orbital Sciences, said the company is certain there is a market for
the rocket.
   ``We believe that we'll be launching one of these a month
beginning in about 1991, and ultimately we hope to go as high as
two a month. That market, we think, will be split roughly equally
between Department of Defense missions and commercial missions,''
he said.
   The military is interested because of the ability to launch
Pegasus quickly in reacting to such events as the Grenada invasion,
said Air Force Lt. Col. Ed Nicastri, from the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.
   ``If we wanted to get more communications into that area, we
could quickly launch communications satellites,'' Nicastri said. A
conventional launch would take about 30 days' notice, he said.
   Launch costs for military payloads average $120 million on a
space shuttle, about $100 million for a Titan launch, and some $40
million for a Delta-class launch, Nicastri said.
   However, space shuttles, Titans and Deltas can carry much bigger
and heavier payloads than the Pegasus.
   The companies announced in June that their first commercial
customer is Ball Corp. Under an agreement, Pegasus rockets will be
used to launch two Ball communications satellites in 1990 or 1991.
   The NASA B-52 will be used for the flight tests, but the
builders will lease or buy planes to launch future rockets for
other clients.

<HEAD>Judge Indicts Three In Slaying of Unionist Working to Preserve Amazon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge in a backwoods Amazon town
said Thursday that he indicted a cattle rancher, his son and
another man for the slaying of Amazon union leader and
environmentalist Chico Mendes.
   Judge Adair Jose Longuini of the jungle town of Xapuri, 2,660
miles northwest of Rio, said he indicted Darli Alves da Silva for
ordering the Dec. 22, 1988 killing of Mendes.
   Silva's son Darcy Pereira da Silva and gunman Jerdeir Pereira
were indicted for carrying out the slaying, Longuini said.
   Mendes' death caused an international outcry from human rights
and environmental groups along with demands for the capture and
prosecution of his killers.
   He was just one of hundreds of union leaders and environmentists
killed in disputes over land and development in the Amazon
rainforest, but most of the cases have never been tried.
   The indictments, issued Wednesday, were sent to the state court
in Rio Branco, the capital of Acre state, he said.
   Under Brazilian law, a judge can indict someone who is accused
of a crime and the court later upholds or dismisses the ruling.
   ``The court should rule on my findings within 90 days. If they
confirm the indictments the trial will be held in Xapuri,'' he said.
   Longuini said both members of the da Silva family were jailed in
Rio Branco. Police are still looking for Jerdeir Pereira.
   The elder da Silva has denied any role in the shooting. His son
earlier said he was involved, but has since said he had no role.
   Mendes, 44, headed a local rubber tappers union in Xapuri, a
small Amazon town near the Bolivian border. Union members often
blocked ranchers' efforts to clear rainforest by standing in front
of bulldozers with family and community members.
   In 1987 Mendes received the United Nations Global 500 ecological
award for his work in defense of the Amazon.
   The issue of how to develop the Amazon jungle, an expanse of
rain forest about two-thirds the size of the continental United
States, has often erupted in bloody clashes between landowners and
politicians on one side and peasant farmers, progressive clergymen
and ecologists on the other.

<TEXT>
   The man accused of the fatal shooting of
actress Rebecca Schaeffer was hustled out of Arizona by Los Angeles
authorities Thursday after his public defender filed the wrong
motion in the wrong court.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner said his office seized the chance
to ``snatch'' Robert John Bardo, 19, from Tucson after realizing
that Bardo's defense lawyer had challenged to his extradition in
the wrong court.
   Lori Lefferts, a Pima County deputy public defender appointed to
represent Bardo in extradition proceedings, said his transfer to
Los Angeles was ``totally in violation of his rights. He had an
absolute right to a hearing and he never got that hearing.''
   However, she said: ``I have absolutely no remedy. It's all over
for here.''
   She said she did not learn about the action until two hours
after he left on a plane to Los Angeles.
   The public defender apparently thought she had eight days to
challenge extradition, but Reiner said: ``She didn't have eight
minutes.''
   ``This is not a game,'' Reiner said at a news conference. ``This
is murder, and if we are able to move into Tucson and snatch him,
we are going to do that.''
   ``Because of a momentary lapse by his lawyer, we were able to
avoid the lengthy and, in this case, unnecessary delays of an
extradition proceeding,'' he said.
   A governor's warrant was served on Bardo on Monday. A defense
attorney can file petition for a writ of habeas corpus to fight the
warrant.
   But instead of filing for a writ, which would have automatically
held Bardo until a hearing could be held, Ms. Lefferts filed a
motion to stay the proceeding pending a mental health examination,
and filed it in Justice Court instead of Superior Court.
   ``The judge denied her motion, he refused to put a stay on the
extradition. And so Los Angeles was advised that they could pick
Bardo up,'' said Ricki Macey, head of the fugitive warrant unit in
the Pima County Attorney's office.
   Ms. Lefferts still could have filed a petition for a writ in
Superior Court, but in the meantime, two police investigators
hurried to reach Tucson Wednesday before the court clerk's office
closed at midnight.
   Their flight was delayed four times. But with an escort by
Tuscon police officers, they made it in time to complete paperwork,
take custody of Bardo and fly him back to Los Angeles on a 6 a.m.
flight.
   Reiner said the quick move averted a protracted legal battle
over Bardo's mental competency.
   Miss Schaeffer, 21, who had costarred in the television series
``My Sister Sam,'' was shot to death in Los Angeles on July 18.
   Bardo was arrested the next day in Tucson after he ran in and
out of traffic on Interstate 10 near a downtown exit.
   Detectives said statements by Bardo prompted them to notify Los
Angeles authorities investigating Miss Schaeffer's death.
   Bardo, who lived at his parents' Tucson home, collected
videotapes of the series, once was thrown out of a TV studio where
Miss Schaeffer was working, sent her a rambling love letter and had
hired a detective agency to find her address, officials have said.
   Bardo had been held in lieu of $1 million bond in the Pima
County Jail's mental health unit and had been under a suicide watch.
   Ms. Lefferts declined to say if Bardo has undergone psychiatric
evaluation.
   Bardo was scheduled to be arraigned on the murder charge in Los
Angeles on Friday.

Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Crews searching for the plane
carrying U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland and 13 companions were told a U.S.
weather satellite picked up two emergency signals, one on Thursday
and one early Friday.
   The satellite was passing directly over Ethiopia when it picked
up the second signal, far away from the first signal picked up
Thursday but still boosting confidence that it came from the
missing plane.
   The satellite read the second signal as coming at 1 a.m. Friday
(6 p.m. EDT Thursday) from about 100 miles north-northwest of Addis
Ababa, capital of Ethiopia. When the Texas Democrat's plane
vanished Monday, it was supposed to be going southwest, directly
opposite from where the new signal was detected.
   ``We have greater confidence in this particular signal because
the satellite was in a better position to make a location,'' said
Russell Koffler of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration
in Washington.
   The second signal was picked up on a different wavelength from
the earlier one, but Koffler said the missing plane could broadcast
on both wavelengths.
   ``We are confident we got a good fix. We have more confidence in
this signal than in the one last night,'' said Koffler.
   Officials believe the first signal came from 84 miles southeast
of Addis Ababa. Both signals were far from the flight path Leland's
plane would have taken to reach Fugnido refugee camp for which
Leland, chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, was
headed.
   The camp lies 480 miles southwest of Addis Ababa and near the
Sudanese border.
   Koffler said the second signal ``doesn't mean it's from that
particular plane,'' but noted there would be few such sources for
distress signals in Ethiopia.
   The first signal was picked up when the satellite passed over
the edge of Ethiopia's border and search teams set out on foot for
that remote mountain area.
   Both signals were relayed from the satellite to a ground station
in India.
   Leland took off Monday morning with eight Americans and five
Ethiopians for the Fugnido camp.
   The twin-engine Twin Otter aircraft was reported missing Monday
evening.
   The satellite picked up the first faint distress signal at 3:42
a.m. Thursday (8:42 p.m. EDT Wednesday).
   ``It could have been another plane flying over the area and the
pilot fingered his microphone and the satellite picked up the
blip,'' observed Robert Houdek, charge d'affairs at the U.S.
Embassy in Addis Ababa.
   James T. Baily, manager of the administration's search and
rescue satellite program, said subsequent satellite passes could
not confirm the signal because of radio interference.
   Leland's plane was equipped with an emergency locator
transmitter, a device usually mounted in the tail of an aircraft
and activated either automatically by impact or manually.
   Two U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules cargo planes arrived Thursday
and spent three hours flying over the path Leland's plane was
supposed to have taken.
   A U-2 aircraft also joined the search. U-2s are capable of
taking high-resolution photographs over a broad area and were once
commonly used for espionage missions.
   Four U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopters were expected to arrive
Friday.
   Four Ethiopian Air Force helicopters were also added, joining
the U.S. fleet and more than a dozen light planes under the
direction of the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority.
   Since Monday, the search has centered on a high, mountainous
plateau near the Sudanese border, not far from the Fugnido camp.
   There were reports on Monday that peasants heard a light plane
circling one or two dirt landing strips in an area 50 miles from
Leland's destination.
   ``The feeling is that the reports that we heard of a plane being
heard in that area mean that the pilot may have made a successful
emergency landing,'' said John Guerra of the U.S. Embassy.
   ``The possibility is that the congressman's plane got past the
most treacherous terrain and they're just sitting someplace waiting
to be found.'' He said the group had some water and food, but not
much. In addition, temperatures in the area can drop to freezing at
night.
   On board besides Leland were three members of his staff; a
friend; four Americans from the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Agency
for International Development; and five Ethiopians, including three
government officials, the pilot and co-pilot.
   Two congressional colleagues, Reps. Gary Ackerman and Alan
Wheat, flew to Addis Ababa to take part in the search.

<HEAD>Soviet Farmers to Get Hard Currency for Surplus Grain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet farmers will soon be able to cash in on
their cash crops under a new decree that allows them to sell
surplus grain and seeds for hard currency, the official Tass news
agency reported Thursday.
   The resolution says farmers can sell part of their high-quality
wheat, peas, lupine and oil-bearing seeds to the government for
convertible currency that can be used to buy hard-to-get foreign
goods.
   The reasoning is that the chance to earn hard currency will
stimulate so much extra production that the state will end up
paying its own farmers less than it would have paid for imports to
make up chronic shortages, Tass said.
   Tass said the new system will be introduced on a test basis in
1989-90.
   Economist Nikolai Shemelev suggested at the Congress of People's
Deputies in June that the Soviet Union adopt such a system.
   Tass said the state will pay $96 in hard currency per ton of
strong and durum wheat; $64 per ton of other high-quality wheat;
$128 per ton of pea and lupine, and $144 per ton of sunflower, soy,
rape, flax and mustard seed.
   ``The farms will be free in spending the currency,'' Tass said.
   Soviet citizens' access to foreign currency is normally very
restricted, but restrictions have begun to loosen slightly as more
Soviet firms are allowed access to foreign markets under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   The ability to buy foreign goods takes on added significance in
the face of shortages of such basics as soap, detergent and
medicine due to economic dislocation brought on by reforms.
   The government will also look into the possibility of allowing
individual farmers with private plots and those who lease their
land to sell for hard currency as well, Tass said.
   Its report said the new resolution was passed in accordance with
a decision of the Congress of People's Deputies.

<TEXT>
   East Germany has pledged not to punish
hundreds of its citizens who have gone underground in Hungary or
are seeking asylum on West German diplomatic property, Hungarian
officials said Thursday.
   The Interior Ministry officials also said Hungary was examining
about 10 petitions for political asylum, but that none of them were
from East Germans.
   ``We have been authorized to announce (by East Germany) ... that
those East German citizens now at the West German Embassy, as well
as those East German citizens residing here illegally will not be
subject to punitive measures if they return to East Germany within
a short time,'' said Police Col. Karoly Nagy told reporters. ``They
can (then) submit their emigration petitions.''
   A West German Embassy official said he believed the East German
offer was good only for those in Hungary.
   Those in the East Berlin mission had been promised freedom from
prosecution but not permission to submit emigration requests, he
said. The West German, who attended the news conference, asked that
he not be named.
   East Germans began occupying West German diplomatic legations in
Eastern Europe nearly two weeks ago, apparently out of frustration
over the lack of reform in their communist country and the
difficulty of emigrating through official channels.
   As many as 400 are reported holed up in embassies and consulates
in Budapest and Prague, and at the permanent mission in East
Berlin. An undetermined number is said to have gone underground in
Hungary, fearing persecution if they return because of their escape
attempts.
   East German media said Thursday that 158 East Germans were on
West German diplomatic property in Hungary.
   Hungarian officials speaking privately have conceded that the
standoff is leading to tensions with Warsaw Pact ally East Germany,
which has attacked reforms under way in Hungary.
   Hungary is the only Soviet bloc nation to have joined the U.N.
Convention on the rights of refugees, and Nagy said the petititons
of the approximately 10 asylum-seekers were being examined in the
spirit of the convention, although new Hungarian refugee laws were
not yet complete.
   Hungary first joined the convention stipulating the right to
asylum for those persecuted because of race, religion, nationality
or political beliefs in March.
   In a statement distributed at the news conference, the Interior
Ministry said that despite Hungary's acceptance of the convention
``our nation does not wish to become an exiting channel ... for
east European citizens.''
   The officials acknowledged that ethnic Hungarians and Romanians
who flee to Hungary are being permitted to stay without
formalities, although a similar bilateral agreement exists with
Bucharest. They said such unequal treatment will end by October,
when each case will be examined on its merits, regardless of the
applicant's citizenship.
   Formally Soviet bloc allies, Romania and Hungary are deeply
split over territorial and ethnic disagreements.

<TEXT>
   Former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos
pleaded Thursday to leave the United States, but promised to return
to face prosecution on criminal racketeering charges ``if it is the
last thing I do.''
   ``Your honor, I would like to make a plea and a pledge. A plea
to bring President Marcos home to his motherland, the
Philippines,'' she said, sobbing.
   ``If it is the last thing I will do in my life, I will come back
to New York to vindicate ... our name, the name of the Marcoses,
for the truth will set us free,'' she told Chief U.S. Immigration
Judge William R. Robie.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is challenging a travel ban imposed in June by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service which bars her from
leaving the United States. Robie is expected to issue his ruling in
Washington in several weeks.
   Mrs. Marcos wants to take her dying husband, Ferdinand, the
former Philippine president, back to their homeland, but more than
the INS order is preventing their departure.
   The Marcoses were indicted by the United States last October for
allegedly stealing more than $100 million from the Philippines and
stashing it in the United States. Marcos was separated from the
case because of his failing health, but Mrs. Marcos pleaded
innocent and was released on $5 million bail.
   Her bail provisions require her to stay in the country, and
Marcos' attorney Richard Hibey said that makes the travel order
unnecessary.
   Besides, Hibey said, Philippine President Corazon Aquino has
forbidden Marcos' return, dead or alive, and the ban extends to his
family. The 71-year-old Marcos has been hospitalized here for the
past seven months and was listed in critical condition Thursday.
   Mrs. Marcos has repeatedly said she would like to bring her
husband home to die, and has appealed to Mrs. Aquino to allow her
wish.
   Hibey said he would ask a federal judge to expand Mrs. Marcos'
bail provisions to allow her to leave only if Marcos dies, Mrs.
Aquino relents and the INS order was lifted.
   ``I'm dealing with the legal realities, she's dealing with what
she really wants,'' Hibey said.
   The government contends the travel ban should stand because the
Marcoses are billionaires and the loss of $5 million would not
prevent Mrs. Marcos from fleeing; that they unsuccessfully plotted
to overthrow Mrs. Aquino; that their presence in the Philippines
would destabilize the government and that no extradition treaty
exists between the two countries to ensure Mrs. Marcos' return.
   Roy Hendricks, acting district director of the INS in Honolulu,
testified Thursday that he had no ``specific reason'' to believe
Mrs. Marcos would flee and that he issued the travel ban on orders
from Washington.

<HEAD>Ag Department Estimates Lower Soviet Grain Production</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department on Thursday
estimated Soviet grain production this year at 200 million metric
tons, 10 million below earlier forecasts, and said there would be a
resulting rise in imports.
   The department estimated grain imports by the Soviets in the
year that began July 1 at 36 million tons, 3 million above previous
estimates.
   Hot and dry weather across many of the spring wheat-growing
regions of the Soviet Union combined with a shrinkage in the
growing area are causing the drop, according to a report from the
Foreign Agriculture Service.
   It estimated wheat production down 4.5 million tons to 87
million, while coarse grains decreased by 5.5 million to 100
million.
   Over the last 14 years, Soviet grain production fell to its
lowest level, 140.1 million metric tons, in 1975 and climbed to its
high of 237.4 million in 1978. Grain production reached 211.4
million in 1987 and 195.1 million last year.
   This year, favorable conditions across much of the European
portion of the Soviet Union have failed to fully offset hot and dry
weather baking out soil moisture from the eastern Urals to western
Sibera, USDA said. It said cooler weather and showers in the last
week came too late to rescue spring grains.

<HEAD>Church Delegates Change Rule Governing Ministers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentecostal denomination that endured
the Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker scandals has rewritten its rules
of conduct for ministers to include sexual misconduct as a
punishable offense.
   The Assemblies of God said the more specific wording was part of
a rule revision that had been planned for six years. Delegates
approved the change Wednesday at the denomination's general council
meeting.
   Previously, any offenses involving sexual misconduct fell under
the general statement of ``any conduct unbecoming to a minister or
indiscretions involving morals.''
   Swaggart was expelled in 1988 for refusing to accept a one-year
suspension after his tearful confession of ``moral failure.'' He
had been accused of patronizing a prostitute.
   Bakker, founder of the PTL ministry, was stripped of his
credentials in 1987 after admitting a sexual encounter with church
secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Other causes for disciplinary action are ``dictatorial
authority'' over a congregation, inefficiency, a noncooperative
spirit, a habit of running into debt and the remarriage of a
divorced clergy member whose former spouse is still living.
   A credentials committee will decide whether a minister is
rehabilitated or dismissed for an offense, based on the manner and
thoroughness of repentance, the attitude of the minister toward the
discipline and willingness to cooperate.
   The only busines on the meeting's scheduled Thursday was
committee reports on Christian educating, dealing with the
restructuring of the denomination's division of Christian education.
   On Wednesday, the Rev. G. Raymond Carlson was re-elected to his
second four-year term as general superintendent, the denomination's
chief executive officer.
   The church has 1.3 million members and an attendance of roughly
twice that.

<HEAD>Allergies Predicted Higher In Northeast, Elsewhere</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parts of the South, Midwest and Northeast are
expected to have a worse hay fever season this year, beginning in
about two weeks, according to the American Academy of Allergy and
Immunology.
   A good growing season that began with a wet spring means New
York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey could experience the worst
increase in allergic reactions to the pollen of ragweed and other
plants, said Sarah Kaluzny, communications manager for the academy,
based in Milwaukee.
   Other states predicted to be bad this year are Montana, Alaska,
Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Indiana
and Kentucky, she said.
   Doctors from most of the 50 states responded to an unscientific
survey by the academy, and none indicated this year would see an
improvement over last year, Ms. Kaluzny said. No responses came
from Arkansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Illinios, Ohio, Utah,
New Hampshire, Massachusettes, Connecticut, Maryland, Florida,
North Carolina and Idaho.
   Ragweed is the major cause of allergies, with each plant
producing a million grains of pollen, Ms. Kaluzny said.
   Mold counts also are up in some areas of the nation because of
wet weather, contributing to the predicted increase in allergy
problems, she said.

<HEAD>Feud Between Militant Jewish Groups Results in Shooting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bicoastal feud between two militant Jewish
organizations erupted in violence in Greenwich Village on Thursday
when the head of one faction fired shots at the leader of another,
injuring a bystander.
   Mordechai Levy, head of the Jewish Defense Organization,
surrendered to police nearly 2{ hours after the shots were fired
following a dispute about court papers that were served in a libel
suit.
   Authorities said Levy would be charged with three counts of
attempted murder.
   The victim, Dominick Spinelli, was listed in stable condition at
St. Vincent's Hospital. He was sitting in a van on near Levy's
apartment when a shot came through the windshield and hit him in
the knee at about 12:25 p.m.
   Levy's apparent target was Irwin Rubin, the Los Angeles-based
head of the Jewish Defense League, who went with private
investigator Steve Rombom to Levy's Bleecker Street home to serve
him with papers in a libel action Rubin had filed.
   At issue were comments Levy made in an interview with a West
Coast radio station. The two groups _ the JDL and JDO _ have been
contentious for years, as Rubin and Levy battle over the mantle of
the JDL's founder, Meir Kahane.
   ``Levy left the JDL about 7 or 8 years ago. ... He formed his
own organization, the JDO, and they've been at odds with the JDL
since then,'' said Lt. David Nadel, a police liaison with the
Jewish community.
   ``Levy accused him (Rubin) of being a drug dealer and said
(Rubin's wife) attempted suicide,'' said Earl Krugel, chairman of
the JDL's Los Angeles Chapter. The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles
Superior Court on July 27.
   Police Chief Robert Johnston said Levy called police Wednesday
and said ``there were two people on their way to kill him.''
   Then, when Rubin and Rombom went to Bleecker Street on Thursday
afternoon, they threw stones at a window of Levy's second-floor
apartment.
   ``In the course of events, apparently someone came over the
roof, looked down and started firing a Ruger Mini-14 (semiautomatic
rifle) at them,'' Johnston said.
   The street was closed as dozens of police were brought in, along
with a robot used in hostage situations and a portable bulletproof
wall.
   Police managed to reach Levy _ a heavy, bearded man _ by phone
in his apartment. At 2:50 p.m., he surrendered quietly.
   People who said they were linked with the JDO have claimed
responsibility for numerous bombings and other acts of violence in
New York, though Levy always has said later that his group was not
involved.
   Levy legally owns seven guns. ``This guy's got heavy weaponry
... with the armament he's got, he's dangerous,'' Johnston said.
   As for the JDO, Johnston said, ``We've dealt with them. They're
not a very large organization, not anywhere near the size of the
JDL.''
   The Jewish Defense League was originally formed by Kahane to
mount armed response to anti-Semitic acts in New York City. It
gained notoriety when its members were linked to bombings, most of
them aimed at Soviet targets in retaliation for the way that
country treated its Jewish population.
   Kahane left the JDL and moved to Israel. A power struggle
ensued, with Rubin and Levy among the contenders its leadership.

<TEXT>
   Rescue teams searching along the San
Rafael River on Thursday found bodies as far as 14 miles downstream
from the site of a rail disaster that killed at least 112 people.
   The number of injured reached 205, the government news agency
quoted state security coordinator Jose Carlos Saracho as saying,
but hospital officials said most victims were treated for minor
injuries and released.
   Survivors said they fought for life after the 11-car train,
carrying about 360 people, plunged off a bridge at 4 a.m. Wednesday
morning and fell 25 feet into churning flood waters.
   ``I had my little girl. Since the car was full and the current
came we hit the roof and I could hear her drowning and you could
hear that the other people were drowning, too. We were drowning and
the windows were closed,'' said Miriam Partida Santos, 17.
   ``A pregnant woman grabbed me and that was when my girl got
away. I don't know how I escaped, at some point I got up to the top
and got air,'' said Mrs. Santos, who was in the Social Security
hospital in Guasave.
   She and other survivors said the train had been late departing
and passengers were told that another train had derailed along the
line to the north. Many passengers were asleep on the floor because
there were no seats.
   The federal Transportation Department said the train plunged off
the bridge following torrential rains. The train was bound from the
Pacific coastal resort of Mazatlan to Mexicali, on the California
border.
   A department statement said the area experienced its worst
rainstorm in the last 50 years just before the crash. It said two
inches of rain in six hours caused a dam to overflow, and the
resulting torrent washed out supports for the bridge, which
collapsed under the train's weight.
   ``Before I realized what happened, it had already crashed,''
said one train victim interviewed on television. His nose was
bandaged but he was otherwise unhurt.
   Hundreds of workers from nearby towns showed up to help, said
officials in Guasave, near the crash site 730 miles northwest of
Mexico City.
   Helicopters flew in rescue workers and railroad handcars
trundled out casualties. Flooding closed roads.
   The train, popularly known as ``The Burro'' because it stops at
almost every station along the 900-mile route, is patronized almost
entirely by poor Mexicans. It left Mazatlan at 7:45 p.m. Tuesday,
and had gone about 250 miles when the accident occurred at about 4
a.m. Police said they did not know how fast the train was going at
the time.
   Javier Lopez, the Red Cross duty officer in Los Mochis, 60 miles
northeast of the crash site, said most of those on the train had
apparently been sleeping and that most of the victims drowned.
   No Americans have been reported among the dead, said Dan Sainz,
the U.S. vice consul in Mazatlan, but he said bodies were still
being found.
   Mrs. Santos, who had been traveling back to her home in the
northern state of Sonora after visiting in-laws, said she had
spoken to a young American woman who was riding in her car. She
said she did not know the woman's fate.
   Most bodies were still unidentified. All those identified so far
were Mexicans.
   Passenger cars lay strewn across the track. Others lay on their
side in the river.
   Sinaloa state Gov. Francisco Labastida Ochoa said Thursday that
National Railroads was providing food, clothing, shelter and about
$200 each for survivors.
   Heavy rains have soaked the state for two weeks. Rain resumed
during the night and the search was suspended. But the skies
cleared Thursday morning and police, firefighters and Red Cross
workers returned to the site.
   Lt. Gabriela Herrera, a duty officer with Guasave police, said
about 20 bodies were in the town's three funeral parlors and the
rest were at Guamuchil and Los Mochis.
   At least three foreigners survived the wreck, said Teresita
Rubio at Turismo Tagore in Guasave. She said two men and a woman
from Manchester, England, came to the travel agency for help,
washed the mud off their clothes, got some food and headed for San
Diego by bus.
   Many reports referred to people missing, but many survivors
apparently simply walked away and left the area or went home.
   Accidents are frequent on the rundown Mexican railway, but this
was by far the worst this decade. A rail spokesman, like others
consulted, said it was not the worst in Mexican railroad history,
but could not list a more serious one.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Hit Atlantic Coast, Southwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the northeast Gulf
of Mexico across the northern Florida peninsula to the middle
Atlantic coast on Thursday, generating a tornado near Treasure
Island, Fla.
   In the West, persistent thunderstorms forced a debris-clogged
stretch of the Los Angeles Aqueduct to overflow, while flash
flooding prompted evacuations, stranded motorists and damaged
homes, crop land, and highways across a wide swath of Southern
California.
   Cold air that sent temperatures plummeting to record lows in
many cities combined with warm, moist air that also helped create
thunderstorms across upper and lower Michigan and the intermountain
region and the Rockies.
   More than a third of an inch fell in 20 minutes near Pocatello,
Idaho, while St. George, Utah, received more than half an inch of
rain in 40 minutes.
   On Treasure Island on Florida's Gulf Coast, the storms loosed a
tornado that caused minor damage to rooftops and cars.
   In Southern California, about 150 residents of Benton and nearby
Hammil and Chalfant valleys were evacuated because of flooding, and
at least 28 homes suffered moderate to severe water damage.
   A one-mile section of the Los Angeles Aqueduct that had been
closed because of previous flooding quickly filled with rain water
and overflowed, forcing a cleanup crew of 30 to evacuate, officials
said. The aqueduct supplies 75 percent of Los Angeles' water, but
reservoirs have enough water to prevent a shortage, officials said.
   More heavy rain threatened portions of Southern California.
Flash flood watches were posted for southeast California, southwest
Utah and parts of Nevada.
   In Yuma, Ariz., Gov. Rose Mofford inspected damage to about 500
to 1,000 homes flooded with up to four feet of water from a
Wednesday night storm that dumped 3.44 inches of rain in about two
hours.
   Light rain fell over Kansas and Oklahoma, and widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms were over northeastern South Dakota.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included .73 inches at Mayport, Fla., .52 inches at Richmond, Va.,
.27 inches at Homestead, Fla., and .21 inches at Alma, Ga.
   Much of the area from the Mississippi Valley to the Appalachians
had fair weather due to a large area of high pressure centered over
southeast New York State.
   Record low temperatures for Aug. 10 included 48 degrees in
Asheville, N.C., 63 in Fort Worth, Texas, 53 in Harrisburg, Pa., 54

   Seven frozen embryos at issue in an
unprecedented divorce trial should be in their mother's womb, ``in
their normal shelter, not in the fridge,'' a doctor testified
Thursday.
   Jerome Lejeune, director of research at the French National
Center of Scientific Research, testified in the divorce trial of
Junior Lewis Davis and Mary Sue Davis.
   The trial concluded Thursday after three days. Judge W. Dale
Young said he would rule sometime within 30 days.
   Davis sued for divorce in February, and raised an issue without
legal precedent in this country by asking the court to prevent any
use of the fertilized eggs without his consent. Mrs. Davis has had
five tubal pregnancies and wanted embryos, fertilized in a
laboratory, implanted directly in her womb.
   Lejeune, who discovered the genetic cause of Down's syndrome in
1959, said storing the embryos at 180 degrees below zero Centigrade
slows the movement of their molecules, in effect stopping the flow
of time for them.
   ``Putting tiny human beings in a very cold space, deprived of
liberty, deprived even of time, they are suspended as it were in a
concentration camp,'' he said. ``It is not as hospitable a place as
the secret temple of a woman's womb.''
   Lejeune said he traveled to Maryville at his own expense to
testify because he heard Mrs. Davis ``wanted to rescue these early
human beings from that concentration camp and offer then the
hospitality, the shelter of her body.''
   Davis testified Thursday he does not want the embryos destroyed,
only that he consent to their use. He has said the embryos should
be considered property to be administered jointly by him and Mrs.
Davis.
   Jay Christenberry, Mrs. Davis' attorney, said in closing
arguments that in the absence of legal precedent the judge should
look to the past.
   ``We have to look at history. When a mother wants to bear her
children she's never been told `no.' ... It seems to me a woman who
now has the right to abort her fetus should have an even greater
right to protect the unborn and bear her child or children.''
   In his closing argument, Charles Clifford, the attorney for
Junior Davis, said his client's right not to become a father is
equal to Mrs. Davis' right to become a mother.
   ``Whatever the court decides will cause pain,'' he said. ``But
if you weigh what is fundamentally fair, the court must come down
on the side of Junior Davis. If the court places the burden of
parenthood on him, he will live with it forever.''
   Clifford argued that Mrs. Davis has a reasonable chance of
becoming a mother even if she is not given control of the couple's
seven frozen embryos.
   The embryos had been fertilized for less than two days and
developed to less than eight cells each when they were frozen.
Earlier witnesses said the cells at that stage are identical, and
do not begin to take on differing characteristics for 12 to 14 days
after fertilization.
   Mrs. Davis testified Thursday she considers the embryos life.
``I am the mother of these embryos,'' she said. ``They are the
beginning of life. They are more than just cells that mean
nothing.''
   She said leaving the embryos in cold storage, as her estranged
husband proposes, ``would be killing them.''
   Davis testified that he does not consider the cells as life. He
said he opposes abortion, but notes these embryos are not inside
any woman's body.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa's bid for a government
coalition without the communist party gained ground Thursday as
Solidarity lawmakers discussed the proposal with the two small
parties that hold the balance of power in parliament.
   Competition between Solidarity and the communist Polish United
Workers Party for the support of the two smaller parties, which
each side needs to form a coalition, has produced a government
crisis once unimaginable in postwar Poland.
   In Italy, two visiting Solidarity leaders said reformist
communists could be allowed in a Solidarity-led government,
suggesting a possible way out of the impasse.
   ``The only government that can appear credible in the eyes of
the Polish people is an executive headed by Solidarity in coalition
with all the reformist forces in the country,'' including communist
reformers, Adam Michnik, one of Walesa's closest strategists, told
the Italian television network RAI Thursday.
   Solidarity parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek told RAI that
Solidarity felt forced by Poland's economic crisis _ especially
sharp increases in food prices Aug. 1 _ to accelerate its timetable
for entering into power.
   Michnik and Geremek, who were in Italy to be received by
Polish-born Pope John Paul II, said the key factor was for
Solidarity to head the next government.
   Aleksander Bentkowski, Peasant Party parliamentary leader, held
a hastily called meeting in Waraw with newly elected communist
Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, a government spokesman said. The
state news agency PAP gave no details in a report on the meeting.
   The Peasant Party ``took the decision to support Gen. Kiszczak
too hastily and now our electors blame us for that,'' Bentkowski
later told PAP. He said that had to be relayed to Kiszczak and the
Peasant Party leadership.
   For his part, Kiszczak, the former interior minister, said he
was open to all proposals from the Peasant Party and declared his
readiness for cooperation.
   Communist party floor leader Marian Orzechowski told his caucus
he had presented to Kiszczak the need for new faces in the
government, PAP reported.
   Peasant Party deputies expressed opposition to Kiszczak during a
stormy caucus Wednesday night. The group took no official stand on
the future government at a meeting Thursday, and more debate is
planned next week.
   A handful of Peasant Party lawmakers, led by Bentkowski,
received leading Solidarity lawmakers Thursday at Peasant Party
headquarters. Walesa delegated Sen. Jaroslaw Kaczynski of Elblag as
his envoy.
   The closed meeting had been proposed as a preliminary exchange
of views on the possible shape of a Solidarity-Peasant coalition.
   ``We're at the beginning of the beginning,'' Kaczynski said
before the meeting. He said afterward the talks would continue.
   Kaczynski also met with Tadeusz Rymszewicz, a leader of the
Democratic Party, a smaller party that also has expressed interest
in a non-communist coalition. PAP said they discussed Walesa's
proposal.
   Although Kiszczak is trying to assemble a Cabinet to present to
the Sejm on Aug. 23 or Aug. 24, Solidarity parliamentary leader
Bronislaw Geremek said his caucus would seek a coaltion with the
Peasants and Democrats before then.
   The Solidarity trade union has increased pressure on authorities
by urging union members nationwide to plan ``protest actions''
against government economic and political policies.
   With Solidarity's 161 parliamentary seats and the Peasants' 76,
a Solidarity-Peasant alliance would have a bare working majority of
237 votes in the 460-member parliament, but they would have a firm
majority if joined by the 27-member Democratcs.
   The possiblity of a non-communist coalition has prompted
expressions of alarm among communist authorities.
   The Politburo said Tuesday such a coalition could threaten
stability.
   The communist coalition was guaranteed 65 percent of the Sejm
seats and Solidarity allowed to contest only 35 percent under the
agreement that set forth the conditions for Poland's freest vote in
40 years in June.
   But the communist party became a minority party in the Sejm for
the first time, holding only 173 seats and thus depending on its
previously obedient allies for a majority. Solidarity won all 161
of the seats it was allowed to contest.
   Peasant and Democratic legislators used to owe their seats to
communist-led nominating boards, but this time were elected in
competitive voting.
   The communist alliance elected Kiszczak prime minister over
Solidarity's objection Aug. 2, but now shows signs of crumbling
after Walesa proposed the Solidarity-Peasant-Democrat alliance.
   The communist alliance is being strained by the negative
reaction to Kiszczak's election and growing anger over sharply
increasing food prices and the lack of consumer goods.

   Federal investigators Thursday examined the
battered tail engine of a Northwest Airlines DC-10 that made an
emergency landing after the engine broke up.
   None of the 256 people aboard was injured. A piece of the
engine's tail cone was missing and there were numerous small holes
in the engine cover, said Joseph Nall, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   ``The initial look at the aircraft shows relatively minor
external damage to the No. 2 engine,'' Nall said after
investigators inspected the plane in a hangar at Stapleton
International Airport.
   Nall said a fuel cutoff line also was severed when the engine
broke apart in flight, but crew members used a backup system to
shut down the engine shortly before making an emergency landing
Wednesday at Stapleton.
   Nall said the flight and data recorders of the DC-10 were taken
to Washington, D.C., where inspection showed that only the last 30
minutes of the emergency were recorded and the engine failure
itself apparently was erased.
   Stapleton spokesman Richard Boulware, who saw the damaged
engine, said, ``One of the holes was big enough I could have stuck
my hand through.''
   Boulware said he also saw broken turbine fan blades inside the
engine.
   Officials declined to compare Wednesday's incident with the
General Electric tail-engine failure that preceded last month's
crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, that killed
111 people.
   ``We are looking at this incident on its own, on its merit,''
Nall said. ``All we're doing at this point is looking at this
accident, this DC-10, this Pratt &amp; Whitney engine. We're not
looking at DC-10s.''
   Flight 308 was en route from Los Angeles to Minneapolis when the
engine began breaking up. The crew reported a loss of oil pressure
and severe vibration in the tail engine and shut it down, said Greg
Feith, an NTSB spokesman in Denver.
   The plane landed safely in Denver a half hour later, at about
6:30 p.m.
   Investigators from the NTSB, the Federal Aviation Administration
and Northwest examined the plane. Nall said NTSB investigators
expected to interview crew members within the next week.
   Feith said accidents that do not involve fatalities or extensive
damage to aircraft usually are investigated by regional offices,
but the Northwest failure was ``too much of a coincidence''
following the Sioux City crash.
   The No. 2 engine, one of three on the jet, is mounted in the
aircraft's vertical stabilizer, just above the tail wing. On
United's Flight 232, the No. 2 engine disintegrated, shooting
shrapnel that apparently severed hydraulic lines used to control
the jet. The investigation into the cause of that crash is
continuing.
   In Washington, FAA chief James B. Busey said agency officials
``know of no hard facts that would lead us to take action to ground
DC-10s.''
   Busey said there is insufficient information yet to link the
incident with the Iowa crash, and said the DC-10 is ``safe to fly.
I would fly in the aircraft today.''
   He called it a ``comfortable, good-performing'' airliner.
   Busey said the Northwest incident was an example of ``the way
the system should work'' because the pilots quickly shut down the
engine, diverted to a nearby airport and landed safely with no
injuries.

<HEAD>Buchi Chosen Lone Goverment Candidate To Succeed Pinochet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY EVA VERGARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Finance Minister Hernan Buchi on
Thursday became the lone government candidate in the race to
succeed military President Augusto Pinochet after a veteran
politician withdrew from the race.
   Voters on Dec. 14 will pick a succeessor to Pinochet, who took
power in a bloody military coup in 1973.
   Buchi _ considered Pinochet's candidate _ was credited for much
of Chile's economic recovery, boosting exports and presiding over a
decline in inflation and the nation's foreign debt.
   But the opposition _ united around the Christian Democratic
Party's Patricio Aylwin _ is expected to win the vote. The
coalition of 17 parties ranging from left to center-right has
promised its economic policies will emphasize aid to the nation's
growing number of poor.
   The new government is to take office on March 11, 1990. It will
be the first presidential election since Chileans chose Salvador
Allende, an avowed Marxist, in 1970.
   Sergio Jarpa, president of National Renewal, the nation's
largest conservative party, said his party would formally endorse
Buchi.
   Buchi, 40, called Jarpa's decision to step aside ``a show of
patriotism.'' Jarpa's announcement ended long and often difficult
negotiations among Pinochet's supporters, who hoped to face the
election with a single candidate.
   Pinochet was obliged to call the election after losing an
October referendum in which voters rejected a proposal to extend
his rule until 1997.
   The 73-year-old president and army commander is barred by the
constitution from seeking re-election. He has said, however, he
will retain his position as army commander in the next
administration.
   As finance minister from 1985 through April, Buchi led economic
policies that won substantial praise from bankers at home and
abroad.
   Inflation has fallen to 15 percent annually, a modest figure by
Latin American standards. Buchi also encouraged exports, which
boomed to $7 billion last year, leaving a surplus of $2 billion.
   The nation's foreign debt was cut from $21 billion three years
ago to $16.5 billion today.
   Even so, opinion polls give the 70-year-old Aylwin a substantial
advantage over Buchi. A poll released Thursday by the Center for
Contemporary Studies, a respected private research institution,
gives Aylwin the support of 53.8 percent of those polled to Buchi's
23.8 percent.

   A weather satellite passing directly over
Ethiopia picked up a second emergency distress signal Thursday, far
away from an earlier signal but still boosting cnfidence that it
came from the plane of missing Rep. Mickey Leland, officials said.
   The satellite that picked up the second signal passed directly
over Ethiopia and read the signal as coming from about 100 miles
north-northwest of Addis Ababa. Leland's plane was supposed to be
going southwest, far from where the new signal was detected.
   ``We have greater confidence in this particular signal because
the satellite was in a better position to make a location,'' said
Russell Koffler of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration.
   The newest signal was picked up about 6 p.m. EDT on a different
wavelength from the signal the satellite detected Wednesday night,
Washington time.
   Koffler said the plane Leland, D-Texas, was flying in has the
capability to broadcast on both the wavelengths that have been
picked up.
   The newest signal comes from far from the earlier signal,
however, which officials believe was southwest of Addis Ababa. Both
signals have been far from the flight path Leland's plane would
have taken to reach the refugee camps near the Sudanese border he
was headed for when his plane was reported missing on Monday.
   ``We are confident we got a good fix. We have more confidence in
this signal than in the one last night,'' said Koffler.
   ``It doesn't mean it's from that particular plane,'' he
cautioned, adding there would be few such sources for distress
signals in the thinly populated African nation, however.
   Koffler said the clarity of the latest signal, the knowledge
that Leland's plane could transmit signals on both wavelengths that
have been detected and the rarity of other distress signals
increased belief that the new signal came from Leland's plane.
   Ethiopia was at the edge of the area covered by the satellite
when it picked up the earlier signal. Search teams have headed on
foot for the remote mountain area where the earlier signal was
believed to originate and searchers hoped to send planes to that
region at Friday's daybreak in Ethiopia.
   Like the earlier signal, the new signal was relayed from the
satellite to a ground station in India.
   ``We'd normally have confidence within a 20-mile radius with
that signal, but it is still fairly marginal'' because of the
distance the signal was relayed, said Koffler.

<HEAD>Peru Declares State of Emergency in Province Near Lima</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government declared a Lima province under
a 30-day state of emergency Thursday, suspending civil rights and
granting broad powers to the military to fight leftist insurgents.
   With the addition of Huarochiri, which starts 30 miles east of
Lima's city limits and has 60,000 inhabitants, eight departments
and three provinces are under emergency restrictions.
   In Peru, a department is the largest political subdivision and
is divided into provinces.
   The emergency restrictions cover one-third of Peru and affect
more than half of its 21 million residents.
   The government has used state of emergency decrees to combat the
guerrillas since 1982. Among the restrictions implied in the decree
are suspension of the rights of free movement and guarantees
against search and seizure.
   According to the official government newspaper El Peruano, the
measures were applied to Huarochiri because of its strategic
importance as a mining center.
   Two rebel groups, the Maoist Shining Path and the pro-Cuba Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement, are known to operate in the area. The
groups target the mines to steal dynamite and to damage the mining
industry, which provides Peru with more than half its foreign
export earnings.
   The Shining Path began its armed insurgency against Peru's
elected government in 1980 near the highland city of Ayacucho, 235
miles southeast of Lima. It now operates throughout the Andean
highlands, in some coastal areas and in the coca-producing jungles
of the northeast.
   The smaller Tupac Amaru rebels, who take their name from an 18th
century mestizo revolutionary who fought to free Peru from colonial
Spanish rule, operate separately and in competition with the
Shining Path.
   The Tupac Amaru guerrillas took up arms in 1984 and have mostly
engaged in urban attacks against government and commercial targets.
However, in the last two years they have expanded into the
highlands and jungle areas.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have died in the
violence.

<TEXT>
   A stronger role in politics for black women
is the goal of the National Political Congress of Black Women,
which convened Thursday in New Orleans to draft its national policy
agenda.
   The non-partisan association founded in 1984 by former U.S. Rep.
Shirley Chisholm is holding its convention here through Sunday.
Organizers of the conference expect more than 2,000 black women to
attend.
   ``We're here to make sure political parity becomes a reality for
Afro-American women before we move into century 21,'' said C.
Delores Tucker, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee's
Black Caucus.
   ``We will challenge women here to take firm positions in local
government and demand the power that goes with it, to re-claim
their neighborhoods and to support black-owned businesses,'' Tucker
said.
   Tucker, who is the NPCBW's vice-chairwoman, said 1987 figures
show black women held 1,482 of the more than 500,000 elected
offices nationwide.
   The organization's mission is to register black women voters,
develop public policy, seek women to hold elective office and
develop them as candidates and involve young people as early as
possible in politics, Tucker said.
   ``This conference is about the business of addressing the issues
of major concern to those of us who are Afro-American _ the drug
issues, the issues of affirmative action and civil rights and the
issues of education,'' said Chisholm, the organization's national
chairwoman.
   The group must continue to confront whatever obstacles appear in
the effort to gain an equal political voice, said Dr. Gloria Toote,
former assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and also vice-chairwoman.
   ``We're not asking for affirmative action that gives reverse
discrimination but we are asking for affirmative action that
promises 20 acres and a mule,'' Toote said. ``For had the ex-slave
of America received the 20 acres and a mule we would not now be the
under class of America, the illiterate of America and the last
hired first fired of America.'' she said.

   Edward Lujan, a state Republican Party
leader and brother of U.S. Secretary of Interior Manuel Lujan Jr.,
suffered a heart attack Thursday, an aide to the secretary said.
   Edward Lujan, an Albuquerque insurance executive, was in stable
but guarded condition at Valley View Hospital in Glenwood Springs,
Colo., Steve Goldstein said from his office in Washington, D.C.
   Lujan and his wife, Virginia, were in Colorado on vacation,
Goldstein said. They were at a recreational vehicle park Thursday
morning, where Lujan was unhooking hoses to the RV when he felt
pain. Mrs. Lujan drove her husband to the hospital.
   Edward Lujan is a former chairman of the New Mexico GOP and was
unsuccessful in his bid last year for the Republican nomination for
the U.S. House seat left vacant when Manuel Lujan retired after 10
terms.
   Goldstein said Manuel Lujan was in Albuquerque and would go to
Colorado on Thursday. Manuel Lujan suffered a heart attack in 1986
and had triple bypass surgery. Goldstein said he has fully covered.

   President Kenneth Kaunda said Thursday he
will meet the leader of South Africa's governing party, F.W. de
Klerk, on Aug. 28 for talks on ways to end apartheid.
   De Klerk, as head of the National Party, is expected to become
South Africa's president after Sept. 6 parliamentary elections.
   In South Africa, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said he would
accompany de Klerk on the visit to Livingstone, Zambia. He said the
visit grew out of talks initiated with Kuanda by retiring South
African President P.W. Botha.
   He gave no further information.
   Kaunda announced the meeting following a one-day summit in
Lusaka of the six African nations aligned against white-governed
South Africa.
   ``I have briefed my colleagues and I will meet him (De Klerk) in
Livingstone on Aug. 28,'' he told reporters.
   Kaunda is chairman of the six-nation group, which comprises
Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
   The Zambian president has led calls for isolation of South
Africa until it ends its policy of racial separation known as
apartheid. The African National Congress, the main guerrilla group
fighting to overthrow the South African goverment, is based in
Zambia.

<TEXT>
   A former live-in maid who bilked nearly
$900,000 from an elderly, paralyzed widow kept prisoner in her own
home was sentenced Thursday to three years in prison.
   Barbara June Stevens, 54, was sentenced to serve the prison term
along with 10 years probation under a plea bargain struck with
prosecutors last month.
   Prosecutors said Ms. Stevens confined 71-year-old Valeria Lust
to her Lakeland home by taking away the woman's walker and
telephone and by giving her illegally obtained prescription drugs
to keep her sleepy.
   Some of the $883,534 stolen from the widow in 1987-88 went to
Fountain of Life Inc., a TV ministry in Greenville, N.C., and to
Sonshine Cathedral in Highland City, authorities said.
   Under the plea agreement, Ms. Stevens is required to testify and
cooperate in the investigation of Fountain of Life televangelist
Jim Whittington and the Rev. Daniel Atwood, former pastor of
Sonshine Cathedral.
   Neither Wittington nor Atwood _ who is serving a prison sentence
in Pennsylvania for stealing from followers _ has been charged in
the case.
   Ms. Stevens pleaded guilty last month to charges including
kidnapping, forgery, grand theft and conspiracy. In the plea
bargain, prosecutors agreed to drop 55 other charges that could
have brought a life prison term.
   Assistant Public Defender Frank Solorzano said at the sentencing
hearing that Ms. Stevens was ``largely a victim herself.''
   ``She's a very religious person,'' he said. ``She looks for
false prophets.''

   A man who moves erratically because of severe
multiple sclerosis was arrested Thursday when police escorting
Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford saw him with a gun which turned out to an
unloaded collector's item.
   No one was injured in the incident in Florence, a town southwest
of Phoenix, and Mrs. Mofford went about her business, officials
said.
   Raymond P. Herand, 42, a former county prosecutor, was
questioned and released after officers determined that he had not
known Mrs. Mofford was in the area and had no intention of
threatening anyone, said Sgt. Allan Schmidt, chief spokesman at the
state Department of Public Safety.
   ``There are no charges,'' he said. ``None will be filed.''
   Mrs. Mofford praised the officers for protecting her and said
she hadn't seen the incident. ``I really didn't know what was
happening,'' she said, adding that she wasn't scared.
   Herand's home telephone was not answered, and an office that has
taken messages for him in the past said it had no way of contacting
him.
   Schmidt said Florence Police Chief Tom Rankin and three state
officers spotted Herand near his car with a gun just as Mrs.
Mofford and her top aides were preparing to leave a restaurant
after a task force meeting on state prisons.
   There were varying accounts on exactly what happened next but
general agreement by Schmidt, Mofford press secretary Vada Manager
and several eyewitnesses that Mrs. Mofford stayed in the restaurant
while officers took Herand in custody and grabbed the weapon.
   ``I stepped back and pulled the governor,'' said state Land
Commissioner M. Jean Hassell. ``She was very, very calm and very
collected. There was no panic.''
   One of the officers on the governor's security detail also
stayed with her, Schmidt and Manager said.
   ``She did not know of it as it was occurring,'' Schmidt said.
   Herand, a former assistant Pinal County attorney who now lives
in Glendale, did not resist.
   He later explained to officers that he had the gun on his
dashboard because of a law requiring that weapons in cars be in
full view, and had taken it from the vehicle to protect it from the
heat of the sun, Schmidt said. He said officers found no evidence
that the gun had ever been used.
   The police officers reacted appropriately because ``you have to
presume the worst,'' Schmidt added. ``You don't ask. You just do.''
   A local state officer grabbed Herand's gun while Rankin turned
him around, Schmidt said. Another state officer handcuffed the man.
   Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, was elected as secretary of state in
1986 but became governor last year when the legislature impeached
elected Republican Gov. Evan Mecham.

   An FBI agent testified Thursday that he
literally caught a bank robbery suspect redhanded as the man was
waiting for a flight at Salt Lake International Airport.
   FBI Agent Paul Ladner told a federal court jury he found red dye
on David Lee Martin's forearm and hand, indicative of the red
substance that explodes out of dye packs hidden in bags of bills by
bank tellers.
   Dye-splotched bills also were found in a backpack the defendant
was carrying, and dye stains and burn marks were discovered on his
body after he was taken to the Salt Lake County Jail, Ladner said.
   Martin, accused of being the ``Baby Face Robber'' profiled on
the America's Most Wanted television program, is charged in U.S.
District Court with robbing the First Interstate Bank in Sugar
House of $1,562 on June 20.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Schwendiman said Martin also is
wanted in bank robberies in Denver, Los Angeles and San Diego. He
faces prosecution in Colorado and California in 16 separate
robberies.
   Police in Lafayette, Colo., Martin's former hometown, also have
a warrant for his arrest stemming from a June 1988 burglary.
   Tim Talbot, a ticketing agent for AmericaWest Airlines,
testified at Thursday's proceedings that money Martin used to pay
for an airline ticket to Reno, Nev., was covered with a red
substance.
   FBI agents had informed airport security that a bank robbery
suspect might attempt to buy a ticket to Reno after Martin
allegedly told the cab driver who brought him to the airport of his
destination.
   The driver, Tim Newland, said in a police report he thought he
recognized Martin from the TV program, which aired June 11.
   Talbot identified Martin to FBI agents who intercepted the
defendant as he tried to leave the airport. Several bank employees
at the trial identified Martin as the man who robbed the bank.
   If convicted, Martin, 24, faces up to 20 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   When the Utah trial is finished, Martin likely will be brought
to Colorado to face four counts of bank larceny, said assistant
U.S. Attorney Tom O'Rourke.

<HEAD>SWAPO Says South Africa Out To Rig Namibian Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main Namibian rebel group said
Thursday that South Africa will run 150,000 South African voters
and Angolan guerrillas into Namibia to rig November's election,
``with the connivance'' of U.N. officials.
   The Angolan guerrillas, members of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, have has fought the Marxist
government of Angola with South African aid since losing out in a
civil war after independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Hinyangerwa Asheeke, the U.N. observer for Nambia's South West
Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO, suggested that the rebel
movement would not recognize the results of an election that is not
``free and fair.''
   African nations asked the Security Council to meet urgently
Monday on ``the deteriorating situation in Namibia.'' Ghanaian
Ambassador J.V. Gbeho made the request in a letter to the council's
president.
   Besides the situation Asheeke complained about, the nations are
upset over the presence of former members of the counterinsurgency
patrol Koevoet in the territory's police. They are also worried
about election registration procedures that would enable
authorities to record how individuals voted, and a cumbersome
vote-counting process.
   A spokesman for South Africa's U.N. Mission, Aubrey K. Dwyer,
replied that South Africans are eligible to vote under
U.N.-approved election laws for Namibia, and that U.N. election
monitors would prevent ineligible voters such as the Angolan
guerrillas from perpetrating vote fraud.
   SWAPO fought a guerrilla war from 1966 against South Africa's
rule in Namibia, but it accepted a cease-fire. It is the largest
Namibian political party.
   Asheeke said a loophole in Namibia's election law allows up to
100,000 South Africans who worked in Namibia for four years or more
to register to vote.
   He said an additional 50,000 Angolan rebels will be fraudulently
registered to vote in Namibia, a land of 1.3 million people.
   South African officials have estimated from 500,000 to 600,000
people will register to vote.
   An influx of anti-SWAPO voters could deny the Marxist party a
two-thirds majority in the election for a constituent assembly,
forcing it to form a coalition government that would be more
cooperative with South Africa.
   Asheeke said ``Pretoria proceeded with enacting this election
law, obviously with the connivance of the special representative of
the United Nations'' in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari.
   As U.N. special representative for Namibia, Ahtisaari must
approve the election laws, and could suspend the election if he
believes the process is not free and fair. He has not suggested he
will do that.
   On April 1, U.N. peacekeepers and administrators began
implementing a one-year plan to oversee the transition to
independence.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I.
   South Africa signed accords with Angola and Cuba in December,
agreeing to free Namibia if 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola
are sent home by mid-1991.
   In Windhoek, Namibia, relatives said Thursday that 79 Namibians
held prisoner by SWAPO have returned home in the past two weeks,
but more than 1,000 remain jailed in southern Angola.
   The Parents Committee of Namibia, whose family members were
detained by SWAPO, said the 79 came back unexpectedly along with
refugees returning in the big U.N. repatriation campaign.

   President Bush, saying he doesn't want to miss
any signal that might lead to freedom for American hostages, is
again extending a hand to Iran while insisting he won't make any
deals.
   ``I hope I'm open-minded enough to talk and to exercise every
diplomatic channel I can to free these Americans,'' the president
told reporters Wednesday.
   However, Bush insisted he would do nothing ``that would put some
other American, perhaps in some other place, at some other time, at
risk, and that means trading off or negotiating for hostages.''
   As the president continued to press diplomatic efforts,
including talks through third parties with Iran, he urged all
American churches, synagogues and other places of worship to ``say
a special prayer this weekend'' for the hostages, their families
and for world peace.

   Some savers can expect less interest on their
deposits and families may soon find it a bit less expensive to buy
a home, as the government today begins spending $50 billion to
resolve the savings and loan crisis.
   President Bush signed legislation Wednesday committing American
taxpayers to an estimated $157 billion _ $600 for every man, woman
and child _ over the next 30 years to solve the nation's biggest
financial crisis since the Depression.
   ``We can and will preserve a safe, efficient and equitable
financial system for ourselves and ... for our kids,'' Bush said
before signing a bill providing money to cover more than $100
billion in S&amp;L losses over the past decade to speculative, and
often fraudulent, lending.
   The Treasury Department planned today to borrow the first $5
billion of a $20 billion downpayment to be made over the next seven
weeks to reduce an estimated $20 million in daily losses by
insolvent but still operating S&amp;Ls.

   People in Felix Bloch's position often put a
coat over their heads or run the other way whenever a news camera
is pointed at them. But Bloch, the most visible spy suspect ever,
uses a different approach.
   He makes himself available to every lens and microphone.
   ``I've developed a real symbiotic relationship with the media,''
said Bloch, who has _ not by choice _ been leading a caravan of FBI
and news people since it was revealed he is suspected of spying for
the Soviet Union.
   Bloch's walks around Washington are attracting attention the way
Harry Truman's used to. Bloch made a trip to the cleaners Wednesday
and it was recorded by cameras. He went for a 22-mile hike Tuesday
and caused a coterie of Bloch watchers to go huffing and puffing

   Babies conceived in laboratories with the
high-tech help of fertility experts are just as likely to be normal
as babies made by amateurs in the traditional way, researchers say.
   The study was conducted to determine if infants conceived by in
vitro fertilization _ the so-called test-tube babies _ are more apt
to develop physical or mental abnormalities than other children,
said Dr. James L. Mills, a National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development researcher.
   ``The original question was, `are these children going to be
developmentally delayed?' The answer to that is very clearly not,''
Mills said Wednesday in a telephone interview. ``They did extremely
well.''
   In a study published this month in the Journal of Pediatrics,
Mills and a team of scientists from Eastern Virginia Medical School
compared the development of 83 children born as a result of in
vitro fertilization, or IVF, with 93 children born from normal
conception. The children were matched by age, sex, race, age of the
mother and other factors. They were all between 12 months and 30
months old.

   Tuition inflation is easing a bit at many
colleges, especially public two-year institutions, but a year at
the costliest private colleges will top $21,000, an annual survey
shows.
   The College Board, in its annual tuition survey released
Wednesday, found average charges heading 5 to 9 percent higher come
fall.
   At two-year public colleges, the increase will average 5 percent
to $842, slightly less than the 5.9 percent annualized rise in
consumer prices during the first six months of 1989.
   Average tuition and fees at four-year public institutions will
increase 7 percent to $1,694, with an additional $3,039 in average
room and board charges.

   General Mills Inc. says its new cereal is
nothing more than a breakfast food that can reduce cholesterol, but
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. thinks it should be tested as a drug if it's
going to make health claims.
   P&amp;G, which sells over-the-counter medicines, wants the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration to order General Mills to pull the cereal,
Benefit, off the market. It contends cereals should under the same
federal testing as drugs before health benefits such as reduced
cholesteral can be advertised.
   General Mills disagrees.
   ``It's a cereal that's made from grain. It's consumed like a
cereal. It's no different from any other cereal that's on the
marketplace that contains soluble fiber and has the ability to
lower cholesterol,'' General Mills spokesman Craig Shulstad said
Wednesday.

   A pond in Brooklyn's Prospect Park is a quiet
spot, rimmed by tall oaks and a meadow. But early each morning it
goes to the dogs.
   Dogs by the hundreds are unleashed around it, many running
around a field before taking an early morning dip. Before 8 a.m.,
park police don't enforce the leash law, and the dogs don't waste
the precious time.
   ``All I have to do is say the word, `park,' and they are out the
door,'' said Allen Koppelman, owner of a greyhound and a Russian
wolfhound.
   The morning romps in the park are just one sign of the largely
unnoticed ``other society'' living in New York _ an estimated
600,000 dogs.
   Their owners form social groups, such as the Prospect Park Dog &amp;
Breakfast Club. They hire dog walkers, form dog play groups,
frequent canine clothing shops.
   When they meet, they discuss the peculiar trials of keeping a
pooch in the city, from pooper-scooper vigilantes to landlords who
won't let anything with four legs in the door.
   ``It's a whole other society in this city,'' said Joan
Chrysikopoulos, 30, who owns two miniature poodles. ``People buy
dogs coats, hats, have sweaters knit for them.''
   Dogs are big business, with several specialty shops in the Upper
East Side selling items costing hundreds of dollars.
   ``If they can afford to buy dogs for $1,500, they can afford to
take care of them,'' said Karen Thompson, owner of Karen's For
People and Pets, a pet accessory and dog grooming shop.
   Chrysikopolous believes there's another reason for spoiling
dogs. ``The guilt factor is tremendous. You know your dog can't go
outdoors when he wants to. I worry that they are so bored.''
   She has bought her dogs sweaters and raincoats. ``If it's below
50, it's definitely a sweater. They live in an apartment all day
and aren't used to the cold.''
   The raincoats may be more for show. ``I would never have put a
raincoat on a dog if we lived in the suburbs. Here there's more
peer pressure,'' Chrysikopolous said.
   The biggest issue for dog owners, though, is finding space for
their pets to run. Last fall, park police began enforcing the leash
law after many years of not doing so, writing $50 tickets to
violators.
   The reaction was swift. Dog groups formed, including
Chrysikopoulos' Carl Schurtz Park Dog Owners Group, and they
protested to park officials. Pro-leash groups formed to fight back.
   William F. Dalton, chief of citywide services for the Parks
Department, surprised by the intense feelings over dogs, held a
dozen meetings.
   The temporary solution was to not enforce the law until 8 a.m.
The parks department is also considering confined areas for dog
runs, longer weekend off-leash hours and even obedience tests where
no-leash licenses could be given for dogs that respond to their
master.
   Fran Lee, founder of Children Before Dogs, boils in anger at
this. Letting dogs run free, she said, increases the threat of
bites _ 8,000 are reported in the city each year _ and
dog-transmitted diseases, especially from excrement.
   ``I happen to love animals,'' she said. ``But I hate the animal
owners.''
   She chases owners who don't scoop up after their dogs. When one
woman refused her command, Lee says she picked up the poop and
dumped it on the woman's head.
   ``When a dog is pooping on the street, everyone is militant
about that,'' said 23-year-old Tina Caruso, who runs Dogsbuddy, a
dog walking service. ``They stand there and wait to see if you pick
it up. I make sure I'm standing poised with a plastic bag in my
hand.''
   Still, if there are hassles, dog owners also find rewards in
city living.
   Members of the Prospect Park Dog &amp; Breakfast Club bring bagels
and coffee while their dogs cavort.
   ``My dog is better socialized in the city than when we lived in
the suburbs,'' said Melanie Sutherland, talking about Morgan, a
border collie.
   Chris Panny, 34, said the park provided a dog play group for his
cocker spaniel, Zuckie.
   Someone threw a tennis ball in the water. Zuckie went out after
it, one of a half-dozen dogs with the same idea.
   ``Look at that! Look at that!'' Panny said. ``He's going to the
middle of the lake!''
   Zuckie mouthed the ball expertly. Owners all around clapped
appreciatively.

<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen J. Cannell has created a couple dozen
television series, among them at least two sure to be included in
any history of television.
   In 1974, Cannell's ``The Rockford Files'' premiered, starring
James Garner as TV's first truly realistic private eye _ one who
ran credit checks on prospective clients and quit cases immediately
upon suffering any kind of physical threat. The critics loved it
and so did audiences.
   A decade later, Cannell created another ``different'' series,
featuring a rag-tag band of misfits who joined together to fight
the bad guys. ``The A-Team'' made a cultural icon out of Mr. T. The
show got huge ratings, but the critics hated it, labeling it
cartoonish, violent junk TV.
   Later, Cannell followed with ``Hunter,'' a hit in ratings that
was ignored or panned by the critics.
   Cannell rebounded with the critics two seasons ago with the
simmering, cerebral ``Wiseguy,'' starring Ken Wahl as a federal
agent deep undercover in various crime venues. It's up for five
Emmy awards.
   This coming season, Cannell takes another turn with ``Top of the
Hill,'' a thoughtful political drama starring William Katt
(``Greatest American Hero'') as an idealistic Californian who steps
in to take over his ailing father's congressional seat.
   The show will premiere next month on CBS.
   Cannell told a meeting of television critics that the show,
which has been in his mind for a few years, was based on the
real-life activist congressman Leo J. Ryan, D-Calif., who was
killed by followers of the Rev. Jim Jones when he went to Guyana to
investigate Jones' religious cult.
   Ryan, said Cannell, was an advocate for his constituency, not a
delegate. ``A delegate says, you elect me, I'll go to Washington,
I'll be your delegate. In two years, I'll come back, put my record
before you and you'll decide whether or not you want to return me
to the House. The advocate says, I will be your advocate. I will go
there, and if there is anything where you cannot get help, where
you are unable to use the system correctly to benefit yourself in a
situation where you've been wronged, then I will be your advocate.''
   Katt's Congressman Tom Bell is a Democrat, Cannell said, though
Bell's leaning to the liberal or conservative side will vary
depending on the issue with which he's presented. In the future,
those issues will include child custody conflicts, the media
feeding-frenzy over ethics violations, and the crumbling of
inner-city schools.
   Katt told the television critics he himself has not considered
running for office, but he would vote for a man like Bell, ``who
listens to his own conscience.''
   Cannell will have five shows on the air when the new season
opens. ``Hunter'' continues on NBC, ``Top of the Hill'' and
``Wiseguy'' are on CBS, and he has the continuing ``21 Jump
Street'' and the new ``Booker'' on Fox. This is not a record for
Cannell. He had five shows on the air in 1985, ``The A-Team,''
``Riptide,'' ``Hardcastle and McCormick,'' ``Hunter'' and
``Stingray.''
   Cannell, who writes many of the episodes of his shows, said he
prefers brainier stuff to the shoot-'em-ups like ``A-Team.''
   ``When I get to the part in a script where I have to do the old
shoot-out or the car chase or whatever it is,'' he said, ``that's
when I have to keep hitting myself in the head, you know, because
the fun part is to write the characters and the relationships and
the cerebral drama.''
   Cannell thinks ``the audience kind of got tired of car chases.
... I think Steve Bochco (`Hill Street Blues,' `L.A. Law'), who's a
dear friend of mine, went a long ways toward showing networks that
you could do different kinds of programming and still entertain.''
   ``Top of the Hill,'' not unlike Bochco's shows, will not shy
away from making political statements, but that's not its primary
purpose, Cannell said. ``I don't see my role here as inflicting my
sense of politics on anybody else, but rather to entertain you
through good dramas dealing with good relationships.
   ``I wouldn't know where I will eventually go with it,'' Cannell
said. ``But what I think I'm trying to say is that I think this
country could use a political figure as a hero to look up to, and
hopefully, Tom Bell can be that figure.''

   ANOTHER MAN IN A DIFFERENT HOUSE _ You think there weren't

``This Old House''? ``We had well over 400 resumes,'' said Russell
Morash, creator and executive producer of the popular fixer-upper
series. ``I heard from building inspectors who wanted the job. Got
a call from a brain surgeon. ... I heard from a well-known female
concert pianist. I heard from the guy that installed my burglar
alarm system.'' The man who finally got the job was Steve Thomas,
an author who had appeared in an episode of PBS' ``Adventure''
series. Former ``This Old House'' host Bob Vila left in a conflict
with the producers over his commercial endorsements.

<HEAD>Consumers in The Driver's Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not just in the automobile markets but in others
too you might say the consumer is in the driver's seat.
   The big automakers have all but conceded that they'll have to
continue with rebates and interest-rate incentives next year, which
in effect is saying that the prices they'd like to get aren't the
ones they will get.
   Since customers at various retail outlets, including those for
furniture and appliances, also have been restraining the impulse to
buy, it seems likely that discounting could spread, or at least
that price boosts will be minor.
   The mortgage market also is turning in favor of customers, with
prices for long-term fixed-rate mortgages now substantially below
those for adjustable rates, which means homeowners can switch and
lock in lower monthly payments.
   There are exceptions. In some areas the consumer just can't seem
to exert much influence, particularly on bank card interest rates,
which sometimes exceed 20 percent, not including annual charges
that tend to rise each year.
   But overall, the consumer has become a far more formidable
challenge for sellers. Buyers are choosier, better informed, not as
easily led. And, with the rise of imports, they have a much greater
selection from which to choose.
   The old uniformity of consumer markets is fractured. Buyers are
not nearly as predictable. Do you recall when carmakers told you
what car you would be drive next year because that was what they
were going to make and sell to you?
   Not any more. Thirty years ago market researchers could
categorize buyers by age and income. It was easy: People in their
30s and 40s were generally married, probably had two kids and
aspired to the same lifestyles.
   Market researchers and product designers who use the same
measurements today are befuddled when the results don't show up. No
longer can behavior be measured by age and income. Today, it is far
more variable.
   Richard Hokenson, a researcher who examines our changing society
for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. offers a cogent
analysis of marketplace behavior then and now.
   The parents of today's baby-boomers made up a far more
homogeneous population in terms of marriage, divorce and
childbearing, as well as in their opinions, such as the place of
women in the work force.
   Hokenson observes that, ``Nearly everyone in that generation got
married, few were divorced, nearly all women became mothers and few
women worked outside the home.''
   Things were predictable. If you had parachuted into a strange
suburban area of the 1950s to early 1970s, you would have known
immediately from the cars parked in the driveways the sociology and
economy of the neighborhood.
   A preponderance of Chevrolets would have meant residents just
starting out as wage earners. Buicks and Pontiacs would have
signified a rung higher on the ladder. Oldsmobiles still higher.
And Cadillacs, the top.
   In contrast, markets today are rearranged by the
``marriage-divorce-remarriage merry-go-round.'' There are lots of
stepchildren, and more married-couple families without children
than married-couple families with children.
   The baby-boomers, in other words, are very different people in a
marketing sense than their parents, and any sellers who fail to
catch the difference are headed for trouble.
   A lot of companies have failed to do so. Many, such as General
Motors Corp., are trying. GM has been telling younger consumers,
for example, that Oldsmobiles are no longer just their father's
cars but are fit for their own tastes.
   Hokenson believes that the many personalities of the consumer
will force companies to reposition products. Companies will have to
search for approaches, and their frustration will be seen in
frequent changes of advertising agencies.
   To adapt means that companies will have to think locally and
regionally, accommodating themselves to state and regional
differences. A vast array of new products and services are likely
to be developed to serve the varied markets.
   It isn't just that America is getting older and smarter, it is
getting more complex and demanding too, says Hokenson. Consumers
aren't the predictable and somewhat defenseless creatures they once
may have been.
   They, not the sellers, are dictating the terms. For the time
being anyway, consumers rather than producers seem to be in the
driver's seat.

   Jack Haley Jr. was only 5, but he has a vivid
memory of his visit to the set of ``The Wizard of Oz'' in 1939.
   ``The colors, that's what I remember _ the most impressive,
incredible color I've ever seen. They must had every klieg light in
Hollywood on that set,'' he said.
   ``And, of course, I remember the Munchkins. I thought they lived
right there on that movie set. I knew they were adults because some
of them had mustaches and beards. But I thought they were little
people who lived in those little huts.''
   Haley has lived with ``The Wizard of Oz'' most of his life. The
aura of playing the Tin Woodman never left his father, Jack Haley.
And now, for the golden anniversary of the movie classic, Haley is
preparing a film history of the production, which will appear on
CBS next spring, prior to the network's 23rd airing of the film.
The movie also appeared on NBC eight times.
   The television special is part of a mammoth celebration of the
50th anniversary of ``The Wizard of Oz.'' The festivities include
an army of tap dancers in New York's Herald Square as part of a
Macy's department store promotion Aug. 13; screenings of a
mint-condition print at New York's Museum of Modern Art Aug. 14-15;
release of the movie in home video with a postscript of newly-found
film and photos; a merchandising campaign.
   All of this is being directed by the Turner Broadcasting System
which owns the rights to ``The Wizard of Oz.''
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' has a long history in cinema. The author of
the Oz books, Lyman Frank Baum (1856-1919) made silent movies with
the characters from 1914 to 1917. He started the Oz Film
Manufacturing Co. in 1914, turning out shorts as well as
feature-length movies. They were fairly successful, but
distribution problems and his own failing health caused him to
close down the company.
   Samuel Goldwyn purchased the rights to the Oz books in 1932 for
$40,000 but made no films. When Walt Disney's ``Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs'' proved a smash in 1937, studios hunted for
children's classics. Louis B. Mayer bought the rights for MGM for
$75,000.
   Mervyn Leroy, who had directed such hard-hitting films as ``I Am
a Fugitive From a Chain Gang'' and ``Little Caesar,'' was a curious
choice to produce ``The Wizard of Oz.'' He assigned writer after
writer in an attempt to fashion a script. E.Y. (Yip) Harburg and
Harold Arlen were assigned to write the songs.
   Because of the large budget, MGM wanted Shirley Temple,
Hollywood's No. 1 moneymaker, to give the film box-office
insurance. Darryl Zanuck refused to release 20th Century-Fox's most
valuable asset. Judy Garland was taken out of B pictures to star as
Dorothy.
   Leroy originally wanted Ray Bolger to play the Tin Woodman.
``I'm not a tin performer, I'm fluid,'' he argued, seeking the
Scarecrow instead. He won his case, and the Woodman befell Buddy
Ebsen.
   Ed Wynn and W.C. Fields both declined the role of the Wizard,
according to ``The Making of `The Wizard of Oz''' by Aljean
Harmetz. The part was given to Frank Morgan, who like Ebsen and
Bolger was an MGM contract player. Bert Lahr came from Broadway to
play the Cowardly Lion.
   Richard Thorpe started directing the film on Oct. 12, 1938.
After 12 days he was fired because his work lacked a sense of
fantasy. Victor Fleming took over the direction, but he left before
finishing the black-and-white sequences. He was needed to replace
George Cukor on ``Gone With the Wind.''
   King Vidor finished directing ``The Wizard of Oz,'' including
the ``Over the Rainbow'' number. But Fleming received film credit.
   Then came another substitution. The aluminum paint poisoned
Buddy Ebsen, and Jack Haley assumed the role.

   ``The Wizard of Oz'' was completed on March 16, 1939. The final
budget was $2,777,000, a huge amount for those times. MGM launched
a big promotion campaign in hopes of recouping the investment.
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' premiered at the Grauman's Chinese theater
on Aug. 15, 1939. The New York opening followed two nights later at
the ``air-conditioned'' Capitol theater on Broadway.
   The reviews were mixed. The New York Times' Frank Nugent
declared: ``It is so well intentioned, so genial, and so gay than
any reviewer who would look down his nose at the fun-making should
be spanked and sent off, supperless, to bed.''
   A number of critics qualified for such treatment. The New Yorker
called ``The Wizard of Oz'' a ``stinkeroo'' which ``displays no
trace of imagination, good taste or ingenuity.''
   The New Republic's Otis Ferguson had unkind words for Judy
Garland: ``It isn't that this little slip of a miss spoils the
fantasy so much as that her thumping, overgrown gambols are
characteristic of its treatment here. When she is merry, the house
shakes, and everybody gets wet when she is forlorn.''
   Theater returns were good at first, then fell off. ``The Wizard
of Oz'' grossed $3,017,000 for the studio, causing a huge loss. A
re-release in 1948-49 brought in $1.5 million, enough to turn a
bare profit.
   ``The Wizard'' would have sunk into the limbo of failed movies
except for television. In 1956, CBS was eager to broadcast ``Gone
With the Wind,'' but MGM refused to part with its biggest
moneymaker.
   A CBS executive suggested ``The Wizard of Oz.'' The deal was
struck for one screening at $225,000, with an option for seven more
at $150,000 apiece. The film was shown on Nov. 3, 1956, and drew a
huge rating. Later runs did even better. More Americans have seen
``The Wizard of Oz'' than any other movie, and that record is
likely to continue into the 21st century.
   Meanwhile, MGM-UA plans to launch a seven-story hot air balloon
on Aug. 19, and fly it from Hollywood to Kansas to send Dorothy
home.
   According to a press release: ``We are planning an exciting day
full of special events to send Dorothy off in style.''

   In France, where World War II is known as '39-'45
to distinguish it from other German invasions, people no longer
glance nervously across the Rhine. But not everyone has forgotten.
   ``I'm afraid not many of these men like to talk about it,'' said
Jeanne de Barrel, who looks after 44 World War II victims at the
veterans hospital near Les Invalides, the vast complex Napoleon
used to house the casualties of his wars.
   ``Victims from the war of '14-'18 are more prepared to accept
what happened,'' she said. But for the war that started on Sept. 1,
1939, it is still too soon.
   The approach of the 50th anniversary of the war's outbreak has
prompted reflection on the period that saw France defeated and then
occupied for nearly four years.
   ``Most veterans blame a Nazi organization, not Germans,'' Madame
de Barrel said. ``My family suffered, too, and will be marked
forever. But one must evolve and move forward.''
   Maurice Desmier, a resident of Tours who lost an arm to German
shells on the Marne in the first year of the war, has long since
gotten on with his life. He heads an association of war amputees in
France.
   He is happy that a Franco-German army brigade now maneuvers
jointly. He sees no problem that both countries plan to join other
members of the European Economic Community in melding their
economies in a more united Europe beginning in 1992.
   Germany has invaded France three times since 1870. But the world
has changed.
   A decade ago, spurred by personal friendship between French
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt, France began extending its military umbrella to its
neighbor.
   The joint army brigade symbolized the new era. But the allies
found symbols work both ways. Officers cannot agree on a marching
pace. Significantly, the unit sat out France's Bastille Day parade
marking the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
   ``Fear is gone and, officially, there is no bad feeling against
the Germans,'' Desmier said. He paused and added: ``Of course, I
cannot say there is no resentment in people's hearts.''
   Attitudes vary widely, by geography, individual nature and
experience.
   After all these years, fresh flowers appear on the white grave
markers that seem to stretch out of sight by the beaches of
Normandy. No one has removed rusting shore guns from their bunkers.
   Rachel Ewenczyk, 78, refuses to shake the hand of any German of
her generation. Her father, sister and brother were among the
75,000 deported French Jews who did not survive death camps.
   But she is warm to German exchange students who come to Paris to
visit her grandchildren.
   In rural areas of the Correze, deep in France's heartland, some
people maintain stony silence at the mention of '39-'45.
   But in the tiny town of Moyau, just off the Normandy coast where
allied forces landed to liberate France, there seems to be little
rancor.
   ``Absolutely not, I have seen no resentment at all,'' said the
mayor's wife, Ingrid Charles, a German who has lived in Normandy
since she came as an au pair girl 26 years ago.
   ``Only the Dutch are sometimes reticient toward Germans, but
that doesn't last long,'' she said.
   She and her husband run an elegant campground at the Charles'
family chateau. Vacationing Germans frolic in the gardens once
seized by force of arms.
   Some veterans resent ungrateful countrymen as much as former
enemies.
   Asked if Frenchmen respected a 1940 law marking some subway and
train seats reserved for disabled war victims, Desmier said:
``Alas, no, unfortunately. The Frenchman is a very undisciplined
person. It is the same for parking spaces. It is not so hard for
me, but people with missing lower extremities find it very hard.''
   The French government still pays pensions to 239,000 injured
veterans, 135,400 widows and 46,700 civilian victims of the war.
Since the war's end, 2.5 million Frenchmen registered with the
Veterans' Ministry.
   French attitudes are complicated by factors beyond the war.
Germany's solid economy and brisk trade evoke a certain envy. The
West German mark, not the French franc, is Europe's hard currency.
   Well-heeled German tourists, like the Japanese, are sometimes
seen with the slightly jaundiced eye once turned on Americans.
   As West Germany slips away from its past reticence to dabble in
world politics, Bonn is jostling Paris as a center of power.
   In recent months, the French press has devoted pages upon pages
to issues lingering from '39-'45. The influential Paris daily Le
Monde carried a supplement on the literature of a new, friendly
Germany.
   Scholars stress the European long view of history. For many,
'39-'49 was World War III. Napoleon's march eastward from France
was first, unless one counts Charlemagne, a millenium earlier.
   Because of this, many Frenchmen see a significant change coming
with today's students, who have no experiences to bring life to
words on a page.
   Jean-Manuel Bourgois, director of Les Presses de la Cite
publishing house, was forbidden as a child to make German friends.
His 19-year-old daughter bears no hostility at all.
   ``When my kids hear their grandparents talk about what they
suffered in the war, it is as if they were listening to a serial on
television,'' he said. ``They don't see it as reality.''
   But even a generation change may not obliterate the past.
   Gilles Leon, 18, is a new European, studying English and Spanish
along with his native French.
   ``We are coming together with other Europeans, including the
Germans,'' he said. ``The war is past. But something about the
term, German, stays with us. I think that will never disappear.''

   A dawn raid on a sleepy priory tucked into the old
quarter of Nice ended more than 40 years on the run for France's
last known World War II criminal at large.
   The gaunt, pajama-clad old man taken away last May by police was
Paul Touvier _ alias Lacroix, alias Berthet, alias Gaillard _ the
former head of a pro-Nazi militia unit based in Lyon to hunt down
resistance fighters and Jews.
   Fifty years after war devastated Europe, Touvier's capture has
rewakened terrible memories of France's collaboration with cruel
and genocidal acts of its Nazi conquerers.
   It also spotlights the role of some Roman Catholics _ at first
in the church hierarchy and later among breakaway traditionalists _
in helping Touvier evade the law since 1944.
   If the 74-year-old Touvier lives long enough to face trial _ he
is suffering from prostate cancer _ cartons of his private papers
that he filed and took along everywhere he went during his 44 years
underground will be made public.
   ``The Touvier case will open old wounds because it will put the
militia on trial for the first time'' since immediately after the
Liberation, Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld said in an interview. ``For
the majority of French people, the war is part of the Middle Ages,
so the trial will set the record straight about the militia.''
   Touvier, who worked closely with Lyon Gestapo chief Klaus
Barbie, was arrested at the Liberation, but escaped from prison. He
was twice convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death in
absentia.
   Thanks to persistent lobbying on his behalf by Charles Duquaire,
private secretary to the archibishop of Lyon, Touvier was pardoned
quietly in 1971 by President Georges Pompidou.
   The president justified his action by asking: ``Is it not the
time to throw a veil over the times when the French didn't love
each other, and even killed each other?''
   Most Frenchman answered with a resounding ``No.'' New charges,
not covered by the pardon, were filed and Touvier went back into
hiding, slipping in and out of monasteries and religious retreats
throughout France, Italy and Switzerland _ even walking village
streets dressed in monk's robes.
   Fresh charges of crimes against humanity and an international
arrest warrant were filed in 1981. Touvier is accused of
responsibility for the execution of Jewish hostages and the murder
of Victor Basch, 81-year-old president of the League of Human
Rights, and Basch's wife, Helene.
   The current archbishop of Lyon, Albert Decourtray, decided to
open the local church archives to a panel of prominent lay
historians this fall to determine ``the attitude of the church, its
men and its communities in the Touvier affair.''
   ``I prefer the truth, even if it is unpleasant, to a pleasant
lie, because it is liberating,'' Decourtray said, adding it was
``probable that sanctions would be pronounced against those
clergymen who helped Touvier evade the law.''
   Klarsfeld has warned against confusing the entire church with
the smattering of right-wing Catholic traditionalists who sheltered
Touvier.
   ``We must emphasize the enormous, and sometimes unknown debt
Jews have towards the French Catholic Church,'' Klarsfeld wrote in
a commentary in the daily Le Monde.
   ``If three-quarters of France's Jewish community survived, it
was because of the solidarity and sympathy of the French people and
the churches of France,'' he wrote.
   Touvier was arrested in a dawn raid at the St. Francis priory,
which Nice city officials had made available to the traditionalist
followers of rebel Monsignor Marcel Lefebvre, who was
excommunicated by the Vatican last year.
   Though most reaction to Touvier's capture was favorable, the
leader of the extreme-right National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, said
he did not consider ``tracking down an old man a victory for human
rights.''
   ``During the war he belonged to the militia. So what? After 30
years, the wounds should be healed. Touvier did not endanger the
public order,'' Le Pen said.
   If Touvier does stand trial, he would be the first French
collaborator to be tried for crimes against humanity. Barbie,
brought back to France after a long South American exile, was
convicted of crimes against humanity in 1987 and sentenced to life
in prison.
   But prosecutions of other collaborators have dawdled, perhaps
not suprisingly in a country where elected government officials
cooperated with the Nazi occupiers and wrote and enforced
anti-Jewish laws resulting in the deportation and death of some
75,000 Jews.
   Maurice Papon, who was responsible for signing orders to deport
thousands of Jews from Bordeaux while he was secretary-general of
the Gironde prefecture between June 1942 and August 1944, has been
awaiting trial since he was charged with crimes against humanity in
1983.
   After the war, Papon served in many high-profile government
posts, including chief of police and budget minister under
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   Some historians believe evidence implicating other respected
personalities from post-war French society could be lying in dusty
archives, accessible only after long administrative paperwork.
   ``The Papon affair has had a chilling effect on archivists,''
American historian Robert Paxton, author of ``Vichy France,'' said
in a telephone interview.
   ``They may have had their knuckles rapped and they are now
treading lightly, reluctant to make public documents that might
cause problems for prominent public officials,'' Paxton said.
   French scholars, Paxton said, prefer to forge reputations
studying other subjects, ``a reaction, perhaps, to the disagreeable
reality of the Occupation.''

   What ever happened to the Witch, Dorothy and
the Scarecrow? Did their movie careers soar or plunge? Here's a
brief look at what became of the stars who brought such memorable
characters to the screen in ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
  Judy Garland became a full-fledged star as Dorothy. After
co-starring with Mickey Rooney in youth musicals, she went on to
other musical productions such as ``Meet Me in St. Louis,''
``Easter Parade'' and ``Summer Stock.'' She also did dramas such as
``The Clock.'' But because of her erratic behavior she was fired by
MGM. In 1951, she made a smashing comeback at New York's Palace
Theater and starred in a remake of ``A Star Is Born.'' But her
career never fully recovered. She died in London in 1969 of an
accidental barbiturate overdose.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
  Frank Morgan, who played the Wizard, continued under contract
to MGM, usually as a befuddled bumbler. He died in his sleep in
1949 after starting the role of Buffalo Bill in ``Annie Get Your
Gun.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Ray Bolger, the Scarecrow, returned to the stage for ``Where's
Charley?,'' which he also did on film. He made other film musicals
such as ``April in Paris'' and ``Babes in Toyland,'' and was active
in television. He died in 1987.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Cowardly Lion Bert Lahr also returned to the theater for
musical comedies as well as the existentialist ``Waiting for
Godot.'' He appeared in the films ``Rose Marie,'' ``The Second
Greatest Sex'' and ``The Night They Raided Minsky's.'' He died in
1968.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Jack Haley, the Tin Man, made a few films during the 1940s and
did a cameo role in ``Norwood'' in 1970, under the direction of his
son, Jack Jr. He died in 1979.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Lillie Burke, who played the good witch Glinda, continued her
specialty of dithering dowagers in ``The Man Who Came to Dinner,''
``Father of the Bride'' and other films. The widow of producer
Florenz Ziegfeld died in 1970 after a long illness.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Margaret Hamilton never achieved the same notoriety of her
Wicked Witch, but she remained a busy character actress in such
films as ``My Little Chickadee,'' ``State of the Union'' and
``Riding High.'' She became a familiar figure as Cora, the small
town shopkeeper of the Maxwell House coffee commercials. She died
in 1985.

<HEAD>David Dinkins: Mr. Mellow for Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He speaks carefully, quietly and with precise
diction. He is slow to criticize, slower to attack, temperate in
his positions. A calm and deliberative leader, friends say. Boring,
critics retort.
   The new Mr. New York?
   Could be. David Dinkins, avoiding the political pugilism that
made Edward I. Koch mayor, soon may walk off with Koch's job.
Should he win this year's election, Dinkins would be the city's
first black mayor _ and its most laid-back chief executive in a
long while.
   Consider his less-than-fiery rhetoric: ``I guess you think it's
best to just rifle off a thought without reflection,'' Dinkins
recently scolded Koch. ``It seems to me that reflection and
gathering of intelligence in order to make a judgment is highly
desirable.''
   That's a far cry from the sharp-tongued incumbent, whose
combative style has alternately charmed and offended his
constituents for a dozen years. As the prototypical brash New
Yorker, Koch has dominated city politics.
   But the city, beset by social problems from crime to drugs to
AIDS, may be ready for a more mellow approach: Polls say the
unassuming Dinkins, after one term as Manhattan borough president,
runs even with Koch and leads two other candidates in the race to
win the Sept. 12 Democratic primary.
   ``Ed is the quintessential hot candidate, and David provides the
perfect relief,'' said David Garth, Koch's political strategist.
``Dinkins' problem is whether he has a spark. Koch's problem is
that he's got too many sparks.''
   ``They say David Dinkins may be too nice of a guy. That's a hell
of a compliment,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., long a Koch
critic. ``Maybe New York has had enough of the damn political
reaction and overreactions.''
   If Koch faces voter disenchantment, Dinkins must confront his
own set of hurdles. Some critics question his qualifications and
his grasp of issues, and they raise his failure to pay taxes for
four years two decades ago.
   But Dinkins' greatest challenge, political tacticians say, is to
bridge racial tensions and assemble a coalition of voters _ blacks,
who comprise up to a third of the Democratic vote, whites and
Hispanics.
   ``David has got to walk a thin line between exciting the black
vote and inciting the white vote,'' said Steven Matthews, campaign
manager for mayoral candidate Harrison J. Goldin, the city
comptroller. ``Part of the difficulty is the perception, in the
political community at least, that the issues that concern black
voters and white voters are somewhat different.''
   If there are competing concerns _ Matthews suggested that white
voters are more worried about crime, blacks about social programs _
Dinkins' bland and conciliatory style may reassure wary voters.
``Instinctively, David reaches out,'' said Garth. ``It's a nice
quality.''
   Dinkins, for example, was co-director of Jesse Jackson's New
York state campaign in last year's Democratic presidential race _
but he has not brought Jackson into the city to speak for him this
year. Dinkins thus has avoided exposing the old wounds of some
black and Jewish voters, caused by Jackson's 1984 reference to New
York as ``Hymietown'' and Koch's claim that Jews ``have got to be
crazy'' to support Jackson.
   Instead Dinkins has stressed comity, even to the exclusion of
specific plans for the city's seemingly intractable problems. While
his opponents at a recent debate stressed police protection,
government corruption and failing schools, Dinkins took his own
tack:
   ``What is essential is that we strive hard to understand the
backgrounds and heritages of each other _ hopefully so as to come
one to love another, but if not to love one another, certainly to
understand one another,'' he said. ``With understanding will come
respect. The absence of respect, or disdain that some have for
others, is a large measure of our difficulty.''
   For Dinkins, such comments constitute an elliptical criticism of
Koch. ``Clearly the tone of civility,'' he said at another debate,
``is set or is not set at the highest levels of government at City
Hall.''
   The mayor attacks far more directly: He has accused Dinkins of
tax evasion for failing to file in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, and
questioned whether Dinkins can be trusted to manage the city's $26
billion budget.
   Dinkins has apologized for his tax ``procrastination,'' which
cost him an appointment as deputy mayor in 1973, noted that it
occurred long ago and pointed out that he was not charged with any
crime. But even his supporters concede the issue is a fair one for
opponents to raise.
   Critics have raised other matters, too, accusing Dinkins of
indecision and fiscal inexperience. He suggested easing
restrictions on public-employee strikes, then dropped the idea; he
suggested cutting the city sales tax, then backed off when reminded
that its proceeds are earmarked for bonds.
   But he largely has avoided controversy, running a leader's race,
racking up union and political endorsements, accentuating the
positive. ``It's the typical campaign of a front-runner,'' said
Matthews. ``It also happens to fit David perfectly.''
   Long an active Democrat, Dinkins, 62, rose to prominence only
recently, winning the borough presidency _ the job is equivalent to
a county executive _ in 1985 after two losing tries. He spent the
previous decade as city clerk and served one term in the state
Assembly in the mid-1960s.
   His own poor background, Dinkins has said, explains his concern
for social welfare. Born in Trenton, N.J., he came to New York with
his mother, a domestic, after his parents separated when he was 6.
He tells of selling shopping bags on the street, shining shoes,
washing dishes and cars and working his way through college and law
school. ``I can never remember not having a job,'' he said.
   Whether he will have the city's top job remains to be seen.
Dinkins would needs at least 40 percent of the primary vote to
avoid a runoff with the second-place finisher; he had just about 40
percent in recent polls, and has led in polls on a hypothetical
runoff against Koch.
   Should he win the nomination, Dinkins likely would face Rudolph
W. Giuliani, a former prosecutor who leads for the Republican
nomination, in November. Dinkins leads Giuliani in polls, and he
has a built-in advantage: Democrats outnumber Republicans by 5-1.
   An unknown factor is the extent to which some whites will refuse
to vote for a black candidate. ``Of course it's a concern. There
are members of ethnic groups who will never go for another,'' said
Rangel, who is black. But he said that does not apply to the
overwhelming majority of New Yorkers.
   Garth held a similar view: ``There are some racial overtones in
everything you do, but this is not a knee-jerk city on the racial
issue.''
   And Percy Sutton, a former borough president and the first
serious black candidate for mayor, in 1977, said Dinkins has the
qualities to overcome prejudice.
   ``In a city that is strident, David Dinkins has been a calming
voice,'' Sutton said. ``He is a person who brings people together.''

<HEAD>Congressional Pay Quandary Revisited</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's an ethics and pay quandary waiting for
Congress this fall _ and a session that began with the prospect of
a sharp salary increase could end in what amounts to a freeze.
   It wouldn't be the first. House and Senate salaries once were
stalled for 33 years after a pay increase bill that stirred a
political storm.
   James Madison saw it coming when the Founding Fathers were in
the process of creating Congress. At the constitutional convention
in 1787, he observed that to have members ``regulate their own
wages was an indecent thing and might in time prove a dangerous
one.''
   To review the current bidding, President Bush has offered to
``work with Congress'' on a pay raise to substitute for the
51-percent increase rejected last winter. That was six weeks ago,
when he also proposed legislation to phase out the speechmaking
honoraria members now can accept as outside income.
   The game plan in Congress has been to tie restrictions on
outside income to an increase in the $89,500-a-year salary members
now are paid, putting a spoonful of sugar with the ethics medicine.
   A bipartisan House task force is studying the issues, and
probably will suggest next month that Congress tighten its outside
income restrictions in tandem with a renewed pay raise measure.
   Even that formula leaves Democratic leaders wary that
Republicans might seize any raise as an issue against them, even an
increase endorsed by Bush. That's what happened on the 51-percent
raise, although President Ronald Reagan recommended the measure and
Bush agreed.
   GOP campaigners trying to shake the Democratic majority in the
House figure one way to do it is by working to create a backlash
against incumbents, most of whom are Democrats. And there's a long
record to demonstrate that there's no backlash like a congressional
pay backlash.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W. Va., recounted that record in one of
his lectures on congressional history, tracing pay hassles to the
current one _ and noting that it has revived a moribund,
200-year-old constitutional amendment that would delay the
effective date of any raise until after the next congressional
elections. Twenty-eight of the required 38 states have voted to
ratify the pay amendment.
   For its first 20 years, Congress paid its members at the rate of
$6 a day and $6 for every 20 miles traveled to get there and home
again. Byrd said that worked out to $900 or $1,000 a year in
congressional salaries.
   In 1816, Congress voted in an annual salary of $1,500, spurred
by purported reformers who argued that members were dragging out
speeches and thus sessions in order to collect higher pay at the
day rate. That produced an outcry and an issue that led to
wholesale defeat of incumbents, which prompted the survivors to
repeal it. They upped daily pay to $8, and it was frozen there for
38 years.
   The first annual salaries, of $3,000, were voted in 1856. In
1873, Congress voted to raise that to $7,500 _ and to make it
retroactive for two years. President Ulysses S. Grant signed it,
doubling his own pay in the process.
   That backlash was explosive, despite congressional arguments
with a familiar ring. Sen. Matthew Carpenter of Wisconsin said his
constituents didn't want him to live in a garret on crackers and
cheese and dress in goatskins. He said they knew that a bank
cashier or insurance company president couldn't be hired for less
than $10,000. ``They believe a senator ought to have as much brains
as a cashier of a bank or president of an insurance company,'' he
said.
   The ``salary grab'' was the dominant issue in the next election.
Carpenter was one of the casualties.
   That raise was repealed and it was 33 years before Congress
risked voting itself another one.
   It put salaries back at $7,500, where they stayed for the next
18 years. In 1925, the Senate boosted pay to $10,000 with a
late-night amendment, passed with no debate. The House agreed,
avoiding a roll call vote.
   Congress cut its pay during the Depression, restored it before
World War II, but didn't get another raise until 1946. In 1955,
amid an economic boom, Congress boosted its pay to $22,500, an
80-percent raise, with little political fallout.
   Maybe the secret is in the timing.

<TEXT>
   In the beginning, there were digital
computers. They were big, slow and very stupid. A half-century
later, digital computers are very small and fast, but they're still
hopeless idiots compared to humans.
   The main problem was, and still is, that computers just can't
think.
   But what if computer circuits could be made to resemble our
brains? What if they could learn from their mistakes?
   Hundreds of tiny companies have sprung up in the past three
years hoping to answer, and cash in on, those questions with an
approach called neural networks after the neurons that are the
basic structure of the human nervous system.
   Carlos Tapang, a 36-year-old Filipino physicist who left Intel
Corp. to start Syntonic Systems Inc., shipped what he believes is
the first commercially available neural network chip to
Electrodyne, a Japanese company, in May.
   The chip is called DENDROS-1, a reference to dendrites, the
highly branched filaments of nerve or brain cells that let the
cells communicate. It simulates neurons by combining a variety of
signals to come up with a single result.
   Tapang compares it to measuring the flow of water through a vast
network of different-sized pipes by emptying them into a single
pool. Such a system of computing values is called ``analog,'' which
implies a continuous form of measurement, like the sweep second
hand on a watch.
   Digital computers, like digital watches, chop time and numbers
into tiny bits and add them up one at a time. In fact, ``bits'' are
the smallest unit of information in the binary system that is the
``brain'' of a digital computer.
   The great advantage of today's digital computers is that they
can add those bits incredibly fast, even if it is done only one bit
at a time.
   There is some evidence from research on animals and people that
the neural cells in our brains use a kind of digital system to
transmit signals. These on-off pulses, called spikes, confused
early researchers and led some to believe that the brain relied on
a digital model to process information.
   Instead, they found it was only a tiny portion of a complex
electrochemical system that channels signals the way Tapang is
trying to imitate. ``A neuron by itself is dumb, but the totality
of that network of neurons in our skull is probably the most
intelligent machine in the universe,'' he said.
   The key word is ``network.'' It is the interaction of neurons in
our brains that gives rise to thought, not the action of a single
neuron.
   In that sense, Tapang said, digital computers are doomed to be
electronic dunces because their chips were designed to be solitary
devices called central processing units, channeling all operations
through one electronic ``pipe.''
   Even if CPUs are connected, the result is only a faster dunce.
   However, some computer scientists and industry analysts are
skeptical.
   Neural networks will ``be a fine addition to what we've got now
but they'll just supplement it,'' said Esther Dyson, editor and
publisher of Release 1.0, a New York-based computer newsletter.
``They'll never replace the mathematically precise logic of a
digital system.
   ``I fundamentally disagree with this `baited breath' attitude in
the industry about the next breakthrough being neural chips or
networks. They're good at things like pattern recognition but still
cannot cope with our kind of `fuzzy thinking.' A lawyer might ask,
`Colonel North, why did you do that?' and accept a fuzzy answer,
but a computer can't.''
   One San Jose, Calif.-based company, Synaptics, has used neural
network technology to develop what it calls a Silicon Retina. An
array of photo sensors emulates the light receptors in the eye, and
an analog computer processes the image for display on a video
monitor.
   Tapang uses capacitors to simulate neurons, which rely on
chemicals to transmit signals between synapses. Capacitors store
and release electricity in much the same way. DENDROS-1 has one
fixed connection and 22 variable ones that simulate synapses. It
can be layered with other chips to create an overlapping network of
communicating capacitors that ``fire'' signals to each other.
   As in the brain, the firing of one electronic neuron affects the
others. An important feature is each neuron's ability to damp its
neighbors, creating a pattern. The variable interaction is a
crucial part of the network.
   The applications for Tapang's chip include things like pattern
recognition.
   Dyson agrees the best uses for neural chips and networks would
be tasks like analyzing seismic patterns to predict earthquakes and
hunt for oil or gas, analyzing brain waves, identifying
fingerprints or other classification chores.
   But she remains skeptical about their potential. So does Dave
Waltz, of Thinking Machines Corp. in Cambridge, Mass., which makes
a supercomputer built of up to 64,000 digital processors harnessed
together.
   The problem with neural networks is that you can't keep
expanding them, Waltz said. ``The whole field of neuropsychology
says that increasing the scale means greater complexity. If you
scale up the size of a neural net you increase the complexity of
solving the problems you give it.''
   Mathematicians claim they can use mathematical functions to
achieve the same effect as neural networks, and such formulas can
be readily understood, he said. ``The main problem with neural
networks is that we just don't understand how they really work any
more than we understand how the brain really works.''
   Waltz believes the boom in neural network research will slow but
that interest will continue, because it is ``easier to write
programs for neural nets than for any other system. Almost anybody
can play the game.''
   ``The digital age is over and the analog era is here,'' Tapang
said. ``The next step is making computer chips that can communicate
with each other and this is a step in that direction.''

   Spike heels weren't made for walking,
according to a year-long study of high-heel shoes that gives a leg
up to flat footwear.
   Becky Snow, who studied heel heights because she ``needed a
thesis'' for a master's degree in physical education and exercise
science, found that pressure on the ball of a woman's foot
increases dramatically with higher shoes.
   Compared with going barefoot, a }-inch heel increases the peak
pressure 33 percent, a 2-inch heel increases it 53 percent and a
3\-inch heel increases it 76 percent, the University of California
biomechanicist said. Moreover, heels shorten the time a high-heeled
foot has to adjust to the higher pressures.
   The study doesn't prove high heels are unhealthy, but begs
further research into heels and posture, joint deterioration and
other foot ailments, she said.
   Keith Williams, a physical education professor and
biomechanicist who advised Snow in her research, said he hopes it
prompts the fashion industry to follow athletic-shoe makers by
designing footwear with physiology in mind.
   Williams, who has tried unsuccessfully to market dress shoes
that are ``more comfortable than beautiful,'' added, ``Maybe they
should require the shoe designers to walk in high-heel shoes.''
   Even if the industry is reluctant, said Dr. George Holmes, an
orthopedist at University Medical Center in Sacramento, studies
like Snow's will do for high-heel shoes what cancer research has
done for smoking.
   ``If you could come out with a series of papers and studies that
could demonstrate the deleterious effect of heels,'' Holmes said,
consumers ``eventually will realize what's happening.''
   The industry is shifting toward ``comfort shoes,'' said Margaret
Pennes of National Shoe Fair of America, a New York-based trade
group. ``What started to happen is a lot of people got involved in
walking and were wearing comfortable walking shoes. And they
started to look for the same comfort in heels.''
   Comfort heels incorporate technology from athletic and walking
shoes, changing such things as length, padding, and shape to lessen
pressure, Pennes said. ``So woman who do care about what their feet
are going to look like in 10 years have options they didn't have
before.
   ``The good thing about it is that looks are not being
compromised. It used to be that comfortable shoes would be nerdy.''
   Snow's study, to be presented this month at an Orthopedic Foot
and Ankle Society meeting, supports what Holmes and other doctors
have suspected _ that foot ailments, which afflict far more women
than men, may be caused by shoes.
   ``There's not a lot of quantitative information about what
happens when women wear high heels. There's a lot of anecdotal
information, but not scientific data to back up statements people
make,'' Williams said.
   While other research has measured stride length, force and heel
stability, Snow said a lack of techology prevented a study like
hers until recently.
   Snow, 28, used a machine called a pedobarograph _ invented in
England in 1976 and updated by a British bioengineer three years
ago for use with personal computers _ to analyze pressure on the
balls of the feet.
   The pedobarograph calculates foot pressure by measuring light
deflected by walking across a lit glass plate covered by opaque
plastic. The deflected light is recorded by a camera and translated
by computer into graphs.
   Snow, a certified athletic trainer who routinely wears running
shoes but sometimes dons 2-inch pumps for dressier occasions,
initially intended to study amputee runners, but switched because
of the difficulty finding enough people who run on artificial limbs
for a scientific study.
   To recruit high-heel wearers, after newspaper ads failed, she
went to the campus quad and listened for the ``click, click,
click'' of womens' heels. She convinced 45 women to give up two
lunch hours to walk across the pedobarograph barefoot and in each
of three heel heights _ }-inch, 2-inch and 3\-inch.
   A companion study of heels' effect on posture and gait involved
11 women who spend nine hours each in a battery of tests. In one,
they walked barefoot and in heels on a treadmill while cameras
recorded the movement of fluorescent dots on their backs, legs and
ankles; similar tests focused on changes in the spine, pelvis and
shoulders. That study proved inconclusive, Snow said.
   Even so, she said, ``In speaking with people about high heels,
or even in talking to my subjects afterwards if I see them on
campus, they'll say, `You know, I've stopped wearing high heels.' ''

<HEAD>Hummingbird Banders a Rare Breed</HEAD>

   Bill Coughenour's breed is rarer than
the Bachman sparrow, a tiny Ozarks songbird on the endangered
species list.
   Coughenour bands hummingbirds _ ruby-throated hummingbirds, to
be exact.
   Only 31 people are fully licensed by the federal government to
put numbered metal bands on the legs of the tiny, aerial acrobats.
Coughenour is among a few who have limited permits to work under
supervision of the ``master'' banders.
   ``I've banded about 350 hummingbirds in the three years I've
been licensed. I might end up banding 250 to 300 this year,'' said
Coughenour, 41, who learned to band from his great-uncle, Jim
Johnson, the only master in the state.
   Johnson, 85, of Holister, has banded some 2,000 hummingbirds
over the past 20 years, earning him the nickname ``The Hummingbird
Man.'' Coughenour's sister, Sarah Driver of Springfield, also bands
under his direction.
   ``There's millions of hummingbirds out there, and there's just
not enough of us banding,'' said Coughenour. ``The whole reason for
banding is to get information about birds and their habits,
particularly migration.''
   Coughenhour, a businessman who bands birds as a hobby, uses a
homemade nylon net trap, with a feeder filled with sugar water as
bait, to catch the ``hummers'' at his home in Nixa and at the
Springfield Nature Center.
   He then carefully weighs the birds _ most weigh about 3 grams,
the equivalent of three plastic sandwich bags _ and notes the sex,
approximate age and general condition. The whole process takes just
a few minutes.
   Seventeen species of hummingbirds are found in the United
States, but only the ruby-throated variety is common east of the
Great Plains.
   Hummingbirds are attracted to almost any plant with red
blossoms, and are easily drawn to feeders filled with one part
sugar to four parts water. Johnson said the ruby throats, named for
the male's brilliant red throat patch, consume up to a gallon of
sugar water a day at 10 feeders around his home each summer.
   The long-billed birds have a voracious appetite for sweet nectar
to fuel their supercharged metabolism. Hummingbirds' wings beat an
astounding 50 to 70 times a second as they hover and feed, but
speed up to 200 beats per second when they need to zip away at up
to 60 mph.
   Hummingbirds migrate long distances, including a 600-mile trip
non-stop across the Gulf of Mexico to spend the winter in South and
Central America. The birds can live five to eight years and return
each year to the same territory.
   ``I have found them to be just such friendly little rascals.
They are so curious,'' Johnson said. ``They have some kind of
personal reaction to humans. It's hard to describe, but once you
get to fooling with them, you realize they are very responsive
birds. You can really get to know them individually.''
   Making friends with a hummingbird is ``no trouble at all. All
you need is sugar water to get their attention. I have a standing
bet with people that if they have one to three hummingbirds at a
feeder, I can have one perching on my finger in 20 minutes. If you
get near the feeder and remain motionless, they'll perch right on
your finger as they feed. It's the darndest thing.''
   Coughenour, who gives public talks and banding exhibitions each
summer at the Springfield Nature Center, said, ``Many of the older
people remember a time when everyone had formal flower gardens and
people would sit outside in the summertime and really enjoy the
hummingbirds.
   ``Some people my age have never seen a hummingbird. When they
do, they're fascinated. It's a real joy, particularly with little
kids, to see the delight in their eyes when showing them such a
small, fragile creature.
   ``They are very, very beautiful to look at.''

<HEAD>American Cancer Society Uses Ads to Glamorize Sunscreens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In posters of bronzed sunworshippers, she's
sultry and he's hot, and both need to avoid ultraviolet rays if
they want to stay that way.
   In a broadcast and poster campaign launched last week, the
Cancer Society is using Sports Illustrated swimsuit models like
Cheryl Tiegs to convince teens that tanning is ``out'' and the
undamaged look is ``in.''
   Those who burn most easily and have the highest risk of skin
cancer are Caucasians with light hair and eyes, said Northwestern
University dermatologist Dr. June Robinson, head of the American
Cancer Society Skin Cancer Task Force.
   Teens, lured by bronzed bodies, also are more prone to risk
overexposure, Robinson said. ``We keep telling teen-agers to stay
out of the sun, but they don't listen. They want to look like
Sports Illustrated models.''
   ``Calling any of these Sports Illustrated swimsuit models a `10'
is no compliment,'' a breathy voice in the TV spot says as the
models whip back their hair and rub suntan lotion on their legs.
``They are definitely `15s' because when they're in the sun, each
of them uses a suncreen with at least a SPF of 15 as recommended by
the American Cancer Society to help rub out skin cancer.''
   Robinson and Stanley Tannenbaum, a Northwestern advertising
professor, launched the campaign to encourage use of lotions with a
Sun Protection Factor of 15 or greater. A sunscreen with SPF 15
enables the user to stay in the sun 15 times longer than without
sunscreen.
   Posters will be given to schools and health clubs on request; TV
and radio announcements were mailed to Chicago stations.
   The campaign was undertaken after the society found the
incidence of malignant melanoma, the most deadly of skin cancers,
growing at a rate of 3.4 percent a year _ faster than that of any
other cancer. It estimates half of all people who live to 65 will
have skin cancer at some time and predicts malignant melanoma will
kill 6,000 this year, often because of sun damage 20 years ago.
   Warning signs of melanoma are ragged-edged moles, uneven in
color and about the size of a pencil eraser. They increase in size,
bleed easily, and commonly appear on the backs of men and the legs
of women.

<HEAD>Prehistoric Blades Give Clue to Human Migration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ultra-sharp ``microblades'' that rival
some of the best modern cutting tools may provide a glimpse into
the lives of primitive people who wandered from Asia to the Pacific
Northwest eons ago.
   ``This is the sharpest thing there is,'' said Washington State
University archaeologist Robert E. Ackerman as he looked at drawers
of blades chipped from obsidian, a hard, volcanic glass, and chert,
a fine-grained, tough rock. ``This is sharper than any surgeon's
instrument.
   ``In fact, it is now being used in some eye surgery.''
   The abundance of microblades and the blocks from which they were
chipped across the Soviet Union and into Alaska are solid clues to
how primitive people wandered from Asia to the Pacific Northwest,
Ackerman said. ``These microblade cores are very distinctive, like
pottery,'' helping to identify the cultures of the people who made
them and the times in which they lived.
   Akerman and other researchers from around the world shared their
knowledge at a Circum-Pacific Prehistory Conference last week in
Seattle.
   While a number of theories support the creation of land bridge
as the Ice Age lowered ocean levels, the trail of blades show a
clear migration of people from 30,000 years ago to 12,000 years
ago, Ackerman says.
   Many of the blades were made of obsidian, a fine-grained
volcanic mineral available throughout the Pacific rim's ``ring of
fire.'' And because they will not decompose, the blades have left
researchers with unique timeline.

   The UAL Corp. board of directors said it was
``premature'' to make a decision on a $5.21 billion takeover bid
from Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis, but the unsolicited suitor
called the response encouraging.
   Industry analysts had predicted the parent of United Airlines
would reject the offer, but the board issued a brief statement
Wednesday night after a nearly six-hour meeting that neither
rejected nor accepted the billionaire's proposal for a negotiated
deal.
   The Chicago-based company said Davis set forth ``a highly
conditional proposal'' to buy the company for $240 a share. It was
the first time UAL disclosed the value of the offer, which would
total about $5.21 billion based on UAL's 21.7 million shares
outstanding. Industry analysts previously speculated the offer was
worth at least $200 a share.

   Yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell in
Wednesday's auction to the lowest level in nearly three years as
the government continued a series of debt auctions intended to
raise $44.5 billion this week.
   The average yield was 8.03 percent, down from 9.18 percent at

   It was the lowest rate since 10-year notes averaged 7.25 percent
on Nov. 5, 1986. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 8

   A total of $9.76 billion in notes was sold out of bids totaling
$18.68 billion.
   Wednesday's auction will be followed by the sale of $9.75
billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of $1,000 on

<HEAD>Anglo Group Proposes Trust To Oversee Farmers Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Anglo Group PLC has proposed setting
up a three-member voting trust to oversee Farmers Group Inc. as
part of its bid for BAT Industries PLC, an apparent move to thwart
U.S. insurance opposition.
   An Anglo Group subsidiary, Holyake Investments Ltd., has offered
$21.6 billion, none of it in cash, for the British tobacco,
financial services, retailing and paper conglomerate.
   The bid is being reviewed by U.S. insurance regulators because
BAT owns Farmers, the Los Angeles-based insurance company BAT
acquired late last year for $5.2 billion.
   Anglo Group said Wednesday in a letter to insurance
commissioners in the nine states where Farmers does busines it had
proposed three trustees for the voting trust that would hold
Farmers until its sale.
   Holyake _ made up of Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith,
British investor Jacob Rothschild, Australian investor Kerry Packer
and other investors _ has said it would sell Farmers if its BAT
acquisition goes through.
   The sale would be subject to the approval of the state insurance
commissioners, and under the proposal, the trustees would oversee
management of the company in the interim.
   Holyake has filed nine lawsuits seeking to take the bid's
insurance aspects away from state regulators and place them in
federal court.
   The three proposed trustees are Daniel J. Evans, a former U.S.
senator from Washington; Shirley M. Hufstedler, a lawyer and former
U.S. education secretary; and David M. Sherwood, former president
of the Prudential Insurance Co. of America and currently president
of the New York Insurance Exchange.
   ``The appointment of these individuals, completely independent
of Anglo and Holyake and any related parties, will serve to
underscore the independence we propose for Farmers,'' Anglo Group
Chairman Albert J. Dunlap said.
   Former U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon was quoted in
the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday as saying he is a potential
buyer for Farmers.
   Simon, who leads an independent investor group that has been
involved in several leveraged buyouts, also emerged as an equity
investor in the BAT bid.

   Unisys Corp., the nation's third-largest
computer manufacturer, has ordered a salary and hiring freeze in
the wake of a 67 percent profit decline, The Washington Post said
in Thursday editions.
   The newspaper quoted from an internal memo to managers from
Curtis A. Hessler, executive vice president and chief financial
officer, that said no salary increases could be granted for the
rest of the year, new hiring and most staff moves were being put on
hold, and travel costs in the second half of 1989 must be held to
75 percent of first-half travel costs.
   The Post did not say how it obtained the memo.
   Capital spending, research and development and administrative
expenses must be held to unspecified targets below existing
budgets, the memo reportedly said.
   ``Earnings have suffered very severely, both from competitive
pressures on pricing and an overall cost structure that is plainly
too large relative to our current and projected business volumes,''
the memo said, according to the Post.
   Last month, Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., reported earnings
of $53.6 million on revenues of $2.57 billion in the quarter ended
June 30, a 67 percent decline from earnings of $162.3 million on
revenues of $2.39 billion in the same quarter of 1988.
   Also in the quarter, defense business declined by about 50
percent from the previous year's level because three Unisys
divisions were barred from bidding on defense contracts after a
former executive and consultant pleaded guilty to conspiracy
charges in a Pentagon procurement scandal.
   The company laid off 2,100 employees earlier this year.

   The seeds sown by deregulation of the U.S.
airline industry are bearing fruit, as a renewed takeover frenzy
could bring a major reshaping of the business, experts say.
   Many industry watchers believe intense competition spawned by
the easing of regulations in 1978 has made some carriers highly
desirable properties and turned others into desperate seekers of
merger partners.
   The results are likely to be further consolidation, although a
number of experts don't expect ticket prices to jump radically as a
result in the near future.
   ``Things are exciting at this point,'' said Louis Marckesano, an
airline analyst for the investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia. ``Now we've seen the domino effect as it goes
through each of the (airlines).''
   Within the past week:
   _United Airlines parent UAL Corp. received a buyout proposal
from investor Marvin Davis, and troubled Pan Am Corp. indicated it
also might be interested in merging with UAL.
   _A Pittsburgh-based manufacturing company revealed it owned 6.6
percent of Midway Airlines and might consider a takeover of the
Chicago-based regional carrier.
   _An investor group completed its $4 billion buyout of Northwest
Airlines parent NWA Inc.
   _Frequently rumored takeover target USAir Group Inc. completed
its merger with Piedmont and separately sold a major stake to
``white knight'' investor Warren Buffett.
   The latest trend comes after a lull following an earlier merger
wave sparked by deregulation. That wave saw a severe consolidation
of the industry, as big carriers such as NWA, Texas Air Corp.,
Delta Air Lines Inc. and Trans World Airlines Inc. swallowed up
such airlines as People Express, Republic, Ozark and Western in
order to meet the competition of the newly wide open markets.
   Now, successful airlines such as Northwest and United have
become hot properties stalked by big-time investors, unions and
rival airlines.
   On the other hand, those considered victims of deregulation,
such as Pan Am and Eastern, have been forced to change course in
order to survive.
   Financially weak Pan Am, for example, has said it needs to merge
with another carrier to survive. The company unsuccessfully
proposed a merger with NWA, and Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett
said Wednesday the carrier would now consider making a bid for UAL.
   Eastern, rocked by a strike that forced it to seek bankruptcy
court protection, has undertaken a plan to reorganize as a smaller,
more efficient carrier. Eastern is owned by Texas Air.
   The takeover frenzy comes against a backdrop of increasingly
restive airline unions. Eastern Airlines pilots, Machinists union
members and flight attendants have entered the sixth month of a
strike, and there are rumblings of a possible walkout against
Northwest by its 5,000 pilots, who have been without a contract for
2{ years.
   The unions, dipping into their pension funds, also have jumped
on the takeover bandwagon. Pilots at United made a $4.5 billion bid
for the airline in early 1987 and recently indicated they remained
interested in some form of ownership. And the 20,000-member
Machinists union local at Northwest was one of the suitors for NWA.
   Would-be airline buyers must reckon with a government regulatory
policy that has so far proven more stringent under the Bush
administration than under the Reagan White House.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner has indicated the
government might not look kindly on airline buyouts that load up
the companies with new debt. For example, he has expressed concern
that the acquisition of NWA might have a ``substantial adverse
impact'' on NWA's financial structure, by among other things,
jacking up its debt to about $3.7 billion.
   Skinner also has warned that the government would closely
scrutinize the possible competitive impact of the sales of assets
such as routes.
   ``It looks as though we have a real secretary of transportation
now,'' said economist Alfred E. Kahn, former head of the defunct
Civil Aeronautics Board and widely regarded as the main architect
of airline deregulation. Kahn had been critical of what he saw as
an overly lenient policy toward mergers under the Reagan
administration.
   After the latest takeover wave, the industry could look
radically different and even more consolidated, analysts say.
   Marckesano said many mid-sized carriers such as Midway, which
compete with the majors and the tiny commuter lines, are facing
turbulent times and could be swallowed up.
   But consolidation isn't expected to raise fares, which have been
steadily rising in recent months amid strong passenger traffic and
may have peaked for the near term, analysts say.
   A rare summer air fare war broke out last week, as several major
carriers matched a weekend discount program begun by Continental
Airlines.
   ``Fares obviously had jumped very substantially ... The carriers
are clearly beginning to encounter resistance,'' Kahn said.

<HEAD>Parent Of Bonwit Teller, B. Altman Chains Files for Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bonwit Teller and B. Altman department store
chains and their parent company, L.J. Hooker Corp., have filed for
bankruptcy court protection, citing debt problems that caused
concern among the chains' suppliers.
   But several other Hooker subsidiaries were not included in the
filing late Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, a
company representative said.
   L.J. Hooker said it has retained the management firm Sigoloff
and Associates to run the company during the Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings. The firm has rehabilitated a number of troubled
companies, L.J. Hooker said.
   L.J. Hooker is a subsidiary of Hooker Corp., an Australian
company with major U.S. retail and real-estate development
interests. For several months the the parent company has
experienced severe financial problems, and in late July it said it
was turning its operations over to a court-appointed liquidator in
Australia.
   Hooker blamed its troubles on sluggish U.S. consumer spending,
high Australian interest rates and exchange rate fluctuations.
   In a statement Wednesday, Sanford Sigoloff of the management
firm said the bankruptcy filing would allow L.J. Hooker to
restructure and repay debts, which total about $1.2 billion.
Sigoloff is a former chairman of the Wickes Cos. Inc., a retailing
and manufacturing company.
   Hooker said the bankruptcy filing was prompted by the inability
to reach an agreement with lenders to refinance its unsecured debt.
   The statement said several Hooker developments, including Retail
Projects of South Carolina, and store chains, including Birmingham,
Ala.,-based Parisian Department Stores and Houston-based Sakowitz,
were not included in the bankruptcy filing.
   David McAdam of Sitrick and Company, a public relations firm
representing Hooker, said late Wednesday that it will be ``business
as usual'' for holdings that are part of the filing.
   ``They will continue to build or sell whatever it is they build
or sell,'' McAdam said. ``It just puts a freeze on all previous
creditors and gives the company breathing space to reorganize and
go forward.
   ``If they were nailing boards a week ago, they'll be nailing
boards tomorrow,'' he said.
   McAdam said employees will be paid as usual at Hooker
subsidiaries included in the bankruptcy filing.
   Sigoloff said it is unclear what steps will be taken in the
reorganization.
   ``It is important for everyone to understand that Chapter 11
does not mean we are going to close all of the operations of the
corporation or that all Hooker employees are going to lose their
jobs,'' Sigoloff said.
   ``Daily operations will continue as usual, stores will remain
open, and transactions which occur in the ordinary course of
business will go on just before the filing,'' he said.
   Under Chapter 11, a company obtains a federal court order that
frees it from the threat of creditors' lawsuits until it can
develop a plan to put its finances in order. While the
reorganization proceeds, the activities of management must be
approved by the court. The ultimate reorganization plan must be
accepted by a majority of the creditors.

<HEAD>UAL Corp. Says It's Too Early to Decide on Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis says he's
encouraged by UAL Corp.'s noncommittal response to his $5.21
billion takeover bid _ a move that apparently leaves the company
open to other offers.
   Following a special meeting Wednesday that lasted into the
night, the UAL board of directors said it was ``premature'' to make
a decision on what it called Davis' ``highly conditional proposal''
to buy the company for $240 a share.
   It was the first time UAL, the suburban Chicago-based parent of
United Airlines, disclosed the value of the offer, which would
total about $5.21 billion based on UAL's 21.7 million shares
outstanding.
   Davis responded with a brief statement through his company,
Davis Corp., that said, ``We were encouraged by the board's
response and look forward to meeting with the company and its
representatives as soon as possible.''
   Bids from other investors eyeing UAL are likely to follow,
analysts said.
   ``The overture has thrust the company into play, obviously, and
there's really no turning back,'' said Timothy Pettee, an airline
industry analyst with Merril Lynch Capital Markets. ``The company
has got to pursue some ... financial transaction that maintains the
current stock prices.''
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, UAL
stock surged $24.62{ to close at $243.87{ a share amid rumors that
Davis' bid was worth $240 a share. UAL shares have leaped more than
$100 in the past year.
   After a nearly six-hour meeting, the UAL board issued a short
statement Wednesday night saying it had determined that ``while it
was premature to make a decision as to whether a sale of the
company to Mr. Davis or any other party at the present time would
be appropriate, it was desirable to explore all possible financial
and strategic alternatives'' including remaining independent.
   ``It has always been and continues to be the desire of the board
to promote the long-term growth of United Airlines as a major U.S.
air carrier,'' UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said in the statement.
   Wolf said the board would take into account the interests of its
shareholders, customers and employees ``in any decisions on its
future operations, growth and ownership.''
   Spokesmen for Davis and UAL refused to elaborate on their
statements. They would not say whether a meeting had been arranged
between the parties or what the next step might be.
   UAL is an attractive takeover target because it owns 80 percent
of its 408-jet fleet, which can be sold to finance debt from a
takeover.
   The nation's second-largest carrier, behind American Airlines,
also has a vast route network in the Pacific, the world's
fastest-growing air-travel market.
   But Merrill Lynch's Pettee said Davis is not necessarily a
strong suitor.
   ``Davis is playing the stock market and he's playing it very
adroitly,'' Pettee said. ``He hasn't given any indication that he
is serious about taking over the company, judging by his actions
with NWA.''
   Davis, who owns a considerable portion of UAL stock, reaped $30
million on his unsuccessful attempt to takeover Northwest Airline's
parent, NWA Inc., earlier this year. A group led by Los Angeles
investor Alfred Checchi acquired NWA for $3.65 billion.
   One possible scenario for UAL, according to Wall Street
observers, is that management, employees and the company's largest
shareholder, Saul Steinberg, will join forces in a leveraged buyout.
   Steinberg and Wolf are longtime business associates and friends.

<HEAD>Procter &amp; Gamble Posts 22 Percent Jump in Quarter Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. today reported a 22.1
percent jump in its fourth-quarter profit as the costs of closing
and consolidating some operations were more than offset by income
gains from higher unit sales.
   For the three months ended June 30, the consumer products giant
said income rose to $171 million, or 99 cents a share, up from $140
million, or 82 cents a share, in the prior year's final quarter.
Sales grew 9.2 percent to $5.4 billion from $4.98 billion of a year
earlier.
   Investors reacted positively to Procter &amp; Gamble's results. The
stock surged $4.25 to $122.25 a share in early trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The quarterly income was reduced by an after-tax provision of
$78 million to cover the closing of a Chicago plant and some other
U.S. operating departments as part of P&amp;G's effort to consolidate
manufacturing operations.
   But profit from higher unit volumes in the fourth quarter
compared with the year before more than compensated for the
negative impact that the one-time costs had on earnings, the
company said.
   For the entire year, Procter &amp; Gamble earned $1.21 billion, or
$7.12 a share, an 18 percent gain from $1.02 billion, or $5.96 a
share, a year earlier. Sales rose 10.7 percent to $21.4 billion
from $19.34 billion.
   P&amp;G Chairman and Chief Executive John G. Smale and President
John E. Pepper said in a joint statement that they were
``reasonably pleased '' with the past year's results, while noting
that the long-term development of their businesses was more
important than a single year's performance.
   ``As we enter the 1990s, our objective is to build on the
momentum generated within the company during the past few years and
to rise to the challenge of the more highly competitive markets we
will face in the coming decade,'' the executives said in a news
release.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, makes and sells a wide
range of soaps, laundry detergents, cleaning agents, personal-care
products including pharmaceuticals, food and beverage items and
other products for commercial use.

   General Mills Inc. says its new Benefit meets
all the requirements of a breakfast cereal: You pour milk over the
flakes in a bowl and eat them with a spoon.
   But Procter &amp; Gamble Co. contends that Benefit, which General
Mills says has been shown to reduce cholesterol when used in a
low-fat diet, is actually a drug and should meet drug testing
requirements.
   P&amp;G, which sells over-the-counter medicines, has asked the Food
and Drug Administration to pull Benefit off the market, something
General Mills says it has no intention of doing.
   ``It's a cereal that's made from grain. It's consumed like a
cereal. It's no different from any other cereal that's on the
marketplace that contains soluble fiber and has the ability to
lower cholesterol,'' General Mills spokesman Craig Shulstad said
Wednesday.
   The FDA is reviewing Procter &amp; Gamble's June 8 request and is
expected to respond soon, said Chris Lecos, press officer for the
agency.
   Benefit contains oat bran, rice and psyllium, a grain grown
mainly in India. The outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber,
which has been shown to reduce cholesterol.
   Psyllium also is an ingredient in Cincinnati-based Procter &amp;
Gamble's Metamucil, a fiber laxative. P&amp;G had asked the FDA to
allow the company to make cholesterol-lowering claims for
Metamucil, but the agency said more tests were needed, company
spokesman Bill Dobson said.
   According to General Mills, which is based in the Minneapolis
suburb of Golden Valley, tests conducted in 1987 on men with
average and above-average cholesterol levels found that Benefit
reduced cholesterol levels an average of 9 percent when 2 ounces
were eaten daily as part of a low-fat diet.
   Benefit accounted for about two-thirds of the reduction, the
company said.
   The Benefit package touts the cereal's claims of reducing
cholesterol, a fatty substance that can build up in inner artery
walls. The deposits can narrow blood vessels, decrease the blood
flow and may lead to a heart attack or stroke.
   Kellogg Co. made a similar claim in 1984 when it linked
consumption of All-Bran, a high-fiber cereal, with reduction of
cancer risks.
   The FDA could have declared the cereal a drug, forcing Kellogg
to undergo lengthy procedures for drug approval. But FDA
Commissioner Dr. Frank Young said such action, which could have
entailed seizing All-Bran, would have been ridiculous.
   Instead, the agency decided to come up with a regulation that
would allow health claims on labels _ a process that is still under
way.
   P&amp;G _ which also makes toiletries, soap, detergents and other
household and food products _ claims General Mills is playing by a
different set of rules from drug manufacturers in being allowed to
make health claims without FDA approval.
   P&amp;G's Dobson said the company recently submitted to the FDA the
results of additional tests on the cholesterol-lowering effects of
Metamucil, and more tests may be required. An earlier study found
Metamucil reduced cholesterol about 15 percent, he said.
   Dobson said it's unfair for P&amp;G to have to substantiate its
cholesterol-lowering claims for Metamucil, while General Mills can
make the same claims for a food product without getting FDA
approval.
   General Mills, which also makes Cheerios and Wheaties cereals,
began distributing Benefit in Minneapolis-St. Paul and Milwaukee in
late April and early May.
   The company has expanded distribution to 28 percent of the
country, primarily in the Midwest, but has announced no plans on
expanding marketing nationally, Shulstad said.

   Some savers can expect less interest on their
deposits and families may soon find it a bit less expensive to buy
a home, as the government today begins spending $50 billion to
resolve the savings and loan crisis.
   President Bush signed legislation Wednesday committing American
taxpayers to an estimated $157 billion _ $600 for every man, woman
and child _ over the next 30 years to solve the nation's biggest
financial crisis since the Depression.
   ``We can and will preserve a safe, efficient and equitable
financial system for ourselves and ... for our kids,'' Bush said
before signing a bill providing money to cover more than $100
billion in S&amp;L losses over the past decade to speculative, and
often fraudulent, lending.
   The Treasury Department planned today to borrow the first $5
billion of a $20 billion downpayment to be made over the next seven
weeks to reduce an estimated $20 million in daily losses by
insolvent but still operating S&amp;Ls.
   L. William Seidman, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
and in charge of the day-to-day cleanup, said three-fourths of the
first $20 billion will be used to reduce interest rates being
offered by some shaky thrifts to attract deposits. Those rates are
expected to fall from 11 percent to 8 percent or 9 percent.
   That step alone, affecting an estimated $50 billion in high-rate
certificates of deposit held by savers, is expected to immediately
cut the daily losses by $2 million or $3 million, say Seidman and
private analysts.
   Most of the $50 billion in high-rate CDs have short durations _
30, 60 or 90 days. As they expire, savers can either withdraw their
deposits or roll them over at interest rates 2 to 3 percentage
points lower.
   To whatever extent there are withdrawals, the government will
use $15 billion of what it is borrowing this month and next at
interest rates of about 8 percent to replace the high-rate CDs and
sustain the institutions with enough cash to keep operating.
   Private analysts said they expect the infusion of lower-rate
government cash into the ailing S&amp;Ls to ripple throughout the
industry, putting downward pressure on rates for all deposits as
well as the rates borrowers pay for new home mortgages and other
loans.
   Those trying to buy homes also should benefit because the bill
pushes S&amp;Ls back into home mortgage lending and out of risky
investments such as speculative commercial real estate projects and
junk bonds.
   Thrifts will be required to raise the level of housing and
housing-related loans in their portfolios to 70 percent from 60
percent.
   Unresolved is whether the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency
created to close or merge 400 to 700 insolvent or marginally
solvent S&amp;Ls over the next 26 months, will unilaterally reduce
interest rates on high-rate, long-term CDs with durations up to 30
months.
   The trust corporation's predecessor, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, had honored those interest rates in taking over failed S&amp;Ls.
FDIC Director C.C. Hope Jr. said he expected a decision ``in the
next few days.''
   Whatever that decision, analysts said they expected the influx
of government cash into the troubled institutions _ about one-sixth
of the industry _ to ripple throughout the entire financial system.
   ``It will be a generational impact _ because people over 50 have
more cash and savings and people under 50 generally have more
debt,'' said Alex Sheshunoff, a private analyst.
   ``As interest rates come down, it's going to benefit borrowers
more than depositors,'' he said. ``The last chance to catch the
high-rate CD freight train was before 10:45 a.m. (Wednesday) when
Bush signed the bill.''
   Immediately upon Bush's signature, the Resolution Trust Corp.
authorized spending $215 million to liquidate or subsidize the
merger of three of 262 ailing thrifts the government has taken over
since February.
   Another $600 million was authorized for liquidations and mergers
over the next two weeks.
   Officials anticipate it will take 26 months and the expenditure
of all $50 billion provided in the legislation to stem the
industry's losses, assuming interest rates don't rise.
   Including interest on the money being borrowed to address the
crisis, the bailout will cost $159 billion over the next 10 years
and $285 billion _ $157 billion of it from taxpayers _ over 30
years, according to administration and congressional estimates.
   S&amp;L owners will be required to put up billions of dollars more
of their own money as a buffer between risky loans and the
government's deposit insurance funds ``so these problems will never
happen again,'' Bush said.

   Grain and soybean futures were mostly higher
early today on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders staked out
their positions or took to the sidelines ahead of an Agriculture
Department crop report.
   The report, scheduled for release in Washington at 3 p.m. EDT,
will doubtless project substantially larger corn and soybean
harvests than last year, when drought cut deeply into the crops.
   The early gains in the soybean market also reflected perceptions
that the Soviet Union recently bought soybean meal from Brazil,
analysts said.
   Some soybean buying also was linked to worries about the
relatively dry weather so far this month in the Midwest, where
soybean pollination is well under way and weekly showers are needed
to keep the process moving along.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.95{ a bushel; corn was
{ cent to 1} cents higher with September at $2.24} a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 1{ cents higher with September at $1.37{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2 cents to 8 cents higher with August at $6.02 a
bushel.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 6th graf pvs, `Days' sales ...,' with 2 grafs to include
1984 purchase price and size of hotel chain.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A unit of Reliance Group Holdings Inc. said it
has agreed to sell Atlanta-based Days Inns Corp. to the hotel
chain's largest franchise, Tollman-Hundley hotels.
   Under terms of the deal, Tollman-Hundley would pay $90 million
in cash and assume $675 million in debt.
   Brian T. Martin, a spokesman for Reliance Group Holdings, owner
of the limited partnership Reliance Capital Group, said Wednesday
that all that remains to close the deal is for Tollman-Hundley to
arrange financing.
   ``We have a willing buyer and a willing seller,'' Martin said.
``Assuming financing, there is every reason to believe the deal
will go forward.''
   Michael A. Leven, Days' president and chief operating officer,
had said several months ago that the company was for sale. He noted
that the business of Reliance, whose chairman is Wall Street
financier Saul Steinberg, is investments, not hotel operating.
   Days' sales last year amounted to $1 billion. The chain operates
858 hotels and has 522 others under construction.
   Reliance bought the chain in 1984 from the Cecil B. Day family
for $615 million.
   Leven said Wednesday that Monty D. Hundley, a partner of
Tollman-Hundley, assured him that Days' headquarters would remain
in Atlanta with the company's entire management team intact.
   ``He asked me if I'd stay and I said only if we stayed in
Atlanta,'' Leven said. Hundley is largely responsible for Leven
being named Days' president.
   Shortly after Reliance acquired Days in 1984, Hundley
recommended Leven for the job. The two men were introduced by a
mutual business acquaintance. Leven was hired by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Henry A. Silverman, who is also president of
Reliance Capital.
   Leven said Silverman would stay with Reliance and resign from
Days.
   He said he was confident that financing would be arranged. He
said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York is serving as
Tollman-Hundley's investment banker.
   ``They are hotel people very committed to the Days Inn system,''
Leven said of Tollman-Hundley. ``I feel that if this purchase goes
through, it will remove once and for all the spectre of being sold.
We will be able to continue the direction of the company without
the fear of a new owner coming in and changing things.''
   ``We just want to see them do more of the same,'' said Hundley.
``The people running the company are doing a heck of a job, and
we'd like to see them continue.''
   Drexel next week would review the terms of the proposed
transaction. If the firm approves, it would then line up financing.
Usually the process takes 30 to 60 days.
   Tollman-Hundley owns 129 hotels, including 48 Days Inns.

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco's Tobacco Unit Cutting 1,600 Jobs</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. will cut
1,640 jobs as part of a restructuring of the company's North
Carolina operations, an executive of the RJR Nabisco Inc. division
announced Thursday.
   ``We're adjusting our size and changing our structure to match
today's level of business and become a stronger, more competitive
company,'' said R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Chairman James Johnston.
``These have been difficult and painful decisions.''
   Of the layoffs, 825 are salaried and 700 are hourly, while
another 115 are temporary and part-time positions. The company said
employees would be notified Thursday.
   ``The U.S. tobacco industry has been experiencing a slow decline
for several years,'' Johnston said. ``In our case, consumer market
share has been declining gradually and our cigarette production has
exceeded consumer sales.''
   Regular and full-time employees will receive severance pay and
continued benefits for at least eight months. Most salaried
employees will be released immediately, although some will remain
for several months to allow for an orderly transition, Johnston
said. Most hourly employees will be released from mid-August
through mid-October.
   Employees who are 50 and older and whose age and years of
service total 70 or more will be eligible for immediate, unreduced
retirement benefits.
   After the layoffs, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco will have 12,500
employees, including just under 10,000 in its Winston-Salem-area
operation.
   The Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company also is reducing the
number of outside contractors, mainly computer programmers, by 140.
   Its corporate parent, RJR Nabisco, has been in the process of
streamlining its operations since it was bought out for $25 billion
last year by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 9th graf to clarify that telemarketing fraud excluded in
Visa's figure</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic in AP Access under CARDFRAUD</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The smooth voice on the telephone offered Juliet Zucker
something she really needed: a chance to get away on a summer break
at a bargain price if she would just give the caller her Visa
credit-card number.
   ``I was a little stir crazy and thought this would be a nice
thing to do,'' recalled Zucker, a Washington research analyst on
maternity leave, who put aside lurking suspicions about the $350
package. She gave her account number to the caller, then got her
suitcases ready. The bill came but the trip didn't.
   Zucker was taken by what's known as telemarketing fraud, one of
several gimmicks used by sophisticated thieves who prey on the
multibillion dollar credit-card industry. Their tools to falsify,
duplicate and deceive range from purloined credit-card receipts to
microwave ovens used to alter stolen cards.
   The victims bear little or no financial liability if they report
frauds promptly. But their credit ratings may be tainted until the
frauds are detected. The credit-card industry says all users are
indirect victims because the cost of fraud is passed on via higher
credit-card interest rates for everyone.
   The industry has combatted a counterfeiting problem with some
success in the United States by making cards harder to duplicate.
Nonetheless it still faces steady losses through phony customer
applications, doctored cards and the ``boiler-room'' schemes like
the one that ruined Zucker's vacation plans.
   ``Every time we close a door they're working on the other doors
to see if they're open,'' said Richard Ward, special agent in
charge of the New York field office of the Secret Service, which
has jurisdiction over crimes involving credit cards. ``It never
seems to stop.''
   For the first half of this year, the Secret Service said it made
760 credit card-related arrests and estimates industrywide losses
from those cases at $89.7 million. Last year it made 1,846 arrests
and put losses at $189.1 million, up from 1,620 arrests in 1987 and
$27.4 million in losses.
   While the statistics show progress in enforcement, major credit
card companies and credit reporting agencies say many more
hucksters _ from common thieves to foreign-based crime rings _
remain busy filching fortunes.
   Industrywide credit-card losses are difficult to assess. Visa
International, the largest bank credit-card issuer, said it lost
$188.8 million worldwide last year, telemarketing fraud excluded,
accounting for 0.09 percent of its total volume.
   That was up from $166.1 million the previous year, although down
slightly in volume, from 0.10 percent. In 1983, the year before the
Secret Service took over enforcement of revised federal credit-card
laws, Visa lost $101.7 million, or 0.15 percent of total volume.
   MasterCard International Inc. said worldwide losses totaled
$128.67 million in 1988, telemarketing fraud excluded, or 0.10
percent of volume, up from $98.9 million, or 0.09 percent in 1987.
Six years ago losses totaled $65.5 million, or 0.13 percent of
volume.
   American Express Co., another leading issuer of plastic, doesn't
release figures on fraud-related losses.
   Some experts say that besides Christmas, the summer-fall
vacation season is the busiest time of year for credit-card
thieves, who find that naive travelers make the easiest targets.
   ``A lot occurs outside the United States in locations where
travel is frequent,'' said Joel S. Lisker, vice president of
security and fraud control at MasterCard.
   Lisker said the Asia-Pacific region has replaced France and
Spain as a growing problem area, with card counterfeiting and
alterations by street gangs accounting for nearly half of the total
fraud losses reported there.
   In a common fraud case here and abroad, a thief will steal an
unsuspecting tourist's credit card, then charge the maximum amount
allowed before the victim reports the card missing, said William D.
Neumann, a senior vice president of security and risk management at
Visa.
   A stolen card also can be altered _ and later used _ by filing
or melting the account number in a microwave oven and re-embossing
it with a legitimate number. This could come from dishonest
merchants or thieves who rifle trash cans outside a store or
restaurant for discarded credit-card receipts.
   Some dishonest merchants accept what are known as ``white
cards,'' or plain plastic embassed with legitimate names and
numbers that give the appearance of a legal transaction when passed
through a credit-card machine.
   Ward said a growing threat is the more sophisticated thief who
files fraudulent credit-card applications with a smathering of
legitimate information. In many cases, that information comes from
criminals who take jobs as janitors or security guards in order to
steal personnel records, he said.
   Legitimate information can also come from telemarketing cons
that include claims of low-cost travel club memberships or
sweepstake contests, he said.
   In the case of Zucker, con artists claimed to represent a
Chicago travel agent in a promotional deal offered to Visa card
members. It took months for Zucker to realize the scam, because
before she paid the bill, she received mailed information on travel
destinations to choose from in the next year.
   Zucker is among the lucky. Some hucksters use the numbers
received over the phone to charge up a storm, as well as apply for
new credit cards.
   ``The other day some guy ordered an $8,000 watch over the phone
and charged it to his credit card,'' Ward said. ``What made it
suspicious was the guy was from the Bronx (N.Y) and the store was
in some small town in Maryland.''
   Under laws designed to protect cardholders, they are liable for
up to $50 of unauthorized purchases before reporting a card missing.
   Because credit-card frauds are becoming more sophisticated, the
card companies are concocting new anti-fraud devices that expand on
the introduction of hard-to-duplicate magnetic patterns placed on
cards in the early 1980s.
   Visa, for example, has introduced an optional security device
that will add more information to the magnetic strips that will
verify a card isn't phony. MasterCard said it will introduce the
same optional feature within the next few months, along with
harder-to-erase embossed numbers.
   The two credit-card giants also have established a special
computerized clearinghouse in Chicago to screen applications. About
70 percent of all U.S. card application volume is processed there,
Lisker said.
   He said the clearinghouse checks data and alerts members when a
name, address, or Social Security numbers are used repeatedly,
thwarting possible fraudulent applications.

<HEAD>Two Former Shuwa Employees Allege Abuse at Hands of Execs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former employees of Shuwa Investments
Corp. accused executives of the huge real estate unit of Japan's
Shuwa Corp. of beating and verbally abusing them and sexually
harassing one of them.
   Accountant Hajime Tanioka alleged in a Superior Court suit filed
last week and amended Wednesday that he was repeatedly assaulted by
Executive Vice President Takeshi Shiratori and President Takaji
Kobayashi of the Los Angeles-based firm.
   Tanioka alleges that Kobayashi, son of the parent company's
founder, struck him with a telephone and calculator, punched him in
the stomach and threw a set of keys at him when Kobayashi learned
that Tanioka was seeing a former employee.
   Tanioka further alleges that Kobayashi also struck him on the
head with a book while the accountant was recovering from an eye
injury after Tanioka refused to work overtime.
   The suit also alleges that Shiratori hit the accountant with a
ruler and rolled up newspapers and magazines. Tanioka left the firm
in 1987, said his attorney, J. Patrick Maginnis.
   In a suit filed late last year in Superior Court, a former
company secretary says she was assaulted and sexually harassed by
Vice President Kiichiro Kobayashi, the cousin of Takaji Kobayashi.
   Dawn Marie Stover alleges that Kiirchiro Kobayashi fondled and
ogled her and made sexual suggestions. The suit also alleges that
Kiichiro Kobayashi hit, slapped, pinched and struck Ms. Stover with
rulers and other objects.
   Kiichiro Kobayashi denied the allegations in Stover's suit and
in turn accused her of beating him and berating him with derogatory
and racist epithets. Ms. Stover quit in 1988.
   Shuwa Investments lawyer Craig B. Jorgensen said he had not seen
the suit against Tanioka, but added, ``We expect to deny the
charges and defend it vigorously.''
   Takaji Kobayashi declined to comment. Kiichiro Kobayashi and
Shiratori did not return telephone messages.
   Shuwa Investments has bought large, well-known commercial
properties in the United States, including the Arco Towers in Los
Angeles, the ABC Building in New York and the former U.S. News &amp;
World Report headquarters in Washington.

<HEAD>200 Congressmen Write Baker About BAT Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 members of Congress have signed
a letter urging Secretary of State James A. Baker III to express
U.S. concerns about the hostile takeover bid for BAT Industries PLC
and its American subsidiary to the British government.
   London-based BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, also has
significant interests in financial services, paper and retailing _
including such U.S. holdings as the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall
Field department stores and Farmers Insurance Group.
   ``Thousands of communities across America will be hurt by this
hostile bid,'' according to the letter to Baker.
   The letter, disclosed today by Kentucky's two senators, Mitch
McConnell and Wendell Ford, said the congressmen were ``deeply
concerned'' about the bid which said would eventually ``dismantle a
company that is important to hundreds of U.S. communities.''
   Last month, Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, British
merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and Australian investor Kerry
Packer and other investors made an offer for BAT valued at some
$21.6 billion.
   Among those participating in the cashless offer by Hoylake
Investments Ltd, which would be Europe's largest to date, is former
U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon.
   Simon reportedly may be interested in buying BAT's Farmer's
Group Inc. insurance division.
   The congressional letter noted that BAT's U.S. subsidiary ``its
55,000 employees and millions of insurance policy holders are being
put at considerable risk in a deal that will personally net
Goldsmith, Rothschild, Packer and their advisers over $5 billion.''

<HEAD>Shell Posts 60 Percent Profit Jump, BP Reports 34 Percent Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies and
British Petroleum Co. PLC reported sharply higher second-quarter
profits Thursday due to higher crude oil prices and gains in
refining and petrochemicals.
   Royal Dutch-Shell, based in The Hague, the Netherlands, and in
London, said its after-tax profit soared 60 percent to 1.01 billion
pounds, or $1.65 billion, from 633 million pounds, or $1.03
billion, in the same period a year ago. Royal Dutch-Shell does not
give consolidated per share figures.
   Revenue in the three-month period totaled 16 billion pounds, up
18 percent from 13.6 billion pounds in the comparable 1988 period.
   London-based British Petroleum, which owns Cleveland-based
Standard Oil Co., said its second-quarter net income rose 34
percent to 477 million pounds, or 9 pence _ 15 cents _ a share,
compared with 357 million pounds, or 5.9 pence _ 10 cents _ a
share, in the same period a year ago.
   Revenue rose about 15 percent to 7.39 billion pounds from 6.45
billion pounds.
   Both companies' financial statements are based on British
accounting methods and cannot be directly compared to those of most
American companies. Inventories are valued on the basis of first in
first out (FIFO), instead of the typical American system of last in
first out (LIFO).
   The companies call earnings calculated by the FIFO method
historical cost earnings. Those calculated by the LIFO method are
called ``current cost'' results.
   On a current cost basis, Royal Dutch-Shell's net income rose 38
percent to 912 million pounds from 660 million pounds.
   Earnings per share for Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., the Dutch arm
which controls 60 percent of the company, amounted to 4.22
guilders, or $1.98, compared with 2.65 guilders, or $1.24.
   Per-share earnings for Shell Transport and Trading Co. PLC, the
British arm which controls 40 percent of the group, rose to 11.1
pence a share from 7 pence a share.
   The companies attributed the gains to higher crude oil prices, a
more favorable dollar exchange rate and improved refining margins.
   For the first six months of the year, Royal Dutch Shell's net
income rose 57 percent to 2.29 billion pounds from 1.46 billion
pounds in the first half of last year.
   On a current cost basis, first-half earnings came to 2.02
billion pounds, up 29.5 percent from 1.56 billion pounds.
   Revenue in the first six months totaled 30.3 billion pounds, an
11.4 percent gain from 27.2 billion pounds a year earlier.
   On the current cost basis, British Petroleum's net income rose
15 percent to 371 million pounds from 323 million pounds.
   For the first six months of the year, British Petroleum said its
net income spurted 76 percent to 1.09 billion pounds, or 19.3 pence
a share, from 620 million pounds, or 10.3 pence a share, in the
comparable period a year ago.
   Current cost earnings came to 752 million pounds, up 3 percent
from 731 million pounds.
   BP's first-half revenue rose 9 percent to 14 billion pounds from
12.9 billion pounds a year ago.

<HEAD>Public Reaction to S&amp;L Bailout Ranges From Anger To Apathy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The costly federal bailout of the beleaguered thrift industry
has provoked everything from anger to ambivalence from the American
public, although many depositors say their confidence in the
soundness of the nation's banking system remains virtually unshaken.
   ``Every individual who has money in a savings and loan has to be
aware that (the government) insures the money ... and the comfort
level that the savers should have is directly related to the
comfort they have with the federal government,'' said Ronald Hyde,
who keeps checking and savings accounts with thrifts in the Phoenix
area.
   Echoing the sentiments of a number of Americans, Hyde said he
approved of the long-awaited thrift industry rescue plan that
President Bush signed into law on Wednesday, but called the cost
for carrying it out ``shocking at the very least.''
   The landmark legislation will require the government to spend a
whopping $285 billion over the next 30 years, more than half of
that from taxpayers, to close or dispose of money-losing thrifts.
   It is the most expensive industry rescue in history and some
experts say it will cost each American taxpayer at least $1,500.
   A spot check by The Associated Press of depositors in cities
nationwide suggested widespread resentment that taxpayers must pay
for the industry's problems. Most of the thrifts' problems can be
traced to the early 1980s when the industry was deregulated,
permitting S&amp;Ls to enter a broad array of new, riskier businesses.
   ``I think it stinks,'' said Ramiro Salazar, a 55-year-old mail
carrier from the Los Angeles area. ``How could they let it (the
thrift problem) get so out of hand?''
   ``This should not have happened,'' said John McGirk, a computer
technician in New York. ``The regulators knew this was coming and
they should have done something about it before making us pay for
it.''
   But Simone Hyams, of Tucson, said that ``maybe by helping the
S&amp;Ls get back on their feet, that will help the economy. I'm glad
that the government is interfering.''
   Some depositors said they didn't believe the bailout mattered
one way or the other.
   ``I'm really not that familiar with it to say,'' said Barbara
Sawyer of Baltimore, a customer of Baltimore Federal Financial.
``Hopefully it won't affect me.''
   In Texas, where much of the industry's problems have occurred,
many thrift depositors admitted only a vague awareness of the
bailout and its potential impact.
   Most S&amp;L depositors questioned by the AP said they wouldn't rush
to withdraw their money because the federal government insures all
thrift deposits up to $100,000.
   A recent survey of despositors by Sheshunoff &amp; Co., an
independent research firm that follows the banking industry, also
found that only 9 percent had withdrawn their money as a result of
the widely publicized problems of financial institutions.
   Salazar, who keeps $10,000 invested in a certificate of deposit
at Coast Savings &amp; Loan Association in Los Angeles, said that if
the bailout causes thrift interest rates to fall, as many expects
predict, he'll probably transfer money to his credit union.
   ``They're basically paying the same (interest),'' he said. ``But
the credit union seems a little more stable.''
   Roger Middleton, who banks at Miami Savings &amp; Loan, said he'd
also consider pulling his money out of the Florida thrift if rates
went down but he's not sure where he'd go.
   ``For the average bank customer, a bank or S&amp;L is the only
place,'' Middleton said. ``They (most investors) don't have big
chunks of money they can work with, and investments safer than
money market accounts and savings accounts are hard to find.''
   Many ailing S&amp;Ls paid premium rates on things like certificates
of deposits to attract funds and some healthy institutions matched
them to remain competitive.

   Share prices fell on London's Stock Exchange
Thursday, as buying interest waned.
   The market started weaker but recovered momentum around midday
after a batch of supportive earnings reports and speculative buying
interest on a handful of stocks.
   However, fear that Wall Street would open weaker deterred
investors and encouraged some profit-taking. The descent was
accentuated by market makers trimming prices in an effort to spark
buying interest.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended down
13.1 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,347.3.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed down 10.6 points at
1,961.4. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 6.99 points to
close at 1,322.93.
   Volume came to a fairly buoyant 574.5 million shares, up from
520.9 million shares Wednesday.
   By London's close, the Dow Jones industrial average had
recovered from opening lows and was up 1.89 points at 2,687.97.

<HEAD>LTV's Divestitures Send Earnings Down 75.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Corp., three years into one of the nation's
largest bankruptcies, said Thursday its second-quarter earnings
fell 75.5 percent, in part because of allowances for discontinued
steel and aircraft operations.
   The steelmaker and defense contractor reported that its net
profit for the quarter ended June 30 dropped to $30.3 million, or
18 cents a share, from $123.9 million, or 89 cents a share, in the
same quarter last year.
   Second-quarter revenue tumbled to $1.66 billion from $2.06
billion a year earlier.
   LTV said the revenue decline reflects the June 1988 sale of its
Warren, Ohio, steel plant and exclusion of 1989 results for the
steel bar division, which is to be sold.
   The company blamed its earnings decline on a $50 million charge
for estimated cost increases in various aircraft components, a
$43.7 million decline in steel operating income because of the
reduction of those operations, and a $30 million special charge for
canceling construction of a flexible composite center for
production of advanced aircraft components.
   The 1988 second quarter included a $30 million special charge
for costs of discontinuing medium and heavy military truck business.
   ``The major disappointment of the (latest) quarter was a loss
reported for LTV's aircraft products group, caused primarily by $50
million of charges related to performance on commercial aircraft
programs and projected cost increases in fixed-price development
programs for military aircraft,'' said LTV Chairman Raymond A. Hay.
   For the first half of the year, net profit was $106.9 million,
or 73 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $2.01 billion a
year earlier.
   First-half sales fell to $3.28 billion from $3.94 billion a year
earlier.
   The 1988 first half included a $2.26 billion charge because of a
change in accounting for pension fund obligations.
   LTV said Wednesday it had reached agreement with its major
private creditor over the size of its claim against LTV.
   LTV said Cyprus Minerals Co., a mining company based in Denver,
had agreed that it had a $505 million claim against LTV instead of
the original $1.7 billion it was seeking.
   The size of the claim will be used in determining how Cyprus
Minerals will share in the proceeds from the bankruptcy proceeding.
   The government agency which insures pension funds has the
largest outstanding claim against LTV, claiming that the company
owes more than $2 billion for three underfunded pension funds.
   LTV, which has been under bankruptcy protection for three years,
has until Nov. 8 to propose a reorganization plan.

<HEAD>Pilot Crossovers Increase After Leadership Discusses Ending Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trickle of picket-line crossovers has become a
steady stream since the Eastern Airlines pilots' leadership
discussed ending their 5-month-old strike, sources said Thursday,
boosting management efforts to rebuild without the unions.
   In meetings beginning Sunday, striking pilots resoundingly
rejected proposals to go back to work. However, sources who didn't
want to be identified said the number of pilots crossing the picket
lines neared 600, up from 200 at the strike's beginning on March 4
and from 385 a week ago.
   Pilots union spokesman Ron Cole said that number ``sounds
inflated,'' but he agreed crossovers have increased.
   ``I wouldn't call it dissension (in the union),'' Cole said. ``I
think people are making their individual choices based on economic
hardships after being on strike 5{ months.''
   Cole suggested that the returning pilots won't work well with
newly hired pilots, mixing newly returned veterans with recruits
will cause safety problems, and that many recruits will leave
Eastern because they are losing company-promised rapid advancement
to the veterans.
   Sources familiar with the pilots returning to work this week
said some have expressed disaffection with the union leadership and
belief the strike has been doomed.
   The leadership of Eastern's Air Line Pilots Association met
Thursday in Washington to discuss strategy and review the series of
overwhelming votes this week for continuing the strike.
   Company spokesman Robin Matell said Eastern has stopped
releasing the number of crossovers.
   ``We just decided not to go with a daily box score, as a company
policy decision during a period of meetings the pilots have held
around the country,'' Matell said. ``There are a number of pilots
returning, but we really would like to see how things shake out in
the next several days.''
   Matell added there's no question Eastern is well on track to
meeting its goal of 1,700 pilots by year's end.
   The company has said it has graduated some 300 newly hired
pilots from training and has nearly 800 pilots in training, which
lasts six to eight weeks.
   Machinists union leader Charles Bryan declined comment Thursday
on the pilots' situation. Earlier this week, Machinists senior
general chairman Wally Haber called the pilots ``the backbone of
the strike.''
   The pilots' solidarity with the Machinists, who struck after 18
months of federal mediation, stunned Eastern management, which
hoped to keep flying without the Machinists. With only 200 of the
3,600 pilots flying, Eastern struggled to fly 10 percent of its
pre-strike schedule of nearly 1,100 flights daily and filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization March 9.
   A rebuilding plan proposed to Eastern's creditors envisions an
airline two-thirds its pre-strike size flying 800 daily flights.
Eastern expects to increase its daily schedule from 350 to 390
flights on Aug. 15, and reach 800 by year's end. Eastern had to
lease planes and pilot crews from sister carrier Continental
Airlines this month.
   The unions, including striking flight attendants, predicted
Eastern couldn't rebuild without them and are backing a buyout bid
by Chicago businessman Joseph Ritchie, which has been spurned by
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.
   However, local and national pilots union leaders last week
raised the possibility of ending the strike as a way to protect
jobs and union strength. Most members reacted bitterly to the
suggestion, after months of pledges never again to work for Texas
Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   ``The troops are very, very upset. The Eastern pilots are
absolutely livid about the thought of going back to work,'' said a
pilots union activist who asked not to be identified.
   Eastern ALPA Chairman Jack Bavis reportedly told his members in
Miami Sunday night they should consider ending the strike.
   ``If he (Bavis) is advocating capitulation in any way, he is
representing a distinct minority view,'' said John Anderson, an
ALPA spokesman in New York. ``There aren't that many jobs to go
back to if we capitulate to Frank Lorenzo. We'd be going back to
unsafe cockpits.''
   Eastern says it wouldn't have jobs for all the striking pilots
if they returned because it won't lay off the newly hired pilots.
Union officials have indicated they believe pilots returning from a
strike must be given their jobs back over recruits still in
training.
   Meanwhile, the pilots union leadership is trying to rally its
troops with plans Saturday to build ``the longest moving picket
line in U.S. history'' in a march beginning in Miami and continuing
up the East Coast.
   ``It really can be viewed as the thread of continuity for all
the activities that are going on,'' Cole said. He added that the
demonstration, including rallies in cities along the way, will
culminate in the Labor Day parade in New York.

<HEAD>Psychiatrist Pleads Innocent To Insider Trading Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York psychiatrist pleaded innocent
Thursday to charges that he used inside information from a patient
to make a profitable stock deal.
   Robert Howard Willis, 55, entered his plea at his arraignment in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan on an indictment that charges him
with 46 counts of securities and mail fraud.
   U.S. Magistrate Naomi R. Buchwald released Willis on his own
recognizance and ordered him to surrender his passport.
   The indictment, filed July 26, alleged that Willis received
non-public information during the course of a patient consultation
about an attempt by Sanford I. Weill, the former chief executive
officer of Shearson, Loeb Rhoades, to become head of BankAmerica
Corp.
   The unidentified woman patient discussed the matter with Willis
because if Weill was successful, it could have caused ``substantial
upheaval'' in the personal life of the patient and her husband, the
indictment stated.
   Using the information, Willis allegedly bought $171,130.50 worth
of BankAmerica stock between Jan. 14, 1986, and Feb. 6, 1986.
   The indictment alleged he sold the stock Feb. 21, 1986, after a
public announcement about Weill's attempt to become a BankAmerica
executive, making a profit of $27,475 for himself and family
members.
   Weill, who now heads Primerica Corp., was unsuccessful in his
bid to head BankAmerica. Neither Weill or BankAmerica was charged
with any wrongdoing.
   Willis, of Tenafly, N.J., has an office in Manhattan.
   He was charged with 23 counts of securities fraud and 23 counts
of mail fraud. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine on each of the 46 counts.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith is
among the first in line for one. Aerobics instructor Abbie Miller
of St. Paul, Minn., has her order in. Former South Dakota Gov. Bill
Janklow says no thanks.
   They're talking about the newest generation of the Chevrolet
Corvette, the ZR-1 with an engine that puts more punch into
America's original two-seat muscle car than ever before.
   Detroit's automotive press has been gushing praise for the car,
calling it GM's high-tech answer to the Porsche and Ferrari without
their higher pricetags.
   But don't expect to see thousands of ZR-1s screaming down the
interstates at top speed with youthful joyriders at the wheel.
Chevrolet marketing experts anticipate buyers will be predominantly
college-educated males in their 40s with household incomes of at
least $100,000.
   With a production schedule of 3,000 for the 1990 model year and
a price between $50,000 and $60,000, the car ZR-1 is aimed at
luring at least some would-be customers of the European luxury
performance cars.
   ``We've clearly got enough interest in this thing to sell out
this year once we set the price and get on with it,'' said
Chevrolet spokesman Ralph Kramer.
   The final price is to be determined late this month, when the
ZR-1 begins rolling off the assembly line in Bowling Green, Ky.
   Its 5.7-liter, 32-valve, V-8 engine with 375 horsepower can
propel the car from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, less time than it
takes a phone to ring three times.
   The car also comes with a special switch that shuts off half the
valves, commonly called a ``valet key'' that temporarily tames the
monster engine and prevents hot-dogging car jockeys from roaring
around the parking lot.
   The ZR-1 doesn't have the most horsepower of any assembly-line
production Corvette _ a 1967 model with 435 horsepower did _ but it
does have the highest top speed of any Corvette at about 180 mph.
It has fuel economy ratings of 16 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on
the highway, good enough to avoid the federal government's
``gas-guzzler'' tax.
   It's the latest in a long line of Corvettes, dating to the
original 300 produced in 1953. Since then, more than 900,000 have
been made and they've created a cult with its own magazines, clubs
and rallies devoted to the car's ground-hugging bullet appearance.
   ``I guess it's the excitement, it's like a dream car,'' said
Mrs. Miller, 49, who owns two other Corvettes and has had her order
in for a ZR-1 since July 24.
   As head of GM, Smith gets first dibs. He's had his order in
since late last year.
   The ZR-1 originally was planned as a 1989 car, but engineering
and marketing decisions pushed the introduction back to this month,
making it a 1990 in the automotive industry's calendar year.
   Despite the car's power, highway patrol officers evidently
aren't too worried about an outbreak of ZR-1 speed-mania.
   ``I think that irresponsible people can't afford that car, and
those people who can afford it aren't likely to risk their
investment by driving dangerously on the highway,'' he said.
``Aside from that, regardless of how fast they are, they aren't
faster than a radio.''
   Janklow, governor of South Dakota from 1978-86, is one Corvette
owner who's had some experience with law enforcement officers on
highways. He owns a 1969 T-top 427 Corvette, a car he's unafraid to
push to its limit.
   ``I was notorious for my speeding,'' said Janklow, who has
received about 100 speeding tickets. ``It's just a great
automobile. It's America's one unique touch of freedom.''
   He talks enthusiastically about his 1969 Corvette, but the ZR-1
evidently packs too much muscle for him _ Janklow said he doesn't
plan to buy one.
   Even Joe Pike, a retired Chevrolet merchandising manager and
former editor of the Corvette News magazine, said he has some
reservations about the newest model's power.
   ``I don't think there's half of 1 percent of the people who buy
that car who are capable of driving it,'' he said. ``I don't think
I could drive it anymore even if you could find a place to drive it.
   ``It's the kind of car that belongs on the Autobahn in
Germany.''

<HEAD>Nintendo Creates Division to Develop Home Information Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nintendo of America Inc. has set up a new
division to develop its Nintendo Entertainment System as a home
computer terminal for services such as news, home banking, and
long-distance video game playing.
   Nintendo also announced Wednesday that Jerry Ruttenbur, a senior
vice president with Home Box Office's video division, has been
hired as vice president of network products to lead the
development. Ruttenbur is to begin his new job in October.
   Minoru Arakawa, president of the Japanese company's U.S.
subsidiary, said Nintendo wants to have an interactive
entertainment and informational network in the marketplace sometime
in 1990.
   The Nintendo network would compete with such services for
personal computers as Prodigy, which is owned by International
Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., and CompuServe,
which is owned by H&amp;R Block Inc.
   ``By year-end, more than 20 million U.S. households will have
the NES, and in 1990, each of these households will have access to
the `NES Network,'' Arakawa said.
   Nintendo's entertainment system, an electronic device that
retails for $80 to $100, has been one of the most popular toys in
this country for the past several years. The system hooks up to a
television set to display such games as ``Super Mario Brothers 2,''
``Zelda II,'' and ``Mike Tyson's Punch-out.''
   Nintendo Co. Ltd., the Japanese parent company, already delivers
an assortment of information over its ``Family Computer'' devices
to 150,000 Japanese households, Nintendo spokesman Richard Lindner
said Thursday.
   Lindner said the U.S. subsidiary has talked with American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. about the technological possibility of
having Nintendo devices form part of an information delivery
network.
   ``Several major and recognizable companies have approached
Nintendo to ask how they can become involved,'' Lindner said. He
declined to give any names, saying no formal agreements have been
signed with AT&amp;T or any other company.
   Arakawa said that while plans for the Nintendo network are still
being developed, the core component of the system, the control
deck, would act as a network terminal.
   ``A modem and proprietary software will provide such services as
stock purchase and trading as well as home banking,'' he said. ``In
addition, Nintendo video game fans will be able to compete
one-on-one with players around the country using the `NES
Network.'''
   The Family Computer system uses the same processor unit as the
U.S. Nintendo gear, with the addition of a keyboard and a device
that combines a computer disk reader with a facsimile machine.
Lindner said that beyond the control deck, the configuration and
equipment for the U.S. system has not yet been determined.
   By the end of the year, Lindner said, Nintendo estimates it will
have its games in 21 percent of U.S. households.

<HEAD>Tart Cherry Crop Below Estimates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAIGE St. JOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Association Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's tart cherry crop is
coming in below estimates because of frost kills and delayed
ripening in Michigan, marketers said Thursday.
   Government forecasters had predicted Michigan would grow 190
million pounds of a total of 261 million pounds of tart cherries to
be produced in the United States this year.
   Instead, the Michigan crop now being harvested looks to be as
low as 160 million pounds, even less than last year's
drought-stunted crop, said Phil Korson of the Cherry Marketing
Institute in Okemos.
   Not all of the drop is from spring crop damage. Korson said 1989
crop estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture likely were
too high.
   Michigan ordinarily produces more than three-fourths of the
nation's tart cherries. The smaller crop should not affect
consumers, who see tart cherries in pie fillings and baked goods,
Korson said.
   ``I don't think we're looking at a shortage. We're looking at
stable prices, really,'' he said.
   Processors are getting about 49 cents a pound for tart cherries,
the same as last year when a drought cut Michigan production to 180
million pounds, Korson said.
   Uneven ripening from a cool spring, immature fruit because of a
fungus that denuded many trees and bruised fruit from high winds
have caused widespread quality problems.
   ``I would say in every producing area, some of the crop couldn't
find a market,'' said John Minnema, president of Cherry Central
Cooperative Inc., in Traverse City. ``It's unusual for that to be
so widespread.''
   A full crop would have pushed national cherry production 24
million pounds ahead of what Korson said the market could handle,
and that would have driven prices down. Cherry growers already
complain it costs more to produce their fruit than they can get for
it.
   Many growers have cut back on pruning, mowing and spraying to
save money. That has further reduced production, said Norman
Veliquette, president of the Great Lakes Packing Co. in Antrim
County. ``Growers have cut agricultural practices to the bone,'' he
said.
   A late frost in the heart of Michigan cherry country this spring
killed enough blossoms that Gov. James Blanchard declared a farm
disaster in four counties so growers there can apply for federal
aid.

   Jack Taylor has a saying: You don't
drive a Corvette, you wear it.
   ``If you've ever sat in one, you kind of have that feeling,''
said Taylor, director of manufacturing engineering at the General
Motors Corp. Corvette plant at Bowling Green. ``It's a statement of
people's success in life.''
   Taylor calls his 1966 blue Corvette ``an adult pacifier.''
   The cars, introduced to America in 1953, pacify such well-known
adults as Mike Love of the Beach Boys; members of the singing group
Alabama, who own four; basketball great Michael Jordan and
entertainer Sammy Davis Jr.
   The car also is the choice of such renowned speedsters as Al
Unser, Mario Andretti and Chuck Yeager. Signed photographs of their
Corvettes hang on walls in the plant's visitors' area and the snack
bar.
   This year, Chevrolet will make 26,411 cars at the only plant
that assembles the Corvette, America's first two-seat sports car.
Of these, 3,000 will be the souped up ZR-1 model.
   Corvette assembly moved to Bowling Green from St. Louis in
August 1979. The first car rolled off the Kentucky line in 1981.
The 1-million-square-foot plant, about the size of 22 football
fields, houses more than a mile of railroad track and 7{ miles of
conveyor track.
   About 1,250 workers and 65 robots produce 14 cars an hour _ a
piddling line speed in a world where many factories crank out a car
a minute.
   ``We want to make our quality the best it can be,'' said Jim
Case, a trim utility auditor. ``A person who owns a Corvette is
proud of his car. He knows everybody looks at it and wants one.''
   The price of Corvette is pushing it farther from reach.
   The standard coupe now sells for about $34,000; the convertible
for $40,000. The ZR-1, which begins production later this month,
will cost $50,000 to $60,000.
   Nonetheless, the Corvette plant tour is popular, even among
people who could never afford to buy the car. Jane Bowlin, a GM
spokeswoman, said about 40,000 people toured the plant last year,
making it one of Kentucky's most crowded tourist attractions.
   The plant also is a shrine among Corvette owners. Some leave
their calling cards.
   Corvette club patches fill a display case outside the visitors'
area. They're from the Thunder Basin Corvettes in Gillette, Wyo.;
the Vette Set from Decatur, Ill., and the Flood City Corvettes from
Johnstown, Pa.
   ``Some people take their vacation to come here,'' Mrs. Bowlin
said, pointing out patches from Hawaii, Switzerland and Sweden.
   Inside the Corvette plant, some things are done a little
differently from others.
   During the painting process, the outside of the car is covered
in plastic wrap and workers apply a flat black paint to hidden and
hard-to-reach parts, including the firewall and the inside of the
hood.
   ``We want to cover all the places only Corvette nuts would
look,'' paint supervisor Bob Breeding said.

<HEAD>Orange County Exec Faces Inside-Trade Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Orange County executive has been charged
with making more than $11,000 for himself, a friend and his
mother-in-law through illegal insider trading.
   The civil suit, filed in federal court here by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, accuses Hadson Corp. executive Dennis W.
Evans of buying 2,000 shares of Ultrasystems of Irvine the day
before the company announced it was merging with Oklahoma-based
Hadson.
   Evans, 37, of Mission Viejo also tipped off a friend and his
mother-in-law, who bought 1,800 shares, according to the suit,
which was filed Monday. Neither of them is charged.
   The value of the three individuals' combined shares rose by
$11,115 after the deal was announced Oct. 30, 1987, the suit says.
   The SEC charges that Evans, controller of Ultrasystems' defense
and space subsidiary, was privy to numerous discussions and
meetings about the Hadson merger.
   Through a secretary, Evans declined to discuss the suit
Thursday. Ultrasystems issued a statement saying Evans denied any
wrongdoing and noted that the company itself was not named in the
complaint.

   Stock prices pushed ahead today in another
session dominated by takeover news and rumors.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 16.88 to 2,702.96

   Soybean futures prices closed moderately higher
while grain futures finished mostly higher Thursday on the Chicago
Board of Trade in subdued trading ahead of an Agriculture
Department crop report.
   Firmer cash markets supported the futures, along with signs of
increased export demand for U.S. corn.
   But analysts said most of the buying reflected position-evening
by traders seeking to reduce their exposure to potential price
swings resulting from the crop report.
   ``People are just kind of waiting to see what we've got,'' Dale
Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said before
the report's release.
   The report, released in Washington at 3 p.m. EDT, after the
market's close, projected a 24 percent increase in the soybean
harvest and a 49 percent larger corn harvest than last year, when
drought cut deeply into the crops.
   The corn and soybean numbers were slightly lower than traders
had expected and could prompt buying of futures contracts on Friday.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.96 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1} cents higher with September at $2.24} a bushel;
oats were 1\ cents to 1} cents higher with September at $1.37} a
bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 9{ cents higher with August at
$6.03{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Corn and Soybeans Rebounding from 1988 Drought, USDA Estimates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn production is rebounding from last year's
drought, the Agriculture Department said Thursday, estimating the
1989 crop at 7.35 billion bushels, an increase of 49 percent over
last fall's stunted harvest of 4.9 billion bushels.
   The estimates were based on USDA's first fields surveys of the
year and reflected conditions as of Aug. 1.
   Overall, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board put
total U.S. crop production at 103 percent of the 1977 average, a
scale used to compare output from year to year.
   The latest figures came a week after Congress, responding to
flooding in the South and drought in the Plains, approved an $897
million disaster relief bill for farmers.
   While corn and soybean production were estimated at about
average for the decade, wheat production across the Grain Belt was
forecast at weaker than usual levels, with fields losing
substantial moisture since early July.
   Corn is the largest and most important crop grown on American
farms and, used as feed, is essential to meat, poultry and dairy
production.
   Agriculture Department economists had projected the corn crop at
7.85 billion bushels in June and revised that to 7.45 billion last
month due in part to late plantings in the eastern Corn Belt and
dry fields in the West.
   In the Midwest, however, rains starting in mid-July replenished
some of the subsoil moisture that had been lost.
   USDA economists estimated the yield per acre of corn in 1989 at
112.8 bushels per acre, up 28.2 bushels from last year but 6.6
bushels below the record high of 119.4 bushels produced in 1987.
   They estimated that 65.2 million acres would be harvested, up 12
percent from 1988 but 1 percent less than the July forecast.
   Soybean production was estimated by USDA's Agricultural
Statistics Board at 1.91 billion bushels, up 24 percent from last
year's harvest of 1.54 billion.
   USDA economists forecast the soybean yield at 32.3 bushels per
acre, the fourth highest of record and 24 percent above a year ago.
   Production of all wheat was estimated at 2.04 billion bushels,
up 13 percent from the 1988 harvest of 1.81 billion bushels. That
was 3 percent below the July estimate from USDA.
   Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels,
down 6 percent from last year. Durum wheat was indicated at 90.7
million bushels, up 102 percent from the 1988 harvest but down 19
percent from the July forecast because of drought problems in the
Dakotas.
   The average yield for all wheat was forecast at 32.6 bushels per
acre, just 1.5 below last year's level, with an estimated area for
harvest of 62.7 million acres.
   Other spring wheat was forecast at 487 million bushels, down 10
percent from the July forecast but more than double the 1988 crop.
   With the Soviet grain crop forecast down and export prospects
good, stocks of wheat next June are projected at 474 million
bushels, almost 120 million below last month and 220 million below
the start of the year.
   Cotton production was estimated at 11.8 million bales, down 23
percent from last year and 20 percent below 1987.
   Consumer prices for food rose at an annualized rate of 7 percent
in the first half of 1989 as cold weather hit vegetable fields in
Florida, California and Mexico. Poultry prices also rose sharply on
increased demand.
   But USDA economists are expecting consumer prices to rise no
more than 1 percent on an annualized basis in the second half.

<HEAD>Ford Exec Sees $2,000 Worth of Electronics in Cars of Late 1990s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the late 1990s, cars will have
$2,000 worth of electronics in them, far more than the $900 or so
now, a Ford Motor Co. executive said Thursday.
   ``Our planning is geared toward this eventuality when electronic
systems control all vehicle functional systems,'' said Frank E.
Macher, general manager of the Ford Electronics Division.
   Today, electronics control such components as fuel consumption,
engine cooling and braking in some cars, and the time needed to
develop these electronic systems is shrinking.
   While much of future vehicles may be controlled by electronics,
consumers may be turning away from a plethora of gadgets, Chrysler
Corp.'s design chief said earlier this week.
   Thomas Gale, a Chrysler vice president, said in an interview at
the company's headquarters in Highland Park, Mich., that the
explosion in electronics has produced cars that are complex to
operate and mind-boggling options.
   Gale said Chrysler's new cars of the mid-1990s probably will be
simpler with fewer options offered.
   Macher spoke at a management seminar sponsored by the University
of Michigan.

   The Dow Jones industrial average came up just
short of setting a record closing high today as the stock market

   With about a half hour to go in the session a wave of buying
pushed the Dow past the record closing high of 2,722.42 it reached
on Aug. 25, 1987. But then prices settled back a bit.
   Most other, broader market indicators have already surpassed
their 1987 peaks, and they added to those gains today.
   But brokers said many investors were waiting for the venerable
Dow to join them in a kind of official certification that stocks
had fully recovered from the '87 crash.
   Intense activity in airline issues and other stocks reported or
rumored to be takeover candidates helped keep the market in high
gear.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co., one of the largest
retailers in the United States, Thursday reported a 24 percent
increase in its second-quarter profit.
   For the quarter ended July 29, the retailer had after-tax
earnings of $78 million, or 55 cents per share, up from $63
million, or 42 cents a share, from the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue for the three months increased to $2.04 billion, as
compared with $2 billion for the same period last year.
   The company said the earnings included figures from its discount
segment, 120 Caldor stores and 73 Venture stores, which it
considers to be discontinued operations because of plans announced
June 27 to sell those units. Those discount stores contributed $7
million in profit in the second quarter.
   Earnings for the first half were $141 million, or $1 per share,
on revenue of $4 billion, up from earnings of $125 million, or 83
cents per share, on revenue of $3.6 billion in the first six months
of 1988.
   At the end of the second quarter, the company operated 3,092
stores, including three new department stores and 37 new Payless
ShoeSource stores. Department store operations include Lord &amp;
Taylor and 13 other regional department store chains located
throughout the country.

   The dollar finished higher in domestic dealings
Thursday after putting in a mixed performance overseas.
   Gold prices were mostly higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery rose 40 cents to close at
$367.30 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
late bid for gold at $366 an ounce, unchanged from Wednesday's late
bid.
   Trading was lackluster overseas and in early U.S. dealings amid
anticipation of Friday's reports on producer prices and retail
sales figures for July.
   But technical factors triggered successive waves of buying that
drove the dollar higher across the board at home.
   Adding to the buying enthusiasm was another runup on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed above
the 2,700 mark, said Scott Horwitz, a vice president at the Bank of
Boston's New York office.
   Volume was moderate. Lou Calvello, a trader at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., noted that there was ``not a lot of depth to the
market. People are waiting for the economic numbers to give them
direction.''
   A rumor swept through the market that the producer price index
would slip by as much as 0.4 percent, contrary to initial estimates
of a rise of as much as 0.2 percent.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.20 yen to a closing 139.05 yen. Later in
London, it was quoted at 139.10 yen. In New York, the dollar rose
to 139.80 yen, from 138.95 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the pound. The pound rose to
$1.6280 from $1.6170 late Wednesday. In New York, the pound fell
against the dollar, to $1.6188 from Wednesday's $1.6225.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates: 1.9055 West German marks, up from 1.8935; 1.6395
Swiss francs, up from 1.6315; 6.4415 French francs, up from 6.4000;
1,372.00 Italian lire, up from 1,361.50, and 1.1711 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1710.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday's
rates: 1.8905 West German marks, down from 1.9000; 1.6325 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6350; 6.3955 French francs, down from 6.4050;
2.1275 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1440; 1,356.75 Italian lire,
down from 1,364.40; 1.1722 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1710.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $365.75 dollars a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Wednesday. In the afternoon, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $366.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $366.35, up from $365.00 late
Wednesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.18 to close at a bid
$367.06.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.16 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $5.15. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $5.163 a troy ounce from
$5.155.

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s top managers said
Thursday they are pleased with higher profits and sales during the
past fiscal year, but concerned about increasing competition in
global markets during the 1990s.
   For the fourth quarter, the Cincinnati-based comsumer products
manufacturer had worldwide sales of $5.4 billion, a 9 percent
increase from the nearly $5 billion of a year earlier. Quarterly
net earnings were $171 million, a 22 percent increase from $140
million a year ago. Earnings per share were 99 cents, up from 82
cents.
   The company reported an 11 percent increase in worldwide sales
and an 18 percent increase in earnings for its fiscal year ended
June 30.
   Global sales totaled $21.4 billion compared with $19.3 billion
the previous year, while net earnings increased to $1.2 billion
from $1.02 billion in 1988. Earnings per common share totaled
$7.12, up from $5.96 the previous year.
   P&amp;G said its fourth-quarter earnings this year were reduced by a
$78 million after-tax provision to cover costs of closing a Chicago
plant and certain departments at other U.S. plants.
   P&amp;G paid dividends of $3 per common share for the fiscal year, a
25-cent increase from last year. In February, the annual rate of
dividend payment was increased to $3.20, marking the 33rd
consecutive year of increased dividend payments.
   The company makes and sells laundry and cleaning products,
personal-care products including pharmaceuticals, food and beverage
items and other products for commercial use.

   The Dow Jones industrial average made a
near-miss run at a record high Thursday as the stock market kept
climbing in turbulent trading.
   With about a half hour to go in the session a wave of buying
pushed Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips past the record closing
high of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   But then it settled back to finish at 2,712.63, up 26.55 from
Wednesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
838 up, 653 down and 511 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 198.66 million
shares, against 209.90 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 231.69 million shares.
   Most broader market indicators have already surpassed their 1987
peaks in the past few weeks.
   Brokers said many investors were waiting for the venerable Dow
to join them, however, in a kind of official certification that
stocks had fully recovered from the '87 crash.
   At the same time, some traders apparently opted late in the
session to use the near-record levels in the Dow as an opportune
occasion to cash in on the market's recent gains.
   Brisk activity in airline issues and other stocks reported or
rumored to be takeover candidates helped keep the pot bubbling.
   UAL, which said it would explore a wide range of options in
light of a takeover bid from investor Marvin Davis, climbed 7\ to
251[. The stock has soared 86| points this week.
   Among other prominent airline issues, AMR dropped back ] to 76{

   Paramount Communications, widely discussed as a possible
acquisition target, moved up } to 62~.
   Elsewhere, Procter &amp; Gamble jumped 5] to 123|, making a
substantial contribution to the Dow Jones industrials' gain. The
company reported higher quarterly earnings.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Eastman Kodak, up 1[
at 51}; Philip Morris, up 2} at 163\; International Business
Machines, up ] at 117{; United Technologies, up ] at 54{, and
DuPont, up ] at 118].
   Computer Associates International, the most active NYSE issue,
tumbled 2] to 17, and Cullinet Software fell 1[ to 8\. The
companies cited adverse effects on their current results stemming
from delays in their proposed merger.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $13.48 billion, or
0.40 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

index closed at 382.24, up 1.09.

<HEAD>CEOs Think Federal Budget Deficit Is Serious</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of the nation's top executives polled
recently say the federal budget deficit is a serious problem and
advocate higher taxes on tobacco and alcohol, according to a report
released Thursday.
   The Conference Board said 87 percent of the 400 chief executives
who participated in its survey characterized the deficit as at
least a serious problem, while nearly half labeled it a very
serious problem.
   About 90 percent of the executives think higher excise taxes on
tobacco and alcohol would be a good source of new revenue.
   More than 80 percent called for substantial cutbacks in farm
supports, foreign aid and national defense. Roughly half called for
small cuts in current spending levels for Social Security, Medicare
and benefits for children, the unemployed and veterans, while a
third opposed any trimming of those areas.
   Some 80 percent of the executives proposed cuts in welfare
spending, with roughly a third recommending large cuts.
   ``While excise taxes get fairly high marks, there are distinctly
mixed feelings about the benefits of a major change in the U.S. tax
system,'' said Preston Townley, chief executive of the Conference
Board.
   According to the survey, 42 percent of the executives favor a
value-added tax while 35 percent oppose it. Among other findings,
70 percent oppose boosting the personal income tax rate, and over
74 percent say thumbs down to higher corporate income taxes.

   Energy futures finished higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange Thursday as the market shook off the lethargy
of recent days and made some of its best gains.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 38 cents to $18.59 a barrel
after rising 9 cents in Wednesday's session. The October contract
gained 32 cents Thursday to close at $18.29.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, September
unleaded gasoline rose 0.85 cent to 51.43 cents a gallon and
heating oil for September delivery advanced 0.78 cent to 50.21
cents a gallon. Refined products for delivery later in the year
showed smaller gains.
   Energy brokers said reports of tighter crude oil supplies and
improved refining margins in Europe helped push prices up.
   A report that British Petroleum Co. PLC might discontinue spot
sales of Alaska North Slope oil also helped buoy prices.
   ``A lot of people on the West Coast swap Alaska North Slope oil
for WTI,'' said Jack Unger, trader with Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures. ``Now that might not be available so they have to grab for
crude to put in their refineries.''

   Assets of the nation's 463 money market mutual
funds rose $1.24 billion to a record total in the latest week, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $338.35 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $4.32 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The revised total of $337.11 billion in the week ended Aug. 2
had been the previous highest total.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 227 general purpose funds rose $676.8 million to $107
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $1.52 billion
to $144.81 billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds fell $954
million to $86.53 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.33 percent from 8.47 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.53 percent from 8.64 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
41 days, down from 42 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.47 percent as of Wednesday from 6.45 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.11 percent from 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.27
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.32 the
previous week. Yields were 8.25 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.32 percent; 8.17 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.23 percent;
and 8.16 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.21 percent.

<HEAD>Japanese Real Estate Holdings Surge Ahead in US</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's buying of U.S. commercial real estate
has surged ahead since 1986 and its $10.02 billion worth of
holdings last year was far larger than any other country's, the
U.S. General Accounting Office says.
   ``Most countries' positions have remained somewhat stable, with
the notable exception of Japan, which in just a few years has grown
from a relatively modest share to almost double that held by the
United Kingdom,'' said Allan I. Mendelowitz, the director of the
office for trade, energy and finance issues.
   Japanese holdings increased 64.3 percent from 1987 to 1988, he
added.
   The office makes audits for Congress. Mendelowitz' statement
came in a letter to Sen. Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota. The
letter, dated July 31, was made available Thursday.
   Britain's commercial real estate holdings in 1988 were given as
$5.32 billion. Britain was followed by Canada with $4.17 billion,
the Netherlands with $3.34 billion and the Netherlands Antilles
with $3.19 billion.
   The letter to Burdick updated a report to him of July 10. That
report listed the Netherlands Antilles, a group of five small
Caribbean Islands, as one of four ``identity havens'' used to
conceal the names of actual owners. The others were Switzerland,
Liechtenstein and Panama.
   The figures represent only a small proportion of total real
estate values in the United States. The National Association of
Realtors, a private group, estimated last November that the value
of all foreign real estate holdings in 1986 was only 1.5 percent of
U.S. commercial holdings, leaving out farmland and land used for
housing.
   Citizens of other countries owned even a smaller proportion of
American farms _ about 1 percent, according to the report.
   It said foreign holdings of farmland amounted to almost 12.5
million acres worth nearly $9.5 billion in 1988. Britons were the
biggest holders with 10.6 million acres, followed by Swiss with 2.8
million acres.
   Using an older set of figures, the Bureau of Economic Analysis
of the Commerce Department valued at $90.9 billion all commercial
property held by non-Americans in 1987.

<HEAD>DC-10s Safe, Says FAA Chief; Task Force Looking At Design Changes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 5th graf pvs, Busey formed, to CORRECT that control failure,
not engine failure, was common element in other crashes. Also moving on
general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top aviation official said
Thursday that DC-10s are safe with no evidence to justify grounding
the plane despite two incidents in a month involving explosive
engine failure.
   Federal Aviation Administrator James B. Busey defended the DC-10
at a news briefing as a government-industry task force began
examining possible design changes in the McDonnell Douglas plane
and other wide-body jetliners to prevent explosive engine failures
from disabling the planes.
   ``It's safe to fly. I would fly in the aircraft today,'' Busey
said of the DC-10 less than a day after a Northwest Airlines DC-10
made a safe emergency landing in Denver with holes blasted in the
housing of its tail-mounted engine.
   ``We know of no hard facts that would lead us to take action to
ground the DC-10,'' the administrator said when asked about its
safety.
   Busey formed the task force last month, citing the July 19 crash
of a United Airlines DC-10 that killed 111 people in Sioux City,
Iowa, and two other incidents in which systems that control the
aircraft were damaged in flight. One involved a Japan Air Lines
Boeing 747 in 1985 and the other an Eastern Airlines Lockheed
L-1011 in 1981.
   Investigators said the United DC-10's rear engine apparently
disintegrated in flight, knocking out critical hydraulic flight
controls that meet in the plane's tail section.
   Busey, who has been FAA administrator for six weeks, said it was
too early to make comparisons between the Sioux City crash and the
Denver landing, which he said showed ``the way the system is
supposed to work.''
   The United plane carried General Electric engines while the
Northwest plane had Pratt and Whitney engines.
   Busey acknowledged that the safety of the DC-10 was a ``key
issue of concern for all of us.'' He said the Federal Aviation
Administration was participating in the Denver investigation being
conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board.
   He said that as facts are gathered the FAA would consider
whether to order inspections on all DC-10s and whether to take
other action.
   Any decision to ground the plane would be made only after
careful deliberation, he said.
   ``To act speculatively or on the basis of incomplete information
in my judgment would be irresponsible,'' Busey said.
   ``I personally like the DC-10. It's a very comfortable and
good-performing aircraft,'' he said.
   More than 450 DC-10s are flown by 50 airlines around the world.
   All DC-10s were grounded for a month in 1979 after an American
Airlines plane lost a wing engine, severing hydraulic lines, as the
plane was taking off from Chicago. Investigators blame the crash,
which killed 258 people, on faulty maintenance.
   The administrator said the task force would compare construction
of the four wide-body planes _ the DC-10, the 747, the L-1011 and
the European-made Airbus _ to determine whether hydraulic systems
can be better protected from engine failures.
   Hydraulic lines control the wing and tail mechanisms that steer
planes.
   He declined to say how long it would take for any changes to be
made, but said he wants the task force to complete its work and
make recommendations as quickly as possible. The group includes FAA
officials, representatives of aircraft and engine manufactuers and
other U.S. and foreign aviation experts.
   On another aviation issues, Busey:
   _Said a device capable of detecting plastic explosives in
luggage is expected to be in operation at New York's John F.
Kennedy International Airport next month, with others to be
installed in London; Frankfurt, West Germany; Miami and San
Francisco within a few months.
   _Announced that ``near midair collision reports'' received from
pilots of all types of planes totaled 280 for the first six months
of 1989, down 25 percent from the same period last year. He said
there were seven collisions from January through June, compared
with 12 a year ago.
   _Said air traffic controller errors and pilot deviations also
are down this year. He credited improved educational, regulatory
and enforcement measures.
   Controller errors, he said, fell 8 percent, from 509 to 469.
Pilot deviations declined 30 percent, from 1,580 to 1,104.
   A ``near midair collision'' is defined by the FAA as a
separation of less than 500 feet between planes when there is a
danger of a collision. An operational error occurs when controllers
fail to keep aircraft set distances apart. A pilot deviation
involves violations of FAA regulations such as failure to follow a
controller's directions or honor established flying procedures.

<HEAD>Crop Report Seen Stemming Slide In Corn, Soybean Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report projecting smaller corn and soybean harvests
than grain traders had expected will likely boost futures prices,
ending a month-long decline in the markets for those commodities,
analysts said Thursday.
   Grain and soybean futures advanced modestly Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade before the Agriculture Department crop
report was released, and much stronger gains were predicted for
Friday.
   On other markets, coffee futures prices fell sharply; energy
futures rose; precious metals were higher; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   In Chicago, wheat settled 2 cents lower to } cent higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.95} a bushel; corn was
\ cent to 2 cents higher with September at $2.25 a bushel; oats
were 1\ cents to 1{ cents higher with September at $1.37{ a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents to 9\ cents higher with August at $6.03\ a
bushel.
   The crop report covered a variety of agricultural commodities,
but futures traders in Chicago were most interested in the corn and
soybean numbers because supplies of those important commodities
were hit especially hard by last year's drought.
   The USDA projected a corn harvest of 7.35 billion bushels, 49
percent greater than last year's 4.92 billion-bushel crop. The
agency projected a soybean harvest of 1.91 billion bushels, 24
percent above last year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels.
   Traders were anticipating projections for a 53 percent increase
in corn production and a 26 percent larger soybean crop.
   The difference between the market's expectations and the USDA
numbers alone would probably be enough to spark a wave of buying
Friday. But analysts predicted a bigger reaction based on
indications that most speculators were positioned to profit from
falling prices.
   ``I think this is going to unnerve these guys and blow them out
of the water,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst in Chicago with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   He predicted opening gains of up to 20 cents a bushel in the
soybean market and 8 cents a bushel in the corn market.
   The USDA projected production of all wheat at 2.04 billion
bushels, up 13 percent from the 1988 harvest of 1.81 billion
bushels.
   Coffee futures sank on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange
amid renewed aggressiveness on the part of producers seeking to
increase their share of the recently deregulated market.
   Esther Eskanasy, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc.,
said Colombia, the world's second-largest producer, had dropped its
offering prices by 2 cents a pound on Thursday.
   Coffee prices already are at 13{-year lows near 80 cents a pound.
   Analyst Kim Badenhop of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc., said
prices were likely to fall further.
   ``We're looking at something like 76 cents or so as possiblity
on the downside and fundamentally I can't argue with that,'' he
said.
   Coffee settled 2.36 cents to 2.75 cents lower with September at
79.97 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices climbed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, partly on technical factors and partly on optimism
generated by the Energy Department's weekly supply report, which
showed lower-than-expected stocks of crude oil and gasoline.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 38 cents
higher with September at $18.59 a barrel; heating oil was .58 cent
to .78 cent higher with September at 50.21 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .75 cent to 1.30 cents higher with September at 51.43
cents a gallon.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 20 cents to 40
cents higher with August at $367.30 a troy ounce; silver was 0.8
cent to 0.9 cent higher with September at $5.193 a troy ounce.
   Live cattle futures finished .17 cent lower to .45 cent higher
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with August at 74.67 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
August at 84.67 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with August at 46.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.42 cent lower to .20 cent higher with August at 24.50 cents a
pound.

   Income from tourism in the first half of 1989 was
down 1 percent from the same period last year, China said Thursday,
although it has virtually halted since troops crushed the
pro-democracy movement in June.
   In the first six months of the year, China earned $970 million
from tourism, said He Guangwei, deputy director of the National
Tourism Administration.
   The number of tourists dropped 14.3 pthe officia the same period
last year, to 12.89 million people, the official Xinhua News Agency
quoted He as saying. He did not explain the reason for the decrease.
   Tourists stopped coming altogether immediately after the June
3-4 crackdown in Beijing in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
student protesters and their supporters were killed.
   The summer months are the height of the tourist season, but only
a few foreigners are visiting China. The United States still is
advising Americans not to make unnecessary trips to China, although
the State Department on Wednesday allowed dependents of U.S.
diplomats to return.
   He predicted that 22 million tourists will visit China in 1989
and the industry will earn $1.3 billion. Others, however, are not
as optimistic.
   ``I don't think this year is going to be a very exciting year as
far as business is concerned,'' said Bernd Riegger, general manager
of the Holiday Inn Lido in Beijing.
   The Lido and other major hotels in Beijing are reporting
occupancy rates of 45 percent to 50 percent, but many of their
guests are businessmen rather than tourists. The Lido is normally
90 percent full at the height of the tourist season, Riegger said.
   Beijing's smaller, older hotels, are faring much worse, with
only a handful of rooms seen lighted at night.
   The Beijing Tourism Administration has ordered hotels to cut
staff salaries by up to 25 percent to compensate for the loss, and
hotel employees said some workers have been laid off.
   Taxi drivers complain they must wait hours for a passenger and
often are unable to meet their daily fare quotas.
   ``We in the tourism industry are the most directly affected'' by
the crackdown, said one driver, who waited five hours for a fare.
   But He predicted ``the industry will soon rise from loss.'' He
said China will send delegations to tour fairs in Chicago, London
and Tokyo this year and tour groups will be given discounts, but he
did not elaborate.
   China has slashed air fares on 71 domestic routes by 20 percent
to attract more passengers, and some branches of the state-run tour
agency have announced discounts of 10 percent to 20 percent on
package tour rates.
   Last month, China invited 400 travel agents from around the
world for a two-day, all-expenses-paid seminar to show how safe and
normal Beijing is.
   Some travel agents said, however, that tourists would stay away
as long as martial law remains in effect in Beijing, where armed
soldiers guard intersections and bridges.

   The broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended July 31, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,129.9 billion from $3,118.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,009.0 billion from $4,001.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $776.0 billion from $775.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 2.7 percent,
which is below the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 4.2 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,093.2 billion, a 2.2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,976.6 billion, up 3.2 percent, while M1
fell 6.0 percent to an average of $773.7 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $654 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$586 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $292.1 billion in the two-week period ended
Aug. 9, up from $289.5 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Abuse Allegations Startle Experts in Japanese Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts in Japanese business practices were
startled Thursday by charges that executives of a huge U.S.
subsidiary of Japan's Shuwa Corp. beat and sexually harassed
employees here.
   ``It would be hard for me to presume that those allegations
could be true,'' said William Ouchi, a professor at UCLA's Anderson
Graduate School of Management and the author of ``Theory Z _ How
American Management Can Meet the Japanese Challenge.''
   The assertions were made by former employees of Shuwa
Investments Corp., which has made headlines by buying the Arco
Towers in Los Angeles, the ABC Building in New York and the former
U.S. News &amp; World Report headquarters in Washington.
   Accountant Hajime Tanioka says in a Superior Court suit filed
last week and amended Wednesday that he was repeatedly assaulted by
Executive Vice President Takeshi Shiratori and President Takaji
Kobayashi of the Los Angeles-based firm. Kobayashi's father founded
the parent company.
   And in a suit filed late last year in Superior Court, former
company secretary Dawn Marie Stover says she was pinched, slapped,
fondled and ogled by Vice President Kiichiro Kobayashi, the cousin
of Takaji Kobayashi.
   Kiichiro Kobayashi denied the allegations and in turn accused
Ms. Stover of beating him and berating him with derogatory and
racist epithets.
   Calls to Shiratori and Takaji Kobayashi were referred to lawyer
Craig B. Jorgensen, who said that although he had yet to see the
Tanioka lawsuit, from what he knew of the claims, ``I think they
are false and we're going to defend it vigorously and I think we'll
win it.''
   Ouchi, whose research has taken him to Mazda and Toyota auto
plants, a Sony TV factory and the offices of many Japanese
corporations in the United States, said: ``It would be
exceptionally unusual for a manager to strike a subordinate.''
   ``There's a great deal of formality in most of the social
relationships (in Japan), whether at work or in the community life
outside of work, and touching another person is a much more
socially aggressive act than it is in the U.S.,'' Ouchi said.
   ``Typically, the Japanese executives here treat their American
subordinates with, if anything, slightly more respect than is
typical in Japan because in a sense they are guests here in our
country and they recognize that and they tend to be extra polite.''
   Dennis Laurie, who interviewed 201 Americans working at 21
Japanese companies while preparing his doctoral dissertation at the
Peter F. Drucker Graduate Management Center at the Claremont
Graduate School, said the allegations, ``if true, are an absolute
anomaly.''
   ``I saw nothing like this,'' Laurie said. ``That's not to say
there weren't cultural differences, but the Japanese maintained
very cordial relationships with their workers here, particularly
with the women.''
   Laurie said Japanese managers here are well aware that their
actions will be scrutinized more closely than those of Americans,
and agreed that many are more cautious than they would be in Japan.
   ``Everything I've seen indicates they'd double their efforts in
a precautionary way.''
   In his lawsuit, Tanioka says Takaji Kobayashi struck him with a
telephone and calculator, punched him in the stomach and threw a
set of keys at him when Kobayashi learned that Tanioka was seeing a
former employee.
   Tanioka alleges that Kobayashi struck him on the head with a
book while the accountant was recovering from an eye injury after
Tanioka refused to work overtime.
   The suit also alleges that Shiratori hit the accountant with a
ruler and rolled up newspapers and magazines. Tanioka, who says he
was forced to resign from the company, also says he repeatedly was
verbally abused and called ``fool'' and ``idiot.''
   Ms. Stover, who quit in 1988, alleges that Kiichiro Kobayashi
made sexual suggestions as well as hitting and touching her and
striking her with rulers and other objects.

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. said Thursday it has
increased its exploration interests in Argentina to more than 19
million acres.
   Texaco said its subsidiary in Argentina, Texaco Petrolera
Argentina S.A., has entered into nine new exploration contracts
with Argentina's state oil company, Yacimientos Petroliferos
Fiscales.
   Texaco, which has done business in Argentina since 1922, said it
expects to complete the contracts by next Monday.
   The nine contracts were awarded to Texaco as part of the
``Houston Plan,'' a program by Argentina's state oil company
started in 1985 to open the country's petroleum industry to private
investment.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The July monthly consumer price rise in
Mexico _ 1.0 percent _ was the lowest so far this year, according
to Thursday news reports.
   Mexico City newspapers reported that the Consumer Price Index,
released by the Banco de Mexico, showed a 16.8 percent inflation
rate for the 12-month period ended in July.
   The central bank report said July's inflation was the lowest of
the year and that the 12-month rate is the lowest since December
1978.
   The rates ``continue a downward trend in annualized inflation
which started in February 1988,'' the report said.
   In February 1988 the government began a wage-price freeze to
tame inflation. In July, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
renewed the pact until March 31, 1990.
   The government took the steps to curb inflation that reached a
record 159.2 percent in 1987. Consumer prices rose by 51.7 percent
in 1988 under the plan.

<HEAD>CEO Who Saved Caterpillar to Retire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George A. Schaefer, who led Caterpillar Inc.
to record sales and profits after absorbing nearly $1 billion in
losses in three years, is retiring next June as chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Schaefer, who describes himself as an ``old bookkeeper,'' told a
group of Caterpillar executives last month he will retire shortly
after he turns 62 on June 13, three years shy of Caterpillar's
mandatory retirement age.
   Caterpillar spokesman Gil Nolde told the Journal Star of Peoria
that Schaefer had always planned to retire at age 62, although he
never revealed his plans publicly. Schaefer was out of town
Thursday and unavailable for comment.
   Schaefer announced his decision early to give the board of
directors plenty of opportunity to consider a replacement, Nolde
said.
   When Schaefer took the helm of Caterpillar in 1985, the company
was in a sea of red ink. It lost $953 million from 1982 to 1984 and
slashed its workforce 40 percent worldwide, from a peak of 88,000
to 53,000. Nine plants were closed.
   Under Schaefer, Caterpillar put together $624 million in profits
the next three years and in 1988 posted the highest sales and
profits in the company's 64-year history. Caterpillar earned $616
million in 1988 on sales of $8.18 billion.
   The company also launched an ambitious $1.2 billion plan to
automate all 36 million square feet of Caterpillar factory space.
   Caterpillar has improved its relations with its unionized
workers. After a devastating seven-month strike by 20,000 United
Auto Workers members in 1982-83, Caterpillar has successfully
negotiated two new labor contracts without a strike.
   The dramatic rebound of the nation's largest manufacturer of
earth-moving equipment led industry analyst John Stark, editor and
publisher of Stark's Off-Highway Ledger, to call Schaefer
``probably the best manager the construction machinery industry has
ever had.''
   Schaefer is a Covington, Ky., native who joined Caterpillar in
1951 upon graduation from St. Louis University as an auditor and
accountant.

   A downturn in the heavy-duty truck market
is triggering layoffs and production slowdowns at four Mack Trucks
Inc. plants in Maryland, South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Canada, a
company spokesman said Thursday.
   The company expects to announce next week how the production
cutbacks will affect Mack employees at plants in Hagerstown,
Winnsboro, S.C., Macungie, Pa., and Oakville, Ontario.
   Company officials do not know how long the layoffs would last or
how many there will be, but market conditions were expected to
remain soft through the end of the year, said James Santanasto,
manager of public relations for Mack Trucks, based in Allentown, Pa.
   James Williams, president of United Auto Workers Local 171 in
Hagerstown, said he did not want to speculate on how many workers
would be furloughed, but said he thought it would be at least 200
workers.

<DATELINE>GALESBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for the Journal Star of Peoria
have asked the Knox County Circuit Court to dismiss a $40 million
lawsuit againt the newspaper brought by Thomson Newspapers.
   Thomson, a Toronto-based company that owns 157 daily newspapers
in North America, filed the lawsuit last month, accusing the
Journal Star of interfering with its contract to buy the Galesburg
Register-Mail and two weekly papers for $14.7 million. The deal
included an additional payment of $1.5 million to selected trustees.
   The Journal Star offered $15 million to buy the Register-Mail
and turn it into an employee-owned paper. It also bid $16 million
to buy the paper outright.
   U.S. District Judge Michael Mihm halted the sale to Thomson on
June 30 after former Register-Mail publisher John Pritchard and the
Journal Star sought an injunction. They contended Register-Mail
trustees had violated their fiduciary responsibilities as trustees
by accepting the Thomson offer.
   Thomson has appealed the injunction to the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Chicago.
   In its request Wednesday, the Journal Star asked the Knox County
Court to dismiss Thompson's lawsuit because of the pending federal
cases.

   Two Swiss franc traders pleaded guilty Thursday
and a third pleaded innocent to charges stemming from an undercover
FBI probe of fraudulent trading at the world's largest commodities
markets.
   William Walsh, 23, and Mark Fuhrman, 39, traders in the Swiss
franc pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, each pleaded guilty
to one count of wire fraud and one count of making pre-arranged
trades in violation of the federal Commodities Exchange Act.
   A third indicted trader, Robert Mosky, 33, pleaded innocent
before U.S. District Judge Ann C. Williams to charges of
racketeering conspiracy, 26 counts of mail and wire fraud and 37
counts of violating the exchange act.
   A federal grand jury indicted 46 people Aug. 2 for trading
activities at the Merc or the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Later Thursday, the Board of Trade announced its members had
voted to more than triple the in-house fine for each rule
violation, from $75,000 to $250,000, spokesman Mark Prout said.
   ``We wanted to demonstrate that (members) are serious about
maintaining the integrity of these markets,'' Prout said. ``It
should act as quite a deterrent.''
   Five of those indicted, including Walsh and Fuhrman, have so far
agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors. Most charges
allege schemes in which traders pocketed profits from trades made
for customers while passing their own losses on to customers.
   Walsh and Fuhrman admitted in plea agreements that their actions
were part of an ongoing pattern of illegal transactions at the
Merc. Both implicated Mosky and agreed to testify against him.
   ``On October 13, 1988, I entered in a pre-arranged trade with
(undercover FBI agent) Randy Jackson...designed to limit my tax
liability and at the same time receive cash back at a later date,''
a downcast Walsh told the judge.
   ``At the time you engaged in this act you knew it was wrong?''
Ms. Williams asked.
   ``Yes,'' Walsh replied.
   FBI agent Randy Jannett, who used the name ``Randy Jackson'' as
an alias during the undercover probe, looked on from the back of
the court as the pleas were entered.
   Walsh said he earned $1,450 in unreported income from two trades
with the agent, one of which was executed for the firm Shearson
Lehman Hutton. The confirmation of the trades through electronic
wire communication resulted in the wire fraud charge.
   On the following day, Walsh said, he sold ``Jackson'' Swiss
franc contracts at a better price than he could have gotten in an
open-market trade and Jackson returned 70 percent of the profit.
   Fuhrman said he made a pre-arranged trade with the undercover
agent on Dec. 15, 1988 and received $1,465 from him in profit. On
another occasion, Fuhrman said, he helped another unidentified
trader earn $5,000 by filling a customer order from the Dean Witter
Reynolds brokerage firm at a higher price than the market would
have dictated.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Fleissner said Fuhrman did the
trader a favor in hopes of getting a good turn later.
   Fuhrman agreed and said he knew what he did was illegal.
   Walsh and Fuhrman face prison terms of up to six years and fines
of up to $350,000, but Fleissner said their cooperation would be
considered. They also could face disciplinary action from the
Internal Revenue Service and the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission.
   Both were released on $4,500 personal recognizance bonds.
   Mosky also was released under those terms but agreed that if he
sells his seat on the exchange, he must keep the proceeds in escrow
pending the outcome of the trial.
   So far, 12 traders from the Japanese yen pit at the Merc have
pleaded innocent and three have pleaded guilty.

   Five hundred industrial plants account for
most of the toxic chemical releases reported to the government, and
a third of the 10.3 billion pounds of hazardous wastes come from
only 24 plants, a conservation group said Thursday.
   The National Wildlife Federation analysis of government toxic
release statistics said that the biggest polluters _ the ``Toxic
500'' _ were scattered in 44 states.
   The dozen largest producers of toxic wastes, each releasing more
than 100 million pounds, buried them on site or nearby or used a
procedure of deep injection into the earth, prompting the
conservation group to raise concerns about possible contamination
to groundwater.
   Industry representatives have defended such procedures as being
safe.
   According to the report, the 500 facilities released or buried
7.5 billion pounds of toxic wastes during 1987, more than 70
percent of the total releases reported to the Environmental
Protection Agency last year under a new disclosure requirement that
covered some 18,000 facilities.
   The raw EPA figures were made public in June but no
plant-by-plant breakdown was given along the lines of the
federation's report, though the information was available in
electronic form in EPA's open computer files.
   Using the government statistics and databank, the Wildlife
Federation tabulated a list of the biggest polluters in a 480-page
report entitled ``The Toxic 500.''
   According to the report, about 3.5 billion pounds of toxic
wastes were produced by only 24 plants, with a dozen facilities
each reporting the disposal _ usually into the ground _ of more
than 100 million pounds of toxics. A total of 118 plants reported
releases of at least 10 million pounds of toxic chemicals and each
the 500 polluters reported releases of at least 2.6 million pounds.
   The releases, which are usually legal, included more than 300
different chemicals and metals, 39 of which are considered
carcinogenic, or cancer-causing.
   The biggest polluter on the list was the ALCOA plant in Point
Comfort, Texas, which reported 465 million pounds of toxic wastes
in 1987, almost all of it aluminum oxide buried at the facility.
Another ALCOA plant in Rockdale, Texas, was No. 3 with 329 million
pounds of buried aluminum oxide.
   The National Steel Corp. plant (Great Lakes Division) in Ecorse,
Mich., had the second largest volume of wastes, also aluminum
oxide. The company report it buried the 423 million pounds of waste
within a few miles of the facility.
   While ground disposal practices have been defended by industry
as safe, authors of the Wildlife Federation report said the debris
poses long-term concerns about groundwater contamination.
   According to the Wildlife Federation, the plant with the most
toxic emissions into the air was Amax Magnesium of Rowley, Utah,
which reported spewing out 68 million tons of toxics, mostly
chlorine, in 1987. The plant was No. 22 in the overall toxic
release ranking.
   Five companies reported releasing at least 30 million pounds of
toxics into the air.
   Three Louisiana plants ranked at the top of the list of
facilities that discharged large amounts of toxics into surface
water.
   Two Agrico Chemical Co. plants _ in Uncle Sam and
Donaldsonville, La. _ were ranked No. 1 and No. 3, in water
pollution, disposing 59 million pounds and 44 million pounds of
chemicals respectively, mostly phosphoric acid. The Arcadian Corp.
of Geismar, La., ranked second with 54 million pounds of mostly
phosphoric and sulfuric acid.
   Jerry Poje, one of the authors of the study, said the analysis
also showed a surprising volume of toxic wastes being discharged
into public treatment systems along with other sewage.
   According to the study, the facilities in the St. Louis area
reported the largest volume of toxics released into public sewer
systems.
   Columbian Chemical Co., of St. Louis reported releasing nearly
49 million pounds of toxics, mostly ammonia sulfate, into public
treatement systems. In nearby St. Clair County in Illinois, the
Monsanto Co. reported putting 33.8 million pounds of toxics into a
public waste treatement system from its Sauget chemical plant.
   The study said 100 facilities dumped 550 million pounds of toxic
chemicals into sewer systems nationwide.
   Kennecott Utah Copper, the mining company owned by British
Petroleum, accounts for the largest amount of toxic metal waste,
most of it copper but also arsenic, chrome, barium and zinc
compounds. Most of the 158 million pounds of wastes are buried on
Kennecott property.
   Eastman Kodak Co. in Rochester, N.Y., reported the discharge
more than 9 million pounds of chemicals believed to cause cancer.
Pfizer Pigments Inc., of East St. Louis, Ill., was right behind
with 8.2 million pounds. A breakdown of the biggest polluters of
cancer-causing substances had been made public previously.
   Aluminum oxide was by far the most widely produced toxic waste
among the biggest polluters. The industry has petitioned the EPA to
take aluminum oxide off its toxic substance list, claiming it poses
no chronic health risks. But opponents of such a move argue it is
harmful to the respiratory system and possibly linked to brain
damage.
   No decision has been made by the EPA.

<HEAD>Company Agrees to Buy Days Inn, Newspaper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York hotel company has agreed to buy
Atlanta-based Days Inn if a financing deal for the budget motel
chain can be arranged, a newspaper reported.
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in its Thursday
editions that the agreement calls for Tollman-Hundley Hotels, one
of Days Inns' largest franchisees, to buy Days Inn from Reliance
Group Holdings in a deal worth $765 million.
   Reliance, a New York-based investment firm, bought Days Inn from
the Cecil B. Day family for $615 million in 1984 but never intended
to be a long-term owner of the chain.
   Under the agreement, the newspaper reported, the hotels'
management would be retained and the headquarters would remain in
Atlanta.
   ``We just want to see them do more of the same,'' said Monty D.
Hundley of Tollman-Hundley. ``The people running the company are
doing a heck of a job, and we'd like to see them continue.''
   Days Inn bills itself as the third-largest hotel chain in the
world, with 858 hotels in operation and 472 under development.
   Days Inn President Michael A. Leven said he hopes the company
will become the second-largest hotel chain by 1993, doubling in
size to surpass Holiday Inn.
   Leven said Wednesday he believes Tollman-Hundley will be
supportive of expansion efforts.
   ``They are hotel people very committed to the Days Inn system,''
he said.
   Tollman-Hundley company owns 129 hotels, including 48 Days Inns.

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are investigating
whether Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the former owner of Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan manipulated the thrift for their own benefit,
according to a published report.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. are examining the relationship between American
Continental Corp. and Drexel as part of an investigation of
Lincoln's collapse, The Orange County Register reported in
Thursday's editions.
   The federal agencies now jointly manage Irvine, Calif.-based
Lincoln, which was seized by federal regulators on April 14.
   The bank board has blamed Phoenix-based American Continental's
business practices for Lincoln's insolvency, which may cost U.S.
taxpayers more than $2 billion to protect insured depositors.
   American Continental entered bankruptcy April 13. That move is
is likely to cost more than $200 million to 23,000 Californians who
own uninsured corporate notes sold by Lincoln branches.
   The Register, based in Santa Ana, said it had obtained a
memorandum indicating that regulators are examining:
   _New York-based Drexel's purchase of more than 10 percent of
American Continental stock without telling savings and loan
regulators.
   _American Continental's employee stock ownership plan, which
bought the stake back from the investment firm for $12 million.
ESOP purchases of stock from various insiders have been criticized
by the bank board and holders of the uninsured notes as a way for
insiders to dump the stock at artificially high prices.
   _Drexel letters supporting the value of stock in another company
that Lincoln held. Those shares were then passed from Lincoln to
its parent company, which made a $9 million profit, according to
the memorandum.
   No individual Drexel employees were cited in the memorandum and
it is unclear how many Drexel traders were involved in transactions
with American Continental, the Register said.
   American Continental defended the arrangement. ``There was
absolutely nothing wrong,'' said American Continental attorney Mel
McDonald.
   Drexel spokesman Steve Anreder declined to comment on the firm's
ties to American Continental.
   Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to felonies and pay a $650
million fine to settle unrelated financial fraud charges with the
government.
