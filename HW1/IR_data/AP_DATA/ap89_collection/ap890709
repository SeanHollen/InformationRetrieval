   Fires tore through brush and trees across the West on Sunday,
with one threatening an old cavalry fort where Sioux Chief Crazy
Horse was killed, but lower temperatures and higher humidity were
helping firefighters.
   Fires burned out of control in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado,
Nebraska, Utah, California, Oregon and Wyoming. A fire in Montana
was contained. Light rain and lower temperatures all but
extinguished three large wildfires in interior Alaska, including one
that charred 24,000 acres.
   The federal Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho said about
31,000 fires had been reported through Sunday, and about 1.5 million
acres have burned this year, according to information officer Milt
Williams. By the same time last year, 55,000 fires had been reported
and 765,000 acres blackened.
   The center was coordinating the efforts of 10,000 firefighters,
he said. It also had 50 air tankers in use, up from 42 on Saturday.
   ``We're having some storm activity bringing some relief in the
Southwest, but when it moves east, it's creating more fires due to
lightning in eastern Utah and Colorado,'' Williams said.
   The biggest fire in the West was the Diamond Creek fire, at
12,500 acres, in eastern Utah, but it was 80 percent contained by
Sunday morning, said Mary Plumb, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of
Land Management's Moab District. Efforts were focused on keeping it
out of a 50,000-acre state roadless area, similar to a federal
wilderness zone, she said.
   ``It's real wild, rugged country, real heavy timber,'' Plumb
said. ``We dont want it to get in there.''
   Several other fires in the state were nearing containment by fire
lines, officials said.
   A lightning-sparked fire burned along a 20-mile front in
northwestern Nebraska, threatening the community of Crawford and
forcing the evacuation of more than 629 people from a hospital,
nursing home and Fort Robinson State Park.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr issued an emergency declaration, making
state money available, and ordered National Guard troops to help
fight the fire.
   The blaze was within a half-mile of the old Fort Robinson, where
Crazy Horse was killed by guards in 1877, and fire burned to within
1{ miles of Crawford, a city of 1,300, authorities said.
   The 6-mile-wide blaze scorched 50,000 to 100,000 acres, said
deputy state fire marshal Jerry Larson.
   ``We could see whole lines of trees exploding,'' said Marc
Anthony, a state game and parks commissioner who flew over the fire.
A mushroom cloud of smoke was visible about 90 miles away.
   The fire burned 10,000 to 12,000 acres of trees, scrub and
grassland in the 22,000-acre park's rugged canyons, estimated Park
Superintendent Vince Rotherham. It also charred part of a wildlife
refuge and private land.
   Temperatures around 90 degrees and variable wind complicated
firefighting efforts, officials said.
   But higher humidity and less wind Sunday helped firefighters get
the upper hand on the 10,025-acre Divide Fire in the Gila National
Forest in southwestern New Mexico. U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim
Ness said conditions Sunday were favorable to containing the blaze,
started by lightning June 30.
   Higher humidity, lower temperatures and less wind in Arizona also
helped crews fighting fires that had burned more than 40,000 acres
of forest, range and brush and most were more than 50 percent
contained. Thunderstorms were reported overnight.
   A 1,000-acre fire in the Grand Canyon briefly threatened
President Theodore Roosevelt's hunting cabin, said spokeswoman
Barbara Tracey.
   In northeastern California, a wind-fanned fire had destroyed
3,500 acres of remote brush land and seven buildings by Sunday, and
firefighters constructed a firebreak as wide as an eight-lane
highway across its southern path. A separate 2,800-acre brush blaze
blamed on arson threatened the Ventana wilderness in Big Sur.
   Between 30 and 50 families evacuated Saturday night from two
sparsely populated areas in the 3,500-acre fire's path were allowed
to return to their homes Sunday, officials said. The fire, on the
eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada, had destroyed three homes, a
garage, three barns and numerous sheds and other small structures,
officials said.
   The Butte fire five miles east of Oroville, north of Sacramento,
was brought under control Sunday morning after destroying four homes
and six outbuildings, said D.J. Stephens, a state forestry
department spokeswoman.
   A brush fire burned 2,000 acres in the Laguna Mountains about 40
miles east of San Diego, sweeping through a campground and the
Cuyapaipe Indian Reservation. People were asked to evacuate the
campground, and firefighters protected buildings on the reservation.
   In Colorado, a 100-acre fire destroyed at least five homes and
forced the evacuation of five subdivisions near Sugarloaf Mountain
about 25 miles northwest of Denver, officials said.
   Archaeologists from around the Southwest were called to help
firefighters at Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado
protect ancient Indian relics from a 700-acre blaze. Numerous
lightning-started fires were reported elsewhere around the state.
   Ann's fire in the Bridger-Teton National Forest of western
Wyoming slowed over the weekend, thanks partly to cooler weather,
fire officials say. It was about 60 percent contained Sunday after
having burned at least 3,477 acres in five days, according to forest
spokesman Ed Christian.

<TEXT>
   The new government Sunday
announced economic austerity measures that included a 53 percent
devaluation of the currency and massive utility rate increases in an
all-out effort to halt soaring inflation.
   Earlier Sunday, President Carlos Menem said Argentines must brace
for ``a very tough period'' as the government tries to halt
inflation approaching 1 million percent a year.
   ``We have to conduct major surgery without anesthesia,'' Menem
said as he arrived at Government House the morning after he was
sworn in. ``If not, Argentina has no future.''
   In a televised speech, Economy Minister Miguel Roig said that
beginning Monday the austral will sell for 655 per $1. He also
announced that natural gas rates will rise by 650 percent for
industrial users and 200 percent for homeowners.
   Natural gas is the principal source of energy for home heating in
Argentina.
   State-set rates for electricity, public transportation and other
public services will also increase substantially, Roig said in his
20-minute address. But he did not specify amounts or say when they
would take effect.
   Public Works Minister Roberto Dromi said Saturday that gasoline
prices would increase by 500 percent.
   To help Argentines cope with the increases, the government will
roll back the price of bread and other basic foods and set price
guidelines, Roig said. In addition, most workers next week will get
a special one-time payment equivalent to about $13.
   Businesses raised the price of bread and milk by more than 150
percent on Thursday and Friday in anticipation of government price
controls. Roig did not say how long the government price guidelines
on a variety of supermarket items would be in effect.
   Argentines stocked up at supermarkets when they received monthly
salaries at the end of June, and car owners lined up at gas stations
all weekend to top off their tanks.
   Roig said the government utility rates were ``absurdly low,'' and
that new rates would be ``very stiff.''
   Menem, who attended a Mass Sunday morning at the National
Cathedral and presided over a military parade, said Argentina will
have to ``endure a very tough period in order to emerge from this
crisis.''
   The inflation and the worst recession in Argentina's 173-year
history have severely hurt real wages in this South American nation
of 31 million. Low monetary reserves and a $60 billion foreign debt
leave Menem little room for easy solutions.
   The 12-month cost-of-living increase based on June's inflation
rate of 114.5 percent amounts to a staggering 948,597 percent.
   In his inauguration speech Saturday, Menem called for national
unity. He has gone out of his way since he was elected May 14 to
placate the military, smooth relations with the Roman Catholic
Church, and coordinate plans with labor unions, business groups and
rival political parties.
   It remains to be seen, however, how Argentines who have tightened
belts for several months will react to the measures, and whether
Menem will carry them out in the face of public resistance.
   Labor unions staged general strikes against former President Raul
Alfonsin when he tried austerity measures last year. The measures
triggered looting and rioting in several cities.
   The Central Bank is virtually without foreign reserves, except
for an estimated $1 billion in gold, and tax revenue has shrunk.
   Menem will find it hard to borrow from abroad, as Alfonsin did,
because the country is about $4.5 billion behind in interest
payments on the foreign debt.

   An itinerant painter sought for questioning in the
killing of a Kansas woman and the disappearances of three other
women has decided to fight extradition, authorities said Saturday.
   Richard Grissom Jr., 28, was captured Friday by police and FBI
agents at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, after an
anonymous tipster told authorities Grissom would be meeting an
arriving passenger.
   Police in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park said jewelry
and other belongings of at least one of the missing women were
recovered at the airport from a car stolen in Missouri that Grissom
allegedly drove to Texas.
   Overland Park police began seeking Grissom, an avid bodybuilder,
on June 27 in connection with the disappearance of 24-year-old Joan
Butler, who was reported missing June 16.
   Kansas investigators also said Grissom planned a date with Terri
Maness, 25, of Wichita on June 7, the night she was strangled and
stabbed repeatedly in her home.
   Police also want to question him about the disappearances of
roommates Theresa J. Brown and Christine A. Rusch, both 22, of
Lenexa, Kan., Keller said. He was seen June 24 at a party given by
the women, who were reported missing June 26.
   ``We found items linking the two women to him,'' Keller said.
``Credit cards and jewelry identified as belonging to one of the
Lenexa women were found in his car.''
   But authorities said Grissom wasn't providing additional
information about the three missing women.
   ``He talks a lot,'' and has admitted knowing the women, ``but
he's just not giving you anything you can make a case on,'' said
Wichita Police Chief Rick Stone, who was in Dallas on personal
business at the time of Grissom's arrest.
   Keller said Ms. Rusch was last seen using a bank card machine
near Grandview, Mo. ``We have photos of her from the (card) machine
and she appeared injured,'' said Keller. She also made withdrawals
totaling $2,900 to $3,200, he said.
   So far, Keller said, the three suburban Kansas City women have
not been found and only the body of the Wichita, Kan., woman has
been recovered. Grissom has not been charged in the slaying or
disappearances.
   Grissom is being held on Kansas warrants for parole violation and
felony theft. He initially agreed to return to Kansas to face the
charges, but decided Saturday to fight extradition, which can take
60 to 90 days, Keller said.
   Grissom was convicted at age 16 of fatally bludgeoning a
72-year-old Lansing, Kan., woman with a railroad spike.
   Keller said Grissom spoke with investigators Friday about
unsolved murder cases in Missouri, Kansas and Texas but he had not
admitted being involved in any crimes.

   A boy who was impaled by his neck on an iron
spike after he lost his balance and slipped while climbing over a
6-foot-high fence was in serious condition Saturday at a hospital,
officials said.
   The picket went up from under 15-year-old Julio Castillo's neck
and out his mouth, police and fire officials said. Rescue workers
were forced to prop him up with a ladder while they cut a section
from the fence.
   ``The fence had to go with him to the emergency room,'' said Fire
Department Capt. James Rogers, who helped with the rescue.
   Once at the City Hospital Center, Fire Department rescue workers
scrubbed up and worked with the doctors to remove the spike from the
boy's mouth, Rogers said. The spike just missed the boy's jugular
vein.
   The accident occurred about 5:30 p.m. near the boy's apartment
building in the borough of Queens. The boy dangled from the fence
for several minutes before rescue workers arrived. He was conscious
through the ordeal, officials said.

   Two strong earthquakes shook the Tokyo area within a
minute of each other Sunday morning, swaying office buildings and
knocking goods off shelves. Eleven people were reported injured.
   The first, more powerful earthquake at 11:09 a.m. registered 5.5
on the Richter scale, the Meteorological Agency said. The second
quake was slightly weaker, but no Richter reading was immediately
available.
   In Tokyo, office buildings swayed. In the city of Ito, on the Izu
peninsula about 80 miles to the southwest, parked motorcycles were
knocked over, and canned goods fell from some store shelves.
   Some of the injuries, which were all blamed on the larger quake,
occurred when furniture fell on people in their homes, police said.
However, they said no one was reported hospitalized.
   About 4,000 people were without electricity in the town of Usami,
police said.
   The bigger quake was centered in the ocean off the peninsula
about 60 miles southwest of Tokyo, officials said.
   Trains on nearby land were delayed for about a half hour, a Japan
Railways spokesman said.
   The National Police Agency said it was still investigating damage.
   At least 17,760 small quakes, 380 of them strong enough to be
felt by residents, have shaken the Izu peninsula since Tuesday, the
Meteorological Agency said.
   The quakes have caused burst water pipes, gas lines leaks, and
damages to roads and roofs.
   The open-ended Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at
its epicenter. An increase of one unit means a tenfold increase in
ground motion.
   A quake that measures 5 can cause considerable damage, and one
that measures 6 can cause severe damage.

   President Bush set out Sunday on a journey to
Poland and Hungary, saying Europe ``now dreams of being whole and
free'' after four decades of division put promising delicacy in
fostering that movement.
   In a departure ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base, Bush said,
``My visit underscores the growing importance our nation sees in the
changing face of Central Europe.''
   Trying to encourage political and economic freedom in communist
Europe, Bush was flying first to Warsaw for a two-day stop, where he
will meet with government leaders and address the Parliament. In the
wake of recent elections, nearly half of its lawmakers are members
of the once-banned Solidarity union.
   Meeting with reporters, Bush described the diplomatic situation
``as a little delicate.'' He said he wanted to avoid an appearance
of trying to put Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev ``in a box by
throwing strains on the Warsaw Pact.''
   But, he added, ``I'm not going to back off my principles just
because it might offend Mr. Gorbachev. I will give my aspirations
for a Europe whole and free. What we want to do is encourage them.''
   Leaders of both the governments and democratic movements in
Hungary and Poland ``don't want overpromise,'' Bush said. He
declined to discuss an aid package for Poland, but said some
specifics would be offered.
   He also will visit the Baltic Sea city of Gdansk and deliver a
speech outside the Lenin shipyard where the Solidarity labor
movement was born.
   Bush will fly to Budapest on Tuesday, becoming the first American
president to visit Hungary. After two nights in Budapest, Bush will
go on to Paris for a bicentennial celebration of the French
Revolution and the annual economic summit of the seven major
industrialized countries.
   Concluding a 10-day trip, Bush will stop in the Netherlands for
one day, the first president ever to visit there.
   Bush said his journey ``underscores the tremendous changes,
challenges and opportunities ahead of us.''
   He described Poland and Hungary as ``nations on the threshold of
a new era, nations where the spirit of freedom is strong.
   ``In both countries,'' Bush said, ``we're witnessing remarkable
changes, welcome developments no one would have though possible even
a year ago.
   ``New voices are shaping the course of national affairs and both
countries are on the path towards economic rebirth and political
pluralism,'' Bush said.
   He said that ``Europe is at a turning point.
   ``A continent cruelly divided for more than four decades now
dreams of being whole and free,'' Bush said.
   ``Our task is clear: to see that we mend old divisions, that we
fulfill the decades-old dream and that the new Europe emerges _
secure, prosperous, peaceful and free,'' the president said.
   Bush said that Europe was in the midst of change, ``a time of
unprecedented opportunity for peace, prosperity and freedom.''
   At the summit in Paris, Bush will meet with the leaders of
France, Britain, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada.
   He said that in addition to economic problems, the leaders will
grapple with environmental issues such as global warming,
deforestation and ocean pollution.
   ``We know there are no easy solutions,'' the president said.
``But, provided we work together, I'm confident we can find common
solutions to problems none of us can solve alone.''

<HEAD>Officials Want Cleaner Toilets to Lure Tourists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tourism officials have started a
campaign to clean up the nation's public bathrooms, setting up a
phone hotline for complaints and even peering into toilet bowls.
   The officials are preparing for ``Visit Malaysia Year 1990.''
They are trying to address a common complaint of tourists, who say
the country's public bathrooms are dirty, poorly maintained, and
lacking such amenities as toilet paper and towels.
   Some have also complained about unflushed toilets.
   On Saturday, a 10-member team from the capital's Health
Department, led by agency chief Zainol Arriffin Pawanchee, inspected
bathrooms and kitchens in four hotels in Kuala Lumpur.
   The New Sunday Times said three hotels were cited for failing to
keep their kitchens clean, while another was warned to keep its
bathroom and kitchen tidy.
   The newspaper quoted Zainol as saying many public bathrooms,
especially in shopping complexes, are dirty and missing hand dryers,
towels and toilet paper. In most complexes, a small fee is charged
to use the bathroom.
   To boost the campaign, the Minister of Culture and Tourism,
Sabbaruddin Chik, on June 30 made a surprise check on public
bathrooms in Kuala Lumpur. He took the press in tow.
   A picture in a local paper showed him gazing into a toilet bowl.
   The Ministry has also opened a ``Toilet Operations Room'' for the
public to phone in complaints. On Saturday, it handled 30.
   The New Straits Times put the issue this way in an editorial July
2: ``Anyone who has ever had to hold his breath in a public toilet
will agree that unbelievable as it may seem, there is a pressing
need to educate Malaysians on how to use toilets and how to keep
them clean.''
   A similar toilet campaign also is under way in Singapore.
Beginning July 1, anyone caught failing to flush a public toilet
faced a fine of up to $77. Repeat offenders could be fined as much
as $515.

   Vietnam has slapped a ban on rock videos
and movie videotapes with ``reactionary and depraved'' contents.
   A Vietnam News Agency report, monitored Sunday in the Thai
capital, said it was illegal to import, export or circulate such
material. It did not specify what constituted ``reactionary and
depraved'' contents.
   The announcement, made Friday in Hanoi by Minister of Culture
Tran van Phac, also banned the sale and showing of the videos.
   The agency said hotels catering to foreign tourists could be
granted exemptions but must first submit the videotapes to
government authorities for review.
   Hollywood movies on video and American rock cassettes have
enjoyed growing popularity in Vietnam.
   Even films like ``Rambo: First Blood Part II'' have been widely
circulated. In that movie, the American hero wipes out Vietnamese
communists by the dozens as he searches for American prisoners of
war in the country.

   The Jewish Film Festival gave first prize to the
first Israeli movie on the Palestinian uprising, and its best short
film award went to one directed by a Palestinian refugee, a jury
member said Sunday.
   An international jury awarded the $35,000 first prize to Isaac
Zepel Yeshuron's ``Green Fields,'' produced by David Tur, said jury
member and film critic Yehuda Stav.
   The movie portrays three generations of an Israeli family caught
in the violence of the 19-month-old uprising. Yeshuron, a leading
Israeli director, condemns his characters who accept violence as the
only means of dealing with the revolt.
   ``The Shelter,'' by Palestinian director Rashid Mashrawi, which
describes a day in the life of two Palestinian laborers in Tel Aviv,
was awarded the $10,000 prize for best short film. Mashrawi is from
the Shati refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The 10-day festival that ended Saturday featured more than 130
films from 40 countries, but competition is only among movies made
in Israel.

   Two explosions rocked a town in northern
Jammu-Kashmir state Sunday, two days after clashes between Buddhists
and Moslems injured at least 25 people, news reports said.
   No one was killed or injured in the pre-dawn blasts in Leh,
according to United News of India and Press Trust of India news
agencies.
   ``The explosions occurred at deserted places during the night,''
PTI quoted Leh police chief G.J. Pandit as saying. Leh, a city of
100,000 people, is about 450 miles north of New Delhi.
   Authorities on Friday imposed an indefinite curfew on the city
after clashes between Buddhists and Moslems. Authorities said the
brawls were sparked by an argument between two youths.
   Several shops were set on fire and taxi drivers were dragged from
their vehicles and beaten, the news agencies said.
   The army was deployed to help restore order after police using
tear gas and batons failed to stop the fighting, the agencies said.
   About 90 million Indians, or 11 percent of the country's 880
million people, are Moslem. Jammu-Kashmir is the only state where
Moslems are in a majority. But in Leh, more than 90 percent of the
people are Buddhist. Only about 6 percent are Moslem.

<TEXT>
   Two strong earthquakes hit southwest of Tokyo within
a minute of each other Sunday, triggering landslides and injuring at
least 18 people, police said. They were among thousands of tremors
that have rocked the area in 10 days.
   The first quake, registering 5.5 on the Richter scale, occurred
at 11:09 a.m., the Central Meteorological Agency said. The second
was slightly weaker, but its precise magnitude was not immediately
known.
   The first quake was centered in the Pacific Ocean near Atami on
the Izu peninsula, about 60 miles southwest of Tokyo, officials said.
   It was the strongest among at least 19,363 tremors _ 433 of them
strong enough to be felt by residents _ that have shaken the Izu
peninsula since June 30, the agency said.
   Landslides occurred at 16 places and roads were cracked in 10
places in Ito on the Izu peninsula, said a police official of
Shizuoka Prefecture, or state.
   Some of the injuries, all blamed on the larger quake, occurred
when furniture fell on people in their homes, police said. Two
people were burned from spattering oil in a kitchen, said the police
official on condition of anonymity.
   The official said 2,600 households lost electricity for four
hours. Masayoshi Abe, a railway official, said the region's
high-speed commuter trains were stopped for up to 61 minutes,
delaying about 20,000 people.
   The agency gave no reason for the increased seismic activity.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated
areas, while one measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Beef in Her Past, She's the Secretary for Meat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jo Ann Smith is a beef person. She grew up on
it and remains a great fan of the standing rib roast. She was the
first woman ever to head the National Cattlemen's Association. She
is a fifth-generation cattle raiser.
   Now she regulates the industry she once promoted. But she rejects
the idea that as assistant secretary of agriculture for marketing
and inspection services, she might someday have to choose between
her loyalties to beef and her responsibilities to government.
   Meat has been Topic A all her life. Her husband, Cedric, also
comes from a cattleman's heritage. Both she and her husband come
from families that have raised cattle for generations. She is no
stranger to blue jeans and hard work.
   While she had to separate herself from the operation to accept
the $80,700 presidential appointment earlier this year, her husband
and son still run a 500-head, 4,500-acre ranch near Wacahoota, Fla.
   She was an equal partner. ``I always knew what Cedric was paying
for corn,'' she once told an interviewer.
   She was a conservative Democrat _ she underscores the
``conservative'' _ until 1988, when she campaigned for President
Bush. She ran twice for the Florida Legislature as a Democrat, but
lost both races.
   Then Mrs. Smith, 50, became involved in beef politics as head of
the Cattlemen's Association, one of the most powerful agricultural
lobbies. She helped drag a reluctant industry toward feeding and
breeding changes that produced leaner meat, but it was a struggle.
   ``We were very slow to respond,'' she says. ``You could see the
train coming.''
   ``I really do enjoy beef,'' she says and usually eats it once a
day.
   ``I am not a great lover of fish-fish,'' she says. She has come
to accept it but won't cook it: ``too messy.'' She'll eat it when
Cedric cooks it, which, she says, he does well.
   Her new job puts her in the midst of a dozen arguments, including
controversies over meat inspections _ the Reagan administration
wanted the industry to do more, and the government less _ and over
America's consumption of red meat.
   The health side of government says Americans eat too much of it.
The National Academy of Sciences, in a study that came out last
March, concluded in the most comprehensive evaluation ever of the
effects of diet on health that this country consumes too much fat
and gets too much of it from meat.
   The study advised ``eating lean meat in smaller and fewer
portions.''
   ``No, I don't think we consume too much,'' Mrs. Smith said in an
interview. She said the beef industry already has addressed the fat
issue by putting leaner beef on the market.
   ``We're producing a product that does not have the fat (it once
did),'' she said. ``We recognized that it was the fat that was the
culprit, not the product. And we have addressed that in genetics and
breeding. You can buy lean meat.''
   At the same time, Mrs. Smith endorsed labeling the fat content of
meat _ a position that could raise hackles among cattlemen.
   ``Labeling has certain strong advantages,'' she said. ``The
consumer wants to know. The only way they're going to know is to be
able to read something that (says) this is what the product has in
it.''
   It is a sensitive issue. Anne Winslow, director of nutrition
policy for Mrs. Smith's old organization, the 35,000-member
Cattlemen's Association, said it will be discussed at the group's
meeting in Columbus, Ohio, this month.
   ``Proud producers might view the issue as a positive opportunity
to highlight the nutritional density of the product, beef,'' said
Ms. Winslow, adding that her own recommendation will be for labels
that show how much fat remains after cooking _ after fat has been
trimmed and drained away. She said the stress on fat has turned
attention away from the high iron, zinc and vitamin B-12 contents of
beef.
   Mrs. Smith's pro-label stand and her support for federal
inspection of seafood _ an issue on which the Agriculture Department
has yet to take a stand _ wins applause from the ever-vigilant
consumer movement.
   ``For an industry person, she's more of an activist than you'd
expect,'' says Ellen Haas of Public Voice for Food and Health
Policy. ``She has an understanding about what can be done. She has
been out front on fish inspection.''
   But on some other food issues in her domain, Mrs. Smith tends
toward caution.
   She is waiting for more study to be conducted before taking a
stand on whether meat producers who give their cattle no hormones or
other growth-enhancing drugs should be able to label their product
``organic'' or ``natural.''
   Some cattlemen who have been using a ``natural'' label and who
have found a market among health-conscious consumers say the
government has been trying to get them to drop the label.
   Mrs. Smith said her discomfort with the label is that ``we have
never defined `natural.' Remember that every animal in order to be
bred has hormone in it. The problem that has arisen is, does the
consumer understand this. You want to know that your label is
truthful.''
   On veal issues, Mrs. Smith dodged questions, saying she wasn't
familiar with them. The Center for Science in the Public Interest
and other consumer groups contend that the way some veal calves are
raised _ kept in dark pens so small the calf can't turn around and
fed only a liquid diet to keep the meat light-colored _ are inhumane.
   High residues of antibiotics have been found in veal, the
center's Dan Howell told a congressional subcommittee on June 6.
Mrs. Smith said she knows nothing about raising veal calves and will
have to do her homework on that.

<HEAD>Andreotti Receives Mandate to Form Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president on Sunday gave Foreign Minister Giulio
Andreotti a mandate to create the nation's 49th postwar government,
and it appeared the five-time premier would easily form a coalition.
   Italy has been without a government since May 19, when Premier
Ciriaco De Mita resigned following criticism of his leadership by
the No. 2 party in the governing coalition, the Socialists.
   After President Francesco Cossiga summoned him Sunday morning to
receive the mandate, Andreotti said he would begin trying to form a
government. However, he said his task might be delayed by
preparations for this week's meeting of the seven major
industrialized nations in Paris.
   Andreotti, like De Mita, belongs to the Christian Democrats, who
have dominated Italian politics since World War II. The De Mita
coalition apparently fell because of jockeying by the Socialists,
led by popular former Premier Bettino Craxi.
   Craxi said he would not oppose Andreotti, newspapers reported.
Craxi and Andreotti have worked closely in several governments.
   De Mita's policies would likely continue in an Andreotti
government. The editor of the Rome daily La Repubblica, Eugenio
Scalfari, noted in a front-page editorial that Andreotti and the
leader of the Christian Democrats, Arnaldo Forlani, now hold the
same positions as they did 17 years ago.
   ``We are therefore about to turn back the clock of politics,'' he
said.
   Andreotti said he would work to revive the coalition of Christian
Democrats, Socialists, Republicans, Liberals and Social Democrats
that has governed in recent years.
   He said he was particularly concerned that Italy be ready for
1992, when European Community members are to eliminate all trade
barriers among themselves.
   Andreotti is considered to come from the ``conservative'' wing of
the Christian Democrats, while De Mita is a ``liberal.'' However,
the labels can be misleading.
   For example, while Andreotti is considered close to the Roman
Catholic Church, the premier-designate also has very good relations
with the Communists, Italy's second-largest party, which has been in
the opposition for more than 40 years.
   Andreotti, 70, has been prominent in Italian government since
World War II, serving as premier twice in 1972-73 and three times
successively in 1976-79.

   A turtle who had the misfortune to be run
over was at least lucky enough to be the victim of a veterinarian,
who got a dentist to mend its broken shell.
   The vet, Dr. Joanna McCoy, said she injured the painted turtle
with her car recently near the animal hospital where she works.
   Examining the turtle, she found its undershell broken into two
pieces, but didn't know how to fix it.
   A dentist who by chance was at the hospital for a rare
consultation on root canal work on a dog overheard Ms. McCoy
discussing her problem.
   He stepped in and came to the rescue.
   ``That was just what he needed ... some dental acrylic,'' said
Dr. Anthony J. Calabro. He splinted the shell and glued it back
together with a baby-blue substance normally used for making
dentures and repairing teeth.
   The turtle was up and about in no time and sent on its way.
   ``Getting hit by a car, going to the vet, going to the dentist _
that's a pretty scary day,'' Calabro said.

   If eating two gallons of ice cream in one
day is your idea of fun, you may have a treat in store.
   Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream wants 20 adults and three children to
help determine which flavors will fill freezers next year. Those who
write the best entries will be flown to company headquarters in
Oakland for the Sept. 15 event.
   Tasters are trained to rate flavor, texture and color. Then,
spoon in hand, they visit 25 tasting stations, sampling as much as
necessary to rate each new flavor on a 1-to-10 scale.
   ``Then we turn them loose to do some real eating,'' said Stacy
Gammill, a Dreyer's publicist. ``It's incredible what these people
put away.''
   The company's official taster, John Harrison, says he doesn't
feel threatened by the non-professionals, even though in the past
couple of years they have picked several flavors ``that were big
hits the minute they were introduced.''
   Last year's bunch, chosen from among 15,000 applicants, consumed
an average of two gallons of ice cream a day, he said.
   Along with a plane flight and hotel stay, winners will receive
their weight in ice cream. But, said Harrison, ``we haven't decided
whether to weigh them before or after.''

   It was a big job for such a small place,
but the 5,251 residents here pulled it off _ they're geared up and
ready for the nearly 1,500 pitchers expected for the 1989 World
Horseshoe Tournament.
   Organizers had to raise $40,000 toward cash prizes and trophies.
Volunteer supporters held raffles, dances and even a chili cookoff
to raise money.
   The Black Hills city spent about $30,000 adding 16 horseshoe
pits, lighting and other improvements at the campground where the
tournament will be held, said Finance Officer Beth Benning. The city
already had 20 pits, but tournament regulations call for 36.

<HEAD>Polish Sailors Who Jumped Ship Making Good in America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after he defected to America by jumping
off a Polish ship, 42-year-old Wieslaw Albinski is doing just fine
in America, thanks. He's even got a new job at a computer company.
   ``In my wildest dreams I never anticipated having this kind of
job,'' said Albinski, whose English is coming along but who spoke
with the help of an interpreter. ``I had heard that there were
opportunities here but I had no idea how much.''
   Albinski was one of 48 sailors who fled from three different
Polish vessels in Boston Harbor over several days in January. All
said they were members of the then-banned Solidarity union.
   Albinski and the 47 others have applied for but not yet received
asylum in a political climate that is changing almost daily.
President George Bush left Sunday for a trip to Hungary and Poland.
It will include a two-day stop in Warsaw where he was to address a
newly elected Parliament, nearly half of whose members belong to
Solidarity _ an outlaw just six short months ago.
   Poland and Hungary are ``nations on the threshold of a new era,
nations where the spirit of freedom is strong,'' Bush said Sunday
before leaving from Andrews Air Force Base.
   But Albinski says he likes it here.
   ``There is absolutely no question that I would defect again,'' he
said during an interview last week at the Polish-American Club, as
he sat smoking Marlboros, wearing blue jeans, Reeboks and a T-shirt.
   He said he loves his new job testing computer modules at Teradyne
Inc. in Boston. But like the other sailors, he worries about his
immigration status, and whether his wife and two children in Poland
will be permitted to join him.
   The 48 have almost all been interviewed by officials with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, but have yet to hear whether
they'll be granted asylum, said Cathryn MacInnes, the city adviser
on immigrant rights who handled the Poles' applications.
   Many of them have found jobs in the fishing industry in New
Bedford and Maine, while others are working at hotels and factories
in Greater Boston, said Jack Kowalski, the mayor's liaison to the
Polish-American community.
   Kowalski said the new arrivals got help from the community and a
local church and had no trouble finding jobs.
   ``They went off to work right away. They refused any type of
government assistance,'' Kowalski said.
   At least five of the Polish sailors are working as machinists at
Varian Associates, a vacuum products company in Lexington, making up
to $9 an hour, production manager Gerry Grenon said.
   ``They have a terrific work ethic, the old-fashioned work
ethic,'' said Grenon. ``The one problem is the language problem but
we've provided them some English-as-a-second-language training and
they're coming along.''
   Albinski was a radio operator aboard the Kantar, which pulled
into Boston Harbor just a few days after Polish sailors had jumped
another ship. Nervous about the potential for more betrayals, the
Kantar's captain was ordered not to dock but to pump fuel aboard
from another ship.
   Albinski and the others defected by jumping aboard the refueling
ship.
   As the sailors prepared to leave, the captain stood in front of
them and warned them of the ramifications, Albinski explained
through Kowalski.
   ``As I looked beyond him and saw the skyline of the city (I was)
thinking about what my future would be,'' he said.
   He jumped.
   Albinski said his American co-workers are sympathetic and
helpful, but cannot conceive of how difficult life is in Poland.
Most surprising, he said, is the absence of paranoia in the
workplace.
   ``I come and go as I please ...,'' he said. ``I can speak freely
to my co-workers. I can speak freely to you.''
   And in America, Albinski can let another secret off his chest: He
took the shipboard job only for the money.
   ``I'm not a seaman,'' he said. ``And I'm really not partial to
the sea.''
   But the merchant seamen's fate depends on whether U.S. officials
believe they are freedom-seekers or mainly just interested in better
economic opportunity.
   Timothy Whelan, deputy director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Boston, said at the time of the defections
that officials would consider Poland's political climate, as well as
the lengths the sailors had to go to to leave their homeland.

<HEAD>Residents Return After Acid Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POPLAR BLUFF, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 residents returned to their
homes early Sunday after being evacuated for several hours when a
nitric acid leak sent a vapor cloud over a wide area.
   The leak in a containment tank at a construction site in southern
Poplar Bluff was discovered by a security guard at 8:45 p.m.
Saturday. The evacuations were ordered when authorities feared wind
might carry fumes from the acid to residents' homes.
   The leak was caused by a loose fitting in the 4,000-gallon tank
at the site, where a factory is under construction, said Hercell
Williams, Civil Defense director.
   Workers put lime on the acid to neutralize it, and the
evacuations were called off about 6 a.m. Sunday, Williams said.
   The tank had been filled Friday, and workers were transferring
1,500 gallons from the outside tank to another tank inside the plant
when the leak occurred, a plant spokesman said.
   The guard who discovered the leak, Sam Cole, 34, was in stable
condition Sunday at Doctor's Regional Medical Center. No other
injuries were reported.
   In an interview at the hospital, Cole said he was finishing his
second round of the nearly completed factory when ``I noticed a
steam coming out of the ground outside. It looked like something
bubbling out of the concrete.''
   Cole said the vapors smelled like battery acid.
   ``I got a pretty good hit, backed off and just fell down,'' Cole
said. ``It burned my throat and I started coughing. I was OK until I
lit a cigarette. That made me dizzy and got the dry heaves.''
   Ron Sheeley, an environmental emergency specialist with the
Missouri Department of Natural Resources, said that nitric acid is
extremely corrosive.
   ``It's corrosive to the skin, and the fumes are noxious and can
cause tissue damage,'' Sheeley said. ``It can react to other
substances that burn.
   Most residents in the area left willingly and planned to stay
with friends and relatives.
   But at the C &amp; W Corral Lounge, owner Brenda Brown said, ``When
we learned of the spill we called the police and they said for us to
evacuate the bar.
   ``All of the customers left quickly except for two who wanted to
be locked inside the bar. They finished their beers before leaving.''
   Poplar Bluff, a city of about 20,000, is 160 miles south of St.
Louis.

<HEAD>Nations Look Ahead to Peace in Cambodia Despite Major Barriers</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in almost
11 years, Southeast Asian countries and major Western allies are
seriously thinking about a world with Cambodia at peace.
   Though major barriers remain, last week's meeting of 12 foreign
ministers here underlined that virtually all the major outside
players are determined to bring about peace. They showed their
commitment to finding a settlement despite differences among warring
factions in Cambodia.
   They pinned high hopes on talks among the Cambodians starting
July 24 in Paris and on an international peace conference starting
in Paris on July 30.
   In Brunei, Foreign Minister Wong Kan Seng of Singapore said the
Cambodian conflict, which has preoccupied the region, was winding
down.
   ``We have already begun to look beyond Cambodia'' to economic
issues, he said after the conference ended Saturday.
   To examine new directions, Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila of
Thailand proposed a summit of the group, the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, for next year.
   ``The important thing is that there has been a strong show of
consensus of ASEAN and its dialogue partners on the need for a
comprehensive settlement'' in Cambodia, said a senior U.S. State
Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The dialogue partners, or allies, included the United States,
Japan, and the 12-nation European Community.
   Nations at the Brunei conference said the pullout of Vietnam's
troops from Cambodia must be internationally supervised, the
Cambodian factions must share power in a provisional government
leading to elections, and an international body must also guarantee
the peace. Vietnam has pledged to withdraw all 60,000 to 70,000
troops by Sept. 30.
   Regional leaders are trying to avoid what they call ``an
Afghanistan-type settlement.''
   The Soviet Army pulled its last soldiers from that country in
February, but the Soviet-armed government is still fighting the
U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   Vying for power in Cambodia are the Vietnam-installed government
of Prime Minister Hun Sen and the guerrilla coalition led by Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, which includes the communist Khmer Rouge.
   The danger of prolonged civil war after a Vietnamese withdrawal
is very real. Hun Sen refuses to allow the Khmer Rouge in even a
provisional government. The Khmer Rouge, with up to 40,000 fighters,
reportedly has stocked arms for a major assault after Vietnamese
troops leave.
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when it
ruled Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnam's 1978 invasion ousted it
from power.
   On Wednesday, Sihanouk again refused Hun Sen's calls to make a
separate peace without the Khmer Rouge.
   Hun Sen's side ``is very uncompromising, so there is no reason
for us to be compromising,'' the prince said at his home in Beijing.
   Still, outsiders feel guarded optimism because of the momentum of
diplomatic initiatives over the past two years. Many of these were
undertaken by Vietnamese reformers intent on rebuilding their own
country's economy and ending its international isolation.
   China, which arms the rebels, has also grown more conciliatory on
the issue in recent years, especially in toning down its backing for
the Khmer Rouge.
   The Soviet Union, which is Vietnam's major ally, has told
Washington it supports a major U.N. role in Cambodia, even though
Vietnam opposes it, according to Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.

<TEXT>
   The Exxon Valdez, responsible for polluting
hundreds of miles of Alaskan shoreline, will have an
environmentalist at the controls Tuesday when it enters San Diego
Bay for repairs.
   Capt. Edward J. Silva Jr., the chief San Diego harbor pilot who
will steer the damaged tanker to a National Steel and Shipbuilding
Co. dock, is a member of the sometimes militant environmental group
Greenpeace.
   Silva is a critic of many oil company maritime policies, but on
Tuesday, his primary focus will be to bring the crippled Valdez
safely into port. The ship that caused the nation's worst oil spill
was towed from Alaska by tugs, but for greater maneuverability Silva
will bring it through the bay under its own power.
   Exxon officials said they have no problems with Silva's
membership in Greenpeace.
   ``He's entitled to his opinion,'' said Carrie Chassin, a
spokeswoman for Exxon Shipping Co. ``There are people in Exxon who
belong to the Sierra Club. I'm sure he'll drive that ship in as
professionally as he knows how.''
   Silva, a seaman for 42 years, said he comes from a family of
mariners _ his grandfather and father also were sailors _ and his
concern for the oceanic environment developed naturally.
   He believes the risk of oil spills has increased with crew
reductions in recent years on the more sophisticated tankers.
   ``You can build the strongest ship in the world but if you don't
do the job right and you have an accident, you're going to have an
oil spill, period,'' Silva said. ``Where you're going to stop it is
by making sure the people operating these ships are operating them
safely and have enough people to do the job.''
   The former captain of the Valdez has been accused of drinking on
the job.
   Silva also said he believes the Valdez accident would never have
occurred if a qualified pilot had been aboard to guide the ship
through the sound. The pilot who had helped guide the ship through
Prince William Sound had left it a few miles before the accident
occurred March 24, as regulations allowed.
   ``I may be biased, but there should have been an Alaskan pilot on
board,'' Silva said. ``They're more familiar with the area. I
guarantee you if there had been one on, it wouldn't have happened.''
   Silva said the Coast Guard will take him out to the Valdez by
helicopter Monday so he can familiarize himself with the ship and
its handling.
   ``Given that the ship is damaged, I'm not really sure how it's
going to handle,'' he said. ``Suppose there is a jagged piece of
steel down there someplace I don't know about? It could have an
effect on how the ship steers.''
   ``I'm doing it just to be absolutely certain in my own mind ...
that the ship can handle OK,'' he said.
   ``There's no one more interested in trying to keep this area
clean than I am, believe me.''

   Police trying to cram thousands of soccer fans into
a section of Lenin Stadium in 1982 created a ``human mincer'' that
killed as many as 340 people, a newspaper said in disclosing details
of the world's worst soccer disaster.
   Sovietsky Sport, the official newspaper of the government's
Sports Committee, accused authorities of covering up the disaster
and said it was disclosing the tragedy now ``so as not to forget
people who loved sports until the grave.''
   The Oct. 20, 1982 incident had been reported before, but a death
toll and other details were never released in the Soviet Union.
   A front-page investigative story in Sovietsky Sport on Saturday
said parents believed there were as many as 340 deaths at Lenin
Stadium in Moscow's Luzhniki section. The newspaper repeated that
figure Sunday in another article about the incident.
   ``According to our information _ and no other information has
been provided to the public _ a human mincer at Luzhniki on that day
pulverized 340 lives. In the twinkling of an eye, interior troops
and police cordoned off the stadium, and also quickly surrounded the
tragedy,'' the newspaper said.
   The account said that because only 10,000 tickets had been sold
to the match between Moscow Spartak and Haarlem of the Netherlands
in the 100,000-seat stadium, management decided to cram all the fans
into one section.
   Police ringed the section, and all but one staircase was locked
``to save trouble to the police, cleaners,'' the newspaper reported.
   Police pushed fans toward the exit a few minutes before the end
of the game to prevent a jam at the nearby subway station, it said.
But when the final _ and only _ goal was scored, some fans tried to
return and collided with outgoing fans on stairs that had become
covered with ice in the 14-degree weather.
   ``It was something terrible,'' Volodya Andreyev, who survived the
accident, told the newspaper. ``We couldn't move from where we were
standing, and the crowd was pushing from above and below. It was no
longer possible to control the people who had gone crazy.''
   Sovietsky Sport said the parents of fans who failed to return
home after the match received no information from police and had to
search hospital morgues themselves. The bodies were not released for
burial for 13 days, the newspaper reported.
   Five days after the disaster, The Associated Press quoted
semi-official Soviet sources as saying more than 20 people died and
dozens were injured in a collision of fans on a ramp. A Soviet
newspaper reported casualties at the time, but did not specify
whether people were killed or injured and did not give a number.
   Sovietsky Sport reported on April 18 _ three days after 95 soccer
fans were killed in a crush at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield,
England _ that dozens of people were trampled to death in the 1982
Moscow incident.
   The biggest loss of life previously reported at a soccer match
was on May 24, 1964, when rioting left nearly 300 dead in Lima,
Peru, in a game between Argentina and Peru.
   The worst single-incident sports disaster in modern history
occurred when an estimated 604 people were killed after stands at
the Hong Kong Jockey Club racecourse collapsed and caught fire in
February 1918.
   Sovietsky Sports said a minor stadium official was blamed for the
1982 tragedy and sentenced to 18 months of ``corrective work,'' but
mostly the victims were blamed for alleged unruly behavior.
   Ever since the disaster, no soccer matches have been held in
Lenin Stadium at the end of October because authorities are afraid
survivors will place flowers on the field as a sign of protest.
   Readers suggested a committee be set up to investigate the
tragedy and that a meeting be held at the site Oct. 20 to
commemorate the tragedy, the newspaper said Sunday.
   The account was the latest disclosure by a Soviet media that has
seized upon President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness, to report long hushed-up Soviet disasters.

   Police used tear gas and rubber
bullets to disperse 150 people who erected barricades and smashed
windows in a protest over housing shortages in Zurich, authorities
said Sunday.
   The protest Saturday night caused $100,000 in damage, injured
three officers and led to the arrests of 19 people, police said.
   A police statement said officers used tear gas and rubber bullets
around midnight after demonstrators began smashing the shop windows
in downtown Zurich and erecting barricades of garbage cans in the
streets.
   The Swiss Journalists Union charged that police attacked
journalists to prevent them from covering the violence. The union
demanded an investigation.
   Associated Press photographer Klaus Rosza said he was covering
the disturbances when police chased him into a restaurant. ``They
threw tables to the ground and three of them beat me,'' he said.
Rosza, who was treated for head and arm injuries, said a fourth
policeman sprayed tear gas in his face.
   A police spokesman denied that authorities attacked the
journalist.
   Demonstrations demanding a solution to Zurich's acute housing
shortage, especially of reasonably priced apartments, led to riots
in March that police described as the most serious disturbances
since the start of the decade.

   Authorities are using a zeppelin for surveillance
when about 30 foreign leaders visit Paris for the 200th anniversary
of the French Revolution.
   The 200-foot-long dirigible, estimated to cost $7 million, relays
live television coverage from its two cameras simultaneously to
several command centers on the ground.
   The aircraft went into service last week for the visit of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and was displayed Sunday for
reporters at Le Bourget airport north of Paris.
   It will be used for the celebrations of Bastille Day on July 14,
the simultaneous summit of the world's seven richest countries, and
the July 23 arrival of the Tour de France bicycle race in Paris.
   Designed by the British firm Airship Industries, its envelope is
manufactured in France, its 38-foot-long cabin in Britain, and its
engines are made by Porsche of Germany.
   The cabin has room for a 10-man crew. Fourteen such airships have
been built. They were used for security at the Olympic Games in Los
Angeles and Seoul and for the funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito.

   Cadets from the Virginia Military Institute, in gray
tunics and dark blue plumed hats, are giving the French a taste of
American marching music in this week's bicentennial festivities.
   The 45-member VMI band has been in France since July 6 to
represent the United States at several events marking the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution.
   On Saturday, the VMI cadets and other U.S. marching bands and
majorettes wowed a crowd of several thousand at Paris City Hall with
a display of jazzy music, fancy steps and spinning batons.
   French schools and universities have no marching bands, and the
brassy art is considered quintessentially American.
   The account in Sunday's editions of the weekly Paris newspaper Le
Journal du Dimanche noted that following the Montana Centennial Band
in cowboy hats and blue jeans ``were the ringing tones, a bit more
warlike, of the Virginia Military Institute, whose representatives
were sporting caps topped with blue plumes.''
   Also participating in Saturday's display at City Hall were bands
from James B. Dudley High School in Greensboro, N.C.; North Springs
(Ga.) High School and Lawrence Central (Ind.) High School.
   The most exotic touch came from the Touch of Kyle Twirling Club
of Kalamazoo, Mich. The Journal du Dimanche tried to explain ``le
twirling'' for its readers, describing it as ``manipulation of a
baton, involving at once juggling, acrobatics and dance.''
   Saturday's performance was part of a daylong U.S. salute to the
French bicentennial, which climaxes Friday on the 200th anniversary
of the storming of the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789.
   VMI was founded 150 years ago on the model of the Ecole
Polytechnique, the French military engineering academy _ established
during the revolution _ whose graduates still dominate top jobs in
French industry and technology.
   A tour of the Ecole Polytechnique was on the schedule for the
visiting cadets.

   Dan Quayle was back home again in Indiana
on Sunday, and he said he was not about to change a tradition of
personally taking his daughter to summer camp just because he's the
vice president of the United States.
   The vice president arrived at the Columbus airport shortly before
9 a.m., landing away from the terminal and staying away from
reporters. He left in a black limousine seven minutes later,
planning to visit relatives before taking his 10-year-old daughter,
Corrinne, to summer camp in nearby Brown County.
   The visit was described by Secret Service as strictly private.
   At Franklin, he spent about half-hour visiting his grandmother at
a nursing home. As he left, he told a group of reporters waiting
outside: ``It's good to be back home again. Things in Washington are
going well.''
   He added, ``I've always taken my daughter to camp ... I'm not
going to change that just because I'm in Washington.''

   Albert Gore III, the 6-year-old son of U.S.
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., is out of the hospital after an operation to
examine nerve damage from an accident in April.
   ``The senator reports that Albert's spirits are good and the
prognosis is good,'' Marla Romash, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee
Democrat, said Saturday from his office in Washington.
   The boy was seriously injured when he was hit by a car April 3 in
Baltimore after he let go of his father's hand and ran into the
street.
   He entered Ochsner Foundation Hospital here Wednesday for an
operation to examine what doctors called a stretch injury to a
network of nerves in his right shoulder. The injury limits Albert's
ability to move his forearm, said hospital spokesman Reggie Moody.
   Gore's Washington office said surgeons removed scar tissue but
decided that the injured nerve had a better chance of growing back
and restoring movement to the arm than a grafted nerve would have.
The boy left the hospital Saturday with his parents.

   The Rev. Billy Graham said Sunday he often receives
death threats but pays no attention to them.
   ``I have no bodyguards and I don't have anybody protecting me,''
the 70-year-old American evangelist told television interviewer
David Frost at the conclusion of his three-week British crusade.
   ``We get them quite often and I pay absolutely no attention to
them. They're just put aside. I feel like I'm clothed in the armor
of God and I'll go on as long as God wants me to and if he wants me
killed, I'm happy to be killed.''
   British news reports said Graham defied death threats from
fundamentalist Protestants on Saturday night by appearing with
Northern Ireland singer Dana, a Roman Catholic, at London's Wembley
Stadium.
   Graham said he was not aware of those specific threats.
   Political and sectarian violence between Catholics and
Protestants in Northern Ireland has left more then 2,700 people dead
over the last 20 years.
   He also told Frost he received a letter from Nelson Mandela, the
African National Congress Leader jailed in South Africa, saying he
had turned to Christianity.
   ``He invited me to come and see him,'' Graham said. ``He said
that about three or four years ago he had received Christ into his
heart, he was reading and studying the Bible.''
   Graham did not say when he received the letter.
   Graham said 1.25 million people attended his 13 rallies in
Britain, including 85,000 who braved heavy rains Saturday at Wembley
Stadium.

   ``I wished her the best of success. What else can I say?'' Mayor
Pete Sferrazza, said last week when asked how he felt about the

   ``Playboy presented me with the option to do a very positive

   She said she decided to approach Playboy in March after a friend
said she looked like a model. In fact, she said, she had done some

   Playboy will be distributing 30,000 copies in the Reno area, five

   The Sferrazzas' divorce was finalized late last month. It ended
the couple's second marriage to each other; they were divorced once
before, in December 1987.

   The house has been on the market for about a year.
   Reynolds decided to sell the house, which has two guest houses

   A court sentenced a local Communist Party official
to death for selling a fake name-brand liquor, a report said Sunday,
dramatizing the party's determination to root out corruption that
students recently protested.
   Six other officials were expelled from the party in separate
corruption cases as the ruling party tried to clean up an image
badly tarnished by nepotism, bribe-taking and black marketeering.
   The Beijing Daily said a court in the southeastern province of
Guizhou gave Tongren district party secretary Peng Jingxing the
death sentence for selling fake maotai, a fiery sorghum liquor. The
paper said Peng earned ``staggering profits'' of $50,800.
   At least 26 people have been executed since the army cracked down
on pro-democracy protesters, whose demands included an end to
official corruption. Peng was the first party official to be
sentenced to death under a new anti-corruption campaign announced
after the crackdown.
   Other such campaigns in recent years have failed, partly because
offenders usually were disciplined by the party rather than put on
trial.
   The protests that shook China from April until June gave the
party a strong incentive to try again. The student slogan that won
the most sympathy from the public was ``Down with corruption,'' and
the posters that were most copied were those detailing examples of
nepotism among top leaders.
   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, said two party members
were expelled in Fujian province and several others were put under
supervision or criticized for arranging prostitutes for visiting
businessmen.
   In another case, it said four men who had been party members for
more than 40 years were expelled in Heilongjiang province for
profiteering and bribe-taking.
   There were no new reports of arrests connected with the protests.
According to a count by The Associated Press, more than 2,000
arrests have been reported nationwide by the official media, but
Chinese sources said they believed that many had been arrested in
the capital alone.
   The official media blasted Western suggestions that with time,
China will move away from socialism, and it lectured its citizens
that the best way to improve their lives is by raising production.
   In a harsh half-page commentary, the People's Daily accused the
U.S. government-run Voice of America radio of supporting the
protesters.
   ``This is yet another odious demonstration of America's crude
interference in China's internal affairs,'' it said, ``and (of) the
revival of the old dream of the American anti-communist monopoly
capitalist class of promoting a peaceful evolution in China'' toward
capitalism.
   Such venemous criticism of the United States was common during
the 1960s, when revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung repeatedly claimed
that Washington planned an attack, but it has not been seen in the
Chinese media for years.
   Other political phrases from the 1960s also have reappeared. The
People's Daily commentary said the protests showed that class
struggle still exists in China. Other newspapers have urged students
to learn from the workers, peasants and soldiers _ three ``good''
classes.

   A little more than a year ago, government
riot police attacked striking steelworkers led by the banned
independent Solidarity trade union. Last week, the leader of that
strike took a seat in parliament.
   Poland's communist government, struggling with a dire economic
situation, has been pushed into an amazing political about-face that
still has people shaking their heads in disbelief.
   ``It is not that the economic situation is getting worse from
year to year or quarter to quarter,'' wrote journalist Tomasz
Jezioranski, ``but by now we have reached the state where it is
deteriorating almost from week to week.''
   Some might say day to day, as they list what is not available in
the market, how much egg prices increased or how long an assembly
line has been idled for lack of a simple machinery part.
   Whether viewed in terms of the $39 billion national debt to the
West or the lack of a medicine for a sick child, the economic crisis
has fueled a year of tumult in Poland.
   Election victories by Solidarity have given the union a big voice
in determining who will assume Poland's new presidency in the coming
weeks: Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, his ally Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak or some other communist candidate.
   There is also a possibility that Lech Walesa's Solidarity will
accept the prime minister's post with the job of forming the next
government _ a non-communist cabinet functioning in what remains
constitutionally a communist state.
   These decisions are to be taken soon after President Bush's visit
to the country Monday and Tuesday.
   The communist government and the opposition now find themselves
looking together for ways to address a mind-boggling range of
economy-linked fiscal, social and environmental problems.
   Poland's Golden Age was in the 16th century, when it controlled a
vast swath of central Europe from the Baltic to the Black Sea. But
undermined by successive wars and a weak government structure, it
eventually fell victim to autocratic neighbors.
   Russia, Austria and Prussia divided up Poland among themselves
and the Polish state ceased to exist for 123 years from 1795 until
the end of World War I in 1918. Recreated for a brief but warmly
remembered interwar independence, Poland next suffered more than any
other nation in World War II, losing 6 million people, including 3
million Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust.
   Already weighed down by the rubble of massive wartime
devastation, Poland under communist rule has fallen further and
further behind the European standard of its past.
   The workers' state revolted in 1980, with Solidarity emerging as
the first legal independent trade union in the Soviet bloc. But the
burst of freedom, and the surge of creative economic and cultural
energy that accompanied it, did not last.
   Jaruzelski, with the threat of a general strike and the hint of
potential Soviet intervention, declared martial law on Dec. 13,
1981. Solidarity was repressed and its leaders imprisoned.
   The West cut investment in Poland, the nation's spirit sagged,
and the economy stagnated.
   During a second wave of strikes in August 1988, the government
proposed ``round-table'' talks with the Solidarity-led opposition,
realizing it could not hope to solve Poland's problems without the
opposition it had so long sought to crush.
   The communist leadership decided in a story January plenum that
Solidarity could be legalized again, clearing the way for talks that
culminated with a historic April reform accord.
   The agreement provided for unprecedentedly democratic elections,
with independents allowed to vie for 161 of the 460 seats in the
existing parliament, or Sejm, and all 100 seats in a new Senate.
   Solidarity won all but one of the seats.
   Now, once-jailed Solidarity activists are legislators and the
formerly underground press has a sanctioned daily newspaper.
Roadblocks to private economic enterprises are coming down and the
borders are open to foreign ventures. Encouraged by the atmosphere
of reform, the West has renewed contact that the Polish government
hopes will lead to help with restructuring of the debt.
   There is some cautious optimism among the 38 million Poles. But
there is also a painful awareness that even with political freedom,
inflation is now at an unofficial 100 percent or more annually,
meaningful purchases are more likely transacted in U.S. dollars than
the national currency and the national budget deficit is likely to
grow to six times the planned 1 trillion zlotys.

   The Cuban Supreme Court on Sunday turned down
an appeal for mercy from a decorated war hero condemned to die
before a firing squad for drug trafficking, the official news agency
Prensa Latina said.
   The court also upheld the death sentences of three other former
officers and the prison sentences of 10 other defendants accused of
smuggling tons of cocaine and marijuana into the United States.
   The only avenue of appeal left is the Council of State. Prensa
Latina, monitored in Mexico City, said the council had agreed to
hear the appeal because of the severity of the sentences.
   A court-martial Friday condemned former Division Gen. Arnaldo
Ochoa, 57, to death. Also sentenced to die were three men identified
as among Ochoa's closest collaborators _ ex-Col. Antonio de la
Guardia, ex-Maj. Armado Padron and ex-Capt. Jorge Martinez.
   The military tribunal handed out prison sentences ranging from 10
years to 30 years to 10 other defendants in a case that reached into
the highest levels of the Cuban military and government.
   Ochoa is a veteran of the Cuban revolution who went on to receive
his nation's highest medal, Hero of the Republic of Cuba, for his
service as a field commander in Ethiopia in 1978 and in Angola in
1987-1988.
   He headed Cuba's military advisory mission to Nicaragua in
1985-1986.
   In addition to the drug charges, Ochoa was accused of corruption
during his command of troops in Africa and of smuggling ivory,
diamonds and other contraband.
   He and the others were accused of betraying President Fidel
Castro and the moral standards of Cuba's communist revolution. All
were stripped of their rank and decorations and expelled from the
military and the Communist Party.
   Prensa Latina has said the defendants admitted their guilt but
asked for mercy because of their records.
   The Cuban government has said it would make an example of Ochoa
and his cohorts and it has portrayed their illicit activities as an
aberration. It also admitted that the case came to light in part
because of persistent U.S. allegations Cuba had become a way station
for drug traffickers.
   U.S. Customs surveillance aircraft watched a plane drop bales of
cocaine to a speedboat in Cuban waters Friday, the day Ochoa and the
others were sentenced.
   ``Two MiG fighters came onto the scene and protected the Cuban
airspace,'' said Patrick O'Brien, U.S. Customs special
agent-in-charge for South Florida.
   The next day, U.S. agents found the 37-foot speedboat abandoned
in Biscayne Bay south of Miami, O'Brien said. It had nearly 1,600
pounds of cocaine worth about $10 million aboard.
   Ochoa and the others allegedly arranged for Colombia's Medellin
drug cartel to fly cocaine into Cuba for transfer to boats bound for
the United States.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British are coming, this time on C-SPAN,
which believes the sometimes raucous doings of the British House of
Commons may prove entertaining to television viewers in the United
States.
   ``If you're into, what do you call it, shock television, it may
just be your cup of tea,'' says Neville Trotter, a member of
Commons. ``All TV viewers may see is a lot of arguing, disruptive,
noisy behavior and name-calling to their colleagues on the other
side of the aisle.''
   Beginning in November, the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network
plans to begin televising action in the House of Commons, feeding
the parliamentary deliberations _ live on occasion _ to the United
States by satellite.
   While some might say the decision is just another manifestation
of America's long-held fascination with things English, C-SPAN
Chairman Brian Lamb sees it differently.
   ``One of our reasons for even doing this, except for the fact
that what the British do is interesting, is an opportunity for us to
take a look at comparative government,'' Lamb said in an interview
last week.
   But Lamb agreed with Trotter that U.S. cable audiences accustomed
to C-SPAN's no-frills, gavel-to-gavel coverage of congressional
debate, committee hearings, call-in and talk shows and news
conferences may experience some shocks.
   ``I think Americans are going to love it,'' he said. ``They use
humor a lot more than our Congress does in our debating. I think
they'll be surprised how informal some of the remarks are.''
   For example, C-SPAN viewers will likely get to witness British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's trips to the Commons, where, as
leader of the majority Conservative Party, she must submit to 15
minutes of questioning each Tuesday and Thursday by the leader of
the opposition Labor Party.
   The equivalent here would be turning on the TV and finding
President Bush being grilled on government policy by the leading
Democrat in the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley.
   Mrs. Thatcher resisted the move to allow televising of Commons.
Nonetheless, it's members approved the plan overwhelmingly on June
12, even though it took 22 years to debate the matter.
   Some British pundits suggested Mrs. Thatcher was reluctant
because her voice tends to become a bit shrill when she's under the
lash in Commons. She also wears glasses during those appearances,
and observers claimed she feared it would not be good for her image
being seen on the telly with specs.
   But she also could win a sympathy vote among viewers if the
mostly male Labor Party members are openly derisive, according to
the pundits.
   Like Congress, the British lawmakers have decreed that the
cameras shall not pan away from the speaker to show ``occasions of
grave disorder'' or demonstrations in the galleries.
   Even so, the off-camera noises may be considerable. British
lawmakers tend to be much more rowdy than their American
counterparts.
   ``Some of our members are very badly behaved,'' said Trotter,
``and I think that they will continue to be _ perhaps even worse _
as a result of television.''
   As Washington Post writer David Broder observed in a recent
dispatch, ``The members of the opposing parties face each other
across a very narrow aisle, and as the leaders exchange barbs, the
back-benchers often bellow what are politely called `animal noises'
at opposition speakers.''
   In a recent call-in show on C-SPAN, Trotter said he finds the
U.S. Congress much more genteel and orderly.
   ``If you listen to the participants on the floor of your House,
you see civilized, organized men making well-intended,
well-thought-out statements,'' he said. ``If you listen to the
average British debate, you will notice an obvious antagonistic tone
in the members' voices; if one side says one thing, a member of the
other side will automatically jump to his feet to challenge the
other member.''
   C-SPAN covered Queen Elizabeth II's speech at the opening of
British Parliament last year and now provides regular coverage of
Canada's House of Commons. This year it also will cover the opening
of the French Parliament in Paris on Oct. 4-6 and the European
Parliament in Strasbourg, France, Oct. 9-11.
   Lamb expects the foreign coverage to cost between $250,000 and
$500,000 in a year's time _ a pittance in comparison with what the
major U.S. television networks would spend.

<HEAD>Activists Pleased at Mandela-Botha Meeting; Family Skeptical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Anti-apartheid leaders said
Sunday they were encouraged by a meeting between between President
P.W. Botha jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, but a spokesman for
Mandela's wife was skeptical.
   ``At long last a head of state was heeding the calls of those who
are interested in negotiations,'' Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu
told a Cape Town news conference.
   ``In some ways you could say it is the outgoing president meeting
someone who is going to succeed him in Tuynhuys,'' he said,
referring to the official residence where Botha talked with Mandela
for 45 minutes Wednesday.
   Tutu said there was ``more to be gained than to be lost'' in
meeting with Botha, who ``is after all still the state president. He
still does call the shots.''
   Botha is to step down after elections in September.
   Mandela, imprisoned since 1962, is serving a life term for
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-dominated government.
He is regarded as the leader of the outlawed African National
Congress, and many black South Africans want him to be their
president. Other black leaders refuse to negotiate with the
government until he is freed.
   The ANC has not made any comment on the meeting.
   Colin Eglin, former leader of the now-defunct anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party said the meeting appeared in part an
attempt to get white South Africans used to the idea that the ANC
leader will be released from prison soon.
   ``Mandela's public image is being changed from that of the enemy
to someone who visits the president at his home,'' Eglin said in an
interview.
   But at a news conference at Winnie Mandela's home, the Rev. Frank
Chikane, secretary-general of the South African Council of Churches,
said the government ``is taking advantage of the position of Mr.
Mandela, trying to give the impression to the world that they are
negotiating with him when they are the only ones who have access to
him.
   ``If a leader is put in a situation where he is not able to
consult the people he represents, the people are not able to
indicate they have any hope in what has happened,'' he said.
   Chikane said his comments reflected the views of community
leaders who met at Mrs. Mandela's home, but he did not name any of
them.
   Mrs. Mandela let Chikane speak for her, answering only one
question, about whether she thought the meeting meant Mandela would
be freed soon.
   ``We haven't the slightest idea. It is impossible to analyze the
present indications,'' she said.
   Leaders of major anti-apartheid groups ostracized Mrs. Mandela in
February because of what they called a ``reign of terror'' by her
bodyguards in Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg. Since
then she has made few appearances.
   Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is preparing for
negotiations with exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo to end fighting
between black political groups in Natal province, said ``all men of
goodwill will applaud the meeting between these two sons of South
Africa.''
   Zulu youths who oppose Buthelezi and support ANC policies cheered
when the Botha-Mandela meeting was mentioned during a Durban rally
Sunday that drew 6,000 people.
   The rally was called by the Congress of South African Trade
Unions, involved in the peace negotiations with Buthelezi's Inkatha
organization to stop violence that has taken some 2,000 lives in
Natal in the past three years.

<HEAD>Florida's Anti-Abortion Governor Says Compromise Possible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who favors calling a
special session of the state's legislature to enact new restrictions
on abortions, said Sunday he expects ``very aggressive'' lobbying by
both sides but hopes there will be no resort to violent tactics.
   ``I believe there is a compromise that can be reached between the
rights of the unborn and the rights of women,'' said Martinez,
himself an abortion opponent.
   The Republican governor, appearing on ABC's ``This Week With
David Brinkley'' program said areas of possible compromise include
permitting abortions in cases of rape, incest or where the mother's
health is threatened.
   Although he has not yet made a final decision, Martinez said he
prefers calling a special session of the legislature in October.
   Also interviewed on the program was Vermont's Democratic Gov.
Madeleine Kunin, who criticized the Supreme Court's decision last
week upholding a Missouri statute restricting abortions.
   ``What the Supreme Court has really done is created a different
standard in each state,'' she said. ``It's created turmoil where
there was an uneasy truce. And it's wrenched open a very, very raw
wound. The kind of emotional and antagonistic debate that has
erupted is going to be very, very tough.''
   Gov. Kunin called the Missouri law's ban on using taxpayer
dollars to fund abortions ``a dangerous restriction because so many
women are dependent on public funds.''
   `` And when you take away public funds,'' she said, ``you really
take away their choice as to whether and when they want to have a
child.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of sunbathers were trapped on
south Beirut beaches for hours Sunday as rival Shiite Moslem
militiamen battled with machine guns, mortars and rocket-propelled
grenades in nearby neighborhoods, police said.
   Syrian troops in charge of security in Beirut's Moslem sector
arranged a one-hour ``mercy cease-fire'' at sundown and evacuated
the trapped beach goers, said a police spokesman.
   ``It was like a horror movie... Flocks of people ran in every
direction as grenades and gunfire burst in the air,'' said Massara
Kahwaji, a homemaker who joined an evacuation convoy as she returned
to west Beirut from a weekend in south Lebanon.
   Also Sunday, Syrian gunners in north Lebanon fired sporadic
barrages at the Christian enclave's coast to prevent a ship
suspected of carrying arms from docking.
   The Syrian guns opened up again in late afternoon, shelling the
Christian residential districts of Baabda, Yarzi and Hazmiyeh
southeast of Beirut. Police said two people were wounded.
   By police count, 403 people have been killed and 1,576 wounded
since the March outbreak of the Christian-Syrian confrontation.
   Three people were killed and nine were wounded in the militia
violence in south Beirut, said the police official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   That brought the overall toll to 11 killed and 37 wounded in the
current confrontation, which erupted nine days ago between the
pro-Syrian mainstream Amal militia and the Iranian-backed,
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The militias are vying for power over Lebanon's 1 million Shiite
Moslems.
   The fighting blocked all escape routes from south Beirut's Ouzai
and Jnah districts and stranded thousands of people on the sand
throughout the day.
   Syrian armored personnel carriers took many evacuees to coastal
villages south of the capital, while others were escorted back to
west Beirut as sniper fire crackled overhead.
   In Beirut, Syrian and Christian troops traded sniper fire along
Beirut's dividing Green Line, forcing a one-hour closure of the only
open gateway between the Moslem and Christian sectors of the city.
   The hostilities were evidence that Arab League trouble-shooter
Lakhdar Ibrahimi had failed to make headway in his four days of
talks with Christian and Moslem leaders in Beirut.
   Ibrahimi wound up two days of talks with the army leader, Gen.
Michel Aoun, and other Christian leaders in east Beirut on Saturday.
On Sunday, he met with Moslem Parliament members in west Beirut.
   One parliamentarian, requesting anonymity, said Ibrahimi was
trying to arrange a meeting of the Lebanese Parliament outside
Lebanon to draw up political reforms that would give Moslems an
equal share of power with the Christians.
   The Christians have dominated the government, army, Parliament
and judiciary since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943,
when Christians were thought to be the majority.
   According to experts, Moslems are now the majority of Lebanon's 4
million people. They have been fighting in the 14-year-old civil war
for political equality.
   Parliament has been unable to meet in Beirut since September,
when President Amin Gemayel's term expired with no successor elected.
   The source said Ibrahimi contends that once political reforms are
drafted, chances will improve for holding a Parliament session in
Beirut to elect a new president, who would form a national coalition
Cabinet to carry out the reforms.
   Minutes before stepping down, Gemayel named Aoun, a Maronite
Catholic like himself, prime minister of a military caretaker
Cabinet.
   Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment and pledged allegiance to
Syrian-backed, acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who
governed under Gemayel.
   The split splintered the army and police along sectarian lines
and eventually led to the outbreak of the current Christian-Syrian
confrontation.

<HEAD>More Cubans Allowed To Visit United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Castro government is allowing
increasing numbers of older Cubans to visit the United States, and
U.S. officials say the reason is clear _ money. The Cubans charge a
fee of $700 and up for the privilege.
   ``In the last six months the number of Cuban citizens being
allowed to visit relatives in the U.S. has jumped dramatically,''
the Sun-Sentinel quoted an unidentified U.S. official in Havana as
saying.
   The number of B-2 tourist visas, issued by the U.S. interests
Section in Havana, that the Cuban government has allowed to be used
jumped from 230 a month in October to 1,823 a month in March to
about 3,000 a month in June, the newspaper reported Sunday.
   At the present rate, by year's end about 30,000 Cubans will have
entered or be eligible to visit the United States.
   No figures are kept on the number who seek asylum, said Eileen
Convy, assistant Immigration and Naturalization Service district
director in southern Florida.
   The United States approves most visa requests from Cubans,
consular officials said.
   However, the Cuban government restricts the use of the visas to
men over 65 and women over 60, and requires them to pay a fee of
$700 to $1,000. Cuban exiles in the United States mail their
relatives the money for the fee.
   ``All you have to do is multiply 3,000 by $700 try to determine
how much the Cuban government is keeping, and you'll see it's in the
millions of dollars,'' an unidentified consular official told the
newspaper. ``All those dollars are paid by the relatives in the
states.''
   The U.S. Interests Section, which handles U.S. affairs in Havana
because the nations lack full diplomatic relations, said the numbers
will continue to grow if the Cuban government allows it.
   ``The Cuban government is very excited about this stepped-up B-2
program because it represents a lot of money for them, which they
always need. They have even talked of lowering the age of those
eligible to travel, from 60 to 50 years, and that would create more
business,'' the newspaper quoted a U.S. official as saying.
   Told of the increase in tourist visas from Cuba, State Department
spokesman Frances Jones said: ``I guess we are being caught by
surprise by this increase. Our people in Havana have not informed us
yet.''
   Relatives of Francisco Carbonell, 70, who had not seen him for
nearly 30 years, recently brought him to Miami.
   ``He wanted to come and we thought maybe this would be the last
time we would see each other,'' said Eduardo Heria, 65, one of
Carbonell's cousins.
   Six relatives contributed $720 so Carbonell could pay the fee for
a 20-day visit. An additional $225 would have extended his stay to
40 days.
   Each visitor is allowed to return to Cuba with 100 pounds of
luggage. Only clothes and food items are allowed. Jewelry and
electrical appliances, things that can be resold, are not permitted.
   Returning travelers must pay four Cuban dollars for each pound
brought back. They must also declare any U.S. dollars they have;
those dollars may be spent only at a tourist store on the island.
   ``I would normally not want to give money to Castro's
government,'' said Heria, an exile for 25 years. ``But I wanted my
cousin to taste America at least once in his life. So, I gave Castro
a few dollars. It was a dilemma.''

   Jesse Jackson on Sunday visited a Palestinian
hospital and shook hands with youths hospitalized with injuries
suffered in the uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``We hope that as America looks at this situation, we will look
not only at the politics of the re-elections and of positioning, but
just at the moral obligation to relieve our children of being at
risk,'' the civil rights leader said.
   During his visit to the hospital of the Palestine Red Crescent
Society, Jackson was accompanied by Fat'hy Arafat, head of the
society and a brother of Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
Yasser Arafat.
   His tour included a visit of the ``Intefadeh Ward,'' named after
the Arabic word for uprising. He bent down and shook hands with
Osama Abu Mustafa, 12, and Akram Ashour, 18, as they sat in their
wheelchairs and smiled.
   Both from the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, they said they were
shot in the back while throwing stones at Israeli soldiers. They are
paralyzed from the waist down, physician Abdel-Kader Shaaban said.
   The Palestine Red Crescent Society, founded in 1968, maintains
branches in several Arab countries and is funded by donations from
the World Health Organization, the Red Cross Society, Arab
organizations and other sources.
   Jackson was in Cairo since Wednesday to attend a meeting of the
U.S. National Council of Negro Women.

   It took 1,900 tons of dirt and rock and
10 hours of labor into the night, but workers triumphed over a
20-foot sinkhole threatening to devour John and Betty Priest's
house, although they did lose the front lawn. ``It's good being
back,'' Priest said Saturday. ``There's nothing like it.''
   The couple had to be evacuated last week when flood waters caused
Ridley Park Lake to overflow and opened the sinkhole.
   Borough engineer James Kelly, who ordered the evacuation, thought
any more rain might cause the hole to widen and possibly destroy the
home. But then he and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
officials came up with the plan to fill the hole.
   Workers using several trucks Friday, worked almost non-stop
hauling fill materials of dirt and rocks to the Priest home. The
stuff had been excavated at a nearby highway construction site and
was unneeded, officials said.
   Volunteers from nearby fire companies kept roads open for the
trucks and provided lighting that allowed the filling to continue
after dark.
   ``I never saw anyone work like those guys did,'' Priest said.
   ``When I read in the papers about people who were flooded out and
lost everything, we were lucky,'' he said. ``We didn't lose anything
but the front lawn. There wasn't a drop of water in the house.''

<TEXT>
   As C. Everett Koop closes out a seven-year,
high-profile stint as the nation's surgeon general, officials in the
Bush administration are wrangling over whether they want his
successor to enjoy the same visibility.
   Though he possessed very little statutory power, Koop used the
office as a bully pulpit to hammer at the hazards of smoking, raise
the nation's awareness of AIDS and become, as he puts it, the
``health conscience'' of America.
   Although technically his office is within the Department of
Health and Human Services, Koop was an independent surgeon general _
at times a little too independent to suit some conservatives in the
Reagan White House.
   ``I'm not clear that office will ever again hold the stature it
did under Koop,'' said Jean McGuire, director of the AIDS Action
Council.
   It's not clear whether the Bush administration wants it to.
   While the White House is collecting names of possible nominees
for the job, some in the administration want its profile lowered.
   According to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
thought has even been given to simply adding surgeon general to Dr.
James Mason's title as assistant HHS secretary for health, a move
that is not without precedent.
   Chase Untermeyer, personnel director for President Bush, declined
to speak directly to the varied opinions circulating. But, he said,
``We're proceeding on the assumption that it will be separate from
Dr. Mason.''
   About 15 names are on a list of people who have indicated they
are interested in the job or have been recommended by others,
Untermeyer said, refusing to identify any of them.
   ``The names have been coming in on their own since it was made
public (in early May) that Koop would be leaving,'' he said.
   Burton Lee, the president's personal physician, said he is
``pushing for a woman'' to get the job and has recommended the names
of several he believes are qualified. He declined to identify any of
them, but said none is a well-known public figure.
   ``It's turned out to be quite a political job,'' Lee said, and
will probably become even more so with the Supreme Court's ruling
last week giving states more authority to limit access to abortions.
   ``No matter who you get, they're going to be the subject of a lot
of criticism,'' he said.
   One name that has surfaced is Dr. James H. ``Red'' Duke, a noted
trauma surgeon at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston
and host of PBS' ``Bodywatch.''
   Supporters of the 60-year-old ``cowboy'' doctor say he's got the
same kind of charisma and communications skills that worked so
successfully to make Koop an American folk hero.
   A name mentioned by conservative groups is Dr. Robert Redfield,
chief of retroviral research at Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research.
   But Gary Bauer, a former Reagan White House aide who now heads
the Family Research Council, said conservative groups ``are only now
beginning to focus on (the vacancy) and realize it's an important
post.''
   AIDS activists, who heap kudos on Koop for taking the lead on
AIDS and speaking openly about condoms and sex education to prevent
its spread, are also watching to see who his successor will be.
   They are heartened that Lee _ who served on the President
Reagan's AIDS commission _ has Bush's ear as the president's
personal physician.
   ``A strong person with moral persuasions on this issue could be a
real problem,'' the AIDS Action Council's McGuire said. ``Koop
helped break down the moral impediments around AIDS .... My biggest
fear would be someone who would build them up again.''
   As for Koop, the 72-year-old pediatrician will step down this
week and begin writing his memoirs and looking for media
opportunities to continue preaching his health messages.
   In a recent session with reporters, Koop said his activism and
independence strengthened the office of surgeon general and give his
successor ``a better opportunity of accomplishing things.''
   Asked how he would advise his successor, Koop said recently:
``Don't try to copy me or anybody else. ... Do what you can do and
be who you are to the very best of your ability. That's exactly what
I did.''

<HEAD>East Germany Silent on Honecker's Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 24 hours after reporting that Communist
Party chief Erich Honecker was suffering from a gallbladder ailment,
East Germany's state-run media on Sunday remained silent on the
76-year-old leader's condition.
   Honecker was forced to return home early from a Warsaw Pact
summit in Bucharest, Romania, on Saturday. The official news agency
ADN said then he was suffering from an ``acute gallbladder
ailment.'' It did not say if Honecker had been hospitalized and gave
no other details.
   It said, however, that Honecker congratulated Premier Willi Stoph
on his 75th birthday, but that the greeting was conveyed by Egon
Krenz, a senior member of the Communist Party's Politburo and deputy
head of state.
   Krenz, 52, often has been mentioned as the top candidate to
succeed Honecker as party chief.
   Honecker became party leader in 1971 and assumed the additional
post of head of state in 1976.
   During recent public appearances, Honecker seemed to be in robust
health and alert.
   But West German newspapers reported in recent months that he
appeared to lose concentration and showed speech problems during
various meetings with West German officials visiting East Germany.

   A van loaded with 15 people returning from a
family reunion collided with a pickup early Sunday, killing six
people and injuring 10, police said.
   Four of the dead were children, one just 2 weeks old, after the
12:15 a.m. accident on U.S. 84 about 4 miles west of this
southeastern Georgia town.
   U.S. Army Staff Sgt. James Koonce, 29, of Hinesville was driving
the van loaded with relatives following a family reunion in Hahira
when it collided with the truck driving by Scott Steedley, 16, of
Manor, said Jack Crawford, Waycross post commander for the Georgia
State Patrol.
   Crawford said the truck apparently veered off the road and then
back into the path of the van.
   Neither driver was killed. Steedley was listed in extremely
critical condition at Baptist Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla., early
Sunday and Koonce was in fair condition at Ware Memorial Hospital in
Waycross, Crawford said.
   But Koonce's wife, daughter, sister and two nephews were killed,
along with the father of one of the nephews.
   Crawford identified the dead as: wife Shirley Koonce, 28, of
Hinesville; daughter Sheena Marie Koonce, 4, of Hinesville; sister
Valerie Tribble, 10, of Hahira; nephew Lorenzo Barquel Wilson, 1{,
of Riviera Beach, Fla.; 2-week-old nephew Curtaious Johnson of
Riveria Beach; and the infant's father, Cornell Johnson of Riveria
Beach, whose age was not immediately available.
   In addition to the two drivers, Koonce's four sons and another
daughter, two of Mrs. Koonce's sisters and a niece from West Palm
Beach, Fla., were hospitalized. The two women were listed in
critical condition.

   Two Palestinians reportedly were fatally shot by
troops on Sunday, and soldiers blew up the home of a Palestinian
accused of killing 14 people by forcing their bus to crash.
   Police in Jerusalem dispersed a crowd of Israelis who chanted
``Death to Arabs!'' and stoned Arab cars in anger over the bus
attack on Thursday, the deadliest event in the 19-month-old
Palestinian uprising.
   Police on horseback charged the stone-throwing Israelis, mostly
Orthodox Jews in black hats and long coats, when rioting erupted
after the funeral of Moshe Shapiro, 74, one of the bus victims.
   Police said 11 Israelis were arrested Sunday, bringing to 27 the
number arrested since the violence over the bus attack broke out on
Friday.
   Israeli officials criticized the three days of anti-Arab
violence, which left one Palestinian dead and nine wounded.
   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin broke a three-month silence
and condemned the violence.
   ``It is self-evident that this despicable crime carried out
against bus passengers ... caused deep pain in the hearts of every
citizen of Israel,'' the 75-year-old Begin said in a statement
released by his spokesman Yehiel Kadishai.
   ``But the responses we have seen in the last few days will only
sharpen hatred between the two nations and it must be prevented,''
he said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday on Israel's Arab
television news: ``I'm sorry for the attacks. These are
irresponsible acts that do not help anyone, bring chaos to our land,
and do not hurt the Arabs in the end.''
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the Labor Party, said
his center-left party would decide Monday whether to pull out of the
coalition government led by Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.
   Several Labor ministers have called for such a move, saying
principles adopted by Likud last week could discourage Palestinians
from agreeing to Israel's plan for elections in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   A Labor pullout could topple the government seven months after
Israel's elections.
   Israel television reported Sunday that high-ranking U.S.
officials were urging Labor not to leave the government.
   A high-ranking U.S. State Department delegation plans to visit
Israel in 10 days to discuss the future of the government's proposal
for elections in the occupied lands.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens summoned U.S. Ambassador William
Brown on Sunday to complain that the United States failed to condemn
the bus attack as terrorism, a ministry statement said.
   The statement said Arens also told Brown the Palestine Liberation
Organization ``has long ago broken the conditions set by the U.S.
government for continuing the (U.S.-PLO) dialogue'' in Tunisia.
   The U.S. Embassy had no comment on the statement.
   On Sunday, a senior police official said that investigators
believe the bus attacker acted on his own. Palestinian sources said
he apparently was avenging the beating of a brother by soldiers last
month and the arrest of other relatives during the uprising.
   Soldiers blew up the home of the suspect, Abdel Hadi Salman
Rassem Ghanem, in Gaza's Nusseirat refugee camp on Sunday. The
government often destroys or seals homes to punish Palestinians
suspected of violent attacks.
   The United States has condemned the practice as a violation of
due process rights because most suspects have not faced trial when
their homes are destroyed.
   Ghanem, 23, was in the hospital ward of an unidentified prison
Sunday recovering from head and chest injuries suffered when the bus
plunged into a deep ravine. Police say Ghanem grabbed the steering
wheel from the driver and forced it to crash, killing 14 people,
including 10 Israelis and injuring 27.
   In the West Bank village of Ramin, near Nablus, 20-year-old Ayman
Hamad was shot in the chest and killed when soldiers opened fire on
masked Palestinians building a roadblock to stop troops from
entering the village, Arab hospital officials said.
   In Madana, also near Nablus, Fayez Yousef, 21, was killed by a
gunshot wound to the chest when troops opened fire on a group of
youths who stoned an army patrol, Arab reports said.
   A military spokesman said the army had hospital reports of a
death in Ramin but was still investigating the circumstances. He
said he had no reports of the Madana incident.
   The deaths would bring to 552 the number of Palestinians killed
in the uprising. Thirty-three Israelis have been killed.
   Seven other Palestinians were reported shot and wounded Sunday in
clashes with the army.
   Under Shamir's election plan, Palestinians in the West Bank and
Gaza would choose representatives to negotiate with Israel on
limited self-rule.
   Shamir maintains the principles voted by Likud on Wednesday do
not affect the plan, but U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
criticized the party's action as ``not helpful'' to the peace
process.
   Likud said no elections would be held until the uprising ends and
that a program of building Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories will go forward.

<TEXT>
   Sudan's new military leader, Lt. Gen. Omar
Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir, Sunday announced formation of a Cabinet that
will try to end the nation's six-year civil war and revive its
faltering economy.
   The 21-member Cabinet, in which el-Bashir doubles as prime
minister and minister of defense, was announced over state
television by Brig. Mohamed Sulaiman, a member of the ruling junta
who acts as government spokesman.
   The country has a $13 billion foreign debt and spends $1 million
daily fighting southern rebels led by turncoat army Col. John
Garang. They want greater regional autonomy.
   The cabinet is to be sworn in on Monday. But Western diplomatic
sources have said they do not expect the junta, a 15-man military
council headed by el-Bashir, to yield decision-making power to the
Cabinet.
   The junta was formed after el-Bashir ousted Prime Minister Sadek
el-Mahdi in a coup on June 30.
   The Cabinet includes three members of the military council, four
southerners and two former officials who worked under former
President Gaafar Nimeiri but broke with him shortly before his
ouster in 1985.
   El-Bashir's deputy in the military council, Brig. El-Zobair
Mohamed Saleh, was appointed deputy premier. Two other junta members
appointed were Brig. Faisal Abu-Saleh, as police minister, and Lt.
Col. El-Tayeb Ibrahim, as minister of presidential affairs.
   Foreign Minister Aly Sahloul, Finance Minister Sayed Ali Zaki and
Minister for Health and Social Welfare Shaker el-Serag served as
underscretaries in their respective ministries before el-Bashir's
coup.
   The southern Cabinet appointees are Abdallah Deng Niyal, minister
of guidance; Nataly Yelker Ambo, minister of local governments;
Edward Ador, minister of relief; and the Rev. George Kenga, minister
of labor and social insurance.

<HEAD>Former Investigator Sues Author of Book on Chappaquiddick</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former state police detective who investigated
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's 1969 accident at Chappaquiddick is suing
the author of a book on the incident, claiming the author never paid
for his information.
   Bernard J. Flynn, the police detective lieutenant, claims that
author Leo Damore promised him $50,000 for his cooperation when
Damore was writing ``Senatorial Privilege,'' an account of the
accident in which the senator's 28-year-old passenger, Mary Jo
Kopechne, was killed.
   ``This is a contract that is oral in nature,'' Flynn's attorney,
Gary A. Nickerson, told the Boston Sunday Herald. ``However, there
are some written memorandums that reflect the existence of an oral
contract.''
   The fatal Chappaquiddick accident, which also helped to kill
Kennedy's hopes of being president, occurred 20 years ago this
month, on July 19, 1969.
   Flynn told Damore that he met secretly on at least two occasions
with Kennedy's brother-in-law, Stephen Smith, and lawyer, Herbert J.
Miller, to pass along information about the district attorney's
probe into the accident.
   Damore said he paid Flynn $1,000 to cover expenses but said he
never promised the investigator any money.
   ``I told him `you can't be paid for this information,''' Damore
said. ```You'll hurt yourself and you'll hurt the credibility of the
information,' I said to him, `as far as money is concerned, forget
it.' There was no contract here, none.''
   Damore has filed to dismiss the lawsuit, but said that if it goes
to trial he might be forced to subpoena Kennedy, Smith and Miller.
``That alone is worth $50,000,'' said the author.
   The book was published in 1988 by Regnery Gateway, a conservative
publishing house based in Washington, after it had been rejected by
a number of New York publishers. Damore, of Old Saybrook, Conn., is
a former Cape Cod resident who has written several books, including
a flattering account of John F. Kennedy's years on the Cape.
   One of the Chappaquiddick book's most controversial revelations
was an allegation that Kennedy wanted to tell police that Kopechne
had been driving alone on the night of the crash. That account was
based on interviews with Kennedy associate Joseph Gargan, who went
with the senator and another friend, Paul Markham, to try and rescue
Kopechne after the accident.

<HEAD>Moldavians Mass in Huge Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of ethnic Moldavians and opponents from
non-native groups gathered Sunday in a tense demonstration, Soviet
TV reported.
   ``Today in Kishinev, there was a flaming tinder but there was no
explosion due to the balanced steps taken by law enforcement
bodies,'' a correspondent reported from the Moldavian capital in the
western Soviet Union.
   It did not say what steps authorities took to calm the situation.
   Members of groups demanding more rights for ethnic Moldavians
carried tri-color nationalist flags and banners and shouted slogans
such as ``Moldavia to Moldavians'' and ``Get out, Occupiers,'' the
correspondent said on the evening news program ``Vremya.''
   One huge red banner visible amid the thousands of people on
Kishinev's main square read, ``We aren't Guests, we are Home!'' That
appeared to be a slogan of non-ethnic Moldavians who are members of
a largely Russian group, Interfront, and feel threatened by the
nationalists' demands.
   Soviet TV said Kishinev officials had authorized Sunday's rally
but wanted it to be a forum for dialogue between opposing groups.
Instead, the demonstrators heckled a Moldavian representative to the
national parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, according to
the television report.
   Ethnic Moldavians have been agitating for months with strikes and
demonstrations to have their native language restored to its
original form. They also have complained about crime and
environmental problems.
   Moldavia has long retained close ties with Romania, its neighbor
to the west, despite repeated attempts by Moscow to link it more
closely with Russia.
   The region of 4.2 million people has passed from Turkish to
Russian to Romanian and back to Soviet control over the past century.
   Moldavian and Romanian are the same spoken language, but the late
dictator Josef Stalin imposed the Cyrillic alphabet on the
Moldavians after Soviet troops occupied the region during World War
II.
   Moldavian Communist Party chief Semyon Grossu in February
condemned nationalist activists for going too far but endorsed some
of the language demands. Draft legislation that would gradually
reinstate the Latin script still used in neighboring Romania has
been published for public discussion.

   Thunderstorms developed Sunday along the Gulf Coast, from Lake
Michigan to the central Appalachians and over the Rockies, and
temperatures hit record highs along the eastern edge of the Rockies.
   Thunderstorms produced heavy rain early in the morning in lower
Michigan and northwestern Indiana, then moved into the central
Appalachians and upper Ohio Valley during the day.
   South Bend, Ind., got 3.65 inches of rain, enough to cause street
flooding, the National Weather Service said.
   Warm, very humid air from the Gulf of Mexico spread across the
central Gulf Coast states and produced strong thunderstorms. High
wind from a thunderstorm west of Philadelphia, Miss., downed trees
and power lines and damaged several farm buildings, the service said.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered over the northern
Rockies and southwestern Texas. Houston, Texas, got a half-inch of
rain in 20 minutes.
   Hot, hazy weather was common across much of the nation. An
upper-level high-pressure system centered over southwestern Nebraska
caused the hot weather and has prevented the movement of any major
weather systems into the central section of the nation.
   Readings were above 100 degrees over southeastern South Dakota,
southwestern Nebraska and the desert Southwest.
   Denver posted a record high of 98 and Cheyenne, Wyo., had a
record high of 96.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at Monterey and Arcata, Calif., to 102 at Sidney, Neb., and
Needles, Calif. Sunday's low in the Lower 48 states was 38 degrees
at Truckee, Calif.
   For Monday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from upper
Michigan across the upper Ohio Valley into New England. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms were forecast over the Gulf Coast and
central North Carolina, as well as across Utah into Montana.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast,
northwestern Montana and much of Maine; in the 80s from the northern
intermountain region between the Cascade Range and the Rockies
across northern Minnesota and northern sections of the upper Great
Lakes to much of New England; near 100 degrees over the middle
Mississippi Valley; above 100 across the desert Southwest and along
the Big Bend of the Rio Grande in Texas; and in the 90s over much of
the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Tanker That Spilled Oil into Delaware River Leaves for Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARCUS HOOK, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Uruguayan supertanker that spilled more
than 300,000 gallons of oil into the Delaware River last month left
Sunday for repairs in the West Indies.
   The cleanup of the June 24 spill is about 80 percent complete,
``but we'll be at it for several more weeks,'' said Coast Guard
spokesman Jim Weakley.
   The tanker Presidente Rivera left this oil refinery city just
southwest of Philadelphia and steamed down the Delaware Bay,
reaching the Atlantic Ocean shortly after noon, Weakley said.
   The 749-foot-long ship's destination is Curacao, a West Indian
island about 170 nautical miles northwest of Caracas, Venezuela,
Weakley said.
   A Coast Guard tug, patrol boat and helicopter escorted the vessel
12 miles down the river from Marcus Hook to the Delaware Memorial
Bridge to watch for leaks, the spokesman said. No contamination was
spotted.
   Two commercial tugboats and a skimmer vessel used to clean up the
spill also accompanied the tanker to the bridge.
   The helicopter remained over the Presidente Rivera until it
reached the mouth of the bay, and made periodic overflights after,
Weakley said. A Coast Guard representative was aboard the ship until
it reached Lewes, Del., at the mouth.
   The tanker had been scheduled to leave Saturday, but was delayed
because an overboard discharge monitor had to be replaced, Weakley
said. The monitor measures the amount of oil lost when a ship pumps
out water taken on as ballast.
   The ship passed a final inspection by the American Bureau of
Shipping before leaving.
   The tanker's bottom has been temporarily patched and oil has been
cleaned off its hull, Weakley said.
   The tanker ran aground June 24 off Claymont, Del., near the
Delaware-Pennsylvania line, ripping open its bottom and spilling
300,000 gallons of thick, tarry industrial heating oil.
   The cleanup of the Delaware River has recovered about 400,000
gallons of oil and debris, Weakley said.
   The Presidente Rivera is expected to reach Jacksonville, Fla., in
five days, and is scheduled to go into drydock in Curacao on July
26, he said.
   The investigation into the accident is continuing, and it may be
several months before a cause is determined, Weakley said.

<HEAD>Bush to Poles: ``The World is Inspired by What is Happening Here''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, on a delicate and historic
mission to accelerate renaissance in Poland and Hungary, told the
Polish people Sunday the world is inspired by their struggle but
cautioned it ``will require further sacrifices.''
   ``History _ which has so often conspired with geography to deny
the Polish people their freedom _ now offers up a new and brighter
future for Poland,'' Bush said upon his late-night arrival in Warsaw
after a nine-hour flight from Washington.
   He did not elaborate on his prediction of sacrifice ahead for the
Polish people, but administration officials have made clear any U.S.
aid will be tied to economic austerity measures by the Poles
themselves.
   The Poles declined to approve a severe economic austerity program
two years ago that would have raised food prices and put other
pressures on their already lean economic existence.
   Officials said at the time the program would send prices for such
consumer services as rent and heating up as much as 200 percent and
that the price for basic food items such as milk, bread and meat
might double.
   Bush was greeted by Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and
Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski as he came down the ramp of
his airplane.
   Also present was Andrzej Wielowieyski, deputy speaker of Poland's
new freely elected Senate and an adviser to Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa. It was the first time a Solidarity representative has been
included at an official Polish state welcome.
   After inspecting a military honor guard and shaking hands with
dignitaries invited to the airport ceremony, Bush and Jaruzelski
strode to a speaker's platform for their brief remarks.
   Before leaving his own capital, Bush had made clear he is
sensitive to the two Warsaw Pact nations' need to transform
themselves without antagonizing the Soviet Union, which borders both.
   ``It is not our role to dictate to them what they should be doing
or the refinements of the system,'' he said at a departure ceremony.
   In Poland, Bush said ``winds of change surely have touched the
land here where so much has happened since my last visit'' two years
ago as vice president.
   ``Poland has started a long and ascending path of democratic
change,'' he said. ``This climb is accelerating but will not always
be easy and will require further sacrifices. But if followed, it
will lead to a renaissance for this remarkable nation.
   ``These are great days for Poland,'' Bush continued. ``Solidarity
is again legal. The beginnings of a free press now exist. A new
parliament is in place. The Polish senate has been restored through
free and fair elections. Poland is making its own history. And
America, and the world, is watching.
   ``The world is inspired by what is happening here,'' he said.
``Here in the heart of Europe, the American people have a fervent
wish. ... That Europe be whole and free.''
   Tactfully, Bush promoted Jaruzelski, the country's communist
leader, who was at the airport when the U.S. president's plane
touched down.
   ``The government of Poland and you, Mr. Chairman, have shown
vision and courage in taking the path of the round-table accords,''
the president said. He made no mention of Jaruzelski's role in
trying to break Solidarity and in imposing martial law in December
1981.
   The Polish leader greeted Bush as an ``outstanding politician and
statesman, the leader of the great American people with which the
Poles are linked by lively ties of friendship based on long
tradition.''
   Jaruzelski said, ``Warsaw residents who have come in such great
numbers to see you and greet you this summer evening are giving an
expression of this.''
   Despite the late hour, thousands of people scattered in groups
along Bush's 4.5 mile motorcade route cheered and waved as he rode
past. Some of them waved huge American flags as Bush pulled out of
the airport, a large crowd waved and many people shouted
``Solidarity.''
   In his departure statement in Washington, Bush had said Poland
and Hungary were ``on the threshold of a new era'' and that Europe,
``a continent cruelly divided for more than four decades, now dreams
of being whole and free.''
   In a conciliatory gesture toward Moscow that signalled his
determination to end the Cold War era, the president said his task
was ``to see that we mend old divisions, that we fulfill the
decades-old dream, and that the new Europe emerges _ secure,
prosperous, peaceful and free.''
   Bush's 10-day trip also will take him to a summit meeting in
Paris with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and
West Germany and include a side trip to the Netherlands _ the first
official visit by a U.S. president to America's oldest diplomatic
partner.
   But the emphasis will be on Bush's visits to Poland and Hungary,
the two Soviet bloc countries with the most pronounced trend toward
a Western-style economy and a democratic political system.
   The symbolism of it all is immense: No U.S. president has visited
a Warsaw Pact nation since Jimmy Carter went to Warsaw in 1977 and
never has a U.S. president been to Hungary.
   Bush's goal is to wean Poland and Hungary from Moscow's orbit and
toward a more independent foreign policy. But the president is being
careful not to couch his mission in competitive terms _ nor to
exhort Poles and Hungarians into reckless actions that could
backfire.
   In a television interview aired as the Bush party was flying
across the Atlantic, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said
Bush's offer of economic aid to Poland will be a ``measured
response.''
   ``The one thing that might create ... a wedge rather than a
continued movement of reciprocal progress would be to put such a
large package in there that the Poles would perceive that we are
trying to replace the Soviet Union's support with support from the
West,'' he said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   ``That's not our intention,'' Sununu said. ``We are not trying to
replace. What we are trying to do is augment.''
   As for challenging Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
barnstormed in West Germany last month and has just completed a
visit to France, Bush disavowed any intention of being provocative.
   ``I think if we went there with hot rhetoric and our goal was to
complicate things for Mr. Gorbachev, yes, there would be a danger,''
Bush said just before Air Force One took off from Andrews Air Force
Base and headed toward a sun just climbing above the eastern horizon.
   ``But I think I know enough about it ... and others upon who I'm
relying know enough about it ... and know that's not going to
happen,'' he told reporters.
   At the same time, Bush vowed: ``I'm not going to back off my
principles because it might offend Mr. Gorbachev. I'm not going to
try to put him in a box by throwing strains on the Warsaw Pact. I
will give my aspirations for a Europe whole and free. What we want
to do is encourage them.''
   Jaruzelski, in an interview on CNN's ``Newsmaker Sunday''
program, said Bush's visit was taking place ``at a very important
moment'' in history and ``that is why I see President Bush's visit
as an element that would favor the positive processes which are
already taking place and which are bringing East and West closer
together.''
   Recalling the talks that were held when Bush visited Warsaw as
vice president two years ago, Jaruzelski said he recognized then
that ``Poland's matters are very close to him (Bush) and understood
by him.''

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major government arms warehouse
exploded and burst into flames near the city's airport Sunday
destroying a large quantity of ammunition and weaponry, witnesses
said.
   The explosion in eastern Kabul occurred close to midnight Sunday
and shook buildings up to five miles away. It was not immediately
known what caused the blast but the city has been the target of
rocket attacks by Moslem guerrillas in the past week.
   The fire burned for more than two hours throwing glowing shrapnel
into the night sky. It grew into a towering column of smoke.
   The extent of damage, and the type and quantity of weaponry
destroyed, was not immediately known.
   Reporters were unable to visit the spot because of a 10 p.m.-to-4
a.m. curfew imposed by the government.
   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said Sunday that
as many as 50 rockets hit the capital during the week, killing at
least 15 people.
   The insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to back the
government. Their withdrawal was mandated under a U.S.-mediated
accord, and the Red Army completed the pullout on Feb. 15.
   The guerrillas attacked Jalalabad, Afghanistan's fifth-largest
city, on March 6 in their first major assault after the Soviet
withdrawal. The city would provide the insurgents with a seat for
the government they formed in Pakistan, where they have their
headquarters.
   On Saturday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said
government troops were in complete control of Jalalabad and
surrounding hills, giving them a strategic advantage over the rebels.
   He also said government forces backed by a tank regiment had
destroyed guerrilla bases and killed 81 insurgents as they advanced
two miles to come within 32 miles of the Pakistan border.
   The government reports could not be independently confirmed.

<HEAD>Housewares Show: Lightning Bolt Hair and Microwave Tie-Dye</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lightning-bolt hair, microwave tie-dying and palm
trees that dance to music were among the brave new possibilities
offered at a national trade show Sunday.
   Thousands of gadgets and appliances from more than 600 producers
were on display at the National Housewares Manufacturers Association
show.
   The three-day show, which ends Tuesday, brings producers and
buyers together and allows for a midyear assessment of the
housewares industry as the Christmas buying season approaches.
   ``Personal care is a billion-dollar business, kitchen electric is
multibillion,'' said Frank Lindsey, vice president for marketing of
Conair Corp. of Stamford, Conn. Both are among the multitude of
products considered housewares.
   One trend appears to be putting patterns in hair, and the
appliance industry is trying to stay one jump ahead of demand.
   Enter Impressions, a waffle iron-like device made by Conair that
embosses designs like jagged lightning bolts in hair. Its suggested
retail price is $29.95.
   Want to tie-dye a T-shirt, but short of time? There's Micro-Dye,
a $3.49 kit by Dylon Corp. of Youngsville, N.C., that allows one to
tie-dye in a microwave oven in four minutes.
   ``It's a 60s to the 90s look,'' said Scott Krueger of Dylon.
   The Zojirushi Home Bakery is ``the next stop'' in automatic
bread-making machines, said show spokeswoman Susan Fleishman. In
addition to fresh bread, the $325 appliance makes jam, cake and
frosting.
   ``It's very much for the sophisticated cook,'' said Ms. Fleishman.
   For sore muscles or tired feet, there's the personal massager,
another item on the move. Massagers were a $30 million industry last
year, and producers are expected to double that by the end of 1989.
   ``Massagers have been more popular in Japan and Europe, and it's
time the U.S. woke up,'' said Richard Stern of Associated Mills Inc.
of Chicago, which sells under the brand name of Pollenex.
   ``We've come out with 16 new products this year,'' Stern said,
``and the twist massager is going to be a tremendous product.'' The
42-inch rope-type device goes for a suggested price of $29.95.

   The investigation of the deaths of four
children seemed to have hit a dead end seven years ago, until a
newspaper reporter's questions led an officer to read through the
file and reopen the case.
   Now Martha Ann Johnson, 34, who originally blamed her children's
deaths on bad luck, has been accused of killing them in separate
incidents from 1977 to 1982. Formal charges were filed last week in
three of the deaths, and police say she has confessed to the fourth
death.
   Police say Mrs. Johnson smothered the children, at least twice
after fights with her then-husband, but at the time of the deaths
they did not have solid evidence to back their suspicions and bring
charges.
   Authorities have said the case originally fell through the cracks
when officials failed to communicate with one another. Police,
social and medical agencies in Fulton and Clayton counties were
involved.
   ``The `cracks' did result in part from the number of agencies and
crossing jurisdictional lines,'' Clayton District Attorney Robert E.
Keller said. ``But you've got to acknowledge also there were flaws
in what was done.''
   A few hours before her arrest last Monday, police say, Mrs.
Johnson confessed to investigators from neighboring Clayton County
to killing 2-year-old James William Taylor in 1977 and 11-year-old
Jennyann Wright in 1982.
   She was indicted Thursday in Clayton County on charges of
murdering Jennyann, and also 3-month-old Tibitha Janeel Bowen in
1980 and 3-year-old Earl Wayne Bowen in 1981. James died in Fulton
County and that case will be handled there, said Fulton County
District Attorney Lewis Slaton.
   The case was placed on ``no lead'' status in 1982, leaving it
dormant, because there ``just wasn't enough to go with,'' said
Clayton County police Maj. Jerry Robinson. The deaths of Tibitha and
James, for example, were originally attributed by medical examiners
to sudden infant death syndrome.
   The investigation was reopened in December after an inquiry about
the case by a reporter from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution who was
doing a story on how government agencies handle deaths of juveniles,
Robinson said. County police Director Ronnie Clackum reviewed the
case file and decided to reopen the investigation, he said.
   ``What we did when we reopened the case, we went back to square
one,'' Robinson said. He would not comment on specific evidence, but
said the new investigation included interviews with people who were
not included in the first investigation.
   ``We wanted to make sure everything was in line before we
interviewed Mrs. Johnson,'' Robinson said. Since the time of the
last death, she had remarried and moved to Locust Grove, a town of
about 2,000 some 45 miles south of Atlanta.
   Mrs. Johnson and her new husband do not have children of their
own.
   Jennyann reportedly asked for help from her natural father and a
social worker, but was returned to her mother after being placed for
a time with another relative. She was found Feb. 21, 1982, face down
on her mother's bed, dead from what medical examiners at the time
called ``unexplained asphyxia.''
   ``You'd have to say the system failed in this,'' Keller said.
   Police have refused to say how Mrs. Johnson allegedly killed the
children, though the Atlanta newspaper reported that in at least two
cases she is suspected of having smothered them with her body.
   ``It seems that every time that she would get into an argument
with her husband and he would leave, something would happen to one
of the children,'' Robinson said.
   During the first investigation, Robinson said, there were ``real
strong feelings'' that a crime had been committed. And pathologists'
reports at the time made note of the previous deaths, he said.
   But he noted that to arrest someone, there must be probable cause
that a crime was committed. After the children died, he said, police
``went to the prosecutors that were handling this case and presented
what they had to them. It was just a general feeling that there just
wasn't enough to go with.''

<HEAD>Allegations of Fraud Cloud Results of July 2 Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Election officials Sunday began releasing
results of last week's elections in five states, and the returns
favored the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. The
opposition accused the party of vote fraud.
   In the border city of Ciudad Juarez, the conservative National
Action Party, or PAN, alleged massive irregularities and pulled out
of the vote count.
   The ruling party, known as the PRI, had proclaimed victory all
week in the overwhelming majority of state and local races held on
July 2.
   The exception was Baja California, where the PRI gave up a
governor's seat for the first time in its 60-year history.
   Despite that defeat and PAN's allegations of fraud, the PRI had
repeatedly insisted it had maintained control of the state assembly
and Baja's city halls.
   In the northern state of Chihuahua, the State Election Commission
said Sunday the PRI had won all 67 city hall races, including the
one in Ciudad Juarez, and 17 of the 18 state assembly races.
   On the Yucatan Peninsula, the Campeche State Election Commission
announced a PRI sweep of the state assemby races. The election
commission in the northern state of Zacatecas did the same.
   Elsewhere, the official count continued and results in some areas
were not expected for days.
   In the central state of Michoacan, contested campaigns by the PRI
and its archrival, the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, were
followed by competing claims of victory and charges of fraud and
voter intimidation.
   ``We won't give up a single vote,'' the PRI chairman in Michoacan
state, Fausto Vallejo, said Sunday as the state election commission
continued to tally the vote.
   The Michoacan elections were seen as a key contest between the
PRI and its leftist opposition.
   The official counts that began Sunday involve adding up the tally
sheets made by poll officials, who counted the ballots on election
day. In the two most hotly contested states, Baja California and
Michoacan, opposition parties had representatives watching the
actual ballot count at most polling places.
   The parties say their victory claims are based on the tallies
reported by their poll watchers and election workers.
   PRI's historic concession in the Baja governor's race dominated
the news here and abroad, drawing praise for President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari and his move toward democratic reform. It also
overshadowed other races and the opposition charges of fraud.
   In 60 years of unbroken PRI rule that stretched from local
election commissions to the tiniest city halls to the presidency,
vote fraud had become so common that a whole vocabulary of slang
arose to describe ways to rig elections.

   A Northwest Airlines jetliner with 222
people aboard made an emergency landing minutes after takeoff Sunday
because of smoke in the cockpit.
   The Minneapolis-bound DC-10 returned to San Francisco
International Airport at 12:55 p.m. after dumping fuel over San
Francisco Bay, air traffic control manager Michael Corbett said at
the Air Traffic Control Center in Fremont.
   Passengers got off the plane upon its return to the terminal for
repairs.
   ``It turned out to be a minor smoke problem ... so it's no big
deal,'' Corbett said.
   The smoke was attributed to oil spilling on the engine, an
airport spokesman said. The smoke then was drawn through the
aircraft's air conditioning system, said Kevin Whalen, director of
corporate communications for Northwest in Eagan, Minn.

   President George Bush's arrival at Warsaw
Military Airport on a sweltering summer night included a
goose-stepping military honor guard, a Solidarity representative and
a bit of Polish speaking by the president.
   ``Czolem,'' Bush shouted in a firm voice to the high-booted
troops who formed the honor guard. The traditional military greeting
usually is translated as ``hail.''
   ``Hail, Mr. President,'' the troops shouted back in Polish.
   The nation was able to watch Bush's long-anticipated arrival live
on television, from the time Air Force One taxied onto the runway at
10:01 p.m. until his motorcade left for a government guest house on
the edge of a Warsaw park.
   Poland is in the midst of a rare summer heat wave, with
temperatures in the 90s. Through the open windows in city streets,
the broadcast of Bush arriving could be heard coming from almost
every apartment.
   Polish Communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, looking
excited, greeted the smiling president as he came down the steps of
the U.S. jet, accompanied by his wife, Barbara.
   Also present were young boy and girl scouts, who presented Bush a
bouquet of red and white roses, the colors that make up the Polish
flag. ``This kid speaks beautiful English,'' Bush could be heard
saying about one child.
   In a sign of the historic changes that have take place in Poland
in recent weeks, one of the first dignitaries in the line to greet
Bush was Andrzej Wielowieyski, deputy speaker of Poland's new freely
elected Senate and a senior adviser to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   It was the first time a Solidarity representative has been on
hand for an official state welcome ceremony. As he waited,
Wielowieyski mingled easily with members of the government.
   In his brief welcoming remarks, Jaruzelski, wearing a civilian
suit, told Bush, ``You are coming to a land in which a process of
fundamental changes is underway.''
   Bush replied, ``There is a great deal of work to be done. And we
will work together to gain new ground, to expand our common
ground...Long live Poland.''
   Then the army and air force troops, carrying sabres and rifles
with shiny bayonets, goose-stepped away as Bush and Jaruzelski
looked on.
   Crowds lined the road leading from the airport to watch Bush's
speeding motorcade pass.
   ``He's a terrific guy. We're very happy he came, but he went by
too fast,'' joked a middle-age female office worker after the column
of dozens of cars sped past.
   ``For Poland, this is a very important thing, a visit from the
president of the United States,'' said a professor watching near his
home in the city's Ochota district. ``The emotional support is the
most important thing ... We also hope there will be some monetary
deal'' from the visit.
   The professor's neighbor, an English teacher, said, ``Everyone
expects...Some arrangements to help us out of this economic crisis.''
   She added that as an educator, she looks forward to more student
exchanges with the United States.

   Thirty-two percent of Americans would not vote
for a candidate who advocated restricting access to abortions, while
24 percent would not support one who favored abortion, according to
a poll released Sunday.
   The Time magazine-CNN poll also found that 57 percent of those
surveyed do not believe the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn its
ruling in Roe vs. Wade, while 61 percent disagree with its decision
last Monday to uphold a Missouri law restricting abortion.
   A Newsweek poll released Saturday found the court's decision on
the Missouri law _ which cleared the way for other states to
restrict abortion _ met with disapproval by 53 percent of Americans,
while 37 percent approved.
   The Time poll found only 31 percent favor new state laws
restricting access to abortions, while 57 percent oppose such
limitations. Fifty-two percent of the people polled by Newsweek said
they believed their states would pass new laws.
   The Time-CNN poll was conducted by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman on
Thursday. A total of 504 adults were interviewed by telephone. The
margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

   The Supreme Court decision giving states new
authority to restrict abortions means a new round of fights in the
states about the contentious issue, two women on opposite sides of
the dispute agreed Sunday.
   ``It's the voters who are going to hold the candidates to a new
level of accountability and they're going to lose their jobs,'' said
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League.
   Susan Smith, associate legislative director for the National
Right to Life Committee, disagreed. ``We've proven that the pro-life
margin is enough to help elect pro-life representatives.''
   But Ms. Michelman disputed that, saying, ``no, no, no, no, no.''
   The debate occurred on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   The disagreement by the women mirrored comments a week ago in the
wake of the 5-4 Supreme Court decision which said the states could
have new authority to restrict abortion. Representatives of both
sides said the fight would now turn to state legislatures.
   Ms. Smith said, ``we're going to do what we've been doing for the
past 16 years(since the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortions).
   ``We have a very strong grassroots organization in place, which
has been very active in helping to pass protective legislation, the
kind of legislation that's finally been upheld by the Supreme Court
after years of striking down even minimal restrictions.''
   ``There are a lot of people out there who for many years now have
felt that they have been unable to do anything about this issue,''
she said. ``What the Supreme Court did was to return aspects of this
issue back to the democratic processes and the people.''
   But Ms. Michelman said, ``you know the lives and health of women
should not depend on the accident of their residency any more than
the right of the freedom of the press should depend on where a
newspaper is published.''
   ``We may have lost faith in five justices of the court, but we
have not lost faith in the American public,'' she said.
   She said one target will be Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who said
he is willing to call the Florida legislature into special session
to write new restrictions on abortion.
   Martinez said he expects intensive lobbying from both sides.
   ``I suspect that it will be very aggressive, no question about
it, from both sides,'' he said. ``I would hope that we each enjoy
the freedom of speech, but do it without harm to anyone, without
damaging public or private property, that we communicate our
thoughts and be as aggressive as you like. I know it's an aggressive
kind of issue.''
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin of Vermont said ``I hope we can develop
another way that we don't have to just respond emotionally, that we
can realize the world has changed, and women have become used to the
idea that our present day other choices of freedom include the idea
of choosing when, whether they want to have children.''

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 6th graf to CORRECT that sanctions recommended against
Benton</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three former government housing officials
reaped millions in ``unjustified profits'' and increased costs in
two troubled housing programs through a mortgage company suspended
from government work because of questionable business practices, a
federal audit says.
   The three _ including Philip Winn, now ambassador to Switzerland
_ are among those who capitalized on their knowledge of the housing
programs and the lender's lax enforcement of government regulations.
   They formed a joint development venture after working briefly at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development. That venture was
called Winn and Associates, which according to another HUD audit,
was the development company involved in one of the projects.
   The mortgage on the project was insured by a company known as
Benton Mortage.
   The audit by HUD's inspector general detailed how the trio used
``paper'' corporations to increase their profits, and how Benton
Mortgage used improper calculations to inflate mortgages and rent
subsidies paid by the government.
   The audit does not accuse the three former officials of criminal
wrongdoing, but recommends internal administrative sanctions against
Benton Mortgage.
   A company spokesman said Benton's loan portfolio is sound, that
it has not defaulted on any HUD coinsured loans and that the company
has already filed a 2,500-page response to the HUD audit.
   The inspector general audited 14 projects in the agency's
moderate rehabilitation program financed and coinsured by Benton
Mortgage, located in Knoxville, Tenn., and found that in none of the
cases did the lender follow HUD rules or ``prudent underwriting
practices.''
   Three of those projects were developed by companies partly owned
by Winn, who served one year as an assistant HUD secretary and
federal housing commissioner before being appointed ambassador to
Switzerland by former President Reagan.
   Two other former HUD officials, Philip Abrams and J. Michael
Queenan, were partners with Winn in one of the projects, the
160-apartment Sierra Pointe complex in Las Vegas, Nev.
   The report, which did not name the owners of the development
companies, said Benton ``manipulated rents and appraised values'' to
get the highest allowable mortgage for the Sierra Pointe project.
   According to the report, Benton overestimated Sierra Pointe's
anticipated rents and the property's value by including the
government assistance and overstating the sales prices of two
comparable properties.
   That resulted in a Benton-approved, coinsured mortgage for Sierra
Pointe that the audit said was $2.5 million more than it should have
been.
   A House subcommittee headed by Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., is
investigating a number of HUD activities, including whether the
moderate rehabilitation program has been used in some projects to
jack up the mortgage value.
   The moderate rehabilitation and mortgage coinsurance programs are
among four that recently have been suspended, revised or restricted
by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp after inspector general's reports
revealed evidence of widespread abuse and mismanagement during the
Reagan administration.
   ``Our portfolio is sound,'' Benton spokesman Tom Reid told The
Associated Press, adding the company has not defaulted on any of its
HUD coinsured loans.
   HUD faces about $650 million in coinsured loan defaults from
several mortgage companies whose practices now are under review.
   ``We specialize in low-income housing and the people we financed
just happened to be those guys,'' Reid added.
   Reid said the company already had made ``a 2,500-page,
four-volume'' response to the IG's audit, which he would not discuss
further.
   Another Winn group project was singled out as an example of
Benton's aiding in the ``pyramiding of profits'' by contractors and
subcontractors through ``contrived identities of interests and paper
conduit companies.''
   In that instance, Sundance Housing Associates, Ltd., a company
Winn listed as part of his holdings on a 1988 financial disclosure
form, owned 25 percent of the Sierra Vista Apartments in Arapahoe
County, Colo. The form also showed the company was formed and then
sold in 1987 after the project was completed.
   Sundance Housing selected Mead Associates, Inc. as the contractor
to rehabilitate Sierra Vista. Mead then formed M.A. Builders Inc. as
a construction company with common ownership. Sundance Housing and
M.A. Builders then formed Sundance Builders, Inc.
   Sundance Builders then became the general contractor and Mead a
subcontractor.
   Property owners and developers with common interests are eligible
for certain profit and risk allowances in HUD's coinsurance program.
   However, the agency doesn't allow for the added profit or
overhead costs when a subcontractor appears to be a ``paper''
corporation, a company with no demonstrated ability in the field or
no significant business outside its sphere of interest.
   Investigators determined that all three prohibitive conditions
existed on the Sierra Vista project and four others and concluded
that ``unjustified profits totaled $1,442,296 for the five
projects.''
   A 202-unit project at the Windsong apartments in Tulsa, Okla.,
another Winn group project, also was among the five cited for the
``paper'' corporations scheme in the audit.
   ``The arrangements should not have been approved,'' the auditors
concluded.
   Other names and projects connected with alleged
influence-peddling and favoritism in the moderate rehabilitation
program show up in Benton's portfolio of questionable coinsured
loans cited by the inspector general.
   They include the 316-unit Pebble Creek Apartments project
developed by Gerald Carmen, former director of the General Services
Administration, and the Four Seasons Apartments in Gastonia, N.C.
   Joseph Strauss, former executive assistant to then-HUD Secretary
Samuel Pierce, and Judith Siegel, a developer who paid former
Interior Secretary James Watt $300,000 as a consultant on one
project, were paid $123,000 as consultants on the Four Seasons
project.
   The Siegel-Watt project at the Kingsley Park Apartments in Essex,
Md. was also among those that used ``paper'' corporations to build
in excessive profits and overhead, to the tune of $336,373.
   The inspector general found actions by the Knoxville lender
``resulted in material misrepresentation of mortgage amounts and
rents'' that will force the government to overpay rent subsidies
estimated at $37 million for the 15-year life of the housing
assistance contracts.
   In addition, mortgages to moderate rehabilitation projects
coinsured by Benton and the government were excessive by $22
million, the report said.
   The inspector general recommended HUD's Mortgage Review Board
``take appropriate sanctions'' against Benton.
   The company has been barred from making additional loans under
the coinsurance program until Nov. 1 and HUD spokesman Jack Flynn
said the review board is expected to take up the Benton case in
mid-July.
   Although Inspector General Paul Adams had said last week Benton
was under grand jury investigation, Pat Neri, assistant inspector
general for investigations, said HUD has shared its audit
information with the Justice Department which would decide whether
there is evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Gas Prices Down Despite Summer Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices continued an uncharacteristic
summer decline caused by increased oil and gasoline supplies, an
analyst said Sunday.
   The nation's average retail price for a gallon of gasoline was
$1.16.76 on July 7, a decrease of 1.67 cents since early June, said
Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the biweekly Lundberg Survey of 12,000
gas stations.
   The price has dropped because refiners, terminal operators and
importers had increased supplies to meet new federal clean-air
regulations, Lundberg said.
   ``The drop reflects efforts on the part of the oil industry to
step up their gasoline production and imports of gasoline during May
and June in order to avoid any supply tightness or shortage,''
Lundberg said.
   Lundberg said that higher demand by summer drivers and policy
changes in other oil producing nations could still push prices
higher later this year.
   Gasoline reached its peak average price of $1.18.43 per gallon on
May 19, a sharp rise at the time from the average price of 98.04
cents in early January, the survey found.
   At the self-service pump July 7, regular unleaded gasoline cost
an average of $1.06.78 per gallon, while premium cost $1.22.52 per
gallon and regular leaded was $1.06.12 per gallon.
   For full-service gasoline, the average cost for unleaded was
$1.32.11 per gallon, premium cost $1.44.03 per gallon and regular
leaded was $1.30.5 per gallon.

otherwise fine, authorities said. He had gone into the foothills of
the Cascade Range on Friday on an imaginary fishing trip with a
neighbor's dogs, two adult Australian shepherd dogs and a small
white puppy.
   ``I knew that if any 3-year-old could survive, Joe could do it,''
said his his tearful mother, Judy Leffler, 38.
   Joseph probably survived by sleeping with the dogs, said Robert
L. Norton, an emergency room physician at the hospital.
   The boy, dressed in a short-sleve shirt, pants and high-top
sneakers, left his house about 1 p.m. Friday. He carried a 3-foot
length of plastic pipe to use as a pretend fishing pole.
   He was reported missing after he failed to return from Fall
Creek, just 200 feet away from the family home.
   The boy's father, Daniel Leffler, said he didn't lose hope that
his son would be found safe because the two had spent a lot of time
together in the woods. He said he had a lot of confidence in the
dogs, which belonged to Virgil Williams, a family friend with whom
the Lefflers had been staying for about six weeks.
   ``Virgil told us, `Don't worry, my dogs will sleep with him and
keep him warm,'' said Leffler. The boy later said he'd slept with
the dogs both nights and that they'd helped him find his way out of
the woods.
   Lt. Neil James of the Clackamas County sheriff's office estimated
300 people were involved in the search Sunday morning. The effort
included several teams of tracking dogs and a helicopter from the
Air Force Reserve's 304th Air Rescue and Recovery Squadron in
Portland.
   The boy came into view about a three-fourths of a mile from where
he disappeared. The dogs were trotting alongside.
   A helicopter took Joseph to Oregon Health Sciences University
Hospital, where doctors said he would stay overnight for observation.
   The youngster gave a ``thumbs up'' sign to onlookers at the
hospital.

<HEAD>Dolphin Found Dead in Hudson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dolphin that spent more than a week in city
waters, resisting efforts to herd it back to sea, was found dead
Sunday in the Hudson River nearly 50 miles north of here.
   The bottlenose dolphin was found floating off the town of
Garrison on the east side of the river, said marine biologist Samuel
Sadove of the Okeanos Ocean Research Foundation, which rescues
stranded sea mammals.
   The sea mammal was alive Saturday, Sadove said in a telephone
interview.
   An autopsy was to be performed on the gray, 5-foot-long animal at
an Okeanos laboratory in Hampton Bays on Long Island, where the
organization is based.
   Sadove declined to speculate on what caused the animal's death,
but said it was not unexpected. He said last week that its condition
had noticeably deteriorated. The dolphin's skin was peeling due to
the lack of salt in the Hudson.
   The dolphin, of the same species as the dolphin that appeared in
the television show ``Flipper,'' was first spotted June 20 in the
East River off Manhattan.
   It stayed in the river for 11 days, attracting a steady stream of
curious onlookers.
   The dolphin resisted efforts by biologists who tried to herd it
back into the Atlantic Ocean by banging on pipes in the water.
   Two weeks ago, it headed north up the Hudson. Scientists had
planned to capture the dolphin Tuesday and take it to the sea.

   Boris Becker beat Stefan Edberg in
straight sets Sunday, to win his third Wimbledon title in five
years, and Steffie Graf won her second straight title in the women's
final, overcoming Martina Navratilova.
   Becker avenged his loss to Edberg last year, winning the
championship rematch 6-0, 7-6, 6-4, the most one-sided final since
John McEnroe allowed Jimmy Connors only four games in 1984.
   The 21-year old West German regained the title he won in 1985 and
1986.
   Graf, for the second year in a row, halted eight-time champion
Navratilova's bid for a record ninth Wimbledon singles title 6-2,
6-7, 6-1. It was her sixth victory in the last seven Grand Slams.
   Graf, 20, who lost to teen-age Arantxa Sanchez in the French Open
final last month, sat in her sideline chair on Centre Court after
the victory, bowed her head and sobbed.
   ``I wanted it so badly that I put a little more pressure on
myself than usual,'' Graf said. ``It's an overwhelming feeling.''
   The women's final was postponed from Saturday because of rain and
darkness, putting both finals on the same day for only the 10th time
in Wimbledon history.

<HEAD>`Twelfth Night,' All-Star Shakespeare, Opens in Central Park</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widely publicized all-star revival of
``Twelfth Night'' by the New York Shakespeare Festival is bawdy,
boisterous, even boorish _ an idiosyncratic, often low comedy
jokefest that sacrifices love, not to mention Shakespeare, for
laughs.
   The reason? There are a lot of stars on stage at the Delacorte
Theater in Central Park, where ``Twelfth Night'' opened Sunday, and
director Harold Guskin has encouraged them to revel in their own
eccentricities, no matter what it does to the play.
   Because of that directive, the production belongs to the
strongest performers, in this case, Gregory Hines, a consummate song
and dance man. Hines, dressed to look like a mummer in a
Philadelphia New Year's Day parade, plays Feste, the fool.
   Feste dominates the evening, even making the quartet of lovers _
Viola and Orsino, Olivia and Sebastian _ seem like supporting
characters. Out the window goes much of the play's ideas about
romance, particularly concerning sexual identity and illusion as
well as its more thoughtful moments about death and reconciliation.
   Viola, dressed as a boy, still pines for Orsino who longs for
Olivia who sighs for the young man Viola pretends to be. And Viola's
long-lost twin brother Sebastian still arrives to straighten out the
mess. But they all seem secondary to the comic business at hand.
   Most of that business, fortunately, concerns Hines who has the
grace, style and personality to get away with just about anything,
even dropping his pants or dancing with surprised female members of
the audience.
   He's helped in the comic antics by John Amos, a gruff,
inarticulate Sir Toby Belch, and Fisher Stevens as the effete Sir
Andrew Aguecheek. Stevens displays a goofy charm accentuated by a
straw-blond wig that makes him look like a dissipated Breck shampoo
girl.
   Jeff Goldblum gives the production's strangest performance.
Playing Malvolio, Olivia's villainous steward and would-be suitor,
Goldblum scampers around the large stage as if he were auditioning
to replace Mikhail Baryshnikov as the cockroach in
``Metamorphosis.'' His speaking voice is even stranger. Oozing
insincerity, he affects a sing-song, stop-and-go cadence that
obliterates any sense of Shakespeare's language.
   Michelle Pfeiffer, a wan, indifferent Olivia, also tramples many
of her speeches, rushing through them before she finds herself out
of breath. There is more life _ and feel for the language _ to be
found in Charlaine Woodard as Olivia's sprightly maid Maria.
   Stephen Collins as a stuffy, even sexist Orsino and Graham Winton
as Sebastian are adequate but bland. The best member of the quartet
of lovers is Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. She conveys Viola's sense
of sexual confusion and desperation in great comic style, but the
actress doesn't neglect the music to be found in Shakespeare's
moonstruck poetry.
   Director Guskin has set the play at the turn of the century in a
Mediterranean country, not unlike Monaco. It allows costume designer
Jeanne Button to provide some elaborate costumes. And set designer
John Lee Beatty has conjured up a peach-colored marble gazebo that
dominates one side of the stage, with a tiny replica of Olivia's
house perched on a rocky cliff on the other side of the playing area.
   ``Twelfth Night'' ends with a wistful song by Feste, delivered by
Hines with great feeling. It releases a wide range of emotions that
are missing from the mostly one-note, relentless buffoonery that
precedes it.

<TEXT>
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino
heard strong criticism of human rights violations in her country
when she arrived in West Germany on Sunday.
   Beginning a three-nation tour to encourage a greater European
role in the development of the Philippines, Mrs. Aquino traveled to
West Berlin, where she met with Mayor Walter Momper.
   ``It would be insincere not to mention that many people in this
city are concerned over the persistent and growing violations of
human rights in the Philippines,'' Momper said at a reception for
Mrs. Aquino.
   Momper cited ``arbitrary arrests, murders and disappearances of
people, and torture.''
   He also praised Mrs. Aquino's struggle for political change by
peaceful means after 20 years of rule by ousted President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   In brief remarks to West German television reporters, Mrs. Aquino
said her government was committed to protecting human rights. She
said violations were not widespread and that most attacks on
civilians were carried out by communist insurgents, not by
government forces.
   Mrs. Aquino's talks with West German leaders begin on Monday,
when she is to meet President Richard von Weizsaecker and Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. On Tuesday, she will meet with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Mrs. Aquino's weeklong tour will also take her to France and
Belgium.

   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
traveled to Caracas Sunday afternoon aboard a Cuban plane for a
two-hour airport meeting with President Carlos Andres Perez, sources
said.
   Two photographers and a reporter from a Caracas newspaper were
arrested by soldiers guarding the runaway at Maiquetia airport as
they tried to approach the plane. Other reporters were expelled from
the building.
   The three arrested were released about an hour later.
   Ortega landed at 6 p.m. on a Cuban-owned, Soviet-made Ilyushin
jet on his way back from the inauguration of President Carlos Menem
of Argentina. The plane departed 10 minutes after the meeting ended.
   The subject of the talks was not known. Sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity said they may have centered on the 1980 San
Jose agreement, under which Venezuela and Mexico sell oil to Central
American and Caribbean nations on easier terms. Nicaragua was
excluded from the agreement seven years ago for non-payment.
   Perez and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, in
Venezuela on a three-day visit, Monday were to sign an accord
extending the agreement for another year.

<TEXT>
   A lightning-sparked fire raged out of
control Sunday along a 20-mile front in northwestern Nebraska,
threatening the community of Crawford and forcing evacuation of a
hospital, a nursing home and a park.
   Gov. Kay Orr issued an emergency declaration for the area, making
state money available, and ordered about 30 National Guardsmen to
help an estimated 150 firefighters battle the blaze.
   The blaze also threatened the site of a former Army cavalry post
where Sioux Chief Crazy Horse was killed.
   The fire burned to within 1{ miles of the city of 1,300 and
authorities feared a shift in the wind could endanger the town.
   The fire started Saturday on the west side of Fort Robinson State
Park and Park Superintendent Vince Rotherham estimated that 10,000
to 12,000 acres trees, scrub and grassland in the 22,000-acre park's
rugged canyons had burned. It also had charred part of an adjoining
wildlife refuge and private land.
   ``It looks really bad. A lot of those trees are 150 years old.
... It will take 100 years to rebuild it,'' Rotherham said.
   The blaze grew to about 20 miles long and six miles wide, had
burned 50,000 to 100,000 acres and was far from contained, said
deputy state fire marshal Jerry Larson.
   ``We could see whole lines of trees exploding,'' said Marc
Anthony, a state game and parks commissioner who flew over the fire.
A mushroom cloud of smoke could be seen from Scottsbluff about 90
miles away.
   ``It's not a pretty sight,'' said Mrs. Orr, who flew along the
perimeter of the blaze. ``There's so much, only so much that can be
done, and they're doing everything humanly possible,''
   In addition to a rugged landscape of buttes as high as 4,900 feet
and long, narrow canyons, temperatures around 90 degrees and
variable wind complicated firefighting efforts, officials said.
   ``Everything was against us,'' Rotherham said. ``It's been
extremely hot. When it hit, it just kind of exploded things. This
area is extremely rough _ they couldn't get to it.''
   About 150 firefighters from about 25 to 30 departments from
Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming were fighting the blaze, he said.
   About midday, the fire inside the park was within one-half mile
of historic Fort Robinson, the former cavalry post where Crazy Horse
was killed by guards in 1877, Rotherham said.
   Larson said an undetermined number of private cabins had burned
in the sparsely populated area.
   Crawford Hospital treated several people for minor injuries, said
nursing supervisor Jacqueline Skavdahl.
   Earlier, the four patients at the hospital were taken by bus to
the Chadron Community Hospital because of the smoke and closeness of
the flames, said Kathy Wigington, Chadron director of nursing
services. And about 25 residents of the Ponderosa Villa nursing home
were taken to a dormitory at Chadron State College.
   ``The elderly people are at higher risk. They don't breathe as
well,'' said Kathy Owen, director of nursing services at the nursing
home.
   More than 600 visitors were evacuated from the campgrounds, lodge
and cabins at Fort Robinson State Park because of the shifting wind
and smoke, although authorities said there was no immediate danger
to the tourist facilities, said Rotherham.
   ``It was extremely smoky, just so you could just about breathe,''
Rotherham said.
   State Sen. Sandy Scofield, who lives on a ranch near Chadron,
said the fire was the worst she has seen in the area.
   ``There have been three big fires out here in 15 years and right
now I think that this is probably the worst of all of them,'' she
said Sunday.
   Scofield said the rough country will hamper firefighting efforts.
   ``I don't know how they can go about fighting a fire like that,''
she said. ``It's been very dry out here.''

   A 16-year-old girl charged at a robber who
was holding an ax to her mother's throat, saving her mother but
getting slashes that required 200 stitches, authorities said.
   ``He said, `If you scream again, I'll hit you even harder,' and I
just screamed louder,'' said Rose Lacy as she recovered from
Saturday's attack at her family's copy business. ``I saw blood
everywhere but I didn't know how badly I was hurt.''
   ``All I could think of was that I had to get that ax away from my
mother's neck,'' she said.
   Alvin Haynes, a 32-year-old ex-convict who has been living at a
nearby halfway house, was arrested Sunday and was being held at the
city jail, Lt. John Brunner said.
   Haynes was taken into custody after his sister called police and
said her brother was ready to turn himself in, Brunner said.
   Brunner said the assailant entered the Rose Copy shop _ named for
the girl _ about noon and asked to use the bathroom. He apparently
opened a tool box inside the store, took out an ax and held it to
the throat of Rose's 33-year-old mother, Melody Lacy.
   Rose leaped at the man's arm, but he knocked her down and struck
her twice with the 4{-inch blade. Despite the gashes across her
cheek and the back of her head, the girl jumped to her feet and
chased the robber around the store.
   The man then grabbed cash that had been placed on a counter and
ran away, police said. The amount of money taken was not disclosed.
   Mrs. Lacy said her daughter's attacker ``seemed frightened when
she got up and started chasing him with half her face falling off.''
   Rose Lacy was treated and released at San Francisco General
Hospital, where she received 200 stitches.

   A painter held for questioning in the slaying of a
Kansas woman and the disappearances of three others was talkative,
but isn't giving authorities anything they can make a case on, a
police chief said.
   ``He's not a dummy. He'll admit to things, but not to the point
that it implicates him,'' said Wichita, Kan., Police Chief Rick
Stone, who was in Dallas on personal business when Richard Grissom
Jr. was arrested Friday.
   Grissom, who remained jailed without bond Sunday, said he knew
the three missing women, Stone said.
   The 28-year-old house painter planned a date with Terri Maness,
25, of Wichita the night of June 7, when she was strangled and
stabbed in her townhouse, Kansas authorities said.
   Grissom was being held at Lew Sterrett Justice Center for alleged
parole violations, said Dallas County sheriff's Lt. Gary Lindsey.
Grissom has not been charged in the slaying or the disappearances.
   A hearing was scheduled for Monday to begin extradition
proceedings, Lindsey said.
   On Saturday Grissom, acting on his attorneys' advice, refused to
sign papers allowing his extradition to Kansas City, even though he
earlier agreed to cooperate with authorities.
   Members of the Overland Park, Kan., Metro Squad, who'd planned to
take the suspect back to the Kansas City suburb Saturday, returned
home empty-handed.
   ``He is going to be here for a while,'' said Lindsey. Extradition
can take 60 to 90 days.
   Officials with north Texas law enforcement agencies questioned
Grissom about unsolved slayings in their region, but he didn't
provide much information, authorities said.
   Grissom was arrested at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport
on an anonymous tip.
   An avid bodybuilder, Grissom was convicted at age 16 of
bludgeoning a 72-year-old Lansing, Kan., woman to death with a
railroad spike.
   Jewelry, credit cards and other belongings of at least one of the
missing women were recovered from a car at the airport which was
stolen in Missouri and which Grissom allegedly drove to Texas, said
Overland Metro Squad Detective Larry Keller.
   Police want to question him about the disappearances of Lexena,
Kan., roommates Christine A. Rusch and Theresa J. Brown, both 22,
said Keller. The suburban Kansas City women were reported missing
June 26.
   Overland police began seeking Grissom June 27 in the
disappearance of 24-year-old Joan Butler, who was reported missing
June 16.
   Grissom is on parole for a burglary and theft conviction in
Kansas.

   Six of the 10 richest people in the world are
Japanese but the United States still leads the world in the total
number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes
magazine.
   For the third straight year, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list
of private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much
as it had been 12 months earlier.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net
worth of at least $15 billion _ nearly $4 billion less than
estimated last summer due mainly to a rise in the value of the
dollar against other major currencies, Forbes said Sunday.
   The estimate was far greater than the $2.8 billion that Fortune
magazine placed as Tsutsumi's worth in its September 1988 ranking of
those it considered the world's richest people.
   In last year's list, Forbes estimated Tsutsumi's net worth as
$18.9 billion.
   The magazine reports in its July 24 issue that Tsutsumi edged out
second-ranked Taikichiro Mori by less than $1 billion.
   Mori, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings
in Tokyo, has an estimated net worth of $14.2 billion. In last
year's survey, Forbes placed Mori's worth at about $18 billion.
   The third-richest on the list was American Sam Moore Walton,
founder of the third-largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. Walton and his family are worth an estimated $8.7
billion, up from Forbes' 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.
   After the Waltons came Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of the
Olympia &amp; York real estate empire, with a combined net worth of
about $8 billion.
   The rest of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and
industries, according to Forbes, were: Shin Kyuk-ho, South Korea,
candy, real estate, $8 billion; Hirotomo Takei and family, Japan,
publishing, real estate, $7.8 billion; Kitaro Watanabe, Japan, real
estate, hotels, $7 billion-plus; Haruhiko Yoshimoto and family,
Japan, real estate, $7 billion; Hans and Gad Rausing, Sweden,
liquids packaging, $7 billion; and Eitaro Itoyama, Japan, land, $6.6
billion.
   Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the
world with personal assets worth more than $1 billion.
   The United States was the country with the most billionaires,
with 55 individuals qualifying for that title. Japan ranked second,
with 41, and West Germany was third with 20.
   American also accounted for the most billionaires in the 1988
survey, 47, followed by Japan's 32 and West Germany's 16.
   Among the richest of the world's rich are people who didn't
necessarily come by their money in an honest way.
   Colombia's cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away
piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit
margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years.
   Three of them made Forbes ``World Billionaires'' list, including
Pablo Escobar Gaviria, leader of the notorious Medellin cocaine
cartel, with an estimated personal net worth of $3 billion. The
other cocaine kingpins on the list were the Ochoa family, worth more
than $2 billion, and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, with more than $1
billion.
   In compiling its list, Forbes does not consider royal families
and heads of state ``because their wealth derives more from
political heritage than from economic effort _ theirs are feudal
fortunes, not capitalistic ones.''
   The magazine also excludes dictators, such as Cuba's Fidel Castro
or North Korea's Kim Il Sung.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Decline in Corporate Name Changes in First Half</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A few memorable names such as the Eastern
Airlines Air-Shuttle, The First Women's Bank and Gulf &amp; Western Inc.
disappeared from corporate record books in the first half of the
year.
   But overall, the number of U.S. companies that changed their
names fell 18 percent in the first six months of 1989 compared with
a year ago, the first such decline in four years, according to a
survey for release Monday.
   The identity consulting firm Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc.
attributed the decline to a slower pace of business merger activity
than a year earlier.
   The firm said 767 American companies changed their names in the
January through June period, down from a record 931 name changes in
the first six months of 1988. It was the first such decline since
1985.
   Despite the slower pace of merger activity, mergers and
acquisitions remained the most frequently cited reason for name
changes in the latest period, accounting for 351 changes, or 46
percent of the total.
   Corporate downsizing, spinoffs and asset sales accounted for 177
of the name changes or 23 percent of the total.
   The Air-Shuttle, for instance, was renamed the Trump Shuttle
after developer Donald Trump bought it from troubled Eastern.
   The survey said there were 139 elective name changes, or 18
percent of the total. Included among these were The Home Group
Inc.'s adoption of the name AmBase Corp., Middle South Utilities
Inc.'s change to Entergy Corp. and American Hoist &amp; Derrick Co.'s
switch to Amdura Corp.
   The remaining name changes were done to reflect corporate
restructuring or reorganization, changes to a holding company and
other assorted changes in legal status.
   Joel Portugal, a principal at Anspach Grossman Portugal, said
some companies are finding value in sticking with their names or a
shortened version of them rather than creating entirely new names.
   He said they have found an existing name ``can have real value,
like any other corporate asset.''
   He said F.W. Woolworth Co. appeared to be following that strategy
by streamlining its name to Woolworth Corp., and Eastern Gas &amp; Fuel
Associates did so by changing to Eastern Enterprises.
   Even Gulf &amp; Western, which became Paramount Communications Inc.
last month, turned to an old Hollywood name many people recognize,
Portugal said.
   New England Apple Products Co. Inc., a maker of bottled fruit
drinks, capitalized on its major brand name by changing to Veryfine
Products Inc., and Austin Rover Cars of North America became
Sterling Motor Cars.
   The number of thrifts, banks and other financial institutions
that changed their names fell to 195 in the latest six-month period,
down from 254 a year earlier, the survey stated.
   It said an increasing number of thrifts dropped the ``S&amp;L'' from
their names in favor of ``bank,'' possibly reflecting recent
concerns about the large number of thrifts that have required
federal assistance.
   One of the more unusual name changes by a bank was the decision
by The First Women's Bank to change its name to First New York Bank
for Business. The New York-based bank _ which formerly catered
almost exclusively to women customers _ said the change reflected
its belief that women no longer were discriminated against by other
banks and by a decision to expand into middle market commercial
lending.
   Overall, Anspach Grossman Portugal said, the number of
manufacturers changing their names outpaced changes by financial
institutions for the first time, 229 to 195.
   The next most frequent changes by industry were 64 in
communications, 57 in technology and 37 in retailing.

<HEAD>Ford Lowers Estimate of 1989 Industry Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has dropped its estimate of
the number of cars and light trucks likely to be sold this year
industrywide by up to 300,000 vehicles, further evidence of a
softening car market.
   Ford Chairman Donald Petersen on Friday lowered the company's
estimate to about 14.7 million from about 15 million cars and
trucks, an estimate the company held for months.
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca last month predicted a sales
year of 13.5 million to 14 million vehicles, with roughly two cars
being sold for every light truck. General Motors Corp. has held to
its 15 million vehicle estimate with the same breakdown between car
and truck sales.
   Petersen backed away from the car-to-truck ratio, saying he
expected truck sales this year to remain at last year's level of
about 5 million units. That means the reduction in sales volume
would come from the car market.
   ``I'm sure the June (sales) numbers were the thing that knocked
them off their pedestal, so to speak,'' said auto analyst Joseph
Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Earlier this week, Ford reported its domestic car sales during
June were running 12.3 percent behind the pace during the same month
last year. General Motors Corp.'s June car sales were 12.4 percent
lower than last year's and Chrysler Corp.'s were down 17.5 percent.
   But sales during June of last year were exceptionally strong,
mostly because of attractive incentives.
   This June incentives also were offered, but they didn't generate
the same kind of buying interest as they did in 1988, a fact
Petersen acknowledged Friday.
   Last year was the second-best sales year in industry history,
with 15.8 million cars and light trucks driven off dealership lots.
The 16.3 million vehicles sold in 1986 made that year the best in
history.
   Although he expected lower sales volume for the industry,
Petersen said it would still be a good year.
   ``The auto industry has been coming down gradually since its peak
in 1986,'' Petersen said after receiving an award as manager of the
year from the National Management Association.
   ``We've had quite a run here,'' Phillippi said of the past five
years of vehicle sales. ``We have been due for a correction.''
   While GM and Chrysler have been losing market share during the
past year, Ford has been gaining.
   Also on Friday, Petersen said more plant closings and layoffs are
possible during the third quarter beyond the normal breaks for
summer vacation and model changeovers. However, he addedm that he
didn't think the layoffs would be significant or long-lasting.

<HEAD>Greek Bank To Be Sued for $1.5 Billion By Angry Depositors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ROCKS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greek bank whose U.S.-based officers are charged
with racketeering bilked depositors of hundreds of millions of
dollars, an attorney alleged Sunday.
   The depositors plan to file a class-action lawsuit Monday seeking
$1.5 billion in damages from the National Mortgage Bank of Greece
and 14 of its officers, said Constantine Kangles, lead attorney in
the lawsuit.
   The bank is the subject of a racketeering investigation by
federal authorities, who on June 21 raided branches in four states,
seizing documents and arresting the officers.
   A federal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York
charges the bank with illegally accepting more than $700 million in
deposits from customers in the United States and sending the money
overseas to avoid taxes.
   ``You had widows investing ... all the money they had to get the
higher interest rates'' offered by the Greek bank, Kangles said.
``There's nothing they can do. There's a deep feeling the money's
not there.''
   Bank officers told customers that interest _ as much as 18
percent a year _ would be paid in Greek drachmas and would not be
subject to U.S. taxes, Kangles said.
   He said about 300 people were party to the lawsuit and that their
ranks could swell to as many as 3,000. He said the $1.5 billion
represented treble damages based on a conservative estimate of about
$500 million in deposits.
   The National Mortgage Bank of Greece is a separate entity from
the National Bank of Greece, which also operates in the United
States. The National Bank of Greece owns about 47 percent of the
mortgage bank, federal authorities say.
   Phone numbers for the mortgage bank's Chicago-based officers were
unlisted, and calls Sunday to the two Chicago-area branches went
unanswered.
   According to court documents, the bank advertised in
Greek-language newspapers, promising that the accounts would be
secret.
   ``They put it in the newspaper,'' Kangles said. ``Almost
everybody believes what they read in the newspaper.''
   The seven branches, in Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and
Pennsylvania, were not even legally authorized to accept money from
customers in the United States, authorities say. Rather, the
branches were opened with the ostensible purpose of encouraging
investment in Greece.
   Kangles said some depositors had gone to Greece to try to get
their money back, and were told accounts were frozen.
   Some of the depositors could face criminal charges if it is shown
they willfully sought to evade taxes, Kangles said. But he said most
of the people did not report the money on their tax returns because
they believed the bank's claims of tax-free status.
   Part of the damage award the depositors are seeking would go to
pay penalties the depositors would owe the Internal Revenue Service,
Kangles said.

<HEAD>Controversial Organizer Meets With Striking Eastern Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maverick labor organizer Ray Rogers met with about
200 striking Eastern Airlines flight attendants Sunday, urging them
to broaden their battle beyond the picket lines and target the
airline's stockholders and other investors.
   ``These workers have tremendous skills that can be put to use,
whether it's canvassing neighborhoods, putting together mailings ...
or speaking to the media,'' Rogers, 45, said after the meeting at a
hotel at Logan International Airport.
   ``They've got to be mobilized, they've got to be transformed into
a powerful economic and political force that can go out and build
economic and political support,'' he said.
   With the strike in its fourth month, the Transport Workers Union
of America hired Rogers last week to try to bring the strike to a
successful end. Rogers said he and the union will hold a Miami news
conference Wednesday to name specific actions they will take in the
next phase of their strike.
   ``Once union leaders realize that everybody can become involved
in a campaign's strategy and tactics, then they can win,'' he said.
   Rogers, who has incurred the wrath of some union leaders for his
maverick style, said his organization, Corporate Campaign Inc., is
working without a fee to help beat Frank Lorenzo, chairman of
Eastern parent Texas Air Corp. and a man considered one of union's
most formidable foes.
   ``This guy is a tough nut to crack,'' Rogers said of the man who
has come out on top in past union struggles with Continental
Airlines, another unit of Texas Air Corp. ``I think we can play an
important role in making this a successful struggle.''
   Rogers said he will contact 65,000 to 90,000 community and union
leaders nationwide and push for their support not only against
Eastern, but also against corporations that are investing in the
carrier.
   Rogers refused to name any specific actions he'd take against
Eastern investors.
   In past strikes, Rogers has caused controversy by forging ahead
in spite of the reservations of union leaders.
   ``Ray has a tremendous talent as an organizer, particularly in a
strike situation, to get members involved and enthusiastic,'' said
Alan Zack, spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers
union. ``Where he has a problem is that he sometimes tends to
substitute his judgment for that of the elected leadership.''
   The flight attendants union hired Rogers because they have faith
in his leadership abilities, said Judith A. Coughlin, the union's
financial secretary.
   ``We've had thousands of people ask us, `What can we do?''' she
said. ``We weren't able to give them the kinds of jobs which we
would like to have given them. Now we can.''
   ``We hired Ray Rogers the organizer, not Ray Rogers the
renegade,'' she said.

<HEAD>INS Says Airline Allows Illegal Aliens To Enter Country</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikebound and financially troubled Eastern
Airlines may face a new problem _ with immigration officials who say
the carrier is doing little to stop illegal aliens from flying into
this country.
   Perry Rivkind, district director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said Eastern has been warned repeatedly to
tighten up checks of aliens taking flights to the United States.
Rivkind said of particular concern has been an increase in Cuban
nationals arriving at Miami International Airport on Eastern flights
from Panama and other Latin countries.
   Forty-seven Cubans were arrrested Saturday for immigration
violations, he said.
   Rivkind said he plans to meet Monday with a federal prosecutor to
discuss possible charges against Eastern and Air Panama. Air Panama
may be linked to a phony passport operation, Rivkind said.
   ``The airlines have got to become much more responsible in that
area,'' Rivkind said Saturday. ``Eastern is very slack on this and
always has been.''
   Eastern spokesman James Ashlock denied the airline was lax in
checking documents. But he said there has been a problem with forged
papers.
   Airlines must check immigration papers before issuing a ticket to
a foreign national to come to the United States.
   ``We do admit, and I think we've explained this to INS, we're
coping with a flood of forged documents, no question about it. It's
an age-old problem in our business,'' Ashlock said.
   ``We will certainly study whatever complaint he plans to bring
up,'' Ashlock added.
   Some Cubans arrested last week told the INS they bought passports
in Panama, used them to board their flight, then gave the passports
to a Panamanian official before takeoff.
   ``Apparently in Panama, it appears that the Panamanian government
is condoning and actually arranging for Cubans to get on flights,''
Rivkind said. ``Possibly both Eastern Airlines and Air Panama staff
may have full knowledge of this.''
   Ashlock said he had heard nothing about passports collected on an
Eastern plane.
   ``I'm going to vigorously pursue this with the attorney
general,'' Rivkind said, saying Eastern's flight crew would had to
have known about the activity.

<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl Ledbetter, former president and
chief executive officer of the Control Data Corp. supercomputer
subsidiary that was closed in April, has left Control Data to form
another company.
   Ledbetter, who headed ETA Systems in St. Paul, said he briefly
explored the possibility of purchasing ETA's assets from Control
Data. But he and former ETA executive Al Moschner decided to start a
new Twin Cities company, he said.
   The new company will make special-purpose, high-performance
computers, Ledbetter said Friday, adding that its product line will
not resemble a general-purpose supercomputer, which was the ETA
product.
   Ledbetter, who presided over Control Data's effort to challenge
Minneapolis-based Cray Research in the world supercomputer market,
was removed from the helm of ETA last October in a restructuring
that folded ETA into the parent company.
   He was reinstated at ETA in February when Control Data reversed
its earlier plan. That prompted speculation that ETA was for sale or
seeking an investor and that Ledbetter was a key ingredient in that
strategy. ETA was closed following losses of more than $100 million
last year.
   While ETA fell victim to its own technological delays and to
Control Data's worsening financial problems, Ledbetter became
well-known in the supercomputer industry and was credited with
having fought an uphill battle to make ETA a competitor.

<HEAD>Group Says Ford Uses Loopholes To Avoid Paying Gas-Guzzler Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. exploited loopholes to avoid paying
$200 million in ``gas guzzler'' taxes during the 1986 model year, a
consumer advocacy group claims.
   Clarence Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety said that Ford
substituted its 1986 Thunderbird for several larger, less
fuel-efficient cars in compiling projections to determine which
models would be subject to the gas-guzzler tax, a special levy
placed on models that fail to meet fuel-efficiency standards.
   ``By slipping this wolf into sheep's clothing, Ford avoided up to
$200 million in gas-guzzler taxes,'' Ditlow wrote in a letter to
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly.
   The EPA said Ford did nothing illegal but appeared to have
violated the spirit of the complex gas-guzzler tax law. Robert
Maxwell, director of the EPA's Certification Division, said he could
not confirm the $200 million figure.
   Ford acknowledged that the EPA questioned its methods for
figuring tax liability but said it had done nothing wrong.
   ``Ford said that, in the future, it would take special care to
avoid this situation,'' said Donald R. Buist, director of the
automaker's Automotive Emissions and Fuel Economy Office.
   In a similar case, Chrysler Corp. was cited in EPA documents for
using loopholes to avoid paying $29 million in gas-guzzler taxes in
the 1988 model year.

   An attorney for unsecured creditors of
Allegheny International Inc. rejected an offer of $700 million for
the troubled small appliance maker.
   The attorney, Robert Sable, said creditors are making significant
progress in negotiating their own plan for reorganizing the company
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy act.
   The bidders, Steinhardt Partners and Japonica Partners of New
York, told stockholders, creditors and lawyers in a letter that they
would use cash, debt and stock to take over the Pittsburgh-based
company. They offered few other details.
   ``It's not something that's going to make a great deal of
difference at this point,'' Sable said Friday. ``There's a lot of
resistance to opening it up to a sale at this point.''
   The company declined to comment.
   Several previous efforts to sell Allegheny International failed.
Among them was a $750 million offer from Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp. The investment banking firm withdrew its
offer after management failed to meet its performance goals.
   Steinhardt said it manages $1.5 billion in financial assets.
Japonica, founded by two former vice presidents of the investment
bank Goldman Sachs, recently offered $1.6 billion for CNW Corp., the
Chicago-based owner of the Chicago &amp; North Western railroad, but
lost out to a higher bid.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Sale of Coleco to Hasbro</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has approved the sale
of financially troubled Coleco Industries Inc.'s major product lines
to the nation's largest toymaker, Hasbro Inc.
   Under the terms of the deal, Hasbro will pay $85 million in cash
for most of Coleco's products, including such widely known toys as
the Cabbage Patch Kids and the Scrabble and Parcheesi board games.
   Approval of the sale Friday signaled the end of the nearly
yearlong bankruptcy case of the Avon, Conn.-based toymaker.
   Judge Prudence B. Abram, who approved the sale, predicted that
the complex case, which has involved a frequently acrimonious battle
between creditors, could be wrapped up by the fall.
   Coleco filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the Federal Bankruptcy Act on July 11, 1988, citing debts of
$540.3 million.
   Barry Alperin, Hasbro's executive vice president, testified
Friday that the Pawtucket, R.I., company wants to complete the
purchase by next week so it can begin advertising and producing the
Coleco products before the Christmas sales season begins.
   Once the sale is completed, most of the remaining 80 employees at
Coleco's headquarters will be laid off in phases as the business is
closed and the court case completed, said J. Brian Clark, Coleco's
president and chief executive officer.
   After the sale, Coleco will retain a few minor toy products, some
real estate and more than $135 million in cash _ the $85 million
from Hasbro plus $50 million in the bank.
   Coleco plans to sell its remaining products and real estate and
reorganize as a new company. Most of the new company's stock will be
owned by Coleco's creditors, with current stockholders owning a
minority interest.
   Coleco's largest creditors, New York businessmen Isaac Perlmutter
and Bernard Marden, will receive a total of $65 million of the cash
gained through the reorganization.
   The payment is $26 million less than the total owed to them, but
the two agreed to the reduced amount to settle a lawsuit filed
against them by the unsecured creditors' committee in the bankruptcy
case.
   The committee's suit charged that Perlmutter and Marden cheated
Coleco out of $71 million through separate business dealings with
the company from 1986 to 1988.
   When Coleco reorganizes, it will have to come up with a new name
because Hasbro is buying the right to use the Coleco name on toys.
   Handel joked during testimony Thursday that executives had
considered but rejected the name ``Toys Were Us.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, again
may be a takeover target, and trading in its shares closed out the
week with plenty of loft.
   UAL was the most active issue traded Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, soaring by $13.50 a share to close at a new high of $166.
   Nearly 1.9 million shares changed hands Friday and the $166
eclipsed the previous 52-week high of $152.50 set the previous day.
   In a court ruling released Friday, U.S. District Judge James B.
Zagel of Chicago sided with the Air Line Pilots Association by
invalidating parts of a UAL contract with the Machinists union.
These provisions gave the Machinists the right to reopen their
contract and strike if the airline were acquired.
   United pilots argued that the provisions amounted to illegal
anti-takeover measures aimed at blocking the $110-per-share bid for
the company they first proposed in 1987.
   ``We have never abandoned our pursuit of the company,'' said Rick
Dubinsky, head of the United pilots unit. ``Those covenants were
impediments to our financing, and now they're apparently out of the
way.''
   Dubinsky said the union is considering a revised bid for the
airline.
   Even before news of the court ruling reached the market, there
was a buying surge earlier Friday, attributed by analysts to
speculation that an offer for UAL might come from its management.
   A UAL spokesman declined to comment on the developments.

<TEXT>
   The explosion of a major pipeline in the Ural
Mountains decreased the country's gas supply by 20 percent, forcing
cuts in gas exports and supplies to domestic factories and
consumers, a government official said.
   Gas Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin also said Soviet consumers
should conserve gas used in kitchen stoves and brace for shortages
of rubber and plastic goods made from the petroleum products the
pipeline carried.
   A 1,153-mile pipeline carrying a mixture of benzine, propane and
butane from western Siberia to chemical factories and kitchen stoves
in the country's center burst June 4 as two passenger trains were
passing.
   A spark from the Trans-Siberian Railroad trains touched off an
explosion and fire, incinerating more than 600 passengers 745 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said workers noticed a drop in
pressure caused by the leak but increased the flow instead of
shutting the line down.
   On the day of the accident, a Gas Ministry spokesman told The
Associated Press the gas flow from the region was quickly diverted
to an alternate pipeline and that no significant disruption
occurred. It was not immediately possible to explain the discrepency
in the two official's assessments.
   Chernomyrdin told the government daily Izvestia, in an interview
published Saturday, that the pipeline carried 13,500 tons of the
17,000 tons of liquefied gas that western Siberia supplies daily to
the country's center. He said the accident caused a daily production
shortfall of 5,000 tons.
   Izvestia did not say how many tons of gas the nation produces,
but it said the accident caused a 20 percent reduction in gas
supplies in June.
   Chernomyrdin said many petrochemical factories are either idle or
working at half strength because of the gas shortfall. He also said
raw petroleum products supplied to industry will be cut by 25
percent in the third quarter of the year, causing losses in the
millions of rubles.
   The gas shortage and decreased plastic and rubber supplies will
affect Soviet consumers already grappling with shortages of meat,
butter, toothpaste, sugar and matches. Chernomyrdin said gas
supplies to the 41 million stoves in the Soviet Union will be cut 6
percent in the third quarter.
   The minister urged people to conserve gas in their homes and use
alternate fuels in country houses.
   The disruption also is hurting the nation's attempts to obtain
foreign currency badly needed in Gorbachev's drive to modernize
domestic industry.
   The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil and gas producer.
   Chernomyrdin said the loss of the pipeline would force a 60
percent reduction in gas exports in the third quarter, depriving the
country of $12.5 million in foreign currency income.
   Because it won't be able to fulfill some contracts with foreign
customers, the Soviets will have to pay $1.6 million in fines and
spend $31.2 million in foreign currency on repair equipment. In all,
he said, repairs will take half a year and cost more than $156
million.
   Natural and man-made disasters have hampered the Gorbachev
administration.
   The nation spent millions to clean up and rebuild after the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident and the December 1988
earthquake in Armenia.
