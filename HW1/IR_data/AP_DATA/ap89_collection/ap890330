   Francis Patrelle is a choreographer who uses
classical and neoclassical ballet to create characters in dance. He
also has enough inventiveness to remain interesting and not keep
repeating himself, without getting ``way out.''
   Dances Patrelle, formed a year ago, is holding its first,
one-week season at Florence Gould Hall in the French Institute.
Most of the dancers are guests from established companies. The idea
of the company is to show Patrelle's choreography as effectively as
possible.
   On Wednesday, the second night, the program began with ``Adieu,
with a Handshake,'' with Peter Boal of the New York City Ballet as
Vincent van Gogh, James Jordan as his brother Theo, who tried
unsuccessfully to sell his paintings, and Jana Fugate as Theo's
wife. They danced to a Debussy recording.
   Boal's part became increasingly searching, reaching, extending,
anxious. The other two responded sometimes affectionately,
sometimes coldly to his thrusts into their midst. We like that
ballet best.
   Two pleasing pas de deux followed. Judith Fugate of the New York
City Ballet and Medhi Bahiri danced ``Fantasy Pas de Deux'' from
``Beloved-Memories.'' Patrelle choreographed that for ``Cynthia
Gregory and Fernando Bujones Together'' performances at the City
Center last September.
   Patrelle, who was born in Bucks County, Pa., was resident
choreographer for the Berkshire Ballet from 1974 to '84 and created
a full-length ``Romeo and Juliet'' there. Jana Fugate and Jordan
danced the ``Balcony Scene.'' It was full of romance but didn't
build. Instead of meeting shyly and falling more and more in love,
the dancers met with familiarity.
   The final dance, ``Come Rain-Come Shine,'' is 55 minutes long
and was new in 1986, when it starred Merrill Ashley of the New York
City Ballet. This season, it stars Cynthia Gregory of American
Ballet Theater. She brings the strength of assurance to it. When
she and her partner, Donald Williams of the Dance Theater of
Harlem, are dancing, one is enthralled.
   The music is recordings by Judy Garland. The concept, however,
seems forced onto the songs. The stage is a boxing ring hwere three
couples do ``marital-battle dances.''
   We particularly tired of Judith Fugate and Medhi Bahiri's
characterizations. He's an unfaithful lover and she's always
pleading to get him back. When he decides to grant her the favor,
she always turns aside. Cynthia ry and Donald Williams have
nearly as much non-motivated top-and-for togetherness and anger.
Louise Nadeau ando Merlo dance a couple who get along better.
Thesh and has lots of dance sequences to relish but
the idea ofte't fit the lyrics.

<HEAD>West Bank Arabs Barred from Cleaning Tel Aviv Streets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinians from the occupied territories will
no longer be allowed to clean the streets of Tel Aviv, and Jews
will be encouraged to take their place, city officials say.
   ``The Arabs from the territories can't be depended on to get to
work,'' Meir Doron, the municipality's deputy director-general,
said Wednesday.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began nearly 16 months ago, army
curfews on Arab villages and threats by uprising leaders warning
the workers to stay away from jobs in Israel have kept many from
getting to work.
   About 100,000 Palestinians work in Israel, mostly in menial
labor, construction and hotel maintenance.
   Most of the 300 street sweepers Tel Aviv hires on a daily basis
have been Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Many days only a dozen or so would arrive,'' municipality
spokesman Benny Cohen said. ``One day only four showed up for
work.''
   But city officials say they may have trouble finding Israelis
who want to sweep streets although they are prepared to pay Jews
more than the Arabs received.
   ``The problem is that people don't want to take this kind of job
because of the stigma once associated with it,'' Doron said.
``People think that cleaning houses or sweeping streets is a job
for laborers brought in from Africa, or Arabs.''

<HEAD>Preliminary Inspections Show No Problems With B-1B Bomber</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Air Force found no
problems in inspections Wednesday of at least 19 B-1B bombers,
which were grounded two days earlier after one of the plane's swing
wings punctured a fuel tank, a spokesman said.
   Col. Larry Greer of the Strategic Air Command said six more of
the older B-1B's would be inspected before the Air Force decided
whether to clear them for flight. The inspections were to be
completed at Offut Air Force Base by early Thursday, Greer said.
   SAC has 97 B-1Bs, which are up to 2{ years old.
   The 25 picked for inspection were representative of older B-1B's
at SAC's four B-1 wings, Greer said. Most are stationed at Dyess
Air Force Base in Texas, McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas, Grand
Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota and Ellsworth Air Force Base
in South Dakota.
   Other planes are stationed at a maintenance depot at Tinker Air
Force Base in Oklahoma and a contractors plant in Palmdale, Calif.,
the colonel said.
   Gen. John T. Chain Jr., SAC's commander, will review inspection
reports and make a final decision on whether the bombers should be
returned to service, Greer said.
   The fuel tank damaged during a routine pre-flight check at Dyess
was apparently punctured when the mechanism that sweeps the
bomber's wings back and forth malfunctioned, Pentagon spokesman Dan
Howard said Tuesday.
   ``We are looking at something called the wing-sweeper gear
sub-assembly,'' Greer said Wednesday. ``That's the gear box inside
the swing wings which gives it power to sweep the wings up and
back. You can sweep them back for a sort of delta shape to fly
close to supersonic speeds and you sweep them out for landing and
takeoff.''
   Howard said the Texas bomber's crew was sweeping the wings
forward and backward before taking off and discovered the wings
were not moving evenly together.

<HEAD>Consumers Union: Chemical in Products Claiming Otherwise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNT VERNON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers Union reported Wednesday
that it found the controversial additive Alar in nearly
three-fourths of the apple juice samples it tested, and said five
of them had unacceptably high levels.
   The report came on the same day an industry group, the Processed
Apple Institute, said in Washington, D.C., that it tested 4,623
samples of juice and apple sauce and found only eight with
detectable levels.
   Consumers Union, which published Consumer Reports, said
virtually all the juices containing Alar came from processors who
had pledged not to use Alar-treated apples. It also found the
chemical in 11 of 20 raw apples purchased in the New York City area.
   The government has estimated that only 5 percent to 10 percent
of apples are sprayed with Alar, the trade name for daminozide. It
is used to help keep apples on the tree until they are ripe and
keep them firm and red after harvest.
   The chemical got attention recently when a private environmental
group released a report saying children were at increased risk of
cancer from eating apples and apple products containing Alar.
   Several cities, including New York and Los Angeles, banned
apples from school cafeterias. Some later resumed serving apples.
   The EPA announced last month that it will soon propose a ban on
daminozide, which would probably take effect in late 1990.
   At question is what level of the chemical is acceptable. The
federal Environmental Protection Agency's limit is 20 parts per
million.
   The five juices declared unacceptable in the May issue of
Consumer Reports had levels ranging from 0.62 parts per million to
1.80 parts per million. The industry group said a detectable level
meant a trace of at least 1 part per million, or 20 times below the
EPA limit.
   Consumers Union tested 44 adult apple juices bought in 1988 and
1989, as well as seven baby-food apple juices.
   The brand rated unacceptable by CU and their Alar concentrations
were Hudson Pride (1.80 ppm), Waldbaum's (1.08), Pathmark (0.72)
and Pathmark Natural Style (0.91), all from the New York region,
and Lady Lee (0.62), sold in Lucky Stores in the West.
   All five were rated unacceptable by the magazine ``not because
drinking them is likely to cause cancer, but because many other
products are far less likely to contain high Alar levels.''
   Responding to CU's report, the Processed Apple Institute said,
``We are pleased that their results so closely mirror our own.''
   Spokesmen for Waldbaum's and Pathmark said they had taken the
products in question off the shelves. They said the stores had been
assured through legal documents that suppliers didn't use products
made from Alar-treated apples.
   Robert Wunderle, spokesman for Supermarkets General Corp.,
parent company of Pathmark, said the company had required apple
juice suppliers since 1986 to certify they weren't made from
Alar-treated apples.
   ``Are we splitting hairs here or are we dealing with something
of substance?'' he said of Consumer Reports' cutoff level for
deeming a product unacceptable.
   ``We have been doing spot testing, so this came as a surprise to
us,'' said Mike Rourke, spokesman for A&amp;P, the parent company of
Waldbaum's. He said the batch tested by Consumers Union had been
traced and taken off shelves.
   Dr. Edward Groth III, associate technical director at Consumers
Union, said, ``Our results show that the industry's voluntary
boycott of Alar isn't working.''
   Consumers Union said it found six brands with very low or
undetectable levels for both years: Martinelli's Gold Medal, Minute
Maid, Musselman's, Red Cheek, Speas Farm and Mott's Natural Style.
   Another seven tested in 1989 showed similarly low levels,
Consumers Union said: Key Food, Lincoln, Lincoln Natural Style,
Lucky Leaf, Veryfine 100 McIntosh, Finast and a generic brand
bought at a Finast store.
   The baby-food apple juices had very low levels, CU said, with
Beech-Nut and Gerber products having no detectable residues.

<HEAD>Perez Says Brady Plan `Excellent Basis' To Begin Tackling Debt Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN S. CARLSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez said
Wednesday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's new plan to
tackle Latin America's debt crisis offers hope for the region's
troubled democracies.
   Perez said the Brady plan dovetails with proposals developed by
Latin American finance ministers and that together the two plans
provide ``an excellent basis for dialogue and a meeting of minds.''
   Perez, who spoke in Spanish through an interpreter, made his
comments on the first day of The Hemispheric Agenda, a two-day
conference at the Carter Center co-chaired by former presidents
Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, Argentine President Raul
Alfonsin, Uruguayan President Julio Sanguinetti and other U.S. and
foreign officials are scheduled to speak Thursday.
   The conference is aimed at coming up with ideas on key
hemispheric issues, particularly the debt problem.
   Perez said the Latin American democracies' $400 billion debt
places ``unsustainable pressures'' on local economies.
   He said both the Brady and finance ministers' plans involve ``a
reduction in the amount of the debt, extended repayment periods and
an increase in the capital flows needed'' to help financially
strapped countries get on the road to recovery.
   Recent public disturbances in Venezuela illustrate the urgency
of the change in the debt repayment plan, he said.
   While the governments of Latin America have proven their
willingness to adopt ``disciplined administration ... to prevent
funds being misused,'' Perez said the creditor countries must
acknowledge Latin America's need for a continuing influx of
investment capital.
   Under the current debt structure, Perez said, ``We are being
drained of our resources by having to make debt payments with the
meager funds of austerity policies that irremediably affect our
peoples' behavior, to the dramatic extent shown recently in
Venezuela.''
   At least 247 people were killed and scores injured during riots
two weeks ago in Caracas following an austerity program that
brought steep increases in bus fares, gasoline and other goods and
services.
   ``The unsustainable pressures of the economic crisis on our
democracies ... decapitalize all our countries, slash our per
capita income and drastically wipe out the investment necessary to
restore economic growth,'' Perez said.
   The Venezuelan president said solving chronic economic problems
is critical for the survival of the Latin American democracies.
   ``Time is running out for Latin America. The debt is already
eroding our democracies' assets,'' Perez said. ``The solution lies
in making traditional markets dynamic again. But as long as Latin
America is in a state of economic gloom, this option will be
non-existent.''

   Sigourney Weaver, nominated for both lead and
supporting actress awards, became the first such dual nominee in
Oscar history not to win in either category.
   She received a best actress nomination for her portrayal of
famed primate researcher Dian Fossey in ``Gorillas in the Mist.''
It was Miss Weaver's second nomination in this category, with her
role in 1986's ``Aliens'' the first.
   Miss Weaver also was nominated for her supporting performance as
the no holds-barred Wall Street boss in ``Working Girl,'' a
character she described as a ``tycoon-sharkess.''
   The four performers before her who were nominated in both
leading and supporting categories include Jessica Lange, who in
1982 was nominated for the lead in ``Frances'' and won for her
supporting part in ``Tootsie.''
   Others were Barry Fitzgerald, who in 1944 played the lead in
``Going My Way'' but won for the supporting role in the same film;
Teresa Wright, nominated for the lead in 1942's ``The Pride of the
Yankees'' and won for her supporting role in ``Mrs. Miniver,'' and
Fay Bainter, who was nominated for the lead in 1938's ``White
Banners'' and won for her supporting role in ``Jezebel.''

   Despite official predictions that oil from the
largest U.S. spill ever will not reach Canadian waters, the
spreading Alaskan slick is causing growing concern about Arctic
development and tanker shipping.
   ``I think it's so massive that we just don't know what we're
going to do with it at this time,'' Arne Hansen of the Western
Canada Wilderness Committee said Wednesday by telephone from
Vancouver, British Columbia.
   He said the the environmental group long has been worried about
supertankers in the Pacific lanes off of Canada.
   ``We had been expecting a spill like this for years,'' Hansen
said. ``It's like a meltdown of a nuclear reactor.''
   The spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound has been a leading
news story in Canada since the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on
Friday.
   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard told reporters Tuesday at a
meeting in Meech Lake, Quebec, that it might be a good idea to
review the Canada-U.S. agreement on West Coast oil shipping.
   ``We are concerned about what happened because we know that
these kind of disasters can happen everywhere,'' he said. ``So we
will see what we can do for the future.''
   Bouchard and his aides have said repeatedly that it is unlikely
the oil spill off Valdez, Alaska, will directly affect Canadian
waters or shores.
   When asked about the U.S. plan to allow some oil and gas
drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge bordering Canada, Bouchard
said the Arctic ``is an extremely fragile area.''
   ``We are extremely worried, we are opposed to this,'' he said.
   The Canadian government has said it opposes the plan for the
Alaskan development next to its Yukon territory because it could
disrupt the migratory patterns of the porcupine caribou herd.
   James Fulton, environment critic for the socialist New
Democratic Party, predicted in a telephone interview from Ottawa
that some oil from the Valdez spill eventually will affect Canadian
territory even if the prevailing currents move the bulk of it north.
   ``I've looked at all of the most recent tidal and current
charts,'' he said. ``I don't think there's much doubt that some of
the spill is likely to reach Canadian territory.''
   Fulton represents in Parliament British Columbia's Skeena
district, which includes the province's northwestern Pacific coast.
   He said the difficulties in the cleanup show that the oil
industry's ``state of prepardeness is very close to zero.''
   Calls to his office have been running 9-to-1 in favor of action
such as a halt to tanker traffic, Fulton said.
   ``People are mad,'' he said. ``People are getting really sick
and tired of being kicked around by large corporations.''

   Folk singer Arlo Guthrie plans his first
concert in Woody Guthrie's hometown in conjunction with the release
of an album of his late father's songs.
   The album was recorded Dec. 1 by schoolchildren at the
refurbished Crystal Theatre in Okemah. It features songs written by
his father and by children from Okemah, Langston and Davenport.
   Carolyn Price, chairwoman of the WOODY Educational Fund, said
Wednesday the April 29 concert will be the focus of the community's
Pioneer Day activities. The acronym stands for Woody Guthrie Okemah
Organization for Developing Youngsters.
   Woody Guthrie has been criticized in his hometown for leftist
positions he had taken in the 1930s and 1940s. Ms. Price said she
believes the community is willing to accept him now, 22 years after
his death.
   ``We feel like the door is opening now,'' she said.
   She said Guthrie's remaining critics in Okemah are a small
minority.
   ``Just because they're vocal doesn't mean they're right,'' she
said.

   The Black Orchid, an upscale restaurant partly
owned by actor Tom Selleck, was fined $35,400 for 173 immigration
law violations, federal officials said.
   In order to prevent illegal aliens from obtaining employment,
all employers must verify that new employees are U.S. citizens or
aliens who have the right to work in the United States.
   ``It is unfortunate that this employer did not comply with the
law,'' the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Harold Ezell
said Wednesday.
   ``We're just shocked to hear it,'' said Randy Schoch, president
and part-owner of the restaurant. ``We have no illegal aliens
working for us, absolute zero. We felt that we had filled out all
the forms.''
   INS officials told reporters Wednesday that illegal aliens were
found working at the restuarant. The agency said it could not give
an exact count.
   The INS checked more than 300 Black Orchid employee immigration
compliance forms and found only 32 were correctly filled out, Ezell
said.

   Olympic gold medalist Greg Louganis'
housemate and former business manager has been ordered to stay at
least 500 feet away from the diver unless they mutually agree to
closer contact.
   But Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs on Tuesday refused to
order R. James Babbitt out of the Malibu home he has shared with
Louganis the past four years.
   Louganis, who won gold medals for springboard and platform
diving in last summer's Olympics, fired Babbitt, his manager for
six years, on March 13. He alleges that Babbitt threatened to make
public ``confidential and private facts'' about him unless Louganis
rehires him or compensates him.
   The 29-year-old Louganis said Babbitt had threatened to destroy
his personal belongings and to shoot him if he tried to enter the
house.
   In a sworn declaration, Babbitt said he has never harassed
Louganis.
   Although Janavs ordered Babbitt to stay away from Louganis, he
allowed him to withdraw $5,000 in living expenses from their joint
account in addition to continue living at the home. Louganis said
he is the sole owner of the house, but Babbitt contended he is a
co-owner.
   Janavs' order came in the form of a temporary restraining order.
He scheduled a hearing April 12 to determine whether to issue a
preliminary injunction against Babbitt.

<HEAD>Report Says Doctors Should Help Dying Experience ``Good Death''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors should ease the dying of their hopelessly
ill patients by giving them as much pain medicine as they need and
even helping them commit suicide, if they wish, a report today
concludes.
   The report, drawn up by a panel of prominent physicians,
contends that doctors have an obligation to help terminally ill
patients have ``a good death,'' just as they help them lead a
healthy life.
   ``We really think that the physician has a responsibility to be
actively involved in creating an environment in which a peaceful
death can occur,'' said Dr. Sidney H. Wanzer, principal author of
the report.
   The most controversial of the group's conclusions was that ``it
is not immoral for a physician to assist in the rational suicide of
a terminally ill patient.''
   Wanzer said doctors can ethically prescribe sleeping pills or
other drugs to dying patients, knowing they will use them for
suicide, and even tell them how big a dose is lethal.
   The doctors said such assistance is ``certainly not rare.''
However, they added that if physicians tend to their dying
patients' comfort and dignity, suicide requests should be
infrequent.
   Two doctors on the 12-member committee disagreed with the
suicide guideline.
   ``I don't want a blanket statement to say it is not immoral. I
can accept that someone else may say it is moral, but I want to be
able to say I don't like this,'' said one of the dissenters, Dr.
Jan van Eys of the University of Texas System Cancer Center in
Houston.
   The report is the second from the committee, which was chaired
by Dr. Daniel D. Federman of Harvard Medical School, former
president of the American College of Physicians. It was published
in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Its first report, issued five years ago, also dealt with the
ethics of obeying patients' final wishes, including removing
feeding tubes. Some of its recommendations have since been widely
adopted by doctors and courts.
   The doctors noted that one of the greatest concerns of the dying
and their families is that doctors won't give enough painkillers.
They said this fear is largely justified.
   The group said that allowing a patient to experience unbearable
pain or suffering is unethical medical practice. When death becomes
inevitable, the importance of relieving pain outweighs the risk of
hastening death.
   ``It is morally correct to increase the dose of narcotics to
whatever dose is needed, even though the medication may contribute
to the depression of respiration or blood pressure, the dulling of
consciousness, or even death, provided the primary goal of the
physician is to relieve suffering,rote. ``The proper dose
of pain medication is the dose that is sufficient to relieve pain
and suffering, even to the point of unconsciousness.anel recommended that
doctors qupatients about
whether they want aggressive treatment to prolong the dying
proess. Their values and wishes shoart of their medical
records, aursing homes should regularly rents'
preferences.
   Besides Harvard and the University of Texas, panel membewere
from Pritzcine in Chicago, Massachusetts General
Hospitalounty Medical Center in Minneapolis, the
Univeria Medical Center, the University of California
School of Medicine in San Francco, the Mayo Clinic and the
Unif Pittsburgh Medical School.

   ``Rain Man,'' the story of a conniving car
salesman who learns to love his autistic brother, won the Oscar as
best picture Wednesday night and brought top honors to actor Dustin
Hoffman and director Barry Levinson. Jodie Foster, the victim of a
gang rape in ``The Accused,'' was named best actress of 1988.
   ``Rain Man'' also captured a prize for the original screenplay
Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow, bringing its total to four Oscars at
the 61st Academy Awards. Tying with three each were ``Dangerous
Liaisons,'' the ornate drama of drawing room seduction in
pre-Revolutionary France, and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' the
brilliant combination of live action and animation.
   Geena Davis, the free-spirited dog trainer in ``The Accidental
Tourist'' and Kevin Kline, the wild-eyed, oversexed safecracker in
``A Fish Called Wanda,'' were surprise winners in supporting roles.
   ``This is such a big deal!'' said Miss Foster, a former child
star who won her first Oscar.
   ``Cruelty might be human and it might be cultural, but it's not
acceptable, and that's what this movie is about,'' she said.
   ``I'm supposed to be jaded by this time, but I'm not,'' said
Hoffman, who also won the award for ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' in 1979.
He embraced loser Gene Hackman while on his way to the stage, where
he basked in a standing ovation in tribute to his meticulously
researched portrayal of an autistic savant.
   ``We tried to be as faithful as we could and be entertaining,''
said Levinson of the low-key ``Rain Man,'' which also starred Tom
Cruise as Hoffman's brother and has grossed $134.6 million at the
box office.
   ``This is really about two actors _ Dustin Hoffman and Tom
Cruise,'' Levinson said. ``If they didn't deliver the performanaces
they gave, I wouldn't be up here this evening.''
   ``First of all, I want to thank Anne Tyler for writing such a
wonderful book,'' Miss Davis said in accepting the first prize of
the night at the 61st Academy Awards. She has said she read Miss
Tyler's novel when it was first published and coveted the role of
Muriel.
   The award to Miss Davis drew yelps of approval from the audience
of 6,500 in the Shrine Auditorium, possibly because the favorites
appeared to have been Frances McDormand for ``Mississippi Burning''
and Sigourney Weaver for ``Working Girl.''
   ``This is astonishing,'' said Kline, who also had not been
considered a front-runner.
   ``Liaisons'' won Oscars for Christopher Hampton's adaptation of
his play and for art direction and costume design. ``Roger Rabbit''
won for film editing, sound effects and visual effects.
   ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' won for best score and
``Mississippi Burning'' for cinematography.``Bird'' won the Oscar
for best sound, and ``Beetlejuice'' for makeup.
   Named best song of the year was Carly Simon's ``Let the River
Run'' from ``Working Girl.'' The academy could find only three
songs to nominate this year instead of the usual five, and didn't
see fit to have them performed during the show.
   The year's best foreign language film was Denmark's ``Pelle the
Conqueror'' a grim tale about an exploited farmworker and his son.
   With Wednesday's ceremonies, the Academy dropped the traditional
line ``The winner is ...'' in favor of ``And the Oscar goes to
...'' The intent was to soften the sense of competition, but
several presenters, including Cher for best picture, reverted to
the old line.
   More than 1,500 early bird fans, many with sleeping bags and
food, had packed bleachers facing the four 24-foot Oscars that
guard the Moorish arches at the entrance to the auditorium.
   Hollywood's annual tribute to itself, televised live on ABC,
moved at its usual plodding place and was burdened with
heavy-handed production numbers. The industry relied heavily on
nostalgia, recruiting as presenters such old-time partners as James
Stewart and Kim Novak and Bob Hope and Lucille Ball.
   The 1989 season followed a record year at the box office. More
than 1 billion tickets were sold in 1988, with gross revenues of
$4.38 billion.

   Producer Allan Carr promised an infusion of glamor for the
awards show, whose Nielsen ratings have declined steeply over the
years.
   But the telecast opened with an embarrassing production number
that included a Snow White character who talked like Betty Boop and
accompanied actor Rob Lowe in a rendition of the rock song ``Proud
Mary'' amid dancing nightclub tables.
   Security was much in evidence as the time approached for the
ceremonies. One hundred Los Angeles police were on special
assignment at the event, augmenting the private security guards who
had been at the Shrine for five days. Said one of them: ``A lot of
people want in on the action, and we have to see that they don't
get it.''
   Last year traffic planning was a fiasco, forcing many
participants to leave their limos and walk blocks to the
auditorium. This year 75 officers from the State Department of
Transportation were assigned to the area, a couple of miles south
of downtown by the University of Southern California campus.
   Nominations for acting, directing, art direction and specialized
categories are handled by select branches and committees of Academy
members.
   All voting members of the Academy can participate in the best
picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all
categories. Winners for best documentary feature, best animated
short film and best live-action short film are chosen by only those
members who have seen all the nominees.

   America's best-known brothel is on the verge
of becoming publicly owned, but for the Mustang Ranch's working
women, bedroom business still interests them more than any Wall
Street transaction.
   ``Basically, we don't keep up with all that,'' said 21-year-old
Gina, a prostitute at the ranch for the past three years.
   The six-week bid to make the ranch the nation's first publicly
held bordello through a $23.3 million stock offering at $20 a share
is about 80 percent sold, and the offering should close in about a
week, said the president of the firm handling the sale.
   Eric Walloga, whose Tampa, Fla.-based American Wallstreet
Securities Inc. is overseeing the offering, said he expected the
issue to sell out once Nevada joins the nine other states and the
District of Columbia where the stock is being offered.
   Judith Allan, education and research coordinator for the Nevada
Securities Division in Las Vegas, said a decision on the stock was
expected by Monday.
   ``I feel that with Nevada coming in, we'd be able to close in a
few days,'' Walloga said.
   At the Mustang Ranch, the impending sale means more than a new
boss for 23-year-old Peaches. It means losing the friendship of
owner Joe Conforte.
   ``I love him as a boss,'' she said. ``If you have problems, you
can go and talk to him like a friend.''
   For Conforte, 63, the sale will not only free him from the
burdens and occasional legal hassles of running the brothel 10
miles east of Reno. It will finally let him pay off the
longstanding tax debt that led to an 18-month imprisonment.
   Conforte and his wife, Sally, have been trying to sell the
105-room brothel and the 440 acres of land on which it's located
since Conforte was released from prison in early 1985.
   The Confortes, who opened the ranch in the early 1950s, will
receive $13 million for the brothel and the property plus $5
million for agreeing not to open a competing bordello.
   The prostitutes rent their rooms for $10 a day and keep half
their earnings, which start at about $80 for a half-hour, paid by
cash or credit card in advance.
   Prostitution is allowed in 11 of Nevada's 14 rural counties, but
is forbidden in the counties where Reno, Las Vegas and Carson City
are located.
   Since the offering was approved by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in mid-February, the stock had been approved for sale in
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland, New York,
Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii and the District of Columbia.
   Once the offering is sold out, the brothel can officially change
hands and the stock will be traded over the counter, Walloga said.
The stock is being offered by Mustang Ranch Inc., an investors'
group composed primarily of Reno businessmen and attorneys.
   A 1985 effort to turn the brothel public fell through.
   The prospectus distributed by American Wallstreet lists gross
revenues for the brothel of $5.6 million in 1986, down from $5.9
million the year before, but a 1986 profit of $917,000 compared
with $848,000 in 1985.
   It also warns potential investors of possible risks, lawsuits,
adverse publicity and the possibility that customers could contract
sexually transmitted diseases.

<TEXT>
   Seven people, including a sitting member of the
Bahamian parliament and a highly visible Boston defense attorney,
have been indicted on charges they schemed to launder illegal drug
profits, the government announced Wednesday.
   The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury a week ago and
unsealed Wednesday, centers around the activities of reputed drug
mogul Salvatore M. Caruana, according to acting U.S. Attorney
Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan.
   It charges that Caruana made $7.5 million selling marijuana,
then conspired with the other six defendants to invest and launder
the money using ``front'' companies in the Bahamas, Panama and the
United States.
   Caruana He is charged with racketeering and, along with the
other six defendants, conspiring to defraud the IRS.
   The others include Kendal W. Nottage, a member of the Bahamian
Parliament and a former cabinet minister to Bahamian Prime Minister
Lynden Pindling, and prominent Boston attorney Joseph J. Balliro.
   Caruana has been a fugitive on the government's most wanted list
since 1984, when he jumped bail after being indicted for allegedly
smuggling $173 million of mariujana into New England.
   Nottage, 48, who is an attorney, was charged with conspiring to
defraud the U.S. government.
   The indictment accuses Nottage of transporting large sums of
money to the Bahamas for Caruana and executing a false document
that concealed Caruana's interest in the island's Islander Hotel,
which was used to launder the money.
   Nottage's wife, Rubie, 45, also an attorney in Nassau, was one
of four people charged with conspiring to violate federal
racketeering laws.
   Both Nottages are accused of lying about Caruana and their
activities on his behalf to a special commission appointed by the
Bahamian government to investigate drug trafficking there.
   The couple released a statement Wednesday maintaining their
innocence. They said Kendal Nottage simply negotiated a loan to pay
off a mortgage on the hotel he had owned and occupied since 1976,
before he became a cabinet minister. No money was sent to the
Bahamas because the lenders and mortgage holders were in the Boston
area and the loan was arranged by attorneys who did not disclose
the lender's identity, the statement said.
   ``To our knowledge, neither Kendal nor I have broken any law in
the United States or at home here in the Bahamas,'' the statement
said.
   The Nottages have previously stated their innocence and called
the indictment, which has been expected, a political move by the
United States to smear the Bahamas as a drug laundering center.
   A Bahamian with close ties to Pindling was one of 30 people
indicted last week by a federal grand jury in Jacksonville, Fla.,
for allegedly taking bribes to allow Columbia's Medellin Cartel to
use the Bahamas as a way station for drug shipments.
   O'Sullivan said the two cases were unconnected.
   He said the Caruana case also was unrelated to indictments
announced in Washington in what federal officials called
``Operation Polar Cap,'' a crackdown on an alleged billion-dollar
international drug laundering operation.
   The Boston indictment accuses Balliro, 61, and another Boston
attorney, Edmund M. Hurley, 54, of Brookline, of racketeering and
income tax violations.
   Balliro has represented a convicted Mafia defendant on
conspiracy to defraud the IRS. Hurley has represented Caruana on
civil matters.
   Last week, Balliro held a news conference to deny any wrongdoing
and called the charges a personal attack by O'Sullivan. Balliro
demanded a special prosecutor be appointed in the case.
   O'Sullivan called Balliro's claim that the charges resulted from
personal animosity between himself and the lawyer ``a figment of
Mr. Balliro's imagination.''
   The interim U.S. attorney, who will step down from his post
Friday, said he took the unusual step of having the entire two-year
investigation and the indictments reviewed by two independent
sections of the Justice Department.
   O'Sullivan said his superiors found no need to appoint a special
prosecutor.
   Also indicted were David T. Gorwitz, 58, also a fugitive, and
Charles R. Burnett, age 47, a Pompano Beach, Fla., attorney.
   O'Sullivan said the State Department had received help from the
Bahamian Commission of Inquiry, had notified the Bahamian
government of the indictments and would ask that the Nottages be
extradited.
   But in a statement released Wednesday evening, the Bahamian
government said the United States had not supplied any evidence
that couple had violated any laws or provided any details of the
indictment.
   The statement called the indictment an ``attempt to extend
United States' legal jurisdiction beyond its shores into the
sovereign territory of an independent nation.''
   The Bahamian government also questioned the timi of the
indictment, which comesth before Congress is to consider
certifying the Bahamas as a cooperating country in the fight
against drug trafficking.

<HEAD>New License Would Save Money for Sport Pilots</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   People who want to learn to fly can save as
much as $1,850 by qualifying for a new recreational pilot license.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced requirements for
the new license Wednesday, saying it was designed for would-be
recreational or sport pilots who are willing to fly short distances
in daylight at low altitudes within 50 miles of the airport where
they train.
   The new recreational certification for flying basic aircraft,
including home-built and experimental models, will require less
training or experience than a private pilot certificate.
   The FAA estimates that the new rules will save a would-be pilot
between $1,200 and $1,850 from what it would take to get a private
pilot license. The cost of training for a full private license is
estimated at between $3,100 and $4,750, depending on hourly fees
charged, said spokesman John Leyden.
   Pilots who get the new license will not have to learn how to use
sophisticated navigational or radio equipment, which is required of
other private pilots, the FAA said in a news release. But they
cannot fly in areas which require communication with air traffic
controllers.
   The FAA said the sport pilot's training will focus on basic
flying skills.
   The new rule limits recreational pilots to single-engine
aircraft with no more than 180 horsepower engines, a fixed landing
gear and no more than four seats. They will be allowed to carry
only one passenger and cannot fly for hire.
   At the same time, the agency imposed new testing requon
student pilots and new annual reviews for inexperienced pilots who
are not rated to fly with instruments.
   The FAA also increased the flight visibility requirement fortudent
pilots from one mile to three miles and r they
pass a written test before their first solo flight.

<HEAD>White House Extolling Virtues of Random Drug-Testing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's chief spokesman is touting
random drug-testing for federal employees and says he thinks it is
shortsighted for White House workers to resist it.
   Commenting Wednesday on a longstanding suit against the testing
by some 30 employees of the Executive Office of the President,
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater called drug abuse ``an insidious
problem'' in America.
   ``It's everywhere. It's throughout our society,'' the spokesman
said. ``And all of our institutions should be taking a look at ways
to curb it. And that's what the federal government's doing.''
   Fitzwater defended the government's right to subject employees
to random drug-testing as the Secret Service disclosed that four
officers accused of drug abuse had been removed from its payroll.
   Spokesman Bob Snow said there had been two resignations and two
firings in the Uniformed Division of the agency, which guards
foreign embassies and the White House grounds. The departure of the
four guards stemmed from an investigation that surfaced last May.
   A source who declined to be named publicly said U.S. Attorney
Jay Stephens' office decided that there should be no prosecution
for the alleged drug use, which was said to involve cocaine. But it
could not immediately be learned whether the two resignations and
the two firings resulted from negotiations with Stephens' office.
   ``From our standpoint, they're gone,'' Snow said. He said the
more than 950 officers in the Uniformed Division are now subjected
to routine drug testing.
   Fitzwater noted that the suit initially was filed in federal
court here against then-President Reagan and that Reagan's name was
replaced with Bush's when the administrations changed Jan. 20.
   The Reagan White House, chafing over revelations of drug abuse
by presidential employees in sensitive jobs, announced June 30 that
everyone on its payroll would be subject to random drug tests in 60
days. But that program has been held up by court challenges.
   The employees say false test results could make them subject to
undeserved penalties.
   Reagan's announcement had been preceded by revelations that two
National Security Council clerks resigned and three Secret Service
officers were suspended while awaiting the outcome of an
investigation into alleged drug use.
   Neither the White House nor the Secret Service would describe at
the time what drugs were involved in the investigation, which led
to the resignations of the two NSC clerks and placement of three
Uniformed Division officers on administrative leave.
   During a speech last week to several Delaware groups involved in
combating drug use, Bush hailed two Supreme Court rulings upholding
mandatory workplace drug testing for people in law enforcement and
public safety jobs.
   ``I hope this will help achieve our goal of a drug-free
workplace,'' he said.
   Neither of the two Supreme Court opinions dealt head-on with the
constitutionality of random drug testing for some 400,000 federal
workers.
   On Wednesday, Fitzwater was asked what Bush thought of the
attempt by employees in the White House complex to stop random drug
testing of some 1,500 of the 1,850 employees in the Executive
Office of the President.
   The spokesman replied that Bush was ``concerned that they don't
understand the need for random drug testing and the need to take
steps to make sure that we keep drugs out of the federal service.
... The evidence is considerable on the importance of random drug
testing and curbing drug use.''

   Male insects whose pursuit of sex leads them
to ravage peach trees are being drawn by an artificial perfume into
wearing themselves out on plastic strips instead.
   Scientists are holding out hope that the method of pest control
by way of birth control will cost less and be safer than
insecticides being used on peach trees.
   The male pests are the lesser peachtree borer, which attacks the
trunk or limbs of the tree, and the larva of a close relative, the
peachtree borer, which chews at the base and roots.
   Both are looking for female borers and are drawn by the scent
into thinking they have found potential mates. But it's a fatal
attraction, say Agriculture Department scientists.
   ``It works like this,'' said entomologist J. Wendell Snow. ``The
insects try to mate daily, from around 11 a.m. until about 2 p.m.
for about two weeks, the lifespan of adults. When the male futilely
approaches the (scent's) dispenser repeatedly, he becomes totally
confused and exhausted.''
   Femalo compete with the artificial sex
scents, remain barren, thereby breaking the reproductive chain, or
egg-larvae-adult cycle.
   The five-yeact, described by the department's
Agricultural Research Serviceled by entomologist J. Wendell
Snow, who delved into the sex scents, or pheromones, emitted by the
female borers.
   Snow, who is in charge he Southeastern Fruit and Tree Nut
Research Laboratory in Byron, Ga., hung disprs containing the
artificial sc in each peach tree of the test ds.
   The sex attractants, whn the tops of test trees,
``achieved almost complete control'' of the borers in several
orchards in central Georgia, he said.
   Snow said t pheromone dispensers, which are made of plastic
and resemble tash bag twist ties, are being reviewed by the
Environmental Pro use.
   The lesser borer resides in Canada and the eastern United
States, while the peachtre inhabits most of the United
States. The pests cost American peach growers an eted $20
million annually.
   Only two chemical pesticides _ Lre
approved for control of the e pheromones leave no
residue (on fruit) and are expected to be cost competitivh

   Meanwhile, researchers are evaluating the pheromones for
effectiveness under different groions in South Carolina,

   First lady Barbara Bush is taking medication
to control a thyroid disorder that produced an eye irritation and
caused her to joke she would have dropped a few dress sizes had the
condition gone unchecked.
   After taking the medication for four days, Mrs. Bush has
``noticed marked improvement in her eye symptoms,'' her press
office said Wednesday in a statement.
   The statement said Mrs. Bush suffers from Graves disease and
sought treatment after ``mild swelling and irritation of the eyes
and some loss of weight.''
   Mrs. Bush told a group of reporters Wednesday that she did not
know about the overactive thyroid condition until her eyes started
bothering her although she had lost about 18 pounds over the past
several months. ``The thyroid just went wacko,'' she said.
   ``I might have gone down to a size 6,'' said Mrs. Bush, who
would not reveal her new size. But then she added, ``How can any
grown-up in America be so dumb as to think weight would just fall
off?''
   ``Now, please don't have me dying,'' she joked.
   Sondra Haley, a press aide to Mrs. Bush, said the condition,
which included swelling and watering in her eyes, was ``completely
under control.''
   ``It'swas more of an eye irritation,'' Ms.
Haley said.
   ``Other than mild eye discomfort, Mrs. Bush has felt fine and
kept her usual active schedule,'' the statement said.
   confirmed by blood tests last Friday at Walter
Reed Army Medical Center which showed ``slight

   Medical tests on the first lady included a thyroid scan and an
electrocardiograph.
   Mrs. Bush is under the care of White House physicians and an
expert in thyroid disorders at Walter Reed, the statement said.
   She has been taking methimazole, a drug that bocks the

Some patients also develop swelling in tissues of the eye,

   Millions of Americans with arthritis must
decide between enduring painful, swollen joints or risking the
development of a bleeding gastric ulcer, according to a new survey
of physicians.
   The Arthritis Foundation said that a survey of 1,009 physicians
who treat arthritis patients showed that 93 percent of the doctors
believe that aspirin, ibuprofen and some prescription
anti-inflammatory drugs are the most useful of a limited number of
medications available to treat arthritis.
   But the survey also found that 81 percent of the doctors regard
ulcers and other digestive problems to be the most serious
complication in the treatment of arthritis. The survey was released
today.
   ``When you look at the number of patients who take this
medication, it becomes a major health problem,'' said Dr. Naurang
M. Agrawal, a physician on an Arthritis Foundation advisory panel.
He said about one in every five arthritis patients taking aspirin
and the other so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) develop some type of gastric problem as a result.
   And yet, he said, the NSAIDs remain the most effective drugs for
control of the pain and swelling from arthritis.
   The Arthritis Foundation said in a statement that in the United
States about 37 million men, women and children _ about one in
every seven Americans _ suffer from some form of arthritis.
Arthritis is actually a family of more than 100 specific diseases,
but the most common are osteroarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
There is no cure for either of these common forms, and treatment
for both concentrates on relieving joint pain, swelling, stiffness
and other symptoms.
   Osteroarthritis, the most common form, affects the elderly the
most often and few who live past 60 escape at least a mild symptom.
In severe cases, joints degenerate until they are useless and, in
some cases, must be surgically replaced by implants.
   Rheumatoid arthritis strikes usually in middle age and can lead
quickly to disability in severe cases. In addition to joint
swelling and pain, symptoms can include fever and fatigue.
   Both of these types of arthritis are characterized by
inflammation in the joints. Aspirin and other NSAIDs are effective
because they control inflammation by inhibiting the production of
prostaglandin, a hormone-like protein that is active in the
inflammation process.
   But Agrawal said that while the NSAIDs block prostaglandins at
the joints, the drugs also deplete the hormones in the stomach and
intestines where prostaglandins provide protection from ulcer
development.
   The result, said Agrawal, is that arthritis patients are
relieved of joint pain, but then may suddenly develop ulcers.
   ``It is a very serious problem that is just now being addressed
seriously,'' he said.
   The danger of developing ulcers applies mostly to those who must
take large, daily doses of the NSAIDs in order to control
inflammation. Occasional aspirins or other headache medicines post
little ulcer hazard, experts say.
   Last December, the Food and Drug Administration recognized the
problem by ordering that NSAIDs carry warnings about ulcers or
damage to the stomach from a chronic, daily dosage.
   The FDA recently approved a new drug, misoprostol, for the
prevention of gastric ulcers caused by chronic NSAID medication.
The drug, marketed as Cytotec by G. D. Searle &amp; Co., permits most
arthritis patients to take anti-inflammatory drugs without risking
ulcers, but misoprostol can promote diarrhea in some patients and
can cause miscarriage in pregnant women.

   The kids at the circus gasp at the Whirling
Wheel of Death and ooh over the amazing Tahar, the alligator tamer
from Morocco, but they usually save their biggest ovations for the
lowly elephant sweepers.
   That's show biz.
   When the ringmaster at the visiting Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;
Bailey Circus introduces the next act _ ``a million pounds of
performing pachyderms'' _ 16 elephants lumber gracefully into the
spotlight, followed by a half-dozen anonymous men in blue jumpsuits
and carrying brooms and shovels.
   For the next few minutes, 16 elephants dance through their
intricately choreographed routine with sequined showgirls.
Meanwhile, the sweepers are performing their own desperate minuet,
dodging a swaying trunk or a thundering hoof to keep the three
circus rings nice and tidy.
   The kids in the bleacher seats, and many of the grownups, howl
with delight, especially when a man in blue smilingly holds his
shovel under an elephant's tail.
   ``Sometimes the sweepers get more applause than the performers
get,'' said Scottish-born stablemaster Tommy Henry, 56, who's swept
up his share of elephant manure during 40 years of circus work.
   ``The public likes it,'' he said. ``They think it's funny. Most
of the guys think it's a big joke.''
   A million pounds of performing pachyderms produces a lot of
pounds of manure.
   Ringling's entire animal menagerie, in fact, fills a
30-cubic-yard metal trash bin every day, says general manager Mike
Melssen. A private contractor is paid to haul it away, except when
the circus hosts a ``manure giveaway'' as a promotional gimmick.
   ``Elephant manure is the most potent fertilizer in the world,''
said circus spokeswoman Kim Turpin Davis, with the unabashed
hyperbole for which Ringling is famous.
   ``It will grow tomatoes as big as beach balls,'' she said. ``It
will grow spinach as powerful as Popeye's.''
   Ms. Davis said the stuff is so highly prized that someone in
Houston, responding to a Ringling newspaper ad, drove his truck up
to the circus the night before an elephant manure giveaway and
stole the whole aromatic pile.
   ``We put out an all points bulletin but it was never
recovered,'' she said.

   President Bush is easily winning Democratic
support for his choice of moderate black Republican Wayne A. Budd
as U.S. attorney for Massachusetts.
   Bush on Wednesday announced his intention to nominate Budd, a
47-year-old Boston lawyer, to succeed Frank L. McNamara Jr., a
conservative who left office Jan. 30 amid accusations that he used
his prosecutorial powers for political ends.
   Budd has been appointed to state posts by both Democrats and
Republicans and has experience as a prosecutor and in private
practice.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the state's senior senator and
a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, will back Budd, an aide
said.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis, who had pushed for McNamara's resignation,
applauded the selection, praising Budd for his ``enthusiasm,
integrity, balance and professionalism.''
   The nomination is expected to win easy Senate confirmation.
   Budd, a 1967 graduate of Wayne State University School of Law,
served from 1969 to 1971 as an assistant state attorney general and
chief of the state civil rights and liberties division under
Democratic Attorney General Robert H. Quinn.
   In 1972, Budd was appointed by Republican Gov. Francis W.
Sargent as a member of the state Civil Service Commission, and was
named commission chairman b Dukakis in 1983. He served as chairman
until 1987.
   The son of a Springfield policeman, Budd also served as
president of the Massachusetts Bar Association from 1979 to 1980.
   The Bush administration had been considering Budd and Robert S.
Mueller, who had been the No. 2 federal prosecutor in Massachusetts
under former U.S. Attorney William F. Weld.
   Bush, anxious to promote minorities to high-ranking government
posts, favored Budd while Thornburgh wanted Mueller because of his
more extensive prosecutorial experience, The Boston Globe reported.
   Budd will be made an interim appointee to the post until he cuts
his ties with his private law practice, which is expected within
several weeks.

<HEAD>US Yields on Demand to Eliminate Farm Subsidies Internationally</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials reluctantly concede they will
have to accept a compromise with Europe over elimination of farm
price supports in order to avert the collapse of international
trade talks.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Wednesday that he had
agreed to a formula that would call for ``progressive substantial
reductions'' of agricultural subsidies. The United States had
originally sought the use of the word ``elimination'' of subsidies.
   ``What we have tried to do is state it in a manner that might be
a little more palatable politically to our European counterparts,''
Yeutter said in an interview on National Public Radio.
   Asked if this was a compromise compared with the hardline
position he took at international trade talks in Montreal last
December, Yeutter answered, ``Not much.'' He added that the
proposed formula ``will get us to the ultimate objective of getting
rid of trade-distorting kind of practices in agriculture around the
world.''
   Another Agriculture Department official, speaking on condition
he not be identified, said the EEC had indicated to U.S.
negotiators that it would accept the compromise. This could pave
the way for progress at a meeting next Wednesday in Geneva of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The Montreal meeting of cabinet members from the 96 GATT members
broke down over the agricultural clash between the United States
and the 12-nation EEC, with members refusing to act on other
pressing trade issues until the dispute is resolved.
   The EEC, which has powerful farming interests, balked at the
U.S. demand for total elimination of the subsidies and was only
willing to discuss reducing the supports.
   The United States contends that the supports for production and
export of agricultural products distort world market prices and
force the administration to prop up American farmers to the tune of
some $25 million annually so they can compete abroad.
   The U.S. position on farm supports has been gradually eroding
since last year, when former President Reagan dropped his original
goal for the worldwide elimination of farm subsidies by the year
2000.
   The United States then took the position that it was not setting
any date for elimination of the supports but was seeking instead a
commitment from all GATT members for eventual elimination.
   In the absence of such a commitment, the United States intends
to press the EEC at the Geneva meeting to reduce its export subsidy
for farmers. Yeutter said the United States has had to keep up with
the Europeans by increasing export supports for farmers and ``it's
really sheer economic madness.''
   Another potential sticking point in Geneva is a new EEC demand
that the United States freeze current limitations on the size of
farm lands used for production. The United States asked farmers to
idle some lands last year because of the drought.
   Yeutter said he would reject the EEC demand.
   ``The European community is trying to lock us into that position
forever and we just can't afford to have that take place,'' he said.
   Agriculture Department officials say they will decide by June 1
whether to maintain the existing limitations on farm production,
depending on their determination of the past winter's drought
damage.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says drug
users must be presented with their ``share of the bill'' for the
nation's drug problems, but he doesn't plan to send out swarms of
agents to nab them in the act.
   ``It's obvious that it would not be a maximum efficient use of
resources just to start clapping everybody who's a drug user into
jail or trying to fine them civilly,'' Thornburgh said Wednesday
during a luncheon with reporters.
   ``But that deterrent effect is going to be utilized,'' he said.
``That, I hope, would cause people to think twice about their own
personal use.''
   He does not intend to go back to an extreme ``zero tolerance''
policy under which agents seized boats when a single marijuana
cigarette was found on them. ``But if you've got half a ton of coke
on board a yacht and we find it, you're not going to have the yacht
very long.''
   Speaking shortly after he announced the indictments of 127
people on drug and money-laundering charges, Thornburgh said, ``We
talked this morning about a billion dollar money-laundering
operation.
   ``Every one of those billion dollars came from American citizens
who buy and use and abuse drugs and violate the laws and suborn our
values on a daily basis, 's going to ultimately be won,'' he said.
``We're going to be a nation that reects the notion that a
drug-depet lifestyle is an admissible lifestyle. Then an only then
are w to make progress on the drug front.''
   While he said he doesn't plan to arrest individual drug users as
eaid he instructed investigators and prosecutors to press charge,''
including white-collar workers who serve as role models.
   ``Don't let mimpression that we're sending swarms of agents out
there concentrated on so-called recreational drug users,'' he said.
``But I will not rule out using any of these tools against the drug
user because it is the drug user which finances the drug trafficker
that has to bsented with his or her share ofbill. It'll happen.''
   On other issues, Thornburgh said:
   _He is concerned about erosion people seeking federal law
enforcement jobs because of the low pay being offered. ``I've
pledery outspoken proponent of their needs'' before the pay study
commission established by Congress, he said. The commission is
tings in June.
   _He is impatient to get his own staff in plac ``short lists'' of
candidates for virtually all the agencies his department os, such
as the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Marsvice and
others. ``The short list, in some casedes the incumbent,'' he said.
   _He may not appoint anybody to replace Frank Keating as assoe
attorney general, the third-ranking post in the Justice Department,
and a ``couple of other positions'' are also under revie _He plans
no more audits of any agencies such as those that se operations of
the INS and the Marshals Service because the results were leaked to
the news media. ``I'm never going to run an,'' he said.
   ``They're suppo be management tools and not hammers to be used
to embarrass people,'' he said.

   The United States is rejecting Soviet calls
for a special United Nations investigation into U.S. and Pakistani
support for the rebels in Afghanistan.
   ``There is no need at this time for the Security Council to
review the situation in Afghanistan now that Soviet troops have
withdrawn,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
Wednesday.
   The United Nations sponsored the Geneva accords that produced
the Soviet pullout, which was completed in mid-February. The
Soviets say the United States and Pakistan are arming the rebels in
violation of the accords.
   Ms. Tutwiler said that there ``are currently adequate procedures
to deal with alleged violations of the accords.''
   The Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Alexander
Belonogov, said in New York he was asking the world body to set up
checkpoints on the Afghan-Pakistani border to prevent arms and
troops from reaching Moslem guerrillas. suggested that a meeting of
the Council to discuss the alleged violations could be useful.
   ul, President Najibullah announced he was sending a letter to
Ucretary General Perez de Cuellar with a similar request.
   They contend that last April's Geneva accords barred outside
intervention in the Afghan war.
   Pakistan supports the guerrillhaving troops in Afghanistan.
   The Soviets contend that the weapons left behind by its
withdrawing troops are not outlawed by the Geneva accords.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the administration believes the United Nations
``is fulfilling ision in accordance with the Geneds'' and sees no
need for any expansion of its role.

   Parents could jeopardize the health of their
babies and toddlers by feeding them according to the same
high-fiber, low-fat nutritional regime they follow themselves,
nutrition and health experts say.
   In addition, the experts say, sugar and sodium in moderate
amounts contribute to a well-balanced infant diet.
   These points are included in new infant dietary guidelines
developed by Gerber Products Co. and based on published statements
of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Dietetic
Association.
   ``The key message is that babies need to be fed like babies, not
like adults,'' said Dr. Guy Johnson, director of infant nutrition
for Gerber.
   ``Avoiding fat and cholesterol is becoming more popular among
h-conscious adults, but it may be too restrictive for rapidly gneed
about two and a half times more calories per day, pound for pound,

   The ``Dietarants,'' outlined in a 19-page booklet, are billed by

   The company said the Dietary Guiblished jointly by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human

   Susan Welsh, director of nutrition education at e Department,
said the infant guidelines ``provide very useful e not
inconsistent'' with the department's guidelines, which in brief

   The Americatrics, the largest professional association of
pediatricians, said it agreed with the infant guidelines, but noted
that it does not endorse Gerber's nor any other commercial products.
    E. Strain, executive director of the academy, said the
guidelines are patterned after statements that have been published
previously by the academy's Committe on Nutrition about babies' nu.
   ``We think there is a need for parents to know that diets for

adults,'' he said.
   The guidelines include _Parents shouldtrict the amount of fat

   _Skim milk nd other reduceds are not recommended because they

   The National Transportation Safety Board,
which is investigating the cause of the Alaskan oil spill, is
concerned that individuals with revoked auto driver's licenses
sometimes are allowed to pilot airliners or oil tankers.
   Board investigators at the spill site said they were focusing on
actions by the ship's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, whose driver's
license had been revoked three times in drunken driving incidents
while he held the highest-level license granted a ship's captain.
   Hazelwood had turned over the bridge to his third mate who was
notnsed to operate the ship in the Prince William Sound where it
ran aground Friday, spilling moremillion gallons of crude oil that
has spread over 500 square miboard spokesman in Washington, said
investigators have not determined whether alcohol contributoil
spill but he said they were aware of news reports concerninlleged
record of alcohol abuse.
   Lopatkiewicz said he did not know whether investigators had
examined Hazelwood's highway dving records in Huntington,
N.Y.hometown.
   He board had long been concerned with policies that allow
airline pilots, ships'aptains and other people with mansportation
safety responsibilities to remain on the job while not being
allowed to drive a ca because of alcohol abuse.
   Hazelwood's driver's license was revoked in 1984 when he refuse
take a breathalleaded guilty to drunken driving near his home. He
was convicted of drunken driving in New Hampshire last September
and his license remained revoked from that incident, authorities in
New York said.
   Alaska's public safety commissioner, Art English, said the Coast
a state trooper to investigate a report that Hazelwood had been
drinking before he boarded the ship Thursday night.
   Coast Guard spokesman Randy Peterson said officials would await
the results of the NTSB investigation before deciding whether
disciplinary action might be taken against Hazelwood or any other
officer of the Exxon Valdez.
   NTSB investigations normally take about a year to complete, and
spokesman Lopatkiewicz said the board would not issue any
recommendations of action against an individual before its probe is
complete.
   Toast Guard deferred to the NTSB oil spill investigation,
Peterson said, because the service might be one subject of the
investigation. It has the responsibility of monitoring traffic in
the sound.
   Frk Flyntz, a Coast Guard licensing official, said that an
applicant on the ladder to becoming a ship's captain could be
denied a license based on a history of alcohol abuse or drunken
driving convictions.
   But he said ld tke action before an administrative law judge to
revoke a license once it isanted. Such action could be based on
negligence, misconduct or id.
   Flyntz said Hazelwood, because his license allowed him to
operate the est ships, was a highly qualified ship's master who had
passed extensive training and licensing procedures.
   Licenses for merchant ships' officers have to be renewed every
five years.
   Coast Guard records show thatd's license was issued for the
third five-year period in New Yoon Dec. 12, 1986, declaring him
``master of ocean steam or motor vessels of any gross tons.'' He
also was qualfied as a radar navigator and was licensed for Prince
William SCousins, whom Flyntz described as ``a highly qualified
individual,'' was licensed last Jan. 12 s as a second mate, one
degree higher than the post he had on the Exxon Valdezwas qualified
as a radar navigatch would include the ability to use radar to spot
the shorelinen underwater reef. He did not have the ``pilotage
endorsement'' necessary to pilot a ship throuthe sound.
   Pilotage licenses for specific waterways have ar Flyntz said,
including the ability to take a blank piece of paper and map the
waterway with alational marks, shipping channels and depths from
memory.
   Joseph Angelo, as of the Coast Guard's merchant l inspection and
documentation division, said the Exxon Valdez, built in 1986, meets
all the latest construction and equipment requirements, including
the instion of ballasts that can help prevent oil spills in some
instances.
   ``It's a very new ship. I don't see any deficiencies at all,''
said Angelo.
   ``The current standards that exist the most modern tankers are
good,'' said Angelo. ``But no matter what you do, you can't cover
ry possible aspect if human error is involved.''

<TEXT>
   Latin America's foreign debt burden is
threatening democracy by making Marxist alternatives attractive to
the people, who must endure the austerity programs creditors
demand, President Jose Sarney says.
   In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Sarney
said the debt burden is giving Latin Americans a sense that ``a
democratic regime, free enterprise, is incapable of solving the
problems of each country.''
   ``No regime can survive if it cannot at least offer solutions
forts people,'' said Sarney, who sphe Palace of the Dawn, the
presidential residene.
   Sarney, a 58-year-old poet and rancher, took office in 1985 in a
military-mandated Electoral College elction after 21 years of
right-wing military rule.
   But chronic economic problems, including a $115 billion debt and
1,000 percent inflatione led to increased popularity of leftist
parties in advance of presidential election.
   It will be Brazil's free presidential election in 29 years.
   Under the constituay not run for re-election.
   ``The transition (to civilian rule) has brought parties with
totalitarian tendies into the democratic game,'' Sarney said.
``While we haven't had military upngs or serious social upheavals,
we also don't have groups of subversives or ones who deny
democratic values.''
   However, Sarney said Latin America's foreign debt was a threat
to democrBrazil and the rest of the region. Latin American nations
owe foreign creditors more than $400 billion, and Bra debt is the
largest.
   ``Democracy is losing ground in Latin America because the
solution ittend national problems. We offer pessimistic solutions,
and the parties of the left (offer) optimistic ones,'' he said.
   Brazil has made a ``brutal efforand paid a ``very high
politica'' trying to meet debt payments and enact the austerity
measures recommended byand the International Monetary Fund to
qualify for loans.
   In the past four years, he said, Brazil has paid its creditors
about $50 billion in interest, ``money which would have allowed the
implantation of a gigantic program of national development.''
   ``We don't have anything left to cut. Alan do is paralyze the
country, stop the administrative machine,'' he said.
   Brazil suspende interest payments on part of it foreign debt for
10 months in his year it said it could declare another moratorium.
   Sarney said Brazil doesn't want a confrontation with its
creditors.
   ``We want a negotiated solution to reduce the debt, together
with other mechanisms outside the market,'' the president said. He
praised a proposal by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bady to help
nations buy back their debt at a di`We want to pay the debt, but
not if it means ireparable damage to the economy. Commenting on
recent riots in Venezuela sparked by economic problems there,
Sarney said Brazil ``has shown great maturity getting along with
its problems without going to extremes.''
   He said Brazilians ``have not been seduced by the temptation of
violence or easy demagogic solutions for difficult problems.'' But
he said the government has a ``great social debt'' to its 144
million people.

<TEXT>
   A publishing house in western China has been
binding 30 pages of a pornographic novel into elementary school
grammar books, an official newspaper reported today.
   The China Daily News said officials at the publishing house had
yet to determine if a worker planned the escapade or their machines
malfunctioned.
   Segments of the novel, ``Thoughts Under The Sun _ Dirty Ghosts
From A Dark Cantonese Corner,'' began appearing in Elementary
School No. 10 Grammar Book, published this year.
   So far, the paper said, it is unclear how many books included
the pornography but 58,000 copies of the grammar book were printed
nationwide.
   According to the report, the pornographic segment begins right
after the grammar book's title page.
   ``Chapter Three: Modern Prostitution,'' reads one section.
``Part 1, Angels and Beasts. Part 2, Heaven and Nymphs. Part 3,
Girls Looking For Fun.''
   ``What follows is too dirty to read,'' the paper said.
   Families around Xian, a major city in western China, first
discovered the books. Now they are demanding a recall.
   ``It doesn't seem like the publishing company has much quality
control,'' said the father of one student. ``If they do, is it
possible that they think the children need this kind of
enlightenment?''
   According to the head of the Shanxi Province Printing Factory,
the grammar book was printed at the same time as ``Thoughts Under
The Sun.''
   But, he said, an investigation of the problem had yet to
determine how it occurred.
   ``Maybe it was a mistake, but maybe it involved a worker unhappy
with the factory,'' he said.
   ``Thoughts Under The Sun'' is a popular book and has gone
through several printings.
   Since 1978 and China's opening to the West, pornography of both
Western and Chinese origin has become increasingly popular.

   State Treasurer A. James Manchin vowed
he would remain in office even though he was impeached for the loss
of $279 million in an investment fund he oversaw.
   ``When you consider the leadership of the House ... that's
behind all of this, and how they've been twisting arms and pushing,
I'm not surprised at the outcome of this vote,'' Manchin said after
the House of Delegates voted 65-34 to impeach him on 17 of 18
articles Wednesday.
   ``I have committed no wrong. I'm going to stay around as long as
I can.''
   The 61-year-old two-term Democrat said he would remain in office
even though conviction in the Senate would mean that he could never
run for office again and the immediate loss of his $50,000 a year
job. It likely would jeopardize a pension estimated at $2,128 a
month, too.
   He faces removal from office if convicted by a two-thirds vote
of the 34-member Senate.
   Senate President Larry Tucker said that in consultation with
state Supreme Court Chief Justice W.T. Brotherton Jr., he has set a
tentative date of June 12 to begin what he expects to be a
monthlong trial. Brotherton will act as chief judge at the
impeachment trial.
   The impeachment resolution blamed Manchin for delegating too
much authority and failing to supervise the consolidated investment
fund, where the losses occurred primarily in April, May and June
1987.
   The resolution also blamed him with making improper investments
with state fund, paying out interest that was not earned and
covering up the losses.
   The House vote came after more than six hours of debate
Wednesday.
   Most of the debate centered on a substitute motion to censure
Manchin, but that was rejected 60-39.
   Delegate James Pitrolo defended Manchin as a man who trusted
subordinates who betrayed him, the common argument advanced by
Manchin, who said he knew nothing about finances and hired
subordinates to do the work.
   The House voted to drop one count, based on Manchin's decision
to hire Arnold Margolin as his assistant treasurer in charge of
investments. Manchin has blamed Margolin, at various times during
the impeachment hearings called a financial whiz kid and economic
genius, for causing the losses and hiding them from him.
   The House of Delegates also decided on 70-28 vote to censure
four-term Auditor Glen Gainer for his actions in the loss of the
funds that were under the overall supervision of a board on which
he and Manchin served.
   The censure motion means nothing legally against Gainer, except
to give him a blot on his record as a state official. He and
Manchin were on the state Board of Investments, which had general
supervision over the fund, while the treasurer's office had direct
investment powers.

<HEAD>First Licensed Commercial Rocket Makes Successful Launch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. industry was
launched into the space exploration business with the blastoff of
the first licensed commercial spacecraft, officials said.
   The successful, 15-minute suborbital voyage Wednesday of the
Consort 1 should convince potential investors and customers that
private businesses can send a payload into space safely and
reliably, said Carol Lane, director of the Department of
Transportation office that issued the pioneer launch license.
   ``I think we'll see growth,'' she said minutes after the slender
rocket shot its payload of scientific experiments 178 miles high.
``The commercial space industry has been slow to develop, and this
is one of the most positive developments we've seen in a long
time.''
   The 630-pound payload capsule went through about seven minutes
of near weightlessness, then parachuted gently onto the desert
floor of White Sands Missile Range about 58 miles north of the
launch pad.
   A preliminary look at the payload contents showed the flight was
successful, said David Dooling, spokesman for the University of
Alabama-Huntsville, which sponsored the project.
   ``As far as we can tell, the scientific instruments worked well,
but we don't have any results yet,'' he said. ``We think this is an
outstanding beginning, not only for space exploration but for space
experimentation.''
   The payload included experiments designed to measure how liquids
mix in weightlessness, how plastic foam forms and cures, how
liquids coat glass surfaces, how epoxy reacts in weightlessness and
how finely powdered metals bond under high temperature to produce
alloys.
   About 100 spectators cheered as the rocket streaked from its
launch pad, spewing yellow flame and leaving a white trail.
   The rocket dropped its first stage six seconds and more than a
mile into the voyage, and disappeared from sight in about 25
seconds.
   Most of the observers were employees or family members of
employees of Space Services Inc., the Houston-based company that
provided the rocket and launch services for the Consort 1.
   Space Services launched the Conestoga 1 rocket in September
1982, the first space shot by a private company. That rocket
carried a dummy payload, and the launch was carried out before the
Transportation Department had formulated guidelines for licensing
private spacecraft.
   The Consort 1 was the first to be licensed and carry a real
payload.
   To launch Conestoga 1, Space Services had to deal with 18
government agencies. The Reagan administration directed the
Transportation Department to issue launch licenses and cut through
government red tape on private industry's behalf.
   ``When we went up in '82, there was no infrastructure for
commercial launches,'' said Bill Vance, Space Services' vice
president of finance and administration. ``We've been working a
long time to put up a successful launch. It's been a six-year
countdown. We've been on long hold.''
   The Consort 1 was a suborbital voyage, meaning it went into
space and back down again without circling the earth. But Space
Services plans a much more ambitious project to put a satellite
into orbit, possibly late next year, company spokesman Mark Daniels
said.
   The cost of the Consort 1 has been pegged at $1 million to $2
million. Daniels said he expects Space Services' annual revenues to
reach $100 million to $500 million once it starts sending
satellites into orbit.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stocks Hit Another High, Dollar Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices closed today at another record high on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the U.S. dollar lost ground against
the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which rose 430.92 points on
Wednesday, added another 88.85 points, or 0.27 percent, ending the
day at 32,826.13.
   The Nikkei index lost 74.05 points during the morning session
because of profit-taking, but then recovered as individual
investors began buying shipbuilding and chemical issues in the
afternoon, dealers said.
   ``Investors appear not to be very concerned about factors such
as U.S. inflation'' and exchange rates, said Tetsuo Ushijima, an
analyst for Nomura Securities. ``It seems unlikely that the dollar
will continue to rise,'' he added.
   Trading, led by individual players, was active, with volume on
the market's first section estimated at 1.4 billion shares,
compared to 1.3 billion traded on Wednesday.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar finished trading at
132.80 yen, down 0.45 yen from Wednesday's closing of 133.25 yen.
After opening slightly higher at 133.27 yen, the U.S. currency
edged down, ranging between 132.78 and 133.30 yen during the day.
   The dollar weakened as Japanese investors reduced their dollar
buying, mainly due to position adjustments, said a trader with the
Bank of Tokyo.
   ``Concerted central bank intervention in the United States and
Europe for the last two days also indirectly helped stop the
dollar's recent rise,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. and European central banks intervened in currency markets
on Tuesday and Wednesday in an attempt to stabilize the dollar.
   Other dealers said market players were reluctant to continue
buying dollars because of the upcoming Group of Seven (G-7) meeting
of finance officials from major industrialized nations.
   The G-7 meeting is scheduled to be held in Washington on Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan is being asked by a group of senators to extend a program
that provides the drug AZT to AIDS victims who cannot afford the
costly treatment.
   The program is due to expire Friday.
   ``Without swift action by the administration, lifesaving
treatments will be abruptly terminated for thousands of people with
AIDS,'' said the letter signed by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and 11 others.
   Two weeks ago, the Senate turned back a Kennedy-sponsored bill
to extend the program when three Republican critics refused to let
the measure be acted on without debate or consideration of
amendments.
   Kennedy's bill would require the Department of Health and Human
Services to redirect $5 million in federal AIDS funds to the AZT
program for use through September.
   Currently nearly 7,000 AIDS victims are receiving AZT under the
program. The average cost of the drug treatment is $600 a month.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deliveries of the Army's new Beretta 9mm
pistol won't resume until May because efforts to correct a fault in
the gun have taken longer than expected, officials say.
   ``We have a design approved, but the production didn't get up
and running as quickly as we had hoped,'' says Lt. Col. John Reitz,
an Army spokesman at the Pentagon. `We don't expect deliveries with
the new design to begin until May.''
   In the meantime, the Army has decided to reduce by two-thirds
the number of times guns already in use may be fired before
replacing the chamber slide mechanism, the defective part.
   Noting an accident earlier this year in which a chamber slide
shattered, the Army reduced from 3,000 to 1,000 the number of
firings allowed before the slide was replaced.
   Beretta USA, which operates a manufacturing plant in Accokeek,
Md., beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide
9mm guns to replace the military's venerable Colt .45. Beretta USA
is a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker Armi Beretta SpA and has
so far delivered more than 140,000 pistols. It agreed in August to
suspend deliveries, starting in September, until it corrected the
problem of cracking slides.

   Parents don't deserve a tax break for paying
tuition to send their children to private schools, President Bush
says.
   ``Everybody should support the public school system and then, if
on top of that, your parents think that they want to shell out in
addition to the tax money, tuition money, that's their right,''
Bush told a student group. ``But I don't think they should get a
break for that.''
   He said ``it is the obligation of all taxpayers to support a
public education system.''
   The Reagan administration had supported the idea of tuition tax
credits for parents who send their children to private schools, but
dropped the idea in a major overhaul of the tax system.
   Bush made his comments in a question and answer session with 75
students spending a week in Washington as part of a program to give
youths an inside look at government. The program is sponsored by
Close Up, a non-partisan, educational foundation.

<TEXT>
   The very young or very old make up the
majority of Americans living in poverty, the Census Bureau says.
   Some 40 percent of the total 32.5 million poor Americans were
under 18, while those 65 or over constituted 10.7 percent of
impoverished people, the bureau reported.
   The report, ``Poverty in the United States: 1987,'' expanded on
a study of income and poverty issued last August. The earlier
analysis found nearly one-third of all black Americans living in
poverty.
   ``The poverty rate for children continues, as it has since 1975,
to be higher than that for other age groups,'' the new report said.
   Some 20.6 percent of the 63.2 million Americans under age 18
were listed as living in poverty compared with 13.5 percent of all
Americans.
   This is a result of a number of factors, including the increase
of single-parent households and problems in collecting
child-support from the absent parent, said Ann Kittlaus of the Food
Research and Action Council, a private, anti-poverty group.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of riot police battled
workers at the nation's largest shipyard today in an attempt to end
three months of violent strikes by activists demanding recognition
for their union.
   Ten thousand riot police stormed the Hyundai yard in Ulsan
before dawn and fired hundreds of tear gas shells from rifles and
helicopters as strikers retreated to a company dormitory complex,
police and news reports said.
   About 700 striking workers wearing headbands, helmets and
brandishing steel clubs held police at a standoff at the
dormitories for more than six hours before police charged again,
firing tear gas, the Yonhap news agency reported.
   Strikers fought back with water from firehoses, firebombs, rocks
and steel clubs, the South Korean news agency said, and police
gained control of one of the six buildings in the dormitory
complex. Police officials said 200 workers were arrested.
   About 1,000 militant members of an independent labor union
Hyundai refuses to recognize have been staging increasingly violent
protests at the 22,000-worker yard 150 miles southeast of Seoul
since Dec. 12.
   The strikers, who also demand higher pay, have periodically
forced the yard to shut down and the government intervened after
repeated requests from Hyundai. The unrest has repeatedly stalled
operations at the shipya cost the company millions of dollars in
lost revenues.
   The shipyard is a subsidiary of the Hyundai group, the country's
largest conglomerate. Hyundai also owns Hyundai Motor Co., producer
of the popular Hyundai automobiles that are sold in the Uniates.
   Police in combat fati and helmets took over the shipyard just
before dawn today after bulldozers andt trucks tore down iron and
steel barricades erected by strikers. About 1,000 police arrived b
sea in boats.
   The workers fled to the dorm complex and refused police demands
that they surrender. Mattreme of the dormitories to prevent suicide
jumps, police said.
   Police confiscated hundreds of firebombs, clubs, canisters of
propane gas and homemade explosives, Yonhap reported.
   About 10,000 workerociated with the strike were allowed into the
yard to work today.
   The Labor Ministry said today that 422 pad been injured in
violence at the yard since December and that Hyundai has lost $810
million in business. Press reports said most workers at the
shipyard wanted to work.
   Meanwhile, 1,000 students at Ulsan University battled riot
police with firebombs and rocks when police stopped them from
marching to the shipyard to join the strikers, Yonhap reported.
Police said 200 wrs were arrested.
   And at Changwon, a provincial city on the south coast, ab 1,800
workers at the Hyundai Precision Co., another subsidiary of the
conglomerate, rallied in support of the striking workers.
   President Roh Tae-woo's government has warned it will take a
tough line against militant workers, who have staged a ser of often
violent strikes.
   The government urged companies to settle labor disputes
peacefully without official interference.

<HEAD>Important Dates in Drexel Investigation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Milken Indictment, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major developments in the investigation
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its high-yield bond financier
Michael R. Milken:
   May 12, 1986 _ The Securities and Exchange Commission charges
Dennis Levine of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with making $12.6
million in profits from illegal trading on inside information since
1980.

cooperate with the government's investigation and surrenders $11.6
million in illicit profits and restitution.
   Nov. 14 _ Stock speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay a $100
million penalty to settle charges of trading on insider information
supplied by Levine in 1985 and 1986. He also agrees to cooperate
with investigators in a much broader investigation of Drexel and
its chief financier, Michael Milken.

   The 61st annual Academy Awards on ABC wasn't
the longest Oscar Show on record _ it just seemed that way.
   Perhaps it wasn't even the most boring, although it certainly
seemed to be. It was a visual and aural equivalent of empty
calories. After Wednesday night's three hours and 15 minutes, you
still felt hungry.
   The show, as put together by producer Allan Carr, had a theme of
Hollywood couples. What it sadly lacked was a focus. It begged for
a host to tie it together. It desperately needed a Johnny Carson or
Chevy Chase, who were hosts in previous years, or even a Billy
Crystal or Robin Williams, who provided some of the night's only
laughs.
   It was a show without a single highlight, without a memorable
moment, without an emotional peak. It was flat from start to finish.
   The show's only surprise, the only relief in the tedium, was
Jodie Foster's win as best actress for her role in ``The Accused.''
   Nothing would have helped this show more than chopping its tacky
20-minute opening number and starting it with the presentation of
the best supporting actress award. Carr wanted a shiny vehicle to
pay tribute to Hollywood extravaganzas. What the ABC-TV audience
got was a flaming wreck.
   An interesting thing about the Oscar telecast is that every
producer starts fresh each year. No one ever seems to build on last
year's assets, no one ever seems to learn from previous mistakes.
   The biggest ongoing problem is that every new producer forgets
this is an awards show. The audience wants to see a competition.
They want to see the emotional highs of the winners, and the
let-down of the losers.
   The producers also forget this is a show about the movies. This
year's program seemed to have fewer film clips than any Oscarcast
in recent memory.
   The one thing the Oscar broadcast should not be, yet every
producer seems determined to make it such, is a variety show filled
with overblown production numbers. Next year's producer should be
forced to sign an oath: Remember the movies, forget the
extravaganza.
   The most quotable quote: Walter Matthau saying ``A stage hand
said the show was running long tonight.'' Maybe it should be called
`Awards and Remembrances,''' a reference to ABC's 30-hour
mini-series, ``War and Remembrance.''
   Show's best sight: Sean Connery and Roger Moore, two of the
movies' James Bonds, presenting the Oscar for best supporting actor
with Michael Caine.
   Show's funniest sight: Carrie Fisher and Martin Short in the
same dress.
   Show's best relief from the boredom: Billy Crystal doing Yul
Brynner as Babe Ruth, Edward G. Robinson as a gangster in ``The Ten
Commandments,'' and doing a tap dance sound-alike with a cough drop
in his mouth; and Robin Williams as an overgrown Mickey Mouse.
   A final thought: Douglas Fairbanks presented all of the Oscars
in five minutes at the first Academy Awards presentation in 1927.

<HEAD>Soviet Journalists Complain That Japanese Are Flying First</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet journalists say they are hurt they have
been passed over for the first commercial trip to the space station
Mir in favor of a Japanese reporter whose company can pay hard
currency.
   Complaints surfaced in the Soviet press today following the
announcement Monday that Tokyo Broadcasting System signed a
non-governmental deal with Glavkosmos, the Soviet civilian space
agency, to send a reporter to Mir in 1991 as part of its 40th
birthday celebration.
   The Japanese television company plans to pay $11.3 million for
the space flight, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist Youth League
newspaper, reported.
   ``How could this happen in the country that produced Gagarin and
Tereshkova?'' columnist Yaroslav Golovanov wrote in the paper,
referring to Yuri Gagarin and Valentina Tereshkova, the first man
and woman in space.
   ``Isn't it clear that such a deal rading for our civic dignity?
Don't our high-placed `cosmic merchants' understand that?'' Goloo
the Soviet government to annul the ``brazen contract.''
   da columnist A. Tarasov commentet was easy to guess why, when
Glavkosmos was deciding on its findifferently over the Soviet
press.''
   ``Alas, alas, we all ur pay in ordinary Soviet rublesn`t pay for
the flight in the convertible currency which Glavkodly,'' he wrote.
   In a related development this week, the Swiss advertising agency
Punto S.A. announced thaigned a deal with the Soviets to sell
advertising space on Soviet spaceships, launch pads and osmonaut
uniforms.
   The main exposure would be on the ground launches, which the
Soviets have indicated they want to open increasingly to Western TV
crews. A prime ``billboard'' also would be the Mir, which has space
for two company or product logos, said the company's Andrea Capra
said.
   The Soviets set up Glavkosmos in 1985 to supervise their
civilian space program and enter the world of commercial satellite
launching. The program has been hampered by Western restrictions on
ort of high technology.
   Writing in today's Komsomolskaya Pravda, Pyotr Polozhevetz
pointed out about Mir that the Japanese ``simply bought a ticket
for aight. It's a ticket that right now we can't afford.''
   The Soviet Union will be better off taking money from the
Japanese and spending its own resources on meat, clothes and
schools, he wrote.
   The flight is expected to last almost eight days.
   The Tokyo Broadcast System has begun a selects among almost 40
of its reporters, and plans to put two finalitwo-year Soviet
training course, deciding only at the last minute which one will
actually make trip, Komsomolskaya Pravda reported.

   The oil that has polluted Prince William
Sound is soiling Alaska's $500 million tourism industry, and some
fear losses from the nation's worst oil spill could last for years.
   Hardest hit since Friday's spill are small businesses operating
in the sound, where salmon fishing and spectacular glaciers draw
thousands of tourists each summer.
   Will Eason of Anchorage owns and operates Prince William Sound
Charters, which provided about 1,000 fishing and sightseeing trips
out of the coastal town of Whittier last year.
   ``I've lost probably about 50 percent of my bookings for this
summer,'' Eason said Wednesday. ``It's going to be devastating for
us.''
   Eason said he may be forced out of business.
   ``It's hard to say. This could even go on for years,'' said
Eason, whose business depends on repeat customers and their
referrals.
   He expects business to slow further as the extent of damage
becomes clear.
   The spill also is affecting tourist businesses hundreds of miles
away.
   ``We got over a dozen phone calls yesterday, not only from
individual clients but also from wholesalers from New York to
California who were wondering if they should be canceling their
trips to Alaska,'' said Ken Leghorn, owner of Alaska Discovery in
Juneau.
   Alaska Discovery provides camping and kayak trips in the
southeast panhandle and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, areas
hundreds of miles away from Prince William Sound.
   ``They're just assuming that such a large area is affected that
any coastline trip to Alaska is going to be not worth seeing,''
Leghorn said.
   Despite the problems some smaller businesses are reporting,
state tourism officials and representatives of large cruise ship
lines predict the overall damage to the industry, if any, will be
minimal.
   Cruise spokesmen report no itinerary changes, few calls and no
cancellations from tourists who have booked their summer vacations.
   ``We probably got between 10 and 20 calls from travel agents and
consumers in the last two days,'' said Rich Skinner of
Seattle-based Holland America Line-Westtours, the largest cruise
ship operator in Alaska waters. ``They're wondering how it will
impact their vacation, they're wondering how close it is to where
they're going.''
   Holland America, which last year took more than 79,000 people to
Alaska, has scheduled 68 cruises along the Alaska coast this year.
Sixteen of those are to pass through Prince William Sound.
   Columbia Glacier ruises Inc. in Anchorage operates a popular
150-passenger day cruise between Var in the sound. Division manager
Phil Broderick was optimistic nd will be made pristine again
despite the disaster.
   Otherimism.
   ``The tourism industry is a little bit hesitant to say anything
negative because of the impact it c sound this summer, and on the
image of Prince William Sound,'' said John Gans, marketing and
admissions direceadership School in Lander, Wyo.
   The school has offered wiless training courses in Prince William
Sound since 1970, and might cancel those courses this year.

   ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' an epic drama about
a boy and his father who must carve a new life in unforgiving
Danish farm country won Best Foreign film at the Academy Awards,
the second such honor for Denmark.
   The country won its first Oscar last year in ``Babette's
Feast.'' Wednesday night's nomination was Denmark's fifth in the
category.
   ``I made a film about a poor immigrant from Denmark and here I
am standing in my tuxedo and this shiny thing,'' said Bille August,
the film's director and writer, holding up his golden statue.
   Asked why the austere film was so popular, he said, ``It's a
story about human beings. It's a story about emotion. Everybody can
understand it. It inspires people all over the world with its
emotion.''
   The story is told through the eyes of Pelle Hvenegaard, a
Swedish boy who accompanies his widower father, played by Max Von
Sydow, on a perilous adventure early in the century. Von Sydow,
nominated for best actor, saw the award got to Dustin Hoffman for
his role in ``Rain Man.''
   Pelle finds his new home exciting and forbidding as he draws
inner strength from suffering. ``I think it means a lot to Danish
film,'' August said when asked about the significance of the award.
``It is very important to people in film in my country.''
   He'd like to do a sequel, but addet would be several years away.
His current project is ``The Hou Spirits,'' an adaptation of a book
of the same title by Isabelle Allende. The Warner Bros. project
will be filmed in Argentina in English.
   ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' which drew $1.3 million at the box
office, may sound depressing but August's scriptprises. His work is
showcased in a backdrop of the grand Danish countryside.
   Thirty-one countries submitted entries for consideration in this
year's Acadds. Selection of each nation's entry is made by ry
composed of filmmakers from that country and which need not be
released in the United States, is accepted.

   The Benevolent and Loyal Order Of
Pessimists is canceling its annual conventions.
   ``We've had enough. Traditions require too much optimism,'' said
BLOOP President Jack Duvall.
   The group has met in the Iowa City area once a year since 1975
on a weekend closest to April 15.
   ``Not only is that income tax day, it's also the anniversary of
the sinking of the Titanic. That's kind of a monument to optimism.
You recall it was the ship that couldn't be sunk,'' said Duvall.
   Duvall, which is not his real name, said he doesn't want to
divulge his identity or background because ``as a pessimist you
always worry about losing your job.''
   The conventions usually drew about 50 members who met to ``eat
and drink'' and read messages and letters from chapter members
unable to attend.
   They also awarded a ``Pessimist of the Year'' trophy.
   ``Until a couple of years ago we gave away a really nice trophy
in the shape of the rear end of a horse. It was really quite
coveted,'' he said.
   Duvall said another chapter, possibly on the West Coast, might
want to host future conventions.
   But Mike Grais, spokesman for the Los Angeles chapter, said
nothing doing.
   ``We're too depressed about their decision to do anything about
it,'' he said.

   Hey, yogurt here. Get yer yogurt here.
   Fans who attend San Francisco Giants ballgames at Candlestick
Park this season may be shocked to discover their stadium has gone
yuppie.
   Concession choices will no longer be limited to standard
ballpark fast-food fare, such as fat-filled hot dogs, salty peanuts
and beer.
   Instead, Giants' fans can now choose among the following healthy
foods: meatless hot dogs, yogurt, salads and all the mineral water
you can drink.
   The team is attempting to change Candlestick Park's image as a
crummy place to watch a game.
   ``Taken individually, these changes may seem cosmetic,'' said
team spokesman Duffy Jennings. ``But together they are part of our
overall goal to give people a different perception of what
attending a game at Candlestick Park is all about.''
   The health food will be available at a new Candlestick Park
concession stand appropriately called the ``Health Nut.'' And the
changes will not be limited to food.
   All the restrooms, including the men's rooms, will be equipped
with diaper-changing tables.

   Dustin Hoffman collected Hollywood's highest
honor for his portrayal of an autistic savant in ``Rain Man,'' but
his thoughts were with his 81-year-old father, Harry, who recently
suffered a stroke.
   ``My father so wanted to be here tonight,'' Hoffman said
Wednesday night after receiving the best actor Oscar. ``Ironically,
a few weeks ago, he joined the family of the disabled. ...''
   Hoffman added backstage: ``My father's doing fine, they are
optimistic.''
   A six-time nominee for best actor, Hoffman had last won an
Academy Award in 1979 for his role in ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''
   For his role as Raymond Babbitt in ``Rain Man,'' Hoffman visited
autistic savants, their families and medical experts, enabling him
to create the paradox of an autistic man who displays flashes of
mathematical genius.
   ``I just want to thank all the people I talked to that were
autistic and their families, and the doctors and all their help,''
Hoffman said.

   Best actress Jodie Foster, who won the Oscar
for her portrayal of a waitress gang raped in a tavern in ``The
Accused,'' said the movie shows that cruelty may be human and
cultural but is unacceptable.
   ``I'm very proud of the movie,'' she said backstage at the
Academy Awards. ``The movie is true and it's honest. It takes the
truth and it smacks it in your face.''
   Miss Foster, 26, noted that she is in her 24th year in the film
industry. She was previously nominated for an Oscar, in the
supporting actress category, at age 13 for her role as a prostitute
in ``Taxi Driver.''

   Three admitted drug dealers were convicted in
the murder of a rookie policeman whose death gained national
prominence in last year's presidential election and led to a major
drive against drug traffickers.
   Scott Cobb, 25, Todd Scott, 20, and Philip Copeland, 23, were
found guilty of second-degree murder and weapons charges Wednesday
evening after two days of jury deliberations.
   All three verdicts were met in the crowded courtroom by cheers
and applause from police officers and friends and family of slain
Officer Edward Byrne.
   Speaking to reporters afterward, Matthew Byrne said his son's
murder was ``meant to send a message to society'' about the power
of the drug dealers. The guilty verdicts, he said, send ``a message
from society ... don't kill cops.''
   Prosecutors said Byrne was killed early in the morning of Feb.
26, 1988, on orders from Howard ``Pappy'' Mason, a jailed drug lord
who was seeking revenge for his weapons conviction earlier that
week.
   Byrne was shot five times in the head at close range as he sat
alone in a patrol car guarding the home of a witness in a drug case
in the borough of Queens.
   In the wake of the slaying, police established the Tactical
Narcotics Team, which put a heavy police presence in the area. The
program has since been extended to other drug-plagued neighborhoods
and has resulted in thousands of arrests.
   Byrne's slaying also gained national attention during last
year's presidential election when the officer's father presented
his son's shield to then Vice President George Bush at a rally.
   The elder Byrne supported Bush's pro-death penalty stance. New
York state does not have the death penalty.
   The defendants each face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life
on the murder charges and five to 15 years on the second-degree
criminal possession of a weapon convictions.
   A fourth defendant, David McClary, is to be tried later.
   Lawyers for the three convicted Wednesday promised appeals.

<TEXT>
   A new security zone in the waters
off President Bush's summer home is drawing fire from lobstermen,
who object to changing their fishing routines for their famous
neighbor.
   ``It would be a faux pas to say, `You poor fishermen can't
fish.' Basically, what they're saying is you can fish there if you
can withstand the grief,'' lobsterman Jim Nadeau said Wednesday
night after the Coast Guard announced lobster boats would be
boarded and searched for bombs and terrorists before they can come
within 500 yards of Bush's home.
   ``If I don't fish in there, that one particular area will
probably cost me $500 or $600 or $700 a week,'' said Nadeau, who
will keep working around the Bush home at Walker's Point.
   Bush has said in the past he does not want to disrupt the
lobstering done around his home by about three dozen fishermen. But
lobstermen said the Bush entourage has caused problems since he was
vice president.
   Lobstermen complain that Coast Guard cutters on security patrols
have slashed the buoy lines on their lobster pots, costing them
hundreds of dollars as the traps and lobsters are lost.
   Coast Guard Capt. R.W. ``Bud'' Breault Jr. acknowledged that
more lobster traps will be destroyed with the new security zone,
and it may be difficult for the lobstermen to prove who did it if
they try to file a claim.
   ``This will have an impact on you and probably your lobster
pots,'' Breault told the angry lobstermen in a special meeting.
   Some lobstermen said they will refuse to work the waters off
Bush's property because they don't want government officials
boarding their boats.
   ``None of us wants to be boarded on a regular basis,'' said
lobsterman Knoep Nieuwkerk, who plans to stay away. ``Nobody wants
to be boarded. Do you want police checking your car every day?''
   Coast Guard boats have cut lobster pot buoy lines because they
are not equipped with ``cages'' that prevent propellers from
slashing the lines, the lobstermen said. The Coast Guard said
Wednesday night it will install nozzles that wrap around the
propellers on some of its smaller boats, but not on the large
cutters that will roam the safety zone and a larger area extending
another 500 to 1,000 yards farther out to sea.

<HEAD>Jodie Foster Wins Best Actress Oscar for `The Accused'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Oscars, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jodie Foster, who had the thrill and
disappointment of an unsuccessful Academy Award nomination 13 years
ago, won the best actress Oscar Wednesday night for her portrayal
of a rape victim in ``The Accused.''
   ``This is such a big deal and my life is so simple,'' the
ebullient 26-year-old actress told the Shrine Auditorium audience
as she clutched the glistening trophy.
   ``There are very few things _ there is love and work and family
_ and this movie was so special to us because it was all three of
those things,'' she said.
   In ``The Accused,'' Miss Foster played Sarah Tobias, a brassy
waitress who is raped by a gang in a tavern's back room.
   She reflected on the film in a touching tribute to her mother,
Brandy, ``who taught me that all of my fingerpaintings were
Picassos and that I didn't have to be afraid, and mostly that
cruelty might be very human and it might be very cultural but it's
not acceptable, which is what this movie is about.''
   Miss Foster was previously nominated for an Oscar, in the
supporting actress category, at age 12 for her role as a prostitute
in ``Taxi Driver.''
   The best actress Oscar may focus attention on her maturity as an
actress rather than the notoriety stemming from the attempted
assassination of President Reagan by John Hinckley.
   The mentally-disturbed drifter was trying to impress Miss Foster
because of a fixation he developed after seeing ``Taxi Driver'' 14
times.
   Before coming backstage to address the press following her Oscar
win, a representative of the Academy admonished reporters not to
question the actress about the Hinckley affair.
   ``This is like winning the lottery or something,'' Miss Foster
said backstage. ``This is my 24th year in the film industry and
it's probably the longest I've spent anywhere. ... I'm very proud
of the movie. The movie is true and it's honest. It takes the truth
and it smacks it in your face.''
   Her growth as an actress was illustrated by the competition she
faced for the award: Glenn Close in ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' Meryl
Streep in ``A Cry in the Dark,'' Sigourney Weaver in ``Gorillas in
the Mist'' and Melanie Griffith in ``Working Girl.''

   In true Hollywood style, a quiet film about
the disconnected soul of an autistic ``Rain Man'' won Oscars for
best picture, best original screenplay, best director Barry
Levinson and best actor Dustin Hoffman.
   ``It is for us a Cinderella story. The picture was literally
canceled three or four times,'' Hoffman said backstage at Wednesday
night's 61st Academy Awards.
   It also had a much-rewritten screenplay and went through four
directors over two years.
   Jodie Foster, a former child star, won the best actress award
and her first Oscar for her emotional portrayal of the angry,
traumatized victim of a gang rape in ``The Accused.''
   ``Cruelty might be human and it might be cultural, but it's not
acceptable, and that's what this movie is about,'' said Miss
Foster, 26, who was nominated for the award in 1976 at age 13 for
playing a child prostitute in ``Taxi Driver.
   Her dark-horse victory was over the more favored actresses Glenn
Close, in ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' and Melanie Griffith's ``Working
Girl.'' Sigourney Weaver, nominated for best actress and best
supporting actress, won neither.
   ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' a saga of sexual gamesmanship and deceit
among the wealthy in pre-Revolutionary France, won three Oscars _
for art direction, costumes and adapted screenplay, given to writer
Christopher Hampton.
   ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' the inventive comic blend of
animation and live action, won three technical Oscars _ visual
effects, film editing and sound effects editing _ and a special
award for its chief animator, Richard Williams.
   Geena Davis, who played a bubbly, eccentric dog trainer in ``The
Accidental Tourist,'' and Kevin Kline, the pseudo-intellectual,
goldfish-devouring jewel thief in ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' won in
supporting roles.
   Denmark won best foreign language film for the second straight
year with writer-director Bille August's ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' a
grim picture of farm life in Denmark early in the century. The 1988
winner was ``Babette's Feast.''
   Best song was Carly Simon's ``Let the River Run'' from ``Working
Girl.'' The movie, Miss Simon said, ``inspired me to write a hymn
to the morning. New York is a jungle, but I still wrote a hymn.''
   The academy could find only three songs to nominate this year,
instead of the usual five, and didn't see fit to have them
performed during the show.
   Instead, producer Allan Carr said the show's opening number
would be the most exciting 15 minutes in television history.
Instead, the man who put ``La Cage aux Folles'' on Broadway gave
the world a Snow White lookalike trilling ``Proud Mary'' to
Hollywood brat packer Rob Lowe.
   The night belonged to the ``Rain Man'' himself.
   ``I'm supposed to be jaded at this point; I'm very honored,''
Hoffman, 51, said in a halting, emotional voice after a rare
standing ovation from the Shrine Auditorium audience. He won the
award in 1979 for ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''
   Backstage, he acknowledged the difficulty of creating Raymond
Babbit, a ``high-functional'' autistic who can perform genius-level
feats of calculation and visualization, but is unable to connect
with other human beings, including a scheming younger brother who
covets Raymond's $3 million legacy.
   ``I'm hanging on by a fingernail,'' he once told Levinson.
   Levinson, in accepting the director's award, said the movie's
success was ``really about two actors _ Dustin Hoffman and Tom
Cruise. If they didn't deliver the performances they gave, I
wouldn't be up here this evening.''
   ``Rain Man'' entered the awards ceremony with eight nominations,
more than any other title, and has grossed $134.6 million at the
box office.
   ``Rain Man'' lost the original score award to ``The Milagro
Beanfield War'' (Dave Grusin) and art direction to ``Dangerous
Liaisons.''
   Miss Davis was the first to receive an award with the line ``And
the Oscar goes to ...'' The Academy, dropping the traditional ``And
the winner is ...'' intended to soften the sense of competition,
but several presenters, including Cher for best picture, reverted
to ``The winner is...''
   ``First of all, I want to thank Anne Tyler for writing such a
wonderful book,'' said Miss Davis after receiving her award. She
has remarked that she had read Miss Tyler's novel when it was first
published and coveted the role of Muriel, later realizing her dream.
   ``It's great getting an Oscar for a comedy. It doesn't usually
happen,'' Kline said backstage.

   Six black activists left the
British Embassy today, a day after encamping there to protest
police restrictions on their activities. An escaped detaineee
remained in the U.S. Consulate.
   Almost as soon as the six activists arrived at the British
Embassy in Pretoria on Wednesday, British officials made clear they
disapproved of the protest and asked that the group leave.
   The activists left today after having requested Britain to
pressure the South African government to lift all restrictions on
them and other former detainees. Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said
the five men and one woman would not be arrested.
   The embassy said the six would be able to make an effective
protest to the government only if they ended their sit-in, and ``we
therefore welcome their decision to leave.''
   Anti-apartheid groups had complained about the embassy's refusal
to allow the six to use telephones and toilets in the building.
   The National Union of Mineworkers, a militantly anti-apartheid
black union, described Britain's stance toward the activists as
``shocking and inhuman.''
   ``Denying them facilities necessary for human habitation
confirms out long-held views that apartheid repression is fully
supported by the British government for the realization of super
profits accruing from their sanction-busting companies in South
Africa,'' the union said in a statement.
   Simon Ntombela, 27, was in the U.S. Consulate in a downtown
Johannesburg office building, after escaping in his pajamas
Wednesday from a hospital in Durban, 360 miles away. Ntombela
reportedly took a commercial flight to Johannesburg.
   The Human Rights Commission, a private group, said Ntombela was
seeking the end of his detention, without restrictions, and
unconditional freedom for all other detainees. The commission said
Ntombela ended a hunger strike Wednesday.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok was scheduled to meet
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other anti-apartheid clergymen
today to discuss the fate of scores of activists still detained
under an emergency declared nearly three years ago to control
uprisings in black communities.
   Botha said Wednesday that the six would not be arrested if they
left the embassy, although some had violated their restrictions.
One of the six, labor official Donsie Khumalo, is barred from
political activities, confined to his home at night and must report
to a police station twice daily.
   Botha said Ntombela's case was being studied and a decision
would be made about his possible release.
   Ntombela was the eighth detainee to escape from a hospital since
September. Three who took refuge in the U.S. Consulate in
Johannesburg and four who reached the West German Embassy in
Pretoria were later allowed by the government to go free.
   An estimated 600 activists have gone on hunger strikes this year
to protest their detention without trial.
   The government announced Wednesday that it would now place
hunger strikers in prison or in hospitals in Bloemfontein, a
relatively remote provincial center, to prevent escapes and
publicity about them.
   Authorities have freed most detainees since the fasts began but
has placed severe restrictions on their activities. Human rights
sources say several hundred remain in detention, including more
than 30 on hunger strikes.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varying
periods under the emergency declared in June 1986.
   Under apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   A 28-year-old woman was justified in locking her
husband out of their apartment because he smelled, a judge ruled.
   ``There is no reason why the wife should be subjected to the
extremely uncomfortable situation,'' acting state Supreme Court
Justice Walter Schackman said in ruling this week.
   Jennifer Sheppard changed the locks on the couple's Manhattan
studio apartment Oct. 31 and told her husband, Darnay Hoffman, 41,
to stay away. She put his belongings in storage and filed for
divorce.
   In granting Sheppard sole possession of the apartment, Schackman
noted her contention that Hoffman had stopped washing his upper
body and wore the same clothes for weeks.
   Hoffman said the charges were untrue. ``I wasn't in the
apartment long enough to smell it up,'' he said.
   He said his wife was the source of the smell.
   Sheppard had no comment.

<HEAD>Study Says Competing Heart Attack Drugs Equally Effective</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A heart attack drug developed through genetic
engineering appears to be no better than an older medicine that is
much cheaper, scientists reported today.
   The study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the
older drug streptokinase is just as good as TPA, or tissue
plasminogen activator, at preserving the heart after a heart attack.
   ``Because the allocation of scarce health resources is a cause
of concern,'' the report concluded, ``the lower cost of
streptokinase is an important factor in its favor.''
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Elliot Rapaport said one
treatment of streptokinase costs $78 at San Francisco General
Hospital, while TPA costs $2,268.
   Earlier research showed that both drugs break up clots that
block the heart arteries, and both can significantly reduce the
chances of death if given quickly after a heart attack. However,
many experts assumed that the newer drug, TPA, was better.
   Several studies have examined the merits of the two treatments.
The authors of the latest work said theirs is the first to compare
them head-to-head in people treated during the first three hours of
heart attacks, the period during which medicines have the best
chance of saving the heart.
   The report concluded that the health of the left ventricle, the
main pumping chamber of the heart, was the same regardless of which
medicine the patients got.
   The study was conducted by Dr. Harvey D. White and colleagues
from Green Lane Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. It involved 270
heart attack patients who were ramdomly assigned to receive one of
the two medicines.
   After nine months, 6 percent of the TPA patients and 9 percent
of the streptokinase patients had died. However, the researchers
said the number of people treated was too small to determine
whether there is a true difference in the death rate.

   Police tightened security for the
225,000-strong Islamic community today after the slaying of a
Moslem leader who criticized Iran's call to kill author Salman
Rushdie.
   Gunmen killed Imam Abdullah Ahdal, the Saudi leader of Moslems
in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, in an attack Wednesday
at Ahdal's office in the Islamic Cultural Center.
   ``Because of the attack, protective measures for members of the
Islamic community were increased immediately,'' Interior Minister
Louis Tobback in a statement.
   He said police will start ``preventive patrols'' in Moslem
neighborhoods ``aimed at restoring the peace of mind within this
community.''
   Separately, police said they have reinforced security checks at
the borders and airports.
   Police said Ahdal, 36, and librarian Salem Behir, a 40-year-old
Tunisian, were shot at close range.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
and police said there were no witnesses. Unconfirmed reports said
three hooded men were seen jumping from a van, entering the mosque
and then fleeing.
   In London, a senior Moslem cleric today blamed the murders on
jealousy between Moslems after Belgian authorities designated the
Brussels mosque where the slayings took place as the official
mosque in Belgium.
   ``That creates a lot of jealousies and resentments,'' Zaki
Badawi, president of the United Kingdom Council of Imams and
Mosques, said in a telephone interview. The organization is one of
about a dozen separate Moslem religious bodies in Britain.
   Ahdal, an imam or preacher, had been in Brussels for six years
heading the Moslem community in Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg.
   Behir, who headed the mosque's social services and library,
lived in the city for about 10 years.
   Ahdal's center, in a park near the European Economic Community
headquarters, is sponsored by the Mecca, Saudi Arabia-based Moslem
World League, which was set up by the late Saudi ruler King Faisal
to unite Moslems.
   On Feb. 14, Iran's fundamentalist patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini called on Moslems to kill Rushdie, a naturalized Briton,
for his novel ``The Satanic Verses''. Many Moslems consider the
book blasphemous.
   In a television interview Feb. 20, the day the 12 European
Economic Community countries recalled their ambassadors from Iran
in response to the death decree, Ahdal said he agreed Rushdie's
book was blasphemous.
   But he said of Khomeini's death sentence: ``One should not have
done that. Rushdie should have first appeared (before an Islamic
tribunal). He should have explained himself, defended himself. He
should have been asked to repent.''
   In democratic societies ``everyone has the right to speak his
thoughts, to express himself as he wants,'' Ahdal told RTBF,
Belgium's French-language television network.
   Claude van Engeland, an RTBF reporter, said Wednesday the
network received angry phone calls after the interview from callers
who claimed Ahdal, who spoke in Arabic, was improperly translated.
   After the killings, police cordoned off the building.
   At one point a woman wearing a black veil emerged from the
building and threatened a reporter with a handgun. Several police
officers struggled with the woman and wrested the gun from her.
They said later she was Ahdal's widow.
   Rushdie, born in India to a Moslem, is in hiding in Britain.
   Moslems are deeply offended by ``The Satanic Verses'' because of
a brothel scene in which prostitutes take the names of the Prophet
Mohammed's wives and because the novel suggests Mohammed wrote the
holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.

   The main Iranian opposition group claims
the country's newly ousted U.N. ambassador was jailed on orders
from fundamentalist patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Iran
denied the claim.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq (Holy Warriors) said in a telex sent
Wednesday from its headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq that the envoy,
Mohammad Jaafar Mahallati, was arrested after returning from New
York.
   ``It was only a short period after his arrest that the Khomeini
regime announced his resignation on the false excuse of illness and
doctors' recommendations,'' the statement said. It could not be
independently confirmed.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, later denied that Mahallati had been arrested.
   The agency quoted an unidentified foreign ministry source as
saying the report was ``quite baseless.''
   Mahallati's resignation was announced Tuesday by IRNA, hours
before Khomeini's designated successor was ousted in an apparent
crackdown on moderates in the administration.
   Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, 64, was dumped after voicing
open criticism in recent weeks of the 10-year-old Islamic
revolution's shortcomings, and calling for greater freedoms.
   He was named in 1985 as successor to Khomeini, now 88 and
ailing, but had fallen into disfavor for his liberal views and
growing alignment with former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan.
   Bazargan, the revolutionary government's first prime minister,
heads a token opposition grouping known as the Freedom Movement.
   The first indications of a shakeup in the Iranian leadershp came
Sunday when the resignation of Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad
Javad Larijani was announced.
   Mahallati and Larijani, both American-educated, had worked to
improve relations with Western nations after the U.N-sponsored
cease-fire last August in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   Together with Montazeri, they appeared to be casualties of a
resurgence of radical fundamentalism in Iran following Khomeini's
harsh attack last month on rebuilding ties with the West.
   The two diplomats belonged to the so-called pragmatist camp led
by the powerful Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, which also
includes the foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati.
   Rafsanjani and his supporters have argued that opening up to the
West was essential for reconstructing the economy in the post-war
period.
   But Khomeini denounced attempts to liberalize Iran, citing
British author Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' as
proof Western nations were trying to undermine Islam.
   On Feb. 14, Khomeini ordered Moslems to seek out and kill
Rushdie, who was born to a Moslem family in India, for allegedly
blaspheming Islam with the book.
   Last week, he said Iran had drifted away from the values of its
1979 revolution whose aim, he asserted, was still ``the creation of
a global Islamic government.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Death Toll at 29</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 29 people have died and 127
have been injured in ethnic riots in a southern province, and some
victims bled to death because fierce fighting prevented them from
reaching hospitals, news reports said today.
   The death toll reported by the Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti
was four higher than that given by officials. An unofficial emigre
group put the death count at 137.
   An official newspaper suggested the higher numbers were aimed at
fomenting more unrest in the province of Kosovo.
   Marija Gasi, a spokeswoman for Kosovo's government information
office, told reporters today 23 people had died and 92
demonstrators and 121 policemen had been injured.
   Vecernje Novosti cited ``the latest available information'' for
the report from Pristina, the provincial capital. Reliable sources
in Pristina said they had heard the same death toll from police.
   Vecernje Novosti said two policemen and 27 demonstrators died in
clashes Monday and Tuesday between security forces and ethnic
Albanians. It said 97 demonstrators and 30 policemen were injured
in the bloodshed, which was sparked by a decision to give the
republic of Serbia more control over Kosovo, its autonomous
province.
   Serbs contend the constitutional changes, which took effect
Tuesday, are needed to protect Kosovo's mainly Christian Slav
minority from the mainly Moslem ethnic Albanians, who make up 85
percent of the 1.9 million population.
   Ethnic Albanians say the changes threaten autonomy won under
Yugoslavia's 1974 constitution.
   Vecernje Novosti said seven Kosovo settlements dominated by the
province's Slav minority had set up patrols and posted guards
around the settlements.
   Another Belgrade daily, Borba, said a policeman who died in
Titova Mitrovica on Monday after being shot did not die immediately
but bled to death because intense rioting delayed his transfer to a
hospital.
   Other media accounts said another wounded police officer had to
wait an hour before getting to a hospital because of the fighting
and died shortly afterward.
   Borba, a Communist Party daily, indicated some of the worst
violence occurred in the village of Zur, near the border with
Albania. It said protesters there used ``bombs'' in the clashes.
Some of the bombs exploded prematurely and injured several
demonstrators, it said.
   Borba also said five policemen caught between demonstrators in
the village of Dusanovo had to be rescued by helicopters.
   The entire province was under a nighttime curfew.
   The Slovene Communist party daily Delo took the unusual step of
publishing on its front page today what it said were casualty
figures from an emigre Albanian group in Brussels. Those figures
listed 137 dead and 370 injured.
   Yugoslav authorities have said ethnic Albanian emigre groups
foment unrest in Kosovo and exaggerate casualty figures.
   Police refused comment on the reports of higher death tolls, and
Borba suggested the numbers were intended to instigate further
unrest.
   ``The enemy is trying everything to incite the revolt of the
ethnic Albanian population,'' it said. ``To this end, they are
using in particular disinformation about the number of killed
demonstrators.''

   Bernard Blier, the plump and balding French actor
who incarnated hapless husbands, conniving cops and heartless
hitmen over a movie career that spanned 60 years, has died, his son
announced today. He was 73.
   Blier made more than 150 movies including Yves Allegret's
``Maneges'' (1949) and ``Buffet Froid'' (1979), directed by his son
Bertrand and starring Gerard Depardieu.
   Bertrand Blier said his father died Wednesday night after a long
illness. He did not elaborate.
   Culture Minister Jack Lang said French cinema had lost ``one of
its greatest and most popular artists.''
   Earlier this month, Blier received a special Cesar award, the
equivalent of an American Oscar, honoring his life's work. He
appeared thin and weak as he edged slowly across the stage to take
the golden statue from fellow actor Michel Serrault, who was so
moved he forgot his lines and improvised a poignant presentation.
   Blier was born on Jan. 11, 1916, in Buenos Aires, Argentina
where his father, a biologist, was on assignment for the Pasteur
Institute. He studied drama with stage actor Louis Jouvet, who
reportedly told him he would have a brilliant career starting at
age 50.
   From his first film in 1937, Raymond Rouleau's ``Trois, Six,
Neuf,'' (Three, Six, Nine,) followed by six other movies that same
year, Blier was a workaholic. His last role was in Moshe Misrahi's
``Mangeclous'' in 1988.
   ``My work is my `joie de vivre,''' Blier once said. ``Never do I
go to the studio like one goes to the office.''

<TEXT>
   Five casinos accused of giving VIP
treatment to a teen-ager have agreed to pay penalties of up to
$100,000 for allowing a minor to gamble.
   The state Casino Control Commission will meet next week to
actually set the fines, which were proposed in an agreement
announced Wednesday between the casinos and the state Division of
Gaming Enforcement.
   The casinos were charged with treating 17-year-old Debra Kim
Cohen as a high roller even though she was under the legal gambling
age of 21.
   Miss Cohen lost thousands of dollars playing blackjack and was
offered free rooms, drinks, limousine rides, shows and meals by the
casinos.
   Leonard Cohen tried to stop his daughter's compulsive gambling
by sending the casinos letters and photographs of her and warning
security guards to turn her away. In some cases, Miss Cohen
continued on as a preferred customer.
   The proposed penalties were: Caesars, $100,000; Resorts
International, $21,762; Harrah's Marina, $36,387; Trump Plaza,
$7,287, and Elsinore's Atlantis, $14,562.
   Gaming regulators had rejected the casinos' initial proposal to
make donations to medical facilities instead.
   ``Although it sounds like a lot of money, it's a slap on the
wrist to these industry giants,'' the teen-ager's father said.
``It's like paying a parking ticket.''
   He advocated legislation to tighten penalties against casinos
that allow underage gambling.
   Last year, Miss Cohen pleaded guilty to underage gambling and
was ordered to attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings.
   If the fine set by the casino commission is less than the
proposed penalties, the gaming halls will donate the difference to
treatment centers for compulsive gamblers, said Assistant Attorney
General Mitchel Schwefel.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways promised today to punish those
responsible for letting a jumbo jet fly with explosives left on
board by a bomb-detection team during a drill.
   The incident sparked a new controversy over airline security
after the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   A cleaning worker found the gelignite, which officials said
could flare up but not explode, aboard the Boeing 747 on Monday at
London's Heathrow Airport, said Independent Television News, which
broke the story Wednesday night.
   The flight had just returned from a flight to Toronto.
   Police confirmed the incident, saying one of their
bomb-detection teams inadvertently left the explosives on board
after using the aircraft in an exercise to train sniffer dogs.
   The Department of Transport said today it has called for an
urgent report. British Airways chairman Lord King promised ``a most
thorough and detailed investigation,'' saying: ``If heads fall,
they fall.''
   An airline spokesman, Derek Ross, said cleaners found the
substance under a seat at the rear of the plane. ITN news said it
was left there for about two weeks, during which the Boeing 747
made several journeys.
   Today, airport sources said it was believed the package was
placed in a seat pocket and then slipped through into the
upholstery.
   The latest controversy follows widespread charges that Tranpsort
Secretary Paul Channon was lax about sending airlines warnings
about a new type of radio cassette bomb before the Pan Am Flight
103 disaster on Dec. 21 that killed 270 people.
   Flight 103, which originated in Frankfurt, was blown up over
Lockerbie, Scotland, after taking off from Heathrow. Authorities
believe a bomb was encased in a radio-cassette player.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has defended Channon, but
speculation remains that she will drop him from the Cabinet later
this year.
   Scotland Yard said police use British Airways planes for
explosive-search training from time to time.
   Police Inspector Andrew Nielson said the explosive weighed less
than a pound and measured about 4 inches by .8 inch.
   He said the substance was incapable of exploding by itself and
``at the very worst it could flare up if ignited by fire. Nobody at
any time has been placed in any danger.''
   But lawmaker David Wilshire, a member of the governing
Conservative Party and whose constituency includes the airport,
said British Airways was responsible for the incident.
   ``I'd say to BA ... there's evidence growing by the week that
you aren't carrying out your responsibility properly,'' Wilshire
said in a radio interview. ``The buck stops with BA on this
occasion.''
   ITN last week showed videotape taken by three youths who said
they boarded an empty British Airways jumbo jet at Heathrow on
March 20 without being challenged. The video included a shot of one
youth sitting in the captain's seat.
   British Airways said it regarded the incident as ``extremely
serious,'' but stressed it took place in a maintenance area and not
the operational area.
   The opposition Labor Party's spokesman for transport, John
Prescott, called for a new supervisory security body at Heathrow
and accused the police of sloppiness. ``It's a breakdown yet again
of simple procedures,'' he said.

   Moslem guerrillas appear to be
increasing operations closer to the capital after failing to
dislodge government forces from the eastern city of Jalalabad,
sources said today.
   One report reaching Kabul said government troops and tanks came
under heavy fire Wednesday along the Salang Highway about 45 miles
north of the city. Kabul itself has been generally quiet.
   In Pakistan, the guerrillas claimed to have captured a military
post west of Jalalabad, effectively blocking the road between that
city and Kabul. They also claimed to have killed at least 147
government troops in fighting this week.
   A foreign official in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said an Afghan civilian reported ``serious fighting'' and destroyed
tanks along the Salang Highway, north of Kabul. There was no word
on casualties.
   Government troops a few miles outside Kabul have been firing
rockets west and northwest of the city since Tuesday. The number of
long-range Scud-B missiles fired from Kabul toward Jalalabad also
has increased.
   Western reporters and foreign residents of the capital counted
at least 13 fired Wednesday, and at least four more were launched
in a 10-minute period early today.
   The Soviet-supplied missiles can easily reach Jalalabad, 75
miles away.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas began their attack on Jalalabad on
March 6. It was their first major offensive against government
forces since Soviet troops completed their withdrawal Feb. 15,
ending nine years of direct combat support for the Kabul government.
   Jalalabad's fall would be a major blow to the morale of the
government and a big boost to the rebels. Western observers have
predicted a domino effect, ending with Kabul.
   Evidence of guerrilla activity near Kabul also surfaced when a
U.N. convoy carrying seeds and fertilizer was caught in cross-fire
for about six hours Sunday just beyond Kabul's northwestern
outskirts.
   A U.N. official said the shooting began when guerrillas opened
fire on people distributing seeds. He said the U.N workers were not
hurt.
   The government says its troops are still in control of
Jalalabad. According to its casualty reports, the guerrillas have
suffered about 10 times more fatalities than government troops.
   Claims by both sides tend to be exaggerated and cannot usually
be confirmed.
   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said 147 government troops
were killed this week. It said at least 114 were killed or wounded
since Tuesday around Jalalabad.
   The agency also said guerrilla commanders rejected Afghan
President Najib's appeal for them to give up their war in exchange
for local autonomy. Najib made the appeal Tuesday.
   ``If Najib wants to stop the bloodshed, this is the best
opportunity for him to quit (his) office and recognize the interim
Islamic government,'' the agency said.
   Also today, an explosion blew out the windows of a four-story
building in the heart of Kabul's commercial district.
   An official of the government press office said the blast was
caused by a bomb ``planted by the extremists'' and that two people
were injured.
   But a policeman at the scene, who did not give his name, told
foreign journalists a canister of gas used for cooking or heating
blew up.

<HEAD>Premier Files For Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou today filed for
divorce from his American-born wife Margaret, the government
announced.
   A petition for the divorce was filed by Papandreou's lawyer
Athanasios Liapis before an Athens court and will be discussed on
June 5, said government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos.
   The premier had announced in October that he would seek an end
to his 37-year marriage to the former Margaret Chant of Elmhurst,
Ill.
   Mrs. Papandreou, 66, who has been accused of delaying divorce
proceedings, has said she was still waiting to see her husband to
discuss details of their divorce.
   Papandreou, 70, left his wife to live with his 34-year-old
girlfriend, former Olympic Airways stewardess, Dimitra Liani, in
October when he returned from London where he had undergone
open-heart surgery.
   The open relationship has offended some of the Socialist
premier's supporters and Liani has been accused by the news media
of exerting her influence over government ministers and leading
Papandreou to neglect his health.
   The affair has played a major role in Papandreou's waning
popularity among voters, according to published public opinion
polls.
   The divorce could be issued in two months, shortly before the
scheduled June 18 elections, only if Mrs. Papandreou agrees to
grant it.
   If both parties don't agree, divorce proceedings could drag on
for more than two years before the court sanctions a divorce.

<HEAD>Nuke Plant Operators Fail Tests; Reactor Shut Down</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A utility turned off a nuclear reactor after nearly
half the control room operators who took a refresher exam flunked.
   Unit 3 at the Turkey Point nuclear plant was shut down Wednesday
following a meeting between Florida Power &amp;Light Co. and the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Utility spokeswoman Stacey Shaw insisted the NRC had not ordered
a shutdown. Agency spokesman Ken Clark agreed, but added, ``I don't
think we would have been satisfied with anything less.''
   The NRC has fined Turkey Point about $1 million over the last
five years for safety and security violations, identifying the
plant as one of the nation's 10 worst.
   Clark said at least three of six control-room crews and 11 of 24
individuals who took requalification exams earlier this month
failed all or part of the test, which is given to operators at
regular intervals.
   The plant has 52 control-room operators. Those who fail any part
of the test cannot work in the control room until re-certified,
Clark said. Workers take the exams individually and are also tested
on their ability work as a team.
   Ms. Shaw said the reactor will remain closed while the utility
demonstrates to the NRC that those running it are qualified. She
said the plant was to shut down later this week in any case for
routine maintenance.
   Ms. Shaw said only a couple of those who failed are actively
operating the plant's reactors. Many who flunked, she said, are no
longer working in the control rooms.
   Unit 3 was reduced to hot shutdown, allowing it to return on
line quickly if the NRC agrees. Unit 4, the other generator, was
out of operation for refueling.
   Clark said that NRC also is demanding that the utility present a
plan by May to solve training deficiencies.

   The mother of a stabbing victim removed
her son's life-support system today over the objections of the
assailant, who fears he will be charged with murder.
   Sylvia Lane said she withdrew her son Mark Weaver's feeding tube
at 12:01 a.m. before leaving for her job on the early morning shift
at a nursing home. A probate judge on Feb. 27 gave her permission
to do so beginning today.
   The feeding tube has kept her son alive nearly four years. Mrs.
Lane said doctors believe Weaver, 26, will die in a week or two.
   Only then will prosecutors say whether they will file a murder
charge against Noel Pagan, who served three years in prison for
aggravated assault on Weaver. A judge this week refused to allow
Pagan to intervene in the case.
   Doctors said Weaver has no prospect for recovery from a
``persistent vegetative state'' caused by stab wounds to the neck
that deprived his brain of oxygen.

<HEAD>Syrians Launch Attacks on Depot, Christian District; Two Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian-fired rockets hit a fuel depot in
Christian east Beirut today and triggered explosions that rocked
the city and shattered windows for miles around. Another Syrian
attack on a Christian neighborhood killed two people, police said.
   A police spokesman said 14 people suffered shrapnel and glass
shard wounds from the butane gas explosions after the attack on the
depot.
   Syrian gunners also fired two rockets into the city's Sin El-Fil
district this morning, said the spokesman, who cannot be named
under police regulations. Two people died there and three were
injured, he said.
   The casualties raised the overall toll to 125 people killed and
405 wounded since March 8 in fighting between Christians and
Moslems.
   The spokesman said more than 250,000 of Beirut's 1.2 million
residents have fled to southern Lebanon since the clashes erupted
between the Christian soldiers of Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian
forces backing militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party.
   The rockets struck tanks of butane cooking gas at the Dora
district depot, where fires sparked by earlier shelling already
have destroyed 60 percent of Lebanon's gasoline reserves and 60
percent of its diesel reserves.
   ``Butane is leaking from nearby tanks and exploding in balls of
fire in midair over Dora,'' a local reporter said by telephone.
   The police spokesman said the explosions smashed windows in a
three-mile radius.
   A senior oil ministry official, Raymond Roufaiel, said the fire
blazing uncontrolled in Dora had consumed $10 million worth of
gasoline and more than 3.5 million gallons of diesel oil.
   ``We can hardly manage to encircle the blaze and try to prevent
it from spreading to outside the tanks' region,'' said a Beirut
fire official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Moslem-Christian rift deepened six months ago when President
Amin Gemayel's term expired and Parliament was unable to agree on a
successor.
   Just before leaving office, Gemayel named Aoun, a Maronite
Catholic, leader of an interim military Cabinet.
   Moslems and Syria rejected the appointment because it violated
an unwritten national covenant that gave the premiership to the
Sunni Moslems, the presidency to the Maronites and the house
speakership to the Shiite Moslems.
   They pledged allegiance to Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who
seeks political reforms that will give the country's Moslems an
equal share of power with the traditionally dominant Christians.
   The latest violence round of began when Aoun clamped a blockade
March 6 on illegal militia-run ports, which deprive the government
of tax revenues and are used to bring in supplies for the war.
   Jumblatt retaliated by shelling Christian territory. The Syrians
later joined in the artillery duels across the 310-square mile area
where the country's Christians live.

   Twenty years after he left college one
credit short of graduation, Oscar-winning screenwriter Barry Morrow
has been offered a chance to earn his degree by submitting his
script for ``Rain Man.''
   Morrow and co-author Ronald Bass won at the Academy Awards
Wednesday night for original screenplay for ``Rain Man,'' the story
of an autistic man whose disability teaches his conniving brother
compassion.
   Morrow attended St. Olaf College in the late 1960s. He
transferred to the University of Hawaii for his junior year, then
returned to St. Olaf, but some credits were not transferred.
   All Morrow has to do is submit his script to St. Olaf's
speech-theater department, which will grade it and give him enough
credit to graduate, said Bob Englund, director of the college's
news services.
   ``There's always something perversely funny about coming one
short of graduating,'' Morrow said. But he said since he's turned
40, it's time to complete his ``unfinished business.''
   ``I didn't really matriculate until now as a professional
screenwriter, so it seems a good and fitting ceremony to celebrate
the success of `Rain Man,''' Morrow said.

<HEAD>Former U.S. Rep. Chappell Dies of Cancer</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of Pentagon investigation, Chappell's
denial of wrongdoing, his record in Congress. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Chappell, a 20-year Florida
congressman defeated for re-election last year amid reports linking
him to the Pentagon procurement scandal, died today after a battle
with bone cancer. He was 67.
   Chappell, a conservative Democrat from northeastern Florida's
4th District, died at the National Institutes of Health, where he
had been hospitalized Feb. 23.
   The former chairman of the powerful defense appropriations
subcommittee lost to Republican newcomer Craig James last fall by
791 votes out of about 250,000 cast. Chappell challenged the
outcome for a month before conceding.
   James' campaign emphasized reports linking Chappell to an
investigation of defense contractors and consultants who bribed
Pentagon employees for inside information useful in winning
contracts.
   No charges were filed against Chappell in the case, which has
resulted in a dozen guilty pleas.
   News reports said federal agents were investigating whether
Chappell received funds diverted from Unisys Corp. through Armtec
Inc., a small contractor in Chappell's district founded by retired
a Unisys executive.
   Chappell also came under scrutiny after news reports said two
men tied to defense contractor Martin Marietta intervened in a
foreclosure lawsuit against Chappell involving a racquet club he
owned.
   The congressman had dismissed the allegations as ``bunk'' and
``hogwash.''
   ``I think it is mainly political,'' he said during the campaign.
``In my position, I've stepped on some toes, primarily in the
Pentagon.''
   While in the House, Chappell was a strong proponent of a
balanced budget. He also fought to retain a manned-bomber force and
for a fifth nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and sponsored
legislation that created an assistant secretary of defense for
reserve affairs.
   Chappell was behind the creation of the 70,000-acre Cape
Canaveral National Seashore.
   Chappell was born in Kendrick and earned an undergraduate degree
and law degree from the University of Florida. He was a Navy
aviator in World War II and was in the Navy Reserve until 1983,
retiring as a captain.
   In addition to 10 terms in Congress, Chappell served in the
Florida House for 10 years and was its speaker in 1961. He was a
county prosecutor from 1949 to 1954.
   Survivors include his wife, Jeane; four children and two
stepchildren.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said today
he wants to travel to the United States later this year and to meet
Polish-born Pope John Paul II at the Vatican.
   An adviser said the trip to Italy probably will take place in
late April.
   ``I will thank him for always remembering about Solidarity and
our country, that thanks to his and our prayers Poland can have
such possibilities (for national accord) that it now has,'' Walesa
said.
   He made his comments while answering reporters' questions before
a meeting with the visiting Belgian prime minister, Wilfried
Martens, at the Belgium Embassy in Warsaw.
   Walesa said he hopes to go to the United States either in
September or November.
   An adviser to Walesa, the Rev. Henryk Jankowski at St. Brygida's
Church in Gdansk, said by telephone that the visit to the Vatican
tentatively is planned for the second half of April. He said he had
no other details immediately.
   Walesa last met with Pope John Paul in June 1987 during the
pontiff's most recent visit to his homeland. The pope, born Karol
Wojtyla, served as archbishop of Krakow before his pontificate
began in 1979.
   The Solidarity leader made his first foreign trip in seven years
in December when he went to Paris for a meeting of Nobel Peace
Prize laureates organized by French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Walesa had difficulty obtaining a passport to travel abroad
until late last year, when authorities agreed to enter into
negotiations with Solidarity again for the first time since the
1981 imposition of martial law.

   Iran said it ordered the Swiss consul in
Tehran expelled today, an apparent response to Switzerland's
insistence that Iran's consul in Geneva return home after being
accused of spying.
   Tehran Radio said Swiss ambassador Heinrich Reimann was summoned
to Iran's Foreign Ministry and told his consul, Jakob Schranz, had
one week to leave.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the ambassador was told
Schranz was an ``undesirable element,'' because he had been
involved in ``activities incompatible with his diplomatic status''
_ a term the normally implies spying.
   An operator who answered the telephone at the Swiss Embassy in
Tehran said there were no officials there to comment on the radio
report.
   The expulsion appeared to come in retaliation for Swiss pressure
on Iran's consul in Geneva, Manouchr Tale-Massouleh, to return
home. The Iranian diplomat left Wednesday for Tehran, according to
Iranian officials in Geneva.
   Swiss officials in Geneva said Iranian authorities had agreed to
have Tale-Massouleh leave after the diplomat was accused of spying.
   Josef Hermann, a spokesman for the Swiss federal prosecutor's
office, said Tale-Massouleh was not being expelled because an
accord had been reached on his departure.
   Hermann said Swiss authorities were conducting a criminal
investigation into two people suspected of helping the Iranian
diplomat gather information, but their nationalities or whereabouts
have not been disclosed.
   Questions about Tale-Massouleh's activities surfaced after the
Geneva consulate was occupied for five hours Dec. 14 by six Iranian
militants.
   The Iranians read what they said were confidential documents by
telephone to accomplices outside.
   At their trial in Geneva in January, they claimed the documents
showed Tale-Massouleh led efforts to spy on Iranian refugees in
Switzerland.
   Transcripts sent to Swiss authorities and media were dismissed
by the Iranian diplomat as forgeries.
   But Hermann said Swiss authorities verified ``certain points''
among the ``very voluminous'' documentation. He did not elaborate.
   The consulate occupiers, six men aged 25 to 41, all received
four-month suspended prison sentences. They said their action was a
protest against executions in Iran.
   The Geneva court threw out the prosecution's most serious charge
of hostage-taking. It said the accused deserved clemency because
their motive of ``drawing attention to the dramatic situation in
their country'' was honorable.
   In St. Gall, Switzerland, a Swiss publisher who planned to print
``The Satanic Verses'' in German received a death threat, prompting
police to provide him protection, authorities said today.
   Iranian clerics last month offered $5.2 million to any Moslem
who kills the novel's British author, Salman Rushdie, who has
remained in hiding since then. Many Moslems find the book
blasphemous.
   A St. Gall police spokesman said that after an anonymous
telephone threat against the publisher, Hans-Joerg Tobler,
``necessary measures were taken'' for his safety. The spokesman,
who declined to be identified, would not give further details.
   A spokeswoman for Tobler's company Panorama, based in Altstetten
near St. Gall, declined to say when the book was scheduled for
publication.
   News reports said Tobler was reconsidering whether to print the
book, but the spokeswoman said he was not available for comment.
   The novel includes passages in which prostitutes go by the names
of the prophet Mohammed's wives and which suggest Mohammed wrote
the holy Koran instead of Allah.

<HEAD>Soviet Students Get Long-Awaited Draft Deferment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beginning this spring, Soviet students can defer
their military service until after they have completed their
education, newspapers reported today.
   The Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda said that under
the new rules, students who go through officer training programs
can also expect to be ``essentially exempted'' from call-up for
peacetime service after they graduate.
   Previously, Soviet students were liable for call-up in the
middle of their studies. Under Soviet law, every able-bodied male
between the ages of 18 and 25 must serve at least two years in the
military.
   Changes in the draft system have been under discussion for the
last five years, said the Young Communist League newspaper
Komsmolskaya Pravda.
   There have been some calls for a complete end to the draft,
which is estimated to take 80 percent of the male population,
normally at age 18.
   ``Now it has become obvious to everyone that a two-to-three year
break in studies spent on soldiering leads to a serious lowering of
students' educational level,'' G.F. Kutzev, deputy head of the
State Education Committee, was quoted as saying.
   ``And the national defense capability itself depends to a great
extent on what kind of intellectual cadres we have, what kind of
specialists we prepare,'' he said.
   According to Kutzev, the system of officer training courses is
being reorganized.
   ``They will be canceled in some schools, added in others and
generally reoriented toward subjects with civilian applications.
   ``Knowledge received in officer training courses should
contribute toward the mastering of a civilian specialty and vice
versa,'' he said. ``After all, it's obvious that we need reserves
of highly qualified officers _ mathematicians, chemists,
electronics experts.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev plans to cut back the Soviet
armed forces by 500,000 troops as part of his strategy to devote
fewer resources to defense and more to the national economy.
   About 75 percent of Soviet military personnel are conscripts.

<HEAD>Democratic Missile Plan Comes Under GOP Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ranking Republican on the House Armed
Services Committee is calling on the Bush administration and his
GOP colleagues to reject a Democratic plan to overhaul the nation's
land-based missile force.
   Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama said the plan under which 50 MX
missiles would be moved from silos to a mobile rail garrison basing
mode is a ``bad deal'' because it would place unacceptable limits
on key defense programs.
   He said it would limit the number of 10-warhead MX missiles to
the 50 already fielded and start construction of 300 to 500 of the
smaller, Midgetman intercontinental ballistic missiles.
   It also would mean negative growth in the defense budget and
reduced funding for Star Wars and the stealth bomber programs as a
way of paying for the Midgetman.
   ``Unless the terms of this deal improve dramatically, I hope
that President Bush and (Defense) Secretary (Richard B.) Cheney
ignore it altogether,'' Dickinson said in a statement issued
Wednesday.
   ``The illusion of small ICBM inevitability that has been
cultivated by congressional Democrats in recent months is just that
_ illusion,'' he added.
   Democrats have favored the single-warhead Midgetman while former
President Reagan and many congressional Republicans have pushed for
the 10-warhead MX. As a member of the House, Cheney was an MX
supporter.
   Since taking over as defense secretary, however, Cheney has not
indicated if he would back a plan based on the MX, the Midgetman or
a combination of the two. National security adviser Brent Scowcroft
is an opponent of the MX.
   On Capitol Hill, support has been building among majority
Democrats for the plan to move the 50 existing MX missiles from
vulnerable silos to a rail garrison basing mode _ placing them on
railroad cars and moving them around the country _ and build a
Midgetman force of 300 to 500.
   Dickinson said, however, that the plan represented a variant of
previous efforts to reduce Pentagon spending.
   ``What we are seeing now on the small ICBM is the same
two-fisted attack on defense that we see from the liberals on the
defense bill every year,'' he said.

   Two Czechoslovak teen-agers who
hijacked a jetliner after shooting their way onto the aircraft in
Prague may face extradition, but the process could take months, an
official said today.
   Hungary's state-run MTI news agency reported that the Malev
airlines jet had returned to the capital, Budapest, along with its
four crew members and the Hungarian consul-general, Lajos Taba.
   Taba traded himself to the hijackers Wednesday to gain the
release of most of the passengers before the plane took off for
Frankfurt.
   MTI and the official Czechoslovak news agency CTK identified the
youths as Stefan Macicko, 17, and Dusan Styk, 16, both of Banska.
Frankfurt police did not release their names.
   Frankfurt prosecutor's spokesman Hubert Harth said he did not
know if the hijackers had requested political asylum in West
Germany. ``Our main concern is dealing with the criminal act of
hijacking,'' he said.
   Officials say the two initially wanted to go to the United
States but were foiled when the crew said the Soviet-made
Tupolev-154 could not make the trip over the Atlantic.
   The teen-agers, armed with a sawed-off shotgun, rifle and fake
hand grenade, commandeered the aircraft Wednesday in Prague. They
surrendered less than three hours later, and no one was injured in
the accident.
   Harth said in a telephone interview the hijackers may be
extradited to Czechoslovakia but that it would be a slow process.
   ``A decision on possible extradition would have to be made at
federal government level, and that won't come quickly. It could
take months.''
   Hans Neitzel, chief spokesman for the Frankfurt police
department, said officials did not know why the boys decided to
hijack the airliner.
   ``They said they wanted to go to America, but why they wanted to
go, whether they have relatives there or what, we don't know. Maybe
it was just youthful adventure,'' he said Wednesday night.
   Witnesses at Prague's Ruzyne Airport told The Associated Press
the hijackers seized a woman, crashed through a glass wall of the
VIP lounge, fired several shots and threatened a flight attendant
to gain access to the jet.
   About 100 people were on board the jet, which had arrived from
Budapest and was en route to Amsterdam. Taba traded himself for 82
passengers.

   The army sealed off the West Bank and
Gaza Strip today as Israeli Arabs joined Palestinians in a general
strike and flag-waving protests against Israeli occupation on a
bitter anniversary.
   Israeli troops shot and killed one Palestinian. Arab reports
listed 19 wounded in the West Bank, while the army listed four.
   Rallies in support of the Palestinian uprising went off
peacefully for the most part in northern Israel. But police
arrested 20 Arabs for possessing leaflets officials said could
incite violence.
   The strike by Arabs in Israel and the occupied lands
commemorates the March 30, 1976 deaths of six Israeli Arabs who
were shot by Israeli troops while protesting the government's
seizure of Arab land for an army firing range.
   Army reinforcements were called up in both the West Bank and
Gaza to prevent unrest on this anniversary known as Land Day.
Starting at midnight, the army banned Palestinians from entering
Israel for 24 hours.
   In the most extensive closure since November, the army imposed a
curfew in the Gaza Strip, confining all 650,000 residents to their
homes. Large areas of the West Bank were either under curfew or
closed to journalists who did not have an army escort.
   Outlawed black, red, white and green Palestinian flags fluttered
from electricity poles and rooftops throughout the West Bank.
   An army spokesman said a 20-year-old Palestinian carrying a
large stone was shot and killed in the village of Shweike near
Tulkarem as he was about to ambush an army officer in a narrow
alleyway.
   The army said another Palestinian died overnight after a clash
in the West Bank village of Salfit between soldiers and protesters.
Israel radio said his body was found in a car with four wanted
activists.
   The deaths brought to 414 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising against Israeli occupation began in December
1987. Eighteen Israelis have also died.
   In the northern Israeli village of Kfar Kanna, about 400 Moslem
fundamentalists marched carrying green Islamic banners and chanted
Koranic verses.
   Anti-Israeli protests and marches were also planned in three
other villages inside Israel, including Nazareth, where Jesus spent
his youth.
   Police said strike-enforcers hurled stones at taxi cabs breaking
the strike in Nazareth, where shops were closed and police guarded
the entrance to the predominantly Arab town of 40,000.
   On the Golan Heights, which Israel annexed after capturing it
from Syria, underground leaflets were distributed to Druse Arabs
calling on them to join the Land Day strike.
   Ehud Olmert, Israel's Arab affairs minister, said on Israel
television Wednesday night that the protests were not justified and
warned: ``Arab leaders face a special responsibility test, and I
hope they pass it for the benefit of good relations.''
   The involvement of Israeli Arabs, who account for 740,000 of
Israel's 4.2 million people, raised particular concern in Israel.
The nearly 16-month Palestinian uprising has led Arabs with Israeli
citizenship to increasingly identify with the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   In a recent editorial, the Yediot Ahronot newspaper said there
was ``an effort by the underground leadership of the uprising to
sweep Israel's Arabs into extremism and bloodshed.''
   The last sympathy strike by Israeli Arabs commemorated the
proclamation of a Palestinian state by the PLO's parliament, which
met in Algiers Nov. 15.
   Police said the number of attacks carried out by Palestinian
nationalists in Israel _ 69 before in 1987 _ jumped to 208 last
year.
   In the most serious incident, 25 Israelis were wounded by
grenades in a Haifa shopping district last August.
   Last year, 30,000 Israeli Arabs marched on Land Day in support
of the Palestinian revolt against Israel's 21-year occupation.
There were no major incidents of violence inside Israel, but four
Palestinians died in clashes in the West Bank and Gaza.

   A judge today ordered a 17-year-old youth
returned to Alabama, rejecting arguments that his extradition to
face a possible death sentence would violate the District of
Columbia's ban on capital punishment.
   ``Nothing in the Constitution or elsewhere grants the District
of Columbia the power to enforce beyond its borders the district's
moral opposition to the death penalty,'' Superior Court Judge
Stephen F. Eilperin said.
   In his 27-page ruling, Eilperin gave Alabama authorities until
May 1 to pick up the 17-year-old, identified only by the initials
O.M. But he issued an immediate stay of his order until Tuesday to
give defense lawyers time to appeal his decision.
   O.M. faces Alabama juvenile delinquency charges of arson and
murder in connection with a May 1988 firebombing of a Gadsden,
Ala., apartment. In that incident, 14-month old Tamel Jackson was
killed.
   Eilperin said the Constitution ``leaves no room for the District
to interpose its objection to capital punishment between O.M. and
Alabama.''
   ``Alabama is entitled to have Alabama law govern criminal acts
committed on Alabama soil, by citizens of Alabama, against citizens
of Alabama,'' Eliperin said.
   Although not the key issue in this case, the age of the
defendant could become more of one in light of arguments in two
cases heard Monday by the Supreme Court.
   The high court is deliberating whether imposing the death
penalty on murderers who committed their crimes before the age of
18 represents ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the Eighth
Amendment to the Constitution.
   A ruling is expected in July.
   The boy's attorney, Gerald Fisher, argued at a hearing Tuesday
that legislation pased by the district's City Council outlawing the
death penalty must be applied by district courts to the interstate
agreement governing juvenile extraditions.
   But Paul Alper, assistant corporation counsel for the district
government, said the district's obligation to enforce the
interstate agreement was not changed by the council's ban on
capital punishment.
   Alper said the agreement does not give the district the
discretion to approve or reject juvenile extradition requests on
the basis of whether the juvenile might face the death penalty if
extradited.
   Eilperin seemed reluctant during Tuesday's hearing to accept the
contention by O.M.'s lawyers that the district's ban on capital
punishment would be violated if he approved Alabama's extradition
request.
   He told Fisher a ``major problem'' with the argument was that
O.M. is not threatened by the death penalty if he is tried as a
juvenile. And if Alabama decided to try him as an adult, Eilperin
said, he would be obligated under the Constitution to approve the
extradition, regardless of the ban on capital punishment.
   But Fisher said Alabama authorities cannot certify O.M. for
trial as an adult, thus subjecting him to a possible death
sentence, unless he first is returned to the state. Extradition, he
argued, would violate the district's death penalty ban because it
would enable Alabama authorities to try O.M. as an adult.
   O.M. was arrested by district authorities in December and has
been fighting extradition ever since. His uncle, Yul Devoe Guice,
31, was arrested by Alabama authorities soon after the bombing and
charged with murder and arson.
   The boy's grandmother, Alice Guice Thomas, testified at a
hearing last month that O.M., who is black, cannot get a fair trial
from the white authorities of Etowah County, Ala., because the
county's law enforcement officials have a longstanding vendetta
against her family.
   But Alper, arguing that the fairness of the Alabama judicial
system was not at issue in the case, said district officials
``would be annoyed at the very least if the courts in Alabama
attempted to pass judgment on our system of justice.''
   Alper also contended that a refusal by the district to enforce
the interstate agreement on juvenile extraditions in this case
would quickly turn the nation's capital into ``a haven for fleeing
fugitives.''

   The PLO's Executive Committee has
nominated Yasser Arafat to be president of the new independent
Palestinian state, a spokesman said today. Arafat is the only
candidate.
   Spokesman Ahmed Abderrahman said the nomination, made Tuesday,
will be submitted to the PLO's Central Committee for discussion and
possible action Friday.
   The meeting of the 70-member Central Committee serves as a sort
of mini-parliament session between regular meetings of the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   The Palestinian council on Nov. 15 proclaimed a Palestinian
state and voted to name an exile government for the state, which
would include the Israel-occupied West Bank, east Jerusalem and the
Gaza Strip.
   Israel has refused to accept an independent Palestinian state
and rejects negotiations with the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist organization.
   As soon as Arafat's nomination is confirmed, he will
simultaneously fill the functions of president of the PLO Executive
Committee, commander-in-chief of Palestinian armed forces and
president of the independent state of Palestine.

<HEAD>US Asks Soviets To Limit Arms And Ideology In Latin America</HEAD>

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III appealed
to the Soviet Union today to limit its export of arms and ideology
to Latin America.
   ``We are looking for signs of new thinking,'' Baker said. ``The
Soviet Union now has an opportunity to demonstrate it in Central
America.''
   Baker made his appeal in a speech to a conference in Atlanta
hosted by former Presidents Carter and Ford.
   Baker said the Bush administration was committed to work with
leaders of the hemispheric democracies to promote political
solutions to armed conflicts.
   He cited as an example last week's accord with Congress
providing aid for Nicaraguan Contra rebels and support for regional
peace efforts.
   However, Baker said, `'the United States will never support a
paper agreement that sells out the Nicaraguan people's right to be
free.'' Nor, he said, ``should any other democracy in this
hemisphere.''
   Directing his remarks to the Soviet Union and others who support
the Marxist government in Nicaragua, Baker said: ``We must send a
clear message to others outside this hemisphere: this is not a
dumping ground for their arms or their failed ideology.''
   Baker made no direct reference to the military aid the United
States gave given to the Contras in their attempt to overthrow the
Sandinista government in Managua before Congress ordered a cut-off.
   He said the United States supports dialogue between the two
sides and also between the U.S.-backed government in El Salvador
and Marxist guerrillas in that country ``so the guns of war can
stand silent through Central America.''
   His appeal to the Soviets for ``new thinking'' appeared timed to
the visit Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will make next week
to Cuba, the Soviets' closest ally in the hemisphere.
   Baker, a former treasury secretary, also said there was no
``magic solution'' to the economic problems in Latin America.
   He said hard-pressed countries must reform their ``bloated
state-dominated economies,'' keep up with debt obligations ``and
satisfy the needs of their citizens.''
   He acknowledged, though, that this was ``a nearly impossible
juggling act'' and gave assurances that the United States was
prepared ``to hear your calls for help.''
   Baker's call for cooperation between the United States and the
other nations of the region drew immediate praise from House
Speaker Jim Wright, a participant in the Atlanta conference, who
also pledged a spirit of bipartisanship on the issue.
   ``When the president of the United States or our secretary of
state speaks to a foreign audience, those who hear him are entitled
to know he speaks for all of us in the United States. As one
representative of the loyal opposition in Congress, I should like
to reiterate that what Secretary Baker had just said is said on
behalf of us all,'' said Wright, D-Texas.
   Referring to the United States' approach to Latin America,
Wright said, ``Within our own internal government relations we have
replaced an old bitter spirit of confrontation with a new spirit of
cooperation.''

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Aparaguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior police officer, widely
accused of torture during the regime of deposed President Alfredo
Stroessner, has been suspended from duty, an official said today.
   Alberto Cantero, former head of the political section of the
investigations department of the Asuncion police, was suspended
Tuesday so he could ``prepare his defense before superiors and
perhaps before a judge,'' said Osvaldo Palacios, a police spokesman.
   Human rights groups have accused Cantero of directing the
torture of scores of political dissidents and others prior to a
Feb. 3 coup that ousted Stroessner, an army general who ruled
Paraguay nearly 35 years.
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez led the coup and is president.
   ``This should have happened immediately after the coup, not only
with Cantero but with other torturers that remain at their jobs,''
said Francisco de Vargas, a human rights attorney for the Committee
of Churches.
   The attorney said at least 50 people said Cantero was one of
those who ordered abuses ranging from beating, whipping, repeated
dunking in a tub of dirty water and electric shocks. He said
another 12 known torturers remain at their jobs in Asuncion and in
the interior of the country.
   Cantero was replaced by Obdulio Arguello Britez, said Palacios.
   Two other police officers, Augusto Caceres Spelt and Camilo
Almada Saprisa, also accused of torture under the Stroessner
regime, were suspended two weeks ago. Both were subordinates of
Cantero.
   De Vargas said no action has been taken on criminal court suits
filed against Cantero and other police officials March 17 by 42
alleged torture victims.
   ``This means the justice system is the same one that existed
under the Stroessner regime,'' said de Vargas. ``We have given them
too many days to act and they have yet to issue one arrest order,''
he added.
   During a meeting with human rights lawyers earlier this month,
Attorney General Diogenes Martinez pledged to follow up on
accusations made by those who claim to have been tortured and
punish the guilty.

   The wreck of a ship that sank two weeks ago with a
load of dangerous insecticide has been found, but a container of
the chemical is still missing, the Department of Transport said
today.
   The 263-ton Indonesian ship Perintis was found 35 miles
southeast of Brixham, on the south coast of England, said a
transport spokesman.
   The ship sank in the English Channel in a storm March 13, and
five of its six containers of Lindane insecticide were recovered.
The missing container was lost when tow ropes snapped as it was
being hauled back to Cherbourg in France.
   Ecologists have warned that if the container spills, it could
cause an ecological disaster with dire consequences for 30 years
afterward.
   The transport spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with
British custom, said the wreck was found by a remote-controlled
camera on a vessel chartered by the department.
   He said the container in which the chemical is stored has an
underwater life of a year.
   Lindane is a toxic insecticide used widely by farmers and
gardeners.

<TEXT>
   A highly infectious disease is
wiping out millions of young lake trout in hatcheries and could set
back the effort to restock the Great Lakes with the game fish for
years, officials say.
   ``The best thing we can do now is eradicate all of the fish at
infected hatcheries, disinfect and start over,'' Dr. Terence
Bradley, a University of Rhode Island researcher leading the trout
herpes study, said Wednesday.
   The Great Lakes Fishery Commission agrees, recommending that
infected hatcheries be withdrawn from stocking programs until they
are disease-free. The commission represents the Great Lakes states,
Ontario and two Indian tribes.
   Bradley and federal scientists believe the virus is new, showing
up only in hatcheries in the past decade. It appears to kill only
young fish, and poses no threat to humans.
   Infected trout haven't been released into the wild, said John
Driver, spokesman for a state hatchery in Marquette, Mich.
Researchers are unsure how fast the disease can spread in a lake,
where fish are less crowded and under less stress.
   ``If we stock contaminated fish, nothing could happen _ or it
could wipe out the entire population of lake trout. It would be too
late then to say, `Whoops, we made a mistake,''' said Jerry
McClain, manager of a federal hatchery in Iron River, Wis.
   The loss of millions of young fish in hatcheries wouldn't
immediately affect sport fishermen in the Great Lakes, since they
must take older fish, but fishing would be affected in long run,
officials said.
   Three state hatcheries in Wisconsin and Michigan and the Iron
River hatchery lost their entire young lake trout populations to
the virus in the past two years. The Marquette hatchery alone has
lost more than 4 million since the virus appeared in the early
1980s.
   In the most drastic move yet to stop the infection, the Iron
River hatchery killed its entire brood stock _ mature fish 10 to 15
years old _ and started over this winter with eggs from Wyoming,
McClain said.
   State officials in Wisconsin and Michigan are considering doing
the same.
   All of the affected hatcheries have undergone repeated partial
disinfection programs that so far have failed to stop the disease.
   All it takes to reinfect a group of fish, Bradley said, ``is a
little bit of water from one tank to another tank _ maybe from a
fishnet or even an animal on the grounds. It is very difficult to
eradicate.''

   As evidence of the diversion of Iran arms
sales money to the Nicaraguan rebels seeped out, one stunned
Justice Department official said, ``Jeez, that can't be,'' while
another remarked, ``You're kidding,'' an aide to former Attorney
General Edwin Meese III testified today.
   John Richardson, the attorney general's ex-chief of staff, told
the jury at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial that as he sat in
North's office at the National Security Council on Nov. 22, 1986,
Meese aide William Bradford Reynolds ``gave me a nudge under the
table.''
   Richardson said Reynolds then showed him a portion of a memo by
North outlining a planned diversion of money from the Iran arms
sales to the Contra rebels.
   ``I said something under my breath like, `Jeez, that's can't
be,' and Brad shrugged and went back'' to what he was doing after
returning the memo to the file, Richardson.
   At the time, North aide Robert Earl was wandering in and out of
the office.
   Richardson and Reynolds ran into North as they went out to lunch
and asked for files from 1985 on the Iran arms initiative.
   North ``seemed surprised'' and said ``you should have them
all,'' Richardson testified, adding that North told them, ``I will
make sure you have them'' by the time they returned from lunch.
   Earl testified earlier this week that North spent that lunch
hour picking up documents from his office pertaining to the
Iran-Contra affair and walked them to a shredder in the White House
Situation Room, where national security crises are monitored.
   North had destroyed so many documents the previous night that
the shredder in his own office had broken, Earl told the U.S.
District Court jury.
   When Reynolds told Meese during lunch at a restaurant about
North's diversion memo, the attorney general was ``very surprised''
while Meese aide Charles Cooper remarked, ``You're kidding,''
Richardson recalled.
   After they returned to North's office to continue their review
of documents on the Iran initiative, North told them that he would
be leaving the White House and back commanding a Marine battalion
soon.
   ``Someone's going to have to take the hit for this'' arms
initiative by the Reagan administration to Iran, North said,
according to Richardson.
   The attorney general said he didn't tell North until the next
day about the other unfolding aspect that his aides had just
uncovered: the diversion of funds to the Contras. Richardson, who
took notes at a Nov. 23, 1986 interview in Meese's office, recalled
that North showed ``a flash of surprise when mention was made of
the diversion.''
   North's attorneys, meanwhile, underscored their request for
former President Reagan's appearance at the trial.
   Defense attorney Brendan Sullivan emphasized the misstatements
Reagan made as word of the Iran arms initiative leaked out in early
and mid-November 1986.
   In cross-examining Cooper on the witness stand, Sullivan brought
out that Reagan on Nov. 6, 1986 had said there was no substance to
news reports of the Iran arms sales. Sullivan also mentioned a Nov.
19, 1986 statement in which the president said he had not condoned
arms shipments to Iran by the Israelis.
   Reagan objected Wednesday to the possibility of having to appear
at North's trial, saying through his lawyer that it hasn't been
shown his testimony is needed.
   The Justice Department also objected to North's subpoena for
Reagan to appear, saying that ``any live testimony by a former
president is fraught with peril to the national security and to
international relations.''
   As Reagan made his objection, Cooper said the attorney general's
aides never followed through with plans to interview Reagan about a
possibly illegal November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from
Israel to Iran.
   Reagan, who was eventually interviewed by the Tower Commission
on the matter, initially told the panel he had objected to the
shipment.
   But Reagan later stated that both he and White House chief of
staff Donald Regan agreed they couldn't recall any meeting or
conversation about the Hawk shipment.
   North is accused of obstructing Congress by preparing a false
chronology that stated no one in the U.S. government knew until
January 1986 that the November 1985 shipment contained arms.
   The CIA had arranged for an agency-run airline to handle the
shipment, which took place without prior presidential approval.
Reagan signed a finding of approval after the weapons were
delivered.
   Cooper said the fact-finding mission in November 1986 on the
administration's secret Iran arms initiative was ``overwhelmed''
when North confirmed on Nov. 23, 1986, that money had been diverted
to the Contras.

   A judge today refused to move the wife of spy
Jonathan Pollard from a federal prison hospital where she says she
is isolated and mistreated.
   U.S. District Judge Harry MacLaughlin ordered that Anne
Henderson Pollard, 28, remain at the Federal Medical Center in
Rochester, and he denied an independent medical review.
   Mrs. Pollard had sued to be moved back to a federal prison in
Danbury, Conn.
   She said the hospital, where she was sent for a gastrointestinal
disorder and other conditions, was making her worse because she is
the only woman there, the staff hates her and she was put under
24-hour surveillance.
   Authorities said that the surveillance has been lifted and that
Mrs. Pollard was making herself sicker by not eating.
   MacLaughlin today said he found ``no deliberate indifference''
to Mrs. Henderson's needs.
   Jonathan Pollard, 34, was sentenced in 1987 to life in prison
for supplying classified documents to Israeli agents. Mrs. Pollard
was sentenced to five years in prison on charges including being an
accessory after the fact.

   A secretary in a government office in San
Francisco might make more than a secretary doing similar work for
the same agency in Kansas City under a pay recommendation submitted
to President Bush.
   The proposal, opposed by some union leaders, is part of a
64-page report that was handed to the president Wednesday by the
National Commission on the Public Service. The report lists ways to
make federal service more attractive.
   The commission, a private body with a number of former or
present federal officials among its 36 members, concluded that the
present system of trying to make government salaries uniform
nationwide and comparable with private industry pay is unworkable.
   It recommended instead ``a pay-setting system that recognizes
the fact that public employees live and work in localities
characterized by widely different living costs and labor market
pressures, and adjusts compensation upward accordingly.''
   ``Under such a system, federal employees would continue to
receive the same base pay for the same job, but in large areas of
the country many would also receive an allowance designed to
compensate for higher living costs and labor competition,'' the
commission said.
   Its report said the latest survey by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics shows that government employees' pay lags behind that of
comparable workers in private industry by a national average of 22
per cent.
   ``The commission believes the president and Congress must give a
higher budget priority to civil service pay,'' the commission said.
   But, the report added, ``it is no longer appropriate or workable
to use a national average to establish an appropriate level of
pay.''
   ``The world of work has changed too much for such a broad
approach,'' it said, citing wage surveys that show geographic
differences of more than 30 per cent in some cases for similar jobs.
   ``These locality and occupational differences seriously
undermine the fairness of the current civil service pay process,
especially when all federal employees receive the same pay whether
they work in low-cost areas such as Kansas City or Norfolk, Va., or
high-cost areas such as San Francisco or Boston,'' the commission
said.
   Douglas Fraser, a former president of the United Automobile
Workers who is a member of the commission, said organized labor
generally supports the commission's report but is opposed to
locality pay.
   ``It creates in many cases gross inequalities,'' Fraser said.
   Spokesmen for government unions also reacted coolly.
   John N. Sturdivant, national president of the American
Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, said, ``Before the
commission addresses the issue of locality pay for federal workers
as suggested by this report, steps must be taken to close the
current 22 percent pay gap.''
   Robert M. Tobias, president of the National Treasury Employees
Union, said the report contained ``no systematic program to remedy
the pay crisis'' for government workers.
   ``The report holds out the false hope that pay increases can be
absorbed in current agency budgets and through reductions in
force,'' Tobias said. ``That premise is a sure road to further
demoralization and eventual chaos in the work force.''
   The commission also recommended pay increases for members of
Congress, federal judges and top federal officials, designed to
bring their purchasing power back to its 1969 level by the time the
next Congress meets in 1991. The commission said their purchasing
power has declined 35 per cent in the last 20 years.
   Bush, receiving the report, said: ``This is very timely. In the
next few days, I'll be making some very specific proposals.''
   He did not say what the proposals would be, and White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to elaborate.
   Fitzwater said today that by signaling plans to submit
legislation, Bush on Wednesday had meant to say that he would be
sending Congress his proposals on a new ethics law.
   The spokesman said that Bush would most likely have a public
comment at that time on the pay issue. But he said that ``it has
not been decided yet whether that would be a pay raise for federal,
congressional and judiciary, just judicial, or whatever.''
   ``It's unlikely that he would have anything to say about
congressional pay raises, but he will have comments about judicial
pay raises as it relates to ethics legislation,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said that Bush ``will not have specific proposals on
legislation on any pay raise for anyone within the next week or
two,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush plans a short visit to
West Germany at the end of May after the 16-nation NATO summit in
Brussels, sources confirmed today.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the officials said Bush's
schedule had not yet been determined, but that he would hold
official visits and talks with Bonn officials on May 30 and 31.
   Bush will meet with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the
other leaders of North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations during
the alliance summit in the Belgian capital on May 28-30.
   The trip is expected to be Bush's first European visit since he
took office as president in January.
   The last U.S. presidential visit to West Germany was in 1987,
when President Ronald Reagan stopped in Berlin after an economic
summit in Venice, Italy. He also visited Bonn and Bitburg during a
May 1985 visit.

<HEAD>USDA Says Yams Are Not Sweet Potatoes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Popeye had been a sweet potato, he wouldn't
have dared say, ``I yam what I yam and that's all I yam'' around
certain people in the Agriculture Department.
   ``Sweet potatoes and yams come from different biological and
geographical origins,'' says USDA economist Amy Allred. ``However,
the darker varieties of sweet potatoes are often erroneously called
yams.''
   In fact, the United States produces virtually no yams of its
own. Sweet potatoes, yes, around 12 million hundredweight a year,
or roughly 545,000 metric tons.
   But that's far down the world's production list, with global
output in 1987 at nearly 133 million tons. China is the biggest
producer at 113 million tons.
   Yam production is much smaller at about 24 million tons, with
most grown in Africa. Nigeria, with a 1987 production of 16 million
tons, is the leading producer.
   Allred says in a report by the department's Economic Research
Service that sweet potatoes have been cultivated since prehistoric
times in two widely separated parts of the world, tropical America
and the South Pacific islands.
   Early artifacts show yams were used for food in West Africa
prior to 50,000 B.C, and have been grown in Southeast Asia since
3,000 B.C.
   Allred was amused when the label from a supermarket can of
``yams'' was read to her in a telephone interview. The label said
yams in large letters, with ``sweet potatoes'' in finer print.
   ``Traditionally, people call them yams,'' she said. ``It's
pretty common.''
   But somewhere along the line, the yam-sweet potato question was
settled partly, at least, in North Carolina, the leading U.S.
producer. It is now the North Carolina Sweetpotato Commission, with
no mention of yams in the official title.
   North Carolina produced 4.59 million hundredweight of sweet
potatoes last year, followed at a distance by Louisiana, 2.47
million, and California, 1.31 million. Other commercial sweet
potato states include Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New
Jersey, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
   Allred's report included further information about the
differences between sweet potatoes and yams:
   _ There are a thousand species of sweet potato, which has a
two-leafed embryo and thus is called a dicot. It also is a member
of the morning-glory family. The flesh varies from nearly white to
almost orange in color.
   _ In the United States, per capita sweet potato consumption
reached a high of 6.4 pounds in 1982. Comparatively, Americans eat
an average of about 119 pounds of regular potatoes annually,
measured on the basis of farm weight.
   _ Most domestic use of sweet potatoes is in candied or baked
dishes, but they are also used in puddings, pies and even ice
cream. The industry in recent years has promoted new products,
including fresh fried sweet potatoes.
   _ Yams have one-leafed embryos and are called monocots. They can
be prepared in the same way as sweet potatoes. Most are consumed in
the countries that produce them, often turned into flour and then
into various staple dishes. Yams also are a source of a steroid
compound used as a base in cortisone and hormonal drugs.

   A 10-year boom in U.S. aquaculture production
slowed last year as catfish farmers eased back on expanding their
operations, according to the Agriculture Department.
   Overall, U.S. production of edible and non-edible aquaculture
products increased only 40 million pounds last year, compared with
a 1987 growth of more than 100 million pounds, the department's
Economic Research Service said Wednesday in a preliminary report.
   Despite the throttling back in catfish production, total 1988
output grew 5.2 percent to a record 295 million pounds, the report
said. Catfish growth was more than 32 percent in 1987 and 11
percent in 1986.
   Catfish production was accompanied by a 23.6 percent increase in
prices paid to farmers by processors in 1988. Those price averages
ranged from $1.61 per pound in California to 71 cents in Louisiana.
   ``However, higher feed and energy costs led to a 20 percent to
25 percent increase in production costs, which meant that net
returns (to farmers) were only 5 percent to 10 percent higher,''
the report said.
   Trout producers surveyed by the agency sold 58.9 million pounds
with a value of $63.6 million between Sept. 1, 1987, and Aug. 31,
1988, the report said. Producers also sold more than 361 million
trout eggs worth $2.8 million.
   Production of pen-raised salmon was estimated at six million
pounds in 1988, a 70 percent increase from 1987. The report said
domestic salmon production ``will probably continue to see large
gains'' in the next few years.

   The Agriculture Department says private
exporters have sold the Soviet Union an additional 450,000 metric
tons of U.S. corn, the second big purchase this week.
   The department said Wednesday that delivery is planned for the
current marketing year, which will end Aug. 31. An order for
550,000 tons of corn was reported on Tuesday.
   Officials said the latest sales brought total corn sold to the
Soviets for 1988-89 to almost 11.2 million tons. Additionally,
sales include 4 million tons of wheat, 450,000 tons of soybeans,
1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 450,000 tons of
corn would be about 17.7 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.59 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $46 million.

   Environmentalists are sponsoring a 5,200-mile run
across China to highlight its ecological problems.
   About a dozen people from China and Japan have already signed up
for the May 1 run across the plateau of western China to its wooded
northeast, said Wang Gaoling, an organizer of the For Tomorrow, Run
Through China group. Some have signed up to run the whole distance,
while others will only run segments.
   Wang's group is made up of volunteers but has backing from the
Ministry of Forestry and China Central Television, he said.
   Wang said his group will also start a drive to raise funds for
the environmentally damaged areas of Beijing, Xian in the west and
Changchun in the northeast.
   In a related development, delegates at the ongoing session of
the National People's Congress, China's legislature, have proposed
the establishment of an environmental protection committee. China
already has an Environmental Protection Commission, which reports
to the State Council, or Cabinet.

<TEXT>
   More than 300 experts will meet Friday to
look at ways of saving the 2,400-year-old Acropolis temples from
the ravages of time and pollution.
   The Committee for the Preservation of the Acropolis Monuments
said the experts will focus on restoring the Parthenon temple's
eastern portico.
   The portico, which stood behind the monument's eastern colonade,
formed the antechamber to the main Parthenon temple and was one of
the most important places on the monument, said Charalambos Bouras,
who heads the committee.
   The participants, who include seismologists, architects and
chemists, will evaluate progress on the 10-year restoration work
that started in 1985.
   ``The Acropolis temples belong to humanity and are of
inestimable worth ... it's not only up to the Greeks to restore
them but the whole international community,'' Bouras said.
   Greece spends $9.6 million annually on restoration work on the
Acropolis, which was built between 447 B.C. and 405 B.C. The site
draws more than 2 million visitors every year.

<HEAD>Crowd Incident Highlights Shortage of Consumer Goods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The line for imported boots started forming just
after dawn, but the goods sold out in 30 minutes.
   As the crowd pushed forward in vain, a railing gave way and four
people were hurt when they fell 12 feet to the ground.
   The incident, which occurred Tuesday and was reported Thursday
by the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, highlights the dreary
outlook for Soviet shoppers who search the city for items such as
sugar, detergent, men's socks and chocolate.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has told them improving food
supplies and consumer goods are his top priority, although it will
take time. Frustrated consumers complain things have only gotten
worse.
   The weekly newspaper Moscow News recently counted 500 people
lined up for fur hats and 300 waiting to buy nightgowns made of a
synthetic fabric.
   Moskovsky Komsomolets said the four people who were hurt in the
shopping incident all lived outside of Moscow, some of the
thousands of Soviets who stream into the capital to search for
goods not available in their towns and villages. Bare as they are,
Moscow's shelves have more than provincial cities.
   Moscow News said it found a 62-year-old woman who had traveled
900 miles from the Caucasus city of Ordzhonikidze to shop in the
GUM department store on Red Square. She spent more than 90 minutes
in line to buy two nightgowns, one red and one blue.
   ``The red one is for my daughter, the second ... well, I don't
want it, old as I am. My daughter has a friend,'' it quoted her as
saying. ``If the girl doesn't like it, our next door neighbors
would, perhaps. I'm retired on a pension, so I am here to do some
shopping. Where I live, the shops are empty.''
   In another line, a young couple who took their vacation to shop
in Moscow bought three pairs of Romanian-made boots even though
they didn't fit.
   Shoes and boots have long been a sore spot with Soviet consumers.
   Economist Abel Aganbegyan, a key adviser to Gorbachev, said in
1987 that the Soviet Union produced 788 million pairs of leather
shoes in 1985, more than twice the number produced in the United
States, but nobody wanted them.
   ``These shoes lie around because they're not very comfortable,
they're not fashionable, they're not attractive,'' he said. ``If
someone buys them, it's only because there's nothing else. And if
they buy them, they never wear them.''
   That makes imported shoes highly desirable. In the Tuesday
incident, the line formed outside the shoe store an hour before the
shop opened, and the 200 pairs were gone in 30 minutes.
   Economics professor Tatyana Koryagina told the Moscow News the
only way to end the lines is to encourage a market economy in which
prices are set by demand rather than by the government. But
consumers oppose price increases and Gorbachev has promised there
won't be any for several years.
   There was a faint note of hope Thursday for shoe shoppers. The
Tass news agency said deals have been concluded with manufacturiers
in Italy and Yugoslavia to build 10 shoe factories in the Soviet
Union in the next decade.
   ``A flood of top-quality fashion shoes will engulf the Soviet
market,'' Tass said.

   Rebel inmates who seized
control of Guatemala's largest prison agreed today to end their
5-day-old uprising, a government negotiator said.
   ``We have an agreement in principle,'' Gonzalo Menendez de la
Riva, the head government negotiator told reporters when he emerged
from a morning meeting with the rebels.
   Menendez, the special attorney general for human rights, said he
would take the accord to the capital, 15 miles west of the prison,
for the signature of Interior Minister Roberto Valle Valdizan, then
return to the prison.
   He said he expected a the agreement would be signed by both
sides today.
   Red Cross officials were reportedly preparing to evacuate the
civilians inside the prison once the accord was signed.
   The government offered late Wednesday to replace the warden and
all the guards at the 1,350-inmate Pavon prison farm if the rebels
surrendered. the warden and the guards if the mutineers surrender.
   Between 75 and 100 rebel inmates armed with M-1 rifles have been
in control of the prison, Guatemala's largest, since Sunday. At
least four guards and three inmates died in the Easter revolt.
   About 600 people _ mostly women and children _ were visiting
when the uprising began. Some stayed inside with the inmates, and
authorities differed on whether they were hostages or whether they
stayed to protect their loved ones from security force reprisals.
   The government said it would consider the rebels' request for
pardons for crimes committed during the uprising and guarantee
their physical safety once they surrendered their arms and the
roughly 500 people with them.
   About 110 prisoners who took no part in the revolt fled
Wednesday from the section that remained under inmate control and
were taken into custody.
   Twenty relatives of inmates trapped inside when the uprising
started began also made their way out.
   In its Wednesday offer, the government also promised to promote
``strict application'' of a law providing for reduction of
sentences through work and present to Congress the mutineers'
demand for a nationwide reduction of all prison sentences by five
years.
   Any pardon or amnesty for crimes committed during the rebellion
would have to be enacted by Congress.
   However, Edmundo Vasquez Martinez, president of the Supreme
Court, said Wednesday that the court could not grant pardons for
crimes committed at Pavon.
   The inmates offered to surrender if the warden and guards were
replaced at Pavon, which is about 15 miles east of Guatemala City,
negotiator Julio Escobar Arango said.
   About 100 black-helmeted military police arrived Wednesday to
reinforce the 1,000 police and army troopers ringing the prison.
President Vinicio Cerezo has said force would not be used unless
prisoners try to shoot their way out.
   The rebels were described as hardened criminals serving long
sentences for crimes such as murder and kidnapping. They reportedly
include former security forces members.

   A sheriff has resigned after admitting he
took an inmate home for dinner and shared a hot tub with him.
   Jack T. Dolan on Wednesday denied any impropriety and said his
only wish was to help an inmate perform a community service.
   County commissioners had removed the 53-year-old sheriff from
his separate job as head of the corrections department two weeks
ago after learning he was under investigation by the attorney
general's office and a special prosecutor.
   The 18-year sheriff said he brought Mark Woosley, 21, to his
home several times to work on a woodshop project and had dinner
with him before sending him back to jail.
   ``Following a job well done ... I offered the inmate the use of
my hot tub. In the presence of my brother, I spent approximately 10
to 15 minutes in the hot tub with him,'' Dolan said.
   Dolan said that when Woosley told other inmates, Woosley ``was
harassed for working with the sheriff and derogatory comments of a
sexual nature were made.''
   The inmate's girlfriend complained, and sheriff's department
officials contacted the attorney general's office.
   The sheriff said he erred by ``departing from the normal and
traditional model of the jailer-prisoner relationship and in
failing to foresee that my actions could be misperceived by
others.''

   South Africa and the South-West Africa
People's Organization have agreed to a formal cease-fire in Namibia
beginning Saturday, a U.N. official said today.
   The Marxist-led SWAPO organization and the South African
military have been fighting a guerrilla war in the southwest
African territory since 1966, but have observed an informal truce
for months.
   In separate letters to Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, both parties agreed to begin honoring the cease-fire on
Saturday, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   That is the date that the United Nations is to begin
implementing a one-year plan to free Namibia from 74 years of South
African rule, resulting in a black majority-ruled sovereign state
next year.
   Perez de Cuellar has informed the Security Council that he
proposed the cease-fire to SWAPO and South Africa on March 14.
   ``South Africa and SWAPO respectively confirmed their agreement
to abide by the formal cease-fire from the date and time
proposed,'' said the U.N. chief's report to the council, read out
by Giuliani.

<TEXT>
   Former White House Press Secretary James Brady
won two standing ovations Thursday as he presented awards to two
community colleges honored for outstanding assistance to the
disabled.
   Brady, who was shot in the head in the 1981 assassination
attempt on President Reagan, returned to the scene of the crime,
the Washington Hilton, to make the awards to Catonsville (Md.)
Community College and John Wood (Ill.) Community College.
   Brady, who is brain-damaged and must use a wheelchair as a
result of the shooting, was recently named vice chairman of the
National Organization on Disability.
   ``I am pleased to recognize the important work you have done,''
he told the presidents of the two colleges. ``But I also call on
you, as I call on everyone, to do more.'''
   Brady said educators in particular have a special role in making
American life accessible to the disabled, and that means more than
building wheelchair ramps. ``It means removing attitudinal
barriers,'' he said. ``I call on you to make America a better place
for all of us.''
   The National Organization on Disability-J.C. Penney awards were
presented at the 69th annual conference of the American Association
of Community and Junior Colleges. The educators rose to their feet
after Brady's brief speech and again when he was introduced by
association president David Ponitz as a man who ``should have a
chapter in the profiles of courage.''
   The Maryland college was honored for its programs for deaf,
blind and hearing-impaired students; the Illinois college was cited
for a special needs transition program that eases disabled
students' paths to employment and further education.

   The federal government today said it won't
take over cleanup of the nation's worst-ever oil spill but will
watch closely because of the slick's ``enormous potential'' for
damage to the environment.
   The 500-square-mile slick continued to spread, uncontained by
the efforts of 444 personnel from the Coast Guard and other
agencies and dozens of fishermen backed by three Coast Guard
helicopters, two cutters, 33 contract vessels, five tugboats and a
dozen skimmers.
   Only 6,000 barrels of the 240,000 that spilled from an Exxon
tanker Friday have been recovered, officials said.
   ``Anyone who goes up and looks at the slick has to be humbled by
it,'' said Chief Petty Officer Todd Nelson.
   At the White House, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner,
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly and
Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Yost reported their first-hand
observations to President Bush, who decided against a federal
takeover.
   Bush gave ``top priority to assessing the adequacy of
environmental protection,'' Reilly said.
   ``This is obviously a disaster of enormous potential magnitude
on the environment,'' Reilly said. The habitats of sea otters and
sea lions are likely to be hardest hit, and the government also
will monitor salmon and herring in Prince William Sound, where the
disaster occurred Friday, he said.
   Exxon, whose 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef 25 miles
from Port Valdez, is doing a ``very craftsmanlike job'' with the
cleanup, Yost said.
   Skinner said the response ``could have been quicker,'' and
``most of the damage was done in the first few hours.''
   Yost defended Coast Guard radar operators who failed to spot and
warn the tanker, saying it was not in a treacherous or narrow area.
He said the Coast Guard will look into the license of the tanker's
captain.
   A daily newspaper covering shipping reported today that the
captain failed to disclose in his last license application that he
had been convicted of drunken driving twice in the previous five
years. A Coast Guard commander in New York told the Journal of
Commerce that Capt. Joseph Hazelwood checked ``no'' in 1986 to the
application's question about traffic violations.
   Of the 1.2 million barrels of crude oil the tanker was carrying,
Exxon said about 480,000 were transferred to another tanker, which
left for Hawaii today.
   Crews maneuvered another vessel to take the remainder of the oil
from the grounded ship. The operation is expected to take until
Saturday.
   In Anchorage, the first of an expected flood of lawsuits was
filed. The class-action suit seeking unspecified damages was filed
in the names two Prince William Sound fishermen. They accuse Exxon,
the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. and the state of gross negligence
in the spill and cleanup.
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that a barge intended as
a key piece of equipment against oil spills was not working Friday,
and Alyeska conceded it violated its own requirement that it notify
state environmental officials that the vessel was out of commission.
   Exxon, which has been heavily criticized for its response to the
10.1 million-gallon spill, said it will re-evaluate how it handles
such problems.
   ``Now that (the spill) has happened, it's incumbent on us and
the industry to profit in the maximum extent from the experience,''
said William Stevens, president of Exxon USA, the parent of the
Exxon Shipping Co. Inc.
   Wind and currents have stretched the slick into ragged patches
of iridescent oil on crystal blue water. The heavy goo surrounds
several islands.
   The oil is headed toward the Montague Strait, an outlet to the
Gulf of Alaska. Gov. Steve Cowper said that is where everyone hopes
the oil goes, ``rather than bouncing around like a pinball in
Prince William Sound and polluting it for years.''
   Mayor John Devens has estimated the loss to the fishing industry
at $150 million.
   ``This spill will devastate the ecosystem long after wildlife
that now has been exposed has died,'' said Jon Lyman, a spokesman
for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. He said thousands of
birds, including bald eagles, may die in the coming years.
   In another development, William Woody, chief of the four-member
National Transportation Safety Board team assigned to the disaster,
said a Coast Guard officer told investigators he smelled alcohol on
Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood's breath a few hours after
the ship ran aground.
   But the Guardsman and a harbor pilot agreed Hazelwood appeared
competent, Woody said.
   Exxon officials said Hazelwood was not on the bridge when the
accident occurred a half mile outside shipping lanes. Third mate
Gregory Cousins, who the Coast Guard says lacked proper
certification, was giving the orders.
   On the advice of their lawyers, Hazelwood and Cousins have
refused to talk to investigators, Woody said.

<TEXT>
   A third researcher has achieved cold
nuclear fusion, Brigham Young University reported, nearly a week
after two University of Utah scientists stunned the scientific
world with their own announcement.
   BYU Chemist Steven Jones will discuss his experiments in
room-temperature nuclear fusion at a colloquium at Columbia
University in New York City on Friday, school spokesman Paul
Richards said Wednesday.
   Nuclear fusion, the energy secret of the sun, has been sought by
scientists for 20 years.
   University of Utah researchers announced March 23 that they had
used a simple, low-cost experiment to achieve fusion.
   The announcment ignited skepticism and curiosity in the
scientific community and widespread interest among businesses eager
to cash in on the discovery.
   It also prompted speculation that the Utah researchers rushed to
disclose their findings to claim the limelight before the work
underwent close scrutiny in scientific publications.
   Electrochemists Stanley Pons of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of
the University of Southampton in England announced they had
sustained a controlled nuclear fusion reaction for more than 100
hours in a small glass flask.
   They said their process involved an electrical current used to
drive nuclear particles through a lattice of palladium and platinum
electrodes, forcing positively charged particles to fuse together
and create a new atom.
   Practical ways to achieve controlled nuclear fusion have long
been sought because of its potential as an inexpensive, virtually
inexhaustible source of energy that produces less radioactive waste
than nuclear reactors.
   Nuclear reactors are powered by fission, in which atoms are
split, not fused.
   Pons' and Fleischmann's process has not been subjected to peer
review, and the experiment has yet to be duplicated elsewhere.
Attempts are under way at several laboratories, including Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Italy's National
Association of Alternative Energy near Rome.
   Richards confirmed a report in the Wall Street Journal on
Wednesday that Jones had discovered that the nuclei of deuterium
atoms, a heavy form of hydrogen, can fuse inside a solid crystal
unaided by an external catalyst or the superhot temperatures
previously thought necessary for hydrogen fusion.
   Unlike the University of Utah experiment, which reportedly
produced four times as much energy as it consumed, Jones' work
produced extremely small amounts, Richards said.

   The Ukrainian Writers Union has posthumously
readmitted author Viktor Nekrasov who once won a Stalin prize but
was banished for speaking out in defense of Alexander Solzhenitsyn,
Tass said Thursday.
   Nekrasov won what was then the Soviet Union's highest literary
honor in 1946 for his book ``In the Trenches of Stalingrad'' about
the defense of the Volga River city in World War II.
   But the Kiev native expelled from the Writers Union and was
forced to leave the Soviet Union in 1974 for defending
Solzhenitsyn, who had been expelled. He settled in France and died
in 1987.
   ``Our organization has come out for Nekrasov's books to be
published anew and for his works written abroad to be printed in
Ukrainian journals,'' Yuri Mushketik, head of the Ukrainian Writers
Union, told Tass.
   He said a plaque will be hung at the Kiev house where Nekrasov
lived.

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods dropped 2.3 percent in February, the second straight monthly
decline, the government said Thursday in a report offering more
evidence the economy may be slowing.
   Orders fell to a seasonally adjusted $230.7 billion last month
after dropping 1.2 percent in January, the first back-to-back
declines since orders fell for four consecutive months starting in
February 1986, the Commerce Department said.
   Last month's decline was in line with a spate of other
government reports that showed slower growth in February and with
widespread expectations that the economy will cool off in this
seventh year of its record peacetime expansion.
   ``This confirms that February was a very weak month,'' said
economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
``It leaves unanswered the question of whether this is the start of
the slowdown we're expecting.''
   The decline would have been even bigger were it not for a 22.4
percent surge last month in defense orders, which are subject to
wide swings depending on when government contracts are signed.
   Excluding the military, orders were down 3 percent last month.
   The biggest negative factor in last month's orders picture was a
7.2 percent decline in the transportation category, reflecting
fewer orders for planes and cars.
   But even excluding the volatile transportation area, all other
orders still were down 1.4 percent last month.
   Economist Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank in New York said
that while the economy is growing at a slower pace than last year,
the drop in factory orders was largely a fallback from strong
demand in December, when orders rose 4.7 percent.
   ``It's more of a reaction to the strong numbers that we saw in
the past as opposed to true weakness,'' Niemira said.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth to reduce
inflationary pressures.
   The economy grew a robust 3.9 percent last year, the best
showing in four years, but analysts believe the pace will be closer
to 2.7 percent this year, with the slowdown most evident in the
second and third quarters.
   Factory orders had increased a healthy 9.7 percent in 1988 in
part due to an export-led boom that showed signs of stalling late
in the year.
   The back-to-back declines in orders during the first two months
of 1989 may suggest the Fed's slowdown campaign is taking effect,
Wyss said.
   ``The Fed's been raising rates for a year now,'' he said. ``It's
about time we started to see it in the real growth (statistics).''
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a
good indicator of future industry investment plans, orders dropped
8.2 percent in February to $37.1 billion after rising 2.3 percent
in January.
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods, items expected to last
three years or more, were down 3.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$124.2 billion after dropping 2.8 percent during the previous month.
   Declines were recorded in nearly all major industries, including
a 3.2 percent drop in orders for primary metals, with the steel
industry accounting for much of that decline.
   Demand for non-durable goods was down 1 percent to $106.5
billion last month, with the largest decreases coming in orders for
chemicals and rubber and plastics products.
   Shipments of manufactured goods were down 1.7 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $227.6 billion in February. It was the biggest
decline since March 1986, when shipments were down 2.4 percent.

   Prosecutors are seeking staggering prison terms
and more than $12 billion in penalties against junk bond wizard
Michael R. Milken and two others in the largest criminal action
against a Wall Street trader.
   The Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executive was indicted by a
federal grand jury Wednesday along with his 40-year-old brother,
Lowell J. Milken, and Bruce Lee Newberg, a former trader for
Drexel, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm.
   The long-expected indictment charged the three with turning
Drexel into a billion-dollar racketeering enterprise that used
Drexel's junk bond department for a series of securities frauds
with various unindicted co-conspirators. Among them are the
imprisoned Ivan Boesky and members of the defunct investment
partnership, Princeton-Newport Partners.
   All three defendants face up to 20 years in prison on each of
two racketeering charges, prosecutors said.
   Among other things, the indictment accused Milken of using
illegal inside information about merger proposals to arrange deals
and manipulate stocks.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the racketeering penalties were
the most ever sought against individuals under the 19-year-old
federal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act.
   But defense lawyers attacked the 98-count indictment as an abuse
of prosecutorial power and a tool to wrench cooperation from other
Drexel employees.
   They called the charges a ``perversion'' of the racketeering
act, which was established principally to combat organized crime
but is used increasingly to prosecute white-collar criminals.
   ``I think it is outrageous to use RICO in a circumstance like
this,'' said Michael Armstrong, an attorney for Lowell Milken.
``They applied the statute to behavior which for the most part has
not been considered even to be criminal, much less the subject of a
racketeering indictment.''
   The three defendants denied wrongdoing and said they would plead
innocent.
   ``After almost 2{ years of leaks and distortions I am now eager
to present all the facts in an open and unbiased forum,'' Michael
Milken said in a statement.
   Milken, 42, has headed Drexel's junk bond department since the
mid-1970s and is credited with revolutionizing corporate takeovers
by relying on the highly risky, high yielding securities, turning
them into a $175 billion annual market. The bonds also are often
used to help small and medium-size companies grow.
   The indictment described the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based junk
bond department as ``the driving force behind Drexel's business''
noting that between 1983 and 1987 it accounted for nearly half of
Drexel's profits.
   If convicted on the racketeering counts alone, each defendant
would face maximum fines of $3.7 billion, roughly double their
alleged illicit profits.
   In addition, the three are subject to forfeiture proceedings on
virtually all money they have made through their Drexel dealings
since 1984, an estimated $1.85 billion. That includes $1.2 billion
in salaries, $112 million in Drexel stock, $205 million in
corporate finance fees, $37 million in trading profits on allegedly
tainted deals and $257 million in interest.
   Michael Milken also was charged with all of the 96
non-racketeering counts, which include numerous mail, wire and
securities frauds. His brother was charged with 11 counts and
Newberg with 20 counts.
   If convicted of the non-racketeering charges, each would face a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and at least $250,000 in
fines per count, making Michael Milken subject to $24 million in
fines and a total of 520 years imprisonment.
   The indictment paralleled the Securities and Exchange
Commission's sweeping civil insider trading action against Drexel,
Milken and others last September.
   In December, Drexel struck a plea bargain with prosecutors that
called for the dismissal of Milken and the withholding of most of
his 1988 compensation _ estimated at between $100 million and $200
million.
   As part of the agreement, which Drexel says it made to avoid
crippling racketeering charges, the firm agreed to plead guilty to
six federal felony charges and pay a record $650 million in fines
and penalties.
   Drexel has not yet pleaded to the charges and settlement of the
criminal case remained subject to SEC approval.
   A Drexel statement said the Milkens had been placed on leave of
absence.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will meet soon with three Latin
American presidents _ Venezuela's Carlos Andres Perez, El
Salvador's Alfredo Cristiani and Costa Rica's Oscar Arias _ Bush's
spokesman said today.
   Perez, who took office in early February, will visit the White
House on Saturday for a working breakfast with Bush, Secretary of
State James A. Baker, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   The group is expected to discuss the Latin American debt crisis,
an issue on which Perez has taken a leadership role. Brady recently
announced an administration plan to deal with the more than $440
billion owed by the Latin countries.
   Cristiani, who won last week's election in El Salvador, will be
in Washington on April 7 for a meeting with Bush. At the time of
his election, Bush telephoned his congratulations to Cristiani and
expressed U.S. support for Salvadoran democracy.
   U.S. officials are known to be concerned about human rights
violations, some of them committed by the nation's military in the
violence-plagued country.
   Vice President Dan Quayle issued a stern warning to military
leaders and others on a one-day visit to el Salvador in February,
making clear that future U.S. aid would be conditioned on progress
in that area.
   Cristiani's conservative Arena party has been accused of
affiliation with death squad activity in the past, especially its
former leader Roberto D'Abuisson, who denies such involvement.
   Fitzwater said Arias will stop in Washington on Tuesday en route
to Canada. He and Bush are expected to discuss the emerging Central
American peace process, focusing on Nicaragua. Arias has been a
leader in the meetings of the five Central American presidents as
they attempt to work out a plan for disbanding the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.

   President Bush has urged Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev as he prepares to visit Cuba to use his influence in
Nicaragua to further Central American peace efforts, White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   Asked if Bush had renewed U.S. requests for the Soviets to push
the Nicaraguans toward democratic reforms or withdraw their
assistance to the Central American nation, Fitzwater noted that
Secretary of State James Baker had discussed that position recently
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. He said the same
U.S. views have been expressed elsewhere.
   ``The president has made his views known to Secretary General
Gorbachev on this issue,'' Fitzwater said. ``We would like to see
the Soviet Union to use its influence in Nicaragua to bring about a
peaceful settlement of the situation.''
   ``We would like to see the Soviet Union withdraw their resources
and support in Nicaragua,'' he said. ``And we would like to see
Secretary Gorbachev take an active role in furthering both of those
objectives.''
   Meanwhile, in a speech in Atlanta, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III urged the Soviets to show ``signs of new thinking'' in
Central America. He said the region was ``not a dumping ground''
for arms and failed ideologies of outsiders.
   And at the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
the Soviet Union and Cuba `'through their continued aid and support
of violence and subversion in the region have been undermining the
prospects for peaceful resolution'' of the conflict in Nicaragua
through diplomacy.
   One way, the U.S. official said, would be to stop the flow of
arms.
   Over the next week, Fitzwater said, Bush plans to meet
separately in Washington with three Latin American presidents. He
said Venezuela's Carlos Andres Perez is set to arrive Saturday for
a working breakfast with Bush, Baker, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and national security advisor Brent Scowcroft. They are to
discuss the Latin Amrican debt crisis.
   Costa Rica's Oscar Arias is set to arrive Tuesday for a stopover
en route to Canada and El Salvador's Alfredo Christiani on April 7.
   Fitzwater said he could not reveal what specific diplomatic
overtures had been made to Gorbachev as he prepares to visit Cuba.
He did say, however, that ``you can assume that the president's
views have been made to the general secretary ... in the past and
recently.''
   Fitzwater reiterated the U.S. position that any positive moves
on the part of the Soviets toward Nicaragua would be looked upon
favorably by the United States. Officials have raised the
possibility of improved economic relations between the United
States and Soviet Union if Gorbachev would take a good faith step
in Nicaragua.
   ``It would certainly help in improving U.S.-Soviet relations,
East-West relations in general,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The interrelationship of all these issues is readily
apparent,'' he said.
   Bush has said the Soviets should stop providing military aid to
Nicaragua and that the Soviet interest in the region is far less
than the U.S. concern for its relationships in Central America.
   While the United States has backed the Contra rebels seeking to
overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government and has imposed a trade
embargo, the Soviet Union has provided trade and military
assistance to the Sandinistas.
   Gorbachev arrives in Havana Sunday for a three-day visit. The
trip was to have taken place last year but was put off because of
the disastrous earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   The New York Times reported today that the Bush administration
wants Gorbachev to say something while in Cuba that would signal a
willingness to change its posture toward Nicaragua.

   President Bush will meet Monday with four
family members of Americans killed when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded
over Lockerbie, Scotland, the White House said Thursday.
   Bush will ``hear their concerns,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the
White House press secretary. The families are planning a memorial
service that afternoon in Lafayette Park, across the street from
the White House, he said.
   Fitzwater did not identify the four who will meet with Bush.
   The plane went down Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard and
another 11 on the ground.
   U.S. officials have denied knowledge of who was responsible for
the bombing.
   Investigators have confirmed a bomb caused the explosion. It was
contained in a radio-cassette player in the baggage hold.
   The plane had just left London's Heathrow Airport en route to
New York when the explosion occurred.

<HEAD>Non-Binding Gun Ban On Ballot In Town That Had School Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNETKA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents in this affluent Chicago suburb
will vote Tuesday on a handgun ban less than a year after an
8-year-old was killed and six children were wounded in a school
shooting rampage.
   The advisory vote was set because the issue is so emotional in a
community still scarred by the day last May when Laurie Dann walked
into a school and began shooting at pupils.
   Ms. Dann also wounded a man away from the school and then killed
herself.
   Some children are drawing posters favoring a handgun ban, while
opponents are saying the ban would be announcing to the world they
are ``sitting ducks.''
   The referendum was the idea of ban opponents, who say they want
to prove that most residents oppose giving up their firearms.
   Theordore Herst said a handgun ban would send the wrong message
in a metropolitan area with a high crime rate. ``It is a simplistic
band-aid solution to a major problem,'' Herst said Wednesday.
   ``The firearms in the village are owned by very reliable
citizens, retired military officers, sportsmen,'' Herst said.
``This isn't Dodge City, Detroit or Washington.''
   Leading the ban effort is George Fisher, whose daughter,
Lindsay, was seriously wounded by Ms. Dann. Lindsay Fisher is
recovered and back in school.
   ``The carnage ... all over the country will not stop until local
communities say, `enough is enough,' and apply pressure to their
state legislators to develop statewide handgun controls, and the
states, in turn, start looking to Congress,'' Fisher said.
   Highland Park approved a ban on the possession of handguns
Monday night. Morton Grove, Oak Park, Evanston and Wilmette have
similar laws.

   A mechanical failure of Disneyland's
Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride caused one car to tip sideways and
slightly injured a couple and their little girl, a spokesman said.
   The fiberglass elephant in which the family was riding partially
separated from a supporting arm Wednesday and tipped about 45
degrees, said Bob Roth, a spokesman for Disneyland.
   Eli Martinez, 33, of Garden Grove was belted in but his upper
body apparently grazed an elevated concrete walkway around the ride
and he suffered bruises and scrapes, Roth said. Martinez's wife and
child, also belted in, suffered lesser bruises.
   Dumbo features cars on the end of arms that go up and down as
the ride rotates. The faulty car was about 6 feet off the ground
when it broke, Roth said.
   The ride was closed to determine the cause of the failure.
   It was the second accident at the park in March. A hundred
riders were stranded for up to four hours when the aerial Skyway
buckets halted March 18. That ride was put back in operation March
22.

   Michael S. Bernstein's final assignment for
the Justice Department before his death in the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 last December was to negotiate the deportation of a
former Nazi death camp guard to Austria. The deportation is now
completed.
   Josef Eckert, 65, who was an SS guard at the Auschwitz death
camp during World War II, flew out of the United States on Tuesday
night and arrived today in Salzburg, Austria via Zurich,
Switzerland.
   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller said Wednesday that
Eckert had fallen asleep at Heathrow Airport in London and missed
his connecting flight that day.
   Eckert had concealed his Auschwitz service from U.S. immigration
officials when he obtained a visa to come to the United States in
1956, the department said. At the time, he was living in Austria.
   Eckert, who had been living in La Puente, Calif., admitted last
Sept. 27 that he had been a member of the SS guard unit assigned to
Auschwitz where he guarded prisoners. Millions of people were
murdered during his time of service there.
   Bernstein, a member of the department's Office of Special
Investigations, negotiated with the Austrian government to arrange
Eckert's return to that country, and Austria agreed to the return
last December.
   Bernstein was flying home from those negotiations when the plane
exploded over Scotland on Dec. 21.
   ``The successful completion of the Eckert case is a fitting
tribute to Mike Bernstein's prosecutorial and diplomatic skills and
to his dedication to the pursuit of justice,'' Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh said in a statement.

   Rolling Stone bass guitarist Bill Wyman will marry
19-year-old model Mandy Smith in June, his press agent said.
   The relationship caused a scandal in the British tabloid press
six years ago when Wyman, 52, first started dating the 13-year-old
schoolgirl. The couple later split up but have gotten back together.
   ``They are both naturally delighted,'' said the bassist's press

   Massey said he received the news of the marriage plans from
Wyman, who is in the United States recording for the Rolling Stones.
   The couple plan a June wedding, but have not yet decided where,

   Pulitzer Prize-winning author Eudora Welty
will celebrate her 80th birthday nearly two weeks early, but the
Mississippi Symphony Orchestra already has a gift.
   The symphony on Sunday will play ``Happy Birthday'' and a
concerto written especially for her. Her birthday is April 13.
   The idea for the special tribute ``Concerto for Orchestra:
Images From Welty'' came from the symphony's conductor, Colman
Pearce.
   When he came to Jackson from Dublin, Ireland, 18 months ago,
Pearce said he ``wanted to know who were the distinguished artists
here. I made it my business to read her (Welty's) works, among
others.''
   In October 1987, initial steps were taken to commission the
work, he said. Composer Jim Sclater of Jackson was commissioned to
write the concerto.
   ``I also wanted someone who was living in Mississippi to do
this,'' Pearce explained. ``I found in Jim Sclater someone who was
attuned to it.''
   Welty, who was born in Jackson, said she has not heard the
concerto but is looking forward to the concert.
   ``You can imagine how excited and delighted I am,'' she said.
``I think it's a marvelous thing, and I'm deeply honored and
thrilled by the whole thing. Who could help but be?''

   Civil rights activist Dick
Gregory has moved his weight-reduction institute from one
beachfront resort hotel to another after plans to buy the first
fell through.
   The former comedian, who specializes in a dieting and exercise
program for severely obese people, announced last November that had
moved his institute from Newark, N.J., to the 117-room Beachmark
Inn in this Florida Panhandle city, saying he had purchased the
building for $10 million.
   But Beachmark owner Clay Ridgeway said Wednesday that Gregory
had only leased the hotel for four months with an option to buy for
$7 million. The option was exercised in January, but Gregory failed
to meet a March 1 deadline and extension for closing, Ridgeway said.
   ``Dick Gregory was good to deal with me and he put a lot of
money into this hotel while he was here,'' Ridgeway said. ``I have
no hard feelings for him. It was just a deal he couldn't do.''
   A spokeswoman for Dick Gregory's Health and Nutrition Institute
said Thursday that he was unavailable for comment.

   Ingmar Bergman's production of a
Japanese play hasn't gone before the critics yet, but it already
has been invited to go on the road.
   The famed director opens ``The Marquise de Sade,'' by Japanese
playwright Yukio Mishima, on April 8 at the Royal Dramatic Theater,
after he scrapped plans to stage Shakespeare's ``A Winter's Tale.''
   The play, with an all-female cast, has received invitations so
far from Tokyo and Denmark, theater spokesman Leif Ostman said
Thursday.
   ``Bergman is such a giant in the world that of course they are
pulling at his sleeve,'' Ostman said.
   At 70, Bergman has retired from filmmaking. Last April he
produced Eugene O'Neill's ``A Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' at
the Dramatic Theater, the same stage where it had its world
premiere 32 years earlier.

   When Mayor Frank Priore learned recently
that his driver's license expired in 1987, he did more than rush to
have it renewed. He suspended himself for one day without pay.
   ``I think that was the fairest thing I could do with myself,''
Priore said Wednesday.
   Priore said he didn't realize he had been driving illegally
until he was contacted by a reporter. As head of the city's police
department, he said he had to set an example. So he went to the
police chief and told him to write him a ticket.
   ``He was kind of shocked,'' Priore said. ``He said, `I can't
give you a ticket,' and I said, `You're being ordered to give me a
ticket.'''
   Priore said he decided not to be lenient on himself. A police
officer driving with an expired license would be suspended for a
day without pay, so he decided he should face the same penalty,
Priore said.
   He'll work through the suspension one day next week, but will
dock his pay $231, Priore said, adding that the ticket cost him $20.
   Priore said he decided not to send himself to jail because he
didn't deliberately let the license expire. He said the notice to
renew probably was sent to his former address.

   When Burns learned that Ron Adkins was waging a write-in

   ``I chickened out,'' he said.
   But it was too late for him to remove his name from the ballot.
He said that didn't matter because he would not win the election.
   ``I don't have to worry about that because nobody likes me down

   Finding candidates for the non-paying city positions is not
always easy, Burns said.
   ``They pretty near have to appoint somebody to take the job.''

   A Cuban family stranded in Canada by
immigration problems since December will not be allowed to return
to their home in Miami while their application for asylum is
pending, federal officials said Thursday.
   Benedict Ferro, district director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said he has denied a bid for humanitarian
parole for Carlos Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida Zamora-Powers, and
her two children, Yoradlys Diaz and Yoandys Diaz.
   The decision was the result of new information immigration
officials uncovered about the family, Ferro said. ``In this case,
the negative aspects (of granting a parole) far outweighed the
evidence on their behalf,'' he said.
   Ferro would not elaboratem, but said the decision was separate
from the family's asylum claim, which will be decided in a few
weeks.
   The family have been stranded in Ontario since Dec. 23, when
they crossed into Niagara Falls to view the Canadian falls and were
denied permission to return to the United States because of what
officials said is a history of immigration fraud.
   Their plight has drawn national attention, with Hispanic groups
and Florida lawmakers appealing to INS officials for their return.
   Although they were illegal aliens, they lived for several years
in Miami, where they owned a home and boat-building business and
were active in community affairs.
   Last month, Fajardo sought a special dispensation to return to
the United States while the application for political asylum was
being considered. The process takes several months and Fajardo said
he wanted his children to return to school and that he needed to
tend to his business.
   The family lives in Fort Erie, Ontario, under the care of
refugee assistance groups.
   ``They've been holding out hope that the decision would be
positive,'' said Sister Margaret Quinn of the Niagara Inter-Church
Refugee Committee. ``They've been going on that strength. Now this
will be a real disappointment.''
   Sister Margaret said the children have been attending school but
have language problems. She said Fajardo and his wife, who are
prevented from working in Canada, were bored.
   Fajardo said Thursday he was unsure of why INS officials had
denied the parole and that he was hoping his lawyer could explain
the decision.

<TEXT>
   A government official Thursday
accused ethnic Albanians of trying to stage an armed uprising in a
southern province and said authorities had seized weapons and
explosives.
   Stane Dolanc, vice president of Yugoslavia's collective state
presidency, said the ``separatists'' want to force Kosovo to secede
from Yugoslavia.
   Riots in Kosovo, an autonomous province in the republic of
Serbia, broke out Monday and Tuesday after legislators approved
constitutional changes giving Serbian officials greater control
over the region.
   The Belgrade newspaper Vecernje Novosti said 29 people died in
the unrest. The state-run Tanjug news agency put the death toll at
27, while Kosovo officials said 23 died and more than 200 were
injured.
   The province, under a dusk-to-dawn curfew, was quiet Thursday.
   Serbs contend the constitutional changes, which took effect
Tuesday, are necessary to protect Kosovo's Slav minority from the
ethnic Albanian majority, who make up 85 percent of the 1.9 million
population.
   Ethnic Albanians claim the changes threaten autonomy they won
under Yugoslavia's 1974 constitution.
   Dolanc, in a speech to the state Parliament in his native
republic of Slovenia, said documents seized by police in Kosovo
revealed the ``true aims'' of ethnic Albanian ``separatists'':
secession from Yugoslavia.
   ``An open call was made for armed revolt, as supported by the
fact that a large amount of explosives, weapons and other war
material was seized'' in Kosovo, Dolanc said.
   Dolanc was the federal Interior Minister in 1981, when riots by
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo killed nine people.
   There have been frequent allegations since then that Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians have organized an underground movement that seeks
to separate the region from Yugoslavia and unite it with
neighboring Albania. Ethnic Albanians deny it.
   The Slovene Communist Party daily Delo took the unusual step of
publishing what it said were casualty figures from an emigre
Albanian group in Brussels. Those figures listed 137 dead and 370
injured Monday and Tuesday.
   ``I can guarantee to you that this is a lie,'' Dolanc said.
   There were persistent reports in Pristina, Kosovo's capital,
that up to 150 ethnic Albanian intellectuals were detained or
questioned by police.
   The Belgrade daily Borba said ``intellectuals who have long been
known to act from hostile positions of Albanian nationalism and
separatism have been detained, or isolated.''
   In addition to the ethnic problems, Kosovo is Yugoslavia's
poorest region. It has an unemployment rate of 30 percent, compared
with the nationwide rate of 15 percent.

<TEXT>
   A government official said
Thursday the Czech government has asked for the extradition of two
teen-agers who hijacked a Hungarian airliner and forced it to fly
from Prague to Frankfurt.
   The extradition request would be ``very carefully considered''
before it will be acted upon, said Peter Rothen, a spokesman for
the Foreign Ministry in Bonn.
   The state-run Czech news agency CTK reported the extradition
request was delivered to the West German Embassy in Prague, the
Czech capital.
   Rothen, citing a 1970 international agreement on aircraft
hijacking, of which West Germany and Czechoslovakia are a party,
said the agreement stipulates only that hijackers will be
prosecuted.
   ``It will definitely take some time. This is a decision that
must be very carefully considered,'' Rothen said in an interview.
   The CTK reports identified the youths as Stefan Macicko, 17, and
Dusan Styk, 16, both of Banska Bystrica in Czechoslovakia. The two,
armed with a sawed-off shotgun, rifle and fake hand grenade,
commandeered the aircraft in Prague on Wednesday.
   They got aboard the jetliner after seizing a woman hostage and
crashing through a glass wall at the VIP lounge in Prague. The
woman was released shortly thereafter.
   The incident ended less than three hours later when they
surrendered after the plane landed at Frankfurt airport. No
injuries were reported.
   Officials have said the hijackers initially wanted to go to the
United States but changed their minds when the crew convinced them
the Soviet-made Tupolev-154 jet could not make the trip across the
Atlantic.
   The hijackers released 82 passengers, including all women and
children, before the airliner left Prague.
   In Budapest, the state-run MTI news agency reported the Malev
airlines jet returned to the Hungarian capital with the crew of
four and Hungarian consul-general Lajos Taba.
   Taba traded himself to the hijackers Wednesday to gain the
release of all but 11 passengers before the plane left Prague.
   Prosecutor's spokesman Hubert Harth, when asked if the youths
applied for political asylum in West Germany, responded: ``I don't
know if they asked for asylum. Our main concern is dealing with the
criminal act of hijacking.''
   Harth said they appeared in juvenile court and were told of the
charges against them.

   A federal appeals court today upheld the
conviction of eight people for helping Central Americans enter the
country illegally.
   The 1986 trial was the first major federal prosecution of
sanctuary workers, members of a church-based movement to give
refuge to immigrants from strife-torn Central American countries.
   In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
the eight, including five members of the clergy, had no right to
offer as a defense their religious beliefs or their belief that the
aliens were entitled to political asylum.
   ``A rule which would allow (the defendants) essentially to put
Reagan administration foreign policy on trial would be foolish,''
said Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall.
   The U.S. government offers asylum only to those who can prove
political persecution. Most applicants from El Salvador and
Guatemala are turned down.
   The eight were convicted in Tucson, Ariz., on charges including
conspiracy and harboring and transporting illegal aliens. All were
placed on probation.
   Several other defendants were acquitted, pleaded guilty to
misdemeanors or had charges dismissed.
   Hall said the activists' claims that enforcement of the
immigration laws infringed on their religious beliefs was
outweighed by the government's ``overriding concern in policing its
borders.''

British Embassy in anger Thursday, complaining of maltreatment
during a 26-hour sit-in protesting police restrictions on their
activities.
   An escaped detainee remained at the U.S. Consulate in
Johannesburg, a day after he eluded guards at a hospital where he
was on a hunger strike.
   Prominent anti-apartheid church leaders, including Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, conferred with Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok about the fate of the estimated 250 activists who
remain detained without charge, including up to 50 reportedly on
hunger strikes.
   ``I expect some action in the next few days,'' said the Rev.
Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African Council of
Churches, who joined Tutu and two other clergymen in urging Vlok to
free all detainees.
   The six former detainees who entered the British Embassy in
Pretoria on Wednesday expressed bitterness at Britain's refusal to
provide them with food, water and mattresses or to allow use of
toilets and telephones during their stay in an entrance hall. They
also said they would defy restrictions imposed on them following
their release from jail.
   Lawyers for the six said South African authorities had given
assurances the activists would not be arrested if they left the
embassy. No assurances were given that restrictions would be
lifted, the lawyers said.
   Scores of detainees released following recent widespread hunger
strikes have been placed under restrictions, barring them from
political activities, confining them to their homes at night, and
requiring them to report twice daily to police stations.
   British officials made clear from the start they disapproved of
the activists' protest and asked them to leave. The six requested
Britain to pressure South African authorities to lift all
restrictions on former detainees, and the embassy replied that
Britain could make effective representations only if the sit-in
ended.
   Tutu expressed disappointment at Britain's handling of the
protest, saying: ``I would have hoped they behaved in a way that
showed they cared about the welfare of people.''
   The National Union of Mineworkers, an anti-apartheid black
union, described Britain's stance as ``shocking and inhuman.''
   ``Denying them facilities necessary for human habitation
confirms our long-held views that apartheid repression is fully
supported by the British government for the realization of super
profits accruing from their sanction-busting companies in South
Africa,'' the union said.
   The protest coincided with a visit to neighboring Zimbabwe by
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who urged negotiations to
resolve South Africa's racial conflict.
   Simon Ntombela, 27, remained in the U.S. Consulate in a
Johannesburg office building after escaping Wednesday from a
hospital in Durban, 360 miles away. Ntombela, a black teacher and
anti-apartheid organizer, reportedly took a commercial flight to
Johannesburg.
   The Human Rights Commission, a private group, said Ntombela was
seeking unconditional freedom for all detainees. Before his escape,
he had been on a hunger strike for two weeks.
   The government said Wednesday it would place hunger strikers in
prison or in hospitals in Bloemfontein, a relatively remote
provincial center, to prevent escapes and publicity about them.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varying
periods under a state of emergency declared in June 1986 to quell
unrest in black townships.

   When members of the Albany Recorder Ensemble
get together Saturday, they will be playing a centuries-old song on
their ancient, flute-like instruments in unison with musicians
around the world.
   Recorder players from Argentina to Australia are being asked to
synchronize their watches and play an old English dance tune, ``The
Night Watch,'' to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the American
Recorder Society. In the Eastern time zone, the downbeat will come
at 5 p.m. Saturday.
   ``The old saying that there's strength in numbers will be
felt,'' Tim King, director of the seven-member Albany group, said
Wednesday. ``This will give us an opportunity to share with people
all over the world in a common event.''
   The recorder has a whistle mouthpiece, a thumb hole and seven
finger holes, and has a soft, reedy tone. Invented during the
Middle Ages, they have remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of
years and were particularly popular during the 16th and 17th
centuries.
   Modern flutes overtook the recorder in the 18th century, but
since the 1920s there has been a revival of interest, and the
American Recorder Society now 4,200 has members worldwide.
   Andy Green, the society's administrative director, said
recorders are popular because they don't take a lot of skill to
produce pleasing music.
   ``It means that people who are involved in other things for the
major part of their lives can still make music and in some cases
even play great music,'' he said in a telephone interview from the
group's New York headquarters.
   Green said it's hard to predict how many will take part in the
play-in, but judging from preliminary reports, they will number in
the thousands, most of them amateurs.
   When the time comes Saturday, ARS President Martha Bixler, a
nationally known recorder performer, will give the downbeat for
hundreds of players assembled in New York's Symphony Space theater.
   The society has taken pains to see to it that recorder players
elsewhere _whether in groups or in their homes _ will be playing
along in unison, or as close to it as possible.
   Along with copies of ``The Night Watch,'' the society has mailed
instructions including starting times in various time zones _ late
evening in Europe, Sunday morning in the Far East _ and urging
participants to ``be sure to sychronize your watch to the second
with the radio or the time telephone number.'' They also give a
suggested metronome tempo.
   Green called the mass play-in Saturday ``a celebration not only
of the recorder society, but of ... amateur musicians playing
together and the importance of this in our lives.''
   John Curtis, a college professor in Valdosta who directs the
16-member Valdosta Recorder Society, said the low cost of recorders
adds to their popularity. Good plastic instruments sell for about
$20, though the finest wooden recorders can cost hundreds of
dollars.
   ``It's a sort of personal hobby thing,'' said Curtis, a college
professor. ``Every month, we discover one or two more folks who
like to play.''

<HEAD>17-Year-Old Ordered Back To Alabama To Face Murder Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Thursday ordered a 17-year-old
prisoner sent back to Alabama to face a murder charge and possible
death sentence, rejecting claims that the move could violate this
city's ban on capital punishment.
   Superior Court Judge Stephen F. Eilperin said turning down
Alabama's extradition request would make the District of Columbia
ban ``into national policy and turn the District into a haven for
persons wanted by other states on capital charges.''
   The judge gave Alabama authorities until May 1 to pick up the
defendant, identified only by the initials O.M. He and an uncle are
charged with murder and arson in the May 1988 firebombing of a
Gasden, Ala., apartment. Tamel Jackson, 18 months, died in the
incident.
   Eilperin postponed the effective date of his order until Tuesday
to give defense attorneys time to appeal. He rejected their bid for
a 30-day stay.
   The judge said he could find no legal basis for allowing states
to reject extradition requests they view as morally offensive,
including ones that could subject defendants to capital punishment.
   Even if such discretion existed, he said, Alabama could get
around it by certifying O.M. for trial as an adult, since the
Supreme Court has ruled clearly that states have no such power in
handling adult extradition requests.
   ``A decision by the Alabama courts to treat O.M. as an adult
could be returned in his absence and would be binding on this
court,'' Eilperin said.
   Eilperin said the district cannot ``interpose its objection to
capital punishment between O.M. and Alabama.''
   ``Alabama is entitled to have Alabama law govern criminal acts
committed on Alabama soil, by citizens of Alabama, against citizens
of Alabama,'' he said.
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule in July whether imposing
the death penalty on defendants who committed murder before age 18
violates the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual
punishment.
   O.M.'s lawyers also had contended that the defendant, who is
black, cannot receive a fair trial from white Etowah County, Ala.,
authorities. They cited the death of his father in 1978 and his
uncle in 1984, both while in the custody of local authorities.
   Eilperin acknowledged that testimony from the youth, his
grandmother and his friends in Gadsden had depicted ``a dismal
climate of summary execution, illegal jailings and harassment.''
   But he said the law requires that fair trial claims be raised in
Alabama, not the district.
   ``Courts do not sit to make moral judgments loosed from law,''
he said. ``And while legislative bodies may act on their moral
perceptions, there are limits to their powers, especially local
bodies such as the district's City Council.
   ``Nothing in the Constitution or elsewhere grants the District
of Columbia the power to enforce beyond its borders the district's
moral opposition to the death penalty,'' he said.
   O.M. was arrested by District authorities in December and has
been fighting extradition ever since.

<HEAD>More Closing of Military Bases May Be Sought as Money-Saving Move</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday he
might ask Congress to close more military bases as a money-saving
move in efforts ``to try to create a leaner, more efficient''
structure for America's armed forces.
   Cheney, in his first lengthy Pentagon interview since taking
office March 17, said a base-closing initiative undertaken last
year by the Reagan administration was ``a hell of an idea'' but
``obviously a first-time effort.''
   ``We may well want to go further and start again,'' he said.
   ``While I understand the problems that some of my former
colleagues (in Congress) face _ individual situations in their
districts _ I just have to believe that there are opportunities for
economies in reviewing a base structure that has been basically
unchanged for 50 or 60 years,'' said the former congressman from
Wyoming.
   ``I'm not ready to make an announcement today,'' he continued.
   ``But I think if you're going to look at finding ways to
maintain the nation's defenses with less money ... then I have no
choice as secretary but to look for ways to save money. And one of
those ways is to close bases that aren't necessary, to consolidate
operations and to try to create a leaner, more efficient
infrastructure for our military forces.''
   Cheney also said it was much too premature to discuss the
withdrawal of American troops from Europe, given the absence of
progress in conventional arms control talks with the Warsaw Pact.
   In addition, he said he wanted to do everything possible to
provide military support to authorities fighting the drug trade but
didn't want to see soldiers being used as policemen, and agreed he
had no magic answer to dealing with Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   The situation involving Noriega is a problem the Bush
administration inherited from the Reagan administration, which
tried unsuccessfully to pressure Noriega to step down after he was
indicted on drug charges in the United States.
   ``I don't know that I've got any light I can shed on the Noriega
problem,'' Cheney said in the interview with wire service reporters.
   ``It obviously is a continuing problem. It's something this
administration inherited from our predecessors. But I don't have
anything this morning that I can give you by way of new policy or a
new idea.''
   Asked if he had any reason to think that elections in Panama
could be conducted democratically, he replied: ``There's always
hope. Chicago's been reformed, why not Panama?''
   Cheney also said that philosophically he had no problem with
applying the death penalty in serious cases of peacetime espionage.
Several arrests have been made in recent months in spy cases that
have been described as potentially serious enough to justify a
prosecution request for capital punishment.
   Cheney also said he couldn't support any type of compulsory
``national service'' plan for Americans when they turn 18, but
wouldn't object to a carefully crafted, voluntary plan that
recognized the need to staff the all-volunteer military.
   In addition, he said he and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., would simply
have to disagree about the role of top military officers in dealing
with Congress.
   Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
criticized Cheney on Wednesday for scolding the Air Force's top
general for consulting privately with congressional leaders on
missile programs. Aspin argued that contacts between Congress and
the military are ``not adequate as it is.''
   Cheney responded Thursday he considered Aspin a close friend,
but hadn't changed his mind about having civilian executives handle
such consultations.
   Cheney also said he had received several greetings from foreign
defense ministers, including the one from the Soviet Union, since
taking office. Cheney said he thought it would be useful to meet
the Soviet defense chief, but that nothing was scheduled.
   The base-closing initiative began last year with an independent
commission crafting a plan to close 86 installations, most of them
relatively small, and to partially close five others for a
projected savings of $5.6 billion over 20 years.
   Despite some opposition, those closures appear likely. Opponents
do not appear to have the votes needed in Congress to block the
plan.

<HEAD>Social Service Agencies Awarded Grants From Settlement Fund</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight agencies serving Vietnam veterans and
their families were awarded grants Thursday from settlement of a
suit by veterans who claimed exposure to Agent Orange gave them
cancer and other illnesses.
   The programs will provide a wide range of services, with
emphasis placed on helping veterans' children who have birth
defects and other disabilities.
   Among the recipients was an agency that offers legal advice to
disadvantaged Vietnam veterans in San Francisco, another that
enables veterans to participate in the Outward Bound program and a
housing program in New Mexico for the families of veterans
receiving treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.
   The eight grants, totalling $581,000, are the first of many to
be allocated from a $52 million fund. The fund is expected to grow
with interest to $70 million during the seven- to 10-year life of
the program.
   The money is part of a $240 million settlement of a class action
suit brought more than 10 years ago by veterans who claimed
exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange during the Vietnam war
caused cancer, birth defects in their children and other illnesses.
   The chemical was sprayed over Southeast Asia during the 1960s by
the U.S. military, which hoped to deprive communist troops of crops
and cover.
   A large portion of the settlement, $170 million, has been
allocated to the Agent Orange Veteran Payment Program, which
provides cash payments to totally disabled Vietnam veterans and to
the widows or children of veterans who died. Distribution of these
payments began earlier this month.
   The Agent Orange Class Assistance Program, from which the grants
are being awarded, was designed to reach veterans and their
families who do not meet the eligibility requirements for direct
payments.
   Settlement of the lawsuit, brought in 1978, was reached in 1984
on the eve of trial in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y., when
the veterans and defendants _ seven manufacturers of Agent Orange _
agreed to the terms. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the settlement
last June.
   Dennis Rhoades, executive director of the assistance program,
said at a news conference that special attention would be made to
fund programs that are innovative and that can strengthen a network
of services for Vietnam veterans and their families after the
settlement fund is exhausted.
   He described the eight grants awarded Thursday as ``flagship
grants'' that would form the basis of the program's direction.
   Because of concern expressed by veterans about children with
birth defects and other developmental disabilities, Rhoades said
those areas would be given the highest priority in funding.
   The eight organizations receiving grants were:
   _The Federation for Children with Special Needs in Boston,
$50,000 for a program of training and networking of Vietnam
families with disabled children.
   _The Occupational Center of Essex County, N.J., $71,000 for a
program of respite care for severely disabled children of Vietnam
veterans.
   _The National Handicapped Sports Association in Bethesda, Md.,
$64,000 for a program of outdoor recreational training for disabled
children of Vietnam veterans.
   _The Team of Advocates for Special Kids in Fountain Valley,
Calif., $61,000 for an advocacy training and referral program for
veterans' families of disabled children.
   _Swords to Plowshares of San Francisco, $90,000 for a legal
advocacy program for disadvantaged Vietnam veterans.
   _The American Red Cross Chapter in Albuquerque, N.M., $95,000
for a program of housing and other support for the families of
veterans receiving treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.
   _The Family Services Association of Green Bay, Wis., $55,000 for
a counseling program.
   _The Paralyzed Veterans of America in Washington, D.C., $95,000
for a program allowing Vietnam veterans being treated for
post-traumatic stress disorder to participate in the Outward Bound
wilderness experience.

   The Navy, finally resolving a four-year
dispute involving what it described as a matter of high national
security, has authorized the Commerce Department to begin
publishing detailed maps of the ocean floors surrounding the United
States.
   The decision, announced Thursday, means that ``most'' of the
detailed ocean-bottom maps of the so-called Exclusive Economic Zone
produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
will soon be declassified and released to the public, the Navy said.
   The only maps the Navy said it will continue to insist remain
classified ``Secret'' are those covering ``egress routes'' used by
ballistic missile submarines sailing from their home ports.
   There are four such home ports on the East and West coasts of
the United States for nuclear missile submarines: Groton, Conn.;
Charleston, S.C.; Kings Bay, Ga., and Bangor, Wash.
   ``The threat assessment and decision-making for this issue have
been a long, difficult task,'' Rear Adm. R.F. Pittenger wrote in a
letter last month to the Commerce Department, NOAA's parent agency.
   ``Of particular interest to you, the Navy now interposes no
objection to unclassified release of most of the NOAA
high-resolution bathymetry data which is controlled under the White
House-National Security Advisor memorandum of Jan. 7, 1985.
   ``All present and future NOAA data from the U.S. Exclusive
Economic Zone may be released except in broad areas _ to be defined
_ around SSBN (missile submarine) egress routes.''
   Pittenger, the oceanographer of the Navy, sent his letter to
Commerce Under Secretary Dr. William E. Evans on March 23. The Navy
released copies on Thursday.
   The dispute now being resolved involves an effort by NOAA and
various universities to use a new, extremely sophisticated ``Sea
Beam'' sonar mapping system to produce incredibly detailed maps _
almost like black-and-white photos _ of the ocean bottom.
   NOAA is trying to survey the entire Exclusive Economic Zone,
which runs from 12 miles to 200 miles off the U.S. coast. Within
that zone, the United States asserts control when it comes to such
economic development activities as fishing, mining and oil drilling.
   The NOAA maps are likely to prove invaluable to the oil and gas
industry and companies that lay cables on the sea floor. Fisherman
could use them to locate areas where fish congregate, and
eventually the maps could help companies mine strategic minerals.
   The Navy, however, saw another danger _ detailed maps of the
ocean bottom along America's coast would be particularly useful to
commanders of Soviet submarines _ both those trying to hunt or
attack American subs as well as those trying to ``fix'' their
position to launch a missile attack.
   In January 1985, the issue came to a head with the White House
giving the Navy the authority to block NOAA's publication of
ocean-bottom maps.
   Ever since, NOAA has been collecting the map data with the sonar
system but holding back its release at the Navy's insistence.
   ``NOAA has surveyed much of the EEZ, and the data has been
classified `Secret,''' the Navy said Thursday. ``Most of the data
can soon be declassified and maps can be produced for public
release (under this decision).''
   Stan Eames, a spokesman for NOAA, declined immediate comment
Thursday on the Navy's announcement, but Navy officials said they
understood that NOAA executives were pleased with the decision.
   As part of the ruling, the Navy did decide Thursday the sonar
technology used to produce the maps would continue to be listed on
the Pentagon's ``Munitions List,'' meaning it is subject to export
controls.
   ``This will allow U.S. exports only to countries that will
guarantee no re-export to east bloc nations,'' the Navy said.

<TEXT>
   Patched in white limestone bandages,
the Sphinx had a head-to-toe checkup Thursday by antiquities
officials, and the prognosis was mixed.
   ``The Sphinx is in no danger of collapsing,'' Minister of
Culture Farouk Hosni said after a 45-minute detailed examination of
the monument with the face of a pharaoh and the body of a lion.
   He admitted its problems are severe, however, and said Egypt is
willing to listen to any suggestions on how to solve them.
   ``The Sphinx belongs to Egypt, but even if someone on the moon
has a suggestion that would help us, we will listen,'' he said.
   Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization,
predicted it would take at least a year before a team of
international and local experts can agree on a permanent solution
to the 4,600-year-old monument's lingering ills.
   The tour by Hosni, Tawfik and others was to counter local press
reports that a year-long emergency restoration effort has failed to
stop deterioration.
   ``The talk that the restoration work is bad was made only to
cause a crisis,'' Hosni said. ``These are personal rivalries, and I
don't want them to interfere with scientific work.''
   Officials have known for years that the Sphinx, fashioned from
layers of limestone piled on a natural knoll, was in trouble. In
February 1988, a chunk of rock tumbled from its right shoulder, and
the patchup began.
   Restorers encased a critically weak portion of the endangered
shoulder behind a limestone retaining wall. Limestone blocks have
been placed alongside the body as braces.
   It's the clash of the bright white limestone against ancient
brown stone that causes visitors to say the Sphinx just doesn't
look the same. Hosni said he's determined to find a balance between
the subtle beauty the ancients built into the sculpture with the
need to save it by introducing modern touches.
   UNESCO, the United Nations' education and scientific agency, has
given $100,000 for equipment to monitor harmful natural and
man-made phenomena like pollution and wind. The antiquities
organization's Tawfik said discussions for technical help are under
with with the Getty Conservation Institute of Marina Del Ray,
Calif., and the Smithsonian Institution.
   ``This rock has been sick ever since it was hewn. There's been
repair and restoration work for thousands of years,'' Hosni said.
``Under the pharaohs, under the Romans, under subsequent reigns,
we've been trying to restore this rock because it is not firm. It
has been affected by erosion, by atmosphere, climate or by
subterranean waters.''
   Hosni said antiquities officials are trying to protect the relic
as its builders did, without using cement.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``Nothing we have done cannot be
reversed.''
   Tawfik noted that the Sphinx's Arabic name is Abu el-Hawl,
``Father of Terror,'' and said experts remain terrified.
   ``Scholars are afraid to do anything to harm the wonderful
beast,'' he said. ``Any international expert is at once faced with
the idea he may cause danger to one of the world's most famous
monuments.''
   Tawfik described the work done so far as patchwork.
   Once the conclusions are in, he said, ``We'll take the greatest
step ever for the Sphinx, to restore it as a whole. But it will
require restoration forever. Doctors will have to feed him what he
needs now and then.''
   Omar el-Arini, the U.S. Embassy's science officer, said the
Sphinx must be considered 50 million years old.
   ``That's how old the rocks are that made the Sphinx,'' he said.
``The Sphinx is living rock, and it's suffering from old age.''
   Tourists will get used to its new look, el-Arini said. ``The
Sphinx has had many looks,'' he said. ``It had one look when it was
built. A thousand years later it had another. Most of the time it
was buried in sand.
   ``Another generation of tourists won't remember how the Sphinx
looked to those who came before.''
   The important thing, he said, is to keep it standing. Or rather
sitting.

<HEAD>New Outcry on Airport Security After Explosives Found on Jet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new furor over airport security broke out
Thursday after the discovery that a British Airways jet flew with
an explosive aboard for at least two weeks because police on a
bomb-detection drill forgot to remove it.
   The gelignite was tucked in a seat pocket in economy class of
the Boeing 747, news reports said Wednesday night. Authorities
would not say when the gelignite was put on the plane.
   The incident was particularly embarrassing to British officials
trying to tighten security following the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The Air Transport Users Committee, a consumer group, called it
``the sort of carelessness we can't afford.''
   Lawmaker David Wilshire of the governing Conservative Party said
the public was always being told British Airways was among the most
security-minded airlines.
   ``My mind boggles at the thought of what airlines in Timbuktu
are like if this is the best,'' he said. ``The worst must be
mind-blowingly incompetent.''
   The chairman of British Airways, Lord King, said the explosives
worked their way through the upholstery and that a cleaner found
them Monday after the jet returned to Heathrow Airport from Toronto.
   Police Inspector Andrew Nielson said the gelignite weighed less
than a pound and was four inches long and less than an inch wide.
He said the substance had no detonator, could not explode by itself
and ``at the very worst it could flare up if ignited by fire.''
   King said even if the substance posed no danger, ``that's not
the point. It might have been something that was dangerous.'' He
promised an investigation, adding, ``If heads fall, they fall.''
   The explosives were brought aboard the plane to test security
but overlooked by police dogs trained to search for bombs,
according to authorities.
   Scotland Yard said an agreement with British Airways permits the
occasional use of its planes for dog training, and King said he
would ``think twice'' about allowing the arrangement to continue.
   Asked who was to blame, King said, ``The police say they are
responsible for it being there. I am responsible for the airline
and whatever it's involved in _ we don't stand back from that.''
   Transport Minister Lord Brabazon said he contacted the chief
executive of British Airways, Colin Marshall, to express concern
over the incident, which was being investigated by police.
   Asked why the police did not count the explosives before and
after the bomb-detection drill, Brabazon said: ``That does seem
rather odd, I agree.''
   Lawmaker John Prescott of the opposition Labor Party expressed
shock that the incident occurred after a spate of security lapses,
despite repeated government insistence on tightened security.
   ``We are now the laughing stock of the world, when we used to be
the best,'' the Evening Standard quoted him as saying.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon is under fire for alleged
laxity in informing airlines of suspected bomb plots before Flight
103, which originated in Frankfurt and stopped at Heathrow, blew
up. The explosion, blamed on a terrorist bomb, killed all 259
people aboard the jet and 11 on the ground.
   In mid-January, two journalists, working independent of each
other, reported they obtained cleaning jobs at Heathrow Airport
using fake names.
   One of them, a television reporter, was filmed carrying a dummy
parcel into the cockpit of a Japan Air Lines plane.
   On Feb. 14, Pan Am suspended its cleaning company after a
reporter said he gave false details of his identity and could have
planted a bomb aboard planes while working for the firm.
   Last week, three youths in ski masks sneaked aboard an empty
British Airways jumbo jet in a maintenance area at Heathrow,
photographed their escapade, and gave the videotape to a television
network.

   The Moslem cleric slain in his Brussels
office had been threatened with death for opposing Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's order that author Salman Rushdie be killed as a
blasphemer, officials said Thursday.
   Vice Premier Willy Claes said Abdullah Ahdal, who was killed
Wednesday, got telephone threat March 24 because of his
disagreement with Khomeini's death sentence on the Indian-born
British novelist for writing ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain since Khomeini issued the
proclamation Feb. 14.
   Claes said ``the Islamic world is deeply divided'' by Khomeini's
execution order, which Iranian clerics accompanied with a reward of
$5.2 million, and the threat ``clearly referred to the moderate
viewpoints'' Ahdal had expressed.
   He did not exclude other motives for the murder, however. No one
has claimed responsibility.
   Britain offered to help find the killers. ``I stand ready to
offer any assistance which may be necessary to track down those who
perpetrated this foul crime,'' Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said in
a letter to Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet.
   Police strengthened border security and said they had no leads.
   Sources reported tension among Belgium's 225,000 Moslems on the
Rushdie issue and said Ahdal had argued hours before the murder
with some who disagreed with him.
   Ahdal had been in Belgium for six years and directed of the
Moslem World League in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The
league, based in Mecca, is a moderate Islamic institution.
   The 36-year-old Saudi national was shot to death in his office
at the city's main mosque along with Salem Behir, the mosque
librarian. Behir, 48, was a Tunisian.
   Police said they were shot at close range with single shots to
the head and chest, with no signs of a struggle. Ahdal was on the
telephone when he was shot, they said.
   In a Belgian TV interview on Feb. 20, six days after the Iranian
patriarch ordered Rushdie killed, Ahdal agreed ``The Satanic
Verses'' was blasphemous but said of the death sentence:
   ``One should not have done that. Rushdie should have first
appeared (before an Islamic tribunal). He should have explained
himself, defended himself. He should have been asked to repent.''
   In democratic societies ``everyone has the right to speak his
thoughts, to express himself as he wants,'' he said.
   At a meeting of theologians last month in Mecca, the holy city
of Islam, the Moslem World League said Rushdie's book was
blasphemous did not support Khomeini's death sentence.
   Elements of the book that offend Moslems include a brothel scene
in which prostitutes take the names of Mohammed's wives and the
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it from Allah.
   Rushdie, 41, was born in Bombay to Moslem parents but has said
he no longer practices religion.
   ``Because of the attack, protection measures for members of the
Islamic community were immediately increased,'' Claes said,
including more frequent police patrols near mosques and protection
for Moslem leaders.
   He said Ahdal was offered increased protection after the threat
March 24 but refused it.
   Claes joined Islamic leaders in urging Moslems in Belgium to
remain calm.
   Sheik Ibrahim Bakr, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Brussels, asked
Moslems to refrain from violence and ``have confidence in Belgian
justice.''
   He said Ahdal ``exemplified the young tolerant, moderate Moslem
who sacrificed his life to serve Islam.''

   Israel's Arabs staged a general
strike and rallies Thursday in support of the uprising in the
occupied territories, where three Palestinians were reported killed
during ``Land Day'' protests.
   Arab reports said 31 Palestinians were wounded in the occupied
West Bank, while the army put the figure at 24.
   Despite heavy security and a curfew that confined all 650,000
residents of the Gaza Strip to their homes, violent clashes erupted
in towns and refugee camps throughout the territories to mark the
13th anniversary of a bloody clash over Israeli confiscation of
Arab land.
   The army sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, barring
Palestinians from entering Israel and posted thousands of troops in
the occupied lands.
   Rallies in northern Israel by thousands of Israeli Arabs in
support of the Palestinian revolt generally went off peacefully,
but police arrested 20 Arabs for possessing pro-uprising leaflets
believed to incite violence.
   Arab Affairs Minister Ehud Olmert praised Israeli Arabs for
refraining from violence. ``No doubt there's a large measure of
responsibility here. They restrained themselves,'' he said on
Israel's Arabic television broadcast.
   Israeli Arabs number about one-fifth of Israel's 4.2 million
population and their involvement in demonstrations prompted fears
the uprising could spread to Israel itself.
   ``Land Day'' marks the March 30, 1976, deaths of six Arabs in an
incident at Deir Al Hanna triggered by confiscation of Arab land
for an army firing range.
   In the West Bank village of Shweike, troops shot and killed a
20-year-old Palestinian carrying a large stone as he was about to
ambush an army officer in a narrow alleyway, a military spokesman
said.
   Palestinian residents identified the dead man as Akram Saif Al
Din Khowayled. They said a 20-year-old was seriously wounded in the
stomach.
   A military spokesman said a Palestinian from the village of Al
Jib near Ramallah also died and the army was investigating. Arab
doctors identified him as Mohammed Mansour Abed Rabo, 22, and said
he was shot in the chest.
   Arab doctors in the occupied Gaza Strip said Nasr Khaled Nasr,
24, was killed by a plastic bullet to the heart during a clash with
stone-throwing youths in the Jabaliya refugee camp.
   The army said it was checking the report and added that 24
Palestinians were wounded in the West Bank.
   The deaths brought to 415 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 15-month-old revolt against Israeli occupation. Eighteen
Israelis have also died.
   Arab reporters said 17 Palestinians were wounded in the Hebron
area, including two allegedly shot by Jewish settlers near Alia
hospital.
   In the West Bank village of Yatta near Hebron, residents said
Arab guards of Mayor Ismail Ihmid opened fire on Palestinian
demonstrators who hurled stones and firebombs at city hall for
staying open in defiance of the strike.
   An army spokesman confirmed the incident, saying guards opened
fire because the protesters tried to set fire to city hall. He said
three Palestinians were wounded in the attack.
   Arab doctors said 11 Palestinians were wounded in clashes in
Arab east Jerusalem, as well as in villages and refugee camps near
Bethlehem, Ramallah, Jenin, Tulkarem and Nablus.
   Among the wounded was a 27-year-old man from a village near
Bethlehem in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head.
   The clashes in Tulkarem erupted when 40 masked men in shirts
emblazoned with the Palestinian flag marched through streets waving
the outlawed banner, the Arab reports said.
   In the Dheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem, about 200
Palestinian youths, most with their faces masked, set tires afire
and hurled stones in two hours of hit-and-run skirmishes with
soldiers on the highway.
   Arab doctors in the occupied Gaza Strip said a 36-year-old man
from the Shati refugee camp was shot in the leg.
   Arab reporters in the Gaza Strip said four houses were
demolished in Gaza City and Abassan and a room of a fifth Gaza City
home was destroyed. Residents said the homes belonged to
Palestinian activists accused of throwing firebombs at the home of
Arabs who cooperated with Israel.
   In Deir Al Hanna in northern Israel, about 10,000 Arabs filled
the town square in support of the Palestinian revolt and the
establishment of a Palestinian state in the occupied areas.
   Some demonstrators waved olive branches and raised banners in
the colors of the Palestinian flag and chanted: ``Long live the
united PLO! Yes to a Palestinian state!''
   Police kept a low profile and Arab activists with white arm
bands emblazoned with ``Security'' in red maintained order.

<HEAD>Official Outlines Pay Plan For Operator of Key Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time since its Savannah River
nuclear weapons plant was built in 1950, the Energy Department is
offering performance bonuses and a guaranteed base fee to the
plant's operator, department officials said Thursday.
   William Kaspar, manager of the department's field office at
Savannah River, near Aiken, S.C., outlined the payment plan to a
group of experts advising Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on
safety issues involving the department's nuclear weapons
facilities, which includes 16 major sites in 12 states.
   The payment plan, which takes effect Saturday with the debut of
a new contractor at Savannah River, marks a significant departure
from past practice in which E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. operated
the plant for 38 years without any fees.
   Kaspar said the new plan is intended to give du Pont's successor
at Savannah River, Westinghouse Electric Corp., a financial
incentive to improve operation of the plant's three nuclear
reactors, which make materials for nuclear warheads. The site also
includes other facilities that support the nuclear weapons program.
   The three reactors have been shut down since last spring because
of safety concerns. Last week Westinghouse submitted
recommendations on how to get them running again, and their success
or failure will largely determine how much they earn on the job.
   Although Westinghouse's contract is for five years, the payment
plan can be changed each six months, Kaspar said. For the first
six-month period, Westinghouse can earn a maximum of about $7
million in performance awards and a minimum of zero, he said.
   Mark Silverman, an Energy Department official at Savannah River
who helped draft the payment plan, said in an interview that
Westinghouse would be guaranteed a fee of $750,000 for running a
naval fuel fabrication plant at the site plus $1.25 million for
managing the rest of the 300-square-mile complex.
   The performance awards would be in addition to the guaranteed
fees, Silverman said. The amounts to be offered for subsequent
six-month periods haven't been set, he said.
   Kaspar said the department's decisions on granting performance
bonuses would be based on a detailed list of tasks and standards
that place the highest priority on ``safety and quality of
operations.'' This term was chosen, he said, to give equal weight
to production performance and safety achievements.
   The Energy Department and du Pont have been heavily criticized
for putting too much emphasis on meeting production goals at the
expense of safety concerns.
   Members of the department's safety advisory group questioned
Kaspar about the strong focus on rewarding excellence, saying this
approach might lead Westinghouse to figure it can spend unlimited
amounts so long as the results are judged to be outstanding. The
company's expenses will be paid in full by the government.
   ``Right now I'm not worrying about overkill on striving for
excellence,'' Kaspar said.

<HEAD>Trident Failure Laid to Nozzle Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy believes a Trident 2 missile that
failed during a launch attempt last week suffered a mechanical
failure in the first-stage nozzle mechanism, the Pentagon said
Thursday.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said the
Navy had managed to recover some parts of the missile from the
ocean floor off Cape Canaveral, Fla., and to analyze more of the
radio telemetry data from the launch.
   ``They have determined from the telemetry at this point that the
difficulty was not with the guidance system or any of the
electrical systems,'' Howard said.
   ``The most likely suspect is a mechanical failure in the nozzle
mechanism.''
   The Navy's investigation began March 21, shortly after a Trident
2 missile fired from the submarine Tennessee self-destructed just
four seconds after launch. The missile popped to the surface as
planned and the first stage ignited properly, but then the missile
began spinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded.
   It was the first submarine launch of the Navy's newest and most
powerful weapon.
   According to Howard, the first-stage rocket nozzles of the
missile are supposed to swivel immediately after firing to put the
weapon on a 19-degree angle of flight. Then, another internal
command is sent to the nozzles to straighten back up, thus
maintaining the 19-degree flight angle.
   In this case, the spokesman says, the nozzles never straightened
back up after the second command and it appears the cause was
mechanical.
   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon
that is the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident
1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to
individual targets up to 6,000 miles away.
   The Navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its
undersea predecessors _ Polaris, Poseidon and Trident 1 _ and can
match the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it
is launched from a submerged, moving submarine.
   The Tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry
24 of the deadly missiles.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Chappell Dies of Cancer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William V. Chappell, an influential
congressman who lost his House seat last year amid questions about
whether he was tied to the pentagon procurement scandal, died
Thursday. He was 67.
   Chappell, a Democrat who had represented the 4th District in
northeast Florida, died at the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md. He was hospitalized Feb. 23 for treatment of bone
cancer, which he had battled privately for at least three years.
   ``He fought the good fight. He never gave up and never lost his
sense of humor,'' Judith Chappell Gadd, his eldest child, said
Thursday.
   Florida political leaders praised Chappell's long public service
and defended his name, which had been linked to the Pentagon
procurement scandal.
   Chappell, of Ormond Beach, lost to Republican newcomer Craig
James of DeLand last fall by 791 votes, less than 1 percent of
those cast. Chappell challenged the outcome for a month before
conceding.
   James' campaign emphasized reports that federal agents were
investigating whether Chappell received funds diverted from defense
contractor Unisys Corp. through Armtec Inc., a small subcontractor
in Chappell's district. The Palatka manufacturer closed after its
records were seized by FBI agents in a raid June 14 and Unisys
canceled its contract.
   No criminal charges were filed against Chappell and he
vehemently denied wrongdoing.
   ``Despite how the career might have ended, he certainly was a
long-term servant of the people of Florida and I'm sure in his many
years of serving his community that he was able to bring a lot of
federal assistance to his district,'' said Gov. Bob Martinez.
   In Washington, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, called
Chappell a ``great legislator ... the kind of man we wanted to help
make them when Congress has to make tough choices. He was a
champion of a strong Navy _ going all the way back to his days as a
naval aviator in World War II.''
   Chappell was chairman of the powerful House defense
appropriations subcommittee.
   Before his 10 terms in Congress, Chappell served in the Florida
House for 10 years and was its speaker in 1961. He was a county
prosecutor from 1949 to 1954.
   The former congressman recently told an interviewer that he was
enjoying his forced retirement and was fishing and enjoying his
family.
   His wife, Jeane, kept a vigil by her husband's hospital bed, and
his four children and two stepchildren were in Bethesda when he
died.
   Services were scheduled Tuesday at churches in Daytona Beach and
Ocala.

   Flight attendants at United Airlines, upset
with stalled contract negotiations, plan a series of informational
pickets at 11 major U.S. cities served by the carrier, their union
said Thursday.
   The Association of Flight Attendants said the pickets would
begin Friday at airports in Washington, Miami, Chicago, Cleveland,
Denver, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Honolulu and Newark,
N.J.
   LaGuardia airport in New York will be added to the sites Sunday,
the union said in a statment.
   The pickets will be off-duty flight attendants and service
should not be affected, the union said.
   The union represents 13,000 United flight attendants. The union
and the airline for 19 months have been trying to negotiate a new
contract. A tentative agreement was reached in November 1987 but
was rejected by 78 percent of the union members who voted on the
proposal.
   The airline has been seeking wage and other concessions from the
union, which has argued those demands are unfair because United
posted record operating profits last year.
   The flight attendants union has authorized a strike vote against
United but will not decide for at least two weeks whether to
schedule one, a union spokeswoman said.

   Iran on Thursday ordered the Swiss consul
to leave Tehran and accused him of spying after its own consul in
Geneva was forced to leave.
   Switzerland's ambassador in Tehran, Heinrich Reimann, lodged a
formal protest after the Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned him
Thursday afternoon and told him the consul, Jakob Schranz, had to
leave, a Swiss spokesman said.
   Tehran radio said the Foreign Ministry told the ambassador that
Schranz was an ``undesirable element'' because he was involved in
``activities incompatible with his diplomatic status,'' a term used
to denote spying.
   Josef Hermann, a spokesman for the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's
office, said Iran's consul in Geneva, Manouchehr Tale-Massouleh,
``engaged in certain activities that led to his having to leave
Switzerland'' Wednesday night, but he did not elaborate.
   Reimann, whose embassy also handles U.S. interests in Tehran,
told Iranian officials the Iranian order was ``unacceptable''
because ``no real reason'' was given, Swiss Foreign Ministry
spokesman Michel Pache told reporters in Bern.
   Pache said Switzerland considered it a ``purely retaliatory
measure'' after Tale-Massouleh was forced out of the country.
   Swiss authorities wanted Tale-Massouleh to leave at the end of
February, but Iran wanted him to stay until his tour of duty
expired at the end of April, Pache said. A compromise was reached
for him to leave at the end of March, he said.
   Hermann said Swiss authorities are investigating two people
suspected of helping the Iranian diplomat gather information, but
their nationalities or whereabouts were not disclosed.
   Questions about Tale-Massouleh's activities surfaced after the
Geneva consulate was occupied for five hours Dec. 14 by six Iranian
militants who said they were protesting executions in Iran.
   At their trial in Geneva in January, they claimed documents in
the consulate showed Tale-Massouleh led efforts to spy on Iranian
refugees in Switzerland, but the diplomat denied it.
   Hermann said Swiss authorities verified ``certain points'' among
the ``very voluminous'' documentation. He did not elaborate.
   The consulate occupiers, six men aged 25 to 41, all received
four-month suspended prison sentences.

   Spencer Tracy's acting technique was simply
``less is better,'' and that helped make him the screen's greatest
actor. The Tracy credo is recommended to future producers of
Academy Award shows.
   Wednesday night's orgy of self-congratulation was dazzling,
glamorous and all those familiar Hollywood adjectives. Also too
much.
   Too many endless production numbers. Too much forced
conversation between couples. Too many awards with meaning lost to
the general public.
   The use of ``couples, co-stars, compadres and companions,'' as
presenters for the 61st Academy Awards at the Shrine Auditorium was
clever but wearing.
   The best Oscar shows have been emceed by Will Rogers, Bob Hope,
Johnny Carson and other funnymen who provided continuity as well as
a leavening of pomposity.
   The brightest moments of the 61st Awards came from Billy
Crystal, Robin Williams and Bob Hope, but they were all too brief.
   Tom Selleck remarked that Douglas Fairbanks Sr. handed out the
first awards in 1929 in five minutes. The present awards could be
staged in two hours instead of the 3 hours and 15 minutes they took
Wednesday night on ABC-TV.
   But the show will never be shorter. Reason: The time is needed
to sell all those 30-second adds at $375,000 per.
   Since the Academy Awards are a night of superlatives here are a
few more:
   The most heartfelt acceptance: Dustin Hoffman.
   The most intelligent acceptance: Jodie Foster.
   Warmest reception: Lucille Ball and Bob Hope.
   Best looking legs: Cyd Charisse.
   Second-best looking legs: Martin Short.
   Worst desecration of an icon: Snow White portrayed as a whining
would-be starlet.
   Best comedy routine: Billy Crystal imitating Yul Brynner as Babe
Ruth.
   Best walk-on music: ``The Second Time Around'' for Melanie
Griffith and Don Johnson.
   Least promising rock singer: Rob Lowe.
   Most overworked butt of jokes: Vice President Dan Quayle by
Crystal, Hope and Williams (twice).
   Most prevalent fashion: Strapless gowns.
   Seemingly endless number: ``Oscar Winners of Tomorrow.''
   Most relentless double entendre: Bo Derek and Dudley Moore.
   Most questionable taste: Kurt Russell's ``proposal'' of marriage
to Goldie Hawn.
   Most mentioned agent: Michael Ovitz of Creative Artists Agency.
   Most recurrent dance routine: The Rockettes-like line of kickers.
   Best exchange of banter: Sean Connery, Michael Caine and Roger
Moore.
   Most welcomed elimination: Singing of the nominees for best song.
   Most stunning beauty: Michelle Pfeiffer
   Worst reader of Teleprompter: Walter Matthau.

   A farm worker imprisoned for life after
his seven children were fatally poisoned in 1967 was not fairly
treated by prosecutors two decades ago, an official investigating
the case was quoted as saying.
   Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno, appointed by Gov. Bob
Martinez to review the case of James Richardson, met with Martinez
and aides to state Cabinet members Wednesday. The governor and the
six independently elected Cabinet members will hold a hearing next
week to decide whether to pardon Richardson.
   Ms. Reno refused to comment on the investigation. But the St.
Petersburg Times, in Thursday's editions, quoted several officials
who attended the meeting as saying that she has uncovered
significant flaws in the murder conviction.
   Peter Dunbar, general counsel for Martinez, told the newspaper
there was obviously a serious question in Ms. Reno's mind about
whether Richardson should be in prison.
   Dunbar said Ms. Reno found ``approximately six inches of
documents'' that should have gone to defense attorneys when
Richardson was tried. Under state law, a defendant has a right to
information collected by prosecutors, particularly information that
could exonerate him.
   Richardson, now 53, was sentenced to die in Florida's electric
chair in 1968 after an all-white jury convicted him of the
first-degree murder in the oldest child's death. Richardson is
black.
   His sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972 when the
U.S. Supreme Court outlawed the death penalty.
   The Richardson children died after eating a lunch heavily laced
with the insecticide parathion. Prosecutors charged Richardson
poisoned the food before he left for work, in order to collect
insurance. Jurors were never told that Richardson had only asked
about an insurance policy and never purchased one.
   Richardson's supporters have accused Bessie Reese, the
children's baby sitter, of killing them. The elderly woman is now
mentally incompetent and in a nursing home.
   The documents withheld from defense attorneys apparently
included a request for a search warrant indicating that Ms. Reese
had traces of parathion on her clothes.
   ``There is what I was afraid of,'' said Jim York, chief deputy
for Attorney General Bob Butterworth. ``The prosecutors didn't give
the defense everything. When it comes up this late in a
prosecution, it's serious.''
   York said that in addition to the clemency study being conducted
in the executive branch, he's asked his criminal appeals division
to look at the case.
   If the problem is as serious as it appears, York said, the
division would probably ask if the prosecution can give Richardson
a new trial. If the 20-year lapse of time makes that impossible,
Richardson could be set free, York indicated.

<HEAD>82-Year-Old Robbery Suspect Has Long Criminal History</HEAD>

   An 82-year-old man suspected as the
``salt-and-pepper bandit'' in 10 recent armed robberies has
impressed his neighbors and minister as caring, thrifty and
charitable, but has a criminal history dating to 1921.
   Jack Kelm was one of Denver's most notorious robbers in the
early 1940s, the taller partner of the ``Mutt and Jeff'' stickup
team that terrorized a half dozen supermarkets. Kelm also used to
be known in prison as ``the bifocal bandit'' because of his age,
said Wayne Patterson, a retired warden.
   Kelm was arrested Tuesday in Longmont, northeast of Boulder,
after robbing a bank and making his getaway on a stolen bicycle,
the FBI said. A U.S. Magistrate on Wednesday ordered Kelm held on
federal armed robbery charges, but in a hospital because he needed
minor surgery for a blocked urinary tract.
   Neighbors in Greeley didn't know Kelm by any of his nicknames.
   ``If he's a bank robber, he has to be some kind of Robin Hood,
because he never seemed to have money of his own,'' said Michelle
Terriere, a former neighbor.
   Kelm used to buy day-old bread to feed ducks and geese at a city
park, and would bbuy snacks for children, Terriere said.
   Kelm was ``the perfect neighbor,'' said Denise Warner, who lived
two doors from him for almost three years. ``He's not a lavish
spender and it appeared he was just making it on a pension.''
   Kelm is suspected in a string of bank, restaurant and
supermarket robberies in the last two years in Fort Collins,
Loveland, Greeley and Longmont, all north of Denver. Witnesses
described a ``salt-and-pepper'' robber, at least 60 with medium
height and build, who always stole a vehicle and showed a gun, said
Robert Pence, the FBI agent in charge in Colorado.
   Kelm was 15 when he first served time in a reformatory in St.
Charles, Ill., and was sent to a Colorado reformatory in 1924 for
burglary. In 1925, Kelm was imprisoned for stealing a car. He
escaped and was caught twice, winning release from prison in 1932.
   In 1936, Kelm escaped from a prison road gang in Florida while
serving time for breaking and entering, said Bob Macmasters,
spokesman for Florida's prison department.
   Kelm was in and out of prison in Colorado from 1940 through 1971.
   Pence said Kelm was caught Tuesday by a man whose 11-year-old
son said he saw the holdup man take off a stocking mask outside the
bank. The father followed the suspect in a car and then disarmed
him in a struggle at a nearby shopping center, Pence said.
   Kelm was armed with a harmless starter's gun, authorities said.
   Acquaintances say Kelm wore 1940s-style clothes and drove an
older model used car.
   Jerry Franz, minister of the First United Methodist Church where
Kelm is a long-time member, called him ``a wonderful, caring
person'' who helped the church in many ways. He said Kelm was a
retired house painter.
   ``He is one of those people who is always wanting to help
people,'' Franz said. ``He'd take some of our older members around
town for errands or to the doctor when they needed to go.''

<HEAD>FCC Rules Change May Spur Wireless Computers, VCRs, Speakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday made changes in its radio regulations that could provide a
multibillion-dollar boost in the development of devices such as
wireless computers, VCRs and speakers.
   The commission, voting 3-0, increased the number of frequencies
for non-licensed radio frequency devices and removed restrictions
on their usage, bandwidth and modulation.
   These devices include television remote control units, garage
door openers, wireless microphones and cordless telephones, many of
which use radio waves to send signals over short distances through
the air.
   Thomas P. Stanley, chief of the FCC's office of engineering and
technology, said the agency receives 10,000 applications a year for
such devices.
   He said the rule changes could lead to a $2 billion increase in
the production of such items.
   The FCC tightly controls the range and types of signals these
devices can emit so they don't interfere with licensed radio
operations, such as commercial broadcast stations and police and
aircraft radios.
   Thursday's ruling broadens the portion of the airwaves these
devices can use, while in some cases tightening emissions standards
to prevent interference with other radio services.
   The rules were implemented in 1938. Since then the FCC has
amended them on a case-by-case basis for each new radio frequency
device.
   ``By taking this approach, a number of inequities in the
technical standards contained in (the rules) developed,'' the FCC
said.
   ``Additionally, the standards needed to protect against
interference to licensed radio services have changed over the years
due to improvements in equipment, such as receiver sensitivity,
increased proliferation of both licensed and non-licensed radio
operations and changes to the frequency allocations of authorized
radio services.''
   The amended rules will ``restore the technical flexibility
originally envisioned for non-licensed devices'' and ``eliminate
all unnecessary and overly restrictive technical regulations,'' the
agency said.
   The commission also voted not to allow new radio frequency
devices to operate on broadcast frequencies being reserved for the
next generation of television _ high-definition television _ which
may require a larger piece of the broadcast spectrum than now
needed for TV signals.

<TEXT>
   Police wearing bullet-proof jackets
sipped coffee and cognac in local cafes Thursday, describing their
battles to anyone who would listen.
   After days of unrest and bloodshed in Kosovo province, the
officers were relaxing with their automatic weapons, sniper rifles
and tear gas canisters at their sides.
   One officer, brought in from outside Kosovo to help quell the
riots, recalled how a small police truck was set afire by ethnic
Albanian demonstrators in the village of Suva Reka, 30 miles south
of Pristina.
   Two policemen managed to jump out of the truck, which was
carrying live ammunition, he said.
   The truck eventually exploded, ``killing a few'' demonstrators
and injuring several others ``who had gathered around it
celebrating the victory,'' he said.
   All the officers spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
   Witnesses, who also demanded anonymity, said in Zur, a village
near the Albanian border, an unspecified number of demonstrators
were killed or injured Tuesday when a hand grenade they tried to
toss at the local police post exploded.
   In the provincial capital of Pristina, a bulldozer ran wild
Tuesday after police shot to death the driver when he tried to
charge a police squadron, said an officer. The bulldozer continued
weaving through the street, smashing parked cars before it hit a
house and stopped, said the officer.
   Protesters used firearms, knives, rocks and bricks in assaults
on helmeted riot police, apparently catching them off guard.
   A photographer taking shots of riots in Pristina overheard a
frantic radio appeal from a police officer to his commander: ``They
are shooting at us. What shall we do?''
   ``If you can't stop them, shoot at their legs,'' the commander
replied.
   Officially, 21 demonstrators and two police officers were killed
in the clashes between ethnic Albanians and riot police. At least
92 were injured in the unrest, sparked by constitutional changes
the ethnic Albanians fear will curb the province's autonomy.
   Ethnic Albanian witnesses said they thought many more people
died. Yugoslav journalists from other ethnic groups said they also
thought the death toll could be higher.
   Witnesses in Pristina described the street battles as ``akin to
television footage of fighting in Beirut.''

<TEXT>
   Vietnam's ruling Communist Party has
blamed itself for ``many shortcomings'' in carrying out economic
reforms endorsed two years ago, Hanoi radio reported Thursday.
   The criticism came at a Central Committee meeting that ended
Wednesday, the radio said.
   It broadcast a committee statement noting improvements since the
reforms began _ particularly in agriculture, the mainstay of the
economy _ but added that ``improvements achieved so far have not
been uniform and fundamental while the socio-economic situation
remains fraught with acute difficulties.''
   ``The party's leadership task and the state's management work
have displayed many shortcomings,'' it said.
   Party leaders have been slow to implement party congress
resolutions and renovate the party and state organizations, the
statement said, adding that the 10-day meeting's purpose was ``to
review two years' implementation of the sixth party congress
resolutions and establish orientations and tasks for the next three
years.''
   The Sixth National Party Congress of late 1986 endorsed
decentralization, Western-style economic reforms and more relaxed
policies in other areas of society.
   Vietnamese officials have said the reforms boosted production in
some areas but barriers remain, including a traditionalist
bureaucracy.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's spokesman said Thursday that
the administration's support for closing tax loopholes does not
violate the president's ``no new taxes'' pledge.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We're always vigilant
to close tax loopholes, and if we can find any loopholes that allow
us to get more revenue, we're always willing to take action if we
can.''
   Fitzwater was asked to respond to remarks by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, who suggested that budget negotiations with
Congress might produce mesures to close loopholes in the tax system.
   Brady said that such measures should not be interpreted as tax
increases. He said the ones he had in mind were small.
   Fitzwater said Brady was ``not sending any particular signals.
... We are not signaling new revenue increases.''
   Asked how the administration defined the difference between a
tax increase and a loophole-closer, Fitzwater said, ``Well, it's
like pornography; we'll know it when we see it.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration Rules Out Federal Takeover of Cleanup Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday that the oil
spill off Alaska's coast is ``a major tragedy,'' but his
administration ruled out a federal takeover of the cleanup. The
Coast Guard chief said the oil tanker's path was so wide that a
child could have navigated it safely.
   Meanwhile, top administration officials reported that the
cleanup was marred by the shipping company's failure to respond
swiftly in the hours just after the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground
last Friday.
   ``Approximately 10 million gallons (of crude oil) went into the
water and most of that went into the water in the first five
hours,'' said Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner.
   He said faster action by the Exxon Shipping Co., which owned the
supertanker, ``might have diminished it (the damage) somewhat.''
   While U.S. officials were generally generous in their praise of
Exxon's subsequent performance in the cleanup effort, Adm. Paul
Yost, the Coast Guard commandant, voiced incredulity that the
accident could have happened at all.
   Yost said that the large-ship channel leading from Valdez,
Alaska, where the tanker had taken on its cargo of crude oil, to
the open Gulf of Alaska, was wide and well-marked.
   ``We've got 10 miles of open water there. And for that vessel to
come over and hit a reef is almost unbelievable,'' Yost told
reporters.
   ``This is not treacherous in the area they went aground. It's 10
miles wide. Your children could drive a tanker up through it.''
   ``Obviously something went very badly wrong,'' he said.
   He said allegations of ``alcohol use'' by the tanker's captain,
Joseph Hazelwood, were being closely scrutinized by the government.
   At the time the tanker ran aground, Hazelwood was in his cabin
and a relatively junior officer, third mate Gregory Cousins, was at
the helm.
   Yost, Skinner and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator
William Reilly spoke to reporters at the White House after briefing
Bush on their two-day survey of efforts to battle the spreading oil
slick in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   Bush, speaking to the Association of Community and Junior
Colleges, said the spill _ the worst in the nation's history _ was
``a subject of concern to all Americans today.''
   Departing from his prepared text, Bush said: ``There's no doubt
this is a major tragedy, both for the environment and for the
people up there.''
   He expressed confidence that those involved in the cleanup were
doing their best ``to see that the damage is restricted.''
   But, the president said, ``let's be frank. There are some very
serious problems up there right now.''
   He said the cleanup ``will not be easy.''
   At the same time, the administration decided against one option
initially mentioned by Bush as a possibility _ a federal takeover
of the cleanup process.
   Skinner said the cleanup operation now appears to be
well-coordinated among Exxon, federal and state agencies, and ``at
this point there is not a need to federalize this effort.''
   ``Such a decision might be counterproductive because of the
coordination that is now going on,'' he added.
   Reilly said damage to fish and wildlife ``may be felt there for
some time to come.''
   ``This is obviously a disaster of enormous potential magnitude
and impact on the environment,'' Reilly said. ``It seems inevitable
that there will be a very substanial impacts.''
   Reilly said Bush had given ``top priority'' to a federal
assessment of how to best protect the oil-damaged areas of the
once-pristine area in southern Alaska.
   Reilly said the spill would not change the administration's
support for oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
in northeast Alaska.
   ``All things considered, it is inconceivable that any nation
would walk away from the resources that may exist in the magnitude
that is potentially there in Alaska,'' Reilly said.
   ``Until last Friday night, the record was pretty good for
transporting oil through Prince William Sound,'' the EPA chief said.
   The three officials will continue to monitor the situation and
report to the president in 30 days with recommendations, including
possible options for long-range steps, said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Skinner said that ``at the appropriate time'' the government
would decide ``what penalties are appropriate,'' noting that a
state criminal investigation was also taking place.
   He said he and the other Bush officials who toured the disaster
site had stressed in a meeting with Exxon Shipping Co. President
Frank Iarossi and other Exxon officials ``our concern that the
people most affected by this'' be adequately compensated.
   Skinner said the Exxon officials vowed ``to put their money
where their mouth is'' and that the United States would hold the
company to its commitment.
   The transportation secretary said the supertanker ripped into
the reef at about 15 knots, or about 17 miles per hour.

<TEXT>
   A political leader in Namibia predicted
Thursday that independence from South Africa will not bring the
dramatic changes many people expect.
   The official transition begins Saturday, along with a cease-fire
in the 23-year-old guerrilla war begins. an informal truce has been
observed for months, but South Africa and the rebel South-West
Africa People's Organization formally made the formal agreement
Thursday.
   Martti Ahtisaari, the U.N. representative who will oversee the
transition to independence, is to arrive Friday.
   Many black Namibians believe the United Nations will take over
the territory Saturday, discrimination will end and South African
officials will leave.
   Louis Pienaar, appointed by South Africa to impartially govern
the territory and run elections, said the only immediate change
will be ``the presence of Mr. Ahtisaari.''
   Dirk Mudge, president of a multiracial coalition expected to be
SWAPO's main competition in the November elections, said,
``Irresponsible people are going around telling Namibians that on
the first of April things will change in this country.''
   ``There's going to be a lot of disappointment,'' said Mudge,
leader of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance.
   Danny Tjongarero, acting chairman of SWAPO, which has waged
political and guerrila campaigns for independence since 1966, said
Ahtisaari's arrival ``is indeed a historic event and one all
Namibians have been looking forward to.''
   ``Our people in the townships see the arrival of the United
Nations as assuming responsibility over Namibia,'' Tjongarero said.
   Pienaar said he will not rescind laws providing for racially
segregated schools, hospitals and municipal governments, but after
consultation with Ahtisaari will begin repealing discriminatory
laws that may hinder a free and fair election.
   He said his first proclamation, effective next week, will remove
all obstacles to political meetings, previously restricted by
security legislation. South Africa has administered Namibia since
World War I and the United Nations has been trying to get it out of
the territory since 1966. The South Africans agreed to the
independence plan as part of a regional accord that also calls for
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.
   R.F. Botha, the South African foreign minister, said Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain is expected in Namibia this
weekend as the transition to independence begins.
   He said Mrs. Thatcher probably would visit British members of
the U.N. peacekeeping force that will monitor elections scheduled
for November.
   The U.N. group will consist of 4,650 U.N. peacekeepers, 500
police monitors, 620 election monitors from various nations, at
least 760 U.N. civilian administrators and 820 locally hired staff.
   The South African government said Thursday no territory or
colony in Africa had been as well prepared for independence as
Namibia, and gave itself the credit.
   It said South Africa had provided more resources to Namibia
``than any colonial power devoted to the development of territories
under its control.''

   Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the first black to
serve as White House national security adviser, was promoted to
full general Thursday during a Pentagon ceremony hosted by the
Army's chief of staff.
   Powell, who is scheduled to assume command of the Forces Command
at Fort McPherson, Ga., on April 4, was surrounded by family,
friends and the Army's top brass as Gen. Carl E. Vuono Jr., the
chief of staff, presided at the ceremony.
   In his new post, Powell will command all Army troops inside the
continental United States, including reserves, and play a key role
in determining the manner in which they are trained and equipped.
   Thursday, he became only the fourth black officer to ever attain
four-star rank in the U.S. armed forces. Two of those four are
currently on active duty _ Powell and Air Force Gen. Bernard P.
Randolph.
   The first black four-star general in American history was also
an Air Force officer, Gen. Daniel ``Chappie'' James, who won his
rank in August 1975. He died shortly after retiring in 1978. The
second was Army Gen. Roscoe Robinson, who won his fourth star on
Aug. 30, 1982, and retired in November 1985.
   The move from national security adviser to chief of the Forces
Command was announced in December by then-President Reagan. Powell
succeeded Frank C. Carlucci as Reagan's national security adviser
after Carlucci was tapped to replace the retiring Caspar W.
Weinberger as defense secretary in late 1987.

   The Chicago Tribune and The Philadelphia
Inquirer each won two 1989 Pulitzer Prizes in journalism Thursday,
and the Anchorage Daily News won the public-service gold medal for
a series on alcoholism and suicide among native Alaskans.
   The Inquirer's Donald L. Bartlett and James B. Steele won for a
series on provisions in the 1986 Tax Reform Act that would have
given special tax breaks to politically well-connected individuals
and businesses. The two reporters also won a Pulitzer in 1975 for
national reporting on the Internal Revenue Service.
   The newspaper's David Zucchino won the Pulitzer in feature
writing for his series ``Being Black in South Africa.''
   Clarence Page of the Tribune won the Pulitzer in commentary for
columns on local and national affairs, and the newspaper's Lois
Wille won in editorial writing.
   The Pulitzer for general news reporting was won by the staff of
The Louisville Courier-Journal. The newspaper was cited for its
initial coverage of a bus crash that killed 27 students and for its
examination of the accident's causes and implications.
   Bill Dedman of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution won the
investigative reporting prize for a series on racial discrimination
practiced by the city's lending institutions.
   The series, which led to banking reforms, also won a 1988
Southern Journalism Award for investigative reporting.
   A team from The Dallas Morning News won the explanatory
journalism Pulitzer for their coverage of a 1986 airplane crash.
The journalists _ reporter David Hanners, photographer William
Snyder and artist Karen Blessen _ also were cited for their
coverage of the crash's investigation and its implications for air
safety.
   The 12-page special section ``Anatomy of An Air Crash: The Final
Flight of 50 Sierra Kilo'' examined from start to finish the
investigation by the NTSB of the crash of a jet carrying executives
of a New Jersey company. The plane went down in in bad weather near
Redwater, Texas, killing seven. The NTSB report, filed 22 months
later, cited controller error and malfunctioning radar equipment.
   ``Even though, our three names are on it, it was a team
effort,'' Hanners told colleagues in the newsroom. ``It was a
relatively simple story, eloquently told with words, pictures and
graphics.''
   The Pulitzer for specialized reporting went to Edward Humes of
The Orange County (Calif.) Register for reporting on the military
establishment in Southern California.
   The Pulitzer board awarded two prizes for international
reporting. One went to Glenn Frankel of The Washington Post for
reporting from the Middle East, and the other was won by Bill
Keller of The New York Times for coverage of the Soviet Union.
   The Pulitzer for criticism was won by Michael Skube, book editor
of The News and Observer of Raleigh, N.C. The editorial cartooning
prize went to Jack Higgins of the Chicago Sun-Times.
   Pat Dougherty, Anchorage Daily News city editor, said the
paper's public-service prize ``will give us a chance to reiterate
the point of the stories done in the first place: we've got a
serious problem up here.'' The paper won a public-service Pulitzer
in 1976 for a series on the Teamsters union in Alaska.
   The paper's 10-day, 44-story series found that alcoholism is
rampant in rural Alaska and the suicide rate for Eskimos and
Indians is four times the national rate. The series also detailed
high rates of domestic violence and child abuse among native
Alaskans. The series attributed these problems to a lack of job
opportunities and a clash of cultures between native Alaskans and
whites.
   The spot news photography prize was awarded to Ron Olshwanger, a
free-lance photographer, for a picture published in the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch of a fire fighter giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
to a child who had been pulled from a burning building. Manny
Crisotomo of the Detroit Free Press won in feature photography for
a series on student life at Southwestern High School.
   ``My hair's a mess, it's got champagne all over it. This is
wonderful,'' said Crisostomo.
   Each of the Pulitzers carries a $3,000 prize, except for public
service, which is recognized with a gold medal.
   Zucchino's winning entry for feature writing was originally
entered in the international reporting category and recommended as
one of several possible winners to the Pulitzer Board. The board
transferred the series to the feature-writing category and gave it
the prize for feature writing.
   The Courier-Journal's coverage of the bus crash was not one of
the finalists recommended by the Pulitzer jury to the Pulitzer
Board. Robert Christopher, board secretary, said the board asked
for the names of additional nominees and chose the Courier-Journal
story from that group.
   In awarding the general news reporting prize to the
Courier-Journal, the Pulitzer Board passed over three entries
nominated by the jury that read all the entries in the category.
The entries passed over were submitted by the Gwinnett Daily News
of Lawrenceville, Ga.; The Billings (Mont.) Gazette, and The Miami
Herald.
   Humes said of his prize for specialized reporting: ``It's great.
We're all standing here, there's little bits of paper all over the
place and I'm dripping wet. It's pretty unexpected. I had no idea.
Maybe someone here might have, but they didn't tell me.''
   Bill Drozdiak, foreign editor of The Washington Post, said of
the prize for Frankel's Middle East reporting: ``We're absolutely
delighted. We feel that it's a wonderful tribute to the fine work
that Glenn has done for us in his entire three-year assignment in
Israel, and even going back to his earlier assignment in South
Africa. He's one of our finest foreign correspondents and has done
superb work under very difficult circumstances.''

<TEXT>
   The leadership of Gannett Co. and USA Today
realigns this week with the retirement Friday of Allen H. Neuharth
as chairman of the company and the succession of John J. Curley to
the top post.
   Gannett executives also announced Thursday that John C. Quinn is
relinquishing the title of editor in chief of USA Today. Quinn will
continue as Gannett executive vice president for news until his
retirement in October, 1990, Curley said.
   Neuharth, 65, announced March 22 that he is also resigning from
the company's board of directors, effective at the annual
shareholders' meeting in Chicago April 27. He will continue to
write his weekly column for USA Today.
   Curley, 50, will be Gannett's fourth chairman and chief
executive officer. He has been president of Gannett since 1984 and
chief executive officer since 1986. He joined Gannett in 1969 as an
editor at the Times-Union in Rochester, N.Y. He held editor and
publisher posts at Gannett newspapers in New Jersey and Delaware
and served as general manager of the Gannett News Service.
   Neuharth has been a Gannett executive for 26 years. He was named
president and chief operating officer in 1970, president and chief
executive officer in 1973, and president, chief executive officer
and chairman in 1979. He is the founder of USA Today.
   Quinn, 63, had been editor of the national newspaper for five
years before becoming editor in chief in 1988.
   The announcement said Quinn's responsibilities will be assumed
by Peter S. Prichard, editor since 1988, and Ronald D. Martin,
executive editor since the newspaper began publication in 1982.
They will continue to have their present titles.
   Gannett publishes 85 daily newspapers, 35 non-daily newspapers
and USA Weekend, a newspaper magazine. It operates 10 television
stations, 16 radio stations, Gannett News Services and an outdoor
advertising company.

   A Tel Aviv district court convicted a
Soviet-born Israeli of passing army secrets to the Palestine
Liberation Organization, Israel radio said Thursday.
   It said Benjamin Shenkman, 36, was convicted on Sunday after he
confessed to charges of transferring secret information to the
enemy and having contacts with enemy agents. He told the court he
asked for $1.5 million in return for the information, the radio
reported.
   Shenkman, who reportedly became disillusioned with Israeli
society after immigrating here from the Soviet Union in 1978, never
received any of the money he requested.
   Sentencing was set for April 12. The maximum term is 33 years.
   Shenkman told the court he visited Athens, Greece, three times
in 1988 and gave PLO officials information about his military
service, including the location of bases and names of commanders.
   He also offered to fly to PLO headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia,
and hold a news conference where he would rip up his passport and
say Israel is a racist state, the court heard.
   Shenkman served in the army for four months in 1985. It would be
unusual for a new immigrant who served for a short time to hold a
sensitive position.
   Shenkman was arrested at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport upon his
return from his third visit to Athens.
   His was the second recent case of espionage involving a Soviet
emigre. On Dec. 15, Shabtai Kalmanovich, 45, was jailed for nine
years for spying for the Soviet Union and having contacts with a
foreign agent.

<HEAD>Armed Services Chairman Pushes for Missile Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House chairman said Thursday that reaching
concensus in Congress on modernizing the nation's land-based
missile force requires both building Midgetman missiles and basing
MXs aboard railroad cars.
   ``If we want to settle the ICBM issue once and for all, we need
a program that will take the 50 MX missiles out o silos and put
them on rails and that will build 300 to 500 Midgetman missiles,''
Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said in remarks in Los
Angeles.
   Lawmakers have wrangled for years over whether to choose the
smaller, single-warhead Midgetman missile supported by many
Democrats or instead back the mobile, 10-warhead MX missile that is
a favorite of Republicans.
   A newly unveiled Democratic compromise offer calls for
converting the 50 existing MX missiles from vulnerable silos to a
rail garrison basing mode _ placing them on railroad cars and
moving them around the country _ and building 300 to 500 Midgetman
missiles.
   Aspin said Democrats will not accept more than 50 MX missiles.
   ``For political consensus we are probably going to have to have
both rail MX and Midgetman,'' Aspin said. Copies of his speech were
released by his office in Washington.
   But Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala., the top Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, on Wednesday called the plan a ``bad deal''
because it would place unacceptable limits on defense programs,
including capping MX production at the 50 already fielded.
   He also was criticial of the plan's envisioned development of
the Midgetman at a cost of $25 million to $35 million, negative
growth in defense spending and cuts in funding for Star Wars and
the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Dickinson urged his fellow GOP lawmakers to vote against the
Midgetman unless Democrats agree to President Bush's call for an
increase in defense spending after fiscal 1990.
   Bush has proposed zero growth in defense spending in fiscal
1990, 1 percent growth in fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992 and 2 percent
growth in fiscal 1993.
   ``The small ICBM is a good system, and our national security
would benefit from having it,'' Dickinson said in a two-page
statement. ``But if the cost of the program is gutting SDI and
other programs while defense budgets continue to be reduced, then
we are better off with no deal.''
   In his speech, Aspin suggested sequential spending to finance
the plan with construction of the rail MX first and the Midgetman
second or vice versa. He also proposed ``flattening the SDI budget
... or slipping the B-2 or knocking out some operational weapons in
order to free up money for modernization.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney supported the MX while he served
in the House, but he has not indicated if he would back a plan
based on the MX, the Midgetman or a mix of the two. National
security adviser Brent Scowcroft is an opponent of the MX.
   Last week, Gen. Larry Welch, Air Force chief of staff, discussed
the plan with legislators but was publicly rebuked by Cheney for
``freelancing.'' Aspin called Cheney's criticism a ``bum rap.''
   ``Welch wasn't trying to put a deal together. He made plain he
wasn't speaking for the president. He was just exploring the
outlines of a possible compromise with Congress with no intention
of cutting the new secretary out of the deal,'' Aspin said.

   Prices farmers got for raw products rose 0.7
percent from February to March, averaging 15 percent more than a
year ago, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that higher prices for eggs, broilers, wheat and
potatoes were mostly responsible for the increase from the February
average.
   Lower prices for tomatoes, oranges, milk and strawberries partly
offset the rise for the other commodities.
   ``Market egg prices were at their highest level since April
1984, while the average broiler price increased moderately from
February,'' the report said. ``Feed grain and soybean prices also
increased from a month earlier, and the all-wheat price was at the
highest level since February of 1981.''
   The preliminary wheat price for March was $4.16 per bushel, up
from $4.03 in February. That was the highest wheat price in any
month since it was $4.17 more than eight years ago.
   Egg prices at the farm, fewer because of massive cutbacks last
year in the nation's laying hen flock, averaged more than 80 cents
a dozen, up 20 cents from February and almost 30 cents from a year
ago.
   Most fruit and vegetable prices were down from February, and
cattle and hogs also were down slightly.
   Last year's drought helped reduce supplies of major crops,
including corn, soybeans and wheat, which has resulted in higher
prices. But cutbacks or delayed expansion by many livestock
producers also have helped bolster market prices.
   The overall index of prices paid to farmers in March averaged
149 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison.
   John Buche of the department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service said the index has been averaging at record monthly levels
since it climbed to 149 percent in January from 145 in December. It
dipped to 148 in February before gaining again in March, according
to the preliminary figures.
   Buche said the previous high for the ``current series'' of price
statistics going back to 1965 was 146 percent in January 1984.
   According to the preliminary March price figures, based mostly
on midmonth averages, the index for livestock and livestock
products as a group rose 1.3 percent from the February average and
was up 8.1 percent from a year ago.
   The department's all-crops price index for March was down 0.7
percent from February but averaged 23 percent above a year ago.
   No new price figures for farm production costs were included in
the February report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages
because of budget cutbacks.
   In January, however, new quarterly figures showed that prices
paid by farmers to meet expenses were up 1.2 percent from last fall
and were 6.1 percent higher than a year earlier.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $48
billion to $52 billion this year, compared with a near-record of
$57 billion in 1988. That is the difference between cash receipts
and cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise
moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier
production items.
   Food prices in 1988 rose an average of 4.1 percent, and USDA
analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is likely
in 1989.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $71.20 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, down from $71.50 in February but up from $68.30 in
March 1988. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $39.80 per 100 pounds, compared with $40.40 in
February and $42.20 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.61 a bushel, was up from $2.58 in February and from
$1.86 in March 1988.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $4.16 per bushel, compared with $4.03 in February and
$2.74 a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $6.46 per 100 pounds, down from $6.59 in
February. Rice was $9.22 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $7.57 per bushel, up from $7.41 in February and
$6.05 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 55.5 cents per pound, up from
52.9 in February but down from 57.9 in March 1988.
   _Eggs were 80.1 cents per dozen, compared with 62.1 cents in
February and 50.8 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12.80 per 100 pounds, compared with $13.10 in
February and $11.90 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 38.7 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
35.2 cents in February and 27.5 cents a year ago.

<HEAD>Bush Against Private School Tax Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House on Thursday corrected the
impression left by President Bush that he opposes giving tax breaks
to parents who send their children to private schools.
   Bush still supports the notion of tuition tax credits in
concept, but believes the government cannot afford them now in an
era of big budget deficits, said White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   ``That's what he meant to say,'' Fitzwater said with a smile.
``That's what a careful reading will show.''
   Bush had said Wednesday that all taxpayers have an obligation to
support the public education system.
   ``And then, if on top of that, your parents think that they want
to shell out, in addition to the tax money, tuition money, that's
their right and that should be respected. But I don't think they
should get a break for that.''
   The issue arose when Bush fielded questions from a group of
young people.The president said he had been ``intrigued with the
concept of tuition tax credits. And some say, well should that
include parachoial schools. And I've said, yes.''
   However, Bush said, ``We can't afford to do that.''
   Backpedaling from Bush's comments, Fitzwater said, ``He hasn't
changed his position at all in terms of how he views the tuition
tax credit but he does not believe we can afford it at this time.
He still supports it in concept.''
   Bush will send a package of education proposals to Congress on
Wednesday but it will not contain tuition tax credits, Fitzwater
said.
   In a speech Thursday to the American Association of Community
and Junior Colleges, the president put in a plug for his
alternative teacher certification proposal.
   ``I believe secondary and elementary schools can learn a lot
from your success, starting with your policy of flexibility,'' he
said. ``By this, I mean the way in which you tap local talent and
draw on the knowledge of experts from the private sector.''
   ``When a Ph.D on sabbatical cannot volunteer as a teacher in
many school districts, something is very wrong,'' Bush said. He
said that's the reason he wants ``to open classrooms to every
qualified person with the talent, the knowledge and the desire to
teach.''
   Bush said ``we must all pitch in to restore our educational
system'' and to help America's workers compete with those in other
countries.

<HEAD>Nuclear Reactor Stays Shut After Operators Fail Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Problem-plagued Turkey Point's only working nuclear
reactor remained shut down Thursday until Florida Power &amp; Light Co.
can prove to federal inspectors its staff knows how to operate the
plant safely.
   The utility took the unit off line Wednesday when the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission announced that half of the key control room
operators tested had failed their routine yearly requalification
exam. That immediately barred them from running the plant.
   Eleven of 24 operators and three of six teams _ who are tested
on their ability to work together _ failed all or part of the exam,
said NRC spokesman Ken Clark.
   The results were so worrisome, the NRC is sending a special team
to review the performance of all control room staff at the plant,
located on the Atlantic coast about 20 miles south of Miami.
   ``We want to take a look at the rest of the operators too, even
the ones who have passed the NRC exam,'' Clark said Thursday. ``We
have questions now about the adequacy of their training program.''
   Those who failed must be retrained and recertified by the NRC
before they are allowed back into the control room. The Florida
utility says it hopes to complete all the testing within a week.
   ``If we are satisfed, the plant will probably be allowed to go
back on line,'' Clark said.
   The utility must also file a full report with the NRC by May 1
detailing how the company will upgrade training to satisfactory
levels.
   Utility spokeswoman Stacey Shaw minimized the training
difficulties on Thursday, calling the failure rate ``an unusual
circumstance.''
   More than half of those who failed the exam were inactive
management personnel who no longer work in the control room, but
maintain their licenses, she said. In all, the utility has 52
licensed operators, of which 40 actually work in the control rooms.
   She insisted the utility voluntarily shut down Unit 3 on
Wednesday, although Clark said the NRC would not have accepted
anything less.
   Anti-nuclear activist Joette Lorion, who has conducted a
one-woman crusade against Turkey Point for years, said the test
failures are extremely serious.
   ``Operators of nuclear plants are very important,'' she said.
``We've seen in accidents such as Three Mile Island and Chernobyl
that operator error greatly contributed to, and in some cases even
caused, the accidents.''
   The NRC has hit Turkey Point with about $1 million in fines over
the past five years for safety and security violations, identifying
the plant as one of the nation's ten worst. Ralph Nader's Public
Citizen environmental group has also called it one of the
worst-managed commercial facilities.
   Last year, the Florida utility was forced by the NRC to overhaul
Turkey Point's management after a series of incidents, including a
leak that severely corroded a giant bolt holding the reactor vessel
together, guards found asleep on duty, unescorted visitors in
sensitive areas, leaks from the spent fuel pool and other problems.
   There are two nuclear units at Turkey Point. The other unit is
undergoing refueling, and is not expected back on line until
mid-April, said utility spokesman Gary Mehalik. The two
666-megawatt units, built in the early 1970s, are capable of
providing about 10 percent of the capacity of Florida Power &amp;
Light, which serves more than 3 million customers in South and
Central Florida.

   Former Army Col. David Hackworth, a hero whose
disenchantment with the Vietnam War led to a self-imposed exile,
wants to return to the United States, a magazine reported.
   Hackworth, who went to Australia after the war and made millions
in a restaurant business and a duck farm, hopes to move to Colorado
and become a military commentator, Parade says in its Sunday issue.
   The article was written by former Secretary of the Navy James
Webb, who praised Hackworth but also said he could learn much by
coming back to the United States and seeing ``how we have been
slowly and honestly coming to grips'' with the Vietnam War. Webb
was Navy secretary in the Reagan administration.
   ``My first love has always been the Army,'' Webb quoted
Hackworth, 58, as saying. ``I think I have some important insights
to offer, especially in the area of readiness and training.''
   Hackworth was awarded two Distinguished Service Crosses, nine
Silver Stars, four Legions of Merit and eight Bronze Stars and was
an almost certain candidate for general when his downfall began.
   During his four years in Vietnam, he became increasingly
frustrated by what he saw as the Army's lack of overall objectives
and its failure to adapt its tactics to the enemy.
   By 1971, Hackworth said, he was convinced the war was lost and
decided to ``hurt the Army as badly as she'd hurt me. I went out of
my way to break every regulation I could.''
   He castigated the Army's strategy and leadership on the
television program ``Issues and Answers,'' and predicted in a
Newsweek interview that the North Vietnamese flag would be flying
over Saigon in 1975. He was nearly court-martialed before he
retired from the military.

<HEAD>New Rules Designed to Discourage Frivolous Challenges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday adopted new rules designed to limit the payments radio and
TV station owners may make to ``quick-buck artists'' who challenge
station licenses.
   At the same time, the FCC asked for further comment on the
standards used in the so-called comparative renewal process by
which the commission decides if station owners are worthy
license-holders.
   The FCC has been concerned about frivolous challenges to station
licenses and sham applications made by entities that hope to get
license-holders to pay them off rather than fight the competing
applications.
   Challenges may be made during the comparative renewal process or
by a direct petition to deny a license renewal on grounds the
station is not serving the public interest.
   The rules adopted Thursday would ban all settlement payments
prior to an initial decision by the FCC in a comparative hearing
and would limit payments after that hearing to ``the legitimate and
prudent expenses of the withdrawing applicant.'' In petitions to
deny, the payments would be limited to the same legitimate and
prudent expenses standard.
   The new rules also require prior FCC approval of all payment
agreements, and they eliminate the so-called Cameron doctrine that
allowed competing applicants to presume that they could acquire the
incumbent licensee's transmitter site and avoid completion of an
engineering application.
   The commission also voted to revise the form filed by
challengers to require additional financial, ownership and other
information.

<HEAD>Nine South Africans Deported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GABORONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine South Africans were deported
Thursday after being arrested in a town where two alleged South
African commandos are serving prison terms, authorities said.
   Police and army officials said the nine claimed to be salesmen
marketing cleansers. One of the group had a rocket flare and
another had a pair of handcuffs, the officials said.
   A police official said on condition of anonymity that
authorities had insufficient evidence to file any charges.
   The official said the men, some of them white and some black,
had very little money with them and seemed to lack expertise about
their products.
   They were arrested Tuesday in Francistown, where South Africans
Theodore Hermansen and Johannes Basson began serving 10-year prison
terms last year after their capture during an aborted South African
cross-border raid.
   A South African army unit had been sent into Botswana on a
mission against the African National Congress guerrilla movement.
The soldiers encountered a Botswana police patrol and fled back
into South Africa after firing on the unarmed policemen, injuring
three of them.
   Hermansen and Basson, dressed in plainclothes, were arrested at
a roadblock near the scene of the shooting. In December, they were
convicted of assault.
   During their trial, their Botswanan defense laywer and a black
South African were arrested and charged with plotting to free the
two white commandos from prison. That case has not been completed.

<HEAD>12 States Will Expand Guard Role in Drug Fight</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Cheney Interview, Bjt</HEAD>

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday he
had approved plans submitted by 12 states to step up the use of
their National Guard units in fighting drug trafficking.
   Cheney's approval means the 12 states will be eligible for extra
federal funds from a special congressional appropriation approved
last year to finance such National Guard operations.
   ``I signed off this morning on the packages for 12 states,
letters to the governors, announcing to them that their plans for
using some of that $40 million that Congress appropriated for the
Guard have been approved,'' Cheney said in interview.
   Late Thursday, the Pentagon released a list of the project
approvals, showing the 12 states would divide $11.8 million _ or
29.4 percent _ of the $40 million that Congress set aside.
   ``Based on recommendations from law enforcement agencies, plans
from 12 border states were accorded the highest priority ...,'' the
Pentagon said in a statement.
   ``Plans from the other states have been reviewed and approved by
the Defense Department and have been sent to the Department of
Justice for further review.''
   The 12 states whose plans were approved Thursday include
Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana,
Mississippi, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas and Washington.
   The Pentagon said that, in general, the states are planning to
increase National Guard operations by emphasizing more ``aerial
photography and other imagery; radar surveillance; long-range
reconnaissance; assistance in searching containers, and the
transportation of law enforcement personnel, equipment and seized
substances.''
   In addition, the Pentagon said some of the state governments
planned to ``expand training of law enforcement personnel and
increase the loans of military equipment.''
   ``This expanded role does not include direct participation by
Guard personnel in police activities such as arrest and seizure,''
the Pentagon stressed.
   The goal is ``supporting civilian drug law enforcement agencies
in the nationwide crusade against drugs.''
   Earlier Thursday, Cheney made it clear he opposed the idea of
turning soldiers into policemen with the power to make arrests.
   ``I think it's important for everybody to remember that the
mission of the Defense Department is to defend the country,'' he
said. ``It's not a law enforcement function.''
   The Pentagon said the state of Florida was receiving the largest
grant of those announced Thursday at $3.4 million. The other states
and the amounts they will receive are:

<HEAD>Analysts Say Living Together Replaces Marriage for Some Young People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decline in marriage doesn't mean young people
are avoiding having a continuing relationship, population analysts
said Thursday, adding that living together is replacing matrimony
for some pairs _ at least for a while.
   ``Both in behavior and attitude, the timing of the marriage
ceremony is becoming a matter of personal taste and convenience and
less a major life-course transition,'' said Larry Bumpass of the
University of Wisconsin.
   Bumpass told a session of the Population Association of America
that between half and two-thirds of the decline in marriage among
young people can be accounted for by a rise in cohabitation.
   For example, he said, among people under age 20, the share
married declined from 27 percent in 1970 to 14 percent in 1985, but
the figure for people involved in a union, including marriage and
cohabitation, slipped only from 29 percent to 23 percent.
   For people aged 25 or over, Bumpass said, the marriage drop was
from 72 percent to 55 percent over the same years, but including
those living together meant people in a union declined from 75
percent to 69 percent.
   Federal statistics on cohabiting adults are weak, statisticians
have said, because they also include people rooming together and
other situations in which the people are not having an intimate
relationship. Bumpass based his report on the National Survey of
Families and Households, an in-depth analysis of 13,017 households.
   He disputed a popular notion that people cohabiting are
well-educated, affluent young persons.
   Rather, Bumpass and other analysts reported, people living
together were more likely to have lower incomes and less education
than others.
   Linda A. Jacobsen of Cornell University suggested that financial
problems may lead to a decision to cohabit in many cases, with
young people unable to afford to set up housekeeping on their own.
   They often face a need to trade privacy for companionship and
household economies, she said.
   A decline in marriage among younger people doesn't mean they
have abandoned the institution, said Odalia Ho Wong of the
University of Maryland-Baltimore.
   Women are postponing marriage and families to complete their
education and launch a career, she said, but eventually most do wed
and are then in a financial condition to consider children soon
after marriage, rather than waiting.
   Christine A. Bachrach of the Center for Population Research
agreed that economics likely plays an important part in
cohabitation, but she said that population experts may be giving
too little attention to another important factor _ sex.
   Marriage ages were unusually low in the decades following World
War II, while early in this century weddings were delayed, as they
are now, with financial considerations a factor, she said.
   But cohabitation was not as common years ago as it has become,
she added, and this increase must be considered to be a part of a
sexual revolution, something more tolerated now.
   In addition to economics, the population experts said other
factors that are important include a desire to screen a potential
marriage partner.

   Oliver North's lawyers argued Thursday that
former President Reagan ``is without question a material witness''
and should be ordered to testify in North's Iran-Contra trial.
   ``In this country a president is up from the masses and when his
time is over he goes back to the masses,'' said North attorney
Barry Simon. ``We are talking about a person who is retired from
public office.''
   North, a former National Security Council aide being tried on 12
charges in connection with the Iran-Contra affair, had wanted
Reagan as the leadoff witness when the defense case opens Monday.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he will rule Friday,
which is a day off for the jury.
   Reagan, who has called North ``a national hero,'' would be the
first ex-president to testify in response to a subpoena.
   The Justice Department and Reagan's personal attorney argued
that Gesell should quash the Reagan subpoena because North's
lawyers had failed to show that the former president has any
information that bears on the case.
   But Simon insisted that Reagan ``is without question a material
witness'' in the case.
   ``We have a right to subpoena, put his testimony on live before
the jury and let them assess'' Reagan's credibility, Simon said. He
said that a taped question-and-answer session with Reagan, one of
the suggestions for handling the former president's testimony,
would not be fair to North since it would not be ``live for the
jury.''
   One of the charges against North is that he lied to Attorney
General Edwin Meese III when he investigated the Iran-Contra
affair, a fact Simon noted by saying, ``We have for the first time
a presidential fact-finding inquiry being the source of a criminal
charge.''
   He also recalled testimony that Reagan had admonished aides not
to disclose to Congress that the Saudi Arabian government had
contributed millions of dollars for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The prosecution wound up its case Thursday with testimony from a
witness who told of muttering ``Jeez, that can't be'' when he saw
the first evidence that Iranian arms sales profits had gone to help
the Contra rebels.
   John Richardson had been sent, along with Assistant Attorney
General Bradford Reynolds, to search North's office in the White
House complex on Nov. 22, 1986 to clear up conflicts about
shipments of U.S. arms to Iran.
   ``We'd been there for some time,'' Richardson testified. ``Brad
sort of gave me a nudge under the table, handed me the document and
pointed to one paragraph.''
   That paragraph described using $12 million in ``residual funds''
from the sales ``to purchase critically needed supplies'' for the
guerrillas fighting the Nicaraguan government.
   ``I said something under my breath like `Jeez, that can't be,'''
Richardson said. ``Brad shrugged and put it back in the documents
he was working on.''
   Richardson, who was Meese's chief of staff, and Reynolds then
met Meese and Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper for lunch.
   Asked about Meese's reaction to the memo, Richardson said, ``He
was very surprised.''
   And Cooper? ``Cooper said something like `you're kidding.'''
   Three days after they found the document, then-President Reagan
and Meese announced at a news conference that they had uncovered
the money diversion. Earlier that month Reagan had admitted that
weapons had been sold to Iran in a failed attempt to free American
hostages held in Lebanon.
   National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter resigned and North,
an aide, was fired at the time the use of the arms sales money was
announced.
   Richardson was the 29th and last prosecution witness in the
trial which began Jan. 31. The defense case is scheduled to open
Monday.
   Richardson's testimony and that of Cooper before him was an
attempt by the prosecution to prove one of the 12 charges on which
North is being tried: that he lied to Meese, who was conducting a
fact-finding inquiry for the president.
   At the time they found the damaging memorandum, Richardson said,
North aide Robert Earl was wandering in and out of the office.
   He and Reynolds ran into North as they went out to lunch, he
said, and asked for files from 1985 on the Iran arms initiative.
   ``He said, `Well, you should have them all. I'll make sure you
have them when you get back. I'll get them out,''' Richardson said.
   Previous testimony has been that while they lunched with Meese,
North continued the document shredding that had occupied him deep
into the night before.
   After they returned to North's office to continue their review
of documents, North remained at his desk, Richardson said. They
heard him tell someone on the telephone that ``Both of our
governments are overreacting to this.'' Neither the other party nor
the other government were identified in court.
   North also told them that ``soon, I'm going to be back
commanding a Marine battalion. Someone's going to have to take a
hit for this,'' Richardson said.

<HEAD>Suit Seeks Expanded Rules On Asbestos In Buldings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union whose membership includes about
170,000 janitors and other building service workers filed suit
Thursday seeking expanded national regulations governing asbestos
use in buildings other than schools.
   The suit was filed by the Service Employees International Union
two days after the federal Environmental Protection Agency refused
the union's request that it draft new asbestos guidelines for
public and commercial buildings.
   An EPA spokesman said the agency would have no immediate comment
on the suit.
   Many states regulate asbestos and there are national regulations
governing asbestos use in new buildings and those under renovation.
But the suit said the government is placing workers at risk by not
expanding to public and commercial buildings far more stringent
national regulations affecting asbestos in schools.
   Those guidelines require inspections, abatement plans,
notification of workers who potentially could be exposed to
asbestos and certification of contractors who perform the
inspections or remove asbestos.
   Asbestos, used for insulation and fireproofing, has been linked
to lung cancer.
   The suit, filed in federal district court in Washington,
estimated that there are 700,000 public and commercial buildings in
the United States in which asbestos poses potential health problems.
   ``Unreasonable risk exists which requires the initiation by EPA
of a rulemaking proceeding,'' the union said in the suit, which
names the agency and its administrator, William Reilly, as
defendants.
   ``EPA is well aware that in many, perhaps most, of these
buildings, no efforts have been made to identify asbestos or to
alert building occupants so that minimal precautions may be
taken,'' SEIU President John J. Sweeney said in announcing the
filing. ``The agency's refusal to act confirms that it would rather
study risk than take control of it.''

   ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' Wendy Wasserstein's
play about one woman's voyage from the 1960s to the 1980s, won the
1989 Pulitzer Prize for drama on Thursday.
   The prize for fiction went to Anne Tyler's ``Breathing
Lessons.'' The award for general non-fiction went to ``A Bright
Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam,'' by Neil
Sheehan.
   Two history prizes were awarded, to ``Parting the Waters:
America in the King Years, 1954-63,'' by Taylor Branch, and to
``Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era,'' by James M. McPherson.
   The biography prize was won by the late Richard Ellmann for
``Oscar Wilde.'' Richard Wilbur's ``New and Collected Poems'' won
the poetry prize, while Roger Reynolds' ``Whispers Out of Time''
won for music.
   Each prize carries with it a $3,000 award.
   Wasserstein's play was an off-Broadway hit that made the move to
Broadway. It won the drama award over two other finalists, ``M.
Butterfly'' by David Henry Hwang and ``The Piano Lesson'' by August
Wilson.
   Sheehan's account of the life of a career officer in Southeast
Asia previously won the National Book Award. His book was nominated
in three categories; he won the Pulitzer for general non-fiction
and was nominated in the biography and history categories.
   Branch's book on the King years was a winner of the National
Book Critics Circle Award, as was Ellmann's biography of Wilde.
   Wasserstein previously had written numerous plays, including
``Uncommon Women and Others'' and ``Isn't It Romantic.''
   Tyler, 47, is the author of 11 novels, including ``The
Accidental Tourist,'' which was adapted to the screen in a popular
film starring William Hurt and Academy Award winner Geena Davis.
   ``Breathing Lessons'' is the story of a long-married couple and
their trip to Pennsylvania for the funeral of a friend.
   Sheehan, 52, a native of Holyoke, Mass., was the reporter for
The New York Times who wrote the Pentagon Papers stories about the
origins of the Vietnam War. A former war correspondent, he spent 16
years writing the award-winning story of John Paul Vann.
   McPherson, 52, is a professor of American history at Princeton
University who has published five books on the Civil War era.
   Ellmann had previously won the National Book Award in 1959 for a
biography of James Joyce. He died in 1987 of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, before his Wilde
biography _ acclaimed as the definitive work on the British writer
_ was published.
   Wilbur, 68, was the poet laureate of the United States until he
retired last year. He also is a renowned translator.
   Music award winner Reynolds' ``Whispers Out of Time'' premiered
on Dec. 11, 1988, at Amherst College.

   Japan urged Washington Thursday to resume talks to
ease U.S. worries over joint development of Japan's next fighter
jet and said the project was important to the security of both
nations.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Koichi Haraguchi said no date had
been set for a new round of talks on the FSX fighter but that Japan
wanted more meetings ``as quickly as possible.''
   Japan took an initial step on its part of the project Thursday
when the government signed a contract with Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, Japan's main contractor for development of the jet, the
Defense Agency said.
   Japan had set aside more than $80 million for the project in its
fiscal 1988 budget, and the agency would have lost the money if it
had not acted before the fiscal year's end on Friday.
   Seiki Nishihiro, the agency's deputy director general, left
Washington Wednesday without reaching an accord on
``clarifications'' sought by the United States on an agreement for
joint development.
   U.S. officials said the talks were continuing at ``other
levels.''
   The countries agreed last November to jointly develop the FSX.
But the White House ordered a review after congressional critics
charged that the project was an $8 billion giveaway of U.S.
technology that Japan could use to compete in the civilian airplane
industry.
   ``We think that the effective and smooth implementation of the
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is a cornerstone of security for Japan
and it's also very important for the United States as well,''
Haraguchi said before the Mitsubishi contract was signed. ``And we
think this joint development plan of FSX is an important
contribution for this arrangement.''
   Japan refused to buy U.S.-made F-16 jet fighters and initially
planned to develop its own jet to replace the F-1. But it agreed
under U.S. pressure to share the more than $6 billion project to
build 100 FSX jets.
   President Bush has said he backs the project, negotiated by the
Reagan administration, but wants safeguards for U.S. technology.
   The original agreement called for Mitsubishi and General
Dynamics to build the FSX using the F-16 as a model. Japan would
cover all the project's costs and retain control over the fighter's
design and any new technology to emerge.
   But U.S. negotiators reportedly want clarification of which side
would own the new technology and what portion of the fighters would
be constructed in the United States. They also want to know how the
sophisticated U.S. computer software used to fly the plane would be
protected.
   Criticism is mounting in Japan over Washington's handling of the
FSX issue.
   Naotoshi Sakanjo, a senior fellow at the Research Institute of
Peace and Security, called the U.S. approach unfair.
   ``They want to restrict advanced technology transfer to Japan
but, on the other hand, want any technology developed by Japan
without any conditions and want a greater share of jobs in
development and production,'' said Sakanjo, a retired vice admiral
of the Marine Self Defense Force.
   On Wednesday, 43 legislators from the governing Liberal
Democratic Party presented a petition urging the government to
proceed with development of the fighter with or without U.S. help.

   The Supreme Court is receiving what appears to
be a record amount of unsolicited advice as it considers a request
to overturn or limit its 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   ``There are moments in history that pass quietly. The period we
are entering will not,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of
the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   The justices will hear arguments April 26 in a Missouri case
that has become the most-watched battleground in the continuing
political fight over abortion.
   Missouri and the Bush administration, among others, are urging
the court to use the case to reverse or severely limit Roe vs.
Wade, the 16-year-old ruling that said women have a constitutional
right to seek abortions.
   A decision is expected by July.
   The court has received 47 ``friend-of-the-court'' briefs,
including one submitted on behalf of the administration, that
support Missouri's appeal.
   The filing deadline for similar briefs in support of those who
successfully challenged a Missouri abortion law was midnight
Thursday. Lawyers for ``pro-choice'' groups said they anticipated
that 20 or more briefs would be delivered or mailed to the court by
the deadline.
   ``As far as we are able to determine, the largest number has
been 58,'' said court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg.
   She said 58 so-called amicus briefs were filed in Regents of
University of California vs. Bakke, the case in which the court in
1978 first upheld the concept of affirmative action.
   Before Roe vs. Wade was decided, the court received 48
``friend-of-the-court'' briefs _ 42 in support of the women who
challenged a Texas ban on most abortions and six in support of the
law.
   Seven of the anticipated amicus briefs in support of abortion
rights had been received by the Supreme Court clerk's office by the
end of the business day Thursday. They included an unusual one
submitted in behalf of ``women who have had abortions and friends.''
   Pro-choice group officials personally delivered copies of that
brief, which bears the signatures of more than 3,500 women.
   ``It's crucial for the court to hear what's in the hearts and
minds of women,'' said Helen Neuborne of the NOW Legal Defense and
Education Fund.
   Michelman, noting that three Supreme Court justices were
appointed by former President Reagan, an ardent opponent of
legalized abortion, said, ``We have serious reason to be
concerned'' about the Missouri case.
   Also making the trip to the Supreme Court Thursday were three of
the women, and one man, who signed the friend-of-the-court brief.
   Gerry Robb of Gaithersburg, Md., said she had an illegal
abortion in 1959.
   She postponed the operation when she suspected the man about to
perform it was intoxicated. She later discovered the man she
thought was a doctor was an auto mechanic.
   ``I signed this brief so other women don't ever have to go to
drunk auto mechanics for an abortion,'' Ms. Robb said.
   Elissa Raiten of College Park, Md., received a legal abortion
after being told that her child would be born severely
brain-damaged. She said she signed the brief so ``safe, clean
abortions'' will remain available.
   Jennie Marsh of Great Falls, Va., had a legal abortion at age 17
in 1973, only months after the court's decision in Roe vs. Wade.
   ``It should be a woman's decision, not anyone else's,'' she said.
   Charles Brack of New York City said he signed the brief because
his cousin died during an illegal ``kitchen table abortion'' in
Chicago 24 years ago.
   At issue in the Missouri case are key provisions of an abortion
law that lower courts barred state officials from enforcing.
   Among the provisions struck down:
   _A ban on using public hospitals and other facilities for
abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.
   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or
assisting an abortion.
   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions.
   _A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus believed
to be older than 19 weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb
by testing for weight and lung capacity.
   _A declaration that ``the life of each human being begins at
conception.''
   It is possible the court will decide the Missouri case without
significantly changing its 1973 decision, but at least three other
cases apparently being held in abeyance by the justices also
challenge Roe vs. Wade.
   Those cases are from Minnesota, Ohio and Illinois.

<HEAD>NRC Approves Full-Power License For Vogtle Unit 2</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted
unanimously Thursday to authorize a full-power license for Georgia
Power Co. to operate the unit 2 reactor at its Vogtle nuclear power
plant.
   The vote came after NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. reminded a
delegation of company officials that the commission has been less
than pleased with the operation of the unit 1 reactor at Vogtle
since it was granted a full-power license in 1987.
   According to the NRC staff, the unit 1 reactor was forced to
shut down 27 times in its first year of operation because of
unexpected events. The number of similar incidents dropped to nine
in 1988 and to one so far this year.
   A. William Dahlberg, president and chief executive officer of
Georgia Power, told the commission the utility has made strong
commitments to staff training at the twin-reactor plant and to
emergency planning.
   George Bockhold, Vogtle manager, said low-power testing on the
unit 2 reactor should be completed by Friday or Saturday, clearing
the way for operation above 5 percent power. Unit 2 is not expected
to achieve full commercial operation until June.
   Vogtle has been under construction in Burke County, Ga., since
1978. The twin-reactor plant initially was designed in the early
1970s and estimated to cost $660 million. Costs eventually
escalated to nearly $9 billion.
   Georgia Power, which has primary responsibility for construction
and operation of the plant, owns 45.7 percent of the total project.
Oglethorpe Power Corp. owns 30 percent, the Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia owns 22.7 percent and the city of Dalton owns
1.6 percent.

   The nation's 773 largest school districts use
computers but have limited access to other technology and are not
planning adequately for the future, according to a survey released
Thursday.
   Nine of 10 districts reported having at least one VCR per
building and three-quarters said they could generate tests with
computers, according to the survey issued by the National School
Boards Association and Control Data Corp.
   More than 60 percent of the school districts said they were
capable of long-distance communication using computers, had a cable
TV channel for their own use and owned a videodisc player.
   The study compared school districts unfavorably to business in
that they do not seem to be anticipating technological development.
Some 90 percent of the superintendents surveyed said their
districts had a written technology plan but only 213 actually
submitted their plans, and most of those ``did not have a
comprehensive flavor,'' the report said.
   Among the technology plan shortcomings uncovered by the survey:
   _The most common focus was curriculum, but one-third of the
plans cited only computer literacy without mentioning math,
science, reading or language arts.
   _Most of the plans referred only to stand-alone computers; a
minority discussed computer networks. Only a handful of plans
addressed other technologies such as satellites, VCRs or cable TV.
   _More than half the plans were for instructional use of
computing only and a handful addressed administrative use only.
   _Many plans were drawn in 1986 or 1987 and had no evident
provisions for updating.
   The survey of 773 districts with 10,000 students or more was
conducted by the research firm of Andersen, Niebuhr and Associates
Inc. Questionnaires were returned by 5,150 superintendents, school
board presidents, technology specialists, elementary and secondary
curriculum specialists, third-party funding administrators and
administrators in charge of programs for disadvantaged children.

<HEAD>Party Chief Defends Crackdown, Trials of Dissidents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief defended
recent trials of dissidents and declared Thursday that promoters of
Western-style political pluralism are trying to ``poison social
consciousness.''
   Milos Jakes also made clear the Soviet-led invasion of of August
1968 still is officially viewed as just and leaders of the liberal
``Prague spring'' that caused it will not be forgiven.
   Karoly Grosz, leader of the Hungarian party, hinted at a meeting
of his Central Committee on Wednesday that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev had disapproved the Soviet military interventions in
Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   Jakes used a speech to the Czechoslovak party Central Committee
to condemn ``attempts by opposition forces to influence public
opinion by casting doubt on the right of the state to intervene
against unlawful activities, disrupting public order and even
(attacking) the foundations of the social system.''
   He accused opposition groups of inciting civil disobedience and
putting ``ruthless psychological pressure'' on those who disagree
with them.
   People he described as enemies of communism at home and abroad
``strive to poison social consciousness through uncertainty, to
provoke ill-considered acts, to promote political pluralism in the
bourgeois (Western) sense,'' Jakes said.
   Members of the opposition demand independent courts, ``but if
they are justly punished, simultaneously they organize petitions
with which they want to intimidate the courts,'' he asserted.
``There is no way to give in to these pressures. Laws must be valid
for everyone.''
   The party rejects a petition signed by about 2,000 well-known
artists and scientists who criticized police violence against
dissidents and the subsequent trials, the party chief said in the
speech, reported by the official news agency CTK.
   He claimed ``foremost artists'' and most members of official
artists' unions did not take part.
   Prague police broke up peaceful demonstrations in January. In
February, the government jailed banned playwright Vaclav Havel and
other leading dissidents.
   Jakes also castigated ``church structures'' and church
dignitaries who were ``abusing the religious feelings of people ...
to open up another front of the struggle against socialism
(communism).''
   Of Aexander Dubcek, then party chief, and others who led the
Prague spring reforms, he said:
   ``Some former leading officials who had to leave the Communist
Party have become active. They are trying to present themselves as
pioneers of restructuring and from this they deduce the demand for
the rehabilitation of the policy of 1968, in particular of persons
who were active then, including their comeback into political
life.''
   Gorbachev calls his reform program perestroika, the Russian word
for restructuring.
   Referring to the peaceful demonstrations of January, Jakes
declared: ``Diaologue cannot be carried out in the streets, where
people are anonymous. It must be carried out in work places,
classrooms, in meetings of citizens ... where people know each
other.''

   The Pulitzer Prize entry by David Zucchino of
The Philadelphia Inquirer, which won in the feature writing
category, was not a finalist in that category. But it was a
finalist in the category of international reporting.
   Zucchino's series on ``Being Black in South Africa'' was
relocated to feature writing _ where he captured the prize over
three other nominees, including an Inquirer co-worker.
   Those nominees were Tad Bartimus of The Associated Press, Bob
Ehlert of the Star Tribune, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Loretta
Tofani of The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   Under Pulitzer rules, juries are supposed to recommend no more
than three items from their category to the Pulitzer Board. The
Board has the final determination of the winners and can move an
item from one category to another or select a winner not among the
finalists.
   In the general news reporting category, the board passed over
the three finalists: Nancy Badertscher of the Gwinnett Daily News,
Lawrenceville, Ga.; the staff of The Billings (Mont.) Gazette; and
Justin Gillis and Lisa Getter of The Miami Herald. Instead, the
board asked the jury chairman for additional entries, and then
selected The Louisville Courier-Journal staff for its coverage of a
bus crash which killed 27 people.
   There were also three winners nominated in multiple categories:
   _Donald L. Bartlett and James B. Steele of The Philadelphia
Inquirer, who won for national reporting, were also nominated in
public service for their 15-month investigation by of ``rifle
shot'' provisions in the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
   _Bill Dedman of The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, a winner
for investigative reporting, was also a nominee in the public
service category.
   _Neil Sheehan, author of ``A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann
and America in Vietnam,'' was nominated in three categories: he won
the Pulitzer for general non-fiction and was a finalist in the
history and biography categories.

   President Bush, who has shown a fondness for
viewing capital life while riding in his security-shrouded
limousine, took a detour on the way home from a speech Thursday to
view cherry-blossom trees.
   Bush's motorcade swept past the White House complex en route
home from a speech at a city hotel, and the president and first
lady Barbara Bush got a slow-ride through the scenic parkway
quadrant of the city.
   The police-escorted motorcade never came to a stop as the Bushes
viewed the springtime scenery, although the president's black
limousine moved at a very slow pace as he was taken past the Tidal
Basin, Haines Point and the Jefferson Memorial.
   Bush has proven to be an observant president as he rides through
the city, recently noting the homeless people sitting on grates and
telling an audience he was determined to help them get shelter.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the
legislative elections, in which dozens of official candidates lost,
show Soviet voters support the Communist Party's reform program.
   He told leaders of media organizations that elections were a
``further advancement of the policy of perestroika (reform), of the
entire democratic process,'' the official news agency Tass reported
Thursday.
   Pravda, the party newspaper, made a similar comment in its
Wednesday edition.
   Tass said Gorbachev spoke to the media officials Wednesday at
party headquarters and quoted him as saying: ``We are taking the
first steps in political reforms.''
   At least three dozen ranking local officials around the country
failed in bids for election last Sunday to the Congress of People's
Deputies parliament.
   Among the most notable was Yuri Solovyev, a candidate member of
the ruling Politburo who ran unopposed in Leningrad but was
defeated by the ``no'' vote.
   In his speech, Gorbachev said voters ``sharply raised the
question of protecting perestroika against attacks by demagogues of
all sorts and anti-Soviet elements.''
   About 80 percent of party members won their races, Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said this week. He
said local party organizations would review why individual party
members lost.

<HEAD>10 Cubans Held After Publication of Underground Newsletter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prominent human rights activist Samuel
Martinez Lara and nine other Cubans were arrested hours after an
underground newsletter came out criticizing government policies,
another activist said Thursday.
   The 10 were arrested late Wednesday afternoon, and by Thursday
all but Martinez Lara and three others were released, said Elizardo
Sanchez, president of the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and
National Reconciliation.
   Martinez Lara is secretary-general of the Pro-Human Rights Party
of Cuba and is a Sanchez ally.
   Sanchez said the four were promised a speedy trial, which
normally means a fine or several months' detention.
   The arrests followed distribution of a two-page newsletter,
Franqueza (Frankness), published by Martinez Lara.
   Martinez Lara noted the scheduled visit this Sunday of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev _ the first visit here by a Soviet
leader in 16 years _ and drew a comparison between modern-day Cuba
and the era when the Soviet people had to wear ``a Stalinist
muzzle.''
   Sanchez said Martinez Lara is a psychiatrist who was imprisoned
twice previously. He was convicted in 1982 for trying to leave the
country illegally and served a three-year prison term, and later
drew a four-month term starting in late 1986 as part of a general
crackdown on dissidents, Sanchez said.
   He reported that Martinez Lara's organization has hundreds of
members.
   Two days ago, the groups headed by Sanchez and Martinez Lara
joined forces with a third organization to coordinate human rights
activities. Sanchez said the new group represents more than 90 per
cent of Cuban human rights activists.
   The group, Umbrella 4970, said in a statement Tuesday it
welcomes Gorbachev's visit, describing him as ``one of the great
social reformers of our time.''
   While stopping short of making an appeal to Gorbachev, the
statement said previous Soviet governments contributed to the
establishment in Cuba of ``oversized repressive machinery ... (at
a) high human cost for our people.''
   The Cuban government under President Fidel Castro has long
maintained it has an exemplary human rights record. It contends
that few countries can match Cuba's performance in providing
eduation, health care and employment opportunities for its people.
   Castro and hundreds of thousands of Havana residents are
expected to greet Gorbachev on Sunday.
   ``Probably never before in the history of humanity have there
been such fraternal relations between such a powerful country and
such a small one,'' the Cuban Communist Party newspaper Gramma said
in an editorial Thursday.
   Rolando Cairo, Communist Party leader of Havana Province, said
612,000 people promised to turn out Sunday to greet the Soviet
leader.
   Gramma quoted Victor Volki, director of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, as saying the visit is to demonstrate ``the determined
support of the Soviet Union for Cuba against any attempt against
the right of its people to march down its chosen path.''
   Leonid Brezhnev in 1973 was the last Soviet leader to visit Cuba.
   Gorbachev and his wife Raisa are scheduled to stay three days in
Cuba.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Thursday stepped up
its appeal to the Soviet Union to change course in Central America,
urging the Soviets to take steps to further peace in Nicaragua and
halt the flow of arms to the region.
   In remarks by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, by Vice
President Dan Quayle and by spokesmen at the White House and State
Department, the administration signaled that the upcoming visit to
Cuba by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev would be a good opportunity
for the Soviets to indicate a new direction.
   ``We are looking for signs of new thinking,'' Baker said in a
speech in Atlanta. ``The Soviet Union now has an opportunity to
demonstrate it in Central America.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Gorbachev has
been made aware ``in the past and recently'' of President Bush's
thinking that the Soviets should stop shipping arms to the region,
or use their influence to push Nicaragua's ruling Sandinistas to
abide by regional peace accords and make democratic reforms.
   Fitzwater, when asked what the United States might be willing to
do for the Soviets in return, told reporters the administration
sees Soviet performance in the region as ``interrelated'' with
other aspects of U.S.-Soviet relations.
   While stating he could not discuss specific diplomatic
overtures, Fitzwater said, ``The president has made his views known
to Secretary General Gorbachev on this issue. We would like to see
the Soviet Union ... use its influence in Nicaragua to bring about
a peaceful settlement of the situation.''
   ``We would like to see the Soviet Union withdraw their resources
and support in Nicaragua,'' he said. ``And we would like to see
Secretary Gorbachev take an active role in furthering both of those
objectives.''
   Baker, speaking to a conference in Atlanta hosted by former
presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford, said of Central
America: ``We must send a clear message to others outside this
hemisphere: this is not a dumping ground for their arms or their
failed ideology.''
   Quayle, in an interview with Cable News Network, said, ``Central
and Latin America is in our hemisphere. It is in our own backyard.
We do not want to have outsiders coming in and subsidizing ...
exportation of revolution in our hemisphere.''
   And, at the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
the Soviet Union and Cuba, ``through their continued aid and
support of violence and subversion in the region have been
undermining the prospects for peaceful resolution'' of the
Nicaraguan war.
   Fitzwater said Baker had discussed that position recently with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Bush on different occasions has voiced his feeling that the
Soviet Union has less of an interest in the region than does the
United states.
   The Central American peace efforts are expected to be central to
separate meetings Bush will hold next week with El Salvador's
incoming president, Alfredo Cristiani, and with Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias, who has been a leader in pushing regional
peace solutions in Central America. Bush also is expected to
discuss the issue on Saturday when he sees Venezuela's President
Carlos Andres Perez to talk about the Latin debt crisis.
   Bush began publicly stepping up the pressure on the Soviet Union
in remarks March 24 when he announced the administration's plan to
keep the Contra rebels alive with an extension of nonlethal aid. He
blasted the Soviet Union and Cuba for ``continued aid and support
of violence and subversion in Central America.''
   He also said that U.S. officials see Gorbachev's upcoming trip
to Cuba as ``an important opportunity for both the Soviet Union and
Cuba to end all aid that supports subversion and destabilization in
Central America.''
   Gorbachev arrives in Havana Sunday for a three-day visit to the
closest Soviet ally in the Western Hemisphere.
   U.S. officials estimate the Soviet bloc has given at least $50
billion in aid to Cuba and Nicaragua combined over the last decade.
   They estimate that the Soviets provide $1 billion a year to
Nicaragua alone, about half in military aid and the other half in
economic assistance.
   The United States for the past eight years has provided about
$300 million in military and humanitarian aid to the Contra rebels
trying to overthrow the Sandinista government, and has imposed a
trade embargo on the once-flourishing commerce between the United
States and the Central American nation.
   U.S. officials have indicated that positive moves on the part of
the Soviets toward Nicaragua would merit consideration in weighing
improved economic relations between the two superpowers.
   ``It would certainly help in improving U.S.-Soviet relations,
East-West relations in general,'' Fitzwater said. ``The
interrelationship of all these issues is readily apparent,'' he
added when asked about linkage between the Central America
situation and overall U.S.-Soviet economic and trade ties.
   Baker repeated the Bush administration's pledge to seek a
diplomatic solution to the Central American question.
   However, Baker said, `'the United States will never support a
paper agreement that sells out the Nicaraguan people's right to be
free.'' Nor, he said, ``should any other democracy in this
hemisphere.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockets fired by Syrian troops in their
battle with Christian army units hit the city's main fuel depot
Thursday, causing fires and explosions that forced 50,000 residents
to flee.
   A witness reached by telephone said: ``Butane is leaking from
nearby tanks and exploding in balls of fire over Dora,'' where the
depot is located in Christian east Beirut.
   Police said Syrian gunners fired at least six Katyusha rockets
into east Beirut, killing two people and wounding three. He said
shrapnel and glass shards from the gas explosions wounded 14 people.
   Thursday's casualties brought the toll to 125 killed and 405
wounded in the artillery duel that began March 8 between the 20,000
Christian troopers commanded by Gen. Michel Aoun and an alliance of
Syrian forces and Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia. Most of the
casualties are civilians.
   Explosions at the fuel depot could be heard all over the
capital. Police said the blasts shattered glass within a three-mile
radius and about 50,000 people had been evacuated from the densely
populated residential districts around Dora.
   ``More tanks are full of butane and other types of gas,'' a
police spokesman said. ``If the fire reaches them we will face a
catastrophe.''
   Butane in small tanks or bottles is used for cooking stoves and
many heaters. Power plants have been heavily damaged and nearly all
facilities from hospital operating rooms to bakeries use generators
fueled by diesel or gasoline, also stored at Dora.
   A relay station at Jamhour, in Christian territory east of
Beirut, was hit by Syrian shellfire Tuesday, and Beirut now gets
electricity less than four hours a day.
   Aoun, who also leads an interim Christian government that
competes with a Moslem cabinet, urged ``humanitarian organizations
to shoulder their responsibilities and prevent the spread of this
barbaric Syrian crime.''
   His statement said the Arab League should send its six-member
mediation committee on Lebanon to see first-hand ``the war of
annihilation carried out by the Syrian occupation forces against
the Lebanese people.''
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press later, he
said the Syrians were committing ``a criminal act against the
population. They bomb the gas stations, fuel depots of the city and
the center of electricity production.''
   Jumblatt's militia began shooting two days after Aoun's forces
blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias, which cost the
government's five legal ports an estimated $100 million a year in
revenue.
   The conflict stems from a political crisis that began in
September, gave birth to the competing governments and split the
military on sectarian lines. Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib commands the
22,000 Moslem soldiers, who are poorly equipped and have stayed out
of the fighting.
   Nasrallah Sfeir, the Maronite Catholic patriarch, issued a
statement Thursday pleading for a ``consolidated cease-fire,
guaranteed by observers ... to save man in Lebanon.''
   Voice of Lebanon, a Christian radio station, said: ``Damascus,
like any invader, wants to reduce Lebanon into mere fire and
ashes,'' and urged the ``free world not to remain silent regarding
Syria's acts of terrorism.''
   Neighboring Syria has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a
under a peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League issued in 1976, a
year after the civil war began, and has become the country's main
power broker.
   Aoun has blames the Syrians for the current violence, the worst
in four years, and has vowed to drive them out.
   More than 250,000 of Beirut's 1.2 million people have deserted
the city for south Lebanon or other safer areas since the rain of
shells and rockets began more than three weeks ago.
   Christians leave their besieged 310-square-mile enclave by ship
for the ``security zone'' Israel maintains, with the aid of a
predominantly Christian militia, just inside south Lebanon. Moslems
drive south in long convoys.
   President Amin Gemayel chose Aoun, a fellow Maronite, to lead an
interim government in September when his six-year term ended and
Parliament could not agree on a successor. Moslems rejected the
choice and supported Salim Hoss, the Sunni Moslem who was premier
under Gemayel.
   By unwritten agreement dating to independence from France in
1943, the president is Christian, the premier Sunni and the
parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.

   The disputed investigation into Canada's worst
aviation disaster _ the 1985 Gander crash that killed 256 Americans
_ will be reviewed by a retired Supreme Court judge who could
recommend a new inquiry.
   Retired Judge Willard Estey, named Wednesday to review the
Aviation Safety Board's three-year investigation, will have 90 days
to deliver his report.
   Transport Minister Benoit Bouchard made clear the review will
stop short of the full judicial inquiry demanded by the
investigation's critics. But he told a news conference in Ottawa
that Estey could approve the board's report or decide further
investigation or even a full inquiry is merited.
   ``Justice Estey can recommend whatever he wants,'' Transport
Ministry spokesman Rene Mercier said in a phone interview Thursday.
``So it's from A to Z in terms of possibilities.''
   The Arrow Air charter DC-8 crashed shortly after takeoff from
Gander, Newfoundland, on a refueling stop Dec. 12, 1985, carrying
248 U.S. troops home to Fort Campbell, Ky., from Middle East
peacekeeping duties. The eight American crew also died.
   Bouchard asked Estey in a letter ``to review the entire record
of the investigation ... (and) consider whether any other
explanation as to the causes and contributing factors of the
accident is consistent with the evidence gathered by the board.''
   The minister said public confidence in the nine-member board
``has been jeopardized'' by internal division during the
investigation, which found in December that ice on the wings
probably caused the crash.
   Five members approved the final report. Four said in a minority
report that an in-flight fire or explosion was the most likely
cause.
   Demands to reopen the investigation have been heard ever since.
   The Toronto Star said in an editorial this month: ``A total of
256 people died in the Gander crash. Their families and friends,
not to mention Canadians who rely on Ottawa for air safety, now
deserve a public inquiry.''
   Bouchard had expressed his confidence in the board's
investigation and accepted the icing theory. The Ottawa Citizen,
however, obtained an internal Transportation Ministry report that
said board investigators mismanaged the probe and focused on a
``preconceived'' icing theory at the expense of other possible
causes.
   Bouchard also named a judge to handle an investigation of the
March 10 crash of an Air Ontario Fokker F-28 jet that killed 24
people at Dryden, Ontario, although the safety board already sent
its own investigators to the scene.
   ``The actions I have taken will assist in restoring the
credibility'' of accident investigations, he said.

<HEAD>New Safety Inspection Ordered for Grounded Bomber Fleet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Air Force has inspected 34 of its B-1B
bombers without finding more problems with a wing mechanism that
malfunctioned earlier this week but has decided a more extensive
safety inspection is needed.
   ``We have decided to devise another type of inspection, a more
thorough inspection in the same wing area, in the interests of
safety to ensure we're looking at everything we need to look at,''
said Col. Larry Greer, a spokesman for the Strategic Air Command.
   The earlier malfunction prompted the Air Force to ground its
B-1B fleet on Tuesday as a precautionary measure.
   ``The standdown (grounding) is still in effect for the time
being,'' Greer said.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard had predicted earlier Thursday
that the grounding order might be lifted shortly.
   Greer said later, however, from SAC headquarters in Omaha, Neb.,
that Air Force engineers had decided to be extra careful and delay
the resumption of training flights.
   The malfunction occurred Monday afternoon at Dyess Air Force
Base, Texas, during a routine pre-flight check by the pilots.
   The crew couldn't get the plane's wings to move back and forth
in tandem and at one point, the left wing apparently moved too far
forward and punctured the seam of a fuel tank inside the fuselage.
   Howard said Thursday the Air Force had removed the gear box that
controls the movement or sweep of the left wing on that plane and
sent it to the Sundstrand Corp., its maker, for a detailed analysis.
   ``The specific problem having to do with the wings operating out
of sync fractured a coupling on a hard shaft that connects the gear
boxes on the two wings,'' Howard said. ``But we don't know yet if
that was the first cause or a result of a mechanical failure in the
gear box.''
   Greer said he did not know if the decision to conduct another
safety check had been prompted by the work at Sundstrand.
   The B-1B is the nation's newest long-range bomber. To improve
its performance, the plane features wings that can be swept forward
or backward in flight. The wings are normally swept back for
high-speed attack runs and forward for takeoffs and landings.
   The four-engine B-1B is the first new addition to the manned
bomber force in more than 25 years. Built by the Rockwell
International Corp., the B-1B has a maximum speed of about 1,000
mph and a range of more than 7,000 miles.
   The Air Force built 100 of the planes during the Reagan
administration to modernize the old B-52 bomber force while it
developed the new B-2 stealth bomber. Three have been lost in
accidents.
   While the future of the B-2 is now unclear because of budget
cutbacks, the B-1B continues to have problems of its own. Besides
the three crashes, the plane still suffers from problems with its
electronic warfare _ or radar jamming _ gear.

   Canada and the Palestine Liberation
Organization held their first official meeting Thursday after the
Canadian government lifted its restrictions on high-level contacts
with the PLO.
   Canadian U.N. Ambassador L. Yves Fortier met with the PLO's
second-ranking U.N. diplomat, M. Nassar Kidwa, for about 20 minutes
at Canada's U.N. Mission.
   ``We reviewed the Middle East question in a very general way,
and we had a constructive discussion,'' Fortier said. ``This is a
first step.''
   Kidwa said, ``The ambassador informed me about the decision of
the government of Canada to end restrictions on contacts between
Canadian officials and the PLO, as well as Canada's endorsement of
the principle of self-determination for the Palestinian people.''
   Canada's foreign minister, Joe Clark, said at a news conference
in Ottawa that Canada endorses the principle of self-determination
for the Palestinian people through peace negotiations, but that it
does not recognize the Palestinian state the PLO proclaimed in
November.
   In December, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said his group renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Clark said those moves ``largely address'' critical Canadian
concerns about the organization.
   The United States resumed contacts with the PLO in January after
Arafat's announcement and since has held two rounds of meetings
with PLO officials. The United States, however, also has refused to
recognize the Palestinian state, which the PLO has said would
include the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   There had been speculation about a foreign policy rift between
Clark and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who said on a trip to
London this month that Canada should move cautiously in improving
relations with the PLO.
   Fortier said Canada's ``friendship with Israel has always been
and remains a cornerstone of our foreign policy.''
   Israel has refused to accept an independent Palestinian state
and rejects negotiations with the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist organization.
   B'nai B'rith Canada, a Jewish human rights organization, said it
deeply regretted the meeting between Fortier and Kidwa.
   The PLO should not be recognized as a representative of
Palestinian interests, said B'nai B'rith president Brian Feldman in
Toronto.
   ``It's not a group that can be trusted,'' he said.

   Thousands of riot police staged an
air, land and sea assault Thursday to end a violent strike that
paralyzed the Hyundai shipyard _ the country's largest _ for more
than three months. About 700 workers were arrested.
   Thousands of radical students protesting the intervention
battled police and attacked Hyundai facilities in six cities. In
the capital of Seoul, about a dozen students attacked an auto
showroom and destroyed three cars, the South Korean news agency
Yonhap said.
   About 14,000 riot police, assisted by helicopters pouring down
tear gas, stormed Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan before dawn to
quell the strike that had left more than 400 people injured since
Dec. 12.
   News reports said at least 54 more people were injured in
Thursday's police operation.
   The shipyard in Ulsan, about 150 miles southeast of Seoul, is
owned by the Hyundai Group, one of the nation's largest
conglomerates, which produces cars, ships, electronics, steel and
other products.
   Hyundai said it lost $6 million in sales daily during the strike.
   The police action came as the government took a tough stand on
an increasingly militant labor movement. Officials said the
government will use police to end all illegal labor protests in the
future.
   Police in combat fatigues and visored helmets stormed the
sprawling shipyard via land and sea routes. Two helicopters fired
tear gas and a third helicopter was used as a command post.
   Most of the 1,000 picketing workers fled to nearby dormitories,
where they battled police with firebombs, rocks and steel pipes.
   Workers refused a police order to surrender. Air mattresses were
spread around the five-story dormitories to prevent suicides.
   Police firing tear gas raced up fire escapes and down hallways
of the company dormitories to drag out hiding strikers. Police
arrested 700 workers, but most strike leaders escaped before police
moved in.
   Windows were smashed with rocks and clubs as riot police entered
buildings to drag out workers.
   Tear gas drifted over the shipyard and into nearby residential
areas. Yonhap said about 2,000 family members and supporters of the
strikers were dispersed by tear gas after they harassed police.
   Hyundai's trouble began Dec. 12 when militant workers broke away
from a company-sanctioned labor union and set up a separate union
of their own, demanding hefty pay hikes and the rehiring of
hard-line union leaders dismissed earlier.
   Management refused to recognize the new militant union, and
1,000 to 5,000 of the yard's 22,000 workers have been involved in
violent clashes with pro-management workers.
   About 1,000 students at Ulsan University were dispersed by riot
police with tear gas when they tried to march from the campus to
the shipyard to join the strikers, Yonhap said.
   In the southern city of Changwon, 1,800 workers at Hyundai
Precision Co., another subsidiary of the conglomerate, rallied in
support of the striking workers and demanded the government stop
suppressing union activity.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, bands of 10 to 40 students
armed with firebombs and steel pipes attacked two Hyundai offices
and an automobile showroom, Yonhap said.
   In Pusan, a coastal city 30 miles south of the shipyard, about
400 students battled riot police to support the Hyundai strikers.
Similar clashes were reported in Seoul, Chonju and Chonnan, reports
said.

   Amateur photographer Ron Olshwanger knew right
away that his picture of a firefighter breathing life into the limp
body of a little girl was extraordinary, but never imagined that it
would win a Pulitzer Prize.
   On Thursday, the picture won the Pulitzer award for spot news
photography.
   ``I was at the right place at the right time,'' Olshwanger said
in an interview before joining a celebration in the newsroom of the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which first published his picture.
   ``Who'd have ever thought I'd win a Pulitzer Prize?'' said
Olshwanger, co-owner of a furniture wholesaling business. ``I'd
figure I have a better chance of flying to the moon.''
   The picture shows firefighter Adam Long giving mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation to 2-year-old Patricia Pettus after she was pulled
from a fire in her home in St. Louis on Dec. 30. Long was
resuscitating the girl while carrying her naked and soot-covered
body out of the burning house. She was rushed to a hospital, but
she died on Jan. 5.
   Olshwanger, 51, said what made the picture so touching was that
``it showed one human being helping another. Pure and simple.''
   The picture was distributed nationally and internationally by
The Associated Press. Olshwanger said he has been contacted by
people around the world who have seen the photograph and told him
they cried.
   ``I hope that little girl didn't die in vain,'' Olshwanger said.
``When people saw the picture, I hope it made them think how
important it is to check smoke detectors and that it made them
realize what firefighters face every day.''
   Although Olshwanger is not a firefighter, he's a director of a
suburban fire protection district and has a son who is a
firefighter for a nearby fire department.
   Olshwanger said he takes pictures of fires as a hobby; usually,
he gives them to fire departments for use in training programs or
however they wish.
   ``I don't take pictures around the house, of the family, because
my wife tells me that they don't turn out very well,'' said
Olshwanger. ``They're always lopsided or fuzzy. But when I took
that picture that morning, I knew it was something special.''
   So did editors of the Post-Dispatch, who quickly acquired rights
to it.
   Post-Dispatch Editor William Woo and Managing Editor David
Lipman greeted Olshwanger and his wife, Sally, in the newsroom
after the award was announced. Lipman said Olshwanger was one of
the most civic-minded people he had ever met.
   ``He's refused to take one penny for the rights to the
picture,'' Lipman said. ``Every cent has gone to the family of the
little girl.''

   Rebellious inmates
Thursday ended a five-day uprising that left at least seven people
dead and subjected hundreds of women and children trapped inside
the prison to hunger, cold and fear.
   The government signed an accord with the mutinous inmates that
calls for replacing Pavon prison's authorities and entire guard
corps and ``to guarantee the absolute physical integrity'' of the
rebels.
   ``There were neither victors or vanquished,'' said prison
spokesman Conrado Monroy of the rebellion's conclusion. ``The
object was to avoid more deaths, and that was done.''
   He said a new director and warden had been named and that the
guards would be replaced ``within days.''
   At least four guards and three inmates were killed in the
uprising at the country's largest prison, 15 miles east of
Guatemala City. The rebels had demanded guaranteed pardons for
crimes committed during the revolt, but the government said only
Congress can pardon crimes.
   Interior Minister Roberto Valle Valdizan, the government's
special attorney general for human rights, and three
representatives of an estimated 100 rebel inmates signed the accord
a day after authorities cut off food, water and electricity to the
crowded prison.
   Firefighters and Red Cross workers evacuated friends and
relatives of inmates caught inside the prison by the revolt, which
authorities said began on Easter Sunday as a mass escape.
   Prison authorities began a roll call of the inmates and an
inventory to account for weapons.
   Monroy said the rebels handed over 61 carbines they seized
Sunday.
   Judge Daniel Marroquin of neighboring San Jose Pinula said
several rifles appeared to be missing but that some may have been
destroyed.
   He said the official death toll remained at seven. Other bodies
were reportedly on the grounds, but he said he had not had the
opportunity to make a thorough search.
   About 600 people, mostly women and children, were visiting the
prison when the uprising began and most remained inside with the
inmates. Authorities differed on whether they were hostages or
whether they stayed to protect loved ones from security force
reprisals.
   By midafternoon Thursday, about a third of the family members
had been taken from the prison grounds, and officials said the rest
would be removed during the night.
   About 110 prisoners who did not participate in the rebellion
fled the prison Wednesday and were taken into custody. Twenty
relatives of inmates also made their way out over the past few days.
   The rebelling inmates reportedly held key sections of the
2.5-square-mile institution.
   Though Guatemala is in the tropics, its elevation makes for
bitingly chilly nights with temperatures in the low 50s. Many
inside the prison had to shiver through nights huddled in scarce
blankets or curled up on cold concrete floors.
   The rebels have been described as hardened criminals serving
long sentences for crimes such as murder and kidnapping. They
reportedly include former security force members.
   More than 1,000 soldiers and police had massed outside the
prison gates since the uprising began. They were under orders from
President Vinicio Cerezo not to take action unless the prisoners
tried to shoot their way out.
   Pavon Model Correction Facility, designed to hold 800 prisoners,
had about 1,350 inmates when the uprising began.
   In the accord, the government also pledged a nationwide prison
reform but not say precisely what would be done. Virtually all of
the nation's prisons are badly crowded.
   The government also promised to relay to ``the pertinent
authorities'' the rebels' request for pardons for crimes committed
during the uprising; guarantee the ``absolute physical integrity''
of the rebels after surrender; promote the ``strict application''
of a law providing for reduction of prison sentences through work;
and present Congress with a proposal for a nationwide reduction of
all prison sentences by five years.
   Cerezo said Tuesday that international drug traffickers may have
paid bribes or fees to the uprising's ringleaders to arrange the
escape of several convicted traffickers incarcerated at Pavon.
   Prison authorities said several Colombians serving drug-related
sentences were not involved in the uprising. Authorities said the
Colombians kept out of the takeover drama in a section of the
prison they have staked out as their private domain.

   Marta Abal Reyes went 30 hours
without a sip of water and for two days ate only pumpkin leaves.
But she said Thursday that was not the worst of her ordeal inside
Pavon prison.
   ``My nerves are killing me,'' she said, tears in her eyes, as
she sat in the back of a Red Cross ambulance that carried her and
seven other women and children to the organization's Guatemala City
headquarters for medical checkups.
   They were among 575 people _ mostly women and children _
evacuated from Pavon penitentiary Thursday after the end of a
four-day revolt by inmates.
   Many children showed signs of dehydration, said Dr. Gabriel
Salazar of the Red Cross.
   Authorities cut off food and water to the prison on Wednesday in
an effort to pressure the rebellious inmates to surrender.
   ``I was afraid,'' said Mrs. Reyes, who was trapped inside Sunday
while paying an Easter visit to her husband, Feliciano, a prisoner.
``I would get desperate, then recover my spirits, but you never
knew what was going to happen.''
   Georgina Lopez, escorted out of the prison with her two young
children, said: ``We were locked up by the mutineers. That was
hard.''
   Some officials suggest earlier in the week that family members
might have chosen to remain in the prison to support the rebel
inmates' demands.
   ``That's a lie. Why on earth would we want to stay in there
under those conditions?'' Ms. Lopez asked.
   ``The bullets made us scared,'' Eva Estrada said of the sporadic
gunfire heard in the prison throughout the week.
   Mrs. Estrada and several other women interviewed were concerned
about the fate of prisoners who did not take part in the uprising.
   She said no more than 50 of the prison's 1,350 inmates
participated. Authorities had estimated the number of rebel
prisoners at 100.
   ``Now we're afraid the army or the prison guards could take
reprisals against innocent people,'' Mrs. Reyes said.
   The government promised ``to guarantee absolute respect for the
physical integrity'' of the inmates.

<HEAD>Study Says Soviet Leader Cut Deal With KGB to Enhance Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev cut
an expensive deal with the KGB to defeat a serious challenge to his
political reforms, a private Kremlinologist says in a study being
released Friday.
   The September 1988 bargain placed KGB chief Viktor Chebrikov in
a position to influence constitutional revisions and possibly
become a candidate for supreme power himself, said researcher
Jeremy Azrael, a former State Department policy planner.
   Azrael said Chebrikov is believed to be uneasy with the pace of
reform in the country.
   ``Gorbachev is in an uphill battle,'' Azrael wrote in a summary
of the study. ``He won a very narrow victory based on cutting a
deal with the head of the KGB, who is on record as being dubious
about his policies. Chebrikov is not only the chief contender
should Gorbachev go belly-up, but someone who is evidently willing
to give him a shove in that direction.''
   Azrael's analysis comes in a study by the Rand Corp., a
government-supported think tank. The $137,000 study was done for
the government-funded National Council for Soviet and East European
Research and the Center for the Study of Soviet International
Behavior, a joint operation of Rand and the University of
California at Los Angeles.
   The study doesn't address the implications of the Soviet Union's
weekend elections for a new national congress, the most competitive
elections there since 1917. Embarrassing defeats for many Communist
Party regulars raised the possibility of a backlash against
Gorbachev's reforms.
   Gorbachev may have headed off a bloodless coup of the kind that
deposed Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1964 through the intercession of
the KGB, the Soviet secret police and intelligence agency, at a
September 1988 plenum of the party's Central Committee, Azrael
writes.
   However, the researcher suggests that a humiliating defeat of
his political reforms, rather than his ouster, was the more likely
intent of a group of Gorbachev adversaries that included his chief
rival, Yegor Ligachev.
   ``It was only after Chebrikov made it clear that the KGB was
firmly on Gorbachev's side, and was prepared to play political
hardball on his behalf, that Gorbachev's opponents relented,'' the
study says.
   Ligachev was demoted from his No. 2 position in the party and
several other Gorbachev opponents on the Politburo were retired
after the meeting.
   In contrast, KGB chief Chebrikov was made secretary of the
party's Central Committee, and his allies were installed to head
the Committee on Party Control and the KGB itself.
   Azrael disagreed with those who believe that the political power
of the KGB has waned in recent years.
   Before the pivotal September 1988 Central Committee plenum,
Azrael writes, Chebrikov undermined Gorbachev's liberalization
programs by engineering the ouster of prominent Gorbachev ally
Boris Yeltsin from party leadership.
   There also is evidence the KGB encouraged ethnic violence in the
Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan in the spring and summer
of 1988 to demonstrate the dangers of rapid political
liberalization, Azrael wrote.

   Walt Disney Co. filed suit Thursday against
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, alleging
unauthorized use of its Snow White character in what it called an
unflattering opening number of the nationally televised awards
ceremony.
   The Wednesday night show began with an actress dressed as Snow
White being interviewed in the lobby of the Shrine Auditorium, and
then following a chorus line of dancing stars down an aisle to the
stage.
   In a Betty Boop voice, Snow White then sang spoofs of popular
songs rewritten with Oscar-oriented lyrics, to the embarrassment of
stars she called attention to in the front rows of the Shrine.
   Many critics panned the production number as arcane, glitzy and
overdone. The show was broadcast live on ABC-TV. The network was
not part of the lawsuit.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, alleges copyright
infringement of Disney's Snow White character, unfair competition
and violation of the California anti-dilution law. The law protects
the value of a legal trademark.
   Disney filed suit after the Academy refused its request for a
public apology, according to a statement from Frank Wells, Disney's
president and chief operating officer.
   No monetary damages were specified, although Disney is seeking a
court order prohibiting the Academy's future use of Disney
characters without authorization, said company spokesman Erwin Okun.
   Wells said Disney officials were ``greatly surprised and
dismayed when we viewed last evening's Academy Awards ceremonies to
see that our Snow White character had been used extensively without
our permission.''
   Disney, which has a fearsome reputation for protecting its
property and characters, added that ``We have reluctantly taken
this action against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
to make sure that our rights are fully protected under the law.''
   Bruce Davis, the Academy's executive administrator, declined
comment on the suit, saying, ``Not only do not have any comment,
but we haven't even seen it.
   ``This is kind of a down day at the Academy,'' Davis added.
``We're not very organized the day after the Academy Awards.''
   Davis added that he was unaware of details about Disney's
request for a public apology.
   ``I'll try to be more helpful tomorrow,'' Davis said.
   In his statement, Wells said, ``We requested of the Academy only
that it admit to its unauthorized portrayal of Snow White and for a
public apology for having used our copyrighted works without first
receiving Disney's consent. If such a statement had been agreed to
by the Academy, we would have considered the matter ended.
   ``For its own reasons, however, the Academy unfortunately did
not accede to our request.''
   ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' was released by Disney in
1937 and was the studio's first feature-length animated cartoon.
Critics praised the film, calling it a turning point in Disney's
career and a milestone in movie history.

   Xiao Jingguang, former commander of the Chinese
navy and vice minister of defense, died at the age of 86, the
official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday.
   Xiao, who also served as vice chairman of China's legislature,
the National People's Congress, died Wednesday, Xinhua said. The
cause of death was not available.
   Xinhua said Xiao was born in the southern city of Changsha, near
the birthplace of Mao Tse-tung, and joined the Chinese Communist
Party in 1922, a year after its founding, while studying in Moscow.
   He returned to China in 1924 and served in various posts in the
Red Army, including political commissar of the 11th army and
commander of the Fujian-Jiangxi Military Area. He held senior posts
during the Long March of 1935-36, the war against Japan and the
civil war with the Nationalists.
   Xiao rose to the rank of admiral in 1955.

   The Anchorage Daily News won the 1989 Pulitzer
Prize for public service Thursday for a series on alcoholism and
suicide among native Alaskans. The Philadelphia Inquirer and
Chicago Tribune each won two prizes.
   The public service award ``will give us a chance to reiterate
the point of the stories done in the first place: we've got a
serious problem up here,'' said Pat Dougherty, city editor of the
Daily News. The newspaper also won the public service award in 1976
for a series on the Teamsters union in Alaska.
   Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele of the Inquirer won the
national reporting prize for a 15-month investigation of provisions
in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that gave special tax breaks to many
politically connected individuals and businesses. The Pulitzer
Board said the series aroused so much public indignation that
Congress rejected such breaks.
   The Inquirer's David Zucchino won in feature writing for his
series ``Being Black in South Africa,'' described as ``richly
compelling'' by the judges. The Pulitzer Board had switched his
entry from the international reporting category to features.
   It was the 16th Pulitzer in 14 years for the Inquirer and the
second such prize for Barlett and Steele, who won in 1975 for
reporting on the Internal Revenue Service. Steele said doing the
series on tax breaks ``was almost like a treasure hunt. We got one
break after another. They came slow. But they were there.''
   The Chicago Tribune's winners were Clarence Page in the
commentary category, for his columns on local and national affairs,
and Lois Wille for editorial writing, who also played a major role
in the Chicago Daily News' 1963 Pulitzer for Public Service.
   The Anchorage paper's 10-day, 44-story series found that
alcoholism is rampant in rural Alaska and the suicide rate for
Eskimos and Indians is four times the national rate. The series
also detailed high rates of child abuse and other domestic
violence. The stories attributed such problems to a lack of job
opportunities and a clash of cultures between native Alaskans and
others.
   The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., was awarded the prize
for general news for coverage of a church bus crash that claimed 27
lives and its examination of the accident's cause. ``I think our
pride and jubilation has to be tempered somewhat by the subject
matter we covered,'' Publisher George Gill told staff members.
   The Courier-Journal's entry was not one of the finalists
recommended by the jury to the board. The board asked for the names
of additional nominees and chose the Courier-Journal story from
that group, said Robert Christopher, board secretary.
   Bill Dedman of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution won the
Pulitzer for investigative reporting for ``The Color of Money,'' an
investigation of alaleged racial discrimination by the city's
lending institutions. After the series, a consortium of banks
announced programs for lending at least $67 million at low
interest, especially in black neighborhoods.
   The Pulitzer for explanatory journalism went to reporter David
Hanners, photographer William Snyder and artist Karen Blessen of
The Dallas Morning News for their report on a 1986 plane crash and
its implications for air safety.
   The 12-page special section ``Anatomy of An Air Crash: The Final
Flight of 50 Sierra Kilo'' examined from start to finish the
investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board of the
crash of a jet carrying executives of a New Jersey company. The
plane went down in bad weather near Redwater, Texas, killing seven.
The NTSB report 22 months later cited controller error and
malfunctioning radar equipment.
   Edward Humes of The Orange County (Calif.) Register won the
prize for specialized reporting for his coverage of the military
establishment in Southern California.
   The Pulitzer Board awarded two prizes in international
reporting. One went to Glenn Frankel of The Washington Post for
reporting from the Middle East; the other went to Bill Keller of
The New York Times for coverage of the Soviet Union.
   ``If you wanted to know anything about the Soviet Union in the
past few years, you had to read Bill Keller,'' said Bernard
Gwertzman, acting foreign editor of the Times. Bill Drozdiak,
foreign editor of The Washington Post, said Frankel is has ``done
superb work under very difficult circumstances.''
   Jack Higgins of the Chicago Sun-Times won for his editorial
cartoons.
   In photography, amateur Ron Olshwanger won for a spot news
picture in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch of a firefighter giving
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a child pulled from a burning
building. Olshwanger, a 51-year-old furniture wholesaler, said he
was ``at the right place at the right time. Who'd have ever thought
I'd win a Pulitzer prize? I'd figure I have a better chance of
flying to the moon.''
   The Pulitzer for feature photography went to Manny Crisostomo of
the Detroit Free Press for a series of photographs depicting
student life at Southwestern High School. ``My hair's a mess, it's
got champagne all over it. This is wonderful,'' said Crisostomo.
   The prize for criticism went to Michael Skube of The News and
Observer of Raleigh, N.C., for his writing on literature.
   Each of the Pulitzers carries a $3,000 prize, except for public
service, which is recognized with a gold medal.
   In the arts categories, ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' Wendy
Wasserstein's play about a woman's life from the 1960s to the
1980s, won the prize for drama.
   ``I'm so excited, I'm almost pre-verbal,'' said Wasserstein, who
said she was sitting at home, with her cat and typewriter, writing
an essay about her mother when she found out. ``You don't think
you'll be home writing about your mother and somebody will be
calling to say you've won the Pulitzer Prize.''
   Anne Tyler's novel, ``Breathing Lessons,'' won for fiction.
   The award for general non-fiction went to ``A Bright Shining
Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam,'' by Neil Sheehan. The
book also has won a National Book Award. It had been nominated in
both the history and biography categories.
   Two history prizes were awarded, to ``Parting the Waters:
America in the King Years, 1954-63,'' by Taylor Branch, and to
``Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era,'' by James M. McPherson.
   The biography prize was won by the late Richard Ellmann for
``Oscar Wilde.'' Richard Wilbur's ``New and Collected Poems'' won
the poetry prize, and Roger Reynolds' ``Whispers Out of Time'' won
for music.

   The captain of the tanker that caused the
worst oil spill in the nation's history was fired Thursday, Exxon
Shipping Co. announced. Earlier, federal investigators said tests
taken after the accident determined he was legally drunk.
   Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood had a blood-alcohol
reading of .061 when measured nine hours after the ship rammed
Bligh Reef, said William Woody, head of a four-man NTSB team
investigating the spill.
   Under a federal law that prohibits operating a commercial vessel
at sea while intoxicated, the limit set by the Coast Guard is .04,
Woody said. For automobile drivers in Alaska and most other states,
a blood-alcohol reading of .10 is considered legally drunk.
   Hazelwood was not on the bridge when the tanker ran aground
March 24. Third mate Gregory Cousins, who the Coast Guard says
lacked proper certification, was giving the orders.
   Woody said a Coast Guard officer told investigators he smelled
alcohol on Hazelwood's breath a few hours after the accident. But
the Guardsman and a harbor pilot agreed Hazelwood appeared
competent, Woody said.
   Woody refused to answer questions concerning whether Hazelwood
might have been drinking between the time of the accident, which
occurred shortly after midnight Friday, and the time the Coast
Guard arrived at the scene at between 2 and 2:30 a.m.
   Shortly after the NTSB announcement, Exxon Shipping Co. said it
was firing Hazelwood, who has been convicted twice of drunken
driving.
   ``I do have permission to confirm that Capt. Hazelwood has been
released from the company as of today,'' said Brian Dunphy, an
Exxon spokesman. ``I'm really not in a position to make any further
comment.'' He said that to his knowledge no other member of the
ship's crew had been fired.
   On the advice of their lawyers, Hazelwood and Cousins have
refused to talk to investigators, Woody said.
   Coast Guard spokesman Todd Nelson said the agency is waiting for
final findings from the NTSB before proceeding with any criminal
charges. Such charges could lead to up to one year in prison and
not more than $5,000 in fines, according to the Coast Guard and
Marine Safety Office in Juneau.
   Penalties for operating a ship while intoxicated also include
the loss of a seaman's license and up to $1,000 in civil fines.
   Woody said there was no sign of alcohol in Cousins' blood or
urine. Nor was there any indication of alcohol in the tests
administered to helmsman Robert Kagan, he said.
   However, Woody said a civilian Coast Guard employee, who came on
duty just before the ship ran aground, tested at .20 Friday
afternoon. The employee, Bruce Blandford, was one of two people on
duty in the radar room in Valdez, where tanker traffic is monitored
as it moves through the Valdez Narrows.
   Blandford had begun work at midnight, four minutes before the
tanker accident, and stayed several hours after his normal 8 a.m.
quitting time, authorities said.
   He had been off duty for several hours when he was recalled for
the alcohol test, Woody said. He denied drinking Thursday night,
and his superiors said his performance appeared normal, Woody said.
   The Exxon Valdez was beyond the narrows at the time of the
accident, and the Coast Guard said it routinely does not monitor
ships in that area, especially when there is no other traffic and
the weather and visibility are good as they were March 24.
   Hazelwood has been arrested twice for drunken driving and had
his license suspended three times. His mother told The Associated
Press that her son had undergone rehabilitation and that Exxon was
aware of his drinking problem.

<HEAD>Haitian Officers Discharged For Drug-Running</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Four high-ranking army officers
were discharged for drug trafficking a day after a visiting U.S.
official tied resumption of U.S. aid to progress in stopping the
drug trade, reports said Thursday.
   Independent Radio Haiti Inter said the discharged officers are
Lt. Col. Rosny Casimir, Lt. Col. Serge Toussaint, Lt. Col. Lionel
Liautaud, and Lt. Col. Antoine Jean-Gilles Jr.
   Casimir, Toussaint and Liautaud were staff officers at Army
Headquarters, and Jean-Gilles was second-in-command at the
Dessalines Barracks under the late Col. Jean-Claude Paul.
   Paul, who mysteriously died in October after drinking pumpkin
soup which officials said was poisoned, was indicted by a Miami
grand jury in 1988 on three counts of drug running.
   Radio Haiti Inter and privately-owned Tele Haiti, citiing
unidentified sources of the Army High Command, said the four
officers were discharged Wednesday night for their involvement in
drug trafficking.
   The state-owned Tele Nationale also reported the discharges
Thursday night, saying it was ``for the good of the army.'' It gave
no further details or reason for the discharges.
   Tele-Haiti said an unspecified number of other unidentified
officers were discharged but not not mention the reason.
   Richard Melton, assistant undersecretary of state for Caribbean
affairs, visited Haiti on Monday and Tuesday to consult Haitian
President Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril on Haitian-American relations and
the resumption of American aid, a U.S. Embassy communique said.
   Melton said the resumption of aid depended on progress in
establishing a civilian government, respect for human rights and
stopping the narcotics trade.
   Two-thirds of the $90 million annual U.S. aid package to Haiti
was suspended after the violently aborted elections in November
1987 in which at least 34 voters were shot and hacked to death at
the polls by thugs protected by soldiers.
   Col. Gary Leon, former secretary of the Army High Command, was
convicted this month in Brooklyn, N.Y., on charges of smuggling
cocaine from Haiti, earlier this year. He is scheduled to be
sentenced in May.

   Leftist guerrilla saboteurs blasted an ore
train off the tracks Thursday on the world's highest railroad line,
killing a conductor and injuring three other crew, police said.
   The saboteurs, believed to belong to the Maoist Shining Path
organization, exploded a 35-pound dynamite bomb as the dual
locomotive train roared past.
   Police in Huancayo, a major provincial capital 140 miles east of
Lima, said the blast sent the locomotives and all five cars
careening off the tracks.
   The train was hauling copper ore to a nearby refinery when it
was derailed near Carahuacra, a village in the high Andes Mountains
60 miles northwest of Huancayo, according to police.
   The attack occurred near the 15,700-foot summit of the highest
standard gauge railroad in the world.
   The conductor, riding in the lead locomotive, was killed and two
engineers and a signalman were injured.
   Police gave no damage estimate nor did they say how long it will
take to reopen the line, which links Lima with the highlands.
   Shining Path has blown up railroad bridges and sabotaged tracks
dozens of times, seeking to foment economic chaos. The mining
industry, which traditionally accounts for more than half of Peru's
foreign exchange, depends heavily on the line to transport minerals.
   Shining Path has waged a nine-year insurgency to install Marxist
rule. The government says more than 14,000 people have died in the
violence.

<TEXT>
   A reporter who is no longer at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution won a Pulitzer Prize for his work there, and
quickly gave thanks to an editor who is no longer there either.
   Reporter Bill Dedman, who quit his job in February to join The
Washington Post, hopped a plane to Atlanta to join in the
celebration as soon as he heard the award announced on Thursday.
   Once back in the Journal-Constitution newsroom, Dedman thanked a
long list of editors and assistants. He reserved top credit for
former editor Bill Kovach, who resigned last November in a bitter
and highly publicized management dispute, and to Sonny Rawls, a
Kovach lieutenant who remains at the paper as assistant managing
editor for news.
   Dedman then accepted a plastic cup of champagne from Managing
Editor Glenn McCutchen and, referring to staff turmoil and turnover
prompted by Kovach's departure, said, ``I think we all had a rough
year, but I think this will probably taste real good.''
   Dedman's stories exposing unequal patterns of home loans to
blacks and whites in Atlanta won the Pulitzer Prize for
investigative reporting for the Journal-Constitution.
   ``We documented a social ill,'' Dedman said. ``I'm excited that
the Pulitzer Board would honor stories that tell the white
community things the black community already knew and things that
take the editor's guts to put in the newspaper.''
   Dedman and a special projects team developed the series of
stories by analyzing reams of computer printouts, obtained under
the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1977, of home loans
made by census tracts.
   Dedman, a 28-year-old college dropout who joined the Atlanta
newspapers in April 1987, spent five months developing the story on
so-called ``redlining'' of mortgage loans to blacks, who make up
two-thirds of Atlanta's population.
   The newspaper's analysis of loans made by every bank, savings
and loan association and large credit union in Atlanta from 1981 to
1986 showed that white neighborhoods received five times as many
home loans as black neighborhoods with the same income level.
   ``While our newspaper, and particularly Bill Dedman, were
honored today, Atlanta also ought to feel very good because of the
way it behaved,'' Publisher Jay Smith said. ``A lot of communities
would have gotten their backs up. ... The political leadership
said, `We've got to fix this thing and we've got to fix it in a
matter of days or weeks, not months.'''
   Journal-Constitution Editor Arnold Rosenfeld credited his
predecessor, Kovach, who is now studying as a Nieman Fellow at
Harvard.
   Kovach, reached by telephone, said, ``It's a proud day when
journalism recognizes work of this quality. I hope it stands as a
goal for which the reporters and editors there will continue to
strive.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita expressed ``deep
remorse'' to all Koreans on Thursday over Japan's militaristic past
and said his nation sought to improve relations with communist
North Korea.
   Japan ruled Korea as a colony for 35 years, until Japan's World
War II surrender in 1945.
   Takeshita spoke before a parliamentary committee as a goodwill
mission from the Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition
party, left for Beijing on its way to Pyongyang for talks with
North Korean leaders.
   The Socialists said their mission, led by former party
Secretary-General Makoto Tanabe, had the government's backing in
efforts to find a breakthrough in relations with North Korea. Japan
and North Korea have no formal ties.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Koichi Haraguchi said that following
Takeshita's statement, ``we hope for some response (from the North)
but have no expectations.''
   Asked if the statement was a prelude to full diplomatic
relations with the North, he replied: ``Many steps remain before we
go into that stage. ... We are sending a signal that we'd like to
have meaningful dialogue with North Korea.''
   Haraguchi said Japan made its position clear to North Korea on
several occasions in messages conveyed through third countries. He
would not elaborate.
   Takeshita said, ``On this occasion when the situation
surrounding the Korean peninsula is entering upon a new era, I
would like to express, toward all the people of the peninsula, our
deep remorse and regret for the unfortunate past.''
   ``The government and people of Japan are profoundly aware that
past actions by Japan have inflicted great suffering on the peoples
of nearby lands,'' he said, adding that Japan was determined ``that
it shall never happen again.''
   He said Japan ``hopes to improve relations with the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea on the basis of the above-mentioned
reflection, giving due consideration to the new situation on the
peninsula.''
   Kyodo News Service said it was the first time a Japanese prime
minister had used North Korea's official name.
   ``The government has made public since last year its hope to
enter into discussions, without any preconditions, with the ...
(North) on any aspect of pending issues,'' Takeshita said.
   Japan offered a similar apology when it normalized relations
with South Korea in 1965. After Japan's defeat, Korea was split
into capitalist, pro-Western South and Communist North.
   The 1950-53 Korean War deepened enmity between the two Koreas,
but in recent months they have held contacts aimed at easing
tensions.
   Japan's efforts to improve relations with North Korea coincided
with South Korea's call for its allies and non-communist friends to
help create a climate favorable for efforts toward Korean
reunification.
   Seoul has adopted a new ``northern policy,'' seeking trade and
diplomatic ties with Communist countries.
   So far, the Japan-North Korea Parliamentarians Friendship League
and the Socialist Party have been Japan's main bridges to North
Korea.
   North Korea's Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Jan. 20
accusing Japan of a hostile attitude toward Pyongyang and demanding
an apology for ``past crimes.'' It said Japan supported
perpetuation of Korea's division in a ``two-Korea policy.''
   Japan's Foreign Ministry said in a policy statement: ``Japan has
no intention of supporting the perpetuation of division desired by
neither North nor South.''
   Ministry officials have said that in moving toward improved
ties, the government also hoped for the speedy release of two
Japanese seamen sentenced in December 1987 to 15 years in prison
for alleged spying against North Korea.

   A Frenchman's exhausting effort to beat a
month-old New York-to-San Francisco sailing speed record fell just
a few agonizing hours short on Thursday after an 81-day,
14,500-mile journey.
   A tired and bloody Philippe Monnet steered his battered trimaran
under the Golden Gate, three days after he threw his food overboard
to lighten his boat's load and squeeze out another knot or two. He
had gone four days without sleep.
   Monnet, 29, lost his bid for the record after a series of
heart-breaking setbacks, including a brush with a submerged iceberg
off Cape Horn that cost him a week for repairs and a tussle with
18-foot seas and capricious winds off the California coast.
   But Monnet became the first sailor to make the voyage alone and
appeared jubilant as he bounded out of the cabin of the 60-foot
Elle et Vire, arms raised to greet a crowd of well-wishers at Pier
39.
   Leaping onto the deck as the boat was tied up, he received a
kiss from his girlfriend and popped the cork of a bottle of French
champagne.
   Later, on the dock, he said simply: ``I am very tired but I am
here in San Francisco, my boat is here, and it is good. No?''
   Asked if he would like to get away from his boat, the
indefatigable sailor looked puzzled, shrugged and said: ``I like
sailing.''
   Monnet needed to arrive at the Golden Gate by 7:34 a.m. to snap
the mark set Feb. 12 by the American sloop Thursday's Child, which
took 80 days and 20 hours port to port to break a 135-year-old
record.
   In addition to his collision with an iceberg, Monnet slashed his
hands and arms on Monday after the main wire supporting his mast
snapped off the coast of Southern California. Monnet had to climb
the mast and spent hours cutting the tangled sail away and
repairing the vital cable.
   Michael Fortenbaugh, representing the Manhatten Yacht Club,
which put up the Clipper Challenge Cup trophy for the record
attempt, said that missing the record doesn't diminish Monnet's
acheivement.
   ``It's sad and all (that he missed the record), but he is the
first person to do it singlehanded,'' Fortenbaugh said. ``His
acheivement is not dimmed one bit.''
   Plans call for Monnet to catch the first available plane to New
York and then to Paris, Fortenbaugh said. The ship will remain
behind, on view at touristy Pier 39.
   ``I don't know what the French will do with it after that,'' he
said.
   Somewhere to the south is another trimaran that had been trying
for the record, the 50-foot Finistere Bretagne, skippered by Anne
Liardet.
   With fiance Joseph Le Guen as crew, she started Jan. 1 from New
York but was overtaken by Monnet. Liardet was the first woman to
attempt the New York-San Francisco challenge.
   Thursday's Child, crewed by skipper Warren Luhrs, 44, Alachua,
Fla., Courtney Hazleton, 32, Palmetto, Fla., and Lars Bergstrom,
54, Sarasota, Fla., broke a record set by the clipper ship Flying
Cloud in 1854.

<HEAD>Carl Reiner's Had a Dream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl Reiner's long career in show business has
been a succession of possible dreams, from ``Your Show of Shows,''
to the ``Dick Van Dyke Show'' and ``The 2,000-Year-Old Man.''
   The dream began in the mid-1940s when he saw Sid Caesar in the
musical, ``Tars and Spars,'' and Reiner vowed to work with him some
day. He would eventually become a key writer and performer on
Caesar's ``Your Show of Shows,'' the classic '50s TV comedy-variety
program with Imogene Coca, and went on to create the ``Dick Van
Dyke Show'' in the '60s.
   He also starred in the hit film ``The Russians Are Coming, The
Russians Are Coming,'' and directed ``Where's Poppa'' and ``All of
Me'' among other movies. His son, Rob, starred in the landmark
television sitcom, ``All in the Family,'' and is now a director in
his own right.
   But the 67-year-old Reiner hasn't lost his touch. Two years ago
he went to see ``Me and My Girl'' and was overwhelmed by the show's
star, Robert Lindsay.
   ``I said to my wife afterwards, `Not since Dick Van Dyke have I
seen a guy that intriguing.' He combined everything. He's a great
actor. He learned to dance for `Me and My Girl.' He had never
danced professionaly.''
   To Reiner's delight, Lindsay was open to working with him and
stars in ``Bert Rigby, You're a Fool,'' a musical-comedy that
features the Tony Award winner's acting and dancing talents.
   ``When you see talent like Lindsay's, you have to get him in
front of the public,'' said Reiner, who wrote and directed the
film. ``He's well known only in the theatrical circles, so we have
to tell the world there's a new star on the horizon.''
   Helping others has been a trademark of Reiner since joining
``Your Show of Shows'' in 1950 and working with a high-powered
writing team that included Mel Brooks and Neil Simon.
   ``We were all screaming towards the center, trying to get our
jokes heard,'' Reiner recalled. ``Neil Simon had a soft voice so I
always spoke up for Neil.''
   He also played straight man to Brooks in the comedy sketch,
``The 2,000 Year-Old Man,'' helping to launch the career of the
director of such outrageous hits as ``The Producers'' and ``Young
Frankenstein.''
   ``It's totally ad-libbed. I came into the office one day and
heard something that bothered me on television, somebody who
actually said they saw something that they couldn't have seen.
   ``I turned and said to Mel, `So you were actually at the scene
of the crucifixion,' and Mel said, (with a heavy accent) `Oh boy,
vat a day,' and for the rest of the day I interviewed him.''
   Reiner and Brooks performed the routine at private parties for
several years until Steve Allen suggested they make a recording.
``2,000 Years With Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks'' was released in
1960 and was so popular that the pair recorded a number of sequels.
By 1965, Reiner and Brooks had sold over 2 million records.
   ``Steve Allen said, `Why don't you put on tape,''' Reiner
recalled. ``I said, `This is nothing, this is for friends. But we
went ahead and did a two-hour tape, which was cut down to 47
minutes. The rest is history.''
   Reiner stuck with Caesar through various incarnations of ``Your
Show of Shows,'' before taking a shot at a solo career in the late
'50s. He had an idea about starring himself in a situation comedy
about a television writer for the ``Alan Brady Show,'' a variety
program starring a talented but volatile man, a ``benevolent
dictator.''
   But Reiner realized he wasn't good enough to do it himself, so
he turned to a unknown actor called Dick Van Dyke.
   ``Dick Van Dyke is one of the rare talents,'' said Reiner, who
wrote 40 of the first 60 episodes himself. ``He was what I call
left-right coordinated. He can do anything, anything he's asked to
do and he can do it very easily.''
   Rob Reiner, then a teen-ager, and his friend, Albert Brooks, who
became an actor and director as well, were frequent visitors on the
``Dick Van Dyke'' set.
   ``Rob is one of the spongelike people,'' his father noted. ``He
absorbs everything. He learns by being around, I never gave him
instruction.''
   And Reiner had no objections to his child entering show business.
   ``Why would you warn somebody against the best job in the world?
... When you're at work you're with people who are making fun,
especially with comedy.
   ``Even in drama you're with very nourishing people. Some of them
are tough to be with but they're always interesting. It's a
wonderful life.''

<HEAD>Hey, Hey He Was a Monkee....</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ski cap from his days in the Monkees is
gone. The hair is tinged with gray, and when Michael Nesmith
speaks, a soft Southern accent can be detected.
   But in his own quiet way, Nesmith remains a force in the
entertainment industry. Since leaving the Monkees, he has released
a series of critically acclaimed country-rock albums, developed the
idea for a music video television station that would lead to the
creation of MTV, and served as producer of the cult movies ``Repo
Man,'' ``Square Dance'' and the recently released ``Tapeheads.''
   ``You can bounce around my career, I'll tell you,'' Nesmith said
in a recent interview.
   ``Tapeheads'' stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins as a pair of
ambitious video producers called the Video Aces who eventually
strike it rich through a series of bizarre incidents, including the
death by explosion of a heavy metal singer.
   Singers Sam Moore of the 1960s soul group Sam and Dave, and
Junior Walker, a star for Motown around the same time, play a
rhythm 'n' blues duo called The Swanky Modes, whom Cusack and
Robbins are anxious to promote.
   ``I thought, `Boy, if we could get a really good R&amp;B duo to play
the Swanky Modes and a really good group to play the Video Aces,
this could be a movie I'd want to see,''' Nesmith said. ``It was
really the music that was most attractive to me.''
   The film pokes fun at the music video industry, with its
ever-changing fashions and glitzy imagery, and even features a
cameo by ex-MTV ``veejay'' Martha Quinn. Nesmith had hoped that MTV
would participate in making the film, but the music channel was not
amused.
   ``We thought we'd tie in with them, but MTV didn't want to have
anything to do with it,'' Nesmith said. ``We thought they'd enjoy
being part of it. It made fun of them, so they said, `No.' I don't
think we did anything disrespectful to MTV, it was just a funny
little poke, a way of saying, `Come on, don't take yourself so
seriously.'''
   Nesmith, a native of San Antonio, Texas, first became famous in
the '60s as the ``serious'' member of the Monkees, the made-for
television soft-rock group that had a string of hit records
including ``Daydream Believer'' and ``Last Train to Clarksville.''
The Monkees, whose fun-loving image was closely modeled after the
Beatles, did not play on their early records or write their own
material.
   But Nesmith considered himself a musician rather than a pop
star. Before joining the Monkees, he had played at the Troubador
Club in Los Angeles, an early venue for such stars as Neil Young,
Stephen Stills and Linda Ronstadt, who had a hit with the Nesmith
composition, ``Different Drum.''
   ``I was the master of ceremonies and every Monday night was sort
of talent night,'' he said. ``Because it was a folky kind of club,
there were acoustic instruments and everybody sang. It consisted of
pretty much the locals and out-of-work musicians and people who
didn't have a chance to play anyplace else.''
   Nesmith would eventually take advantage of the Monkees'
popularity to get wider exposure for his own writing.
   ``It took me a long time to think of the Monkees as a way of
expressing myself musically,'' Nesmith said.
   By 1970, the Monkees had broken up and Nesmith was surprising
critics with his own imaginative blend of country and rock. In
1976, Island Records asked him for a video to go along with one of
his songs, ``Rio,'' telling Nesmith that the clip would help sales
in Europe. Island expected Nesmith to simply record himself singing
the song, but the artist decided to try something different,
producing a ``concept video'' instead.
   ``They had 30-odd promotional people around the country and when
the other clips started playing through, I became nervous because
they were all just performance clips,'' Nesmith recalled. ``But
when it was over, they all stood up and cheered my video. From
there, the idea kind of emerged that this is an art form.''
   He quickly built on the concept of a music video channel,
putting together a half-hour program called ``Popclips.'' Nesmith
eventually sold the idea to Warner Amex and in the early 1980s,
Music Television was conceived.
   ``The needle just went off the meter for `Popclips,''' Nesmith
said. ``MTV wanted me to program the station, but at that point, I
made the decision to just stay involved on the creative end.''
   He is now concentrating more on film production, operating his
own Pacific Arts Video company, which encompasses home video
distribution, film production and the creation of future home video
programming formats. Nesmith also is a major supporter of the
American Film Institute.
   ``I still don't have much of an idea of what video means
socially. I come to it as an artist. I don't think video, I sort of
think about video.''

<HEAD>`Hillside Stranglers' Rises Above Exploitation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC may have developed a reputation for
sensationalism thanks to the Geraldo Rivera special and some racy
made-for-TV movies, but ``The Case of the Hillside Stranglers,''
about the real-life murders of 10 young women, avoids exploitation
in favor of crack storytelling.
   The movie, airing Sunday, benefits from superb performances all
around, especially Richard Crenna as real-life homicide detective
Bob Grogan.
   Steven Gethers, who directed the movie and wrote the script,
based on the Darcy O'Brien book ``Two of a Kind: The Hillside
Strangers,'' gives his actors gritty dialogue and realistic scenes.
What more do we need to know about Grogan when he gets out of bed
and goes to the refrigerator to find nothing but a solitary pickle
floating in a jar?
   Dennis Farina, a former real-life cop and good-guy star of
``Crime Story,'' is evil incarnate as Angelo Buono, the upholsterer
who with his cousin Kenneth Bianchi was eventually convicted of
murder. Billy Zane as Bianchi seems at the beginning of the movie
almost too much the charming pretty boy, but by the end of it his
character has become a malevolent manipulator.
   Gethers effectively follows both the cops and the killers
through the events of 1977-79. The heart of the story belongs to
Grogan, a tough-talking cop obsessed with his job to the detriment
of his marriage. When he comes in to the office before dawn, the
first thing he does is pour himself a stiff drink and complain to a
colleague (James Tolkan) that his estranged wife is demanding he
lead ``a normal life _ and wear pajamas.'' Karen Austin plays J.D.
Jackson, the would-be witness who becomes Grogan's understanding
girlfriend, and so caught up in the case she even poses as a
customer to get a load of Buono.
   The movie opens with the handsome Bianchi gaining entrance to a
woman's apartment by flashing a ``police reserve'' badge and
telling her that her car has been damaged in the parking lot. Her
body is found dumped on a hillside, hence the name of the crime
wave that shocked and fascinated Los Angeles, as well as rest of
the country in late 1977 and early 1978.
   Grogan immediately makes two accurate assumptions _ that there
are two men involved and that they are raping, torturing and
murdering women for fun.
   The psychopaths Bianchi and Buono are outwardly normal guys. At
one point, Buono shows his cousin his collection of rare fish and
recalls how he and his third wife awakened their 6-year-old
daughter to watch one of the fish give birth to live offspring.
``They shoot 'em out like a rocket,'' he says admiringly, adding,
``It was great sex education for the kid.'' Bianchi tells him he's
a great father.
   For Buono, there was a psychological reward in not getting
caught. But Buono's downfall eventually was his cousin's need for
celebrity.
   Buono and Bianchi would pose as police officers while driving in
their car at night, pull over an unsuspecting woman driver, then
abduct her and take her back to Buono's suburban home. The bodies
were disposed of on the wooded hillside not far away.
   The movie portrays abduction scenes, but only conveys the
horrific nature of the crimes through brief scenes showing marks of
torture on the bodies. There is one scene, though, when Buono, with
a bound and struggling young woman in his arms, turns to Bianchi
before slamming the door and says in a monotone, ``Me first.''
   It appears that the stranglers might have gotten away with the
crimes, except that Bianchi, exiled to Bellingham, Wash., by his
cousin for being too careless, messily murdered two young women
there. After his arrest, Bianchi tries to fake insanity, but the
L.A. cops get a psychiatrist to declare him a fake.
   There's a somewhat abrupt transition to the middle of the trial,
but a nicely played scene has Grogan showing the jury, in the dark
of night, the hillside locations where the bodies were found.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager's Death Changes City's Outlook On Alcohol</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to clarify that death was after car crash,
sted immediate.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BENKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Jennifer Fleming died after a car
crash early on New Year's Day 1988, it changed the way Los Alamos
looked at alcohol.
   ``It's totally just not cool to drink and drive anymore,'' said
Los Alamos County youth coordinator Peggy Vigil. Students ``see
those who drink and drive as the enemy. They saw public outrage,
perhaps you could say community anger.''
   Jennifer, 16, a Los Alamos High School junior, was fatally
injured while driving around to help sober up a friend who'd been
drinking. Jennifer had spent the evening at an alcohol-free dance
she'd helped organize.
   ``I didn't want to go home at the time because I was afraid my
parents would find out,'' said Laura Root, who was with Jennifer's
and two friends when a pickup swerved to avoid a stopped car and
crushed Jennifer's car.
   ``Before the accident, I was on a crash course,'' Laura said.
``I was doing things. I was lying to my parents. I was totally out
of control. I guess for me it took one of my best friends dying to
realize I couldn't live that way any more. It wasn't worth it. It
just wasn't worth it.''
   She lost 12 teeth, suffered a bruised spinal cord and a crushed
knee that had metal from the wreckage embedded in it. ``They're
still reconstructing my mouth. Sometime this summer they should be
done.''
   Jeff Bussolini permanently lost all but peripheral vision in his
left eye and suffered a fractured hip, arm and 20 to 30 fractures
in his face.
   Stephanie Van Dyck had fractures of the foot, arm, ribs, hand
and face and a punctured lung. She still feels pain more than a
year later.
   After they got out of the hospital, Jeff, Stephanie and Laura
helped found a chapter of Students Against Driving Drunk. The
20-member chapter held an alcohol-free St. Patrick's Day dance this
year.
   Ms. Vigil said she has seen a change in ``how the kids perceive
and treat their peers who drink and drive.'' There has been a 42
percent decrease in arrests for driving while intoxicated since
1986, she said.
   The biggest decline came after the crash, said Police Chief Alan
Kirk. ``The last year in Los Alamos there's been a tremendous
publicity campaign by various organizations in the community to
bring attention to the drunk driving problem. The County Council
passed several laws the past year which also deal with drunk
driving violations.''
   These include extending a ban on open beverage containers to the
passenger, not just the driver; a mandatory 30 days in jail for
third-time offenders; 15 days for driving on a DWI-revoked license;
and two days if breath alcohol is 0.15 percent or higher. The legal
limit for DWI remains 0.10.
   Police also have intensified roadblocks and have been speaking
at schools and civic organizations, Kirk said. Jennifer's death
``definitely impacted the community. It was tremendous just as far
as the publicity aspect.
   ``When you go to parties anymore, the discussion is: `We need to
be careful and not become intoxicated to drive home or there may be
a roadblock,' and I think that has caused people to drink less.''
   Certainly pickup driver Jack Kerns' views have changed. Kerns,
31, who admits he was drinking but denies he was drunk, was accused
of driving while intoxicated and without a license; it had been
revoked for DWI. He is serving 7{ years in Los Lunas Correctional
Facility for vehicular manslaughter.
   ``Nobody regrets what happened more than I do,'' Kerns said,
adding that when he gets out of prison he hopes to work in alcohol
counseling.
   ``From that night on, I have not had one thing to drink, one
alcoholic beverage of any kind,'' he said. ``I am totally against
alcohol, and I am angry that people treat it as a socially
acceptable beverage.''
   Jennifer's mother, Marion Fleming, who is in the process of
founding a chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers in Los Alamos,
issued a plea to people who think they are sufficiently in control
to drink and drive.
   ``If they had any idea what it's like to go through something
like this, they would never take the risk,'' she said. ``What
little enjoyment there can be can't possibly be worth the risk.
What Jack Kerns did to us was bad, but what he did to himself was
in many ways just as bad.''

<DATELINE>SURRIBAS, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People knew Paulino Fernandez as a
reserved, distant man obsessed with his plots of land in this
isolated mountain hamlet. But one day the 64-year-old farmer
unsheathed the knife he used to slaughter pigs and stabbed six
neighbors to death.
   Then he burned himself to death in his farmhouse.
   News of the killings March 7 caught the attention of all Spain:
it had happened in Galicia, a long-ignored, underdeveloped,
northwestern region where only 27 percent of the population lives
in cities.
   ``It appears clearly to have been an attack of madness,'' said
historian Ramon Villares Paz. ``Yet it's a paradigmatic incident, a
sort of death cry of a rural society of elderly people with a
tightly held conviction that their culture has no future.
   ``Surribas is isolated, like a majority of villages in Galicia,
populated mainly by old people, with problems of communication
between them, without any future, without horizons.''
   Galicia is sometimes called Spain's Ireland because of its
Celtic origins. The playing of bagpipes is common and every summer
an international Celtic music festival is held in Ortigueira,
attracting musicians from all the Celtic regions of Europe. The
Celtic cross is a familiar sight throughout Galicia and a dance
called the Muneira is similar to the Irish jig.
   Galicia is a four-province region of verdant, hilly land,
geographically cut off from the rest of the country by poor
communications and a rugged mountain range ringing its eastern
flank and its southern border with Portugal.
   Since pre-historic times, it has been characterized by a social
and economic structure not usual in the rest of Spain.
   Subsistence farming remains the norm in much of the interior of
Galicia today.
   And there lived Paulino Fernandez in his farmhouse with his
fears.
   ``Paulino had been extremely worried about someone taking his
land, but he faced no threat of any kind and had normal relations
with neighbors,'' said Sergio Vazquez Yebra, Fernandez's lawyer and
mayor of the nearby town of Chantada.
   The Galician village is ``a world subject to drastic
transformations,'' wrote columnist Carlos Luis Rodriguez in La Voz
de Galicia, the region's leading newspaper.
   ``The crime ... is in part an expression of the daily dramas of
rural Galicia that stun us because they shatter our ideal of the
bucolic village.
   ``The Galician village is a genuine pressure cooker where all
kinds of conflicts simmer over a low fire and where the modern and
the ancestral crash into each other as if upon a breakwater.
   ``The peasant who listens to the sermon of the parish priest in
the morning and watches `Dallas' on television by the light of the
hearth must necessarily suffer a shock due to the sudden clash
between a world view proper of the last century with another that
is an advance of that to come in the next century.'' Between 1950
and 1970, the region of 3 million people underwent a rapid, but
incomplete industrialization, mainly involving shipbuilding and
steel plants on the Atlantic coast.
   But more than 20,000 relatively recent, high-paying jobs were
lost in these smokestack industries through drastic restructuring
forced by Spain's decade-long economic recession that ended in 1984.
   Galicia contributes less than 6 percent to Spain's gross
national product, and agriculture still dominates the economy.
   Potatoes, corn, grapes and cabbage are the principal crops, and
the dairy industry provides 25 percent of the milk for Spain's 39
million people.
   Paulino Fernandez's obsession with his land rang true to the
Galicians' fabled ties to the earth and their legendary longing for
it after they had emigrated to Latin America or more recently to
West Germany or France.
   An estimated 1 million Galicians haunted by the specter of a
dark future left in this century.
   Among the best-known products of Galicia are Cuba's Fidel Castro
and Raul Alfonsin, the president of Argentina.
   Other Spaniards see Galicians (or Gallegos) as melancholy,
broodingly pessimistic people, obsessed with death and witchcraft.
   They are also known for their cunning and their contradictory
nature.
   ``If you see a Gallego on a staircase,'' a popular saying goes,
``you can never tell if he's going up or coming down.''
   ``While Galicians sometimes exaggerate their love for their
homeland, in many cases when they move to other parts of the
country, they identify themselves more with Spain than with Galicia
and have a love-hate relationship with their birthplace,'' said
Mayuor Vazquez Yebra.
   The historian Villares Paz said Paulino Fernandez's violent
attack on his unsuspecting neighbors was ``more than homicide: an
incident that suggests a kind of attempt at collective
self-punishment _ `We have no exit, where can we go? We have no
future.'''

   If not for the efforts 50 years ago of
Frank W. Cyr, the ubiquitious yellow school bus might be a bus of a
different color.
   Green, white, bright red, just about every color showed up on
the vehicles that carried kids to class back in 1939. Some
districts painted theirs yellow, as safety experts had begun to
urge. But others had the idea that red-white-and-blue buses would
make children more patriotic.
   Chaos reigned _ and it didn't end with color.
   In Kansas, children traveled to school in wooden wheat wagons.
In many rural states, it wasn't unusual for youngsters to ride in
trucks with floorboards covered with cow flop.
   To survey this school transportation mess, Cyr, then a rural
education expert at Columbia Teachers College in New York, toured
10 states with the help of a Rockefeller Foundation grant.
   Returning, he gathered educators, school bus manufacturers and
paint experts for a landmark meeting that produced a 42-page
pamphlet containing the nation's first school bus safety standards
_ from axles to brakes to color.
   On April 26, half a century after the gathering, Teachers
College plans a luncheon in honor of Cyr, now 88 and the
acknowledged ``father of the yellow school bus.''
   ``School bus yellow'' is now as natural to America's morning
landscape as the sunrise. More than 22 million public
schoolchildren ride in 361,998 buses each day, says Larry McEntire,
president of the National Association of State Directors for Pupil
Transportation Services.
   The formula for the orange-yellow paint used on virtually all of
them is on file at the National Bureau of Standards.
   ``It is hard to imagine today any area of education policy where
you could gather people in one room and cause such a national
change to occur,'' said P. Michael Timpane, president of Teachers
College.
   The standards agreed upon at that meeting had impact far beyond
color.
   ``What the next 50 years revealed is that this simple
instrument, the school bus, can be a powerful instrument in
education policy,'' said Timpane.
   If not for national standards that put safe buses in each
district, the school consolidation movement would have stalled.
There were 80,000 school districts in the 1930s. Today, there are
just 16,000.
   Later, buses became both the symbol and engine of racial
integration.
   Within a few years of the conference, about 35 states adopted
bus standards. The last state, Minnesota, switched from ``Minnesota
Golden Orange'' to yellow in 1974.
   But safety was by no means the sole reason for standardizing
school bus color, Cyr told a visitor to his white clapboard
Victorian home in the tranquility of this northern Catskills hamlet.
   Economics and bureaucratic chaos were at least as important in
causing the clamor for standards during the 1930s, he said.
   ``Terrible'' is how he described the student transportation
situation.
   Cyr, who had grown up in a sod house in the Republican River
Valley of Nebraska and had taught in country schools, was by then a
noted authority on rural education. It was his idea in the 1930s to
form school cooperatives to help rural districts provide student
services they couldn't afford on their own.
   The Rockefeller Foundation invited him to study the shortcomings
of rural school transportation.
   He drove through 10 states.
   ``The local districts all told me they were in trouble. They all
said state officials had standards for manufacturing vehicles and
kept changing them.
   ``The state departments were even more unhappy. They lacked
expertise. They didn't know how to establish standards.
   ``I visited bus companies and they were having more trouble than
anyone,'' Cyr continued. They had to cope with the differing rules,
requirements and tastes from 48 states.
   ``For every different color, the bus companies had to have
different booths to spray paint them.''
   Even before the conference, some school districts were using
yellow buses because the color was known to be highly visible in
rain and fog, Cyr said.
   ``But a number of states wired us to ask if they should go
red-white-and-blue. I said, please don't do anything until we've
had our meeting.''
   Cyr chuckled as he thought back. ``Red-white-and-blue was
camouflage, if you think about it. It was to make kids patriotic.
It was well-meaning, but they made the buses less visible. And I
don't think it really had much affect on patriotism.''
   Armed with $5,000 in Rockefeller Foundation money, a small
fortune at the time, Cyr invited state education officials from
across the country, engineers from Chevrolet, International
Harvester, Dodge and Ford, and paint experts from DuPont and
Pittsburgh Paint to Teachers College to set bus safety standards.
   When talk turned to color, Cyr displayed 50 shades ranging from
lemon yellow to deep orange-red.
   There was no bitter debate, Cyr said. The group appointed a
committee of education officials, and they settled on the color
seen on buses ever since.
   Fifty years later, Cyr likes to tell the story of how his son,
Bill, once asked: ``If you're the `father of the yellow school
bus,' what does that make me?''
   ``I told him that anytime a school bus goes by, he can say,
`There goes one of my brothers.'''

<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's crime in the streets, rivers are polluted
and children are dropping out of school, the China Daily informs
its readers.
   ``Scholars foresee a national crisis,'' it headlines. ``Price
rises start panic buying,'' it warns. ``Officials' power abuse is
major concern,'' it says.
   For the foreign visitor expecting a tightly controlled good-news
press, China's only English-language daily is full of the
unexpected.
   But a crusading Communist daily? Hardly.
   Like the increasingly lively Chinese vernacular press from which
it takes most of its more eye-opening material, the China Daily
sticks to those social ills the government wants exposed.
   Criticism of senior leaders, questioning one-party rule or
delving into sensitive subjects such as unrest in Tibet are
strictly off limits.
   What the eight-page paper does offer, particularly for a
foreigner far from home, is up-to-date figures from world stock
markets, international news from the Western news agencies and a
wide-ranging sports page carrying the latest in American
basketball, European soccer or Asian table tennis.
   ``Our philosophy is to provide our readers with what is
happening in China and what is happening in the world,'' said
Deputy Chief Editor Chen Hui.
   Chinese press authorities began mulling the idea of an
English-language daily in 1979, the year China embarked on its
economic reforms and open-door policy. Before that, non-Chinese
speakers or readers lived in a news vacuum except for several dull,
propaganda-filled English-language periodicals.
   The China Daily, with technical assistance from the Australian
Thomson Foundation and the Melbourne Age, began publishing June 1,
1981, with a first edition of 10,000 copies.
   Within two years it had an air-mailed North American edition and
in 1987 began satellite transmissions to London for distribution in
Western Europe. Besides London, it now publishes in New York, San
Francisco, Hong Kong, Canton and Shanghai.
   Originally printed five days a week, the paper now comes out six
days and has a four-page business paper on Sunday. Chen said
domestic circulation has risen to about 130,000, with two-thirds of
the readership being Chinese.
   Chen said the daily, which delivers to major hotels for
foreigners, is China's first not to depend entirely on the plodding
post office for distribution. It is also the first, with about 25
percent of space devoted to ads, to obtain a large percent of its
revenues from advertisements.
   The paper also is financed by sales _ it costs only 30 fen (8
cents) a copy _ and, like all Chinese papers, government subsidies.
   Chen insists, though, that government backing does not make the
China Daily ``official.'' Papers like the Communist Party's
People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) ``have the role of explaining
government and party policies to the people. That's not our
purpose. We can't get the foreigner to do anything.''
   The editorial board, which puts together a weekly commentary and
oversees daily articles, is not subject to outside influence, Chen
said.
   But like all Chinese media, the China Daily exercises
self-censorship and doesn't ``report for the sensationalism
involved to widen readership,'' Chen said.
   Asked why the paper carries reports of strikes in Poland but
little about strikes in China, he said, ``We must exercise a little
more care in considering the social consequences'' of events closer
to home.
   Charles Frankel, one of about 10 foreigners on one-year
contracts at the paper, said that on sensitive issues such as
anti-Chinese riots in Tibet or recent confrontations between
Chinese and African students who say they are victims of racial
prejudice, the paper's reporters make no effort to get the
``other'' side of the story.
   ``If they did, they didn't report it,'' said Frankel, who worked
28 years for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin and taught journalism at
Hawaii University before coming to China.
   Frankel noted that although China was one of the biggest victims
of Japanese aggression in World War II, the China Daily, again
following the government lead, has made no appraisals of the role
of the late Emperor Hirohito of Japan in the war.
   Chen acknowledged that statements by the Dalai Lama, the exiled
Tibetan religious leader, appear only as background in articles
where the Chinese side condemns his calls for Tibetan autonomy.
   ``It would be better to report the straight news first,'' he
said.
   Frankel's wife, Helga, who also works at the paper, said
reporters are shocked at the way Westerners find fault with their
governments.
   ``There's no bridging the gap that you (reporters) criticize
your leaders.''
   But Charles Frankel said the paper shouldn't merely be judged by
American standards.
   ``It serves its purpose. I'm glad this paper exists because it
does present a window on the world.''

<HEAD>Change of Guard at Nuclear Arms Plant Signals Start of New Era</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When workers at the Savannah River Plant
report for duty Monday they'll find a new name on the entrance sign
and a new logo on their coffee cups _ small symbols of broad change
at the nation's largest nuclear weapons plant.
   After 38 years of operating the sprawling weapons plant for the
Energy Department, chemical giant E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. is
giving way to Westinghouse Electric Co., leaving behind a backlog
of problems that some say jeopardize national security.
   The three active nuclear reactors at Savannah River Plant have
been shut down for nearly a year because of safety and structural
problems, and a series of mishaps in recent months has raised
doubts about whether improvements are likely anytime soon. The
reactors are the nation's only source of tritium, a highly
radioactive gas used at other government defense plants to make
nuclear warheads.
   The Pentagon has said that unless at least one of the reactors
is restarted by the end of this year it might have to deactivate
some warheads to preserve supplies.
   The Energy Department is beleaguered by safety and operational
problems throughout its nuclear weapons complex, which includes 16
major plants in 12 states. Savannah River has been the focus of
criticism because it forms the most vital link in the chain of
nuclear weapons development, production and testing.
   As a result, the department's massive effort to rejuvenate
Savannah River has become a testing ground for its controversial
plan to spend at least $81 billion over the next two decades to
modernize and clean up the weapons complex.
   Westinghouse has vowed to impose a stricter, more streamlined
brand of management and a new approach to ensuring reactor safety.
   Westinghouse officially took over as the Energy Department's
contractor on Saturday, although for most of the roughly 20,000
people who work at the site in western South Carolina, Monday will
provide the first taste of life with a new boss.
   Some of the immediate changes are symbolic, such as changing the
name to Savannah River Site to reflect the idea that its
laboratories and other support facilties are crucial to the safe
operation of its beleaguered nuclear reactors.
   Some outside experts question how effective Westinghouse's
changes will be, and even the company's top managers concede some
improvements may be slow in coming.
   ``We're going to have problems, believe me,'' said James Moore,
president of Westinghouse Savannah River Co., a unit of the
Pittsburgh-based parent company. ``I hope what people will find is
different is that when we have those problems there'll be ... a
different way of solving them.''
   John Ahearne, chairman of an Energy Department advisory group,
said in a recent interview that Westinghouse may find it difficult
to impose change throughout the huge workforce, since it has
brought in only a small number of its own managers. Westinghouse
has kept on more than 97 percent of the du Pont staff.
   Moore said he wanted a large share of the Du Pont people to stay
to provide continuity.
   Du Pont has defended its record at Savannah River, saying it
fulfilled its mission of helping build and maintain the nation's
nuclear arsenal. It has stressed that no one ever was injured as a
result of any accidents at the plant.
   Moore is reluctant to criticize Du Pont's performance, although
he suggested in an interview with The Associated Press that Du Pont
was out of its depth.
   ``Du Pont's a good company, but they're a chemical company,''
Moore said in his transition office a few miles from the plant.
``They're not a nuclear company, and they really don't have any way
... of getting any specific interaction with the commercial side of
the business. We've been steeped in it from Day One.''
   Westinghouse is the world's largest builder of commercial
nuclear power plants. It also is the Energy Department's contractor
at nuclear weapons plants in Washington state and Ohio.
   Taking over operation of the Savannah River Plant is a massive
undertaking for Westinghouse.
   Besides the plant's three active nuclear reactors _ code named
K, L, and P reactors _ two others are permanently shut down. The
site also includes a research laboratory, a chemical separations
plant that makes weapon-grade plutonium, a facility that fabricates
fuel for the Navy's nuclear fleet and a plant that makes fuel to
run the on-site nuclear reactors. A building that prepares
high-level nuclear waste for permanent disposal is due to open
later this year.
   The emphasis on safety and secrecy at Savannah River is obvious
from a tour of the 300-square-mile site.
   Armed guards in combat fatigues patrol the area, which is closed
to the public. Slogans are posted on large signposts near buildings
and among the ramrod-straight Loblolly pines that cover much of the
site. ``Mum's the word,'' says one. Others say, ``Security protects
your jobs,'' and ``Take safety home.''
   Moore and other officials interviewed at Savannah River said
recent national publicity about the reactor problems has unfairly
cast the plant's workers in a bad light.
   ``They've really been dumped on,'' said Moore. He praised the
workers' dedication and said the main problem has been inadequate
training for reactor operators, whose decisions in the event of a
reactor mishap are critical to avoiding a catastrophy.
   ``We're not going to make nuclear physicists out of all the
operators, but we're going to give them a better understanding of
what's behind some of the procedures,'' Moore said.
   Andrew Cwalina, a member of the management team preparing for
restart of the K reactor and a 15-year Savannah River Plant
veteran, said most workers are receptive to Westinghouse's ideas
for change.
   Some view it as ``a matter of survival,'' he said.
   The Energy Department, too, is changing its ways. It has decided
that the amount of money to be paid to Westinghouse under its
five-year contract will depend on how well it performs. In the
first six months of the contract, Westinghouse could earn a maximum
of $7.5 million _ or it could get nothing _ said Mark Silverman, a
department official at Savannah River who helped write the award
fee plan.
   Du Pont, at its own insistence, received no fees for operating
the plant, although all its expenses were covered by the
government, as is the case with Westinghouse.
   ``One could argue there was relatively little incentive for (Du
Pont) even to do all that DOE asked of them,'' said Silverman, let
alone strive for improvement.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. says that when it
bid last year to take over operation of the Savannah River Plant it
was not aware that the nuclear reactors would have to be shut down
because of safety and structural problems.
   But the company insists its decision to take the job will prove
to have been sound.
   James Moore, president of a Westinghouse unit that will run the
federal weapons plant, said money was not a motivation for seeking
the assignment, which will pay a maximum of $7.5 million over the
first six months _ or zero, if the Energy Department determines
that plant performance is too far below minimum standards.
   Moore, in an interview, cited three key reasons for assuming
responsibility at one of 16 major nuclear weapons plants, a complex
that a government auditing agency called ``one of the more
potentially dangerous industrial operations in the world.''
   _It offers the possibility of blunting the spread of bad
publicity about nuclear power to the commercial nuclear field,
which is Westinghouse's main business.
   ``There was an element of defensiveness, I guess, to try to get
involved to see if we could bring our capabilities and experience
to move forward here and get more positive publicity,'' Moore said.
   _The company's nuclear specialists can remain ``involved and
motivated'' in their field at a time when new activity in the
commercial nuclear sector is at a standstill.
   _Savannah River's other facilities, including its research
laboratory and new plant for processing high-level radioactive
waste, can put Westinghouse at the cutting edge of nuclear
technology.

   So far this year, four people have been killed
in the streets of Washington every three days. That's the rate of
one every 18 hours.
   The city has been dubbed the murder capital, surpassing
Detroit's per-capita murder rate.
   As of midday Wednesday, the police say 123 murders have
occurred, compared to 78 at this time last year, 372 for all of
last year. The previous record for Washington was 287, set in 1969.
   In almost every case, the victim is a black male, and he meets
his demise in one of the city's poorest neighborhoods, according to
a report by Washington's Office of Criminal Justice Plans and
Analysis.
   Four out of five times, the report says, the slaying is
drug-related _ a prospective drug seller trying to encroach onto
another dealer's turf, a drug courier trying to keep more than his
share of the profits, or a user who didn't come up with the $10 or
$20 he owed his dealer.
   The murders start to look alike _ a black man between the ages
of 18 and 32 ends up lying in the street, shot in the head or
peppered with gunshot wounds from an automatic or semi-automatic
weapon.
   The slums have become a battleground for rival crack dealers
trying to gain a foothold on the market, the police say. Crack, a
cocaine derivative, which arrived in the city two or three years
ago, gives an intense high for a very short time. The cravings that
follow drive people to violence more than most other drugs, they
say.
   Murder has become a way for dealers to settle disagreements and
keep others in line, the police add.
   ``Homicide is highest in communities that have the greatest
inequalities, extreme differences in income and wealth,'' said
criminologist Lawrence Sherman, president of the Crime Control
Institute. ``And that is certainly the case in Washington compared
to other cities.''
   The district is 67 percent black, 28 percent white and 5 percent
other races. The black migration intensified after 1950, when job
opportunities lured blacks from the South, according to Gan Ahuja,
a demographer with the city's Office of Policy.
   A high birth rate among black women, coupled with the declining
number of births to white women, produced more black offspring,
Ahuja said, and many whites moved to the suburbs to take advantage
of better housing and schools.
   The district has the second highest per capita income in the
nation, according to the 1980 census _ yet 14 percent of its
residents live in poverty. The youth unemployment rate was 30
percent higher than the national average. More than 28 percent of
adults over age 25 have a college education, but 16 percent never
finished elementary school, according to the census.

   With the military back in the barracks
practically everywhere in South America, civilian government and
democracy will be put to the test in six countries this year. The
outcomes could signal the continent's future course. This is
another in a series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on
the economic, social and political turbulence that has turned South
America into a continent in crisis.

   South America's social and political
fabric, loosely woven at the best of times, is fraying in these
most difficult times.
   From bloody protests in Venezuela to disruptive strikes in
Brazil to spreading guerrilla influence in Peru and Colombia, the
symptoms of widespread discontent are making themselves
dramatically evident in this year of crucial elections in a half
dozen countries. Wracked by crushing indebtedness and recession for
seven years, the continent that began the 1980s in the flush of a
democratic rennaissance is ending the decade weary and frustrated.
   Few foresee doom, but many warn of a deepening gloom that could
become politically explosive.
   ``The misery, the depressing conditions of life, the lack of
food, housing, health, training, education, and jobs create a
culture dish that can be exploited by `ultras' and extremists of
whatever tendency,'' Argentina's President Raul Alfonsin recently
warned in Buenos Aires.
   President Jose Sarney of Brazil sees extremists on the left
gaining ground.
   ``Democracy is losing ground in Latin America because the
solution it has presented do not attend national problems,'' he
said in an interview with The Associated Press in late March. ``We
offer pessimistic solutions, and the parties of the left optimistic
ones.''
   In 16 days in May, three countries _ Paraguay, Bolivia and
Argentina _ will elect new presidents. Three others _ Uruguay,
Brazil and Chile _ will do so by year's end.
   It should be a time of renewal and democratic reaffirmation, but
there's no sense of celebration. At best, there's a feeling of
having held off defeat.
   ``The democracies, one way or another, have managed to
survive,'' said Jose Joaquin Brunner, academic coordinator at the
Santiago-based Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, he said the simple
fact that elections were being held is a sign that all is not bad.
   ``It wasn't a given that the new democracies were going to
become strong quickly.''
   He added, however, that the combination of tender democratic
institutions and an economic crisis ``is a very explosive mixture.''
   Since 1978, a by-and-large moderate political leadership has
directed the transition from military dictatorship to democracy in
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. It has taken
the unpopular path of austerity, curbing imports and limiting
spending on public services, in wrestling with South America's
foreign debt of $277 billion.
   The social cost has been high. Public hospitals and schools are
understaffed and in disrepair, their paint peeling and their
equipment antiquated or simply broken down. Overworked
state-hospital doctors in Brazil make the equivalent of about $130
a month; in Peru about half that. University professors commonly
hold two or three jobs to make a subsistence wage in most
countries. High-paying employment is hard to find, and stories of
architects and physicists driving taxis now are common.
   Even in Venezuela, whose oil wealth kept it immune to the
economic ailments afflicting its neighbors, real wages are slumping
dramatically and there is a growing shortage of basic consumer
goods, with supermarket shelves empty for the first time in 30
years.
   It was an increase in bus fares and the prices of some basic
consumer needs that set thousands to rioting across Venezuela in
late February; by official count 276 people were killed and
thousands injured, but unofficial accounts put the death toll at
300 to 500.
   The political cost of the economic and social unrest in South
America overall is likely to be seen in the upcoming elections.
Incumbent leaders and their parties are behind in the polls in
several countries, including Argentina and Bolivia. Presidents
Sarney of Brazil and Alan Garcia of Peru are beseiged by critics.

   Some challengers are employing strains of populism or
nationalism reminiscent of the 1940s or 1950s. While disturbingly
familiar to some older South Americans, they may carry appeal to a
new generation only beginning to learn about democratic processes.
   In Brazil, about 65 million of the 90 million eligible voters
will be voting for president for the first time in their lives on
Nov. 15. The last direct election was in 1960; Sarney was picked by
an electoral college. In Argentina and Uruguay, many millions will
be voting for president for only the second time in their lives.
   While a half-year of campaigning remains, one of the major
contenders in Brazil is Gov. Leonel Brizola of Rio de Janeiro, a
classic Latin American populist who heads the Democratic Labor
Party. His European-style socialist party and the leftist Workers
Party scored important victories in municipal elections last
November. Another is the leftist Luis Lula da Silva of the Workers
Party.
   In Venezuela, where elections were held in December, the leftist
Movement To Socialism doubled its representation in Congress. It
appeared to gain more popular ground three weeks ago when it
denounced police repression after the price riots.
   But analysts don't foresee a continental resurgence of the
classic Marxist left, which is losing ground to more moderate,
European-style socialism in most countries.
   ``Now no leftist with any sense would declare that capitalism is
exhausted,'' Brunner said.
   In many countries, the right appears the more formidable of the
two extremes. Despite having surrendered power the right-wing
military is still considered to have a powerful influence in Brazil
and in Argentina, where barracks revolts have forced the government
to make political concessions.
   The Peronist Carlos Menem holds an advantage in Argentina's
pre-election polls with a strongly nationalist campaign message. A
right-wing former military dictator, Hugo Banzer, is the pollster's
favorite in Bolivia.
   Venezuela's New Generation Party became that country's first
rightist group with a significant congressional presence, right
behind the Movement to Socialism. Colombia is struggling with a
chilling surge in right-wing death squad death squad activity.
   Only in Peru are leftist guerrilla organizations making inroads.
The Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and the pro-Castro Tupac
Amaru are winning new recruits among the country's largely Indian
and impoverished masses.
   But they have not inspired revolution outside Peru's borders.
When an ill-organized group of leftists recently attacked an army
base outside Buenos Aires in Argentina, a nationwide wave of
condemnation followed.
   Nonetheless, most of the region's leaders say real political
stability can only be achieved by improved social conditions. They
say that can only come when the crushing burden of the foreign debt
is finally lifted.
   Many see U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's proposal for
debt relief and new credit as a possible solution. But they see it
through tired eyes, having witnessed the failure of previous
initiatives.
   ``There is more weariness,'' said Gert Rosenthal, president of
the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America. He said
Brady's plan needed to be laid out in more detail, with the
region's debtor countries participating, before announcing a light
at the end of the long, dark tunnel.

   Since a pair of young East Coast investors
launched a takeover bid for the holding company Interco, things
have changed in Hermann, Mo. The shoe plant, the biggest employer
in town and an Interco division, closed to make up some of the
millions spent fending off the financiers. Longtime plant workers
have gotten severance checks: $30 for each year worked. What they
haven't gotten is a satisfactory explanation of why an inconclusive
skirmish in the corporate takeover wars left so many casualties in
a little hardworking town.

   In her $5-an-hour workaday world, Linda
Eikel never cared much about Wall Street wheeler-dealers or
billion-dollar buyouts. Not until it hit home and tore apart her
life.
   Millions were spent on a bid to buy her company, millions to
successfully block it, and now that it's over, the shoe factory
worker has no job, no insurance and no security.
   ``I'm kind of bitter,'' she says. ``I think the big shots, the
ones real high up, do not realize we have to struggle to make a
living.''
   Eikel worked at the Florsheim shoe plant, the biggest employer
in this small town until it closed in February as part of a giant,
complicated plan that allowed the parent company, Interco Inc., to
fend off a $2.7 billion hostile takeover.
   The four-month fight by Interco is the kind of saga that's
become more common in the merger-mania '80s: a Fortune 500 company
facing two thirtysomething corporate raiders and duking it out in a
fight that leaves many outside the ring bloodied and dazed.
   It's also a story of how a hostile takeover bid can be a
moneymaker for those with the least stake in the company _
financiers and lawyers _ and a heartbreaker for those with the most
basic vested interest _ the loyal employees.
   Elwood `Woody' Wesselschmidt made shoes for nearly 30 years and
was manager of the 275-worker Florsheim plant in Hermann. ``The big
people _ all they decide is what they want to buy and sell,'' he
said. ``The little guys are the ones who lose their jobs.''
   The losers may be obvious, but the winners of this skirmish in
the takeover wars aren't that clear. Take Interco, for exmple.
   To reorganize and avoid a takeover by Cardinal Acquisition
Corp., controlled by Steven and Mitchell Rales, Interco estimates
it'll pay more than $65 million to banks, lawyers, advisers and
others.
   It also borrowed $1.9 billion and developed a restructuring plan
that involves cutting $75 million over the next year and selling
off all but four or five of about 20 major companies.
   One cost-cutting measure, estimated to save $2 million annually,
was closing the Hermann plant and a second Florsheim factory in
Paducah, Ky., which together employed 650 people. Their work will
be consolidated elsewhere.
   For those keeping score, it might seem as if it's Interco 1,
Raiders 0. Not so. The raiders appear to have made millions, and
while Interco executives kept their jobs, they will be running a
shrunken, debt-burdened company.
   ``They end up selling their crown jewels to cover their
expenses,'' said said Kathryn Rudie Harrigan, strategic management
professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business.
``They're not in better shape now.''
   Interco recently sold Londontown Corp., maker of London Fog
outerwear, as part of a plan to sell all its apparel and most of
its retail groups. The $3.34 billion corporation will keep its
footwear and most of its furniture divisions, although one of its
most prestigious names, furniture maker Ethan Allen, is for sale.
   The corporation's managers will have to make the remaining
companies ``sell better,'' said Budd Bugatch, research director at
the investment banking firm Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. ``They have a
real monkey on their back.''
   For Interco, with $1.15 billion in loans to pay back by May
1990, much remains uncertain. But one thing about its
``restructuring'' is for sure.
   The plant closing has hurt Hermann, a proud German town in
wine-making country where shoes have been made since the beginning
of the century.
   ``There's a lot of the German work ethic here,'' said Perry
Lovett, city administrator in this eastern Missouri town of 2,700.
``There are a lot of people who've never been out of work.''
   ``I haven't looked for a job in almost 30 years,'' Wesselschmidt
said. ``I've never written a resume in my life. Yes, it's scary.''
   Still, he's more disappointed than angry.
   ``You bust your buns to make (the shoes) look good,'' he said.
``Then something like this happens and you feel betrayed. ... We
did our best. Now our best isn't doing us any good.''
   Pam Terrill, the union president, is angry.
   ``They said quality was No. 1. The people took it seriously. And
they closed the plant anyhow,'' she said. ``I wish they'd go under,
personally. I've heard that from quite a few other people.''
   The Florsheim workers can't realistically expect to find new
jobs in their industry. In just the last decade, 317 U.S. shoe
plants have closed, according to Footwear Industries of America.
Imported shoes make up 81.6 percent of the market.
   Many now rely on unemployment compensation. Severance pay came
to $30 for each year on the job, with a 15-year minimum and 30-year
maximum.
   ``They've caused our life to be in a heck of a turmoil,'' said
Eikel. ``I think people are bitter toward Interco, not Florsheim. I
don't think the big guys from Interco are hurting. ... They got
themselves into this takeover.''
   Interco, through its public-relations firm, Fleishman-Hillard,
refused to discuss the attempted takeover or any plans, but some
analysts say Eikel's assessment isn't far off.
   ``This is a management that acquired some wonderful brand names
... and did nothing with them,'' said Juli Niemann, analyst with
Stifel Nicolaus Inc., an investment banking firm. ``The stock
languished for years. Call it lack of stellar management.''
   Bugatch concurred: ``They did not operate the business in a way
that maximized shareholder value.''
   The result: Interco was ripe for raiders to come in, carve up
the company and sell it.

   Enter the Rales brothers, two aggressive, savvy, Washington,
D.C., businessmen with interests in tools, consumer plastics and
tire-changing equipment who reportedly were attracted to the
furniture business.
   They made four bids, starting with $64 a share, ending with $74
a share.
   Interco, which rebuffed the bids as inadequate, countered with
its own restructuring and recapitalization plan it said was valued
at $76 a share _ counting cash and securities to be offered to
shareholders, plus the stock's residual value.
   The company also adopted a ``poison pill'' defense, designed to
make an unwelcome takeover prohibitively expensive. According to
government documents the Rales brothers filed, 23 Interco
executives were to receive golden parachutes totaling more than $16
million if control of the company changed.
   By November, the Rales brothers nonetheless controlled nearly 93
percent of the stock _ their original stake of 8.7 percent plus 84
percent tendered by shareholders.
   But they let their final offer lapse, believing the fight had
dragged on too long and that Interco's value was deteriorating,
said Neil Call, their spokesman. The brothers declined to be
interviewed.
   They didn't acquire Interco, but they didn't lose either.
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the Rales brothers sold their
stock for a gross profit of $59.7 million, and analysts estimate
the takeover bid cost about $10 million, figures Call doesn't
dispute.
   Among Interco's costs are $40.5 million in fees to four banks
that arranged the $1.9 billion in loans, up to $9 million to a
financial adviser and $15.5 million to lawyers, accountants,
printers and others.
   There are better uses for the money, Niemann said. ``I'd like to
see $65 million in capital spending. Instead it's for lawyers and
investment bankers to send their kids to college.''
   ``The middlemen always win,'' Professor Harrigan said.
``Regardless of whether they catch their prey or not, they get
paid.''
   Other winners include shareholders who bought and sold stock as
it rose from $42 a share in March to $68.50 in July.
   As for the shoe plant workers, ``They're going to grab their
boots and pull them up a little higher and grab their belts and
make them a little tighter and see that it works out,'' said Tom
Cabot, president of the Hermann Area Chamber of Commerce.
   A printing company has expressed interest in the old Florsheim
building, which the city of Hermann purchased.
   And Eikel has a wish for the corporation.
   ``I hope Interco gets their thing together and gets back on the
right road,'' she said, ``so they don't have to do this to any more
people.''

<HEAD>Park Overall Has Built Career on Playing Redneck Women</HEAD>

   Park Overall just about holds a copyright on
portrayals of ``trashy'' Southern women, but what you see isn't
necessarily what you get.
   On NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' starring Richard Mulligan as a recently
widowed Miami pediatrician and Kristy McNichol and Dinah Manoff as
his daughters, Overall plays LaVerne, the nurse with the sharp
tongue and the Southern twang.
   ``I spent four and a half years in New York and I didn't lose my
accent,'' the Tennessean said. ``It's been very good to me. I think
it's so sad so many Southerners don't let on they're Southerners.
This business is about types. I do trashy Southern real well. Maybe
later they'll let me do something else.
   ``I'm limited but it don't bother me none. I can do other
things. I went to New York because I was tired of Yankee girls
playing Southern girls. I'm most comfortable with an Appalachian
accent. I can do a Tidewater accent, but it's a little snooty,''
said Overall, whose unusual monicker is an old family name.
   Wearing skintight jeans, thigh-high boots and a motorcycle
shirt, she sat cross-legged on a couch in her dressing room during
a break in filming. ``These boots improved my social life,'' she
said. ``The crew got very feisty.''
   She also wears a timer device that tells her when she can have a
cigarette. She doesn't smoke on camera. ``They like LaVerne to be
real clean,'' she said.
   ``LaVerne's married to a baseball player. A bad baseball player,
which doesn't make her happy.''
   LaVerne has been criticized as a demeaning Southern stereotype
by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, creator of ``Designing Women,'' who
objects to such jokes as LaVerne's remark, ``What do I know about
opera? I come from Arkansas.''
   ``I can't say I don't like a line. I'll get fired,'' Overall
replies, but she adds, ``I won't do incest jokes or bestiality
jokes.''
   She was Rowena the prostitute in ``Biloxi Blues'' on Broadway
and in the movie. She was three different voices on ``Talk Radio.''
In ``Mississippi Burning'' she was ``the beauty parlor thing with
the kerchief on my neck and the beehive hairdo.''
   But don't believe the stereotype. True, until she was 27, she
lived in Greeneville, Tenn., about 90 miles northeast of
Chattanooga. However, her father was a federal magistrate and her
mother was an English professor who taught at the University of
Tennessee, Vanderbilt and Randolph-Macon. When her mother took a
sabbatical at Oxford University, Overall attended an English
boarding school. Later, back in Tennessee, she got her college
degree in teaching.
   In her first movie, ``Tainted,'' a low-budget feature made by
some people in Hendersonville, N.C., she played an evil crematorium
operator. ``I got $50 and thought it was the living end,'' she
said. She had acted in school plays all through high school and
college. ``I met my boyfriend doing that movie. He was an assistant
cameraman. We've been together since.'' She has never seen the
movie, however.
   ``My first real professional job in New York was playing Becky
Lou in `The Tooth of the Crime,''' she said. ``I played a rock moll
with a red wig made for me by Paul Huntley. He gave me the wig, and
I wore it to auditions. It's my lucky wig. I still have that wig,
you betcha. It got me `Biloxi Blues.' That wig is to die for, it's
so gorgeous.''
   ``I wanted to wear the wig for LaVerne and make her a nurse in
the fast lane. But they didn't want any nonsense. She's very
wholesome. She has a dry wit, and I think that's turned out to be
right. She's got Southern wit and wisdom. Everything's black or
white, and that's how she gets through the day.''
   Overall kidded that she had to move to New York to see the
South. She was cast there for ``Talk Radio,'' which was filmed in
Dallas, ``Biloxi Blues,'' filmed in Fort Smith, Ark., and
``Mississippi Burning,'' filmed in Georgia and Alabama.
   ``I was just learning to be rude in New York,'' she said. ``Then
I moved to Los Angeles and had to be sweet again.''

   Junk bond king Michael R. Milken and two others
were indicted in an unprecedented racketeering and securities fraud
case, facing enormous prison terms and maximum penalties exceeding
$11 billion.
   The 98-count grand jury indictment Wednesday against the Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. financier, his brother Lowell and former
Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg was the most sensational event yet
from the explosive Ivan Boesky insider trading investigation that
has rocked Wall Street for more than two years.
   The scandal already has resulted in more than a dozen serious
cases and an agreement to plead guilty to fraud charges by Drexel,
the nation's fifth-largest securities firm.

   The sprawling indictment of junk bond wizard
Michael R. Milken should speed settlement of fraud charges against
his former bosses while provoking an intense legal battle over the
use of racketeering laws, defense lawyers say.
   The Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier _ the crown jewel in a
two-year investigation of the Wall Street investment firm _ was
charged Wednesday along with his brother and an associate, who face
mammoth prison terms and up to $11 billion in penalties.
   Defense lawyers attacked the 98-count indictment on racketeering
and securities fraud charges as an abuse of prosecutorial power, a
rehash of old allegations and a tool to wrench cooperation from
other Drexel employees.
   They also called the charges a ``perversion'' of the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, which was
established in 1970 principally to combat organized crime but is
used increasingly to prosecute white-collar criminals.
   ``I think it is outrageous to use RICO in a circumstance like
this,'' said Michael Armstrong, an attorney for Lowell Milken.
``They applied the statute to behavior which for the most part has
not been considered even to be criminal, much less the subject of a
racketeering indictment.''
   While certain to be hotly contested, the charges against Milken,
42, who almost single-handedly created the $175 billion high-yield
junk bond industry, are expected to help resolve separate civil and
criminal charges against Drexel.
   Negotiations between Drexel and the Securities and Exchange
Commission to settle civil fraud charges, including insider
trading, deadlocked earlier this month when the firm balked at a
provision to fire Milken before resolving the claims.
   With the indictment, Drexel placed Milken on leave from the
firm, clearing one roadblock. Once the SEC settlement on the civil
charges is signed, Drexel is to plead guilty to six felonies and
pay $650 million to settle criminal fraud charges brought by the
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.
   At issue in all the investigations, accusations and negotiations
is the use of federal racketeering statutes and government power to
obtain cooperation from defendants in cases linked to the
confessions of jailed insider trader Ivan Boesky.
   Drexel has said publicly it agreed to settle with the government
last December to avoid a racketeering indictment that could have
frozen its multibillion-dollar assets and crippled its operations.
   As part of the pact, the nation's fifth-largest brokerage house
agreed to fire Milken and withhold his 1988 pay, estimated at $100
million to $200 million. In the SEC deal, the government reportedly
wants to bar Milken from the firm for life and prohibit Drexel
employees from talking business with him.
   The wide-ranging charges in the 110-page indictment of the
Milkens and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg parallel last
September's SEC complaint and the government's racketeering
indictment of Princeton-Newport LP, a defunct investment
partnership, a month earlier. Newberg also was charged in that
case, set for trial June 5.
   Drexel allegedly illegally concealed the ownership of blocks of
stock for Princeton-Newport in a deal engineered by Milken.
   In its lengthy probe of Drexel that began when Boesky squealed
in late 1986, the government has achieved but one criminal
conviction: Lisa Jones, a 26-year-old bond trader's helper found
guilty last week of lying to a grand jury in the Princeton-Newport
probe.
   A major point of contention in the new indictment promises to be
the government's attempt to seize under the RICO law $3.7 billion
from each of the defendants _ twice the total amount of their
salaries, stock holdings and other compensation from 1984 through
1987, plus interest. In addition, Michael Milken faces a sentence
of up to 520 years in prison.
   The indictment says Michael Milken amassed a fortune of more
than $1 billion in the four years through his prowess as the head
of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based high-yield bond division,
in part from his relationship with Boesky.
   It maintains that all money made by the men _ through illict
trades or not _is tainted because it constitutes ``the proceeds of
their unlawful schemes and their interest in the racketeering
enterprise charged.'' Drexel is considered the racketeering
enterprise and Michael Milken its leader.
   The charges against Milken include using illegal inside
information about merger proposals to arrange deals and stock
manipulation. Only one transaction has not been publicized before.
   The government has 70 days to bring its case to trial unless a
judge grants an extension or defense attorneys file motions
delaying the case, which they said is likely.
   ``We will fight this case in the courts, the sanctuary of due
process, not in the press,'' said Arthur L. Liman, Michael Milken's
attorney. ``You cannot cross-examine a leak, you can cross-examine
a Boesky.''

   Here is a brief rundown of the government's more
than 2-year-old investigation of the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. and its high-yield bond financier Michael R. Milken:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CRIMINAL CHARGES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm last December agreed
to plead guilty to six felony counts for securities and mail fraud
and pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution.
   The charges brought by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan
included stock manipulation, fraudulent filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and a stock ``parking'' scheme with
now-imprisoned inside trader Ivan Boesky.
   Drexel said it agreed to the deal with the government rather
than face a racketeering indictment that could have frozen its
assets and crippled its operations.
   Under the deal, Drexel agreed to fire Michael Milken and
withhold his 1988 compensation, estimated at between $100 million
and $200 million. It agreed to similar terms for Milken's brother,
Lowell, a Drexel executive.
   The Milkens and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg were
charged Wednesday in a 98-count racketeering and securities fraud
indictment handed up by a federal grand jury.
   Drexel will not formally plead guilty under the criminal plea
bargain until the firm settles civil charges with the SEC and a
federal judge approves the deals.
   The government began investigating Drexel and Milken in late
1986 after the firm was named by Boesky, who agreed to pay $100
million and cooperate with the government to settle insider trading
charges against him.

   The SEC last September accused Drexel, Milken and five others of
fraudulent schemes including insider trading, stock manipulation,
failure to disclose stock ownership and other violations of
securities laws. The civil complaint says Milken schemed with
Boesky in at least 16 transactions that violated securities laws.
   Negotiations between Drexel and the SEC hit numerous roadblocks
and stalled earlier this month when the government demanded the
firm fire Milken before the settlement was completed. One proposed
condition would bans Milken from the firm for life and bars other
Drexel employees from talking business with him.
   The SEC deal is a precondition for settlement of criminal
charges against the firm.

   Milken has denied all allegations against him. He has been a
focus of government investigators for more than two years.
   The 42-year-old junk bond financier received a letter from the
government last fall indicating he would be indicted on charges
including racketeering and securities fraud.
   Milken is challenging Drexel's criminal settlement in federal
court, charging it violates his constitutional rights by forcing
the firm to fire him and withhold his 1988 pay. An April hearing is
scheduled. The case is not expected to derail the plea agreement.

   Financier Michael Milken, accused
racketeer, also has been called a devoted father, a generous
supporter of charity and creator of the most innovative financial
engine of the century.
   Milken, 42, head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield
bond division, was indicted Wednesday by a Manhattan federal grand
jury for massive securities law and racketeering violations in the
Ivan Boesky insider-trading probe.
   While the indictment apparently will cost the trader his job and
compensation of more than $100 million a year, the much-publicized
investigation has done little to dim Milken's image in the eyes of
friends _ and those who have profited from the junk-bond market he
created.
   As recently as January, Barbara Firestone, who runs a Los
Angeles organization for retarded or emotionally disturbed
children, sang the praises of a man who has donated hundreds of
thousands of dollars and given unstintingly of his time.
   ``It's not the man you see in the newspaper,'' Ms. Firestone
said of Milken.
   Through three family foundations, Milken and his brother,
Lowell, gave more than $17 million to 200 charities over the last
six years.
   Milken's place in modern financial history appears assured by
his role as the virtually single-handed creator of the modern
market in junk bonds.
   The high-risk, high-interest bonds have been used to quickly
raise large cash war chests for corporate takeover strategists and
to fund business expansion by those who couldn't persuade banks or
more conservative venture capitalists to back their efforts.
   A dozen years ago, Milken began preaching the value of the
bonds, which were issued by companies not strong enough to command
favorable ratings from the agencies that advise investors on the
soundness of corporate bonds. Because they are low rated, junk
bonds have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors than
do bonds with higher ratings.
   Milken reasoned that by buying a diverse portfolio of junk
bonds, an investor could hedge against the risk of default by any
one company. The explosive growth of the junk bond market,
responsible in part for waves of corporate takeovers in recent
years, is credited to Milken's fervant advocacy.
   Drexel dominated the market, largely because of Milken, who
presided over an informal network of satisfied clients. Those who
had successfully financed a deal by selling junk bonds stood
willing to buy bonds issued by others.
   In 1977, Milken pulled off a coup by persuading Drexel to let
him move the junk bond division from Manhattan to Beverly Hills,
near his boyhood home of Encino.
   He lives there now with his children and wife, Lori, in a home
once owned by Clark Gable.
   ``Being separated from my life's work is an extremely difficult
step,'' Milken said in a statement Wednesday. ``I am enormously
proud of my 20 years with Drexel Burnham Lambert and it has been an
honor to work with the company's dedicated employees.''

<HEAD>Exxon Oil Spill Experts Reportedly Took Early Retirement</HEAD>

   At least nine oil spill experts, including Exxon
Corp.'s senior environmental officer, left the company during
personnel cutbacks in 1985 and 1986, a specialist in oil pollution
said.
   It's not clear whether the departures affected the company's
response when one of its tankers struck a reef off Alaska and
leaked 10.1 million gallons of crude oil, said Richard S. Golob,
publisher of Golob's Oil Pollution Bulletin.
   But, he said Wednesday, ``It might be a contributing factor
because they do not have the same experienced cadre of oil spill
professionals that they had prior to the 1986 early retirement
offer.
   ``This is not just an Exxon problem. It's an industry-wide
problem,'' he added.
   Exxon Co. USA spokesman Les Rogers said the company is confident
it has the expertise it needs to tackle Friday's spill in Prince
William Sound. In addition to its own staff, he said, those who
have retired are readily available and the company already has
tapped two former employees as consultants.
   ``One went up on the first plane'' from Houston to Alaska on
Friday, Rogers said.
   Seven of the nine experts left five Exxon subsidiaries and
affiliates in 1986 during an industrywide slump, when Exxon and
other oil companies offered retirement incentives to reduce their
workforces, Golob said.
   An eighth expert in oil spill response departed in 1985, and a
ninth left either in 1985 or 1986, he said.
   Even earlier, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium
operating Alaska's Port of Valdez, cut back its staff of oil-spill
experts, The Seattle Times reported Tuesday.
   The newspaper quoted James Woodle, general manager of the port
from 1982-84, and Jerry Nebel, Alyeska oil-spill response
coordinator in 1981-82, as saying they were fired for complaining
about the cutbacks.
   Exxon's Alaska coordinator, Don Cornett, told the newspaper he
was not aware of any such cutbacks at Alyeska. Exxon is part of the
Alyeska consortium.
   Golob said the frequency of major spills has declined in the
last few years and career opportunities in the field have
decreased. But an environmentalist said staff departures should
raise a red flag.
   ``It would be troubling if the company did not replace those
people with equally knowledgable spill response personnel,'' said
Lisa Speer, senior staff scientist with the Natural Resources
Defense Council in New York. ``While Exxon is clearly trying to do
everything they can right now, the response has really been
inexcusably slow.''
   ``We think we have acted responsibly and promptly,'' Exxon's
Rogers said from Houston. ``We were moving a good deal of material
up to the Alaska area from the very start, and we were employing
that equipment and materiel as soon as it got there.''
   A New York oil industry analyst confirmed deep staff cuts at
most oil companies, but said he had no indication that oil spill
control suffered more than any other area of the industry.
   Stephen Smith, an analyst with Bear Sterns, compared keeping a
large staff of oil spill experts to buying insurance. ``If it's not
a here and now present danger, those people are not essential,'' he
said.
   A spokesman for Atlantic Richfield Co. said the company had
trimmed its workforce by more than 19 percent starting in 1985, but
insisted its oil spill programs had not been affected.
   ``Obviously in the process there we lost a number of skilled
people,'' ARCO spokesman Albert Greenstein said in an telephone
interview from Los Angeles Wednesday. ``But to imply that the oil
spill effort suffered as a result of that is really off base.''
   ``It's not a matter of having a handful of `experts' who know
how to fight spills,'' Greenstein added.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors are seeking staggering
prison terms and billions of dollars in penalties _ plus $257
million in interest _ against Michael R. Milken and two others
charged in a mammoth racketeering and fraud indictment.
   A federal grand jury in Manhattan handed up a 98-count
indictment Wednesday against the Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk
bond financier, his brother Lowell and former Drexel trader Bruce
Lee Newberg.
   The long-expected indictment was the biggest development yet in
the snowballing Ivan Boesky insider trading investigation that has
stunned Wall Street for more than two years.
   The three are charged with turning Drexel into a billion-dollar
racketeering enterprise that allegedly used its high-yield, or
junk, bond department for a series of securities fraud schemes with
various unindicted co-conspirators, including the now-imprisoned
Boesky and members of defunct investment partnership
Princeton-Newport LP.
   ``This three-year investigation has uncovered substantial fraud
in a very significant segment of the American financity,'' said U.S. Attorney
Benito Romano.
   Romano said the $1.85 billion in forfeitures were tgainst individuals
under the federal Racketeer Influenced
and C   Milken has headed Drexel's junk bond department since the
mid-1970s and is credited with turning the high-risk, high-yield
securities into a $175 billion annual market. The bonds often are
used to finance corporate takeovers and the growth of small- to
medium-sizedompanies.
   The indictment described the Beverly Hills, Califbased
department as ``the driving force behind Drexel's business,''
noting that between 1983 ait accounted for nearly half of
Drexel's profitl three defendants denied wrongdoing and said they would
plead
nnocent.
   ``The allegations against me are b Lowell Milken said
in a statement. ``The proof will show that  virtually no
contacts with Ivan Boesky, and that I had little, if anything, to
do with the events the prosecumisrepresent in order to
construct their charges.
   ``I have been thrown into this indictment because of a fact in
which I take great pride _ I am Michael Milken's brother.''
   Michael Milken said he would plead innocent ``and vigorse accusations.''
   ``In America an indictment marks the beginning of the legal
process, not the end. After  2{ years of leaks and
distortions I am now eager to present all the facts in an open and
unbiased forum,'' hitatement said.
   Newberg and several Princeton-Newport partners were indicted
last year on fraud and racketeering counts in another stock case,
which defentorneys claimed was brought to pressure them into
cooperating against Drexel.
   Newberg's lawyers, Gerald Lefcourt and Frederick P. Hafetz,
called the second racketeering indictment ``a total perversion of
the RICO statute.''
   If convicted on the racketeering counts alone, prosecutors said,
the defendants face maximum fines of $3.7 billion each. All three
face maximum prison sentences of 20 years on e two
racketeering charges.
  ition, the three are subject to forfeiture proceedings on
virtually all money they have made through their Drexel dealings
since 1984, an estimated $1.85 billion.
   That includes $1.2 billion in salaries, $112 million in Drexel
stock, $205 million in corporate finance fees, $37 million in
tradingon allegedly tainted deals and $257 million in
``calculated at a blended rate of 7.91 percent.''
   Michael Milken also was charged with all of the 96
non-racketeering counts, which include numerous mail, wire and
securities charges. Lowell Milken was charged with 11 counts and
Newberg was charged with 20 counts.
   Each faces a maximum penalty of five years and at least $250,000
in fines on each of the non-racketeering charges _ making Michael
Milken subject to $24 million in fines and a total of 520 years
imprisonment.
   The indictment palleled the Securities and Exchann's sweeping civil
insider trading action against Drexel,
Milken and others last September.
   In December, D struck a plea bargain with federal
prosecutors that called for the dismissal of Milken and the
withholding of most of his 1988 compensation _ estimated at be100 million
and $200 million.
   As part of the plea bargain, which Drexel says it made to avoid
crippling racketeering charges, the firm agreed to plead guideral felony
charges and pay $650 million in fines and
penaltie
   Drexel has not yet pleaded to the charges, and settlement of the
criminal case remained sval.
   Drexel also agreed to withhold half the money due Lowell Milken
for 1988 if he were indicted. His compensation in 198 $48
million, according to the indictment. A Drnt said the
Milkens had been placed on leave of absence.
   ``We are saddened by the terrible disruption to the lives and
cars of these people, especially when viewed againns made by Michael and
his department in the opening of
new captal markets to hundreds of companies and helping to create
hundreds of thousands of jobs,'' Drexel said.

   That beer your favorite movie star quaffed in
his most recent film may be part of an ``insidious'' advertising
scheme, according to an advocacy group that wants to require
moviemakers to reveal when they're being paid to show commercial
products.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest says the movie
``Bull Durham'' included 21 shots of Miller Lite beer, ``Superman
II'' featured the Marlboro cigarette logo, and ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial'' prominently displayed Reese's Pieces and Coors
beer.
   While the center didn't know if money changed hands between
filmmakers and manufacturers on all these movies, it said Philip
Morris paid $42,500 to get its Marlboro logo into the Superman film.
   On the coming James Bond movie, ``Licensed to Kill,'' Philip
Morris paid $350,000 to have Lark cigarettes shown on screen,
center staff attorney Charles Mitchell said.
   The center is asking state attorneys general to determine
whether the undisclosed placement of commercial products in films
constitutes deceptive advertising that violates state laws.
   It also said broadcasting movies on television in which there
are paid placements of cigarettes violates a 1971 law that
prohibits advertising of cigarettes on TV.
   Mitchell said the center urged states to require filmmakers to
state at the beginning of a movie, for example: ``Notice. This film
contains paid advertising for Marlboro cigarettes.''
   The center also said it would ask state officials to determine
whether the placement of alcoholic beverages and cigarettes in
youth-oriented films should be prohibited because youths cannot
legally buy such products.
   The group said it was petitioning the Federal Communications
Commission to rescind a rule that exempts theatrical films from the
general requirement for television programs that paid product
placements be disclosed.
   ``The paid placement of junk foods, alcoholic beverages and
cigarettes in movies is one of the most insidious forms of
advertising,'' said Michael Jacobson, the center's executive
director. ``Advertising in movies is blatantly unfair to audiences
who go to be entertained, not advertised to.''
   Elizabeth Barnes, a spokeswoman for the Motion Picture
Association of America, said the association had no comment.
   Rep. Tom Luken, D-Ohio, on March 17 asked Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to investigate whether paid placement of cigarettes in
movies made for theaters and then shown on television violates the
1971 Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act that prohibits
cigarette ads on TV.
   A senior aide to Luken, who spoke only on condition he not be
identified, said the $350,000 and $42,500 payments from Philip
Morris were made directly to the producers of the films. Liggett &amp;
Meyers also paid $30,000 to have its Eve cigarettes appear in
``Supergirl,'' the aide said.
   ``Our position is that if you show `Superman' or `Supergirl' ...
on TV you violated that law,'' the aide said.
   Violating the act is punishable by a fine of up to $10,000.
   Steven Weiss, a spokesman for Philip Morris U.S.A., said the
$350,000 payment was the total for a six-month promotional campaign
that was to coincide with the Bond film's premiere in Japan, where
Philip Morris markets Lark. He said the product placement portion
was only a ``small amount'' of the $350,000.
   He said Philip Morris' policy is not to pay for use of its
products or logos in movies but that it will provide such materials
free.
   ``When requests are made of us ... we will do so only if there
is a smoking scene already in the film. But we don't pay to have
our products placed in films,'' Weiss said.
   Weiss said Liggett &amp; Myers markets Lark in the United States and
that Philip Morris could not benefit from Lark appearing in the
U.S. showings of the Bond film.
   Luken's aide said the Bond movie script specifies the use of
Lark cigarettes. The contract for the product placement also says
if Philip Morris doesn't like what it sees on screen, it can get
its money back, the aide said.
   Weiss said he was unaware of that contract language.

<HEAD>Growing Concern in Canada About Alaskan Oil Spill ^With PM-Tanker

   Despite official predictions that oil from the
largest U.S. spill ever will not reach Canadian waters, the
spreading Alaskan slick is causing growing concern about Arctic
development and tanker shipping.
   ``I think it's so massive that we just don't know what we're
going to do with it at this time,'' Arne Hansen of the Western
Canada Wilderness Committee said Wednesday by telephone from
Vancouver, British Columbia.
   He said the the environmental group long has been worried about
supertankers in the Pacific lanes off of Canada.
   ``We had been expecting a spill like this for years,'' Hansen
said. ``It's like a meltdown of a nuclear reactor.''
   The spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound has been a leading
news story in Canada since the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on
Friday.
   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard told reporters Tuesday at a
meeting in Meech Lake, Quebec, that it might be a good idea to
review the Canada-U.S. agreement on West Coast oil shipping.
   ``We are concerned about what happened because we know that
these kind of disasters can happen everywhere,'' he said. ``So we
will see what we can do for the future.''
   Bouchard and his aides have said repeatedly that it is unlikely
the oil spill off Valdez, Alaska, will directly affect Canadian
waters or shores.
   When asked about the U.S. plan to allow some oil and gas
drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge bordering Canada, Bouchard
said the Arctic ``is an extremely fragile area.''
   ``We are extremely worried, we are opposed to this,'' he said.
   The Canadian government has said it opposes the plan for the
Alaskan development next to its Yukon territory because it could
disrupt the migratory patterns of the porcupine caribou herd.
   James Fulton, environment critic for the socialist New
Democratic Party, predicted in a telephone interview from Ottawa
that some oil from the Valdez spill eventually will affect Canadian
territory even if the prevailing currents move the bulk of it north.
   ``I've looked at all of the most recent tidal and current
charts,'' he said. ``I don't think there's much doubt that some of
the spill is likely to reach Canadian territory.''
   Fulton represents in Parliament British Columbia's Skeena
district, which includes the province's northwestern Pacific coast.
   He said the difficulties in the cleanup show that the oil
industry's ``state of prepardeness is very close to zero.''
   Calls to his office have been running 9-to-1 in favor of action
such as a halt to tanker traffic, Fulton said.
   ``People are mad,'' he said. ``People are getting really sick
and tired of being kicked around by large corporations.''

<HEAD>MCorp's Failure Caused By Domino-Effect Of Energy Bust, Analysts
Say</HEAD>

   MCorp, which declared itself ``a momentum
company'' when it was formed five years ago, was the victim of
Texas' downward economic spiral caused by falling oil prices even
though the bank holding company poured more money into real estate
than energy, analysts said.
   The $18 billion, 25-bank holding company was stripped of all but
five banks by Wednesday after federal regulators declared the banks
involvent. The government pumped in $300 million in what likely
will become the third largest commercial bank rescue ever.
   The 20 banks were combined into the government-owned Deposit
Insurance Bridge Bank NA, while officials search for a buyer for
some of all of the banks.
   ``Once the Texas real estate markets began to slip, there really
was very little they could do,'' said banking analyst Michael Starr
at Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ``What you're seeing in the real
estate market is simply what started a decade ago in energy
problems. ... MCorp is at the tail-end of feeling those problems.''
   MCorp probably was guilty of ``over-aggressive lending,'' Starr
said, but not to the extent of other Texas banks. Most of its
loans, he said, were made to reputable developers, unlike many
troubled thrifts that had backed inexperienced developers.
   ``The straightforward, honest answer is that the state of Texas
was hit by an economic H-bomb that had effects on real estate
portfolios, energy portfolios ...,'' said Robert D. Rieke, a
banking analyst with the Dallas firm of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc.
   ``To its tribute, MCorp has been able to withstand the fallout
longer than anybody else,'' said Rieke, once a vice-president and
treasurer at MCorp.
   MCorp, which has yet to report annual earnings, also has blamed
its troubles on real estate, telling stockholders last December
that ``asset quality problems, largely related to loans secured by
real estate and assets acquired through foreclosure, adversely
affected the company's financial performance'' in the third
quarter, when MCorp posted a $517 million loss. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. has said MCorp's banks lost another $213 million in
the fourth quarter and $903 million for the year.
   While a weak real estate climate hurt MCorp, its final tumble
began last week when a Connecticut bond trader and two employees _
who together held just over $2 million in bonds _ moved to force
the company into bankruptcy because they had not been paid since
October when the company announced a moratorium on payments on $470
million in bonds and preferred stock.
   MCorp's response on Monday was to announce it would seek
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. The resulting uncertainty apparently set off a run on
deposits.
   Federal regulators, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
between $50 million and $100 million was withdrawn Tuesday from the
flagship MBank Dallas. The withdrawals came both from individual
depositors and some of MCorp's other subsidiary banks, the
regulators said.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas called in a loan to MBank
Dallas, but the bank couldn't pay and was declared insolvent.
   ``Depositors at 19 of the failed institutions, including those
with funds in excess of the $100,000 insurance limit, were fully
protected,'' the FDIC said. At MBank Abliene, only deposits up to
the insurance limit were transferred.
   All the banks remain open for business as usual, with former
MCorp employees now working for the government.
   The remaining five MBanks, in Brownsville, Corpus Christi, El
Paso, New Braunfels and Waco, plus a trust and investment
subsidiary ``form the nucleus of a new beginning for MCorp,'' the
company said Wednesday.
   ``While the nature of MCorp has been altered dramatically, a
solid healthy core remains,'' said MCorp Chairman Gene H. Bishop.
   But analysts are unsure whether MCorp can survive in any form.
   MCorp still faces claims against its remaining assets by
bondholders and the FDIC, which Chairman William Seidman said holds
``substantial'' claims against the parent company.
   Analysts said it is unlikely those claims can be resolved in any
fashion other than liquidation.
   The government's rescue came almost six months after MCorp had
asked for federal assistance.
   Bishop and other managers had put together their own bid for the
bank, but the FDIC _ rather than acting on the plan _ opened up the
bidding to all comers, setting an April 3 deadline.
   Seidman said Wednesday that deadline may be extended. Several
groups have been reportedly looking at MCorp's books, including
Wells Fargo & Co.; leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co., apparently representing management; interests of Chicago's
wealthy Pritzker family, which controls the Hyatt hotel chain; and
First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc., itself the recipient of federal
assistance.

<HEAD>IRS Promise of Speedy Refunds Won't Last Long</HEAD>

   The Internal Revenue Service, nearing the end
of a tax filing season that so far has been almost a breeze, is
still promising refunds within six weeks _ but not for long.
   ``Those who file closer to the (April 17) deadline will probably
have to wait longer for their refund,'' the IRS said Wednesday in
renewing its ``file early'' plea.
   The agency said that heading into the last three weeks of the
filing season, more than half the 109 million couples and
individuals who are expected to submit returns sometime this year
still had not done so. That means a crunch as the deadline
approaches, with nearly 32 million returns expected in the final
two weeks.
   But while that represents about 30 percent of the year's total,
it is about the same percentage of procrastinators as in 1988, the
IRS said.
   Through last Friday, the IRS had received 53.1 million returns,
up 0.7 percent from 52.8 million during the same period a year ago.
The agency's 10 service centers had processed 3.3 percent more than
at this time last year: 42.4 million compared with 41.1 million in
1988.
   Three of the 10 centers _ in Atlanta, Memphis and Austin, Texas
_ have processed slighly fewer returns than they had at this time a
year ago.
   That is not a matter of concern, said IRS spokesman Frank Keith,
because those three centers were given new territories this year as
the agency redistributed its workload and have received fewer
returns so far. The important statistic, Keith said, is that the
three have processed more returns than they had been scheduled to.
   The only black mark on this year's filing season from the IRS'
perspective is the low accuracy rate on answering taxpayers'
telephoned questions.
   In some areas of the country, IRS surveys found, the agency's
``assistors'' are correct barely half the time. Nationwide, these
5,000 employees gave incorrect responses to 30.8 percent of test
questions.
   Publicity about those wrong answers could account for the fact
that fewer taxpayers are calling the agency's toll-free answer line
with specific tax questions. Through last week, 19.3 million calls
had been received, down from 20.6 million during the same period a
year ago.
   On the other hand, the number of calls received by the IRS
Tele-Tax system has nearly tripled _ from 5.4 million to 15.1
million. Tele-Tax, whose toll-free numbers and subject list are
included in the back of the instruction packages mailed by the IRS,
offers tape-recorded advice on more than 140 tax topics.
   You may call the same number if you have not received your
refund. You will need the first Social Security number shown on
your return, your filing status and the exact amount of your refund.
   More than 74 percent (31.4 million) of the returns so far this
year have been certified for refunds totaling $25.6 billion, an
average refund of almost $816. At this time last year, 75 percent
of filers (30.8 million) had had refunds approved. Those refunds
totaled $25.2 billion and averaged $817.

<HEAD>Crazy Eddie Announces Widespread Store Closings To Restore Health</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crazy Eddie Inc. is closing 17 of 43 stores
in four states in a bid to revive its electronics retail business.
   The decision was made final late Tuesday, and workers learned of
the closings Wednesday, when the chosen outlets shut their doors,
said spokeswoman Omi Walden.
   ``Of course we would prefer not to have to do it that way, but
circumstances did not permit otherwise,'' she said.
   ``The objective here was to cut losses and to improve
profitability. There was a need to move as quickly as possible,''
said Walden.
   Ms. Walden said she did not know how many employees were
involved. The affected stores were in New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut and Pennsylvania.
   In a three-paragraph statement announcing the closings, the
financially troubled company said it wanted to concentrate on its
26 ``best performing and most competitive stores.''
   Crazy Eddie, known for its frenetic broadcast commercials and
claims of ``Our prices are insane!,'' said it would meet with its
major vendors to discuss ``liquidity problems'' and a possible
financial restructuring. Ms. Walden declined to comment on what
that might be.
   A ``massive inventory shortage, excessive long-term debt and
certain unprofitable store locations'' inherited from previous
management has drained working capital, said company president
Peter A. Martosella Jr.
   Compounding the problems was a big drop in sales, Martosella
said. Crazy Eddie said it lost $8 million for the third quarter of
1988, ended November 27. Fourth quarter figures are being prepared,
said Ms. Walden.
   Crazy Eddie's stock closed at 53 cents a share Wednesday,
unchanged from the previous close. It had been as high as $21 three
years ago.
   Elias Zinn, founder of Houston-based Electronics Marketing Inc.,
and turnaround specialist Victor Palmieri took over Crazy Eddie in
November 1987 from reclusive founder Eddie Antar. Palmieri is
chairman and Zinn, who stepped down as president earlier this year,
remains a director.
   Early on, the new management told of internal turmoil and
inventory shortfalls. Vendors complained of unpaid bills, and
investors sued.
   The new management has struggled to build the company back. It
lined up new credit, computerized the inventory, worked on customer
service and last summer restructured debt.
   The company closed three of 11 stores in New Jersey; 10 of 21 in
New York; two of seven in Connecticut; and two of four in
Pennsylvania.

<HEAD>EEC Seeks Strict Rules For Tobacco Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission Thursday proposed to
ban advertisements by tobacco makers for non-tobacco products and
said visible health warnings should be printed on all tobacco
advertising.
   Ads for clothing and other non-tobacco items using a symbol or
trademark of a tobacco brand will be banned if the 12 EEC states
adopt the European Economic Community Commsision proposal.
   It also suggested forcing tobacco makers to display any of 12
health warnings in their ads and that ads for a particular brand of
cigarettes only show a pack of cigarettes and their tar content.
   Any warning about the health hazards of smoking should cover at
least 10 percent of the advertisements' total space, the Commission
recommended.
   The Commission said in a statement it made its proposals as part
of its `Europe Against Cancer' program. Annually, 440,000 EEC
nationals die of diseases caused or aggravated by smoking, it said.
   The requirement that only a cigarette packet and the tar content
be shown in advertisements is already in effect in France.
   But of the 12 EEC states only Portugal and Ireland have a total
ban on tobacco advertising. Greece, Luxembourg and Spain have few
restrictions on such ads.
   In the other six EEC nations tobacco ads must carry the same
health warning that appears on the packet.
   The Commission's proposals for EEC-wide rules on tobacco ads
must be approved by the European Parliament and the 12 EEC states
before they can take effect.

<HEAD>Amoco Production Plans to Cut 800 Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 800 Amoco Production Co. employees will be
cut from company payrolls as part of a reorganization this spring,
reflecting a trend by major oil companies to emphasize foreign
exploration and production over U.S. operations.
   Amoco Production is the oil and gas exploration subsidiary of
Amoco Corp., the nation's fifth-largest energy company, and
officials say the reductions are designed to reduce costs and
better focus resources.
   The cuts announced Wednesday amount to about 10 percent of the
U.S. employees, officials said.
   The subsidiary has 15,000 workers worldwide, including about
8,000 U.S. citizens who are paid in U.S. dollars no matter where
they work, according to spokesman Richard Judy of Chicago-based
Amoco Corp.
   The job cuts, slated to begin in May, would come through
placement of employees with other Amoco Corp. subsidiaries,
voluntary retirement, voluntary resignation and some firings, the
company said.
   The reductions will be made ``to reduce our costs and focus our
resources _ money, physical assets and people _ on those areas
where the projected financial returns are the most attractive,''
said Patrick J. Early, president of Amoco Production.
   Early said the changes reflect general trends of shrinking the
company's domestic organization while expanding international
operations.
   For the first time in its 100-year history, Amoco plans to spend
more money in 1989 searching for oil and gas abroad than in the
United States.
   The company said it plans to take advantage of its strong
natural gas reserve position, look into property trades with other
companies and continue divesting marginal and non-strategic
properties.
   The reorganization of Amoco's U.S. exploration and production
operations follows similar moves recently by Texaco Inc., Atlantic
Richfield Co. and Phillips Petroleum Co.
   ``The majors are looking in foreign areas because they've got a
better chance of finding a big field there,'' said Ray Beresford, a
principal of International Energy Consultants Ltd. in Morristown,
N.J.
   ``The Lower 48 (states) is pretty well picked over, and the only
hopes of a big field in the U.S. _ Alaska or offshore California _
you can't touch'' because of environmental concerns, he said.
   In the last year, U.S. oil production has dropped 5 percent.
   Amoco Corp. and its subsidiaries employ 55,000 people worldwide.
The energy and chemical company sold 6 percent of all refined
petroleum products in the United States last year, and had 1988
revenues of $23.9 billion, Judy said.

<HEAD>Unisys Expects First-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer giant Unisys Corp. expects to lose
up to $80 million in the year's first quarter partly because of the
Navy's suspension of bidding rights for three of its defense
divisions.
   The company also cited slow sales of its 1100 line of mainframe
computers, which was replaced by the 2200 series last month.
   In a statement Wednesday, Unisys said it anticipates turning a
profit in the second quarter as it steps up delivery of the 2200
series mainframes.
   The estimated loss for the quarter ending Friday would be about
55 cents to 65 cents per common share, the company said. It expects
to report final first-quarter results April 21.
   Michael Geran, an analyst with Nikko Securities International in
New York, said the projected loss was higher than the $20 million
to $25 million he had expected.
   ``But once you go negative, there's a natural tendency to throw
everything but the kitchen sink in,'' he said.
   Unisys said the government's ``Operation Ill Wind''
investigation and the indefinite suspension of three defense
divisions caused disruption and added costs during the quarter.
   The Navy announced earlier this month that it had suspended
bidding rights of the Shipboard and Ground Systems Group, the
Computer Systems Division and the Communications Systems Division
of Unisys.
   The former Sperry Corp. divisions _ based in Great Neck, N.Y.,
Eagan, Minn., and Salt Lake City, Utah _ provided 70 percent of
Unisys' defense-related revenues.
   Peter Hynes, a Unisys spokesman, said the suspended units
performed about $1.6 billlion worth of federal government work last
year. Unisys as a whole had $9.9 billion in revenues last year.
   The suspension came less than a week after a former Unisys vice
president and a former Unisys consultant pleaded guilty in federal
court in Alexandria, Va., to trying to bribe former Navy officials.
   Another Unisys executive and a second Unisys consultant entered
guilty pleas on Jan. 27 to making illegal campaign contributions to
members of Congress.
   Unisys was formed when Burroughs Corp. took over Sperry in 1986
in a $4.8 billion deal.
   The company also said first-quarter sales were affected by a
restructuring of its U.S. computer business, the formation of new
product groups and the integration of Convergent Technologies Inc.,
a California computer company acquired in 1988.
   The company said in February it had laid off 1,700 employees at
60 U.S. sites and would close an assembly plant in Nogales, Mexico,
terminating 400 jobs.

   Polaroid Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co.
will meet in court May 1 in the damages phase of their patent
infringement case.
   U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone postponed the previous date
of April 17, Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips said Wednesday.
   In 1985 Kodak was found guilty by U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel
in Boston of violating several Polaroid patents. But Zobel revealed
during preparation for the damages phase of the trial that she had
inherited $100,000 in Kodak stock.
   Kodak requested that Zobel disqualify herself from the case,
that all her orders in the 13-year-old dispute be nullified and a
new trial held. Zobel stepped aside, but Mazzone refused to have
her orders vacated. The First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
Mazzone's decision on Feb. 17.
   Polaroid is seeking $5.7 billion, but Kodak lawyers have said
$200 million would be ``more than ample.''

<HEAD>American, Soviet Businessmen Sign Major Trade Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of American and Soviet businessmen said
Thursday they have signed an agreement that could create joint
ventures worth up to $10 billion over the next two decades.
   The agreement reached by the American Trade Consortium and the
Soviet Foreign Economic Consortium establishes a legal and business
framework for the development of joint ventures between the two
groups.
   It was the first time a private commericial agreement was signed
in the Kremlin and caps a year of negotiations, said James H.
Giffen, president of the American group.
   Some of the possible joint ventures could include oilseed
processing, manufacture of floppy discs and production of crackers
and cereals.
   Giffen said difficult issues such as ways to repatriate profits
earned in the Soviet Union and how investments will be made had
been resolved ``in principle'' by the agreement.
   However, he declined to provide details of how profits would be
taken out of the Soviet Union.
   Repatriation of profits has been the key problem for Western
companies trying to do business in the Soviet Union. The Soviet
ruble is not convertible, and any profits earned in rubles are
worthless outside the country.
   Feasibility studies will be conducted over the next year and
Giffen said the first of some 25 joint ventures could start up
within 18 months.
   The U.S. consortium consists of six companies, including Archer
Daniels Midland, Chevron Corp., Eastman Kodak Co., Johnson &amp;
Johnson, RJR Nabisco Inc., and the Mercator Corp.
   Ford Motor Co., the seventh member of the group, announced
Thursday that it has pulled out of the consortium, saying that the
accomplishments between the American Trade Consortium and the
Soviets had not gone far enough.
   Ford's withdrawal will not affect the future of the project,
Giffen said at a news conference. He said Ford had been looking at
the project for about a year and that the timing of the withdrawal
with the signing of the agreement was ``coincidental.''

   A federal appeals court has effectively cleared
the way for a California company to pursue its $970 million
takeover bid for Prime Computer Inc., turning attention to an
expected proxy fight at Prime's annual meeting in May.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that an
injunction blocking MAI Basic Four Inc.'s bid would be lifted after
the Tustin, Calif.-based company provided specific details of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s financial involvement in the deal.
   The court upheld a December ruling by U.S. District Judge A.
David Mazzone, who was ordered to lift the injunction once
appropriate discloures are made.
   MAI Basic has offered $20 a share for Natick-based Prime, which
is four times the size of its suitor.
   William B. Patton, MAI Basic's president, said the court
explicitly stated what information needs to be provided.
   ``Once that's provided, the injunction will be lifted,'' said
Patton.
   The court decision requires MAI Basic to provide Drexel
financial statements, records of recent stock trading activity and
identification of all Drexel-affiliated officers and directors.
   Patton said the legal fight over MAI's bid for Prime could prove
moot after Prime's shareholders hold their annual meeting on May 12.
   ``The whole thing is going to come down to a proxy fight
anyway,'' Patton said in a telephone interview from California.
``We've applied to the SEC for approval and we're expecting it any
day. After that, the court actions become nothing more than legal
jostling.''
   But Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan said the appeals court ruling
affirmed the company's position that stockholders needed additional
information to make an educated decision in the takeover battle.
   ``Basically we feel that the lower court decision being upheld
will ultimately serve our shareholders in obtaining for them the
additional information that we've argued needs to be disclosed
here,'' Gavaghan said.
   Mazzone last month continued the order blocking MAI's bid while
asking for additional information about how Drexel Burnham would
finance the deal.
   In January, MAI Basic said officials at the New York firm were
confident they could raise the $875 million to finance the takeover
despite its guilty plea in a massive securities fraud settlement.
   Patton said Wednesday that MAI officials would work with Drexel
Burnham to comply with the court's guidelines and disclose all
pertinent documents.

   The stock market declined slightly today,
hesitating after its rally of the past three sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 38.48 points in the
week's first three trading days, slipped back 3.84 to 2,277.68 in
the first half hour of trading this morning.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 402 up, 422 down and 548

   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.20 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that new factory
orders declined 2.3 percent in February.
   That provided fresh support for the view that the pace of the
economy began to slow last month.
   But analysts have been reluctant to conclude from a single
month's data that the Federal Reserve has succeeded in its efforts
to subdue inflationary pressures by tightening credit.
   The first indication of whether the slowing continued in March
will come in the Labor Department's monthly employment report late
next week.
   Genentech dropped 1 to 18]. An article in the New England

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .15 to 164.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .35 at 325.23.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.98 points

   A court ordered The Observer newspaper not to
distribute an edition that quotes a secret government report on a
dispute between the paper's owner and the Harrods store chain.
   The Observer, normally published Sunday, was due to be issued at
noon today and included what it claimed were long extracts from a
secret Department of Trade and Industry report on the matter.
   The Observer printed 250,000 copies, but just 10 minutes before
the 16-page paper was due to hit the streets, the trade department
was granted an injunction by Justice Tudor Evans against Lonrho and
The Observer.
   Lonrho PLC, the British conglomerate that owns the Observer, has
been waging a campaign to reverse a takeover of the chain, House of
Fraser PLC, after its own bid to buy the company was thwarted by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   The Egyptian Fayed brothers purchased House of Fraser in 1985
for $1.03 billion. Lonrho says the Fayeds made a series osPfqlsarr

   Centel Corp. says it has found buyers for its two
remaining cable television properties and that it hopes to complete
the $1.4 billion, six-way breakup of the nation's 22nd largest
cable company this fall.
   The Chicago-based communications concern said Wednesday it would
sell its Kentucky cable operation to Simmons Communications Inc. of
Stamford, Conn., and its southeast Florida cable business to
Adelphia Communications Corp. of Coudersport, Pa.
   Centel's cable business in Kentucky has 60,000 subscribers and
its Florida operation serves 125,000 subscribers.
   Adelphia also will acquire the stock of Centel Cable Television
Co., the Centel subsidiary that ran the six cable networks, Centel
said in a statement.
   Centel would not reveal the sale price of each cable property
but said the gross proceeds from the sales of all six units would
be more than $1.4 billion.
   Centel announced the sales last week of its cable operations in
central Florida, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio in four separate
transactions.
   Centel said in late November that it planned to sell its cable
unit to concentrate on its telecommunications businesses, which
include local exchange service in nine states and a cellular
telephone subsidiary that operates in 13 states.
   The company said last week that it would break up its cable
subsidiary and sell the six parts separately.
   Centel said it expects to complete the sales in the third
quarter.

   Orders to U.S. factories fell 2.3 percent in February, the
government said today in a report that added to a string of recent
statistics suggesting economic growth has slowed.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable
manufactured goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted $230.7 billion
last month after declining 1.2 percent in January.
   It was the biggest decline since a 3.6 percent drop last July
and was consistent with a variety of other government reports on
the economy's performance last month that have pointed downward.
   In reports Wednesday, the Commerce Department said new home
sales and the Index of Leading Economic Indicators both declined in
February.
   The index, the government's chief economic forecasting gauge,
fell 0.3 percent last month, the biggest drop since July when the
index slid 0.8 percent.
   Meanwhile, sales of new, single-family homes slumped 9.4 percent
in February to the lowest level in more than a year. Analysts said
further declines are expected as rising mortgage rates push more
people out of the market.
   Sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000
after advancing 2.5 percent in January, when unusually mild weather
brought out more buyers.
   The reports had little effect on the nation's financial markets,
which expected the declines.
   Analysts said the declines were consistent with other recent
signals that the economy may be losing steam _ welcome news to
those who say growth must slow in order to keep inflation from
spiraling.
   ``This should reduce concern about the economy overheating,
while the decline is not sharp enough to give any signal of a
recession,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the
National Association of Manufacturers.
   Others, however, are concerned that the economy will slow too
much and that the Federal Reserve Board's yearlong campaign to
raise interest rates and dampen inflationary pressures will stifle
growth altogether.
   ``The monetary tightening that we have experienced and some
monetary tightening that is probably still to come are going to
cause a downturn,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. in New York.
   Analysts blame the slow home sales pace on the pinch of higher
mortgage interest rates, which forced some lower-income buyers out
of the market.
   The leading index, designed to foretell economic activity six to
nine months into the future, advanced 0.6 percent in December and
0.7 percent in January after vacillating during much of 1988.
   In February, eight of the 11 indicators that make up the leading
index declined, with the biggest negative factor a drop in
manufacturer orders for new plants and equipment.
   The other negative factors were a drop in building permits, a
decline in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, a contraction
in the money supply, a dip in an index of consumer expectations, an
increase in initial claims for unemployment benefits, faster vendor
deliveries to companies signaling slower demand, and a decline in
manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   Two indicators made positive contributions: an increase in
prices for raw materials indicating stronger demand, and rising
stock prices. One indicator was unchanged last month: the length of
the average work week.

   The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries urged its member states Thursday to invest in oil
refining industries to meet new trends in world demand for oil
products.
   An OAPEC statement issued at the end of a three-day seminar on
the Arab refining industry, affirmed ``the need to direct
investment toward building new refining units in the Arab countries
that can process heavy high-sulphur Arab crudes and handle surplus
fuel oil.''
   Such investement ``will increase the marketing potential of Arab
producers, since these crudes constitute a large portion of their
oil reserves,'' the statement said.
   More than 100 delegates and oil experts from Arab countries,
regional and international companies and organizations, including
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, attended the
meeting.
   The Kuwait-based 11-member OAPEC, in which seven countries
double as members of OPEC, provides a forum for coordinating Arab
oil policies.
   OAPEC members are: Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab
Emirates, Iraq, Algeria, Libya, Bahrain, Syria, Tunisia and Egypt.
The first seven are OPEC members.
   The participants noted the share of light products in the total
demand for oil was growing steadily and that there is a trend
toward eliminating pollutants such as sulphur and lead from oil
products in line with new environmental regulations in major
markets.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
reports of rain in major crop-growing areas and speculative selling
ahead of two important government reports.
   Soybean futures have fallen in the past four sessions and the
pattern continued this morning due to rain in the Midwest, slack
export demand and weakening chart signals, analysts said.
   Rainy weather in the Midwest and Great Plains also encouraged
selling of wheat and corn futures, although early losses in the
corn market were limited by the Agriculture Department's
announcement late Wednesday that the Soviet Union had bought
450,000 metric tons of U.S. corn _ Moscow's second major purchase
of U.S. corn this week.
   The USDA will release its quarterly grain stocks report and
annual spring planting estimates after the close on Friday. The
eagerly awaited reports will indicate whether grain prices are
likely to rise or fall this summer, assuming growing conditions are
favorable.
   In early trading, wheat was 2\ cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.25 a bushel; corn was { cent to
1 cent lower with May at $2.72{ a bushel; oats were \ cent to }

   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .50 cent lower with April at 78.32
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower with
April at 81.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent lower to .10
cent higher with April at 41.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .27 cent to .55 cent lower with May at 38.05 cents a pound.

<HEAD>EPA Adds 101 To List Of Most Hazardous Waste Sites</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency today
added 101 sites in 33 states to its list of hazardous waste dumps
that pose the greatest long-term threat to public health and the
environment.
   The additions bring to 1,163 the number of waste sites eligible
for federal funds under the EPA's $8.5 billion ``Superfund''
cleanup program.
   EPA identifies and ranks the sites on its list according to
health threats to nearby populations through contamination of
groundwater, surface water or air. Money for the cleanup fund comes
from taxes mainly on the chemical industry.
   The latest additions to the Superfund list include garbage
dumps, refineries, dry cleaners, chemical dumps and a variety of
manufacturing plants, including a steel company, tanning company,
paint works and a forest products company.
   Pennsylvania had the most sites, 12, followed by New York with
10 and Michigan with seven.
   Of the total sites identified so far, New Jersey's 107 is the
most for any state. Pennsylvania is second with 94, followed by
California with 88. The list was started in 1983.
   The EPA has been under attack for years for the pace of cleanup
under the Superfund program, which was created by Congress in
response to a series of dramatic toxic waste problems that surfaced
in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   Various congressional reports criticized the program last year,
resulting in Congress cutting the cleanup budget by $175 million.
   In a statement accompanying today's announcement that 101 sites
had been added to the Superfund list, EPA Administrator William K.
Reilly said he was trying to speed up the process.
   ``The slow progress of Superfund frustrates a lot of people, I
know,'' he said. ``It frustrates me. At EPA we're looking at ways
to speed up this process and to spur cleanups by responsible
private parties, including making expanded use of enforcement
actions.''
   The latest additions to the cleanup priority list include eight
federal facilities. Although Superfund money cannot be used for
cleanup on federal sites, the EPA said it had decided to put
eligible sites on the list regardless of their regulatory status.
Federal agencies and the military services are required to pay for
hazardous waste site cleanups out of their own budgets.
   The EPA said that in addition to the eight federal sites added
to the Superfund list, it has decided to extend the site area of
the Rocky Mountain Arsenal near Denver, which already was on the
list. The extension was made to include contaminants and releases
from an area of the arsenal called Basin F, the agency said.

   Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
said Thursday that Spain intends to join the European Monetary
System in the near future.
   ``A lot of time will not go by before this decision is made to
join the EMS,'' he said.
   The 10-year-old system is a grid of eight European Economic
Community currencies that by common agreement must move in bands
between fixed upper and lower limits. If they exceed the limits,
central banks must intervene or governments take monetary action.
   Gonzalez said it did not ``seem reasonable to expect a country
to announce in advance precisely when it's going to ask to enter
the EMS.''
   Of the 12 EEC currencies, only the Spanish peseta, the British
pound, the Greek drachma and the Portuguese escudo are not part of
the EMS exchange rate mechanism.
   Spain has said it would join the EMS several other times.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has long been under
pressure to join, has said repeatedly she will do so ``when the
time is right.''

   OPEC ministers pledged today to stand by
an agreement to slash production in the next three months as they
wrapped up a two-day strategy session.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said a panel of eight ministers
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries renewed their
intention to ``adhere very strictly'' in the April-June quarter to
a November pact to slash production.
   The meeting was the organization's first formal review of the
oil market since the accord, which covers the first six months of
the year.
   The ministers addressed tactics for maintaining the surprising
strength of the current market. There had been indications some
ministers ministers wanted to raise the production cap to keep oil
prices from rising too fast.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said, ``Everything is
going very well. ... Everybody is satisfied with the current market
stability.''
   Diego Tamariz, the Ecuadoran oil minister attending the talks as
an observer, said the discussions centered on the market situation
and long-term strategy.
   Since the cartel agreed in November to slash production in the
first half of this year, prices have rallied, unexpectedly reaching
this week the OPEC benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   With firming prices, the ministers were already beginning to
turn their attention to the output accord that will be hammered out
in early June to cover the last half of the year.
   The November arrangement called for the countries to limit their
production to a total of 18.5 million barrels a day, well under the
level of last last year. It also set the target price of $18 a
barrel.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the
cartel reached $18.01 a barrel Tuesday. The price is up more than
$5 a barrel since November.
   The May contract price for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, was up 39 cents in early trading today to
$20.59 cents a 42-gallon barrel after rising 29 cents Wednesday on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The price, the highest for the near-term contract since August
1987, was lifted partly by concern about the oil tanker spill off
Alaska on Friday.
   Prices for West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent blend,
the most widely traded international crudes, have climbed more than
the Middle Eastern crudes offered by the OPEC countries.
   The price surge has been linked to the reduction in OPEC
production as well as unforeseen accidents in producing regions
that have clipped supply. Demand also has been stronger than
forecast.
   Subroto said the monitoring committee would meet ``several
times, many times'' before the June meeeting.
   Sabah indicated in a recent interview with the Middle East
Economic Survey that he would like the daily output cap lifted to
20 million barrels in the last six months of the year.
   Asked Wednesday about the interview, he said, ``It is my
position, but we are reasonable people. We have to look at supply
and demand and decide on that basis. We're going to look at the
figures and then decide in June.''
   Other ministers have been more cautious about urging changes in
the accord. Several have insisted that the cartel must wait to see
how the market acts in the April-June quarter, when prices
generally weaken as demand slips with the coming of warmer weather
in oil importing nations.
   Indepednent oil exporting nations, including the Soviet Union,
have agreed to help OPEC in the second quarter by trimming their
exports to a total of about 300,000 barrels a day.
   Members of the monitoring committee are Algeria, Indonesia,
Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
   Other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates.

<HEAD>Creators Say SuperTrust Fund Proposal Could Be NYSE Volume Leader</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the never-ending search for a strategy
to beat Wall Street, two professors and their partner have created
an innovative investment fund they say could become a New York
Stock Exchange trading leader.
   The SuperTrust investment fund, designed for all kinds of market
conditions, is the brainchild of University of California-Berkeley
finance professors Hayne Leland and Mark Rubinstein and their
associate, John O'Brien.
   The three principals of LOR Associates are better known as the
fathers of portfolio insurance, a hedging strategy that was
supposed to protect institutional investors against market declines
_ but fared poorly in the crash of Oct. 19, 1987.
   Portfolio insurance, in which traders sell stock index futures
and options to reduce the impact of a falling market on their
holdings, was blamed by some for accelerating the crash. LOR
managed more than $60 million in portfolio insurance before the
crash and has since dropped to about $20 million.
   To overcome some failings of portfolio insurance, Leland said,
he and his partners went to work developing the SuperTrust fund
``on Oct. 20.''
   The resulting fund would allow individual and institutional
investors to tailor their investments to different objectives.
Unlike portfolio insurance, SuperTrust would be collateralized by
underlying securities.
   ``This is an idea that has been around for some time in very
theoretical form,'' Leland said in an interview. ``The problem was
to engineer it to the point where we could bring it to the market.''
   SuperTrust is expected to be approved for listing by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in a few months. It will be
divided into two SuperUnits, one invested in stocks and the other
in interest-bearing securities.
   The underlying assumption is that when the stock market falls,
interest rates tend to move higher and vice versa.
   The stock SuperUnit will be a fund of the Standard &amp; Poors 500
index managed by Wells Fargo Investment Advisors. It will be
subdivided into two types of SuperShares _ Appreciation Shares that
would do best if the stock market soars and Index Income Shares
that would do best if the market rises only moderately.
   The other SuperUnit will be a money market fund invested in
short-term, high-grade securities, mainly Treasury bills. This
trust also will be split into Money Market Income Shares that would
do best in a flat market and Protection Shares that would do best
if the stock market falls.
   What SuperTrust doesn't do is eliminate the need for investors
to determine when to move from one fund to the other. There also
will be a charge for trading SuperShares, about 2.5 percent for
small accounts and 0.25 percent for large ones.
   Leland told analysts recently that SuperTrust's assets would
have to be large enough to provide liquidity for institutional
investors. He estimated the assets could reach $2 billion to $10
billion its first year.
   SuperTrust might confuse some small investors and retail brokers
initially, some analysts said, but it is already creating
excitement among institutional investors.
   ``I find it extremely fascinating,'' said Joel Damon, a vice
president at Bank of America who helps guide the investment of a
$850 million pension fund and $400 million savings plan. ``I think
it's a well thought out strategy, but it's too early to tell if our
pension fund can make use of these products.
   ``It doesn't help provide you with a crystal ball, but it does
provide you with alternatives to the futures and options market for
hedging your bet,'' he said.
   John Dolanm of Dolan Capital Management in Menlo Park, calls
SuperTrust ``sheer genius. It's going to change the way the world
thinks about investing.''
   Investors who lost money with portfolio insurance may avoid the
SuperTrust, Dolan said. ``But LOR won't necessarily be selling to
the same group of people. They'll be selling this to people who
weren't sophisticated enough to buy portfolio insurance. It's much
more straightforward. The potential market will be much higher.''

<HEAD>Steve Jobs Says Next Computer Will Be Sold Through Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After six months of saying it was only for
universities, Steve Jobs on Thursday offered the general public a
chance to buy his ``scholar's workstation'' through the nation's
top retailer of desktop computers to business.
   Jobs said university officials nationwide had encouraged him to
get his Next Computer System onto the retail market.
   ``They told us they think we've got a revolutionary product. But
they said we've got to get it out into a broader market so their
students will see it when they get into the workplace after
graduating,'' Jobs said at one of his typically glitzy news
conferences.
   With the announcement, Jobs _ often described as a guru of the
personal computer industry _ formally launched a race to capture a
major market share of a new generation of computers, machines that
could revolutionize the industry and redefine personal computing.
   Jobs, president of Next Inc. and co-founder of Apple Computer
Inc., confirmed at the news conference that a distribution deal had
been signed with Businessland Inc., which has 112 outlets and
annual sales last year of $1.2 billion.
   The agreement will give Jobs' Palo Alto-based company greater
visibility. It will also speed up development of software and deal
a blow to rival Sun Microsystems Inc., which had been negotiating
with Businessland and other resellers over the same distribution
rights.
   ``This deal is a major coup for both companies,'' said Jonathan
Seybold, a leading computer industry expert. ``It gives
Businessland an extremely attractive product ... and it gives Next
the premiere company for selling high-end computer desktop systems
to the public.
   ``I think the industry has been frankly just stunned by this
development, because now it's become clear Jobs is a serious
contender in the industry once again.''
   More than two dozen software developers also attended the news
conference, where they unveiled an array of programs that Jobs says
will make the Next an incomparable office, research and educational
tool.
   The Businessland deal was particularly important for software
developers because they view it as a move to put the machine into
wide circulation, thereby assuring a larger market for their
programs, which Next needs if it hopes to set industry standards
with its operating system and thereby establish itself as the
industry leader.
   Jobs announced software development was already under way at
several companies, including Adobe Systems Inc., Lotus Development
Corp. and Sybase Inc.
   The retail price of his machine is expected to be between
$10,000 and $12,000. There was no immediate announcement of price.
   Jobs claimed last fall that his Next computer initially would be
sold exclusively to educators and students at a discounted price of
$6,500. He said he would not venture immediately into the business
market.
   Bruce Lupatkin, analyst for Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. in San
Francisco, called that claim a ``smokescreen ... Anybody who is
awake would realize you couldn't build a big business in
workstations and avoid selling to the corporate and technical
market. I don't believe it is a shift in strategy; it's a shift in
tactics.''
   The worldwide market for general-purpose and technical
workstations _ high-powered desktop computers that range in cost
from $8,000 to $80,000 _ is estimated at $4 billion and growing
rapidly. Such machines give desktop users vastly improved abilities
over standard personal computers, particularly in visual displays,
speed and mathematical calculations.
   Next Inc.'s workstation is a sleek, black magnesium-boxed
computer which features an erasable optical disk drive that can
hold about 200,000 typewritten pages of information. It is Jobs'
first product since his 1985 ouster as chairman of Apple Computer
Inc., which he co-founded in the 1970s in a garage.

   President Bush today called the massive oil
spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound ``a major tragedy'' as his
administration ruled out as counterproductive a federal takeover of
cleanup operations.
   ``The cleanup will not be easy,'' Bush said. ``But, as with
other serious disasters, we must and will work together at all
levels, public and private, to remedy the damage that's been done
and then to safeguard the precious environment for the future.''
   Separately, Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost said it was
``almost unbelievable'' that the supertanker Exxon Valdez could
have gotten outside a 10-mile wide shipping lane to run aground
last Friday.
   ``Obviously something went very badly wrong,'' Yost told a White
House news briefing after he and two other senior federal officials
reported to Bush on their two-day fact-finding trip to the site of
the largest oil spill in U.S. history.
   The president referred to the accident in a speech to the
Association of Community and Junior Colleges.
   Departing from his prepared text, he called the 100-mile long
oil slick ``a subject of concern to all Americans today.''
   ``There's no doubt this is a major tragedy, both for the
environment and for the people up there,'' Bush said. He said the
report from the three officials ``was not all negative. But let's
be frank. There are some very serious problems up there right now.''
   ``This was not a treacherous area, not treacherous in the area
where they ran aground,'' Adm. Yost told reporters. ``It's 10 miles
wide. Your children could drive a tanker up through it.''
   Yost said allegations of ``alcohol use'' by the ship's captain
would be thoroughly investigated by the government.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said cleanup operations
were now being well coordinated. ``All of us are convinced that the
effort, after a somewhat slow start, is going at full speed,''
Skinner said.
   He said there was ``no need to federalize this effort'' and that
such a move ``might be counterproductive.'' Bush had initially
mentioned a federal takeover as one option.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly
called the spill, the nation's largest ever, ``obviously a disaster
of enormous magnitude.''
   He said ``it seems inevitable that there will be a very
substantial impact, particularly on the habitats of sea otters and
sea lions.''
   However, Reilly said, ``it's too soon to say in any conclusive
way what the impact on habitat or on the wildlife will be.''
   He said Bush had directed that environmental and wildlife
protection in the once-pristine sound be given ``top priority.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the officials
would continue to monitor the cleanup from Washington and would
report back in 30 days with ``broader recommendations,'' including
possible options for long-term action.
   Skinner said Exxon Corp. was making ``an all-out effort,'' but
that the federal government would make sure that the corporation
honored its commitments. He declined to criticize Exxon for its
current efforts but said its initial response ``could have been
quicker.''
   ``If we don't learn from this experience, we are just not
performing our job,'' Skinner said.
   He said most of the damage was done in the first few hours after
the 978-foot tanker ran around, spilling more than 10 million
gallons of crude oil into the once pristine sound.
   The transportation secretary said the tanker was moving at a
brisk 15 knots when it ran into the reef, well outside the regular
navigation channel.
   The three officials met with Bush for about 45 minutes, then
spoke with reporters in the White House briefing room.
   Skinner said Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper told the federal team
``that the effort is now going forward at the correct pace. Exxon,
the state and the federal government were working well together.''
   He said the prospect of a federal takeover of the cleanup ``will
be held in abeyance'' but was not a live option at this time.
   Reilly, the EPA administrator, said his agency would closely
monitor the environmental impact of the 500-square-mile spill.
   He said the officials did not see any direct evidence of impact
on wildlife in their helicopter tour over the oil-stained beaches.
But, he said, ``it has affected any number of coves and inlets.''
   The officials said that no decison has yet been made on a
request by the state to declare the sound a diaster area, but that
it is under consideration.
   One issue under review in the federal investigation, according
to James Kolstad, the acting head of the National Transportation
Safety Board, is why Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon
Valdez, had a license to operate the tanker at a time when he
didn't have a license to drive a car.
   Hazelwood's driver's license was suspended because of a drunken
driving conviction.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Collapse On Feelings Drought Is Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed sharply
lower across the board Thursday on speculation that the long dry
spell in the nation's heartland is drawing to a close.
   A night of heavier-than-expected rainfall in the drought-plagued
wheat fields of western Kansas kicked the selling into motion on
the Chicago Board of Trade and it simply snowballed, gathering
momentum as wave after wave of sell orders washed through the
markets.
   ``There's an old saying that rain begets rain,'' said Cathy
Leow, a grain-market analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
in New York.
   ``Watch out when a drought begins to break; it typically means
there'll be more rain,'' she said, noting forecasts for weekend
showers in the Great Plains and the Midwest.
   The selling also reflected a continued evening of positions
ahead of Friday afternoon's Agriculture Department quarterly grain
stocks report and spring planting estimates.
   At the close, wheat was 10 cents to 19} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.08{ a bushel; corn was 5{ cents

<HEAD>Milken Defense: Indictment Should Raise Storm Over RICO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indicting junk bond whiz Michael R. Milken on
racketeering charges could speed settlement of a wide-ranging
securities fraud case against his ex-bosses, but defense lawyers
call the racketeering attack an abuse of prosecutorial powers.
   A 98-count federal grand jury indictment claims the Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. financier, his brother and associate Bruce L.
Newberg schemed with former speculator Ivan Boesky and others to
defraud clients and investors through a range of securities laws
violations.
   The three face huge prison terms, forfeiture of $1.8 billion in
personal assets and total fines of more than $11 billion under the
federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act,
established in 1970 principally to combat organized crime but now
increasingly used to prosecute white-collar criminals.
   ``I think it is outrageous to use RICO in a circumstance like
this,'' said said Michael Armstrong, an attorney for Lowell Milken.
``They applied the statute to behavior which for the most part has
not been considered even to be criminal, much less the subject of a
racketeering indictment.''
   The indictment says Milken and the others made $244 million in
illegal fees and profits by cheating clients through insider
trading, stock manipulation and ``parking'' schemes that conceal
the true ownership of securities.
   Some of the alleged illegal trades were used in mergers or
takeovers and to control financial markets for personal gain, the
indictment says.
   Charges against Milken, 42, who almost single-handedly created
the present $175 billion high-yield bond industry, are expected to
help resolve separate civil and criminal charges against Drexel,
said one defense lawyer who asked not to be named.
   Negotiations between Drexel and the Securities and Exchange
Commission to settle civil fraud charges, including insider
trading, deadlocked earlier this month when the firm balked at a
requirement that it fire Milken before resolving the claims.
   With the indictment, Drexel placed Milken on leave from the
firm, apparently rendering the issue moot. Once the SEC settlement
is signed, Drexel is to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650
million to settle criminal fraud charges brought by the Justice
Department.
   At issue in each case is the use of racketeering statutes and
government power to obtain cooperation from defendants in the
prosecution of Drexel and Milken.
   Drexel has said publicly it agreed to settle the criminal
charges to avoid a racketeering indictment that could have frozen
its multibillion-dollar assets and crippled its operations.
   As part of the pact, the nation's fifth-largest brokerage house
agreed to fire Milken and withhold his 1988 pay, estimated at up to
$200 million.
   In the SEC deal, the government reportedly wants to bar Milken
from the firm for life and prohibit Drexel employees from talking
business with him.
   The 110-page indictment handed up Wednesday parallels last
September's SEC complaint and the government's racketeering
indictment of Princeton-Newport LP, a defunct investment
partnership, a month earlier. Newberg, a former Drexel trader, was
charged in the case, set for trial June 5.
   In that case, also cited in the Milken charges,
Princeton-Newport allegedly sold securities to Drexel to conceal
their ownership and claim losses for tax purposes. Parking isn't
illegal but the government is seeking to prove it violates
securities laws if conducted with fraudulent intent.
   Indictments of other Drexel employees are expected and the grand
jury investigating the firm still is calling witnesses. Defense
lawyers contend the Milken charges are aimed at pressuring other
potential defendants to cooperate and avoid charges.
   ``They shouldn't be using indictments as leverage in their
publicity campaigns and trying to induce people to talk,'' one
defense lawyer said.
   A major point of contention promises to be the government's
attempt to seize under the RICO law $3.7 billion from each of the
defendants _ twice the total amount of their salaries, stock
holdings and other compensation from 1984 through 1987, plus
interest.
   The indictment says Milken amassed more than $1 billion in the
four years, including $550 million in 1987 compensation, as head of
Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based junk bond division, partly due
to his relationship with Boesky.
   It maintains all money made by the men _ through illict trades
or not _ is tainted because it constitutes ``the proceeds of their
unlawful schemes and their interest in the racketeering enterprise
charged.'' Drexel is considered the racketeering enterprise and
Michael Milken its leader.

<HEAD>Fight Over Harrods' Ownership Flares Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bitter battle over ownership of the famous
Harrods department store broke out anew Thursday when Lonrho PLC
published a special edition of its newspaper The Observer,
detailing what it said was a government report on an investigation
into the matter.
   The government moved quickly to block the special edition, which
was devoted entirely to the long-running dispute between Lonrho and
the Egyptian Al-Fayed brothers. It obtained a high court order
against its distribution at midday Thursday.
   Paul Spicer, a Lonrho director, said the British conglomerate
probably would contest the injunction, claiming that it was in the
public interest to publish the report, which the government so far
has withheld.
   Mohamed Al-Fayed, who heads the retail chain House of Fraser
PLC, Harrods' owner, told British Broadcasting Corp. television,
``However much Tiny Rowland (Lonrho's managing director) abuses his
ownership of The Observer, he will never own Harrods.''
   Donald Trelford, editor of the weekly Observer, denied that the
newspaper was being used by its proprietor.
   The Egyptian Al-Fayed brothers purchased House of Fraser in 1985
for 615 million pounds ($1.03 billion) after Lonrho's repeated
attempts to buy it were thwarted by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
   Since then, Lonrho has waged a campaign against the Al-Fayeds to
have the takeover reversed.
   A Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into the Al-Fayeds'
ownership of House of Fraser began in April 1987 but the results
have not been published. The trade department says it has withheld
its report at the request of the Serious Fraud Office, which is
investigating the affair.
   Lonrho has repeatedly alleged that the Al-Fayeds made a series
of false representations about their wealth and their origins to
make their bid, allegations which the Al-Fayeds deny.
   The Observer, normally published on a Sunday, was due to be
issued at noon Thursday and included what it claimed were long
extracts from the Department of Trade and Industry report on the
matter.
   The Observer printed 250,000 copies, but 10 minutes before the
16-page paper was due to hit the streets, the trade department was
granted an injunction by High Court Justice Tudor Evans against
Lonrho and The Observer.
   The Department of Trade and Industry called American news
organizations, including The Associated Press, saying the
injunction applied to them.
   Lonrho Chairman Sir Edward du Cann told shareholders at their
annual meeting in London Thursday: ``I cannot understand ... why
the Department of Trade and Industry is continuing to try and hush
this up.''
   Trelford, The Observer's editor, defended the decision to
publish the special edition.
   ``It was my idea,'' Trelford told BBC television, adding that
the government report was a major scoop which couldn't wait until
the regular Sunday publication of the newspaper.
   The injunction did not prevent the special edition from getting
out. Lonrho distributed copies of it to its shareholders at their
meeting before the injunction was granted and afterward some
newsagents still were selling it.

<HEAD>Buyers Considered; Judge Hears Back-To-Work Arguments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge in Miami on Thursday considered whether to order
pilots back to work at strike-crippled Eastern Airlines, while the
board of the company's parent Texas Air Corp. met to mull buyout
plans for the airline.
   Eastern lawyers returned to court seeking to force pilots back
to work after almost four weeks of a strike, arguing that the
pilots union was illegally using the walkout to change its contract.
   But the pilots told U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis they
joined the Machinists on March 4 in a legal sympathy walkout
because they feared that Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo would
destroy both unions, as he had at Eastern's sister carrier
Continental Airlines in 1983.
   It was unclear when Davis would make a decision.
   In Houston, Texas Air's headquarters, its directors gathered for
what was expected to be a crucial meeting.
   They were considering a $500 million offer for Eastern from
outgoing Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, who has garnered
union support in recent days as one of two leading contenders for
the airline, sources close to the situation said.
   The status of a long-awaited bid for Eastern from the second
contender, takeover strategist and TWA owner Carl Icahn, wasn't
immediately clear.
   Developer Donald Trump, meanwhile, pressed ahead in negotiations
to buy Eastern's Northeast air shuttle, despite a possible
competing bid from America West Airlines of Phoenix.
   Trump agreed in October to buy the shuttle from Eastern for $365
million. But he told Texas Air last week that the strike against
Eastern had lowered the shuttle's value and that he would reduce
his offer by about $125 million.
   Texas Air countered by telling Trump it would look for other
buyers of the hourly service, which links New York with Boston and
Washington.
   Trump appeared willing to pay an amount close to his original
$365 million offer, but also is looking to increase the number of
planes included in the deal from 17 to 20 or 21, sources said.
   America West, the nation's 10th-largest carrier, recently
expressed interest in the Eastern shuttle, said the sources, who
requested anonymity.
   Under terms of the America West offer, current employees of
Eastern would be excluded from working for the shuttle after it was
sold to the Phoenix-based carrier, the sources said.
   Trump, on the other hand, has recognized Eastern's unions as
valid bargaining representatives for future shuttle employees. He
has said he plans to negotiate separate agreements with them.
   America West is mainly interested in the shuttle's landing slots
in the three cities and in purchasing Boeing 757s from Eastern to
augment its fleet, the sources said. Trump's agreement with Texas
Air calls for him to buy 17 smaller and older Boeing 727s, but the
sources noted that none of those planes are specifically attached
to the shuttle service.
   America West spokesman Dick Shimizu declined Thursday to comment
directly on the shuttle and reiterated the statement made by a
spokeswoman late Wednesday: ``America West has an interest in
certain assets or opportunities that might be available in the
Eastern situation.''
   Any offers for Eastern or its shuttle would have to be approved
by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, where Eastern filed for
protection from creditors on March 9.
   Neal Mann, the assistant U.S. trustee helping administer the
Eastern bankruptcy, said U.S. Trustee Harold Jones doesn't expect
to select an examiner in the case before Monday.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton Lifland recently ordered the
appointment of an examiner for Eastern with sweeping powers to
mediate the bitter dispute between the airline and its unions and
to review Eastern's finances.

<HEAD>Junk Bond Market Shrugs Off Milken Indictment; Competitors May Be
Drooling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A criminal indictment against the man who led
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond operations to the top of
the heap is considered unlikely to stir the multibillion-dollar
market in those securities, but some say it gives competitors an
added edge against the firm.
   Because the government's action against 42-year-old Michael
Milken had long been expected, ``nobody really cares,'' one trader
who spoke on condition of anonymity said Thursday.
   Prices of high-yield, low-rated bonds were little changed to
slightly higher in quiet dealing the day after a federal grand jury
indicted Milken and two others on 98 counts of racketeering and
fraud.
   Traders contacted seemed more interested to learn that Milken's
salary topped $1 billion between 1984 and 1987 than to ponder the
market impact of the charges.
   The nonchalant reaction was reminiscent of how the market
shrugged off news last December that Drexel agreed to admit guilt
to six felonies and pay a record $650 million fine to settle
sweeping government securities fraud charges unrelated to its junk
bond operations.
   It also seemed to indicate how the market for low-rated,
high-yield corporate debt securities, which Drexel almost
single-handedly expanded into a $180 billion industry, has become
an institution that can weather the storm.
   Under Milken's guidance, Drexel exploited the gigantic U.S.
corporate appetite for financing by using junk bonds _ so called
because they carry a greater risk of default than higher-grade
investment quality paper _ as a means of borrowing money to pay for
deals ranging from mergers and hostile takeovers to corporate
expansions.
   Junk bonds formerly were used primarily by borrowers with weak
credit ratings or scanty earning histories.
   Experts say Drexel has carved a niche so substantial that it
will continue doing well in the junk bond market.
   Last year, Drexel issued $11.59 billion in new junk bonds,
giving it 41 percent of that market, according to Securities Data
Co. Milken's department is believed to have generated more than
half of the firm's profits.
   There is lingering speculation that some Drexel clients who feel
particularly loyal to Milken will take their business elsewhere.
``They might feel Drexel treated him too harshly,'' one trader said.
   Under its settlement with the government, Drexel agreed to fire
Milken and deny him his 1988 bonus, although the firm continues to
pay Milken's legal fees. Drexel placed Milken on a leave of absence
following the indictment.
   Sources said some clients are establishing relationships with
other junk bond issuers as a hedge against possible future problems
involving Drexel.
   And those other players are out courting business.
   John Moran, a trader with Advest Inc., said a number of
investment firms have ``built up tremendously over the past six or
seven months. ... Anybody who wanted to compete with Drexel decided
to do that when the whole scandal broke'' more than two years ago.
   ``When the No. 1 people are in trouble, it gets the others
running in the door faster ... it gives (the others) an edge,'' he
said.
   In the 1989 first quarter, Drexel for the first time was
supplanted by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. as the No. 1 new junk-bond
underwriter.
   Drexel's $800 million in sales ranked fourth with a 16 percent
share of the market, down from $1.75 billion and a 43 percent share
in the year-ago quarter. Goldman Sachs' first-quarter share totaled
$1.25 billion, or 25 percent, according to figures from Securities
Data.
   Other major players in the junk bond market include Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and First
Boston Corp.
   But Drexel is likely to recapture its lead in the second
quarter. The firm has yet to repackage about $5 billion in junk
bonds that financed the mega-buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. Those
issues should be coming to market in the next few months.
   ``Other firms may have issues in the private market that
eventually will go public, but it's nothing like a $5 billion
deal,'' said Fran Wissak, an assistant vice president at Securities
Data.
   And there seems to be little concern that the market will have
anything but a healthy appetite for the Nabisco issue.
   ``They've already done their road show, and I understand they've
done a good job'' trying to generate interest in the issue among
investors, Wissak said.

   Assets of the nation's 461 money market mutual
funds rose $186.8 million to a new record of $299.62 billion in the
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   It was the 12th straight week the fund assets hit an all-time
high, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said.
   The group said that in the week ended Wednesday, assets of 228
general purpose funds rose $262.7 million to $97.68 billion, assets
of 94 broker-dealer funds decreased $113.4 million to $128.93
billion, and assets of 139 institutional funds rose $37.5 million
to $73.00 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 9.04 percent from 8.95 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.89 percent from 8.78 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
31 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.65 percent as of Wednesday from 6.53 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was 5.14 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.17
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 9.05 the
previous week. Yields were 9.38 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 9.25
percent; 9.29 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 9.19 percent; and
9.20 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 9.13 percent.

   Stock prices were mixed today, pausing after
their rally of the past three sessions.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that new factory
orders declined 2.3 percent in February.
   That provided fresh support for the view that the pace of the
economy began to slow last month.
   But analysts have been reluctant to conclude from a single
month's data that the Federal Reserve has succeeded in its efforts
to subdue inflationary pressures by tightening credit.
   The first indication of whether the slowing continued in March
will come in the Labor Department's monthly employment report late
next week.
   In the meantime, stocks got little support today from the bond
market, where interest rates rose slightly.

   It sounds like something from a Hollywood
script: An actor turned takeover strategist wrests control of a
movie company away from its founder.
   That's what Tim Matheson, better known as the philandering
frat-brother Otter in ``Animal House,'' has done with National
Lampoon Inc., which produced the 1978 hit film and publishes
National Lampoon magazine.
   Matheson and partner Daniel Grodnik don't see themselves in the
same vein as Carl Icahn or Ronald Perelman, the takeover
strategists who respectively bought Trans World Airlines and Revlon
Inc.
   ``We want to build a company,'' Grodni in an interview, with
Matheson chiming in: ``a significant entment company.''
   Yet the pair won National Lh some tried-and-true methods of
corporate acquisition _ perhaps because they were schooled by David
Batchelder, ex-adviser to another renowned takeover strategist, T.
Boone Pickens Jr.
   Matheson and Grodnik, an independent film producer, hankered for
their own movie company after they co-produced the film ``Blind
Fury.''
   They retained Batchelder, telling him they wanted to raise $50
million to form a production company.
   Buttchelder said it made more sense to buy an existing company
rat _ a lesson many corporate acquirers and entrepreneurs have
learned.
   Grodnik quoted Batche the pair, ``Just find a company that has
an operating history that you feel is undervalued inrketplace.''
   They settled on money-losing Nl Lampoon, whose stock price was
languishing at around $2.50 a
   Was it a coincidence they chose the producer of ``Animal House?''
   Not entirely. ``It l of our needs and purposes,'' Matheson said.
``It was the best company that we came up with.''
   With Batchr's help, Grodnik and Matheson persuaded nine National
Lampoon stockholders to assign the pair their voting rights. These
stockholders had bouat $7 or $8 a share, Grodnik said, and ``they
wanted some relief.''
   The agreements gave the pair control over 18.5 percent of the
stock, and a 3 percent stake they bought boosted the figure to 21.5
pe
   At that point, late last year, they approached National Lampoon
founder and chairman Matty Simmons and said they wanted to join the
company's management. Grodnik, Matheson and Simmons downplayed any
resemblance betw and a classic takeover fight.
   ``It wasn't ' Simmons said in an interview.
   But Matheson acknowledged that, ``It was a surprise (to Simmons)
that we ch over 21.5 percent of the voting stock,'' and that it
took some pressure to move the National n founder.
   ``It became very obvious to him that we're not g Matheson said,
adding that their voting stake ``became irresistible ... We had
this critical m of support.''
   Simmons may have balked at first, but he say, ``The idea came
from me of them buying my stoand taking over the management of the
company.'
   Simmons said he was tired of trying to run the movie producin
California and the magazine in New York, and wanted to concentrate
on filmmaking. So he soldercent stake March 16 to Grodnik and
Matheson at $6 a share, or corporate acquirers, the men who now
control National Lampoon must try to turne business around.
National Lampgazine, known for salacious humor after its founding
in 1970, has lost readers over the years.
   ``The company needs direction, money and management,''
Grodntheson and Grodnik admit they have little experience with
magazines, but with an injection of outside capital _ which
Batchelder will arrange _ they want to hire people who can revive
the magazine's former glory.
   ``The magazine's alnown as the cutting edge of comedy in
America,'' said Matheson, but ``the proper attention wasn't paid to
staythe cutting edge.''
   Would they sell the magazine or other National Lampoon assets?
   ``No way,'' said Matheson.
   ``We're not in here to do a Kohlberg Kravis Roberts we're going
to piece this thing apart and sell if off,'' he said, referring to
the investment firm that has financed multibillion dollar takeovers
partly through the sale of corporate assets.
   Grodnik said he expected that ``the movie company will
strengthen the magazine and the magazine will strengthen the movie
company.''
   Among the people working on movies for National Lampoon _ 11 are
in development _ is Matty Simmons.
   National Lampoon will continue mady films under its flagship
label, but Grodnik and Matheson als want to do more serious
pictures and action movies.
   ``We'll come up with our own version of the Touchstone label,''
said Matheson, referring to the Walt Disney Co. division that has
produced hits like ``Good Morning: Vietnam'' and ed Roger Rabbit.''
   Noting that they already have production experience, Matheson
and Grodnik sound confidl succeed.
   ``What we're doing here is not unlike any busineto try the
business end of movies _ Clint Eastwood and Michael Douglas are
producers _ and he rejects the suggactor may not be qualified to
run a business.
   , 41, started in the entertainment business 30 years ago as a
child actor in television. He appeared in ``Leave It to Beaver''
and was a regular on ``The Virginian,'' ``Bonanza'' and other shows.
   Besides ``Animal House,'' his movie credits include the Mel
Brooks film ``To Be Or Not To Be.''
   He turned to production with ``Blind Fury'' and last year did an
ABC comedy sies, ``Just in Time.'' He also starred in the t show _
playing a magazine publisher.
   Grodnik, 36, said he has always been an entrepreneur, starting
in childhood by selling soda and moving on to setting up high
school dances, ski trips and concerts.
   At the University of Southern California he studied film, and
found that producing a movie wasn't that different from putting on
a concert.
   Matheson and Grodnik met eight years ago, and began working on
the pro became ``Blind Fury.''
   ``We worked so well together,'' said Matheson. So tey made the
partnership permanent _ and started on the road that brought the
ack to National Lampoon.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. on Thursday announced the
latest move in a campaign to slim down and tighten up _ a
reorganization of its central merchandising operation that will cut
some 800 management jobs.
   The changes in the Sears Merchandise Group, which will close 24
regional administrative offices, are the latest in a series as the
nation's largest retailer tries to hold its own in a fast-moving,
highly competitive market.
   Since October, Chicago-based Sears has put its trademark Sears
Tower, the world's tallest building, up for sale, moved to offer
more brand-name products and shifted to everyday low pricing.
   Thursday's announcement calls for streamlining the merchandise
group, which is structured ``horizontally'' with an ever-widening
chain of commmand.
   The goal is creation of six crisp new operations, with direct
reporting and accountability from the retail store to the group
vice president _ in appliances-electronics, home fashions, home
improvement, women's apparel, men's-children's apparel and
automotive, the company said.
   ``I think what is necessary for Sears to be competitive ...
given the change in pricing structure ...is to reduce cost of the
operation and this a step in that direction,'' said analyst Joseph
Ronning with Brown Brothers Harriman Inc. in New York.
   ``Each of these businesses in Sears stores will report directly
to a district manager for that distinct business, who will be
accountable for customer service, sales and profits in 10 stores
and report to a region manager for that business,'' said Michael
Bozic, chairman and chief executive officer of Sears Merchandise
Group.
   ``The new structure will allow us to better execute the
strategies that will make us more competitive and more
profitable,'' Bozic said.
   The reorganization ``takes away the old structure and makes a
leaner company, one that has more room for profit improvement,''
said analyst Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
   The merchandise group's restructuring, effective Aug. 1, will
eliminate numerous field offices, including the 24 regional
administrative offices that oversee Sears' 824 stores under the
current system. Ten regional locations will be retained to provide
support to retail store operations.
   The new field operation will operate with about 800 fewer
management positions than the current system, with 7,700 such jobs,
the company said.
   No layoffs are anticipated, said Sears spokesman Ernest Arms,
citing attrition and reorganization incentives that include a
salary continuation plan and early retirement benefits.
   A similar restructuring of a Sears headquarters organization is
under way on a department-by-department basis, Bozic said, and is
to be completed this year.
   Speculation about the sale of the 110-story Sears Tower
continued Thursday, with reports that Sears had moved back its
schedule and was seeking a sale in four years instead of two.
   But Arms said the two-year timetable had been just an example in
documents for perspective buyers.
   ``We're not being coy _ we just don't know.'' he said. ``First
we've got to determine where it is we're going.''
   All but 600 of the 7,400 Sears workers in the tower are to be
relocated, and the company is being wooed by several states though
``we've expressed the desire to remain in the Chicago area,'' Arms
said.
   Sears' prospectus does not mention a price. The Wall Street
Journal quoted unidentified industry sources Thursday as saying
Sears is asking $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion _ the most ever asked
for a U.S. office building.

<HEAD>Jobs Jumps Back Into Commercial Computer Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steve Jobs jumped back into the commercial
computer market on Thursday by announcing that his fast,
high-powered Next workstation will be sold at retail stores
nationwide.
   ``We've found that this machine is going to be the computer for
the 1990s,'' said David Norman, president of Businessland Inc.,
which will exclusively distribute the Next Computer System at its
112 outlets.
   Businessland, which had $1.2 billion in sales last year, is the
nation's biggest retailer for desktop computers for businesses.
Industry members characterized the deal as a major coup for Jobs'
3-year-old company, founded after he was ousted as president of
Apple Computer Inc. in 1985.
   ``In one fell swoop, Jobs has come up with a clean,
high-quality, professional distribution network that is the envy of
everyone. At the very least, it's a nice first move for a new
company,'' said Wood Lotz, president of Michigan-based Absoft,
which also unveiled its Next-compatible software.
   The computer system _ which includes an erasable optical-disk
drive with storage compacity for 200,000 typewritten pages _ will
sell for $9,995. It was offered to universities for $6,500.
   Since unveiling the sleek computer in a black-magnesium case six
months ago, Jobs has maintained he would sell initially only to
universities.
   But at a glitzy news conference on an enclosed pier on San
Francisco Bay, Jobs said school officials across the country
encouraged him to get his system onto the retail market nearly a
year earlier than he had planned.
   ``They told us they think we've got a revolutionary product, but
they said we've got to get it out into a broader market so their
students will see it when they get into the workplace after
graduating,'' Jobs said.
   The worldwide market for general purpose and technical
workstations _ high-powered desktop computers that range in cost
from $8,000 to $80,000 _ is estimated at $4 billion and growing
rapidly. Such machines give desktop users vastly improved abilities
over standard personal computers, particularly in visual displays,
speed and mathematical calculations.
   The market is expected to reach $20 billion by the early 1990s,
and major semiconductor and computer manufacturers are jockeying
for a share.
   Analysts say Jobs' move is a big step toward carving out a major
role for his company in the field of computers that use American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Unix operating system software.
   Jobs predicted the Next's Unix-based operating system will
become standard in the industry because of its speed, power and
versatility.
   Analysts hailed the Businessland deal for giving Jobs' Palo
Alto-based company greater visibility, speeding up development of
software and dealing a blow to rival Sun Microsystems Inc., which
also had been negotiating for distribution with Businessland.
   ``Next is now openly competing against players in the broad
desktop marketplace, and I believe for that market they've created
a machine that is extremely attractive,'' said Jonathan Seybold, a
leading industry expert.
   In response to some criticism there is comparatively little
software available for the Next, Seybold said that should be
expected from a machine on the leading edge of technology.
   Jobs also announced software development is already under way at
several companies, including Adobe Systems Inc., Lotus Development
Corp. and Sybase Inc. Some 15 other companies demonstrated programs
already written for the Next after the news conference.
   The Next is Jobs' first product since he left Apple Computer
Inc., which he co-founded in the 1970s in a garage.
   Over the last three months, Jobs said 1,000 computers have been
shipped from Next's fully robotic factory in Fremont, Calif., to
more than 60 of the country's major universities.
   Next also has trained more than 200 software writers on its
operating system, Jobs said.

<HEAD>Soviets, U.S. Consortium Sign Agreement On Rules For Joint Ventures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of U.S. corporations on Thursday signed a wide-ranging
agreement with the Soviet Union setting the framework for new joint
ventures worth up to $10 billion over 20 years.
   The group, calling itself the American Trade Consortium, has
been negotiating for a year to complete the deal with the Soviet
Foreign Economic Consortium, which establishes a legal and business
framework for the development of joint ventures between the groups.
   The U.S. consortium consists of giant food processer Archer
Daniels Midland Co.; Chevron Corp.; Eastman Kodak Co.; personal
products maker Johnson & Johnson; RJR Nabisco Inc., and the
Mercator Corp., a banking concern.
   Some of the possible joint ventures that now will be negotiated
include oilseed processing; manufacture of computer discs;
production of crackers, cereals, tobacco products and sweeteners;
and oil and gas exploration.
   But although at least one member of the ATC indicated it was
moving ahead with talks to set up joint ventures, several major
hurdles remain.
   Additionally, one original member of the group, Ford Motor Co.,
dropped out of the consortium saying there had not been enough
progress to warrant its continued participation.
   A significant issue is the repatriation of profits from the
Soviet Union, which has been a key obstacle in previous attempts by
Western companies to do business there. The Soviet ruble is not
convertible, and any profits earned in rubles are worthless outside
the country.
   James H. Giffen, president of the American group, said in an
announcement from Moscow that Thursday's agreement resolves that
issue in principle, but he declined to provide details.
   Feasibility studies will be conducted over the next year and
Giffen said the first of some 25 joint ventures could strt up
within 18 months.
   Kodak indicated it was negotiating seven joint ventures to
market cameras, film and other photographic products and to process
photographic film. Other ventures would sell computer discs and a
blood analyzer.
   Ford had planned to begin selling West German-made Scorpio
automobiles in the Soviet Union by the end of this year. Later, the
company hoped to begin an automobile manufacturing project in the
Soviet city of Gorky, where the Gorky Auto Works is making cars in
a plant built with Ford's help in the 1920s.
   ``Although there was progress, the framework of understandings
reached so far between the ATC and the Soviets was not sufficient
to make feasible a project of the scope and complexity of Ford's,''
said Philip Benton, president of Ford's automotive group,
   Ford spokesman Al Chambers declined to say how much money Ford
had spent on the project.
   ``At a later date, when the environment for doing business in
the USSR is better defined, it may be possible to complete such a
major project,'' Benton said in a prepared statement released in
Detroit. ``In those circumstances, we would certainly welcome the
opportunity to participate.''

   The stock market turned in an indecisive showing
Thursday, pausing after its rally of the past three sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 38.48 points in the
week's first three trading days, slipped back .18 to 2,281.34.
   But advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 726 up, 716
down and 498 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 159.95 million
shares, up from 144.24 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 188.41 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday morning that new
factory orders declined 2.3 percent in February.
   That provided fresh support for the view that the pace of the
economy began to slow last month.
   But analysts have been reluctant to conclude from a single
month's data that the Federal Reserve has succeeded in its efforts
to subdue inflationary pressures by tightening credit.
   The first indication of whether the slowing continued in March
isn't expected to come until the Labor Department's monthly
employment report late next week.
   In the meantime, stocks got little support from the bond market,
where interest rates rose slightly.
   Money-center bank stocks were strong for the second straight
session, apparently benefiting from increased confidence among
institutional money managers about their prospects for weathering
Third World debt problems.
   Citicorp climbed 1 to 29{; Bankamerica | to 24{; Chase Manhattan
1] to 37; Chemical Banking 1} to 35], and J.P. Morgan 1 to 39\.
   Illinois Power led the active list, down 1} at 14 on turnover of
more than 4.3 million shares. The Illinois Commerce Commission
granted a much smaller rate increase than the company had sought.
   Genentech dropped 1| to 17}. An article in the New England
Journal of Medicine reported on a study suggesting that the
company's clot-dissolving drug for treatment of heart attacks is no
more effective than a much less expensive alternative drug.
   Smithkline Beckman, which markets the alternative drug, rose ~
to 55|. Smithkline also has been the subject lately of takeover
rumors and speculation.
   Sears Roebuck rose { to 43{. The company announced plans for a
major revamping of its organizational structure.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.49 billion, or 0.12
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .13 to 164.38.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost .06 to 336.86, while
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up .17 at 292.52.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained .86 to 404.56. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 325.47, down .11.

<HEAD>Kansas Rain Triggers Flood Of Selling In Grain Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Widespread showers brought relief to Kansas wheat fields and
triggered a flood of selling Thursday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, where wheat futures prices settled at a 3{ month low.
   Other grain and soybean futures also fell sharply in Chicago
amid perceptions of improving growing conditions.
   On other markets Thursday, oil futures soared while gold,
silver, copper, livestock and meat futures all finished lower.
   Wheat settled 10 cents to 19\ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.09 a bushel, the lowest settlement price for
a near-month wheat contract since Dec. 16. Corn was 5} cents to 9\
cents lower with May at $2.65 a bushel; oats were 6{ cents to 8
cents lower with May at $1.89 a bushel; and soybeans were 16 cents
to 26{ cents lower with May at $7.37 a bushel.
   The rain that fell Wednesday night and early Thursday in western
Kansas was not remarkably heavy _ about { inch overall _ but it was
heavier and more widespread than expected, touching areas where
extreme dryness has caused irreparable harm to the winter wheat
crop.
   ``There's an old saying that rain begets rain,'' said Cathy
Leow, a grain-market analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
in New York.
   ``Watch out when a drought begins to break; it typically means
there'll be more rain,'' she said, noting forecasts for weekend
showers in the Great Plains and the Midwest.
   The Midwest, heart of the nation's corn and soybean country, has
also received welcome showers this week, which contributed to the
sell-off. The advancing South American soybean harvest, which is
bringing new supplies to the marketplace, added to the bearish tone.
   Observers said the selling also reflected continued
position-evening before Friday afternoon's Agriculture Department
quarterly grain stocks report and spring planting estimates.
   Few traders are willing to go out on a limb ahead of the
reports, which could have a huge impact on prices.
   ``There's a good chance there'll be some surprises'' in the
reports, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Crude-oil futures skyrocketed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as major oil companies coped with a supply squeeze in the
wake of a giant oil spill off the Alaskan coast.
   Exxon Corp. and British Petroleum Co.'s BP America unit each
announced they were scaling back on deliveries of Alaskan North
Slope crude to their customers receiving that type of oil.
   Meanwhile, OPEC ministers winding up a 2-day strategy session in
Vienna indicated cartel members planned to stick to their current
production restraints through mid-year, which added another bullish
factor to Thursday's trading.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 61 cents
higher with May at $20.81 a barrel; heating oil was 1.56 cents to
1.99 cents higher with April at 56.18 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was 1.35 cents to 3.01 cents higher with April at 63.19
cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures slipped lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange on signs of a continued easing of inflationary pressures.
   Gold settled $1.30 to $1.60 lower with April at $382.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.3 cents to 4.3 cents lower with May at $5.78 an
ounce.
   Copper futures prices dropped sharply on the Commodity Exchange,
reflecting increasing supplies.
   Copper settled 2.4 cents to 5.1 cents lower with April at $1.324
a pound.
   Weakening cash markets and bearish chart signals prompted heavy
selling of pork futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the
selling spilled over into the cattle pits.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent to .65 cent lower with April at
78.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .38 cent lower
with April at 81.40 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .80
cent lower with April at 40.87 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .15 cent to .80 cent lower with May at 38.07 cents a pound.

   MCI Communications Corp. said Thursday it will
reduce its long-distance rates by $200 million annually beginning
April 1 in response to federally ordered cuts in the charges it
pays to connect with local phone systems.
   The reductions will apply to residential and business customers
and could amount to cuts of as much as 12 percent for some callers,
the company said.
   The Federal Communications Commission has ordered the nation's
local phone companies to reduce their interstate calling access
charges by $705 million on April 1. The local companies charge
long-distance companies to help maintain the local phone systems.
   Since the breakup of the Bell system in 1984, the FCC has
ordered a series of reductions in the charges local phone companies
levy on long-distance companies. At the same time, it has required
the long-distance carriers to pass along the savings to their
customers.
   ``With this reduction, MCI will have dropped its rates more than
40 percent'' since 1984, MCI said.
   The $200 million reduction is subject to FCC approval.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls on Fed Intervention</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished lower Thursday as the
Federal Reserve stormed into the foreign exchange market, selling
dollars to squelch the currency's rally.
   Gold prices slipped in New York after rising overseas. Republic
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $381.55 for a troy
ounce of gold, down slightly from Wednesday's late bid of $381.80.
   The dollar advanced in early trading in response to rising oil
prices, said Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co. Inc.
   The Fed entered the market several times, selling small amounts
of dollars, but the U.S. currency continued its climb.
   However, in mid-afternoon, with the dollar at a peak for the day
of about 134.50 Japanese yen, the Fed made what Barbanel called ``a
massive intervention,'' selling dollars for West German marks and
Japanese yen.
   ``The Fed, when they really mean what they say, intervenes in
stages that over time become more sizable,'' said Barbanel.
   West German and Japanese officials ``don't want to see the
dollar gaining any more strength'' and the Fed acted in response to
those countries' wishes, Barbanel said.
   Traders took the hint, and sold the dollar down against other
currencies as well.
   The dollar ended the day in New York falling to 1.8910 West
German marks from late Wednesday's 1.8934 marks. It slipped to
132.00 Japanese yen from Wednesday's 133.115 yen.
   What the dollar does next depends on whether the intervention
continues Friday, Barbanel said.
   However, another factor that could affect the currency markets
is a possible hike in the Japanese discount rate, which was rumored
to be in the offing, Barbanel said.
   A hike in the key Japanese interest rate would likely be
followed by increases in West German and British rates. That would
boost those currencies and cause the dollar to decline.
   Overseas dealers described Thursday's trading as nervous
following intervention by central banks over several days.
   ``There's very little going on. People don't know what they want
to do,'' said one dealer at a West German bank.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6875 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's $1.6870. In New York trading,
the pound rose to $1.6888 from late Wednesday's $1.6875.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6490 Swiss francs, down from
1.65125; 6.3855 French francs, down from 6.3905; 1,385.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,389.00; and 1.19345 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19415.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.8885 West German marks, down
from 1.8910; 1.6475 Swiss francs, down from 1.6490; 6.3750 French
francs, down from 6.3800; 2.1296 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1315;
1,383.25 Italian lire, down from 1,385.65; and 1.1925 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1935.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 132.80 Japanese yen, down
from 133.25 yen. In later London trading the dollar was quoted at
132.30 yen.
   Gold fell $1.30 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, closing at $382.20.
   The late bid price for gold in London was $383.25 a troy ounce,
up from $382.75. The late bid price in Zurich was $383.40, up from
$381.75.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $384.45 bid, up from
$383.55.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.79 bid a troy ounce,
up from $5.78. But silver slipped 2.3 cents an ounce on the Comex
in New York, falling to $5.735.

<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended March 20, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,085.3 billion from $3,077.8 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$3,965.1 billion from $3,951.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $786.8 billion from $784.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of
3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,071.1 billion, a 2.5
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,965.1 billion, up 4.1 percent, while M1
rose 0.2 percent to an average of $787.3 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell to $57.3
billion, compared with of $57.6 billion a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $491 million a day,
up from $385 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $339
million, down from $383 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $289.7 billion in the two-week period ended
March 22, up from $285.9 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>GM Joins Ford In 2.9 Percent Financing; No Word on Chrysler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. on Thursday announced a
buyer incentive package featuring 2.9 percent financing and cash
rebates, a day after Ford Motor Co. began offering a similar
program.
   Like Ford, GM indicated the new package was mandated partly by
the recent rise in other kinds of interest rates _ including
adjustable rate home mortgages _ that have slowed consumer spending
on big ticket items such as cars and trucks.
   Chrysler Corp., which has a program featuring 4.9 percent
financing on some auto loans, did not immediately indicate it would
match the cut-rate deals.
   In addition to 2.9 percent financing, which is good only on
two-year loans, GM said it was offering cash rebates ranging from
$300 to $1,500, depending on model. Ford's rebates range from $300
to $4,000 per vehicle.
   The incentive programs offered by each of the Big Three have
sliding scales for low-interest financing, with rates decreasing
for shorter-term loans. rate. Ford and GM offer 9.9 percent
financing on five-year loans while Chrysler's package calls for a
10.9 percent rate on a 60-month loan.
   GM's new incentives take effect Friday and expire June 5. Ford's
new program took effect Wednesday and is to end May 31. Chrysler's
current program runs indefinitely.
   The move toward lower financing rates comes as the automakers
watch early 1989 sales fall below expectations. Through March 20,
this year's vehicle sales by the eight companies making cars in
North America were running 5.4 percent behind last year's pace.
   Monthly sales figures for March are due out next week.
   On Wednesday, Ford lowered its 1989 sales forecast to about 15
million cars and light trucks, down from a 15.4 million vehicle
estimate made less than two months ago.
   At the same time, production by the nation's Big Three
automakers have been keeping up with ambitious schedules and
inventories of unsold vehicles have been hovering around the 80-day
level.
   One way to trim large inventories is to offer incentives,
although manufacturers pay for such programs out of their own
profits. The prospect that automakers will have to offer bigger and
bigger incentives to buyers has some analysts raising the prospect
that earnings reports for the first half of this year could be
lower than initially expected.
   Ford and GM also were attempting to use their new incentives to
encourage buyers to take shorter term loans. Both automakers have
dropped their rate on fourt-year loans to 6.9 percent from 8.9
percent.
   About half of the loans written by Big Three automakers have
five-year terms, which have contributed to an increasing rate of
loan defaults and repossessions.

<HEAD>Manville To Sell Holophane Division For $102 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. announced Thursday it plans to sell
its Holophane Lighting systems division for $102 million to the Los
Angeles-based merchant banking firm Raebarn Corp.
   The Newark, Ohio-based division was put up for sale by Manville
in November.
   ``We're trying to focus on our core businesses and get rid of
businesses that are more on the fringe,'' said Manville spokeswoman
Tricia Bergeron.
   Holophane, which makes lighting fixtures and accessories for
commercial and industrial use, has been part of Manville's
Specialty Products Group, one of three groups of businesses
operated by the Denver-based manufacturer.
   The other groups are fiber glass and forest products. Specialty
products focuses on minerals businesses, Bergeron said.
   Holophane employs a total of 1,000 people at its eight plants,
located in Edison, N.J.; Newark, Pataskala, Utica and Springfield,
Ohio; Brampton, Ontario; St. Hyacinthe, Quebec; and Milton Keynes,
England.
   Bergeron said Raebarn intends to operate Holophane with the same
management and workforce.
   ``That was an important part of the negotiations,'' she said.
   Alfred B. Gough, Specialty Products Group president, said the
sale was expected to close within three months.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
350,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery in the 1988-89
marketing year that began on Sept. 1, the third purchase this week,
the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Orders totaling 1 million tons of corn were reported earlier.
Moscow has been buying U.S. wheat regularly under an export subsidy
program, but this week's sales are the first significant corn
purchases since Jan. 4.
   The corn, which is not subsidized under the export program, is
scheduled for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the sixth year of a
long-term grain supply agreement between the Soviet Union and the
United States.
   Officials said the latest sales brought total corn sold to the
Soviets for 1988-89 to more than 11.5 million tons. Additionally,
sales include 4 million tons of wheat, 450,000 tons of soybeans,
1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 350,000 tons of
corn would be about 13.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.58 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $36 million.

<TEXT>
   Import restrictions on British swine and pork
products are bring reduced as a result of Britain's eradication of
hog cholera, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The disease, which is highly contagious and often fatal to
swine, does not affect humans. The United States was declared free
of hog cholera in 1978 following a 15-year eradication program.
   Swine and uncooked pork products from Britain have been banned
from U.S. entry since April 11, 1986.
   Larry B. Slagle, acting administrator of the department's Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, said hog cholera has not been
reported in Britain since August 1987.
   The rule change, effective immediately, will affect some U.S.
swine producers who have expressed an interest in obtaining
breeding stock, swine semen or both from Britain, he said. However,
such imports are not expected to have a large impact on U.S. swine
producers, Slagle added.
   Small quantities of untreated pork and pork products from
Britain that are for personal consumption will be allowed to enter
the United States, he said. However, commercial shipments may
originate only from pork processing plants that meet U.S.
requirements.

<HEAD>UMW Leader Says Union Will Strike Pittston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTHA BRYSON HODEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CASTLEWOOD, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers renewed a strike
threat Thursday against the Pittston Co., saying little was
accomplished in a 60-day cooling off period requested by three
states where the coal company operates.
   ``Because of all the unfair labor practices Pittston has
created, because they have flouted the law, we will cease work at
the Pittston operations in the very near future,'' UMW President
Richard Trumka told a news conference at the union's Virginia
headquarters here.
   ``It will do you no good to ask me the precise time or date,''
Trumka said, declining to reveal specific strike plans.
   The UMW lifted a Feb. 1 strike deadline after the governors of
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky requested the cooling off
period. The strike would affect about 1,700 miners working at
Pittston operations in those three states. ``The governors asked us
to continue to negotiate for 30 to 60 days,'' Trumka said. ``We
complied, although we weren't really hopeful there'd be a change in
(their) attitude.''
   ``We saw little change,'' Trumka said. ``We've walked far more
miles than we probably should have.''
   The miners have been working without a contract since Feb. 1,
1988, when the 1984 national coal contract expired. Pittston, which
had earlier withdrawn from the nationwide industry bargaining
organization, refused to sign the new contract.
   Pittston President Michael Odom called the union's decision
unfortunate.
   ``The (Pittston) companies, however, remain committed to
fulfilling our contractual commitments to our customers,'' Odom
said. ``We intend to operate our mines in a safe and efficient
manner during the strike and, if necessary, will begin hiring
replacement workers as soon as the union strikes.''
   Trumka's announcement came a week after the National Labor
RelationsBoard regional office in Cincinnati told both sides it
believed there was cause to file an unfair labor practice complaint
against Pittston.
   The Pittston Co. is based in Greenwich Conn. It has interests in
bituminous coal mining, air freight forwarding and security
transportation services.

<HEAD>OPEC Panel Say Cartel Will Stick To Production Restraints In Late
1989</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 8th graf In futures... to UPDATE with closing WTI price.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers winding up a two-day
strategy session Thursday indicated cartel members planned to stick
to their current production restraints through mid-year but said
there were proposals to loosen the curbs later.
   Subroto, secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, said the meeting of the cartel's eight-member
monitoring committee was held in a ``very frank, good atmosphere''
but declined to provide details.
   The ministers, he said, renewed their intention to ``adhere very
strictly'' in the April-June quarter to last November's agreement
that called for production curbs in order to raise sagging crude
prices.
   Prices since then have risen by more than $5 a barrel for OPEC
crudes and before the meetings there were indications some
ministers wanted to consider raising the production limit for the
second half of 1989 to keep prices from rising too sharply.
   Iraq's oil minister Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, when asked by
reporters if he expected OPEC to raise its output limits, said
``Well, this is one of the proposals that has been put forward.''
He declined to elaborate.
   The meeting was the organization's first formal review of the
oil market since the accord, which covers the first six months of
the year.
   The supply cuts _ combined with greater demand and accidents in
producing areas _ have driven the price of a basket of OPEC crudes
to the cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   In futures trading, the May contract for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed up 61 cents Thursday
at $20.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That level
is more than $7 higher than the two-year lows reached last October.
   Crude prices were boosted somewhat Thursday by indications there
could be further supply problems stemming from the major oil spill
at Valdez, Alaska.
   Analysts say most of the 13 OPEC nations have curtailed
production to try to meet the cartel's daily output cap of 18.5
million barrels in the first six months of the year.
   The key violator, analysts say, has been the United Arab
Emirates.
   But Subroto announced that Abu Dhabi, which accounts for about
two-thirds of UAE production, planned to limit output to 850,000
barrels a day in March. It has been producing an estimated 1
million barrels daily, compared with its quota of 988,000 barrels.
   The promise, he said, ``is a good sign of the willingness of
everybody to adhere to the agreement.''
   OPEC says 12 nations supplied 17.4 million barrels of oil a day
to the world market in February, compared with the ceiling of 17.51
million barrels for the dozen.
   The United Arab Emirates was not included because it did not
supply figures to the cartel.
   Subroto said the ministers discussed a variety of topics
covering short-term and long-term issues confronting the oil market.
   This weeks talks laid groundwork for OPEC's June meeting, when
ministers will discuss an accord for the second half of this year.
   Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, suggested in
a recent interview that the cartel should boost its production cap
1.5 million barrels a day to a total of 20 million barrels in the
last six months of the year.
   But other ministers have said they wanted to see how prices
perform in the second quarter, normally weaker than the
January-March period with the coming of warmer weather in oil
importing nations.
   Subroto said, ``Demand for oil in the second half (of 1989) will
be increasing.''
   Subroto said the ministers would have ``many contacts with each
other'' before June, but he said there was no decision to convene
the monitoring committee before then.
   Before Thursday's formal talks, the ministers met privately in
their rooms at a luxury hotel.
   Independent oil exporting nations have agreed to help OPEC in
the second quarter by snipping their exports a total of about
300,000 barrels a day.
   Members of the monitoring committee are Algeria, Indonesia,
Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
   Other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates.

   Federal milk price supports will be
temporarily increased for three months beginning April 1 to $11.10
per 100 pounds from $10.60, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
said Thursday.
   The increase was required by last year's Disaster Assistance
Act. Milk price supports are carried out by the Agriculture
Department's purchase of butter, cheese and non-fat dry milk to
bolster the market price of milk paid to farmers.
   Because of current market conditions, Yeutter said the
department's Commodity Credit Corp. will boost its purchase price
for non-fat dry milk to 79 cents per pound, an increase of 6.25
cents.
   The CCC's butter price will be unchanged at $1.32 per pound,
while the purchase price of cheddar and barrel cheese will be
increase by 5 cents per pound to slightly more than $1.20 per pound.

<HEAD>Kroger Says Ready To Proceed With Shareholders' Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Kroger Co. said Thursday that if there are
no more objections, it will proceed with a court-approved
settlement of a class-action suit by shareholders who challenged
the $4.6 billion restructuring the company announced last September.
   Under the settlement, the Cincinnati-based grocery company will
pay $1.275 million in attorneys' fees to about 20 law firms around
the nation which represented the suit's plaintiffs.
   Kroger also agreed in the settlement to make changes in the way
employee shares are voted in its worker benefit and compensation
plans, and to amend terms of debentures it issued to about 60,000
shareholders as part of the restructuring.
   The changes include shortening the maturity date by two years,
altering procedures for redeeming the debentures and providing
procedures in which employees can vote their shares in benefit
plans confidentially.
   Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge William Mathews conducted a
hearing earlier this month to allow lawyers for Kroger and the
shareholders to comment on the settlement, which was proposed Jan.
24. Mathews approved the settlement Tuesday and Kroger announced
its details Thursday.
   Anyone who wants to appeal Mathews' ruling must do so within 30
days.
   Cincinnati lawyer Gene Mesh, who represented several dissident
stockholders who objected to the settlement, was out of his office
Thursday when a telephone call was placed to ask whether he would
file an appeal.
   Kroger, which operates supermarkets and convenience stores in
much of the nation, began the restructuring in part to fend off
takeover bids last fall by Dart Group Inc. of Landover, Md., and by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. of New York City. Kroger defeated the
takeover bids, but has since sold assets including some stores and
food processing plants, and laid off 300 of its 800 headquarters
employees last October.

<HEAD>Baker Calls Reform of Latin Economies Vital to Ease Debt Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds last 3 grafs with announcement on insurance fund. Also
moving on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As officials from 151 nations began arriving
for pivotal discussions on Third World debt, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III warned Latin American leaders Thursday that they
must make economic reforms to participate in the administration's
new debt reduction program.
   Baker said the Bush administration stood ready to negotiate
debt-reduction packages on a case-by-case basis as long as the
debtor countries accepted responsibility to make payments on their
reduced debt and to make internal reforms.
   Baker, a former Treasury secretary who crafted the debt approach
followed by the Reagan administration, said that there was no
``magic solution'' to the $1.2 trillion debt crisis which has left
developing nations facing mounting problems of economic and
political unrest.
   ``Democratic governments must try to reform bloated
state-dominated economies, service their debt and satisfy the real
needs of their citizens,'' Baker said in Atlanta at a conference on
Latin America hosted by former Presidents Carter and Ford.
   ``We understand that facing this challenge alone is a nearly
impossible juggling act,'' Baker told the gathering. It included
the president of Venezuela, a nation where 270 persons were killed
in rioting last month sparked by a new austerity program
implemented to please that nation's creditors.
   ``As you move forward to take the necessary but difficult steps
to restructure and reform your economies, we must be prepared to
hear your calls for help,'' said Baker. He urged a ``new bond of
cooperation and mutual responsibility'' between the United States
and the countries of Latin America.
   Baker's comments came as the administration stepped up efforts
to sell its new debt reduction proposals, which were unveiled on
March 10 by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   The administration's plan will come under global scrutiny at
meetings beginning Friday of the 151-nation International Monetary
Fund and its sister lending organization, the World Bank.
   Both of the large lending organizations have a role to play in
the new initiative, which is being called the Brady plan, and the
administration is hoping to get general approval of the new policy
approach by the time the sessions end next Tuesday.
   Under the new plan, commercial banks would be asked to forgive
voluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to poor nations.
In return, the IMF and World Bank would provide assurances that the
remaining debt would be repaid.
   The administration has estimated that over the next three years
its proposals could result in wiping out about $70 billion of the
$340 billion in debt owed by 39 developing nations, a group which
includes all of the largest debtors and many of the smaller ones.
   The debt strategy represents a major about-face for the United
States, which under the Baker plan rejected all proposals for
broad-based debt forgiveness and instead emphasized obtaining new
lending for poor nations.
   While not admitting that his approach had failed to generate the
hoped-for new loans to spur growth, Baker said, ``Clearly, Latin
America must begin to grow again and the fruits of that growth must
be more widely shared.''
   At the White House, officials announced that Venezuela's
President Carlos Andres Perez and El Salvador's President Alfredo
Cristiani, both newly elected, would meet with President Bush in
the next week.
   Perez, who has taken a leadership role in the Latin American
debt crisis, said at the Atlanta conference that the
administration's new debt plan offered hope for the region's
troubled democracies, which he said were facing ``unsustainable
pressures'' from the debt burden they are now carrying.
   In a speech in his own country on Wednesday, Perez had been more
blunt, blaming the price riots which broke out on Feb. 27 on
``intolerable and obscene'' debt repayment terms and warning that
those riots could be repeated in any of the countries of Latin
America.
   Perez, who accompanied Baker back to Washington, was scheduled
to meet Bush on Saturday at a breakfast session to be attended by
Baker, Brady and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Officials of both Venezuela and Mexico have been engaged in
intensive talks with U.S. Treasury officials in the past several
days. It is expected that those two nations will be the first to
qualify for debt relief under the Brady plan.
   Meanwhile, officials said that the IMF and World Bank were close
to resolving a turf battle between the two organizations that has
hampered their efforts to aid poor countries.
   An official of the World Bank, who spoke on condition that he
not be identified by name, said that the IMF board had already
reviewed the proposal and the matter was pending before the
directors of the World Bank.
   The agreement follows principles set out by a committee of
senior finance officials of the 10 leading industrial countries and
delineates areas of responsibility for both organizations.
   Officials said the accord should help to resolve tensions
between the two agencies, which have found their lending functions
increasingly overlapped in recent years.
   In another development, the agency that guarantees investments
by industrial countries against political risk in the Third World
said it will likely begin writing its first insurance policies this
June.
   Leigh P. Hollywood, an official of the new Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency, said that most of the 60 applicants
for insurance policies have come from companies located in the
United States.
   The U.S. government and 72 other countries have pledged $744
million to establish the new agency, which was created as an arm of
the World Bank to encourage foreign investment in the Third World
by protecting investors against such risks as war, civil
disturbances and expropriation of assets.

   A Circuit judge on Thursday said he
would allow Home Shopping Network Inc. to ask for $1 billion in
punitive damages against GTE Corp. in a suit over telephone service
and set trial for June 5.
   Pinellas Circuit Judge Howard P. Rives reversed an earlier order
and said he would allow HSN to make the hefty punitive claim
against the telephone company.
   James V. Carideo, vice president and general counsel of GTE
Florida, said Rives' ruling was ``purely procedural.''
   The punitive damages are in addition to the $500 million HSN is
seeking from GTE in compensatory fines.
   In September 1987, HSN sued GTE claiming the utility knowingly
provided defective and inadequate telephone equipment and services.
HSN alleged that GTE deliberately concealed the defects and misled
the video retailer in order to keep the lucrative account.
   Last November, Rives ruled that it was necessary for Home
Shopping to present evidence of GTE misconduct before claiming
punitive damages.
   In asking to have the claim reinstated, HSN presented documents,
some from from GTE files, which the company says backs its
allegations. Rives' ruling Thursday means HSN may take its case
before a jury.
   ``HSN was convinced when it filed the lawsuit in 1987 that it
was entitled to punitive damages. Today's ruling will allow us to
present all our claims to the jury,'' said Nando DiFilippo Jr.,
executive vice president and general counsel for HSN.
   Rives said the case should take four- to six weeks.
   GTE Florida's Carideo said, ``We look forward to showing at
trial, as our counterclaim states, that HSN's suit is a `sham' and
`an attempted cover-up for management problems.'''

   The airline didn't immediately respond to the $90-a-share offer

   Davis, who made his fortune in oil and real estate and has
traded in Hollywood companies in recent years, said he had
accumulated 3 percent of the stock in NWA Inc., the Eagan,
Minn.-based holding company for the airline.
   The proposal raised the possibility of a bidding war for the

<HEAD>Canada Announces Trade Sanctions Against U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: All monetary figures U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trade Minister John Crosbie announced Thursday
that Canada will impose trade sanctions against the United States
in retaliation for a U.S. oil import tax that has been ruled
discriminatory under world trade rules.
   The action was seen as an escalation of a U.S.-Canadian dispute
over Canadian fish export regulations.
   Crosbie said in a statement that Canada has lost patience with
U.S. failure to comply with a 1987 ruling by the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade that the so-called Superfund oil tax _ a tax
imposed to help pay for environmental protection _ violates world
trade rules.
   The move came two days after U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills said the United States will retaliate against regulations
that protect Canada's West Coast herring- and salmon-processing
industry.
   ``I would call it a tit-for-tat move,'' said one U.S. official,
who spoke on the condition of not being identified.
   Spokeswoman Danielle Ayotte of the External Affairs Department,
however, denied any linkage between the disputes. She said no
decision has been made on what U.S. products may be affected by
sanctions.
   She said the oil dispute came up when Hills and Crosbie met in
Washington this month, but that there was no movement on the U.S.
side.
   ``It has been going on for a long time. I think we have been
very patient,'' she said.
   Ayotte said Canada had no option but to seek formal authority
from GATT to remove U.S. trading privileges. The sanctions probably
would comprise tariffs or quotas on U.S. products. It could take
months before they could go into effect.
   Crosbie expressed hope that Washington would act before that
happened, saying, ``Our preference is that the United States remove
this discriminatory tax. We are not interested in retaliatory
action for its own sake.''
   But a U.S. official, also insisting on anonymity, said Canada is
irritated that Washington acted to retaliate against Canadian fish
products without approval by the Geneva-based, 96-nation GATT
organization, and could be out to teach the United States a lesson.
   Crosbie chided the Americans on Wednesday for acting under U.S.
trade law before getting approval from GATT.
   Canada says it will replace the export restrictions on raw
herring and salmon with new conservation regulations that will
conform to GATT.
   The United States imposed the oil tax in 1986 as part of the
U.S. Superfund to finance a multibillion-dollar war chest for
environmental cleanup.
   Although Canada supported the principle of the Superfund, it
complained to GATT because the U.S. tax on imported oil was 11.7
cents per barrel while the tax on oil produced in the United States
was only 8.2 cents.
   The tax adds $8.37 million a year to the cost of oil imported
from Canada, and Canada would be allowed to impose sanctions of the
same value.
   Hans Maciej, vice president of the Canadian Petroleum
Association in Calgary, said he didn't know if this was ``the right
bullet to use.'' The Bush administration has been working to get
Congress to comply with the GATT ruling anyway, he said.
   However, he said the Superfund tax isn't a critical issue for
Canadian oil exporters. ``It's an irritant.''

   Midway Airlines ordered 29 MD-82
mid-range airliners from McDonnell Douglas Corp., the manufacturer
announced Thursday.
   Combined with an earlier order of eight MD-87 planes, the value
of the Midway order is $900 million, Douglas said. The company
wouldn't reveal the value of just the new order.
   Midway also signed an agreement giving it the option to buy an
additional 37 of the twin-jet MD-82s, according to a statement from
Douglas Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas Corp. of
St. Louis.
   Chicago-based Midway, which serves both domestic and Caribbean
airports, took delivery Thursday of the first two of of the eight
MD-87 planes it ordered last year, the company said.
   Delivery of the new order of MD-82s is set to begin in late 1993
and run through 1997.
   The two models of plane are similar in design. The MD-82 can
carry up to 172 passengers and the MD-87 can be configured to carry
a maximum of 139.

   Oil and entertainment mogul Marvin Davis
offered $2.6 billion cash Thursday to buy Northwest Airlines, a
company that just this week erected takeover defenses in response
to an overture from a different suitor.
   NWA Inc., parent of the Eagan, Minn.-based airline, refused to
comment on the unsolicited Davis bid, which the investor stressed
was friendly.
   Davis, who made his fortune in oil and real estate and has
traded in Hollywood companies in recent years, said in revealing
his offer that he had already accumulated 3 percent of NWA stock.
   He offered $90 a share for the company's 29.1 million
outstanding shares for a buyout to be negotiated with management.
   Northwest spokesman spokesman Bob Gibbons said company officials
would withhold comment until its board of directors had studied the
bid, which was revealed late Thursday afternoon here.
   On Tuesday, the airline's board adopted a ``poison pill''
takeover defense in response to expressions of interest by a
potential buyer whose identity the company wouldn't reveal. That
suitor has bought 4.9 percent of NWA's stock and expressed an
interest in a leveraged buyout, NWA said.
   Davis' statement indicated he wasn't involved in the earlier
offer.
   His bid, announced after the stock markets closed, values the
company at considerably more that its current stock price. NWA
shares closed at $68.25 Thursday, down from $68.75 the day before.
   Davis, 63, former owner of 20th Century Fox Film Corp., said
that if he were successful in buying Northwest, he would keep the
company intact and under present management.
   ``He believes that Minnesota is the logical and best place for
this airline,'' said Davis spokeswoman Mary Conway. ``There is no
intention of selling off any assets to finance this deal.''
   Davis is willing to boost his bid if the company agrees to
negotiate and demonstrates it is worth more, Ms. Conway said.
   In response to the earlier suitor's expression of interest,
Northwest management and unions promised to fight to remain
independent, and state officials suggested they might consider
legislation to hamper a hostile takeover. The company's poison pill
defense gives current stockholders the right to buy new stock
cheaply in the event of a hostile takeover attempt, thereby making
it more costly to obtain a controlling amount of stock.
   Guy Cook, head of Northwest's Machinists' union local, said:
``Our main concern is does Marvin Davis or any other suitor wish to
run an airline or make a lot of money and walk away? I would want
more details before I make up my mind whether Marvin Davis is ready
to come in and run an airline.''
   Analysts have suggested the company is a tempting takeover
target because of its lagging stock price and attractive real
estate holdings in Tokyo.
   NWA reported 1988 earnings of $135.1 million a share, up 31.1
percent from $103 million in 1987. In August 1986, Northwest
acquired rival Republic Airlines for $884 million.
   Davis built his empire on Davis Oil Co. in Denver and on
extensive real estate investments. He was in the news most recently
last week when he teamed up with Prudential Insurance Co. to buy
Spectradyne, a Richardson, Texas, pay-television company, for $635
million.
   In March 1988, he was rebuffed in a $770 million bid for Lorimar
Telepictures Corp., a TV production firm that since was bought by
Warner Communications Inc.
   He bought 20th Century Fox in 1981 and sold it to media tychoon
Rupert Murdoch in 1985, making an estimated $325 million on the
deal. He also is rumored to have explored the possibility of
bidding on MGM-UA Communications Co. and Warner, which is in the
process of merging with Time Inc.
   His real estate holdings include the Snomwass, Buttermilk and
Aspen Mountain ski resorts in Colorado and golf courses in Pebble
Beach, Calif.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Multi-billion Dollar Fine for Milken Unlikely</HEAD>

   Junk bond financier Michael R. Milken is as
unlikely to receive a multibillion dollar fine as he is a 500-year
prison term, even if he is convicted on every count of a mammoth
racketeering and securities fraud indictment, a federal prosecutor
said Thursday.
   Milken, head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high yield bond
department, and two others were indicated Wednesday on charges they
turned Drexel into a racketeering enterprise that engaged in
securities violations ranging from insider trading to stock market
manipulation.
   All three were charged with racketeering and conspiring to
violate federal racketeering laws, which each carry a maximum
20-year sentence upon conviction.
   Milken, his brother Lowell and former Drexel trader Bruce
Newberg each face maximum fines of $3.7 billion if convicted on
either or both of the racketeering counts, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Bruce Baird.
   Those fines represent the highest possible amounts under federal
racketeering law _ that is, double the gains made from the
allegedly illegal enterprise _ that a judge may impose.
   The defendants also face fines of at least $250,000 and up to
five years imprisonment on each of the lesser charges of mail, wire
and securities fraud. In Michael Milken's case, that's an
additional 96 counts or a total of $24 million more in fines and a
possible 520 years imprisonment.
   But Baird conceded such totals were ``unrealistic.''
   ``Neither the possible maximum fine nor the possible maximum
prison term is a penalty that the government expects will be fully
imposed,'' said Baird, head of the securities and commodities fraud
unit at the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.
   ``A fine, like a term of imprisonment, is something within the
discretion of the judge after conviction,'' said the prosecutor.
For example, he added, for Milken a judge could impose either no
jail time or the maximum 520 years upon conviction.
   But based on past sentencing practices in other major
racketeering and securities cases, it appeared unlikely a judge
would impose the fullest possible penalties against the three,
Baird indicated.
   Far more realistic, said Baird, was that if the three were
convicted of either racketeering count they would have to forfeit a
total of $1.85 billion in allegedly illegal gains made from their
enterprise.
   Forfeiture is a penalty unique to the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Baird said.
   The $1.85 billion represents virtually all the money Milken and
his co-defendants made from their dealings with Drexel or from
their financial stake in Drexel from 1984 through 1987 _ the years
covered by the indictment _ which is subject to forefeiture under
the federal racketeering law.
   That includes all salaries and bonuses, totaling $1.2 billion;
Drexel stock worth $112 million; $205 million in corporate finance
fees and $37.9 million in Drexel trading profits allegedly tainted
by fraud.
   Prosecutors also are seeking $257 million in interest.
   Baird said the trial jury would decide whether to order
forfeiture after a racketeering conviction.
   Baird said the government did not plan to seek a court order
freezing the trio's assets.
   ``We're going to give them an opportunity to post a bond
first,'' said Baird. He said the bond would be like posting bail
for their assets ``to assure the assets will still be there in the
event of a conviction on the RICO charges.''
