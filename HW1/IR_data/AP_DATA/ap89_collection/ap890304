   Every car should yield 42 miles per gallon and
carbon dioxide emissions should be cut 20 percent to fight the
``greenhouse effect'' that may threaten Earth's climate and human
health, a conference recommended Friday.
   Four hundred scientists and public officials from 13 countries
attended the four-day Global Climate Change meeting that focused on
the warming of the atmosphere and damage to Earth's protective ozone
layer.
   ``The activities of 5 billion people on Earth are clearly
producing changes in the world's climate,'' said Mark Harwell,
director of Cornell University's Global Environment Program. ``In
our lifetimes, and certainly in our children's, climate changes and
other environmental impacts will profoundly affect the way humans
live.''
   The participants called for changes in human activities whose
by-products are gases that may be causing a rise in atmospheric
temperatures, resulting in hotter summers, droughts, more violent
storms, rising sea levels and an increase in diseases.
   The participants urged Congress to pass a more stringent version
of the Clean Air Act, and to stop production by the year 2000 of all
chlorofluorocarbons, which cause the ``greenhouse'' effect.
   They also recommended that the fuel economy of all new cars be
increased by 1{ mpg per year to at least 42 mpg by the year 2000.
Other energy sources, including nuclear plants, should be used more
efficiently and with added safety standards, the participants said.
   The conference also urged that land use and building controls be
enacted to provide for nature conservation, coupled with increased
mass transit that would reduce automobile congestion.
   The conference was convened by Gov. Mario Cuomo, Gov. Tom Keane
of New Jersey, Gov. Madeleine Kunin of Vermont, Cornell University
and the National Governors' Association.
   Among those who addressed the meeting were physicist Carl Sagan;
Ted Turner, head of the CNN cable network; Sen. Albert Gore, Jr.,
D-Tenn.; and Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.
   The 150 scientists attending the meeting included Vassily Sokolov
of the Soviet Union's Institute of U.S.A. and Canada Studies and Ma
Shijun, chairman of China's Commission on the Environment.
   ``We must learn to understand and live rather than fight natural
forces, including those unleashed by our own activities,'' said the
participants in their final recommendation.

   A woman convicted of instigating her
daughter's suicide by pushing her to work as a nude dancer will be
allowed to profit from her story, a judge has ruled.
   ``I'm very happy,'' Theresa Jackson said Thursday. ``I'm glad to
get it over with.''
   The agreement between the state and Ms. Jackson, approved
Thursday by Broward Circuit Judge Arthur J. Franza, will require her
to share whatever money she might get from her story with the state
and with her 18-year-old son.
   Ms. Jackson's lawyer, Donna Draves, estimated her client could
receive between $50,000 to $200,000 for film and book rights to her
story.
   Ms. Jackson, 42, was convicted in October 1987 of child abuse,
forgery and procuring a sexual performance by a child. She was
sentenced to a year in jail but is free on bail during an appeal.
   Her 17-year-old daughter, Tina Mancini, shot and killed herself
in the family's Coral Springs home in March 1986. During a two-week
trial, state prosecutors claimed Ms. Jackson traumatized her
daughter by encouraging her to work as a nude dancer, even forging
the girl's birth certificate to make it appear she was older.
   Lawyers said the case was the first in the United States in which
a person was charged with mental child abuse in connection with a
suicide.
   Originally, the state had sought to block Ms. Jackson from
getting any money, citing a never-before-used state law barring
felons from profiting from depictions of their crimes.
   Under terms of Thursday's settlement, the state would receive
about $35,000 for trial and jail costs from any earnings Ms. Jackson
receives from her story. Part of the remaining earnings would be
shared by Ms. Jackson's 18-year-old son.
   Ms. Jackson's former attorney, Kenneth Whitman, has his own claim
pending against Ms. Jackson, contending he is owed $150,000 in
attorney's fees from the trial, and he is seeking to overturn the
agreement with the state. A hearing on that claim is scheduled for
next week.

<TEXT>
   A woman whose husband was slain at the
convenience store where he worked said the company's insurer refused
to pay the $138 hospital bill she incurred for treatment of shock
after the killing.
   Georgianna Lee's insurance claim was returned unpaid last week by
the Lewer Agency Inc., of Kansas City, Mo., the company most
7-Eleven stores use to provide health and life insurance for their
employees.
   Mrs. Lee's husband, Frederick Lee Jr., was shot to death Jan. 14
at a 7-Eleven store in nearby Vernon where he was night manager.
Mrs. Lee of Ellington, north of Hartford, was treated for shock in
the emergency room at Rockville General Hospital after his killing.
   The Lewer Agency said it was denying payment of the charges
because the ``policy does not cover treatment of nervous and mental
conditions.''
   Mrs. Lee, who was covered under her husband's policy, said she
was first dumbfounded then angry.
   ``Under the circumstances I expected without any question at all
that this hospital bill would have been paid,'' she said Wednesday.
``It's not the money. It's the principle of how a company could do
this to me. You give your life for your job and this is how you're
treated in return.''
   A 23-year-old man was been charged as an accessory in Lee's
killing. Officials have not determined a motive in the slaying.
   Phil Oftedahl, human resources manager for Southland Corp.'s New
England office in Middletown, said he has contacted the Lewer Agency
about the unpaid hospital bill and is waiting for a response. He
also said Southland only recommends the Lewer Agency to its 7-Eleven
franchise owners.
   Mike Dlugolecki, a spokesman for the Lewer Agency, declined to
comment.

<HEAD>Major Figure in Iran-Contra Case Gets Probation, Fine</HEAD>

   Former national security adviser Robert C.
McFarlane became the first participant in the Iran-Contra affair to
be sentenced, receiving a $20,000 fine and suspended prison term.
   McFarlane, placed on two-years' probation Friday for misleading
Congress about covert U.S. support for the Nicaraguan rebels, will
be a key prosecution witness at the ongoing trial of his former aide
Oliver L. North.
   Leaving the U.S. Courthouse with his wife, Jonda, McFarlane said
the ordeal left him with ``strong faith and a terrific wife and a
free country.''
   ``I am looking to the future,'' he said.
   McFarlane admitted he misled Congress by denying that North was
helping the Contras raise money and transfer weapons when lawmakers
had banned U.S. aid.
   In a sentencing proceeding that lasted barely five minutes, U.S.
District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. said McFarlane must complete
200 hours of community service during his probabtion.
   Robinson said ``the nature of the offense and the totality of the
circumstances'' required him to impose a $20,000 fine.
   McFarlane could have received a four-year prison term and a
$400,000 fine for pleading guilty to four misdemeanor charges of
withholding information from Congress.
   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel stood at ease with his
hands clasped below his waist as he listened to the comments of his
attorney, Leonard Garment and the judge.
   ``The public servants in this country are not to be found to be
more decent and more honorable,'' Garment said. ``Every action on
his part .... was taken out of a high sense of duty, a strong sense
of serving his country's interests.''
   McFarlane accompanied North to Tehran in May 1986 on an
unsuccessful arms-for-hostages mission. McFarlane, by this time
retired from government, carried a key-shaped cake and a Bible
signed by President Reagan as a show of good faith.
   In his emotionless voice, McFarlane said: ``Clearly, this episode
in our history has rendered enormous turmoil on our country's
processes.
   ``To the extent that I contributed to that I regret it. I tried
to serve my country.''
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who negotiated the plea
agreement with McFarlane before North and three co-defendants were
indicted last year, told reporters outside the courthouse his office
had made no recommendation about the sentence. He refused to comment
further.
   The sentencing took place on a day that North's trial had
recessed for legal arguments. Former Air Force Lt. Col. Richard
Gadd, who provided aircraft for the Nicaraguan rebels during the
``secret war'' that prosecutors say North waged after Congress
banned military aid, is scheduled to continue testifying when the
trial resumes Monday.
   McFarlane had asked to be sentenced before he took the witness
stand against North.
   He pleaded guilty March 11, 1988, to charges that he misled
Congress in 1985 by stating in three letters that North was not
helping raise money for the Contras or providing military assistance.
   The letters were written to the House intelligence committee and
the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the western hemisphere in
response to queries about news reports that North was providing aid
in defiance of the ban imposed by Congress.
   Among the 12 felony charges against North are allegations that he
made false statement to Congress by drafting the false letters that
McFarlane signed.
   The defense contends that McFarlane should be held responsible
for those letters, not North, who was below his boss on the chain of
command.
   McFarlane also admitted misleading the full Foreign Affairs
Committee in testimony after the Iran-Contra affair became public in
later 1986 by denying knowledge of efforts to raise money from
foreign governments to help arm the rebels.

   About the only clue the stocky, balding
middle-aged man has about his past is the name ``Snuffy'' engraved
on the back of his belt.
   He doesn't know who he is, how he got to Gainesville or anything
before Feb. 8, when he awoke in a wooded area near Shands Hospital
with no wallet and no form of identification.
   He is 5-foot-11, weighs 250 pounds and has a tattoo on his arm.
He was wearing blue jeans, boots, flannel shirt and tinted
prescription glasses when found.
   The hospital said brain scans and other evaluations showed no
signs of a blow to the head or any other physical causes for
amnesia, such as epilepsy or alcohol-related brain malfunction.
   Dr. Ross McElroy, a Shands psychiatrist, said the man is
apparently suffering from a psychological form of amnesia, probably
triggered by a great mental shock or stress.
   The man fears family members may be worrying about him somewhere.
   ``It took two or three days to sort of pull myself through the
fog,'' the man said. ``I spend every waking moment trying to figure
out who ... I am.''
   The man, who is fairly articulate, speaks with a Southwestern
accent and likes to read, sat with mental health counselor W.J.
Tootie Richey and posed for pictures Thursday in hopes of a
breakthrough _ someone who remembers what he can't.
   He said the name ``Snuffy'' doesn't ring a bell for him. ``I
didn't like it at first,'' he said, but ``it seems better than John
Doe.''
   Ms. Richey said her client is able to talk and interact with
people well. He has been reading voraciously, especially newspapers.
   The Alachua County sheriff's office has taken the man's
fingerprints and physical description; there are apparently no
warrants for his arrest.
   There is a good chance that his memory will return, either in
bits and pieces or a sudden rush, authorities said. Most similar
amnesia victims regain most or all their memory within a few days or
weeks.
   McElroy said forgetting an entire life is especially rare.
   The chances are ``you're going to find that there's something
that this guy's getting away from,'' McElroy said.
   ``Whatever I'm responsible for, I want to live up to,'' said the
mystery man.

<HEAD>Tower Backers Want Him to Testify Before Full Senate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John Tower's Senate allies, struggling to gain
the offensive in a tense confirmation battle, are suggesting that
the defense secretary-designate come to the Senate floor and respond
``charge by charge'' to the allegations against him.
   ``If we owe Senator Tower anything, we owe him the right to say,
`I've had my day in court,''' Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole said
Friday as Tower's confirmation chances dimmed further with two
additional Democrats joining the opposition.
   Dole stopped short of turning his suggestion into a formal
proposal, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said
he would be ``happy to consider any request.''
   Mitchell also said he was troubled by the confirmation
proceedings, in which material from a confidential FBI report that
is damaging to Tower has been leaked in the news media but may not
be discussed openly on the Senate floor. He became the second senior
Democrat in as many days to suggest a closed Senate session to
permit a full airing of the allegations contained in the FBI report.
   Tower has been battling questions of his drinking habits, his
behavior toward women and his lucrative work as a defense industry
consultant after serving as a U.S. arms control negotiator. The FBI
report contains numerous allegations, but Republicans say few if any
of them are corroborated, and insist nothing in it disqualifies him
from the Cabinet post.
   The Senate is in recess until Monday, when debate is expected to
resume on the nomination, although Tower and several senators are
certain to keep the controversy alive over the weekend with
appearances scheduled on television interview programs. The
Associated Press vote count shows 47 Democrats and GOP Sen. Larry
Pressler either committed or leaning against the nomination and 40
Republicans committed or leaning in favor, with the rest undecided.
   The Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate.
   Dole's surprise suggestion _ only six people have ever been
called to the Senate in 200 years to answer charges against them _
came near the end of a day of debate in which two additional
Democrats announced their opposition and a string of Republicans
complained that Tower was being treated unfairly.
   ``We've got to even up the score somehow,'' said the Senate GOP
leader.
   Arguing that limitations on public references to the FBI report
make it impossible ``to get at the truth,'' Dole suggested bringing
Tower to the floor ``to answer his critics face-to-face,
charge-by-charge, rumor-by-rumor and fact-by-fact.''
   Several Republicans defended Tower earlier in a long day of
debate.
   ``The Senate has abandoned fairness and the object of that
abandonment is John Tower,'' said Sen. Malcolm Wallop , R-Wyo.
   Sen. Ted Stevens said the evidence in the FBI report was so
flimsy that no prosecutor would use it for an indictment, and said
of Tower, ``He is my friend. I thought he was your friend and I want
some justice for my friend.''
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho. called on a few Democrats to swing
behind the nomination before partisanship overwhelmed the debate
completely, but the only two Democrats to announce _ conservative
Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and liberal Barbara Mikulski of Maryland
_ said they would oppose confirmation.
   DeConcini had been counted by the White House as a potential
convert to Tower's cause, but in a written statement, he noted the
allegations against Tower and said, ``We cannot take a chance.
   An angry Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., called for the release
of the FBI report, noting the Republican charge that the Democrats
have based their opposition on allegations, not facts.
   ``It's our character that's being assassinated here and I'm sick
and tired of it,'' said Hollings.
   Release of the FBI report is a decision that only the White House
can make.

   The Bush administration is attempting to ease
Venezuela's financial crisis by providing the new government of
President Carlos Andres Perez with a $450 million ``bridge loan,''
U.S. officials have disclosed.
   The South American nation saw its worst violence in 31 years, in
a series of riots this week spawned by a series of price increases
imposed as part of an economic reform program.
   An estimated 300 people died and 1,500 were injured in the
disturbances, touched off by the new austerity program designed by
Perez to cope with a $33 billion foreign debt.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday that President
Bush spoke Friday with Perez in a telephone call, in which Bush
lauded Venezuela's ``courageous and determined efforts'' to resolve
its dire economic and financial problems.
   Fitzwater said Bush had called Perez to express ``his concern for
the recent difficulties'' in Venezuela.
   Two other U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed later in the day that the a bridge loan was approved as a
means of serving the country's short-term financial needs.
   ``President Bush talked to him,'' one of the officials said.
``It's coming through,'' the official said of the loan.
   Both officials are familiar with the Venezuelan debt problem and
were involved in discussions about the loan.
   The bridge loan will provide Venezuela with temporary relief
because its depleted treasury has had difficulting meeting interest
payments to commercial banks and other international lenders.
   Fitzwater, asked about the reported loan, confirmed the two
presidents discussed the issue in their phone call. But the
spokesman said the matter wasn't finalized and the ``many details''
had to be worked out.
   The United States has frequently provided bridge loans to other
Latin American nations, such as Mexico and Argentina, which had
depleted treasuries.
   The austerity program was mandated by the International Monetary
Fund as a requirement for granting $4.3 billion in loans over the
next three years.
   The IMF has taken steps to provide Caracas with an immediate $450
million payment.
   Increases of 30 percent to 50 percent in public transport tariffs
and price gouging by bus drivers set off the rioting, amounting to
the worst violence in Venezuela in 31 years.
   The nation of 18 million has been regarded as an island of
tranquility amid a region of increasing violence, political
stability and economic repression.
   The president's action was seen as another attempt to give
Perez's 29-day old administration some breathing room to deal with
its financial woes. Vice President Dan Quayle attended Perez's Feb.
2 inauguration. The Venezuelan official was elected in a landslide
Dec. 4.
   ``He reiterated U.S. support for their democracies and for
President Perez's courageous and determined efforts to address his
country's economic and financial situation,'' Fitzwater said, when
describing the call between the two presidents.

   Merchants and town officials in this
barrier island resort community have hatched an idea they think will
put them in the pink.
   With nary a squawk Thursday, the Santa Rosa Island Authority's
Development and Leasing Committee endorsed a plan to turn Pensacola
Beach's water tower into a 10-story pink flamingo.
   George Garmon, sales manager for Lamar Advertising Co., a
billboard company in nearby Pensacola, pitched the idea, dubbed
``Project Pink,'' to the panel.
   He said the big bird could be to Pensacola what the Eiffel Tower
is to Paris and the Statue of Liberty is to New York. He even
envisioned an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records.
   Several merchants urged approval. Ross Orenstein, general manager
of Sun Ray Cottage, said shops could sell pink flamingo T-shirts,
bars could serve similarly themed drinks and the community could
have a pink flamingo parade.
   Cost of construction the bird could be borne by business
sponsors, the merchants suggested.
   The proposal goes to the authority's full board next week.

   The pigeons ignored plastic owls, traps
and helium balloons; they were unruffled by high-frequency sound
waves. So authorities are now mulling using a sticky paste to
dissuade the birds from roosting at hangers at an airpark.
   Pigeon droppings have destroyed insulation in the new $40 million
hangars at Chennault Airpark and corroded paint on the KC-135 U.S.
Air Force tankers refurbished at the Boeing Corp. plant, officials
say.
   Lake Charles is considered a bird sanctuary, and a city ordinance
forbids hunting, trapping and shooting birds within city limits.
   At a public hearing to address the problem Thursday, Harry Avery
said his company makes an adhesive that's strong enough to alarm the
pigeons _ and make them stay away from places they've encountered it
_ but too weak to make the birds permanent fixtures.
   The repellant, a clear, sticky gel, is guaranteed for two years,
is non-toxic and does not sting, burn or harm birds, said Avery, of
Hot Foot International in Baton Rouge.

   President Bush rejected a mediation board recommendation to use
his authority under provisions of the Railway Labor Act and delay
the strike for 60 more days.
   Bush also warned he would not tolerate sympathy strikes
threatened by other unions to support the Machinists.
   Eastern wanted Bush to stay out of the dispute, saying either a
strike, if it involved pilots, or postponement of the strike, would
lead to bankruptcy.
   The AFL-CIO and 33 senators had asked Bush to intervene to
prevent ``a major disruption of interstate commerce.''

   Eastern said it would slash up to 75 percent of its weekend
flights, including most services from its Atlanta hub and about 60
other cities.
   The airline said earlier that it was prepared to operate during
any strike and had contracted with 1,100 non-union mechanics to
service planes.
   Eastern's pilots rejected an appeal Thursday by airline owner
Frank Lorenzo for them to sign a new contract and cross Machinists
picket lines.
   Flight attendants said they would honor picket lines.
   Airports nationwide strengthened security and other airlines have
reported surges in sales this week.

<NOTE>MACHINISTS SENT HOME</NOTE>

   Eastern obtained a federal court order and sent its machinists
home, saying the action was intended to prevent sabotage.
   Machinists were given a paid holiday and told to return to work
for shifts starting at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, one minute after the
strike deadline. Eastern said management personnel would handle
ground duties for the rest of the day.

<NOTE>NEGOTIATIONS END</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern's offer Thursday was rejected Friday by the Machinists
union, and federal officials said they expected a strike at the
midnight deadline as talks continued between the airline and the
union.
   Eastern said the contract offered would reduce mechanics' pay but
still keep their salaries 13 percent higher than employees who took
a 20 percent pay cut when Lorenzo took over in 1986. It said baggage
handlers' cuts would be no greater than those of other employees.
   At 12:01 a.m., the Machinists went on strike.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LABOR SUPPORT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and other union leaders said they
doubted there would be any settlement because Lorenzo wants to
dismantle Eastern, which they said is worth about $500 million.
   Other unions pledged support in a plan to block work at other
airlines, railways and sea transport companies if a strike is called.
   The Airline Pilots Association announced that in the event of an
Eastern strike, it would instruct its 40,000 members beginning
Tuesday to strictly follow procedures that would cause ``substantial
delays.''
   Kirkland said the AFL's 14 million members should honor the
Eastern pickets wherever they are legally set up.
   A federal court in Minnesota enjoined Northwest Airlines
employees from staging a sympathy strike. Other airlines and the
union won a U.S. District Court order in Washington that banned
picketing of companies other than Eastern.

<HEAD>US Agrees to Quicker Reduction in CFCs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States is joining its European
allies in pushing for elimination of all ozone-depleting chemicals
by the end of the century, a sharp acceleration of the schedule for
ending their use.
   President Bush said Friday he has asked the head of the
Environmental Protection Agency to join the call to ban
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by the year 2000 at an international
conference that begins this weekend in London.
   ``Recent studies indicate the 50 percent reduction (of CFCs as
provided by a 1987 treaty) may not be enough,'' Bush said.
   The United States accounts for about one-third of the production
of ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily CFCs, which are widely used
as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners and as a cleaning
agent for electronic and computer equipment.
   Scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it
floats into the stratosphere before it breaks down, interacting with
the gaseous veil of ozone that shields against the sun's
cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly flew to London on Friday to
take part in the conference to discuss ways to slow down ozone
destruction. Representatives from more than 100 nations also will
take part in the meetings being hosted by British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
   In remarks to a group of high school science contest winners at
the National Academy of Sciences, the president said the United
States will support the call ``for the elimination of CFCs by the
year 2000 provided safe substitutes are available.''
   Reilly, according to administration sources, had strongly
recommended at a White House meeting Thursday that the United States
join its European allies and call for the complete elimination of
CFCs, as opposed to cutting production by 50 percent as required by
current treaty.
   Many scientists have said that a 50 percent cutback would not be
enough to protect against serious ozone depletion.
   On Thursday, the 12 nations of the European Economic Community
announced that they have agreed to a ban on the chemical in their
countries by the end of the century.
   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., another members of the U.S. delegation to
the London conference, said Friday that even quicker action is
needed because ``every year of delay implies an additional five to
10 years that these chemicals will remain in the atmosphere.''
   Gore has called for elimination of all CFCs by 1994.
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., ranking minority member of the
Environment and Public Works Committee, called the president's move
``very encouraging'' but also urged that CFCs be eliminated well
before the year 2000.
   The 1987 treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations, including
the United States, Japan, most of Western Europe and Soviet Union.
But it includes a provision that allows additional measures,
including a complete ban, if further ozone damage is found.
   The parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider an
accelerated phase-out schedule at a meeting in Helsinki, Finland, in
early May. The London meeting, which begins Sunday, is described as
a dress rehearsal for the Helsinki session.
   According to the World Resources Institute, the United States
produces roughly one-third of the world's CFCs, with E.I. DuPont de
Nemours &amp; Co. the world's largest producer. There were 750 million
pounds of CFCs produced in the United States last year and about the
same amount in Western Europe, according to Dupont.
   Dupont, which accounts for about half of the U.S. production, has
announced plans to stop making the chemical, perhaps as early as the
mid-1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year.

<HEAD>Feds Order Airlines To Check Boeing 747 Cargo Doors Within 30 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued an
emergency order on Friday, requiring all U.S. airlines to reinforce
latch mechanisms on Boeing 747 cargo doors within 30 days, so the
doors are less vulnerable to damage from improper closing.
   The emergency Airworthiness Directive, which speeds up the
timetable of an earlier directive, also specifies special
inspections and tests of the doors that must be done until
modifications are completed.
   The action Friday follows the Feb. 24 United Airlines accident
near Honolulu in which a 10-by-20-foot hole was torn in a 747
fuselage. Nine people were swept to their deaths.
   The cause of the accident has yet to be determined, but the
possible failure of the forward cargo door latch is under
investigation. The door separated from the aircraft with parts of
the fuselage that surrounded it.
   The 747 order affects about 150 airplanes. However, Tom Neale of
the Air Transport Association in Washington, D.C., said some
airlines have already made the required modifications, which include
steel reinforcements to cargo door latches.
   The FAA issued a directive July 1 ordering the doors inspected
and modified by the end of 1989 or July 1, 1990, depending on the
type of locking mechanism installed.
   That order was issued after a cargo door on a Pan Am 747 opened
1{ inches at the start of a flight from London to San Francisco. FAA
officials said at the time the situation did not warrant an
emergency directive.
   The FAA also said it soon would issue another Airworthiness
Directive requiring improvements in the warning system that alerts
flight crews when any cargo door is not properly closed and locked.
The directive was expected as soon as the design improvements can be
delivered and tested.
   There were similarities in the events on the Pan Am and United
planes. The cargo doors in both instances had to be closed by hand
rather than electrically, after they had been malfunctioning. There
were no warning lights to indicate whether the doors were open, said
both flight crews.
   Additionally, the agency has formed a team to review all current
Boeing service bulletins on the 747 cargo door to determine whether
instructions are complete and understandable, the FAA said Friday in
a statement issued in Seattle.
   The team is focusing on the possibility of human error that might
be associated with specific procedures. It is expected to complete
its work within a week.
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said changes made in the latest
directive, from the July 1, 1988, order, included visual inspection
of the cargo door latch before each flight, new torque limits on the
door if it is closed manually, and shorter timetables for inspection
for damage and of electrical systems.
   He said Boeing supported the action by the FAA, and in fact had
suggested in service bulletins of March and April 1987, the cargo
door improvements that were included in the FAA's directive of July
1988.
   The FAA also ordered immediate inspections of Dash 8-100 planes
made by de Havilland of Canada, a Boeing subsidiary, because faulty
connections were found in fire-extinguishing systems on two of the
Canadian-made Dash 8-100 airliners.

   Stacy Keach didn't mind the 125-foot parachute
plunge into downtown's Glitter Gulch, the motorcycle chase across
the desert or squaring off against ex-football terror Lyle Alzado.
   But don't ask him to repeat that 50-yard swim in 50-degree Lake
Mead _ at least not with his shoes on.
   Keach spent the past week in Las Vegas filming a two-hour
television special ``Murder Takes All _ Mike Hammer in Las Vegas.''
The movie has tested the mettle of Keach, who has a penchant for
doing many of his own stunts.
   One scene called for Hammer to jump from a yacht just before it
explodes and swim 50 yards. Keach, 47, did the stunt wearing a
wetsuit under his clothing to help ward off the chill of the
50-degree water.
   In the first take he also wore his shoes, and learned it was a
serious mistake.
   ``I'm telling you, you almost lost me,'' Keach said after
struggling against the weight of the clothes and trying to kick with
his shoes on.
   Subsequent takes of the scene were shot with Keach swimming
shoeless.

   Comedian Pat Paulsen has accused his
estranged wife of forgery and harassment in response to a
counterclaim she filed in their divorce proceedings last year.
   Linda Chaney Paulsen had accused Paulsen of seeking a divorce to
get control of the profitable Pat Paulsen Enterprises Inc., which
she managed.
   Chaney Paulsen, 35, was not commenting on the case, but her
attorney, Nathan Davidovich, said she is working on a book, ``Being
Married to a Comedian Is No Laughing Matter.''
   Paulsen, 61, lodged the original complaint in Jefferson County
Court in September after filing for divorce in Denver District
Court, just two months after the couple had married.
   His new motion this week asks that the counterclaim be dismissed,
saying it was filed ``solely to harass, cause an unnecessary delay
in these proceedings and needlessly increase the cost of this
litigation.''

   Surviving members of the Allman Brothers Band,
whose bluesy mix of guitars and keyboards helped define what came to
be known as ``Southern rock'' in the 1970s, are talking about a
reunion album and concert.
   Gregg Allman, Dickey Betts, Butch Trucks and Jai Johnny Johanson
_ better known to some as Jaimoe _ met this week at Trucks' Pegasus
Studios in Tallahassee, Fla.
   ``It was the best conversation the four of us have had in 20
years,'' Trucks said. ``Everybody's definitely into doing it before
we get too old to do it.''
   Trucks said the the band's albums from the late 1960s and early
'70s are ``still getting an awful lot of airplay.''
   Some of the band's hits included ``Rambling Man,'' ``Whippin'
Post'' and ``In Memory of Elizabeth Reed.''
   Right now the classic rock radio format is very popular, and for
the Allman Brothers Band to attract radio airplay they need to act
now, he said.
   Many details of the reunion haven't been worked out, Trucks said.
But he added, ``From talking to Dickey, Gregg and Jaimoe,
everybody's excited about it. It should be fun.''
   The band originally consisted of brothers Duane and Gregg Allman,
Jaimoe, Trucks and bassist Berry Oakley.
   Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident in October 1971, and
Oakley died in a similar wreck a year later. Keyboard player Chuck
Leavell later joined the group as did bassist Lamar Williams.
Williams died of cancer in 1983.

   Former major-leaguer Steve Garvey probably
will continue to have a junior high school named after him, despite
recent allegations that he may have sired two illegitimate children.
   Lincoln Junior High in the town of Lindsay was renamed Steve
Garvey Junior High in 1977, with the thinking that the then-Los
Angeles Dodgers first baseman would be a good example for teen-agers
because of his reputation for clean living.
   Last week, however, it was reported that two women have claimed
they were impregnated by Garvey, who has divorced and remarried
since the renaming.
   Garvey, 40, has said if the children are proved to be his, he
will support them.
   Lindsay Unified School District Superintendent Bob Mohr said he's
unfazed.
   ``He's really been a wonderful model for our kids, and I think a
lot of good has come out of this relationship with Steve Garvey for
our young people,'' Mohr said Friday. ``With that in mind, we're not
about to disassociate ourselves from Steve at this time.
   ``We've hung in with Steve, and it's been good for us, up to this

<HEAD>Bush Threatens Veto of Democratic Minimum Wage Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is heading toward a
confrontation with Senate Democrats over sharply differing plans to
raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage, with the possibility of the
first increase in eight years in the balance.
   ``$4.25 is it,'' Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole told Congress on
Friday, warning that President Bush would veto any attempt to fatten
the hourly increase that the administration would phase in over
three years.
   Mrs. Dole said the raise to $4.25 must also be coupled with a
sub-minimum ``training wage'' for the first six months employment
for all newly hired workers. And she would expand the current
exemption from the minimum to all small businesses.
   The Bush plan puts the administration at odds with Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, and his bill to gradually raise the minimum to $4.65 an
hour.
   There are slightly fewer than 4 million people working for the
minimum wage, according to the Labor Department.
   The $3.35 floor has not been raised since 1981. Since then, said
Kennedy, inflation has cut the purchasing power of that wage by 40
percent.
   The Labor committee will begin considering the minimum next week,
and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell says he would like to
bring it to a vote by the full Senate by the end of the month.
   But Mrs. Dole's veto warning on Friday _ what Kennedy termed a
``take it or leave it'' _ set the stage for a battle like the one
last year when Kennedy's increase failed because of opposition by
the Reagan administration.
   Mrs. Dole told the Labor panel that any rise in the minimum wage
will cost the nation jobs and that Kennedy's plan would mean 650,000
jobs lost. She said the administration's increase of 30 cents a year
for three years would balance lost jobs with higher earning power
for low-income workers.
   ``Any more expansive approach at this time would be unacceptable,
because it would decrease job opportunities,'' she told the
committee.
   ``Legislation outside those parameters would call for a veto,''
she said.
   Kennedy told Mrs. Dole that if a veto threat is part of the
administration's proposal ``then we're laying right out for a
confrontation ... I hope we're not getting a take or leave it.''
   Mrs. Dole answered, ``The president has signed up for $4.25 an
hour, and not higher.''
   ``$4.25 is it,'' she said, waving her hand.
   Under the ``training wage,'' all workers hired at the minimum
could be paid $3.35 an hour for six months before they are covered
by the higher standard, whether or not it is their first job. There
are no limits such as age on that exemption.
   The administration would also expand the tax credit for tips from
the current 40 percent to 50 percent.
   Kennedy, noting cost-of-living increases for government workers,
those in the military and others, said ``those at the end of the
economy ought to get it, too.''
   The administration proposal was attacked by the business
community after the committee hearing.
   ``A higher minimum wage would deny access to the first rung on
America's job ladder or those entering the work force _ the very
people the increase is meant to help,'' said Robert L. Martin,
director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's employee relations policy
center.

   Discovery and its crew of five
astronauts are scheduled to lift off March 11 on the first of seven
shuttle flights set for 1989.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration selected the
date Friday following a two-day review of the mission. Liftoff was
set for 8:10 a.m. EST.
   ``Our launch teams are not working any significant issues which
are expected to impact a launch next week,'' said Adm. Richard
Truly, NASA's associate administrator for space flight, who directed
the review.
   The mission will be the third for the shuttle program since the
explosive loss of Challenger and its seven astronauts more than
three years ago.
   Discovery made the first post-Challenger flight last September
and was followed by an Atlantis flight in December.
   The latest launch originally was scheduled Feb. 18, but technical
problems forced a series of delays.
   Discovery's crew, headed by commander Michael Coats, is to deploy
a large communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments
during five days in orbit.
   Also on board will be astronauts John Blaha, James Bagian, James
Buchli and Bob Springer.

<HEAD>Man Defense Calls Mentally Retarded Given Stay of Execution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday blocked the
execution of a man after a defense attorney argued that the
condemned man was mentally retarded and did not understand his
rights when he was arrested.
   Barry Lee Fairchild, 34, was scheduled to die by injection on
Wednesday for the 1983 beating, rape and murder of a 22-year-old
nurse. U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Eisele ordered the stay after a
two-hour hearing.
   Defense attorney John Wesley Hall cited intelligence tests
Fairchild had taken which indicated that his client is mentally
retarded.
   ``I knew the stay would be granted. I got the test results at 10
this morning,'' Hall said Friday.
   The attorney general's office said it would not appeal the stay
to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Eisele set a hearing for March 16 to determine if Fairchild had
the mental capacity to understand the nature of his rights and the
consequences of his action when he waived his so-called Miranda
rights after he was arrested.
   He signed and initialed the waiver, according to testimony at his
trial.
   The Miranda rights include the suspect's right to keep silent; to
be informed that anything he says may be used against him; to have
an attorney present when he is questioned by police; and to have an
attorney appointed for him free if he cannot afford to hire one.
   Questioned about what his Miranda rights were, Fairchild
described them during the hearing as ``remain silent, whatever say
can be used against you, right to call a lawyer.''
   Hall said Fairchild is easily led to give particular answers,
even though he does not realize the implications of what he is
doing. He may not realize what it means for something to be used
against him, Hall said.
   Psychologist Judy White Johnson testified for the defense that on
the basis of testing Thursday at the prison, she would place
Fairchild's IQ in the range of 56 to 64, which is considered
mentally retarded.
   The IQ statistic differs from the previous figure that was
determined after a 1986 test that said his IQ was 87, which is
dull-normal. An elementary school test given to Fairchild some 24
years ago placed his IQ at 65, Hall said.
   Eisele encouraged Hall to conduct more in-depth tests and told
the state to conduct any tests it desired.
   Fairchild was convicted in the death of Marjorie L. Mason, a
Little Rock Air Force Base nurse. She was shot twice in the back of
the head and her body was found behind an abandoned Lonoke County
farmhouse.
   Arkansas has had no execution since 1964.

   The Kremlin's offer to help cool the furor over the
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' seems a careful attempt to balance its
interests in improving relations with Iran, the West and its own
burgeoning Moslem population.
   The Soviets have defended Iran without condoning the campaign to
kill the book's author. As 15 Western nations withdrew their top
diplomats from Tehran to protest Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death
threat against Salman Rushdie, the Soviet Union edged closer to Iran
while seeking to ease the uproar.
   ``We need calm,'' Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
Thursday as he greeted his Spanish counterpart. ``The less emotion
the better for all at the present period. We have to extinguish (the
fire) because nobody needs a fire.''
   The Soviets have not revealed how the dispute could be resolved,
but with an increasingly restive Moslem population of 50 million in
Central Asia, they can ill afford a misstep.
   At first, Soviet officials declined comment on the dispute,
although Shevardnadze was then visiting the Middle East, with Iran
on his itinerary.
   Khomeini ordered his followers Feb. 14 to kill Rushdie, a
naturalized British citizen, because of his book. Moslems say the
book is blasphemous and Iranian clergymen have offered a $5.2
million bounty for Rushdie's death.
   After Shevardnadze discussed the dispute with Iranian officials
during a three-day trip to Tehran that ended Monday, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said: ``The government of
Iran is sincere about finding a settlement of the situation that has
emerged, and the Soviet Union could have a positive role to play.''
   In elaborating the Soviet Union's middle-ground position, the
official news agency Tass said Wednesday that Western countries were
justified in their ``indignation'' over Khomeini's threat.
   But, the news agency added: ``Perhaps Imam Khomeini, the supreme
religious authority in Iran, had no choice proceeding from Koran
teachings, other than denouncing a man who has insulted Islam.''
   ``The denunciation was nothing more, by the way, than the
position of a religious leader. The Iranian government has not
condemned Rushdie to death,'' Tass said, even though Iranian
officials have supported the threat.
   The sympathy toward Iran's religious concerns was unusual in
light of the Kremlin's advocacy of atheism, but reflected
sensitivity to its own Moslem population.
   The Soviet Union's Moslem population is growing much more rapidly
than ethnic Russians who hold the reins of political power. Based on
current trends, the Moslem population will rise to 100 million by
the year 2000, meaning one in every three Soviets will be a Moslem.
   Soviet Moslems were unhappy when the Red Army moved into
neighboring Afghanistan in 1979 to fight Moslem rebels. Siding with
the West in the Rushdie dispute would have angered Soviet Moslems
further at a time when they are becoming increasingly vocal.
   On Feb. 3, Moslems massed in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent to
demand the ouster of their religious leader because, they said, he
was not following religious law and was a pawn of the state. He
later resigned and Moslems are to choose a new leader March 14-15.
   In other signs of new sensitivity to Moslems, the government has
promised to open more mosques and expand an Islamic seminary.
   After Shevardnadze's meetings in Tehran, the Kremlin sought to
play down Khomeini's death threat even though the United States had
asked him to ``raise concerns with the Iranians'' and Britain urged
him to press Iran to back off.
   For Moscow, however, further improving relations with Tehran
carried the day. Iran once lumped the Soviet Union and the United
States together as ``The Great Satan.'' In a sign of the changing
times, Shevardnadze became the highest ranking Soviet to visit Iran
since its 1979 Islamic revolution.
   The Soviet Union's relations with Iran have improved markedly
since it began allowing Moslems more religious freedom and
withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan.
   Iran, gratified by the Afghan pullout, signed an agreement in
December to supply the Soviets with natural gas. Trade is growing
between the countries, and the Soviet Union is helping rebuild areas
of Iran devastated in its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   Aside from bringing it closer to Iran, the Soviet offer of
mediation in the Rushdie affair serves a wider foreign policy goal.
It is in line with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``new political
thinking,'' which seeks to avoid confrontation and stresses
compromise and cooperation.
   The Soviet tabloid Arguments and Facts said Friday the affair
opens a peacemaking opportunity for the Soviet Union. ``In such
cases, more than ever, assistance is needed from a party that can
take a sober view of things, to help both sides get out of the
difficult situation they created,'' the newspaper said.
   Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, who met
Thursday in Moscow with Shevardnadze, said the Kremlin mediation
effort had not yet begun.
   ``There was no proposal concerning an intermediary role,'' he
said Friday.
   Shevardnadze is slated to discuss the issue next week in Vienna
with British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe and U.S. Secretary
of State James A. Baker III.

<BYLINE>Eds: Subs grafs 3-4 to update with picket lines up and CORRECT

<TEXT>
   Union mechanics and baggage handlers struck
Eastern Airlines at midnight Friday after President Bush refused to
order an emergency 60-day cooling-off period and union officials
rejected a last-ditch company proposal.
   Negotiations continued up to the deadline. But shortly after
midnight, federal mediator Walter C. Wallace told reporters, ``We
have not been successful in reaching agreement.
   ``Eastern Airlines is officially on strike as of midnight,'' said
Charles Bryan, president of Eastern Machinists District 100. ``It's
shut down.''
   PIcket lines went up around the country and pilots immediately
pledged to support the strike.
   ``We voted unanimously to honor the picket lines,'' said Jack
Bavis of the Air Line Pilots Association. ``That means as far as I'm
concerned the Eastern pilots are directed as of this moment not to
fly Eastern airplanes.''
   Tom Matthews of Eastern blamed the strike on the union's
insistence on an 8 percent increase when the airline's others unions
accepted a 20 percent wage cut three years ago.
   ``This has to do with a union that has decided that it is not
going to join with the other employees at Eastern who have made the
sacrifices they've made,'' he said.
   Matthews said Eastern would continue flying, albeit at a reduced
schedule that he said was set to ``make sure people could have
continued confidence in Eastern.''
   The strike was called after Eastern made a new offer to the union
that company officials said protected past wage increases and job
security for 8,500 union aircraft mechanics and baggage handlers.
   Wallace, chairman of the National Mediation Board, said the talks
between the two sides ended on a ``professional if not cordial''
note and that both sides were free to resume negotiations at any
time.
   Bush, in an unprecedented action, earlier Friday had rejected a
recommendation from federal mediators to order an emergency 60-day
cooling-off period. Thirty-three senators and national labor leaders
also had urged him to name an emergency panel, a move that would
have averted a strike for at least 60 days.
   The financially strapped airline said it opposed federal
intervention.
   Details of the company's last offer were not disclosed, although
George Brennan, an Eastern vice president, said it ``addresses the
(union) concerns.'' The union earlier Friday rejected a company
proposal that would have cut mechanics' pay by 15 percent and
baggage handlers' wages by 26 percent.
   A federal judge, meanwhile, ruled that Eastern machinists could
set up pickets against other airlines, but he prohibited Machinists
union members at those airlines from joining the strike. AFL-CIO
officials had said members of all unions should honor the secondary
pickets.
   Wallace, speaking to reporters outside a hotel where talks were
under way, said of Eastern's initial offer Friday, ``The other side
evaluated it and rejected it... It was a fizzle.''
   Eastern on Thursday had offered to reduce the size of the wage
takebacks it has been demanding for the past 17 months from 8,500
members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers.
   The first offer Friday would have reduced hourly top-scale wages
from $18.83 to $16 for aircraft mechanics and from $15.60 to $11.54
for baggage handlers.
   In a non-strike action that could put pressure on all the
nation's airlines, the Air Line Pilots Association announced that in
the event of an Eastern strike, it would instruct its 40,000 members
beginning next Tuesday to precisely adhere to flying procedures that
would cause ``substantial delays'' at the nation's airport.
   Eastern said it would operate despite a walkout in an effort to
trim by $150 million a year the wages paid to members of the
Machinists union.
   Bush, in a statement released at the White House, said, ``The
National Mediation Board has for many months attempted
unsuccessfully to bring the parties to an agreement, and I have no
reason to believe that an additional investigation or the 60-day
delay that would be entailed would produce such an agreement.''
   He warned union officials against ``disrupting the nation's
transportation systems through secondary boycotts'' against other
airlines or transportation companies.
   Bush said that if strikes against other transportation outlets
occur, he will seek emergency legislation to stop them.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told a news conference
Friday that Federal Aviation Administration inspections of Eastern
were already being increased.
   ``Eastern's service will be on planes that are safe and
airworthy, and ... we will not tolerate any threats of sabotage or
other forms of physical harm that threaten the health and safety of
people on the ground or in the air,'' Skinner said.
   The union has said it has no plans for any such actions or
threats.
   Skinner said, in answer to a question, that Bush retained the
power to call the emergency panel and prevent a strike _ even after
the deadline _ but he indicated that was unlikely.
   Congress could also invoke the emergency panel provision of the
act. A panel would examine the dispute for 30 days and report to the
president. A 30-day cooling-off period would follow before the
company or union could take any action affecting jobs.
   Eastern had said earlier that either a strike, if it involved
pilots, or presidential intervention delaying the strike, would
likely lead to bankruptcy. The company, which flies 100,000
passengers a day with more than 1,000 flights, says it is losing $1
million a day and has lost $1 billion over the past decade.
   Pilots and flight assistants have said they will refuse to work
behind Machinists picket lines.
   As the strike deadline approached, Eastern sent Machinists union
members home for a paid vacation day. The airline acted after
telling a federal judge that the union planned last-minute sabotage
that threatened passenger safety.
   ``This is not a lockout and is not an attempt to affect the
bargaining,'' said airline spokesman Joe Leonard.
   In U.S. District Court in Washington, Judge John H. Pratt said he
was ruling that Machinists union members at other airlines could not
honor Eastern machinists' picket lines there ``in view of the fact
that there are no-strike clauses, no-slowdown clauses'' in their
contracts with the other airlines.
   During the hearing, the attorney for USAir and Piedmont Airlines,
Thomas Reinnert said the two airlines ``are total strangers to the
dispute ... and we want to keep it that way.''
   Also included at the hearing were representatives of Northwest
Airlines, TWA and United Airlines.

   The Secret Service is having a difficult time
recruiting minority group members because it can't keep up with
salaries offered elsewhere, the agency's director says.
   ``If I were a minority getting out of college, I would be heavily
recruited by Xerox and IBM and all the major corporations,'' Secret
Service Director John R. Simpson told the Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government on
Friday.
   And the problem isn't just limited to minority recruitment, he
said.
   ``We're offering $18,000 to incoming agents,'' Simpson said.
``The Los Angeles Police Department is starting in the vicinity of
$33,000.''
   One agent who had been with the Secret Service for three years
recently left to take a job with the Suffolk County police force in
New York, where he'll earn $55,000 a year, Simpson said.
   ``You train them for other places,'' said Sen. Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md. ``You're the farm team.''
   The Treasury Department agency which protects the president, the
vice president and presidential candidates, among others, will face
a crisis when the next president campaign rolls around, Simpson said.
   ``In 1992, when one-third to one-quarter of our law enforcement
personnel will be eligible to retire, the potential applicant pool
of men and women between the ages of 21 and 30 will be at its lowest
point since World War II,'' Simpson said. ``Without the ability to
attract and retain their replacements now, the future of our
operations is very seriously threatened.''
   Secret Service uniformed officers, whose jobs don't require
college education, begin at $23,000, but their salaries can't
eventually increase as much as those of actual agents, who must have
college degrees, Simpson said in an interview after the hearing.
There are about 1,950 agents and 1,000 uniformed officers in the
Secret Service.
   Stephen E. Higgins, director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, indicated his bureau faces the same situation because
of starting salaries of $15,000 to $18,000.
   Ms. Mikulski noted: ``They start at the same level as a paralegal
in the office of attorneys defending the drug dealers.''
   The National Advisory Commission on Law Enforcement, a panel
created at the urging of subcommittee chairman Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., is considering calling for salary increases for the
officers, the senator said.
   Such a decision would have to be made by Congress, so the budget
requests for the agencies for fiscal 1990, the topic of the
subcommittee hearing, did not include money for increasing salaries.
   The Secret Service request for fiscal 1990 is $368.4 million, an
increase of $10.9 million over 1989.
   DeConcini noted that in the year after a presidential election,
``historically, your budget requests are down.''
   Asked why the budget request had increased this year, Simpson
said some of the campaign protection funds for last year's election
had been distributed to the agency in advance of fiscal 1989, and
the elimination of non-recurring costs was not enough to offset
inflation.
   ``In order to stay ahead of the bad guys, you have got to have
some flexibility in the budget,'' Simpson said.
   The ATF bureau did not include a specific budget request during
the hearing.

   Congress set the first national minimum wage at
40 cents an hour in 1938 with the Fair Labor Standards Act.
   Since then, lawmakers have passed six amendments to the act,
raising the minimum, the last time in 1977 when Congress decided to
raise the level gradually over four years to $3.35, the current mark.
   Here is a list of the increases:
   1938 _ $0.40.
   1949 _ $0.75.
   1955 _ $1.00.
   1961 _ $1.15.
   1963 _ $1.25.
   1966 _ $1.40.
   1967 _ $1.60.
   1974 _ $2.00.
   1975 _ $2.10.
   1976 _ $2.30.
   1978 _ $2.65.
   1979 _ $2.90.
   1980 _ $3.10.
   1981 _ $3.35.
   Twelve states and the District of Columbia have raised the
minimum wage in laws that take precedence over the federal standard
inside their borders, according to the Labor Department. California
and Connecticut have the highest minimum at $4.25 an hour, although
D.C. has a $4.85 floor for some workers.
   The other states with minimums higher than the federal government
are Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Bush's statement
Friday on the Eastern Airlines situation.
   The National Mediation Board has recommended that I appoint an
emergency board before March 4, pursuant to section 10 of the
Railway Labor Act, as amended, to investigate the dispute between
Eastern Airlines and the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers. I have decided not to accept this recommendation.
   The National Mediation Board has for many months attempted
unsuccessfully to bring the parties to an agreement, and I have no
reason to believe that an additional investigation, or the 60-day
delay that would be entailed, would produce such an agreement.
   In light of the well-publicized threats of a strike and related
activities, the Department of Transportation will monitor the
situation and will in addition take whatever steps are needed to
protect the safety of the traveling public.
   I urge responsible labor officials not to try to influence
resolution of this dispute by disrupting the nation's transportation
systems through secondary boycotts against uninvolved parties. Such
boycotts would unfairly burden millions of citizens, not only
preventing necessary travel, but also affecting shipment of consumer
goods and the ability of many workers to earn a living. For these
reasons, secondary boycotts are not permitted in any other sector of
the economy.
   Accordingly, if secondary boycotts threaten to disrupt essential
transportation services, I will submit, and urge that Congress
promptly enact, legislation making it unlawful to use secondary
picketing and boycotts against neutral carriers. We cannot allow an
isolated labor-management dispute to disrupt the nation's entire
transportation system.

   A laser weapon shot down a supersonic target
last week in a test that the Navy hailed as proof the experimental
weapons can be used against cruise missiles.
   The service said Friday the classified test was conducted Feb. 23
at the White Sands, N.M., Missile Range using a laser that is being
tested both by the Navy and the ``Star Wars'' program.
   The test was an extremely important one, the Navy said, because
``for the first time a high-energy laser system successfully engaged
and destroyed a ... missile flying low and fast in a cruise missile
profile.''
   Never before had the laser been tested against a target flying
faster than the speed of sound, the Navy said.
   The laser ``destroyed a supersonic missile in a test designed to
show that a laser system could acquire, track and deposit enough
energy on a supersonic target to destroy it,'' the Navy continued.
   At the same time, the Navy released an unclassified videotape of
the experiment. The tape shows the target missile flying across the
desert floor, then just a brief, sharp burst of light near its tip
that sends it out of control.
   The laser used in the test, nicknamed MIRACL for Mid-Infrared
Advanced Chemical Laser, proved for the first time in the fall of
1987 that it could shoot down a target flying below the speed of
sound. A jet-powered drone was used in those tests.
   In the latest experiment, the laser was fired against an old
TALOS anti-aircraft missile that was flying more than two times the
speed of sound _ or roughly 1,500 miles per hour _ on a path meant
to simulate that of an attacking cruise missile, the Navy said.
   Unlike the Star Wars organization, which has been investigating
the feasibility of laser weapons to shoot down ballistic nuclear
missiles in space, the Navy has been experimenting with MIRACL to
see if such a laser could reliably defend a warship against missile
attack.
   The Navy program is known as the Balanced Technology Initiative.

   Airports, railroads and seaports nationwide braced
Friday as Eastern Airlines' Machinists went on strike, a walkout
that threatened secondary action against the nation's transportation
system.
   Airports that handle heavy Eastern traffic boosted police
patrols, designated picket areas and mapped contingency plans to
keep operations running normally after the Machinists went on strike
at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.
   Machinists quickly established that they intended to shut Eastern
down, storming the gate at Miami International Airport. Police in
riot gear helped push them back.
   At approximately 12:10 a.m., the 3,400 Eastern pilots voted
overwhlemingly to honor the Machinists strike.
   J. B. ``Skip'' Stokes, spokesman for Eastern members of the Air
Line Pilots Association said early Saturday: ``We will honor their
picket.''
   Referring to the pilots who don't honor the picket line, he said
``a shadow would be cast over them for perhaps the rest of their
careers at Eastern.''
   Negotiations between the airline and Eastern collapsed despite an
undisclosed offer by the carrier at 10 p.m., two hours before the
deadline, and Machinists' officials offering to extend talks at the
mediators' request.
   Defensive activities were especially evident at airports in south
Florida, the Miami-based Eastern's home region. Security also was
beefed up at many airports, including Atlanta, Washington, Seattle,
Philadelphia and Newark, N.J.
   Preparations took on new urgency Friday afternoon when President
Bush announced he would not intervene in the bitter labor dispute _
an action that would have stalled a strike by triggering a 60-day
cooling-off period.
   Eastern cut up to three-quarters of its weekend flights on
Friday, including most out of its Atlanta hub and nearly 60 other
cities. The airline planned to maintain service to almost 50 cities,
including most flights out of Miami and on Eastern's Northeast
shuttle and Latin American routes.
   Other carriers moved in to pick up some of the slack.
   Pan American World Airways said it would add two or three flights
per hour on its shuttle service from New York to both Boston and
Washigton.
   Delta Air Lines said it would consider adding flights from
Eastern's Atlanta hub to Florida and from Northeast points south. It
planned to honor Eastern tickets, with certain conditions.
   Continental Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines said
they would honor some Eastern tickets but planned no additional
service.
   Greyhound Lines said it planned expanded bus service beginning
Monday.
   Amtrak said it would add 12 daily trains between New York and
Washington. In the event of a secondary strike, the rail line said
it would attempt skeleton service run by supervisors. Amtrak carries
33,000 passengers on 108 trains a day in the Northeast corridor and
28,000 daily passengers elsewhere.
   In Washington, the head of Amtrak said the national passenger
railroad could continue limited operations for only a few days if
picketed by workers supporting an Eastern strike.
   A recording on a Amtrak station telephone line in Providence,
R.I., said, ``The effect of an Eastern strike is uncertain. Our
current plans are to operate a normal schedule.'' The recording
began by stating that lines were tied up because of the anticipated
strike.
   National union leaders and locals threatened to disrupt
transportation around the country in sympathy with the Eastern
Machinists.
   In Newark, Gene Hoffman, general chairman of District 100 of the
Machinists, said there was a ``good possibility'' union members at
Trans World Airlines, United Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and USAir
would strike if the Eastern Machinists walked out.
   In metropolitan New York, freight railroads and commuter lines
that carry about 320,000 people into Manhattan each day expected to
be hit by a secondary strike.
   ``It looks like a very bad situation,'' said Robert Kiley,
chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, parent agency
of the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
   Extra buses were ordered to shuttle passengers from outlying
suburbs in western Connecticut and the northern suburbs to subway
terminals in the Bronx and Queens.
   The Long Island Rail Road established telephone hotlines to help
commuters find alternative routes and subway connections. The city
Department of Transportation said it would put extra traffic agents
at busy intersections and activate all tow trucks to deal with an
anticipated surge in traffic.
   At the port of Miami, port officials and cruise line
representatives made contingency plans for an estimated 8,000 to
10,000 booked passengers who would be unable to get to cruise ships
or return home if Eastern flights were disrupted.
   At Miami International Airport, adjacent to Eastern's corporate
headquarters, extensive preparations were made to maintain airport
operations and ``protect the public's right of access to the
airport,'' said Dade County Aviation Department spokeswoman Amalia
Fernandez.
   ``Things are very quiet right now,'' she said Friday afternoon.
``The airport is operating. We have increased police presence as
planned, the staffing is increased in all areas and will continue
throughout the weekend until we see what happens,'' said Ms.
Fernandez.
   In Atlanta, Eastern's second-largest operating location with
6,700 employees, picket lines went up outside the Eastern
maintenance hangar after machinists were sent home with pay and the
gate to the maintenance area was locked. Union members set up a
strike tent across the street from the gate and police set up
barricades nearby.

   The Shoreham nuclear power plant could have
an operating license in about a month, the chairman of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said after the commission ejected the affected
state and local governments from its proceedings.
   The commission voted 4-0 Friday to remove the governments of New
York state, Suffolk County and the Town of Southampton on the
grounds they ``willfully defied'' commission orders to produce
documents and witnesses at licensing hearings. The federal action
was unprecedented in more than 30 years of overseeing the nuclear
industry.
   NRC Chairman Lando Zech said there are no further roadblocks to
licensing the $5.4 billion plant on New York's Long Island. ``If
everything were to go well, I suppose in a month would be the
earliest'' for licensing, he said.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo vowed an appeal in federal court.
   ``The Nuclear Regulatory Commission seeks to deny the state and
local governments our statutory right to protect the health and
safety of our citizens,'' he said in a statement. ``The NRC's
position is absurd.''
   Officials of the Long Island Lighting Co., which owns the plant,
were predictably pleased by the NRC decision.
   ``The NRC has proclaimed clearly and definitely that Shoreham is
a safe plant,'' said LILCO spokesman Joseph McDonnell.
   LILCO and Cuomo announced Feb. 28 they had reached an agreement
under which the utility would sell the plant to the state for $1 and
it would be dismantled by the state power authority.
   In return, LILCO would be eligible for rate increases which have
yet to be specified. Friday's ruling has clearly put LILCO in a
better position to hold out for the highest rate increases it can
get under the shut-down agreement.
   LILCO has also retained the right to continue seeking an
operating license but agreed not to operate the plant even if one is
granted, as long as all necessary approvals of the pact are in place
by April 15.
   The state and local governments had stalled licensing of the
reactor by refusing to participate in an emergency evacuation plan.
They contended that the area around the Long Island plant could not
be evacuated in the event of an accident.

<HEAD>Officials Say Nuclear Reactor Mishap Won't Delay Restart Plans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators of a nuclear weapons plant
accident in South Carolina have concluded that measures needed to
prevent a recurrence will not delay plans for resuming production
there of a radioactive gas used in nuclear warheads.
   The investigators, in a report released by the Energy Department
on Friday, blamed the Jan. 22 accident on ``significant and
longstanding weaknesses'' in operations at the Savannah River Plant,
which includes three nuclear reactors.
   The reactors are owned by the Energy Department and run by a
private contractor.
   The report said the troubles at Savannah River's K reactor, where
the accident occurred, are symptomatic of problems throughout the
complex that must be corrected before the reactors resume production
of tritium, a gas needed in the manufacture of American nuclear arms.
   All three reactors have been shut down since last spring,
crippling the nuclear weapons production program. A restart of the K
reactor has been planned for late this year, with the two other
reactors to resume operation in 1990.
   There had been concern that the Jan. 22 accident might delay the
restart schedule. The Energy Department has said that unless tritium
production were resumed by the end of the year, the nation's nuclear
arsenal could be put in jeopardy.
   ``We do not see any significant schedule delay as a result of
this,'' Leonard C. Sjostrom, an Energy Department health and safety
official said in a telephone interview from Savannah River. He was
one of the official investigators.
   Sjostrom said the department still expected to announce a
specific restart schedule for the K reactor sometime this month. He
said he could not be more specific.
   The Energy Department report said operators of the reactor and
its support systems were unprofessional and lacking in discipline.
It blamed their managers for this.
   The conclusions of the 131-page report go to the heart of safety,
technical and managerial problems at Savannah River that have
virtually shut down the complex.
   Several valves in K reactor's backup cooling system were damaged
in the accident, but because there was no fuel in the reactor, the
health and safety of plant workers and the general public were not
in danger, the report said.
   The problem began when a pipe valve was inadvertently left open
before the start of the cooling system test. This prevented the
usual buildup of pressure in the pipes during the test. Instead of
halting operations to determine the cause of the problem, du Pont
technicians pumped more water into the pipes. This caused the open
valve to slam shut with extraordinary force, creating what is called
a ``water hammer'' that damaged several other valves.
   A final assessment of the extent of damage has not yet been
completed, officials said.
   The investigators' report was strongly critical of the E. I. du
Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. management team that runs the reactor complex
under an Energy Department contract. It also criticized plant
operators and Energy Department officials on the site.
   ``The investigative team reached a consensus that this event was
a direct result of significant and longstanding weaknesses that
continue to exist in the conduct of plant operations,'' the report
said.
   The investigators cited du Pont's initial report of the incident,
which happened on a Sunday. The company's report was a routine
accounting of what had taken place at the plant over the weekend. It
said there had been ``no incidents,'' while later mentioning the
reactor accident only briefly.
   The du Pont report included 10 ``events.'' Listed ahead of the
reactor accident were such things as the spilling of one quart of
diesel fuel and an operator falling off his chair.

   The smell got to be so bad that the lawyers stopped taking new
cases and officials closed the office.
   County officials now have decided to bulldoze the infested
trailer and bring in a new trailer, said Carl Holmes, the chief
deputy public defender.
   ``A happy lawyer is a rat-free lawyer,'' Holmes said. ``It'll be
nice to get back to the business of representing our clients.''

   Skinheads and white supremacists refused to
back down from a rally on a private ranch today, but they abandoned
plans for a whites-only ``Aryan Woodstock'' rock concert that a
judge said required a permit.
   ``We can sing, we just can't play instruments,'' said Bob Heick,
the San Francisco head of a white supremacist group called American
Front who represented concert organizers in court Friday.
   ``I'm not angry,'' he said. ``I expected this, obviously.''
   Napa County Superior Court Judge W. Scott Snowden, describing the
issue as ``politically and emotionally charged,'' deemed the event a
public gathering. He issued a restraining order prohibiting the
concert because organizers had failed to obtain a permit required by
county ordinance.
   But Snowden allowed a public gathering, rejecting the county's
argument that the assembly would be a public nuisance and saying it
``demonstrated no clear and present danger to the public.''
   Six skinheads linked arms around Heick and escorted him out of
the courthouse, using lighted cigarettes to make their way through a
throng of reporters. Heick vowed to ``get a concert going''
elsewhere.
   Leaders of the groups said they would gather today to party and
discuss their ``white liberation movement.'' The site is a private
ranch about 40 miles north of San Francisco.
   The physican who owns the land and leased it for the gathering
said he was told the meeting was to be about environmental concerns.
   The skinhead subculture and style of dress emerged in London in
the 1960s. Segments of the movement later took on Nazi overtones and
since have been associated with the white supremacist groups.
   County attorney Robert Westmeyer said the ruling didn't surprise
him, adding that it might prompt the county Board of Supervisors to
change the law.
   ``I think (they) may consider revising the ordinance to apply to
large public gatherings, rather than just rock concerts,'' he said.
   Before the hearing, an NAACP official warned that the gathering
was an effort to win support for an unpopular cause which advocates
racial violence.
   However, Regional Director James L. Martin said the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People would not
``dignify the existence of this group or their planned event with
our presence tommorrow.''
   ``We can ignore a rock concert by skinheads, but we cannot ignore
what they represent in terms of potential danger,'' he added.
   The Jewish Defense League and the anti-crime Guardian Angels
civilian patrol group indicated they would demonstrate at the rally.
   Heick, who sports 16 tattoos, including SKINS inked inside his
lower lip, said during Friday's hearing that, ``Our intention was to
comply with the law.'' He said a check with the county some time ago
indicated no permit was needed.
   ``In no way would we want a public event,'' he said. ``We wanted
to keep out of people's way, where we could all be alone and have a
little party.''
   The concert was to feature skinhead bands Midtown Boot Boys from
Oklahoma, the Hammerheads from Wisconsin and Hakenkreuz from Detroit.
   Organizer Tom Metzger, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and currently
head of a group called White Aryan Resistance, argued earlier that
since the concert was to be held on private property and admission
was by invitation only, no permit was needed.
   Although Metzger earlier had predicted as many as 2,000 people
might attend the concert, Heick on Friday said he expected about 200
attendees.

<TEXT>
   Angry Eastern Airlines Machinists screamed ``On
strike!'' an some stormed company gates Saturday after rejecting a
final contract offer and starting a walkout that immediately began
to frustrate air traffic nationwide.
   ``The strike is on,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said just
after 12:01 a.m. EST. The financially troubled carrier's pilots and
flight attendants joined the strike which President Bush refused to
halt by invoking emergency powers.
   ``It's the most overwhelming support I have seen in the history
of the labor movement,'' said Machinists union local President
Charles Bryan after federally mediated talks collapsed in Washington
and unionists threw up pickets.
   The walkout instantly disrupted Easter flights at Miami, the
airline's headquarters. One of the first Eastern post-strike
flights, about to depart for Puerto Rico, was canceled after the
flight crew walked out at midnight.
   ``They say there's another Eastern flight,'' said passenger Ron
Adams, 51. ``But I'm going to try to get my ticket endorsed for
another airline. I've been traveling for 3{ days and I'm too tired
to wait around.''
   From Atlanta to Los Angeles, carloads of pickets careened into
airports by the midnight deadline, reporters for The Associated
Press in those areas said.
   At Newark, N.J., an important Eastern hub, the last Eastern
flight arrived at 11:57 p.m. from Tampa, Fla. and passengers were
clearly relieved. Three others scheduled to San Juan, Atlanta and
Ford Lauderdale were cancelled.
   The strike capped an emotional 17-month feud between the union
and Eastern that has come to symbolize the problems faced by one of
the nation's largest and most unprofitable airlines.
   In Miami, about 3,000 workers charged across the street from the
local union hall to corporate headquarters, chanting and carrying
placards. Some hurled rocks, bottles and concrete blocks over the
barbed wire-topped fence.
   They tore up effigies of Texas Air Corp. chairman Frank Lorenzo,
the hard-line boss who bought Eastern three years ago.
   Riot police turned back some workers who tried to storm Eastern
gates. Matell said some union members apparently did crash through
gates, but he had no details.
   ``Estamos en huelga! (We are on strike!),'' shouted union local
aide Marty Urra, speaking in Spanish. Later, he added: ``It's a
shame. It could have been avoided.''
   Police cars with sirens screaming and some officers in riot gear
took their places at Miami's airport and Eastern implemented strike
contingency plans it said could keep the carrier flying
``indefinitely.''
   Matell said a proposal made less than two hours before the strike
deadline guaranteed job security for the 8,500-member union. But
union members said the company offered scant improvements over its
demand for $150 million in wage concessions.
   Wally Haber, a Machinists general chairman, reported strong
support from Eastern's pilots and flight attendants and predicted
support from other unions across the nation.
   ``It's no longer a fight between Machinists and Eastern. It's a
fight between labor and corporate America,'' Haber said.
   In a related action, the Airline Pilots Association announced its
40,000 members next Tuesday would begin to precisely follow flying
procedures, causing ``substantial'' airport delays.
   The AFL-CIO has urged all members to honor picket lines and the
Machinists have vowed to picket trains, ports and other airlines.
   Joseph Leonard, Eastern's chief operating officer, said the
carrier slashed weekend flights by up to 75 percent but could keep
flying. Service will be maintained to about 50 cities, including
most flights from Miami and on the airline's Northeast shuttle and
Latin American routes, he said.
   In Washington, U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt ruled that
Machinists at other airlines could not honor Eastern machinists'
picket lines in view of no-strike, no-slowdown clauses'' in their
contracts with other carriers.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told a news conference the
Transportation Department ``will monitor the situation and will, in
addition, take whatever steps are needed to protect the safety of
the traveling public.''
   Eastern said it had contracted with 1,100 non-union mechanics to
service its planes. Leonard said Eastern could fly indefinitely with
200 management pilots and those who cross picket lines if pilots
honor a walkout.
   Leonard told reporters in Miami the Machinists were sent home
early in the day after a federal judge said it was necessary to
ensure passenger safety. He denied it was a lockout move.
   Bush's refusal to invoke an emergency mediation panel and impose
a 60-day cooling-off period in the 17-month-old dispute marked his
first major labor-crisis decision.
   To Eastern's machinists it signaled a major dimming of hope.
``The reaction here is we would just as soon get it over with,''
said Rick Iacino, a Machinists general chairman. ``Our people are
pumped up; they're ready. War has been declared.''
   The airline, which says it is losing $1 million a day, has been
seeking $150 million in concessions from the Machinists, the union
that includes mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground workers.
   Eastern flies about 100,000 people a day with an average of 1,040
daily flights. It has 250 airliners.
   The 60-year-old, Miami-based carrier, owned by Texas Air Corp.,
wanted Bush to stay out of the dispute, claiming it could not afford
any delay.
   Eastern's pilots rejected an appeal Thursday by Lorenzo for them
to sign a new contract and cross Machinists picket lines.
   Eastern flight attendants said they would honor picket lines,
although Lorenzo _ who in 1983 took Continental Airlines into
bankruptcy reorganization to end a labor confrontation _ has warned
that the action could land Eastern ``in the corporate graveyard.''
   Airports nationwide strengthened security and made contingencies
for dealing with the strike. Other airlines, some of which have
declined to promise to honor Eastern tickets, have reported surges
in sales this week.
   ``We will do our best to assist Eastern passengers should there
be a work stoppage,'' stated Delta Air Lines, which arranged to
accept Eastern tickets.
   Leonard said the company had experienced ``significant amounts of
vandalism'' and got permission from U.S. District Judge C. Clyde
Atkins in Miami to send workers home. Atkins said it was necessary
for passenger safety.
   Workers were given a paid holiday and told to report back to work
at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, one minute after the strike deadline,
Leonard said.
   Leonard said the company had reliable information that Machinists
planned at midnight to deploy emergency chutes on all Eastern
planes, threatening equipment and causing lengthy flight delays.
   Frank Ortis, Machinists Local 702 vice president, denied the
claim.
   ``Our people are professionals. There is no sabotage,'' Ortis
said while hundreds of union members wearing black T-shirts, some
with skull-and-crossbones warnings to ``scab'' strike replacement
workers, awaited news at the local union near Eastern corporate
headquarters.
   The company contended that Machinists set at least four fires in
recent days at Miami International Airport and Atlanta's Hartsfield
International Airport. Atkins ruled there was ``credible evidence''
that at least one fire was set by Machinists, beneath a concourse at
Miami International.
   The Machinists vowed to picket other airlines, ships and
railroads, and AFL-CIO officials have said they want their 14
million members to support the Eastern Machinists.
   In St. Paul, Minn., a federal judge on Thursday issued an order
barring Northwest Airlines' 21,000-member Machinists' union from
staging a sympathy strike in the event of a walkout, pending a March
13 hearing.

<TEXT>
   The United States and other Western
nations are putting together emergency loans to help Venezuela
weather an economic crisis that sparked nationwide riots and the
deaths this week of at least 300 people.
   President Carlos Andres Perez on Friday linked the bloodiest
civil unrest in Venezuela's history to the burden of its foreign
debt. He said debt payments threaten the newest democracies in Latin
America.
   He accused foreign debtors of inflexibility by demanding
repayment of the region's $420 billion foreign debt without regard
to a nation's ability to pay. Venezuela owes international banks and
lenders $33 billion _ fourth largest in Latin America after Brazil,
Mexico and Argentina.
   ``I hope this painful sacrifice by our country will serve for the
leaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are not
exaggerating when we say the crisis is serious,'' the 66-year-old
leader said.
   President Bush announced Friday that the United States would
provide Venezuela with a $450 million bridge loan to help Venezuela
meet its short-term financial needs. Spain also Friday said it would
loan Venezuela $50 million.
   U.S. officials said Bush was making the loan to help ease the
financial crisis facing Perez' month-old government.
   The loans are part of an overall package from countries including
West Germany and Japan as well as from international lenders, The
New York Times said in today's editions. Quoting government and
banking officials, it said the emergency loans will total nearly $2
billion.
   The rioting and looting in Caracas and seven other cities was
touched off by government-imposed hikes in bus fares and fuel, which
appeared to release pent-up frustration over the country's austerity
program.
   Perez on Friday confirmed at least 300 people had been killed and
2,000 injured since the unrest flared Monday. He put the number of
arrests at ``barely 1,000.''
   The Caracas daily El Nacional today quoted unofficial sources as
saying an estimated 350 to 500 people had died in four days of
rioting. The newspaper said more than 2,000 had been arrested in
Caracas.
   Curfew hours were shortened Friday from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. to 8
p.m. to 5 a.m. as the rioting ended, although early today soldiers
and police exchanged sporadic gunfire with snipers in some
low-income Caracas neighborhoods.
   The Federation of University Students said 31 people were missing
and alleged that National Guard patrols had executed people dragged
out of homes. The student group accused police of conducting
indiscriminant searches and arrests of student and labor leaders in
areas where no riots were reported.
   There was no immediate government response to the charges.
   Speaking at his news conference Friday, Perez said whether
Venezuela can continue to make principal and interest payments on
its foreign debt depends on the success of his austerity program.
   ``The crisis Latin American nations are undergoing has a name
written with capital letters _ foreign debt,'' he said. Other
nations facing similar economic crises include Argentina, where a
battle in January between rebels and the army claimed 39 lives,
Perez said.
   In a question-and-answer session with reporters, the president
appeared to indicate that Venezuela had already suspended the debt
payments.
   However, Venezuelan officials later Friday said there had been
differing interpretations of his remarks and that the payments would
be kept up at least until the end of the month.
   Perez was referring to economic austerity measures required under
an agreement with the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a
$4.3 billion loan over the next three years.
   Earlier this week, the government asked the International
Monetary Fund to include provisions allowing Venezuela to suspend
all payments on its debt until September.
   Venezuela is one of the few developing nations that has been
servicing foreign debt, Perez said, complaining that Western banks
had not recognized the effort by granting new loans.
   Oil-producing Venezuela has for decades been one of the
wealthiest and most politically stable nations in Latin America. But
a fall in world oil prices since 1981, combined with debt payments,
has depleted monetary reserves.
   Real wages have fallen by a third since 1981, and inflation is
expected to double this year to 70 percent.

<TEXT>
   The state disaster agency has declared a
drought warning for 16 eastern Pennsylvania counties in the Delaware
River basin and asked people to cut water consumption.
   Lt. Gov. Mark Singel, who chairs the state Emergency Management
Agency, said Friday the shortfall in precipitation and seriously low
reservoirs forced the action.
   ``It's good policy ... and prudent water management,'' Singel
said. ``It will go a long way to relieving a situation that may be
critical in July.''
   People in eastern Pennsylvania are urged to cut water consumption
by 10 percent by taking such steps as checking for water leaks in
their homes and curbing the use of washing machines and dishwashers.
   Singel said problems could start as early as next month if
conservation steps are not taken now. The next step would be a
drought emergency with enforced water cutbacks.
   More than 20 million people in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey
and Delaware depend upon the Delaware River for their water supply,
Singel said, and rainfall in the river's basin during the past six
months has averaged 4 to 6 inches below normal.

<HEAD>Flurry Over Report Of Tipsy Party For Intelligence Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surprise birthday party for the chief of
Israel's intelligence agency has caused a flurry, with a reported
reprimand from the prime minister and an allegation that top
security service officials got drunk.
   Parliament member Elie Ben-Menachem said he demanded an
investigation of the party for the Shin Bet chief, whose name is
kept secret. Ben-Menachem alleged the party could amount to a
security breach.
   The legislator said Friday that Arab waiters served the guests
and ``at the end of the party some of the guests got drunk, among
them senior Shin Bet officials.''
   Ben-Menachem told The Associated Press he sent a telegram to
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir demanding an investigation,
particularly on the report that Arab waiters served the party.
   ``Since the identity of the Shin Bet head is secret, this, if
proven true, could lead to a serious breach of security and to the
exposure of his identity,'' Ben-Menachem of the left-leaning Labor
Party wrote in the telegram.
   Ben-Menachem said his information was based on a ``number of
sources'' and that their reports were identical.
   Shamir, a former agent for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency,
reprimanded the Shin Bet chief for the party, the Hebrew daily
Hadashot reported.
   Despite the secrecy surrounding the security chief, Hadashot
wrote, many ministers, legislators and reporters were invited to the
surprise party to celebrate the Shin Bet chief's 45th birthday. It
was organized two weeks ago by the guest of honor's longtime
companion, a Jerusalem woman.
   The weekly magazine Yerushalaim also gave a detailed description
of the party.
   ``The Shin Bet head took his famous trumpet and gave them full
five minutes, including the inevitable `Summertime,''' it reported.
``The party lasted from 9.30 p.m. till 3 in the morning.''
   The party was held at the Israel Museum cafeteria.
   Hadashot reported that Shamir, who was an agent in Europe during
his 10 years in the Mossad, ``reacted with amazement and shock'' to
media reports describing the party.
   The prime minister's office declined comment, saying in a
statement that ``this is an issue between the prime minister and the
Shin Bet.''
   Yossi Sarid of the leftist Citizens Rights Movement said he did
not feel the party was improper.
   ``I was invited to the party and went because he is a friend of
mine,'' Sarid said. ``Nobody among the guests could cause any
damage. They all knew who the Shin Bet head is.''
   The party could prove damaging to the prestige of Shin Bet, which
has been trying to rehabilitate itself since a 1987 judicial
commission report saying agents had routinely perjured themselves in
court since 1971.
   The former Shin Bet chief, Avraham Shalom, resigned in 1986 over
a scandal involving the fatal beating during interrogation of two
Palestinian hijackers who seized an Israeli bus in April 1984. Shin
Bet agents were shown to have made up evidence to conceal their role
in the beating.

<HEAD>Protesting Nuns Ordered Out Of Convent Say They Won't Go</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five nuns protesting the
liberalization of their order plan to spend a sixth month barricaded
in their monastery unless they are convinced of the legitimacy of a
Vatican directive to stop.
   The nuns have refused since Oct. 4 to leave the monastery's
infirmary until the Vatican ruled in the dispute. The nuns said they
feared their mother superior would evict them before the Vatican had
a chance to review their case.
   A spokeswoman for the nuns said Friday they didn't believe the
ruling delivered to them by Roman Catholic Bishop Frank Rodimer of
the Paterson, N.J., diocese was legitimate and that they would
continue their protest.
   ``Nothing came here with a Vatican seal on it,'' said Betty
Sutton, the spokeswoman. ``It's the bishop's final trick to get them
out.''
   The Rev. Timothy Dolan, a spokesman for the Vatican Embassy in
Washington, said an appeal to the Vatican's highest court, the
Apostolica Signatura, could take two weeks or more to be decided.
   Two of the women whose temporary five-year vows expired during
the protest were told they must leave the Monastery of the Most
Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, the Paterson Roman Catholic
Diocese announced.
   Two others were told they should seek residence in a different
convent, and the fifth, a 71-year-old nun who suffers heart
problems, was told she would be allowed to stay at the monastery,
said Tim Manning, a spokesman for Rodimer.
   The five nuns were among 13 cloistered members of the Order of
Discalced Carmelites at the monastery.
   The nuns said they wanted the monastery returned to the
Carmelites' traditionally austere lifestyle. They had objected to
the introduction of such modern elements as television and candy.
   ``Despite the difficult situation created by some of the
religious, the fundamental principles of religious life were firmly
retained with prudence and charity,'' read the ruling from Cardinal
Jerome Hamer, the head of the Vatican Congregation for the
Religious, which oversees religious communities.
   Manning said he did not know if the five nuns would be forcibly
removed if they refused to leave.
   The mother superior, Prioress Mother Theresa Hewitt, called the
standoff a ``scandal'' when the nuns took over the infirmary and
criticized the unruly members of her order for disrupting the
cloistered lifestyle.
   Mother Hewitt and Rodimer have said the controversy centered on
the rebel nuns' inability to follow their mother superior's orders.
   Sister Eliane, a nun who has acted as a spokeswoman for those not
involved in the protest, said she had no immediate comment.
   ``Not now, not yet,'' she said, adding that the others did not
want to comment.
   Mrs. Sutton said all five women still considered themselves nuns
and part of the order and that they planned to stay until they heard
from the Vatican's highest court.
   ``We entered the monastery for a particular lifestyle, and what
these other, liberal nuns, did is change these rules,'' Sister John
of the Cross, one of the barricaded nuns whose temporary vows
expired, said in a telephone interview shortly after the nuns took
over the infirmary. ``We wouldn't be doing this unless we were
desperate.''

<TEXT>
   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry once
again is enying any involvement with drugs during his visits to a
downtown hotel after the man he went to see was arrested on drug
charges.
   The FBI annouced Friday that Charles Lewis, a central figure in a
pair of federal investigations of the mayor, was arrested in the
Virgin Islands for allegedly selling six to seven grams of cocaine
to undercover FBI agents.
   In a statement issued by his office, Barry said he was aware that
Lewis' arrest would ``raise the specter that something illegal
happened'' when Barry visited Lewis at a Ramada Inn on Dec. 22. ``I
want to repeat again that I never saw any drugs or drug
paraphernalia during my visits with Lewis.''
   A federal grand jury is investigating the circumstances
surrounding Barry's visit to the hotel in December, and a second
investigation involving both Lewis and Barry focuses on the city's
joint personnel project with the Virgin Islands.

   Detroit's two daily newspapers are free to
begin a partial merger Monday, but opponents to the business
agreement are continuing efforts to halt the merger following a
refusal by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to block the action.
   Rehnquist on Friday turned down an emergency request by attorneys
for Public Citizen, a Washington advocacy group founded by Ralph
Nader that had handled the case on behalf of opponents of the
partial merger.
   He had been asked to delay the partial merger of the Detroit Free
Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., and The Detroit News, owned by
Gannett Co. Inc., until the full Supreme Court could consider a
formal challenge.
   Public Cittizen has asked that the matter be referred to Justice
William Brennan and could ask each justice in turn to consider the
matter.
   However, Brennan, who is under no obligation to act before the
merger takes place, could shorten the process by polling the
justices himself.

<HEAD>Witness Says Hijack Defendant Directly Threatened Passengers, Crew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man accused in the 1985 hijacking of a
Jordanian airliner has for the first time been portrayed as directly
threatening the passengers and crew with death.
   A steward, Omar Suliman El Ghadi, 32, testified Friday that in
the initial moments of the hijacking Fawaz Younis ran to the front
of the Boeing 727, pounded on the locked cockpit door with his gun
and shouted, ``If you don't open the door, I will explode it.''
   El Ghadi became the fifth witness in the five-day-old trial at
U.S. District Court to identify Younis as the leader of a group. of
five heavily armed men stormed aboard Royal Jordanian Airlines
flight 402 in Beirut on June 11, 1985.
   Younis, 30, who has pleaded innocent to a six-count indictment
stemming from the hijacking, was captured by FBI agents in
international waters in the Mediterranean Sea more than two years
after the hijacking.
   The trial is seen as a test of a 1984 statute in which U.S.
authorities assert ``long-arm'' jurisdiction over the taking of
American hostages abroad.
   The prosecution rested its case late Friday, and U.S. District
Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. denied a defense motion to dismiss the
indictment.

<HEAD>Howard University President To Meet With Students on Atwater Appointment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Howard University President James Cheek is to
meet today with student representatives to discuss their grievances
in connection with the naming of Republican National Chairman Lee
Atwater as a trustee of the university.
   About 2,000 students, protesting Atwater's the selection, took
over an auditorium stage Friday and forced officials to move a
convocation including presentation of an honorary degree to comedian
Bill Cosby.
   The convocation was moved to an art gallery where there was a
brief ceremony to give Cosby an honorary degree before he left the
campus.
   ``The students at Howard University have a tradition of being
activists,'' university spokesman Alan Hermesch said later. ``When
they feel stongly about issues, they demonstrate.''
   The students said their main complaint was the school's decision
last month to name Atwater, whom they identified with controversial
ads, during George Bush's presidential campaign last year, featuring
Willie Horton, a murderer who attacked a Maryland couple while he
was on furlough from a Massachusetts prison.
   The Horton issue contributed ``to the rising anti-black sentiment
of the American people,'' said Michael Lewis, a spokesman for a
group of students who organized the protest.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Indict Business Leaders In Japanese Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today indicted four businessmen for
bribery in a stock scandal that has toppled several high-ranking
government officials and tarnished the reputation of Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita.
   Those indicted today included Hiromasa Ezoe, the 52-year-old
founder and former chairman of the Recruit Co. conglomerate, the
prosecutors' office said. Ezoe, arrested Feb. 13, is accused of
giving bribes.
   The company reportedly sold about 687,000 unlisted stocks of its
real estate subsidiary, Recruit Cosmos Co., at bargain prices to
politicians, their aides, and other prominent figures in September
1986. Purchasers made huge profits when the stocks went public and
skyrocketed in value.
   Also indicted were Ei Shikiba, 55, and Hisahiko Hasegawa, 56, two
former officials of the giant private company, Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, prosecutors said. They are accused of receiving Recruit
bribes.
   Hiroshi Kobayashi, the 43-year-old vice president of First
Finance, was also indicted for offering bribes, prosecutors said.
First Finance is a Recruit subsidiary that financed the stock sales.
   Today's indictments were the first since November, when
prosecutors indicted former Recruit official Hiroshi Matsubara for
allegedly trying to bribe an opposition lawmaker into soft-pedaling
a parliamentary investigation into the scandal.
   Since the stock scandal became public last summer, more than 10
politicians and business leaders have resigned. Among them were
three members of Takeshita's cabinet, including former Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
   Takeshita faces opposition calls in parliament to resign or
account for his links to the scandal. The parties have urged
Takeshita to submit purchase contracts and other documents for
Recruit shares allegedly held by his former secretary, Ihei Aoki,
and Katsuyuki Fukuda, a relative of Takeshita.
   NTT officials were among those who received unlisted Recruit
stocks. The telecommunications company reportedly extended special
favors to Recruit, including resale to Recruit of two U.S.-made Cray
supercomputers and the leasing of telephone lines at reduced rates.
   News reports today said NTT also has made special arrangements
for Recruit to use an emergency fast-speed digital circuit free of
charge.
   Kyodo News Service said the prosecutors will question Ezoe
further about former NTT chairman Hisashi Shinto's role in the
scandal. News reports have said Shinto met Ezoe twice in 1985 to
discuss the resale of the Cray computers.
   In the stock scandal, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is
suspected of telling NTT to buy the two supercomputers and sell them
to Recruit to benefit the company.
   Nakasone on Monday denied the charge.

<HEAD>Repatriated Vietnamese Told To Behave When They Get Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese refugees who returned to Hanoi have
been put in a transit camp and told to be sure and get along with
fellow villagers when they are allowed to go home, Hong Kong media
says.
   A chartered jet took the 46 men, 19 women and 10 children back
Thursday in the first large repatriation from Hong Kong. They were
among 11,000 Vietnamese who reached the British colony last year
after its decision that those who could not prove they fled
persecution would be regarded as illegal immigrants.
   The repatriation was arranged by Vietnam and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees after Vietnam promised not to prosecute
the returnees.
   In Bangkok, the commander of marine police acknowledged that
Thailand has been ``redirecting'' Vietnamese boat people away from
its shores for more than a year. Maj. Gen. Theerachai Reancharoen
said a boatload of 32 Vietnamese was escorted south Friday.
   Reports from Hanoi by Hong Kong's two television stations on
Friday showed the returnees housed at a spacious college an hour's
drive from the airport. Government radio said they would go home to
their villages next week.
   Television Broadcast Ltd. showed them having breakfast, and
quoted one as saying the food was better than they received in Hong
Kong. It quoted members of a family as saying they were glad to be
home and would urge friends not to leave Vietnam.
   Officials of the Vietnamese government and the U.N. refugee
agency visited the boat people Friday, the station reported.
   It said Vietnamese officials warned the boat people not to leave
illegally again and those from the United Nations promised to visit
them in their villages.
   Hong Kong radio said Nguyen Can, director of immigration at the
Vietnamese Interior Ministry, told reporters that the people who
returned earlier had caused trouble in villages.
   Asia Television Ltd., the colony's other television station,
reported that Vietnamese officials would give lectures to the
returnees on how to get along with other villagers.
   A Vietnam News Agency report Friday quoted the Foreign Ministry
as saying the repatriation ``shows our goodwill toward the first
countries of settlement which have met with difficulties caused by
illegal Vietnamese immigrants.''
   Gen. Theerachai said the boat Thailand sent away Friday was
escorted south along the coast, a route leading to Malaysia. The
Thai practice of redirecting boats to Malaysia is widely known, but
officials rarely admit it publicly.
   In a telephone interview, Theerachai said the Vietnamese sail
away voluntarily.
   ``We no longer push off boats from our shores,'' he said. ``We
just redirect the passengers to other countries that can help them
go to Australia, New Zealand and America, places where they want to
go.
   ``We provide them protection, refuel their boats, give them food,
water and medicine. That's humanitarian.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Florida Town's Voting System Discriminates Against Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has sided with blacks
who claimed that the town of Starke's at-large voting policy has
effectively shut them out of local government.
   U.S. District Judge W. Terrell Hodges, noting that the Starke
charter still contains a residential segregation clause, concluded
in his 42-page order filed Monday that blacks ``have suffered from
pervasive racial discrimination.''
   He gave each side 30 days to propose remedies.
   City Attorney Terence Brown had argued during trial in June that
the at-large system benefited all Starke residents and the north
Florida town of 5,300 people was too small to divide into districts.
   But attorneys representing a group of black residents and the
Bradford County branch of the NAACP, who filed the lawsuit in 1986,
said citywide voting for city commission members has shut out
Starke's black residents, who represent 32 percent of the voting
population.
   Hodges found that although city services have not been denied to
blacks, political opportunity has been in both elective and
appointive positions.
   ``Perhaps the clearest example of city-sponsored discrimination
can be found in the city charter of 1927,'' the judge wrote. The
provision, still on the books but not enforced for years, requires
that blacks reside in the northeast section of the town, known
locally as Reno.
   ``The lingering effects of this historical racial discrimination
are evident by the fact that blacks today continue to be segregated
by custom in the northeastern quadrant of the city,'' the judge's
order said.
   If Starke's at-large voting system is allowed to remain, it
``will continue to deny blacks equal access to the city's political
process,'' he wrote.
   Starke has held at-large elections for its five city
commissioners, one of whom serves as mayor, and for the city clerk
and police chief.
   ``We're hoping we can settle as far as drawing the lines up
without any further battle,'' said Carolyn Spooner, a member of the
Bradford County NAACP and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
   ``I would hope that both sides can sit down and work out an
agreement that is acceptable to both and get down to running city
government,'' said City Commissioner Ed Wall.
   The next local elections are scheduled for fall.

   Eastern Airlines' pledge to help passengers find
other flights was little consolation early today to thousands left
on the ground when a strike forced the airline to cut 75 percent of
its scheduled flights.
   When Harry Shafer's flight was canceled, Eastern agreed to put
him and the other members of his church group up at a hotel.
   ``They (Eastern) had a block of 30 rooms at the Holiday Inn, but
they just kept sending people out there,'' the 41-year-old DuBois,
Pa., man said. ``By the time we got out there there were none left,
people were arguing and carrying on.''
   The 8,500-member Machinist union, joined by pilots and flight
attendants, went on strike at midnight Friday in a 17-month-old wage
dispute.
   Joseph Leonard, executive vice president and chief operating
officer, said Eastern was suspending service to nearly 60 cities
today and Sunday, but added that the company has drafted an
extensive plan to keep its planes in the air throughout the strike.
   Service was to be maintained to nearly 50 cities, including
Eastern's major flights out of Miami and on its Northeast Shuttle
and South American routes, Leonard said.
   At New York's Kennedy International Airport, Alan Rosen, a
businessman from Woodmere, N.Y., arrived on an Eastern flight just
before the strike was announced and said he believed the walkout
means the end of the airline.
   ``I really think so and it's too bad,'' Rosen said after he got
off Flight 194 from West Palm Beach, which landed at 11:50 p.m., 1{
hours late.
   Leonard said most flights will be suspended at Eastern's Atlanta
hub.
   Eastern ticket offices were extending their hours to help rebook
passengers on canceled flights ``to the extent that is humanly
possible,'' Leonard said.
   Eastern's strike plans also included hiring 1,100 experienced
non-union mechanics and technicians to augment management
maintenance workers, Leonard said.
   The 3,500-member pilots union has voted to honor Machinists union
picket lines, but Leonard predicted some union pilots would cross
the picket lines.
   Only Eastern pilots would be used to fly to the planes, he said,
adding that about 200 management pilots were on call.
   The company also has nonunion employees and supervisors to fill
in for flight attendants, whose 5,900-member union said it also
would support the strike.

   A bid to take the nation's largest and
best-known legal brothel public through a $23.3 million stock
offering has become an international affair, says the head of the
company handling the sale.
   ``When you've got the most unusual offering in the history of
Wall Street, you get calls from all over the world,'' Eric Walloga,
president of the Tampa, Fla.-based American Wallstreet Securities
Inc., said Friday.
   ``Ever since we announced, we have just been swamped with calls
from Paris, Geneva, Hong Kong and Japan,'' he said. ``I had one
broker in Canada who's called in for a very, very large order.''
   Walloga represents Mustang Ranch Inc., an investors' group made
up primarily of Reno businessmen and attorneys who want to raise the
money to buy the brothel 10 miles east of Reno from owners Joe and
Sally Conforte.
   The Confortes would receive $13 million for the brothel and $5
million for promising not to set up a competing bordello, Walloga
said. The remaining $5.3 million would be used for expansion and
working capital. Prostitution is legal in most of Nevada's rural
counties.
   Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, none of the
principals in the transaction could discuss it, but Conforte has
said earlier he expected to pocket little profit because most of the
money would go directly to the government for back taxes and
interest he owes.
   ``I owe $12 million to $13 million in taxes and the capital gains
are going to be $4 million to $5 million. I'm going to do my bit to
reduce the deficit,'' said Conforte, who spent 18 months in prison
in 1984 and 1985 for failing to pay his taxes.
   Walloga said six states and the District of Columbia had approved
sales of the stock after it was accepted by the SEC.
   States where the shares are being sold are Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, New York, Connecticut and Colorado. It has not been
approved for sale in Nevada.
   The sale, at $20 a share, began two weeks ago.
   ``There's a lot of novelty interest in the stock. We don't know
how serious people are,'' Walloga said.``Of the people who call to
ask about it, about half call back.
   ``Some people think it's a speculative investment and they're
right. The people who should be buying it are the speculators.''

<HEAD>Former Peace Balladeer Cat Stevens Targeted by Disc Jockeys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cat Stevens once sang about peace, but disc
jockeys nationwide are having a less than peaceful reaction to his
support of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death threat against
``Satanic Verses'' author Salman Rushdie.
   Stevens was a leading pop balladeer of the 1970s, putting out
such hits as ``Moon Shadow,'' ``Peace Train,'' ``Wild World'' and
``Morning Has Broken.''
   But it's been years since his last hit, and the singer-songwriter
whose gentle style fit in so well during the last years of the
hippie generation has long since abandoned his music career to
follow the Moslem faith.
   The British-born Stevens, who now goes by the Moslim name Yusuf
Islam, leaped back into the spotlight last week when he created an
international controversy by telling Moslem students in England that
Khomeini's call to kill Rushdie was supported by the teachings of
Islam's holy book, the Koran.
   Radio stations around the United States responded almost
immediately by banning Stevens' records from their airwaves.
   ``The Koran makes it clear: If someone defames the prophet, then
he must die,'' the singer-turned-teacher said.
   Stevens, in a statement released Friday, denied he wants to see
the author killed, however, adding that he ``simply stated the
Islamic ruling on the Rushdie affair.''
   ``My only crime was, I suppose, in being honest,'' Stevens said
in the statement released in London. ``I stood up and expressed my
belief and I am in no way apologizing for it.''
   He also said the novel ``insults God and his prophets, including
those prophets honored by Christians and Jews as well as Moslems.''
   Meanwhile, officials at radio stations across the United States
said Friday they have pulled the singer's records from their play
lists.
   Stations such as WBZY-AM in New Castle, Pa., KZPS-FM in Dallas,
WCXR-FM in Washington, D.C., WEBE-FM in Westport, Conn., and KLSX-FM
in Los Angeles have dropped his records from their programming.
   In Detroit, album-rock purveyor WRIF-FM promoted a ``No Cat
Stevens Weekend'' by cutting into his songs with explosions or the
sound of a punch in the mouth ``right after a very optimistic and
non-violent line of dialogue,'' program director Marty Bender said.
   ``We're doing the `No Cat Stevens Weekend' to make a point about
one human being advocating the death of another.... This guy carries
a lot of weight, a lot of people grew up listening to his stuff,''
Bender said.
   A spokesman for WCXR in the nation's capital said that station
pulled the records off the air Feb. 28 after serious discussion of
listeners' complaints that they felt uncomfortable hearing Cat
Stevens.
   ``We didn't do this to generate publicity or to scream our call
letters out,'' said promotion director Mark Lapidus. ``We're trying
not to support an entertainer that's come out in favor of
assassination.''

   Midnight struck and Pat McGarry took a swig of beer,
thrust up a sign promising punishment for scab workers, and walked
across the street separating union headquarters from Eastern
Airlines property.
   The third strike against the airline in 31 years had begun.
   ``They wanted it and now they have it,'' said McGarry, 22, an
aircraft mechanic whose father, Russ, is coordinating national
strike activities for the 8,500-member Machinists union.
   The union went on strike at midnight Friday when talks in
Washington collapsed.
   McGarry was one of the first to reach the gates, locked and
topped with barbed wire. Before him stood police in riot gear.
Behind him, more than 2,500 red-shirted Machinists and supporters
quickly filled the narrow entrance way in front of Eastern hangars.
   For nearly 15 minutes, the chain-link fence took the brunt of the
frustration and anger union members say has been building since
Texas Air President Frank Lorenzo acquired the airline three years
ago. The fence bent under the push but did not give. The padlocked
gates rattled and police raised tear gas guns.
   ``We're just letting off steam,'' said Bob Santos, 41, an Eastern
baggage handler of 21 years. ``Hey, we just want to let them know
we're here.''
   A few paper cups were lobbed over the fence. Soon, they were
replaced by rocks and bottles. The crash of a cinder block startled
some officers. The chips were quickly gathered up and hurled toward
several Eastern management workers, who retreated inside.
   ``Get back. Get back across the street,'' cried a union official.
``We want to keep this legal. We're going to set up pickets, but
we're not going to break any laws.''
   A few union members lurched for the fence, but were pulled back
by union leaders.
   Then car horns blared. Workers heading back to union headquarters
blocked traffic for nearly 10 minutes as an effigy of a ``scab
worker'' was torn apart. The legs of the dummy were tossed above the
crowd. The head rested on the hood of a pickup truck.
   ``I hope Frank Lorenzo is watching,'' said Santos. ``The message
is pretty obvious.''
   After the display, police moved in and herded workers back onto
union property. Twenty-five minutes after midnight, the first of the
workers began to leave.
   ``I think we made our point,'' said Ray Fernandez, a 21-year
mechanic suspended without pay for a month following wildcat
walkouts in February. ``It was really just for show.''
   ``It was loud, but pretty peaceful,'' said Miami police
spokeswoman Myriam Royale.
   No arrests were made, no injuries were reported and no damage was
found, she said.
   Two hours into the strike, most of the workers had left the union
headquarters and pickets were under way at Eastern headquarters,
terminals and cargo facilities.
   ``We're going to keep this peaceful,'' said Wally Haber, senior
general chairman of the Machinists' Miami local. ``We just needed to
let off some steam.''

<HEAD>Businessman Linked To Socialists Charged In French Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A businessman linked to the governing Socialists has
been charged with insider trading, making him the sixth person
accused in a scandal that has embarrassed the government, a news
report said.
   Max Theret, a Paris investor who has backed Socialist Party
candidates, was charged Friday by Investigating Magistrate Edith
Boizette with insider trading, the news agency Agence-France Press
said.
   Quoting unidentified legal sources, the agency said Theret is
accused of illegally buying shares of a U.S. company, Triangle
Industries Inc., before the French state-owned aluminum manufacturer
Pichiney SA offered a higher price in a successful takeover. The
Pichiney offer sent the stock's price soaring.
   On Feb. 16, three men also were charged with insider trading:
Paris stockbrokers Pierre-Alain Marsan and Ricardo Zavala; and
Robert Reiplinger, Theret's partner in a Paris investment firm. Also
charged in the scandal that day was Roger-Patrice Pelat, a retired
businessman and longtime friend of President Francois Mitterrand.
   Theret was not charged with the others because he had been
hospitalized with a heart ailment. French law requires that an
investigating magistrate notify a suspect face-to-face of criminal
charges.
   Pelat and a friend, Isabelle Pierco, have been charged with
receiving insider information and profiting from it. The charge
carries the same maximum penalty as actual insider trading: two
years in prison and a fine of up to four times the amount of illegal
profits.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Calls Philippines President A `Figurehead'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A founder of a leading group of
communist rebels today called President Corazon Aquino ``a
figurehead'' and claimed the military actually runs her government.
   Jose Maria Sison, co-founder of the outlawed Communist Party of
the Philippines, made his remarks in a telephone interview from the
Netherlands, where he has sought political asylum. Manila radio
station DZRH reached him at offices of the Philippine rebel National
Democratic Front in Utrecht.
   The Front is the umbrella organization for 14 Filipino Marxist
groups, including the Communist Party of the Philippines and its
military arm, the New People's Army. The rebels have been fighting
the Manila government for 20 years.
   Sison said Mrs. Aquino has a different relationship with the
country's 160,000-member armed forces than did former President
Ferdinand Marcos, who she ousted in a civilian-backed military
rebellion in February 1986.
   ``Marcos controlled and manipulated the military as an
instrument,'' Sison said. ``Mrs. Aquino, on the other hand, is being
controlled and manipulated by the military. ... Aquino is a
figurehead president.''
   Sison said Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, a retired armed forces
chief of staff, holds sway in the military while Mrs. Aquino's
brother, Rep. Jose Cojuangco, controls ``money matters.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Col. Oscar Florendo, the armed forces spokesman who was
interviewed on the same radio program, said Sison is wrong.
   ``I think (Sison) is losing his mind,'' Florendo said. ``He has a
very rich imagination. Maybe that is the effect of the good life in
the Netherlands because he is not thinking of problems there.''
   Sison was on a speaking tour in Europe when his passport was
revoked in September by the government.
   Military officials accused Sison of engaging in subversive
activities against the government in his travels abroad. The
military has also charged that Sison had resumed his post as leader
of the clandestine Communist Party.
   Sison said nothing of his relationship to the rebel group during
his radio program. He also did not say whether Dutch authorities
have granted his application for asylum.
   Sison, who led a handful of university intellectuals in founding
the banned party in December 1968, was jailed for nearly 10 years
until Mrs. Aquino set him free.

   The state Board of Parole says Bernhard Goetz
must serve the full one-year prison sentence he got for illegally
carrying the gun he used to shoot four teen-agers on a New York City
subway in 1984.
   Releasing Goetz after just two months in jail ``would deprecate
the seriousness of the crime and undermine respect for the law,''
the board said Friday.
   Monday was the earliest Goetz could have been released.
   Edward Elwin, executive director of the parole board, said the
decision meant Goetz would have to serve his full one-year sentence,
minus any time off for good behavior, unless he can persuade a court
to overturn the board's ruling.
   Goetz, 41, was convicted on the gun charge, but acquitted of
attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment charges. The
case drew international attention.
   Some people called the white radio technician a racist vigilante
for shooting four black young men who were panhandling.
   Others hailed Goetz as a hero who resisted a robbery.
   Goetz maintained the men were about to rob him and that he was
acting in self defense.
   Goetz's attorney, Mark Baker, said he might try to have the
decision overturned and called the board's decision outrageous.
   ``Anybody in power is afraid to do something that favors Bernhard
Goetz for fear of being labeled a racist by the fringe elements,''
he said. ``So he sits and rots.
   ``He's angry. He's frustrated,'' Baker said of Goetz. ``He
doesn't belong there.''
   Goetz began serving his sentence Jan. 13 after appeals in the
state courts failed. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to
reverse the conviction.

<HEAD>Snow Blankets Much Of Midwest; Temperatures Sent Plummeting in Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow blanketed the Midwest today and a cold front sent
temperatures plummeting in Texas and much of the Plains.
   A blizzard warning was posted this morning in north-central
Nebraska, while winter storm warnings extended from northern New
Mexico across eastern and south-central Colorado, south-central and
eastern South Dakota, much of Minnesota, Wisconsin, upper Michigan
and northern lower Michigan.
   Friday evening snowfalls across Wisconsin included 10 to 12
inches in Brown and Waupaca counties and about 10 inches in Shawano
and Manitowoc counties.
   More than 8 inches fell at Alpena, Mich., and strong winds
created drifts of 2 to 3 feet.
   Snowfall in Minnesota included about 12 inches at Willmar, 10
inches at Minneapolis-St. Paul and New Ulm, 9 inches at Rochester, 8
inches at Pine City and 6 inches at St. Cloud.
   A cold front brought low temperatures across northwest Texas, as
the mercury fell 20 degrees in an hour at Abilene, and 26 degrees in
an hour at Amarillo and Childress.
   The high temperature at Lubbock was 83 degrees, then fell to 30
degrees during one hour.
   Cold air and strong winds brought late evening wind chills to 30
degrees below zero or colder in the northern and central Plains.
   Freezing rain extended from much of lower Michigan across
northern Indiana, southern Wisconsin, and northeast through
southwest Iowa.
   Snow fell in northern lower Michigan, Upper Michigan, northern
Wisconsin, Minnesota, northwest Iowa, eastern and south-central
North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, northern and western Kansas,
northern New Mexico, Colorado and southeast Wyoming.
   Thundershowers hit parts of Missouri, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to 70 mph near Jenks, Okla., and
nickel-size hail fell west of Edmond, Okla.
   Today's forecast called for snow spreading from the central and
southern Rockies across western parts of the southern Plains, the
central Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley to northern parts of
the upper Great Lakes; showers and thunderstorms in eastern Texas,
the lower Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee Valley and the Ohio
Valley; showers scattered from southern parts of the upper Great
Lakes across the lower Great Lakes to southern New England; freezing
rain in northeast New York state and parts of northern New England;
strong, gusty winds from Wyoming across the central Plains.
   Predicted highs: single digits and teens from the central and
northern Plains across the upper Mississippi Valley to upper
Michigan; 20s and 30s across the Rocky Mountain region, the Texas
Panhandle, much of Oklahoma, eastern Kansas and Iowa to the upper
Great Lakes, as well as northeast New York state and New England;
60s and 70s in central and Southern California and southern Arizona,
and from southwest Texas across eastern Texas, the lower Mississippi
Valley, the Tennessee Valley, much of the Gulf of Mexico coast and
the southern Ohio Valley to the southern Atlantic Coast; 80s in
Florida peninsula and south-central texas.
   The rest of the nation generally should have highs in the 40s and
50s.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 22 degrees
below zero at Butte, Mont., to 76 at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Feds Order Airlines To Check Boeing 747 Cargo Doors Within 30 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has issued an
emergency order requiring all U.S. airlines to reinforce latch
mechanisms on Boeing 747 cargo doors within 30 days.
   Friday's emergency airworthiness directive, which speeds up the
timetable of an earlier directive, also specifies inspections and
tests of the doors that must be done until modifications are
completed.
   The action Friday follows the Feb. 24 accident involving a United
Airlines jet that had taken off from Honolulu in which a 10-by
20-foot hole ripped in the fuselage and nine people were sucked from
the craft. They are presumed dead.
   Though the cause of the accident has yet to be determined, the
possible failure of the forward cargo door latch is under
investigation. The door was separated from the aircraft with parts
of the fuselage that surrounded it.
   The order affects about 150 airplanes. However, Tom Neale of the
Air Transport Association in Washington, D.C., said some airlines
have already made the required modifications, which include steel
reinforcements to cargo door latches.
   The FAA had issued a directive last July 1 ordering the doors
inspected and modified by the end of 1989 or July 1, 1990, depending
on the type of locking mechanism installed.
   That order was issued after a cargo door on a Pan Am 747 opened
1{ inches at the start of a flight from London to San Francisco. FAA
officials said they didn't believe at the time the situation
warranted an emergency directive.
   The FAA also said it planned to issue another airworthiness
directive in the near future requiring improvements in the warning
system that alerts flight crews when any cargo door is not properly
closed and locked. That order was expected as soon as the design
improvements can be delivered and tested.

<HEAD>Airports and Railroads Brace for Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILL LESTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines passengers today contended with
canceled weekend flights, bus companies geared up for extra business
and commuter railroads readied to become the next target of the
striking machinists' union.
   Eastern machinists, hoping to bolster their bargaining position,
said they would set up picket lines at commuter railroads in the New
York City area that serve 320,000 people daily.
   ``This thing will really take off on Monday, when we take out the
railroads. And we're prepared to do that,'' said Michael O'Connell,
president of Local 1894 at New York's Kennedy International Airport
after the machinists' strike against Eastern began early today.
   Eastern responded by cutting up to three-quarters of its weekend
flights, including most flights out of its Atlanta hub and nearly 60
other cities. The carrier's pilots and flight attendants said they
would honor the picket lines.
   The Miami-based airline, however, planned to maintain service to
nearly 50 cities, including most flights out of Miami and on
Eastern's Northeast shuttle and Latin American routes.
   Eastern also said other airlines were honoring its tickets.
   But the strike probably ruined a trip to Disney World for Phyllis
and Alan Zisser of Oceanside, N.Y., and their 3-year-old son. They
arrived at Kennedy airport as the strike began, and their Eastern
tickets to Orlando, Fla., weren't much good at the moment.
   ``Even 48 hours ago they told me don't worry, we're not going on
strike,'' said Mrs. Zisser. ``Now I can't get on half the flights
because they're all booked and don't have enough money to pay the
difference some other airlines want.''
   The machinists' union has contended that its union can picket any
transportation company covered by the Railway Labor Act, which
includes airlines, railroads and some shipping concerns.
   But other airlines insisted their machinists and other airline
workers would be violating no-strike clauses in their contracts if
they honored picket lines set up by Eastern strikers.
   On Friday, a federal judge in Washington agreed with the
airlines, and prohibited machinists' union members at other airlines
from joining the strike.
   But in Newark, N.J., Gene Hoffman, general chairman of District
100 of the Machinists, said union members at other airlines were
expected to walk out.
   ``There's a good possibility some of the other airlines will go
on sympathy (strike) with us, such as TWA, United, Northwest and
USAir,'' he said.
   In the New York City area, union leaders at the Long Island Rail
Road, Metro-North Commuter Railroad and New Jersey Transit say they
will honor Eastern picket lines on Monday.
   Robert Kiley, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, which oversees the Long Island Rail Road, and
Metro-North, predicted ``absolute chaos next week. And the fact is,
there's not a lot we can do.''
   Ramses Hernandez, a striking New York machinist, said he
understood that commuters would be upset if the strike expanded to
railroads.
   ``But we're fighting for all working people,'' he said. ``We
already have agreed to lower our salaries but that's not enough.
People just don't understand that this strike is not just for us. If
Eastern does this to us other companies will try to do it to them.''
   In Washington, the head of Amtrak said the national passenger
railroad could continue limited operations for only a few days if
picketed by workers supporting a strike against Eastern.
   Elizabeth Hale, a spokeswoman for Greyhound Lines, Inc. in New
York, said they would be using 200 additional buses to run extra
non-stop service between Boston, New York, Philadelphia and
Washington, beginning Monday.
   Travel agents said many Eastern passengers may be stranded
because a lot of other airlines and railroads were fully booked.
   Ida Cartazo, co-owner of the Mediterranean Agency in Lodi, N.J.,
said she had a group of 18 college students scheduled to fly to Fort
Myers Sunday for spring break. The students made their reservations,
including hotel, four months ago.
   ``The only thing I could do is tell them to drive down,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Bodies Stack Up In Morgues Over Compensation Dispute With Relatives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bodies are lying in morgues, sometimes for years,
while their survivors negotiate for money and jobs as compensation
from the dead relative's workplace, an official daily said today.
   For example, the China Daily said survivors of a worker at the
Beijing Theater Troupe have refused to let the body be cremated
until the troupe agrees to provide two apartments and a job for one
of the children.
   A second case was cited in the report of the body of a woman that
has been kept at one hospital for more than five years because the
family and her work unit can't agree on compensation.
   It also said in another hospital run by the military that 100 of
the 500 bodies in the morgue had been there more than two months.
   The daily quoted a Labor Ministry official as saying state-run
work units must pay pensions to children too young to support
themselves if their parents die or are seriously injured on the job.
   However, there are no regulations saying children can take their
parent's job, the report said.
   The official was quoted as saying, ``Chinese people are too
dependent on the government and their work units.'' He said the
Chinese ``should develop their abilities to support themselves in
society.''

   Ten people died today of burns suffered
when fire broke out at a parade in the steel city of Jamshedpur,
raising the death toll to 38, a news report said.
   The United News of India agency quoted hospital sources as saying
the death toll was expected to rise because 40 of the 200 people
injured had suffered burns over at least 75 percent of their bodies.
   The fire erupted Friday in a giant tent jammed with families and
executives watching celebrations at the Tata Iron and Steel Co.
complex in Jamshedpur, 140 miles west of Calcutta.
   The fire burned more than five hours before being brought under
control.
   The parade was part of the festivities marking the 150th
anniversary of the birth of Sir Jamshedji Tata, founder of an
industrial empire that encompasses steel and textile mills, bus and
truck manufacturing and a variety of other enterprises including
telephones, watches and cosmetics.

   An oil tanker that ran aground floated free when
salvage workers lightened the ship's load to prevent more crude oil
or fuel from spilling into the Pacific Ocean and washing up on
Hawaii's beaches.
   The 800-foot Exxon Houston ``suddenly just started floating,''
Coast Guard spokesman David Goff said Friday night.
   Officials had planned to wait until high tide early today but
workers who pumped off more than 9,400 tons of ballast water and
some of the remaining 3.8 million gallons of crude oil lightened the
ship enough so that it floated free on its own, said Scott
Hartvigsen, another Coast Guard spokesman.
   He said the ship was being towed to deeper water and two ships
would stay with it overnight ``but everything's going great so far.''
   Officials today were to assess the damage to the ship, as well as
the extent of the oil spill, already in the thousands of gallons, he
said.
   Meanwhile, state and federal agencies launched a cleanup of the
thick, smelly oil washing in along a 2-mile stretch of little-used
shoreline 15 miles west of Honolulu and famed Waikiki Beach.
   High winds and rough seas tore the vessel from its offshore
mooring Thursday night. It ran aground on a coral reef and ruptured
a fuel tank.
   A local oil spill cleanup cooperative, called the Clean Islands
Council, was on the scene, said Les Rogers, spokesman for Exxon Co.
USA, the Houston-based domestic oil and gas division of Exxon Corp.
The Coast Guard's Pacific Area Strike Team was en route to help in
the cleanup.
   Exxon Co. USA, will pay for the costs of the cleanup, according
to Exxon attorney Leonard Alcantara.
   The Exxon Houston had unloaded 400,000 barrels of Alaska crude
oil at an offshore mooring a mile off the Hawaiian Independent
Refinery when it tore free, said Capt. Gordon Piche, commanding
officer of the Coast Guard's Marine Safey Office.
   The skipper, Captain Kevin Dick, notified the Coast Guard there
was no need for assistance, but 2{ hours later, the ship radioed it
had run aground in 27 feet of water about one-third mile offshore of
Barbers Point, located on the southwest corner of Oahu, Hawaii's
main island, Piche said.
   When the ship tore away from its mooring, floating hoses
unloading the oil pulled free, spilling about 25,000 gallons of
crude oil into the sea.
   Although valves automatically closed, the oil spilling from the
hoses created a three-mile-long oil slick spreading parallel to the
shore to the east toward Honolulu. By Friday night, it was
dissipating and posed no immediate threat to the shoreline,
officials said.
   When the ship ran aground, one of the vessel's fuel tanks
ruptured, spilling about 92,000 gallons of the thick black oil, much
of it washing ashore, fouling the sand and coral rocks.
   Libert K. Landgraf, deputy director of the Department of Land and
Natural Resources, said there was no immediate evidence of injury or
death to marine life or birds.
   Oil washed up on a beach where a popular tourist luau is held,
prompting the state Department of Health to post ``Polluted Waters''
signs, and at other areas as far as two miles to the north, said
Coast Guard spokesman Dennis Hubbard.
   Meanwhile in the Florida Keys, an oil slick about 2 miles long
and a quarter-mile wide was reported Friday about 10 to 12 miles off
the north Key Largo coast, said to Coast Guard spokesman Joe Dye.
   The origin of the oil had not been determined, but Coast Guard
marine safety office spokeswoman Lynn Mountcastle said it could have
been bunker oil released by a ship.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha says he is
determined to serve out the rest of his current term despite
``derision and attacks'' following his stroke.
   The 73-year-old Botha, in an interview published today by major
Afrikaans-language newspapers, said it was too early to speculate
whether he would seek another term after his five-year term expires
in September. He plans to return to work in April.
   Botha suffered a stroke on Jan. 18 and has spent most of the time
since then recuperating at his coastal vacation home while his
duties are carried out by an acting president, Constitutional
Development Minister Chris Heunis.
   Botha said in the interview he would complete the term despite
calls for him to step aside.
   ``The fact that I am still subject to derision and attacks shows
that I am in the way of some people,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I
have a task to perform and as my strength increases I will proceed
with that task.''
   Calls from his resignation have come from liberal and far-right
opposition parties, as well as from some members of his National
Party. A former Cabinet minister, Hendrik Schoeman, said at a
National Party rally Wednesday that Botha should make way for F.W.
Klerk, who took over as party leader a month ago and is heir
apparent for the presidency.
   Schoeman ``has said out loud what all other Nationalists are
thinking: President Botha must go _ now,'' Business Day, a leading
financial newspaper, said Friday in an editorial.
   Although de Klerk shares Botha's views on most major policy
issues, he has been depicted as more flexible. During Botha's
convalescence, both de Klerk and Heunis have suggested in speeches
that the government is willing to lessen its reliance on racial
classification as the foundation for political and social structures.
   However, de Klerk has told white voters he will not betray them
and has affirmed his commitment to segregated residential areas for
whites who want them. Like Botha, de Klerk has given no indication
he is willing to consider full voting rights for the country's black
majority.

<HEAD>INS Official Attacks Audit Claiming Citizenship Papers Are Missing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Immigration and Naturalization Service official
described as irresponsible an audit that claimed thousands of
citizenship certificates _ worth as much as $155 million on the
black market _ were lost from the Miami office.
   ``These are dangerous allegations that now show those who
investigate need investigation,'' said Perry Rivkin, INS district
director in Miami.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the government's
audit was conducted at the request of Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh. Runkel would not comment on specific findings of the
report, adding that it won't be made public until INS has had an
opportunity to review and comment on it.
   The audit claimed 23,000 citizenship certificates, which are as
good as a passport, had been misplaced.
   About 14,000 of the supposedly missing documents belonged to new
citizens sworn in by then-Chief Justice Warren Burger in a widely
publicized July 1986 ceremony at the Orange Bowl, said Rivkind.
   ``This is the most irresponsible statement I have ever heard in
all my years of service,'' Rivkind said Friday. ``The fact is, they
never were missing _ all they had to do was to look into the
computer.''
   All but 1,200 of the certificates were discovered in one computer
bank, and the rest were expected to be located after a check of a
second, Rivkind said.
   Rivkind said he wrote Washington two weeks ago about problems in
the report and asked that the auditors be investigated.
   ``There were false statements made,'' he said. ``When I first saw
that document, it took 60 seconds to ascertain through computer
records that those (certificates) were not missing.''
   Earlier Friday, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner
Alan Nelson was asked about the certificates at a Senate Judiciary
immigration subcommitte hearing in Washington.
   Nelson told the panel's chairman, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., he first learned of the supposedly missing certificates
from the Justice audit. The commissioner said he didn't know about
the finding until he read the audit.
   In Friday editions, the Washington Post reported that Justice
auditors found serious instances of mismanagement, including the
episode involving the missing certificates.
   The audit said INS couldn't account for them more than a year
after investigators discovered them missing, and the agency took no
steps to prevent further losses.
   The report also said that two years after investigators found at
least 61,500 naturalized citizens hadn't turned in their permanent
resident alien cards, the agency had not tried to recover them.

   Physicians treating a snake-venom
researcher, whose need for rare medicine prompted White House
intervention, were awaiting a shipment of serum from Iran today to
counteract a deadly viper bite.
   In an unusual effort initiated by Stephen Studdert, special
assistant to President Bush, antivenins effective against the bite
of a Pakistani pit viper were located in Iran, England and the
Soviet Union, and U.S. Customs rules were waived to place the
shipments quickly on flights to the United States.
   The antivenins were sought for William E. Haast, 78, who was in
serious but stable condition at the University of Utah Health
Sciences Center today after being bitten in the left hand by the
viper earlier in the week.
   The British shipment from the English National Poison Unit in
London arrived Friday night. But doctors did not administer it to
Haast, deciding instead to wait for the more effective Iranian
serum, said nursing supervisor Rick Taylor.
   ``The one from Tehran is the best one, I understand, because of
its properties,'' Taylor said. ``We will not give the London one
unless Mr. Haast's condition deteriorates.''
   Haast was being given plasma intermittently to replace
coagulating elements of his blood. The snake's venom prohibits blood
from coagulating and victims often bleed to death.
   Haast, director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at the
university's Research Park, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity
to withstand the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital
Wednesday.
   The Pakistani pit viper, or saw-scaled viper, is one of 1,000
exotic, poisonous snakes Haast keeps at the lab, where their venom
is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for
use in research and the manufacture of antivenins.
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from California's
San Diego Zoo, including one shipment obtained through an unusual
airport relay involving zoo personnel, a helicopter and a departing
jetliner.
   Studdert of Salt Lake City said he became involved Thursday night
when he received a call from an associate of Haast's. The associate,
who had read accounts of a speech Studdert gave in Utah describing
Bush's ``kinder, gentler'' approach to human problems, said the
serum could only be located in the Soviet Union and Iran and asked
for the Bush administration's help.
   Studdert said he immediately set up conference calls with people
around the United States and in other countries after doctors and
specialists advised the White House that the serums Haast needed
were unavailable in the United States.
   Using an American interpreter who speaks Farsi, Studdert put
Haast's representatives in telephone contact with serum specialists
in Iran.
   Two different serums were needed, he said, one for young pit
vipers and another for older snakes of the same breed.
   Vials of the Iranian serum were due to arrive in Utah this
afternoon.
   The serum found at the London institute was the antivenin used
for younger vipers.
   Another supply of the serum was obtained through the Tashkent
Institute of Vaccines in the Soviet Union. That serum was being
flown to Frankfurt for eventual shipment to the United States.
   ``When I decided I should get involved, I clearly did not want to
disturb the president,'' Studdert said. ``But I decided, this is
what the president would have wanted us to do.''

<HEAD>Town Raises Money, Police Officers Recalled</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MCKEESPORT, Pa. _ Twenty-one officers laid off from this
Pittsburgh suburb's 50-member police force will resume work Sunday
thanks to a successful fund-raising campaign to pay their salaries.
   ``The response has been overwhelming,'' said Mayor Lou Washowich,
who announced the recall. ``McKeesport residents and people outside
the city have continued to support the police. ... When asked,
they've always responded.''
   Donations reached $106,000 on Friday, including a bank's pledge
to match donations dollar for dollar, Walt Patterson, chief of the
emergency medical services.
   Shoppers were still dropping coins and bills into cans at local
businesses, and a number of fund-raising events were scheduled for
this weekend, including dances, a basketball game and a health fair.
   ``We've received checks from all over the country, Nevada,
Florida, Ohio, New York, Connecticut, virtually everywhere,''
Patterson said. ``These are people who lived here 30, 40 years ago
and people who never knew how to spell McKeesport.''
   Police Chief Thomas Brletic expressed relief as he drafted work
schedules. He had to make do without the officers since they were
let go last Sunday.
   ``This past week, while it's been very busy, the good Lord must
have been watching us because we didn't have anything terrible
happen,'' he said.
   The mayor had asked all employees to accept a wage freeze after
the city discovered a $1.3 million deficit late last year. He had
said layoffs would result if the request were refused.
   Washowich announced the layoffs Feb. 1, saying they were
necessary because state arbitrators awarded the police pay raises of
4 percent to 4.5 percent. He said the city would save $90,000 by
laying off 21 officers for three months.
   The city's volunteer ambulance company, McKeesport Emergency
Medical Services, launched the fund-raising drive with a $15,000
donation Feb. 24.
   Washowich said the success of the fund-raiser won't solve the
city's long-term money woes, however.
   ``I'm sorry to say the reality will set in,'' he said. ``Next
year we have to find $200,000 to $220,000.''

<HEAD>Independent Group Pulls Own Candidates to Boost Reform Communists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent Lithuanian group has withdrawn two
candidates for a new Soviet congress in an effort to improve the
chances of Communist Party reformers running for election, a group
spokesman said today.
   The move by the independent organization, known as Sajudis,
leaves Lithuanian Party leader Algirdas Brazauskas and his top
deputy, Vladimir Beriozov, unopposed in the March 26 elections, said
group spokesman Alvydas Medalinskas in a telephone interview from
Vilnius.
   He said Sajudis wanted to bolster the reformers' chances against
what he called ``Stalinist'' officials in a split developing in the
republic's Communist Party.
   The spokesman said Sajudis candidates Algimontas Nasvitis and
Alvydas Yozaitis withdrew from the race, part of the Soviet Union's
first national multi-candidate elections, ``for the good of
Lithuania.''
   Brazauskas has been popular in the western Baltic Republic since
he appeared at meetings of Sajudis and returned the cathedral in
Vilnius to the Roman Catholic Church.
   Medalinskas said Brazauskas faces a challenge from Jonus
Guryatskas, secretary of the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, who led a
strong attack on Sajudis in a recent meeting of the policy-making
party committee.
   He said Sajudis candidates Algimontas Nasvitis and Alvydas
Yozaitis withdrew from the race, part of the Soviet Union's first
national multi-candidate elections, ``for the good of Lithuania.''
   The independent group will continue to run its own candidates
against Communist Party officials in almost all of Lithuania's 44
electoral districts, Medalinskas said.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Sajudis and other
independent groups have blossomed in the three Soviet Baltic
republics, which include Estonia and Latvia. The groups are pushing
for greater autonomy from Moscow.

   A ferry carrying 200 people capsized in
the Kancha River today, and a news report said 20 people died and
about 100 were missing.
   Police recovered 20 bodies and were trying to determine how many
of the missing drowned and how many swam to the banks of the
fast-moving river located 85 miles south of Dhaka in southern
Bangladesh, United News of Bangladesh said.
   The ferry, which was licensed to carry only 85 people, capsized
because it was carrying too many passengers and loaded with more
than 25,000 pounds of rice in sacks piled on the ferry's deck, the
news agency said.
   Parliament said earlier this month that at least 900 people have
died in the last seven years when ferries they were traveling in
capsized.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will cut oil exports by about 5
percent in the first half of this year, Tass said. The move is part
of an effort by non-OPEC producers to shore up world oil prices by
cutting or freezing exports.
   The action was announced Friday by Vladimir Arutyunyan, chairman
of the Soyuzneftexport All-Union Foreign Trade Association, which
markets Soviet petroleum products abroad, the official Soviet news
agency said.
   The announcement indicated a change in Soviet thinking about oil
exports. In November, the deputy oil minister, Vladimir Filanovsky,
said the country planned to continue increasing exports in the face
of falling world prices because it needed the foreign currency.
   Tass quoted Arutyunyan as saying the oil exports will be reduced
by about 5 percent in the first six months of 1989 compared with the
same period last year. The Soviets export an estimated 1.8 million
barrels of oil a day. A 5 percent reduction would mean a cut of
90,000 barrels daily in export sales.
   In trading Friday, energy futures prices declined in volatile
trading, with crude oil soaring toward the $19-a-barrel level before
technical selling set in. Analysts in New York said the brief rise
came after the Soviet Union, Mexico and Egypt _ producers outside
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries _ all announced
the 5 percent reduction in exports.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 16 cents lower
at $18.56 a barrel, after rising as high as $18.88 at one point
during Friday's session.
   Earlier this week, oil producers outside OPEC met in London to
coordinate output with the 13-member oil cartel. At the end of the
meeting, a majority of the countries pledged to freeze or reduce
their exports during the second quarter of 1989 in an attempt to
shore up world oil prices.
   The Soviet Union reportedly told the other countries it was
unsure whether it would reduce exports, but that if it did, it would
notify them Friday. The Tass dispatch quoting Arutyunyan was
distributed late Friday in Moscow.
   According to the CIA's 1988 ``International Energy Statistical
Review,'' of the amount of oil the Soviets exported daily in 1987,
7,000 barrels went to the United States, 243,000 to Finland, 209,000
to France, 302,000 to Italy, 142,000 to the Netherlands, 199,000 to
West Germany, 130,000 to India and 20,000 to Japan.

<HEAD>Official Says Prince Charles Hasn't Learned From Skiing Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Swiss Ski Federation official
has accused Prince Charles of being reckless by skiing off marked
trails where a year ago an avalanche killed a close friend of the
heir to the British throne.
   The official made the accusation after a newspaper printed a
photograph purportedly showing Charles skiing in a restricted area
on Mount Gotschna near warning signs printed in four languages,
including English.
   ``There are those who learn from a mistake and there are others
who don't. Wednesday's front-page picture shows clearly that neither
the prince nor his entourage heed the warnings of the responsible
local officials,'' Sepp Scheibert said in a letter published today
in the newspaper Blick.
   Scheibert, chief of the federation's mass sports section,
stressed in his letter to the mass circulation paper that the
prince's group also was off trails when an avalanche killed a former
queen's aide, Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, and broke both legs of another
member of the party, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson.
   In addition, Scheibert wrote, the Davos Institute for Avalanche
Research said snow conditions on the day the photograph was taken
were ``identical with those prevailing a year ago when the killer
avalanche struck.''
   ``What can the local officials do when such an `illustrious'
party ignores all rules and recommendations?'' he asked.
   Such conduct ``turns to ridicule all advisory bodies,'' he said.
   Charles, 40, arrived at Klosters on Monday for a skiing vacation
at the resort where the tragedy occurred March 10, 1988.
   He narrowly escaped injury on that day when the avalanche roared
down on a group of skiers he was leading on a steep run off marked
trails.
   Swiss authorities ruled the six-member group caused the avalanche
but that nobody could be held personally responsible.
   Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson's husband, Charles, who was with the skiing
party in 1988, also accompanied the prince this year.
   The group has been reported skiing mostly on a face of the
8,000-foot Mount Gotschna, several miles south of the site of the
earlier avalanche.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says Novel Offended Islam, Iran Notes Her `Sympathy'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with British official supporting
Rushdie, Iranian response. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government today reaffirmed its support
for author Salman Rushdie and warned that continued agitation over
his novel ``The Satanic Verses'' could do serious harm.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said he understood ``the hurt and
insult being felt'' by Moslems over the book but said most Britons
accept ``that in a free country people have the right of freedom of
expression.''
   Rushdie, 41, who was born a Moslem in India, has been in hiding
since Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered his death on Feb.
14 and Iranian clergy offered a bounty of up to $5.2 million for the
killing.
   Hurd spoke to reporters at a local government conference of the
governing Conservative Party. It came one day after Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said she believes the novel has deeply offended
Islam.
   Earlier today, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said
that Mrs. Thatcher's comment was ``the first expression of sympathy
with Moslems over the book.'' Later today, Tehran Radio released a
lengthy commentary saying Mrs. Thatcher's acknowledgement must be
followed up ``with concrete actions.''
   If Britain accepts that the book is insulting, the state-run
radio said, it ``cannot object to the death sentence on the writer,
which has been issued in line with Sharia (Islamic law).''
   The radio called on Mrs. Thatcher's government to clarify
``whether or not freedom of expression and writing can be a license
for defamation and insult.'' ``If the British government does not
see the freedom of expression as a license for defamation, then
legal prosecution of the author, prevention of further publication
of the book, and removing already published copies are reasonable
requests which can remove much of the friction (in the present
situation),'' Tehran Radio said in a report monitored in Cyprus.
   Iran's Parliament said on Tuesday it would cut diplomatic ties
with Britain in a week unless it disavows the contents of Rushdie's
novel, which has been held as blasphemous by Moslem protesters
around the world.
   Britain insists Khomeini withdraw the death sentence on Rushdie,
who is now a naturalized Briton. Rushdie telephoned a parliamentary
aide on Friday to express concern that Britain was backing down in
its support for him.
   Asked whether the government was changing its attitude to
Rushdie, Hurd said: ``There's no vacillation. Let's for heaven sake
let the thing settle. Let's not keep the agitation going. It could
do serious harm.''
   IRNA also said Mrs. Thatcher's statement was ``a clear attempt to
defuse the row between Britain and Iran before next Tuesday's
deadline that the Iranian Parliament gave to London to alter its
attitude or face the consequences of a complete cut in diplomatic
ties.''
   The dispute has led the 12-member European Economic Community and
several other countries to withdraw their ambassadors from Iran.
   In Halifax in northern England, about 80 teen-agers broke away
Friday from an anti-Rushdie demonstration by 1,600 people and
damaged several cars, police said. A policeman fell and bruised his
leg, they said.
   Moslems who organized the protest immediately apologized and
offered to pay for any damage, police said.
   One death was reported Friday in clashes between police and
anti-Rushdie protests in the northern Indian city of Srinagar.
Police reportedly fired on Moslem demonstrators, killing at least
one person and injuring more than 100.
   Eighteen other people have been killed in protests over the book
in India and Pakistan.
   Demonstrations by Moslems occurred today in Bangladesh where
about 400 people marched through Dhaka shouting ``Death To Salman
Rushdie!'' and in Thailand, where about 700 protesters in Bangkok
burned an effigy of Rushdie.

   Israeli troops blocked West
Bank roads today and turned back hundreds of Israeli peace activists
seeking to meet Palestinians in the Arab city of Ramallah.
   Activists of the mainstream Peace Now movement were outraged and
said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin is ``surrendering'' to demands
of Jewish settlers. A Defense Ministry official said the army was
concerned clashes would break out between Jewish settlers and Jewish
peace activists.
   Legislator Dedi Zucker of the left-wing Citizens' Rights Movement
Party said the blockades reflect a government policy not conducive
to making peace, Israel radio said.
   A convoy of dozens of cars and a bus, bearing poster-size signs
saying ``Peace Now,'' was one of five groups that left four Israeli
cities to meet West Bank residents in different locations to talk
peace today. The army blocked them all, Israel radio said.
   As the Jerusalem convoy made its way north from the city,
military jeeps drove into the middle of the road.
   ``I'm sorry, but I must inform you this is a closed military
area,'' a soldier identified as Col. Chai said. ``You cannot
proceed.''
   ``We weren't planning any assemblies or marches or demonstrations
_ just meetings,'' said Peace Now spokesman Tsali Reshef.
   ``We would like to prove to Israel and to the rest of the world
that with the right approach and with mutual respect, peaceful
relations can be had ... and we will not give up,'' he said.
   Uri Ariel, head of the West Bank Settlers' Council, was one of
several settlement leaders who on Friday called on the army to block
the meetings, charging they would ``legitimize terror'' by
encouraging the Palestinian anti-Israeli revolt. At least 388
Palestinians and 17 Israelis have died in the uprising in the
occupied lands, now in its 15th month.
   The proposed talks had been coordinated with underground leaders
of the Palestinian revolt, and the Palestinians had agreed to stop
violence and protests in meeting areas, Peace Now activists said.
   The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising distributed a
leaflet in Ramallah, saying: ``We call on the masses of Palestinians
... not to attack cars with Peace Now signs.''
   Peace Now has called on Israel to negotiate with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which the government refuses to do because
it regards the PLO as a terrorist movement.
   As troops watched the Israeli vehicles make U-turns on the
outskirts of Ramallah, about 10 Palestinians cheered from the
roadside, clapping and shouting, ``Peace, peace.''
   The activists returned to a Jerusalem parking lot where they
unfurled banners demanding, ``Stop Shooting! Speak Peace Now!''
   Legislator Ran Cohen addressed the crowd briefly.
   ``Defense Minister Rabin is ready to let 365 days go by in which
there are dead and wounded on both sides, but he won't let even one
day go by in which the two sides talk to each other,'' Cohen said.
   ``If anyone is killed or wounded today, it is his fault.''

<TEXT>
   Laos put on hold today a scheduled joint
excavation with the United States to search for remains of missing
American soldiers, a U.S. diplomat in Bangkok said.
   Fourteen U.S. experts were to fly to Laos aboard two C-130
transport planes this morning, but Vientiane did not give the planes
clearance to enter Laotian airspace, said U.S. Embassy spokesman
Ross Petzing.
   He refused to speculate on the Laotians' possible reasons.
   Laos officials may have been angered when President Bush on
Wednesday recommended to Congress that the country and its neighbor,
Burma, be declared ineligible for U.S. aid because of alleged
support for drug trafficking.
   The recommendations came in an annual report Secretary of State
James Baker III sent to Congress. It said U.S. officials believe
opium production is expanding in Laos and could be approaching 300
tons a year, and that heroin is being refined there for export
through Thailand, Vietnam and China.
   U.S. officials say there is evidence that Laotian officials are
involved in processing and smuggling drugs. When that charge
surfaced in last year's narcotics report to Congress, the Laotian
government issued a stern denial.
   The United States is trying to account for 547 Americans listed
as missing in action in Laos during the U.S.-Vietnam war. Most were
airmen who flew reconnaissance and bombing missions.
   Laos had conducted four joint excavations with the United States.
The first one was in February 1985.
   The Pentagon said the latest excavation was to be in southern
Savannakhet province, where a U.S.-Laotian team surveyed in
December. The United States has no record of a U.S. plane crashing
in the area. Petzing said the U.S. team had planned to work in Laos
for eight to 10 days.

   A limping man used his cane to beat a
convenience store clerk and stole cash from the register after he
was told the liquor he wanted was available only in pints, police
said.
   The man limped off with $70 to $80, said police spokesman Ned
Ewing.
   The man, described as in his 30s, asked to buy a fifth of liquor
Friday and ``got agitated'' when told the store stocked what he
wanted only in the smaller size, Ewing said.
   The man beat the clerk on the head with his cane, then hit her
with a beer bottle, Ewing said. The clerk, who had been alone in the
store, ran into the bathroom screaming for help, he said.
   The man then rifled the cash register. A customer who entered the
store when the thief walked out found the clerk and called police.

<HEAD>Turkish Husband of Greek Cypriot to be Deported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young Turkish settler who crossed
illegally into southern Cyprus to find his Greek Cypriot wife will
be deported, police said Saturday.
   The 17-year-old husband, Cengis Ciskun Seytan, was arrested last
week after slipping through the fortified no-man's-land separating
Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus from the Greek Cypriot southern
sector.
   ``It's been decided that he should be deported to Turkey and not
prosecuted here,'' Larnaca police chief Anastasis Prastitis said.
   Last summer, Seytan married 15-year-old Alexia Chronia, whose
family belongs to a dwindling community of about 1,000 Greek
Cypriots living in the Karpas district of northern Cyprus.
   The wedding received much publicity.
   Greek Cypriot authorities claimed Miss Chronia had been abducted,
forcibly converted to Islam and forced to marry Seytan.
   But U.N. officials who investigated said the teen-ager, who had
attended high school in the Greek Cypriot sector, denied she was
kidnapped and claimed she was in love with Seytan.
   Last month, however, she returned to the south declaring she had
been forced to marry Seytan and that he had threatened to harm her
parents if she refused.
   After hearing that Seytan had come south to find her, the bride
again changed her story.
   ``I love Cengis, but my family forced me to say I was kidnapped
to cover up the shame of my conversion to Islam,'' she said.
   Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded the north of the island following an Athens-inspired coup
aimed at union with Greece.
   Seytan is one of about 50,000 Turkish settlers brought to
northern Cyprus to boost the area's Turkish Cypriot minority.

   Authorities in Baoan County have shut down all 16
of the area's massage parlors because of links to prostitution, an
official daily said Saturday.
   Baoan is the latest of several places in Guangdong province and
other areas of prosperous southern China to move against massage
parlors offering illicit sex to newly rich Chinese and visitors from
nearby Hong Kong.
   The overseas edition of the People's Daily said the county began
closing the parlors and removing their shop signs Jan. 21. The women
working in the shops, many of them recruited from rural areas

   Ten people were killed and 35 others were injured
when an explosion destroyed a passenger bus in the central city of
Zhengzhou, an official daily said Saturday.
   The Legal News said the explosion occurred on the bus shortly
after it left a Zhengzhou station Thursday.
   The explosion blew off one-third of the roof of the bus and
demolished the vehicle, it said. The disaster stopped traffic for
six hours.
   The report did not say what caused the explosion, but it said
police reported finding large quantities of sulfurous acid in the
remains of the bus. The report did not say how many passengers were
on the bus.

<HEAD>Shadowy Youth Gang Comes To Symbolize NYC Street Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City high school students are taking lessons in
fear these days, and their teachers are the Decepticons _ a loosely
organized gang of young thugs who have assumed near-mythical status.
   While the gang, which preys largely on fellow teen-agers, is
responsible for only a small part of youth crime in the city,
educators say its impact goes far beyond its reality.
   ``The idea of the Decepticons has a lot of power over the kids.
It's a symbol of something bad. Like, `the boogey man is coming, the
Decepticons are coming,''' said Patricia Black, formerly a Bronx
principal and now the superintendent of Manhattan high schools.
   The drug rings that have gradually replaced most of the city's
old neighborhood-based youth gangs are more violent and make a lot
more money. But the ``Decepts,'' who emerged about three years ago
and named themselves after a group of cartoon characters, have
gained a unique hold on the imagination of high school students as a
horde of rowdies preying on easy victims near schools, taking
anything from earrings to expensive sneakers.
   Black said the mere rumor that the Decepticons were going to
invade her South Bronx high school a couple of years ago brought the
police out and prompted many parents to keep their children at home.
The Decepts failed to show up; in fact, they've never been known to
actually invade a school building.
   A group of students leaving the Park West High School on
Manhattan's West Side several days ago all knew of the Decepticons'
reputation and said many teen-agers feared them.
   ``They steal bus passes, sneakers, gold jewelry, anything,'' said
one boy who declined to give his name. But he and the other youths
said they had never actually encountered the Decepticons and knew no
one who had.
   There are 56 known members of the Decepticons, including 14 girls
who call themselves Deceptinets, police said. Gang members, who come
from all over the city and range in age from 15 to 22, typically
hang out near a school during lunch breaks or after classes and
occasionally mug a vulnerable youngster.
   They generally gather first at a Brooklyn high school and then
commute to Manhattan where they can seek victims around several high
schools along the East Side or West Side subway lines, said Edward
Muir, head of the United Federation of Teachers safety committee.
   The Decepticons have attained their notoriety largely because
``they're the only game in town,'' Muir said. Drug rings, with their
tremendous profits, lure most of the youths who would have been
drawn to the old-style gangs and their turf battles, authorities say.
   ``You can certainly make a lot more money by selling drugs to
kids than by stealing their sneakers,'' Muir said.
   During the early 1970s, the city had some 400 youth gangs with
nearly 20,000 members. The police now know of 37 gangs with about
1,000 members, said Sgt. John Galea, head of the police department's
youth gang intelligence unit.
   The Decepticons, named for fiendish, missile-hurling cartoon
characters on television's ``The Transformers,'' are the largest and
by far the most notorious of the remaining youth gangs.
   The Decepts wear no insignia or gang colors and dress like many
other teens in designer clothes, expensive leather basketball shoes
and lots of gold jewelry. They dress like other city youngsters,
Galea explained, ``because they steal the other kids' clothes.''
   They arm themselves with ax handles, hammers, box cutters,
occasionally knives, but they rarely carry guns, Galea said. Almost
exclusively, their victims are their peers.
   Five Decepticons were arrested on assault charges last year, and
gang members were charged in 43 robberies, mostly involving thefts
of clothing and jewelry, police said.
   The reality of the gang is that it exists. The mythology is that
it is everywhere in large numbers, Galea said: ``We have reports
that they're going to invade schools in Manhattan, the Bronx,
Queens, all in the same day.''
   Galea says the Decepticons are responsible for only a ``very,
very small portion of youth crime.''
   But the gang has a strong hold on the imaginations of many
students who use the term ``Decepts'' for any group of violent teens.
   ``Their name is by far the most infamous; it does elicit fear,''
Galea said. ``As the kids travel throughout the city, this is the
name they hear.''

   Woo, woo, woo! It's almost time for da
Shemp Festival. Dat's Shemp, as in Larry, Moe an' Coiley, but widout
dem udda guys.
   The Fifth Annual Shemp Festival, March 18 and 19 this year,
celebrates the birthday of what organizers call the most forgotten
of the Three Stooges.
   Highlights include a pie fight with 1,000 specially baked pies.
   And then there's the crowning at the 1989 Pie Queen at the Shemp
Festival Banquet.
   ``The festival committee will be looking for the most upper
crust, snooty socialite hag who degenerates into the most low-down,
disgusting hedonistic slime,'' said Kirk Landry, one of three
friends who dreamed up the festival. ``You also get bonus points for
trying to bribe Senior Festival Committee members with sexual
favors.''
   Shemp, actually Sam Horwitz, was born March 17, 1895. He and Ted
Healy organized the trio of Shemp, his brother Moe and Larry Fine.
Shemp left the group in 1934, was replaced by his brother Curley,
rejoined in 1946 and died in 1955.
   ``They were great comics,'' Landry said. ``Everybody can identify
with them.''

   Say you get an envelope in the mail and you
want to see if it's a bill or a notice that you've won a $1 million
sweepstakes before ripping it open. Or you're curious about the
plain brown wrapper addressed to your teen-aged son.
   Sharper Image, the retailer of high-tech toys for grown-ups, is
selling a $39, 3{-ounce spray that turns a thick manila envelope
transparent, allowing the user to read what's inside.
   The X-Ray Spray, on the market for two weeks, begins to evaporate
within 30 seconds and leaves no indication the envelope has been
altered. The manufacturer says the liquid is nontoxic, nonflammable
and won't smear ink.
   No sales figures were available, but ``we've sold quite a few
though _ mostly to people who want to use it as a joke,'' said Anne
McCamman, a sales clerk at Sharper Image's store on Market Street.
   Joke or not, not everyone's amused.
   ``I don't want to call anyone slimy, but why would you need this
spray for anything but reading someone else's mail?'' asked Postal
Service inspector C.W. Lawrence in Washington.

   There's a new face among the cows in
the feedlot at Robert Gravelle's farm.
   A 500-pound elk joined the herd last November and Gravelle's
family named her Elsie and kept quiet about her until hunting season
was over.
   Elsie's not a secret anymore, but no one in this Lake Champlain
town near the Canadian border can figure out where she came from.
   ``Once we saw her coming out of the water, coming out of the
lake,'' Gravelle said. ``That kind of makes me think she came from
Vermont. She might have crossed the lake.''
   Lake Champlain separates New York from Vermont.
   Wildlife officials say Elsie probably escaped from captivity, but
so far no one has reported her missing. A tag in the animal's ear
carries a number, but no information about her home.
   Whatever her origin, Elsie should be safe among Gravelle's cows.
   ``If anyone even looks at her the wrong way, they could be in big
trouble,'' said Lt. Charles Reynolds of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation. ``There is no open season on elk in New
York state, so elk cannot be hunted.''

<TEXT>
   Oliver North's lawyers have been complaining
since the former White House aide was indicted that national
security concerns were imposing unfair restrictions on the defense.
   Last week, they found an outlet for their frustration.
   North's courier to the Contras, Robert Owen, wrote memos
outlining the military needs of the guerrilla force and the names of
some Central American officials assisting them.
   The government censored portions of some of the memos for use at
North's trial, but last Monday night, North's lawyers found out that
uncensored versions of the memos had become public eight months ago
in a civil case.
   Adding fuel to the fire was the fact that two lawyers and the
security chief in the office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh
had been told Feb. 10 about the dissemination of the uncensored
memos.
   On Tuesday, North's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the
indictment based on prosecutorial misconduct and renewed old motions
that the Classified Information Procedures Act should be declared
unconstitutional as applied to North's case.
   On Friday, instead of the trial, U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell held a hearing on North's motions on constitutionality. He
plans to rule this week.
   At the hearing, Gesell both criticized North's lawyers for
demanding too much disclosure and sought to reassure them.
   There can be cross-examination without disclosing ``every name,
every security technique, every secret code that's in the case,''
said Gesell.
   At another point, he said:
   ``I don't want to kill anybody ... but beyond that ... you have
an open door'' to disclose a substantial amount of sensitive
material, a comment that should give U.S. intelligence agencies
pause.
   The tension between national security concerns and North's right
to a fair trial promises to plague the former White House aide's
case to the end. The trial _ in which opening statements were Feb.
21 _ could last up to five months.
   Tuesday afternoon found one of the prosecutors in the case,
Michael Bromwich, sitting in the witness box trying to explain what
happened after Owen's lawyer mentioned to him Feb. 10 that he had
given uncesored copies of the memos last June to the Christic
Institute, an activist group opposed to U.S. policy toward Central
America.
   Bromwich said he informed the security officer in his office and
then never gave the matter another thought. The other prosecutor
present in the meeting also moved on to other matters, said John
Keker, chief of the prosecution team in the North case. The security
officer, Allen Stansbury, said he decided to wait until after the
Justice Department security chief returned from vacation before
taking any action to retrieve the memos. No one else was told,
including North's lawyers.
   North attorney Brendan Sullivan had been cross-examining Owen on
Monday and had objected to the prohibition of the use of a high
Costa Rican official's name in one of the Owen memos. Owen met with
the official while on an inspection trip for a possible site for an
airstrip.
   The prosecution found out late Monday night that the news media
was getting uncensored versions of the memos. Prosecutors quickly
obtained approval from intelligence agencies to authorize
unrestricted use at trial of the ones deemed relevant to North's
defense.
   However, the damage was done.
   ``An evidentiary hearing should be held to determine when the IC
was first aware of the production of documents to the Christic
Institute, what efforts if any the IC made to prevent disclosure to
the Institute, why the fact of public disclosure was withheld from
the defense and the court while these matters were being hotly
litigated in the course of Mr. Owen's cross-examination, and all
other relevant information,'' said Sullivan.
   Problems have arisen repeatedly in the case in connection with
classified material and the law that governs its use.
   The prosecution was forced to seek dismissal of the conspiracy
and theft counts in the indictment because attempting to prove them
in court would have required disclosure of more classified material
than intelligence agencies were willing to allow.
   The prosecution has been helped somewhat by the pre-trial
disclosure provisions of federal law concerning use of classified
material at trial. North's lawyers have been required to notify the
government of all the classified documents they plan to use in
court. Also required was a 162-page summary of classified testimony
the defense plans to present.
   When the defense declined to explain what counts of the
indictment to which it planned to tie the material, Gesell declared
he was unable to rule on its admissibility and said he would rule as
the trial proceeds.
   That approach triggered such serious concern in the intelligence
community that on Feb. 9, the Justice Department began trying to
delay the trial, while prosecutors declared their intention to
proceed. The impasse was resolved when Walsh's office agreed to
establish a notification mechanism under which the Justice
Department would be told anytime particularly sensitive information
was about to be presented by the defense in court. The procedure
would provide the government an opportunity to object.

   Authorities said Saturday they arrested three members
of a right-wing terror group in connection with a plot to stage a
prison break at a maximum-security prison.
   Police said the three were arrested Thursday afternoon when they
claimed a suitcase at a suburban train station that contained a
submachine gun, a pistol, ammunition, police uniforms and fake
Italian army license plates.
   Italian news agencies said police identified the trio as Antonio
D'Inzillo, Gianluca Ponzio and Giorgio de Angelis, all 26 and all
from Rome. Police said they are members of the Armed Revolutionary
Nucleus terror group.
   Three other people were arrested Feb. 18 in connection with the
planned break from Rebibbia prison.
   Police said one of the three arrested in February, Luca Onesti,
33, tried to swallow a piece of paper that contained details of the
plot.
   Authorities said the note outlined a plan to conceal explosives
inside cakes and smuggle them into certain inmates at the prison,
which is on the outskirts of Rome.
   The plot was reportedly aimed at freeing some prisoners with
rightist sympathies and some imprisoned for violent crimes. It did
not say how many inmates were supposed to be freed.

<TEXT>
   The blood bath triggered by Venezuela's
attempt to revive its economy underscores the gravity of Latin
America's $420 billion foreign debt.
   Venezuela, the world's eighth-largest oil producer, has long been
regarded as an oasis of prosperity and stability in a region swamped
by poverty and political upheaval.
   But last week, rioting left at least 300 people dead.
Venezuelans, accustomed to three decades of democratic rule,
witnessed the specter of soldiers and tanks patrolling the capital
under martial law.
   The disturbances broke out Monday when bus fares rose 30 percent
by government decree. At the same time, prices on a range of basic
goods and services such as gasoline, bread and electricity rose
sharply under the government's economic-adjustment program, which
also provided for a rise in interest rates and a currency
devaluation.
   To offset price increases, the government doubled the mininum
wage to the equivalent of $110 a month. But for many Venezuelans,
the wage increases were cut in half by higher transport fares alone.
   President Carlos Andres Perez announced the measures Feb. 16, two
weeks after taking office, to satisfy requirements of the
International Monetary Fund and Western creditor banks. The main
requirement was that Venezuela lift government subsidies that had
kept prices artificially low for years.
   Had the government not imposed the price increases, Perez said
Friday, it would have had no chance of obtaining $4.8 billion in
loans from the IMF.
   He linked the civil unrest directly to Venezuela's $33 billion
foreign debt, saying interest payments were consuming 70 percent of
oil revenues and undermining the nation's ability to provide for its
18 million people.
   Moreover, the president said debt-burdened nations throughout
Latin America were vulnerable to similar uprisings spawned by
economic hardship.
   ``I hope this painful sacrifice by our country will cause the
leaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are not
exaggerating when we say the crisis is serious,'' Perez said.
   According to a study last year by the Caracas-based Latin
American Economic System, a regional think tank, the region spent
$139 billion from 1982 to 1987 in servicing foreign debt. Not only
did that not dent the obligation, debt actually grew over the
period, mostly because of more loans just to pay interest.
   If the trend continues, the organization said, the standard of
living of Latin Americans will not return to levels of the 1970s
until the year 2000.
   Venezuela is the region's fourth-largest debtor behind Brazil, at
$114 billion; Mexico, at $106 billion; and Argentina, at $54 billion.
   Venezuela, however, is one of the few developing countries that
has been trying to repay debt, dipping into reserves built up before
the collapse in world oil prices in 1986. The others simply
reschedule their debt.
   Peru, with a foreign debt estimated by the World Bank at $19
billion, has paid almost nothing on its debt since President Alan
Garcia in 1985 imposed a ceiling on debt payments of 10 percent of
the nation's export income. Its foreign reserves have since run out,
and the country has entered into a steep recession.
   Venezuela's government is seeking to defer further interest
payments on its foreign debt until September. Perez said any
decision on delaying payment beyond that will depend on the success
of his new economic program.
   The major debtor nations have been urging creditor nations for
years to come up with a comprehensive plan for solving the debt
crisis, but no formula has emerged.
   A U.S. banker based in Caracas said the Latin debt crisis could
be traced mainly to ill-conceived government economic policies.
   He said Brazil had dealt with its huge debt by printing more
money, creating an annual inflation rate of 3,000 percent.
   In Venezuela, the banker said, successive governments have tried
to win popular support by maintaining low prices through subsidies.
   ``The fact is they have pursued policies that would have brought
them to the edge of economic ruin regardless of debt,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   For example, gasoline, which rose in price 80 percent, had been
selling for 6 cents a gallon.
   The crunch started in the early 1980s, as an oil glut forced
prices down and the standard of living of most Venezuelans fell. Oil
revenues account for 90 percent of Venezuela's foreign exchange
earnings.
   For many Venezuelans, the government's austerity measures
confirmed that the days of prosperity were over. Years of pent-up
frustration were vented in the bloodiest rioting the country has
seen.
   Perez said Venezuelans could expect at least six more months of
economic hardship before the economy begins to expand.

   Up to the midnight hour, federal mediators were
holding out a glimmer of hope that Eastern Airlines might settle
with its Machinists union, but in the end a 17-month deadlock
remained unstuck.
   The two sides were about as far apart as labor and management can
get: $200 million.
   The airline, facing $1 million-a-day losses, wanted its biggest
union to take a 15 percent to 26 percent pay cut totaling $150
million. The union wanted 8 percent salary increases for its 9,100
members at a cost of $50 million, but offered in the final hours to
start with a 15-month freeze, chief negotiator Charles Bryan said
Saturday.
   Each side characterized the other's position as outrageous.
   Accusations flew back and forth: The company was out to bust the
union. Organized labor wanted a strike to test President Bush.
Parent company Texas Air head Frank Lorenzo wanted to chop up and
sell off the 60-year-old airline. The union wanted a better deal
than other employees who already had taken cuts. Management wanted a
better deal than other airlines who operated at a profit without
cutting salaries.
   Overshadowing the charges and countercharges was already shaken
public confidence in air travel because of recent accidents and
terrorism, controversy over corporate takeovers such as the one that
absorbed Eastern into the nation's largest airline company, and
questions about Bush's relationship with organized labor in the
first months of his administration.
   These and other issues affecting aviation loomed over the final
negotiations leading up to 12:01 a.m. Saturday when Bryan, the
president of the Eastern local, declared: ``It's shut down.''
   Pressure on both sides to reach a settlement came mostly from the
National Mediation Board, which handles labor disputes in the
transportation industry. Federal negotiator Harry Bickford had spent
more than a year trying to get the two sides together.
   Other pressures early on pointed to a strike. Organized labor
declared strong support for the union, including pledges to honor
picket lines no matter where they are set up. Eastern advertised the
editorial support it was getting in its efforts to prevent Bush from
stepping in to stop a strike.
   On Thursday, mediation board Chairman Walter C. Wallace had
expressed strong optimism over the first new Eastern proposal in
months, enthusiastically telling a news conference it offered a
possible ``breakthrough'' in the talks.
   It became clear on Friday, however, that there wasn't going to be
a breakthrough.
   About three hours before the midnight Friday end of a federally
imposed 30-day cooling-off period, Wallace said the union had
rejected the new offer, which only slightly toned down the proposed
salary cuts.
   But that was not the end of the negotiation in what was supposed
to be a secret Washington location.
   Reporters, photographers and television crews gathered in the
final hours on the sidewalk in front of the downtown Radisson Park
Terrace Hotel to buttonhole negotiators as they entered and left.
Hotel officials ushered journalists out of the hotel lobby, but
periodically sent out hotel personnel to serve free coffee.
   Eastern's team already had set up shop at a different location,
which did remain secret. Much of the final bargaining was over the
phone, said Wallace.
   But a half dozen times during the evening, Eastern negotiators
arrived and then left, refusing to talk with reporters.
   Members of the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents
Eastern's 3,500 pilots, also walked in and out of the meetings, but
said little about the talks after issuing a statement threatening
what they said would be safe and legal steps that would
``substantially delay'' flights nationwide.
   Union negotiators remained silent to the outside world.
   Later, Eastern chief negotiator Tom Matthews told reporters the
company made several offers in the last hours, but accused the union
of never waivering from its original demand. He said the company had
modified its proposals to soften pay cuts.
   Its major new offer would have reduced hourly top-scale wages
from $18.83 to $16 for aircraft mechanics and from $15.60 to $11.54
for baggage handlers, with no hope of increases for five years.
   The cuts were a few cents kinder than the offer Eastern stuck
with during months of talk, but they were still too harsh for the
Machinists. Bryan said Eastern's bargaining demands were virtually
the same as they had been since the beginning. The union, on the
other hand, offered a 12-month wage freeze, then a 15-month freeze,
in its final efforts to avert a strike.
   Union demands included sweeping measures such as guarantees from
Eastern that it would rebuild itself to its former size. Lorenzo has
sold off some of its assets and is awaiting Federal Aviation
Administration approval to sell Eastern's lucrative Northeast air
shuttle services to New York developer Donald Trump.
   Company officials have accused the union of trying to run the
business.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, in declaring national support
for the Machinists before the strike, accused Lorenzo of trying to
destroy Eastern.
   ``What the facts will show,'' said Kirkland, ``is that Mr.
Lorenzo has found it worth his while to purchase a good comapny and
strip its assets, rather than operate it fairly and decently.''
   Bush foreclosed the surest way to averting a strike when he
announced nine hours before the deadline that he would not call an
emergency panel that would have delayed a walkout by at least 60
days. His decision came despite recommendations from the National
Mediation Board, 33 Senators and labor unions that he step in.
   In what was viewed by many in organized labor as the first major
test of his dealings with the union movement, Bush did exactly what
management had asked: nothing.
   It was clear that when Bush made his decision, he knew settlement
was unlikely. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, shortly after
meeting with Bush, said all the information he had pointed to a
strike.
   ``It is time for this dispute to come to an end. It makes no
sense whatsoever to let these skirmishes and drawn out negotiations
continue for another 60 days,'' Skinner said.
   One of Eastern's offers in the final 90 minutes said the union
could walk off the job for 48 hours and get full pay for employees
while they vote on whether to ratify the strike.
   That, too, was rejected.
   After it was all over, Eastern's Mathews declared, ``We will
continue to bargain. ... Strikes are not the end; they are the
beginning of another period of time.''

<HEAD>Samuel Beckett Emerges from Silence with Meditation on Age</HEAD>

   In his 83rd year, Samuel Beckett has emerged from a
studied silence with a brief novella, a meditation on old age that a
reviewer praised as ``another of Beckett's nihilistic mantras, best
mumbled aloud.''
   Only 200 copies of ``Stirrings Still,'' the 1,801-word new work
by the Nobel Prize-winning author of ``Waiting for Godot,'' are
being printed. They are offered for sale at $1,720 each.
   ``The way they've gone this morning, they'll be gone by next
week,'' publisher John Calder said Friday, after the entire novella
was published in The Guardian newspaper.
   The signed, limited edition includes illustrations by the Irish
artist Louis LeBrocquy, who also illustrated an edition of James
Joyce's ``Dubliners,'' Calder said. A mass-market edition will be
published, he said, but not for a couple of years.
   Calder said ``Stirrings Still'' was written in response to pleas
from Beckett's American publisher, Barney Rossett, formerly of Grove
Press Inc., though there are no immediate plans to print it in the
United States.
   It is a tale, reviewer Frank Kermode wrote in The Guardian, that
is typical Beckett _ ``of a featureless man in a virtually
featureless world, expressing a condition in which everything that
characterizes some of our normal assumptions about human existence
... is virtually annulled, in prose rich only its unmatched
parsimony.''
   Given the price, Kermode said, ``purchasers can henceforth
meditate the destitution of their existence and simultaneously take
pleasure in their privilege.''
   This paragraph is typical of the style of the opus:
   ``A clock afar struck the hours and half-hours. The same as when
among others Darly once died and left him. Strokes now clear as if
carried by a wind now faint on the still air. Cries afar now faint
now clear. Head on hands half hoping when the hour struck that the
half-hour would not and half fearing that it would not. Similarly
when the half-hour struck. Similarly when the cries a moment ceased.
Or merely wondering. Or merely waiting. Waiting to hear.''
   Born in Dublin and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge,
Beckett went to Paris in 1928 and became acquainted with James
Joyce, the Irish novelist and poet who became the subject of
Beckett's first published essay a year later.
   Beckett eventually decided to live in France, saying he preferred
``France in war to Ireland in peace.'' He has continued to live in
France, writing both in French and English.
   His last work, Calder said, was a novella titled ``Worstword Ho''
in 1982.
   ``Stirrings Still'' is hardly Beckett's most concise work.
``Breath,'' a 1969 theater piece, consisted of a pile of rubbish, a
breath and a cry, lasting no more than 30 seconds.

<HEAD>Three Dead In Chain Collision Caused By Blowing Dust, Unknown Motorist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOWIE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A motorist who stopped on a highway during a
blinding dust storm is believed to have started a chain reaction
collision of 31 vehicles in which three people were killed, police
said.
   At least 40 people were injured.
   The motorist who stopped in a traffic lane on Interstate 10 in
southeastern Arizona was not involved in the accident, and drove
away before anyone recorded his license number, the state Department
of Public Safety said.
   Officer Dick Pittman said eight tractor-trailer rigs, a Greyhound
bus and 22 cars were involved in the accident in the middle of the
afternoon Friday.
   ``It was total black. You couldn't see the road,'' said Lee Host,
of Chicago, the driver of a tractor-trailer rig that struck the
Greyhound bus. He suffered only a bruised arm.
   Wreckage was still being cleared away Saturday.
   The entire front of the bus, en route from Phoenix to El Paso,
Texas, was sheared off when it collided with another vehicle after
being struck from the rear by Host's truck.
   ``You don't have no protection up there (in the driver's seat),''
said bus driver J.D. Black, 43. ``It's just fiberglass and thin
metal. I'm very glad to be alive.''
   Black, of Phoenix, said most of his 25 passengers were treated
for minor injuries. A bus official said a pregnant woman was
admitted to a hospital for observation.
   Rik Wilson, 36, was on his way from California to New Mexico in
his new pickup. He said he saw a jackknifed tractor-trailer on the
road in front of him, and started pulling off toward a ditch on the
left.
   ``Then I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw a bus skidding
toward me,'' he said. ``I opened the door to get away. I was just
out the door when the bus hit my truck.''
   ``If I had been in the vehicle, my head would have gone right
through the windshield,'' Wilson said.
   At least two of the dead were believed to be out-of-state
truckers, Pittman said. The injured were taken to hospitals in
Willcox, Benson and Tucson.

<HEAD>Will Tower Episode Spawn New Ethical Climate in Senate?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Returning to his Capitol Hill office one night
last week, Sen. Arlen Specter jokingly told a reporter: ``This is
the last time I'm riding in an elevator with a woman who's not my
wife.''
   Black humor remarks like those of the Pennsylvania Republican,
spawned by the controversy over John Tower's alleged drinking and
womanizing, were common in the corridors of power and underscored
the ticklish nature of the debate over President Bush's nominee for
defense secretary.
   So sensitive were senators that one telephoned a reporter at
night simply to make sure it was clear his comments about a
colleague's fondness for ``bimbos and booze'' were made in jest.
   ``Times have changed in the Senate,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, a Tower defender who vowed to put the spotlight on any
senator thought to be engaging in improper behavior in the future.
   Tower, a 24-year Senate veteran who is facing an uphill battle in
his drive for confirmation, tried to turn the tables on his former
colleagues by demanding that Congress ``articulate what its own
standards are'' on drinking as well as accepting honoraria, campaign
contributions and vacations from special interest groups.
   Tower's challenge did not fall on deaf ears.
   Some senators said the historic debate might lead to reforms in
campaign financing and even produce a stricter ethical climate in
the nation's capital where social habits have already changed over
the last decade.
   Tower raised the money issue as a counterpoint to critics who
said he was too cozy with the defense industry because his
consulting firm accepted about $1 million in consulting fees from
defense contractors over the past two years.
   ``I accept that the secretary of defense must adhere to a higher
standard than members of the Senate,'' Tower said. ``But my question
is, how much lower an acceptable standard is there for members of
the Senate?''
   Senators drew a distinction between money and drinking issues
and, in general, they defended their colleagues' behavior.
   ``I've been here 16 years and I've never seen one (senator) drunk
on the Senate floor,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., responding
indirectly to Tower's implication that such activities took place.
   Others disputed Biden's claim.
   ``I've seen senators come to the Senate floor intoxicated,'' said
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a teetotaler. Helms refused to identify
those he'd seen drunk.
   ``There have been abuses, no question about it,'' said Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill.
   And Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., said some senators continue to
have ``grape and grain on their breath'' when they come to work.
   But on Capitol Hill, as in society as a whole, heavy drinking is
not as common as it was in the past, observers say. The
health-conscious ``yuppie generation is different,'' said manager
Nick Selimos at the Monocle Restaurant, a favorite watering hole for
lawmakers, lobbyists and aides.
   Selimos, who was interviewed by FBI agents about Tower's habits,
said that when senators come to the bar ``half the time they drink
soft drinks.''
   Jane Ikard, a Washington hostess, said the new capital mores stem
in part from the advent of the ``power breakfast'' where politicians
have to be fresh early in the morning.
   ``You can hardly get people to eat now ... to say nothing about
smoking and drinking,'' Mrs. Ikard said.
   That wasn't always the case, according to Robert Parker, the
retired maitre d' of the Senate dining room. In a 1986 book entitled
``Capital Hill in Black and White,'' Parker wrote of widespread
drinking and womanizing.
   First elected to the House in 1974, Simon said he'd noticed a
``gradual improvement'' in the ethical climate in Congress ``with
the notable exception of campaign financing.'' He supports public
financing of senatorial campaigns.
   ``I think it might'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., when asked
whether the Tower debate might lead to reforms in rules governing
how campaigns are financed and what types of outside income they are
allowed to earn in office.
   The furor over the Tower nomination might spur Congress to press
forward on campaign reform, said Biden, chairman of the Senate
judiciary committee.
   Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby, said the 100
senators kept a total of $2.3 million in honoraria in 1987. In the
two-year election cycle, 1987-1988, the 33 Senate winners in the
1988 election collected about $31 million from political action
committees.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., chairman of the Senate ethics
committee, said it was too early to tell what longstanding changes
might occur as a result of the Tower debate.
   ``I just have to evaluate it when it simmers down,'' he said.
   But Specter said he hopes the biggest change will be a new
reluctance on the part of politicians to say, ``I'm not going to
answer personal and irrelevant questions.''

<HEAD>No Grassroots Groundswell for Tower Laid to White House Ineptitude</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With senators feeling little pressure from back
home to support John Tower, backers of the embattled nominee for
secretary of defense are blaming the White House for failing to
generate grassroots political heat on behalf of the former Texas
senator.
   ``They never put a campaign together,'' said Lyn Nofziger, who
orchestrated grassroots campaigns as Ronald Reagan's White House
political director.
   ``It has never been reduced to an ideological issue out in the
country,'' said Republican consultant Roger Stone. ``So Democrats
from conservative states, say Howell Heflin of Alabama, for example,
they feel no pressure from rank and file voters to vote for Tower.
   ``It has never been posed in an ideological framework. We're
voting over whether this guy is a drunk and womanizer or not.''
   One indicator of the lack of pressure is the volume of mail
reaching the Capitol.
   An aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy said the Massachusetts Democrat
had received a total of 260 letters on the Tower appointment, most
of them opposed to confirmation. By contrast, during the fight over
the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court, Kennedy received
more than 55,000 letters and telegrams.
   A similar report came from the office of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the
Texas Democrat still listed as undecided. An aide said that during
the past week, Bentsen had received 1,978 letters, telegrams and
phone calls opposed to Tower and 1,649 supporting him.
   ``The political pressures on this are pretty much a wash,'' said
Jack DeVore, Bentsen's press secretary.
   Scott Maxwell, a spokesman for Sen. Sam Nunn, the Georgia
Democrat leading the fight against Tower, said, ``The volume of mail
is not anything like it was with Bork and Nunn has a much higher
profile on this one.''
   ``Bork was an ideological fight,'' said David Keene, chairman of
the American Conservative Union and one of a group of conservative
leaders urged by President Bush at a White House meeting on
Wednesday to try to generate support for Tower.
   ``There was no cover (on Bork),'' said Keene. ``There was no
subterfuge. Bork was being deprived of confirmation to the Supreme
Court because of what he believed.''
   In the Tower debate, continued Keene, senators are saying that's
not the case. ``It's these personal problems,'' he said. ``That may
be only partially true, but at least it gives them the cover.''
   ``The Bork thing was much more intense out in the hinterlands,''
said Steve Roberts, Republican National Committeeman from Iowa.
   ``There hasn't been a great groundswell out here (on Tower) or
really any great contact from the Republican National Committee,''
said Roberts.
   Perry Hooper, a party official from Alabama, said, ``I'm all for
John Tower. ... But at the same time, it's not that traumatic. I'm
all behind the president getting his way, but if we lost it, you
just go to somebody else.''
   Eddie Mahe, a Republican political consultant, said he just
returned from a trip to several states. ``You know what never comes
up? John Tower. Maybe, three people brought it up. ... With the
American people, it as an issue that has no impact on them one way
or the other.''
   The past week, the president stepped up his efforts to generate
support for Tower.
   ``At this late date,'' said Nofziger ``when you've drawn the
political lines, it's awfully hard to get any significant Democratic
votes.''
   The former Reagan aide speculated that the White House ``never
took the thought that John Tower might be in trouble seriously.''
   In addition, Nofziger and others noted that conservative
activists are split on the Tower nomination.
   Paul Weyrich, chairman of the Free Congress Foundation, was the
first witness before the Senate Armed Services Committee to allege
that Tower had a drinking problem.
   ``There was a series of things that suggested to conservatives
that this was not a fight to get into because nobody in the
administration really cared that much about it,'' said Keene.
   Was that an accurate impression?
   ``No, I think it was reflection of the fact that they (the White
House) may not have it together yet,'' he replied.

   A crowded ferry capsized Saturday in
southern Bangladesh, and at least 23 people drowned and many others
were missing, news reports said.
   Three bodies were recovered from the hull of the ferry after
rescue teams hauled the boat out of the swift flowing currents of
the Kancha river, United News of Bangladesh said.
   The other 20 bodies were found during a search of the accident
site, UNB said.
   The accident occurred near Hularhat, a town 85 miles south of
Dhaka.
   The ferry was designed to carry 85 people but actually carried
200 people and 26,400 pounds of rice, authorities told the news
agency. The weight caused the ferry to lose balance and overturn in
the river.
   The news agency said some people were missing, but it did not
give a specific figure.
   It said rescue operations were hampered by swift currents.

   Prosecutors have issued warrants for the
arrests of 47 acupuncturists on charges they bribed a state
licensing official for answers to an exam they must pass to practice
in California.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner said Friday that the 30 men and 17
women were charged with paying bribes, ranging from $5,000 to
$27,000, to a member of the California Acupuncture Examining
Committee.
   Dr. Chae Woo Lew, 54, of Hillsborough, resigned his post on the
committee's 11-member board after he was arrested in January on
charges that he took nearly $500,000 in bribes from 54 aspiring
acupuncturists between 1982 and 1988.
   A native Korean, Lew wrote and judged all the exams administered
in Korean, according to Herbert Lapin, a deputy district attorney
prosecuting the case.
   Lew was charged with conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to
dissuade a witness and 54 counts of bribery. He could face a maximum
of eight years in state prison if convicted.
   Lew, who is free on $5,000 bail, is scheduled for arraignment
Tuesday.
   Complaints against the 47 acupuncturists, which were filed
Thursday, allege one felony count of bribery against each defendant.
   The acupuncturists could face sentences of two to five years if
convicted.

<HEAD>Alar Controversy Rocks Apple Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The great American apple, baked in a pie and
teamed with motherhood as the symbol of all that is wholesome, is
once again under attack for health risks.
   Alar, a chemical used to make apples crisper and more colorful,
was labeled a possible carcinogen last week by the Natural Resources
Defense Council, adding more fuel to nationwide concerns.
   That is an ironic twist for an industry that spends millions of
dollars each year promoting the healthful aspects of apple
consumption.
   Most growers have voluntarily halted the use of Alar, fearing bad
publicity more than bad production. But many are bitter over a furor
they say is unnecessary and unfair.
   ``There is absolutely no imminent health risk in eating apples or
apple juice or apple sauce or any other apple product,'' said
Charles St. John, a spokesman for the Washington Apple Commission,
which has a grower-financed $14 million annual budget to promote
apples around the world.
   Alar is the trade name for daminozide, a chemical growth
regulator marketed by Uniroyal Chemical Co. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency announced last month that it intends to ban Alar
by 1990, but for now it is still legal to use. The cancer risk from
Alar was not so bad as to warrant an immediate ban, the EPA said.
   Apples are a huge business in Washington, where 5,000 growers
produced more than $300 million worth of apples last year.
Washington grows half the nation's supermarket apples, with
thousands of workers employed in packing and shipping the fruit, and
making juice, applesauce and other products.
   The industry feels threatened by last week's NRDC report warning
that eating Alar-treated apples increased cancer risk, especially in
children.
   The report found that children who consume large amounts of fruit
and fruit juice face a cancer risk of about one case for every 4,200
preschoolers exposed to Alar.
   The report has been attacked by some scientists and the acting
EPA head as misleading and promoting hysterical fears. It is also a
frustrating public relations problem for Washington growers, and the
industry is launching a counterattack.
   ``It's not illegal and not in any way harmful to anybody's
health,'' said Marv Sundquist, who co-owns 600 acres near Yakima.
``There are so many other things we consume every day that have so
much greater risk than this would have.''
   The Washington Apple Commission contends only about 5 percent of
the acreage is sprayed with Alar. The state Department of
Agriculture puts the figure at about 7 percent.
   The NRDC estimates are somewhat higher, but no one really knows
for sure how much Alar is sprayed because its use is not regulated.
Uniroyal has said Alar sales are down 75 percent since Alar fears
were first raised in 1985.
   Alar is not a pesticide, and it can't be washed off the apples by
the consumer. It is sprayed on trees in the spring and acts to keep
apples on the tree longer. That makes harvesting easier, improves
the apples' color and firmness, and extends their shelf life.
   The most recent reports about Alar are already hurting apple
sales, which were showing a decline by the end of the week.
   ``Shipments are slow,'' said Jay Grandy, president of the Snokist
apple cooperative in Yakima, on Friday, adding that Alar fear ``is
the only thing I can point to.''
   The Alar dispute hits growers in the pocketbook in more ways than
one. U.S. consumers want crunchy, colorful apples, and they simply
cannot be produced in national volume without chemicals, St. John
said.
   ``When you ask the consumer, `Will you buy something that is not
as appealing or crunchy (but not treated with chemicals)?' they'll
tell you, `Yes, I would,''' he said. ``But we know from actual
practice in supermarkets that they don't.
   ``Americans have been so preconditioned that everything we
purchase must be the biggest and best,'' he said. ``Our lower grades
of apples aren't as appealing ... and we are not able to sell them.''
   Nevertheless, many major grocery store chains, like Safeway,
contend they accept no Alar-treated apples.
   Major juice makers like Tree Top Inc., based in the Yakima suburb
of Selah, say the same. But a recent Consumer Reports study found
Alar residues in 23 of 32 apple-juice samples it tested. The
magazine did not identify which brands it tested.
   The chemical first came under a negative spotlight in 1985, and
by 1986 the Washington Apple Commission was recommending that
growers not use it.
   The industry has hoped that the completion of extensive tests on
Alar would clear it for use. But the EPA announcement last month
that it planned to ban Alar, on the basis of preliminary testing,
was viewed as a major setback.
   It is only the latest apple industry chemical to come under fire.
   Earlier this century, growers sprayed orchards with lead arsenate
in an effort to kill codling moth. That drew the ire of the Food and
Drug Administration and overseas customers. Nicotine was later
tried, but was expensive and made applicators sick. When DDT came
into use in 1947 it was considered a miracle, but was ultimately
banned by the EPA.

   The prospect of seeing a UFO lured more than
4,000 people to the town of Fyffe, greatly outnumbering the town's
residents.
   ``This is unreal,'' Police Chief Junior Garmany said Friday night
while he watched bumper-to-bumper traffic in the town of 1,300
people in northeastern Alabama. ``We've never had traffic like
this.''
   Municipal Court Clerk Tammy Mitchell said Saturday the previous
night's crowd had been estimated at ``4,500 or something like
that.'' She said people were ``riding around, buying T-shirts, going
to a bonfire.''
   But for all the hoopla, no unidentified flying objects were
sighted Friday. Visibility was obscured by clouds and light rain.
   ``I hope it rains tonight,'' Ms. Mitchell said Saturday.
   Friday night's visitors drove up and down the town's main street
while others stood gaping at the sky. Fire Chief Ricky Dobbins
invited some to his house on the outskirts of the town where he
built a bonfire.
   Police radio dispatcher Shelia Smith said she has been answering
calls from people wanting directions to Fyffe.
   Fyffe got on the UFO circuit Feb. 10 when a woman reported seeing
a strange light in the sky and police later reported seeing a large
lighted object passing silently over them. Numerous other sightings
have been reported since then.

   A new version of the ``United Methodist
Hymnal'' is on the way to selling 3 million copies after
compromising on hymns deemed to be racist, sexist or militaristic.
   About 20,000 of 37,000 United Methodist churches have placed more
than 2.77 million orders for the book, which will be released this
summer.
   The large sale reflects the United Methodist Publishing House's
decision ``always to keep the church aware of the product that was
coming out,'' hymnal editor Carlton Young said last week.
   The 25-member hymnal revision committee evoked controversy when
it decided to drop the song ``Onward Christian Soldiers'' because of
militaristic references. But the panel voted three months later to
retain it in response to complaints.
   The 960-page hymnal uses ``God'' in many references instead of
``he.'' Masculine references to people also were avoided.

<HEAD>Administration Decides to Allow Transfer of Jetfighter Technology
to Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has decided to proceed
with a controversial deal under which a major U.S. defense
contractor would work with Japan in developing and producing an
advanced version of the F-16 fighter, congressional sources said
Saturday.
   They said that following an interagency review, the
administration was expected to send formal notification of the
technology transfer agreement to Congress on March 13.
   There is opposition on Capitol Hill to the plans to transfer to
Japan $7 billion in advanced American aircraft technology that would
enable Japan to build a proposed FSX fighter to upgrad its air
capabilities by the late 1990s.
   Under the pending agreement, St. Louis-based General Dynamics
would join forces with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to
co-develop and co-produce the next-generation fighter.
   A congressional source, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, said, ``There are going to be some changes in the
agreement to control and monitor what type of technology flows.''
   The source said that chances appear to be slim that Congress
would be able to block the deal by passing resolutions of
disapproval.
   ``It's really long odds to stop it,'' he said. ``It's possible,
but it would be tough, very tough.''
   A group of 21 senators introduced last month a
sense-of-the-Senate resolution declaring they have ``strong
reservations'' about the FSX deal.
   In the House, 24 congressmen have sent a letter to President Bush
saying that they intend to fight the agreement when it goes to
Capitol Hill.
   The New York Times reported Saturday that Commerce Secretary
Robert A. Mosbacher, who had led opposition to the FSX within the
administration, has now been mollified by the compromise worked out
in the review process.
   Proponents of the FSX deal say it is the best that could be
negotiated _ in view of Japanese refusal to buy wholly
American-built planes _ and that it fosters beneficial technology
transfer in both directions with Japan while generating income and
jobs for U.S. industry.
   Critics, however, contend that the agreement amounts to a
technological giveaway that will enable the Japanese to compete more
effectively against this country in the global aviation market. They
argue that Tokyo should purchase American-made fighters to help
offset the $50 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   General Dynamics, this country's No. 2 defense contractor, has
said that under the deal, it and other U.S. companies will receive
35 percent to 45 percent of the $1.2 billion being spent on
development of the FSX as well as a comparable share of the $5
billion production program.

   It was about the time someone started
pouring sand from an ashtry on top of his head that combative
television talk-show host Morton Downey Jr. realized something was
wrong.
   Downey, 55, had already allowed a performance artist to wrap a
telephone cord around his neck, but executive producer Bill Boggs
said he decided to stop taping the show Friday when the artist began
showering Downey with sand.
   The artist, Mark Kostabi, 30, also threw paint on a studio camera
as part of the show on ``Artists Defending Their Art.''
   ``It's a case of an artist I think starting out thinking he's
doing something funny (but) really hurting people.'' Boggs said.
``Everything was under control except that he (Kostabi) hurt Mort.''
   Downey injured his right thumb as he helped security guards
remove Kostabi from the WWOR studio, and was treated and released
from the Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center, Boggs said.
   Boggs said Kostabi later telephoned the show and offered to pay
for the camera. Kostabi has an unlisted phone number and could not
be reached for comment.

   ``Today'' show co-host Bryant Gumbel,
taking part in a golf tournament in this desert resort near Palm
Springs, declined to comment on the furor over his criticism of most
of the show's personalities.
   ``Not a chance, not a chance,'' Gumbel said Friday when asked to
comment on reaction to his comments about ``Today'' show staffers.
   The memo, written last August by Gumbel to ``Today'' Executive
Producer Marty Ryan, spared Gumbel's co-host, Jane Pauley, but
berated the work of consumer affairs reporter David Horowitz, movie
critic Gene Shalit and weatherman Willard Scott.
   While Shalit and Horowitz dismissed the complaints, Scott told
the nationally syndicated Entertainment Tonight program that he
might not be able to remain with ``Today'' if he and Gumbel cannot
reach a reconciliation.
   Ms. Pauley said the incident is best forgotten, however.
   ``This is not a national crisis,'' she told Entertainment Tonight
in an interview broadcast Friday. ``Sure it was a problem, but every
family has its ups and downs.''

   After a decade as president of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Paul E. Gray is expected to become chairman
of its governing board in July 1990.
   Gray, a 57-year-old specialist in electronic circuits and
semiconductors, will be nominated to succeed David S. Saxon as
chairman of the MIT Corporation, the institute said Friday. Saxon,
69, said he plans to retire.
   In recent years, Gray has pushed the institute toward greater
introspection, particularly on the issues of racial tolerance on
campus and the role of science in society. MIT is currently
evaluating its curriculum to strengthen its instruction in the
humanities.
   Except for two years of military service from 1955-57, Gray has
been associated with MIT since he entered as a freshmen in 1950. He
served as a professor, dean of the school of engineering and
chancellor efore assuming the presidency in 1980.

   A class in Christian protest where the
final exam may involve being arrested is teaching prospective
deacons in the Episcopal Church how to translate their faith into
action.
   ``Primarily, I'm hoping to get across that worship and liturgy
are always inherently political because it has to do with ordering
of life in the community,'' said the Rev. William Wylie-Kellerman.
   The United Methodist pastor from Detroit discussed the course on
a recent winter Saturday as he led a half-hour protest at the
University of Michigan's School of Public Health, where scientists
have conducted research involving mustard gas and nerve agent
weapons.
   Even though the class of about 25 members drew little attention
as they sang hymns and read from the Bible, Wylie-Kellerman said the
protest was important.
   ``Impact is often more than what is immediately visible,'' he
said.
   The course is offered for credit to students in the Episcopal
deacon program of the Whitaker School of Theology in Detroit, or to
anyone else who wants to transform religious beliefs into activism.
   Each class includes a Bible study and a protest worship service
against activities such as an institution's military research,
weapons construction or investments in South Africa.
   The class has been called a course in protest, but
Wylie-Kellerman refers to it as a liturgical response to militarism.
   ``Liturgy is always political because there's a fundamental
pledge of allegiance. Worship and liturgy declare an allegiance to
the sovereignty of the word of God.''
   Worship can take on a whole new meaning when a setting changes,
he said.
   ``The same identical prayer service done in a cathedral, moved to
the gates of Williams International, you're going to hear the call
for repentance in a different way,'' he said, referring to the
cruise missile engine plant in Walled Lake where he will conduct a
Pentecost service May 13.
   ``It's the same commitment and allegiance, but it just cuts you
deeper. One of my clearest personal senses involved doing an Easter
vigil liturgy at Wurtsmith Air Force Base: cutting the fence and
walking down the runway toward the high-security area, looking down
at the B-52s and renouncing Satan, renewing my commitment to
Christ.''
   Members of the class say public witness is important.
   ``We're talking about taking the gospel and trying to live the
gospel in such a way that what we do in worship really makes a
difference in the way we live our lives,'' said Joan McDonald, of
Huntington Woods. ``We're trying to make a connection between Sunday
and the rest of the week.''
   ``We need to go out of that beautiful little cocoon (a church)
onto the streets where people are killing and raping, making weapons
that are going to kill. In terms of protest, or marking particular
sites, it's making a public witness of our belief.''
   ``It's an issue of peace and justice,'' said Dave Carlson, of
Madison Heights, who hopes to become a deacon candidate. ``Bill has
taught me how to relate scripture to contemporary society.''
   Wylie-Kellerman's course will conclude in May, when members of
the class may participate in civil disobedience and could be
arrested at Williams International as many other protesters have.
   ``We're programmed to feel we don't make a difference. That type
of thinking can immobilize you,'' McDonald said. ``It's good to be
nurtured within a group, as small as it is.''

<HEAD>Archivists See Progress In Preservation of Historic Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of bewailing the disintegration of
the nation's historic records, librarians and archivists say they
are beginning to see progress toward preservation of documents
ranging from the Declaration of Independence to fashion sketches
from the 1920s.
   ``I think it's beginning to come of age after all these years of
talking about it,'' Peter Sparks, director of the national
preservation program of the Library of Congress, said after a
three-day conference on statewide preservation programs that ended
Friday at the library.
   The National Endowment for the Humanities says it has been
estimated that more than 80 million volumes in American research
libraries and more than 2.5 billion pages in state archives are in
danger of being lost because of the paper's acid content.
   Most book paper manufactured since the middle of the 19th century
has a high acid content, which helps prevent the ink from running
but also makes the pages turn brittle. In less than 100 years, they
fall apart.
   Custodians of books and records have been concerned about the
problem for years, but often have had trouble getting state and
federal money to deal with it.
   ``State legislators are interested in potholes, they are
interested in environmental problems, they are interested in nuclear
waste sites,'' said Carolyn Morrow, Sparks' deputy. ``It is not that
they don't care about history, but they sometimes have to be
educated as to why the records are important.''
   Apparently, the message is getting through.
   In 1987, for example, the New York Legislature provided $500,000
to assist libraries, historical societies, archives and similar
agencies preserve books, manuscripts, photographs, maps and other
material.
   One grant went to New York's Fashion Institute of Technology to
treat its collection of 5,568 pencil, ink, and watercolor drawings
done by anonymous studio artists from 1915 to 1929. They were
dismounted from brittle paper, mended, labeled and stored in
acid-free folders and boxes.
   Other grants went to preserve such items as farmers' account
books and tavern records from the 19th century, a Fordham University
collection including orderly books of George Washington, the
Juilliard School's collection of early and first editions of the
compositions of Franz Liszt, records of the black history of
Smithtown, N.Y., and a Yeshiva University collection detailing the
history of three organizations that helped Jews during two world
wars.
   Among other states with active programs are California,
Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey, South Carolina, Utah,
Virginia and Wisconsin, Ms. Morrow said.
   Meanwhile, Congress has increased funds for the National
Endowment for the Humanities' Office of Preservation from $4.5
million in fiscal year 1988 to $12.3 million for the current fiscal
year, which began last Oct. 1. The office supports cooperative
microfilming projects and preservation of collections.
   The National Historical Publications and Records Commission, the
grant-making body of the National Archives, has a current
appropriation of about $4 million and has funded more than 100
projects to develop government archives and records management
programs in states, counties and cities.
   ``We have had a very, very good record on this in Congress this
past year,'' despite deficit-cutting pressures to keep spending
down, Sparks said.
   The National Archives also has installed an imaging system
designed to monitor the condition of the Declaration of
Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and other basic
documents. An Archives fact sheet distributed at the conference said
the system takes pictures so precise that comparisons over time will
detect the subtlest changes in a document.
   Meanwhile the Library of Congress expects to be finished in a
month or two with an experimental program at a Houston pilot plant
on technology to remove acid from books.
   ``The technologies are starting to come up, and people are
starting to get into the mode for buying them, and pretty soon we're
going to be doing it,'' Sparks said.
   With all the progress, however, he said, ``If you look at the
general problem, it's something that we are behind on, only because
we just don't have the effort level high enough. Not everybody is on
the bandwagon yet, but people are beginning to realize this is a
problem.''

<HEAD>U.S. Facing Calls to Review Baker Debt Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The economic and social turmoil that rocked
Venezuela last week has put pressure on the Bush administration to
review Secretary of State James A. Baker's plan for dealing with the
international debt crisis facing many Latin American countries.
   ``Time is running out,'' said Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., a member
of the Senate Finance Committee and a specialist on international
debt. ``Today's crisis is with Venezuela. Tomorrow's could be
Mexico.''
   Meanwhile, the administration is moving to arrange a temporary
loan to help ease Venezuela's plight in which at least 300 people
were killed and 2,000 injured in riots in response to an economic
austerity program designed by the new government of President Carlos
Andres Perez.
   He is faced with a crushing $33 billion foreign debt owed to
international banks and other lenders.
   Treasury Department officials are putting the final touches on a
$450 million emergency ``bridge loan'' to help the South American
nation weather its economic crisis, U.S. officials have told The
Associated Press.
   The loan is part of an international package from countries
including West Germany and Japan and other lenders such as
commercial banks, The New York Times reported Saturday. Quoting
government and banking officials, it said the emergency loans could
total nearly $2 billion.
   The bridge loan is designed to replenish Venezuela's depleted
reserves over the next few months until longer-term loans from the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can be worked out.
   Under an agreement with the IMF, Venezuela agreed to adopt its
austerity measures in exchange for a $4.5 billion loan over a
three-year period. The international body is composed of 151 member
nations, but its largest contributor is the United States.
   Critics in Venezuela, and elsewhere, have pointed to the IMF's
austerity requirements as being partly to blame for the turmoil. But
its defenders contend the requirements amount to bitter medicine
that is long overdue.
   ``The country has its back to the wall and it has no other choice
than to strengthen its economic situation at once,'' said an IMF
official, who would speak only on condition of anonymity. ``We can
send a signal to the rest of the world that by working to solve its
problems, Venezuela is doing the right thing.''
   The official praised Venezuela's new government for taking action
swiftly, and emphasized that the austerity measures were of
Venezuela's own design and not imposed by the IMF. He said that in
other situations, critics of the IMF have used it as a ``whipping
boy'' to deflect criticism.
   ``They have no choice but to swallow the medicine. But if it
tastes bad, do you blame the doctor for that?'' he asked.
   One Treasury official, who also spoke privately, said that
despite the criticism directed against the IMF and other Western
lenders, Venezuela's officials have been sincere about working out
an economic reform plan.
   ``In this case, we have a real commitment on the part of Perez to
stick with this,'' the official said. ``The adjustment is painful,
no doubt about it,'' he said of the bloodiest civil unrest to strike
the country in 31 years.
   But Bradley and other Latin American experts argue that emergency
measures on the part of the U.S. and the IMF _ while welcome _
aren't adequate to deal with the financial nightmares facing
Venezuela and other heavily-indebted Latin American nations.
   Besides an urgent review of U.S. debt policy, several called for
so-called debt relief, or a reduction of the debt burden. Venezuela
is the fourth largest debtor in the region, which has accumulated
some $420 billion in foreign debt.
   Debt relief is not part of the Baker plan, put forward when the
Secretary of State ran the Treasury Department. He suggested
economic reforms in the debtor nations, coupled with assurances of
new private and public lending.
   The plan's critics point out that Latin leaders have lost faith
in the scheme, since it appears to help commercial banks while
forcing debtor nations to adopt policies that severely strain living
standards and put their democracies in peril.
   ``I think there is no way that you can expect these countries to
dig themselves out of a debt crisis through economic growth and
without some debt reduction,'' Bradley said Friday. ``We need a plan
for debt reduction. ... I have high hopes the administration will
move away from that plan to a new one.''
   Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and its subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere,
agrees there are many things the Latin American nations must do to
refocus their economies, saying he does not disagree with some
elements of the Baker plan.
   But the administration ``must do a more effective job, both
politically and economically, on the debt question,'' he said.
   Dodd faults the Reagan administration for placing too much
emphasis on the Contra battle against the Sandinistas of Nicaragua,
and not paying enough attention to the debt crisis.
   ``Venezuela should be a reminder to policy-makers in Washington
of not addressing the underlying problems of the Latin American
nations,'' Dodd said.
   Both the present U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela, Otto Reich, and a
former envoy, Viron Vaky, voiced hopes in separate interviews that
the Venezuelans will overcome the most recent turmoil.
   ``It is surprising, the volatility,'' said Vaky, who served as
U.S. ambassador during Perez' earlier term of office in the late
1970s. ``They probably didn't prepare the people well enough for
these price hikes, but I believe they'll be able to ride this out.''
   Vaky echoed Bradley's call for debt relief, calling it ``Latin
America's basic problem.''
   Reich, speaking in a telephone interview from Caracas, emphasized
Venezuela's importance to the United States, pointing out that it is
the source of 7 percent of all U.S. oil imports.
   ``We definitely want to help,'' Reich said, noting that Bush had
telephoned Perez on Friday to voice support for his reform plans.
   ``The president's call was an indication of how close our
relations are, and how we want to be of assistance. ... it is a
vital link that can't be ignored.''

<HEAD>Detroit Newspaper Merger Blocked by Supreme Court Justice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice on Saturday blocked, at
least until March 17, the partial merger of Detroit's two daily
newspapers that was to begin Monday.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in an unexpected move, said the
Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News may not start the partial
merger until the full Supreme Court considers the issue at its next
regularly scheduled closed-door conference, March 17.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist on Friday had refused to
postpone the partial merger, and lawyers for opponents to the deal
then turned to Brennan for help.
   Reporters initially had been told that Brennan was not going to
act on the emergency request before Monday.
   A federal appeals court panel here voted 2-1 to uphold
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese's decision to allow the Detroit
papers to form a joint operating agreement under the federal
Newspaper Preservation Act.
   The 1970 law empowers the attorney general to give financially
failing newspapers an exemption from antitrust laws.
   Under the joint operating agreement, the two Detroit newspapers
would combine their business, advertising and production departments
but maintain separate news and editorial staffs.
   By a 5-4 vote last month, the full appeals court refused to
reconsider the three-judge panel's Jan. 27 ruling. The appeals court
blocked the partial merger until March 6 so opponents could seek a
longer delay from Rehnquist.
   That delay was denied Friday.
   But Brennan, in a three-paragraph order issued Saturday, said he
was referring the matter to the full court.
   His order added, ``It is further ordered that the order staying
implementation of the joint operating agreement issued ... by the
(appeals court) is continued pending further order of the court.''
   A group of Michigan readers and advertisers who sued to stop the
partial merger contend that the Free Press, a morning newspaper
owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., is not a failing newspaper even though
it lost $10 million a year between 1981 and 1986.
   The opponents, calling themselves Michigan Citizens for an
Independent Press, say the Free Press and News, which lost $50
million in the same period, were unprofitable solely because both
papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out
of business.
   Gannett Co., which owns the News, is the nation's largest
newspaper publishing group. Knight-Ridder is the second largest.
   Knight-Ridder has threatened to close down the Free Press if the
joint operating agreement is not approved.
   The opponents' emergency request said the agreement ``threatens
the independence of daily newspapers in 25 cities'' where, like
Detroit, competing newspapers still exist.
   The case is Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press. vs.
Thornburgh, A-695.

   Two passenger trains collided outside London today
in an accident that killed up to 12 people, injured about 50 and
sent carriages careening into the gardens of trackside homes,
authorities and witnesses said.
   Authorities said one train hit the back of the other near the
Purley station in Surrey, on the southern outskirts of the capital.
   One train remained on the track but seven cars from the other
fell down an embankment into the gardens, the Fire Brigade said.
   There was no indication anyone was hurt in the houses, but
firefighters had to cut dozens of passengers free from the wreckage.
   There were conflicting casualty reports.
   About five hours after the 1:39 p.m. crash, the emergency room
chief at nearby Mayday Hospital, Kambiz Hashemi, said four people
died there and six at the scene. The bodies of two women were
reported at nearby St. Helier Hospital, but it was not clear whether
they were included among those dead at the scene.
   The Fire Brigade and British Rail said two people died. Fire
officials put the injury toll at 50. British Rail said 32 people
were injured.
   A spokesman for British Rail Southern Region said it appeared
that one train, traveling north to London from Horsham, West Sussex,
had been crossing from the local line to a fast track when it
collided with a train bound for London from Littlehampton, on the
south coast of England.
   ``We presume at this stage that the other (Littlehampton) train
was already on the fast lane but we do not know how they impacted,''
the spokesman said.
   On Dec. 12, a three-train crash near London's Clapham Junction
station, 10 miles to the north of today's accident, killed 35
people. Railroad officials blamed malfunctioning signals for that
crash.
   In today's accident, one train ran into the back of another,
plowed to one side, and slid down the steep embankment, Fire Brigade
divisional officer Ian Park said. Seven carriages ``slid away and
turned over,'' he said.
   Samantha Muggeridge, 16, who was waiting on the Purley platform,
said: ``A slow train was coming toward Purley station. A faster one
came up behind it and seemed to clip the back of it.
   ``Three carriages from the first train rolled down the embankment
and others stayed on the tracks but they were twisted and tilted.
   ``There was a very loud crash after the collision followed by an
eerie silence. Then doors of the train started to open and there
were shouts from inside the carriages.''
   People ran from their homes and helped evacuate some of the
injured. Other injured made their own way to safety, some apparently
driven to hospital by a man who had his car parked in the street.
   Ambulance crews raced to the scene and hospitals went on alert.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was ``very distressed'' to hear
of the train crash and was being kept informed of developments, said
a spokesman for her 10 Downing St. office.
   A public inquiry is currently under way into a Dec. 12 crash.
   State-run British Rail has blamed its own flawed system in
installing new signaling equipment for the crash.
   Railway officials believe malfunctioning signals led one commuter
train to slam into the rear of another that was stopped on the
tracks. An empty freight train on an adjacent line then plowed into
the wreckage and apparently hit some passengers who had scrambled
onto the tracks.
   The Clapham crash was the worst train wreck in Britain since
1975, when 43 people died in a subway train that crashed in a London
tunnel.

   Soldiers on Saturday blocked
roads and turned back hundreds of Israeli peace activists hoping to
meet and discuss peace with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army restricted access for
reporters while British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave
toured the Jabaliya refugee camp. At least two Palestinians were
reported shot and wounded in violent protests that broke out after
the visits.
   Angry activists of the Peace Now movement accused Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin of thwarting the meetings with Palestinians
in Arab towns.
   ``We weren't planning assemblies or marches or protests _ just
meetings,'' said Peace Now spokesman Tsali Reshef.
   One of the activists, Yochanan Spruch of Jerusalem, called the
government ``plain stupid.''
   Reshef called a Defense Ministry spokesman and demanded an
explanation for closing the roads. He quoted ministry spokesman
Eitan Haber as saying Peace Now did not receive permission for the
visit.
   Parliament member Ran Cohen accused Rabin of bowing to pressure
from right-wing Jewish settlers who oppose the peace meetings.
Settlement leaders launched a campaign Friday to stop the meetings
and urged Rabin to block the contacts, saying they would encourage
terrorism.
   A Defense Ministry official who demanded anonymity said the army
was concerned Jews would clash with fellow Jews if the meetings took
place.
   Five separate convoys of Israelis left Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa
and Beersheba for West Bank villages early on the Jewish Sabbath,
and all were stopped by army roadblocks, activists said.
   In one case, activists headed for southern Hebron abandoned their
cars at army roadblocks and walked to the village of Beit Sahour,
where they held an impromptu peace rally, Israel Radio said.
   After the Israelis left, one Palestinian was shot and wounded in
clashes with troops, a photographer said.
   ``Defense Minister Rabin is ready to let 365 days go by in which
there are dead and wounded on both sides, but he won't let even one
day go by in which the two sides talk to each other,'' said Cohen,
of the leftist Citizens Rights Movement.
   On the outskirts of Ramallah, a military officer blocked the road
with his jeep to cut off a convoy from Jerusalem. The officer told
convoy drivers that the area was a closed military zone, but troops
then waved on local Arabs and Jewish settlers.
   Members of Peace Now, which calls for Israel to change its policy
and negotiate with the banned PLO, have held numerous meetings with
Palestinians both inside Israel and abroad. Several activists have
met with PLO officials in Europe, ignoring the Israeli law barring
contacts with the PLO.
   Peace Now said it has been in contact with underground leaders of
the anti-Israeli revolt and coordinated the meetings with their
approval. At least 388 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed
in the nearly 15-month uprising against Israeli rule.
   Palestinian leaders in Ramallah distributed a leaflet directing
followers not to attack cars with Peace Now signs.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Waldegrave toured the Jabaliya
refugee camp and said Britain would contribute $870,000 to the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency, to benefit Palestinian refugees. Reporters
were not allowed to accompany him while he visited the camp outside
Gaza City.
   In a brief news conference following the tour, Waldegrave said
the continued military occupation was an ``utter impossibilty.''
Israel gained control of the territories in the 1967 Middle East war.
   After Waldegrave's departure, troops wounded a Palestinian in the
leg during a stone-throwing clash, an Arab reporter in Gaza said.

<TEXT>
   ``You think funny,'' a newspaper columnist
once told Don Parker.
   The Escambia County sheriff's deputy took that observation to
heart and has turned his funny thoughts into a secondary career as a
cop humorist.
   While some officers moonlight as security guards or bar bouncers,
Parker, now a captain, has found an off-duty niche as a talk-show
personality on local radio and cable television, a traveling
convention and banquet speaker and an author.
   Parker himself is the butt of the joke in most of his yarns, like
the one about getting his foot stuck in a door that splintered when
he tried to kick it in for a search. Other officers had to go
through another door to help extricate him.
   ``It's not supposed to happen that way, but it always has, at
least to me,'' Parker said. ``I think all of us make mistakes in the
profession. The difference is I write about mine.''
   He started by giving a humorous tone to official police reports
and now has written a book, ``You're Under Arrest _ I'm Not
Kidding.''
   The cover illustration depicts the bald, gawky and bespectacled
deputy confronting a hulking bad guy.
   Parker admits to bearing an uncanny physical resemblance to
comedian Don Knotts, perhaps best known for portraying bumbling
Deputy Barney Fife on television's ``Andy Griffith Show.''
   After getting nothing but rejection notices from big-time
publishers, Parker and his wife, Carol, formed their own company,
named it Caroldon Books after themselves and published the
autobiography on their own.
   The book has sold 1,800 copies in little more than two months,
and is starting to find its way into bookstores along the Gulf Coast.
   The book is a rapid-fire collection of true stories. Parker's
favorite is about the terrified woman who reported her house had
been invaded by an alligator. When Parker arrived, he discovered a
harmless, 6-inch-long lizard.
   Another story is about the drunk pedestrian who flagged down
Parker, off duty, in civilian duds and driving his private car, to
ask for a ride. The man said he had just wrecked his car and was
trying to avoid being caught by a state trooper at the accident
scene which Parker had just passed.
   ``Brother, this just isn't your day,'' Parker said, flipping open
his badge case after inviting the man inside and doing a U-turn.
   Most laughs, however, are at Parker's expense. He recounts
helping a motorist change a flat tire only to discover later that
the car had been stolen and the guy he had helped was the thief.
   Another time he was off duty looking over magazines at a
neighborhood drug store while it was being robbed, something Parker
didn't realize until a squad car, siren blaring, screeched to a halt
outside. By then the robber was long gone.
   Parker said the late Pat Lloyd, a columnist for the Pensacola
News Journal, was accurate when she said he thinks funny.
   ``I'm always struck by the ... sheer incongruity of what happens
to us as law enforcement officers,'' Parker said. ``It's frequently
so unlike what you see on TV.''
   ``Barney Miller'' is the exception.
   He said the comedy was the most accurate of television police
shows.
   ``The job is occasionally dangerous, frequently monotonous and
often filled with moments of hilarity which occur at the most
unexpected times.''

   Hundreds of police occupied hospitals
in the country's four main cities on Saturday to keep regular
medical services running during a five-day strike by hospital
workers.
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo sent police armed with tear gas and
M-16 rifles into the hospitals late Friday and ordered 4,000 nurses,
cooks and administrators to return to work by Monday or lose their
jobs. No violence was reported.
   ``Our purpose is to open the hospitals so that the employee who
wants to work can do so,'' Azcona Hoyo said Friday. ``The ones who
don't do it will be sanctioned or fired and immediately replaced by
someone who wants to work for the benefit of the people.''
   He said the strikers, who are demanding higher wages, were
``violating the constitution by not attending to the public health.''
   He and Public Health Minister Ramon Villeda Bermudez said the
workers would lose their jobs if the strike did not end by Monday
morning.
   Celeo Alvarez Casildo, president of the Medical and Hospital
Workers' Union, said the strike would continue. Since Tuesday,
employees have been giving only emergency care while hundreds of
people wait outside for non-emergency attention.
   ``We will continue defending our rights to the end,'' he said.
``The government promised to increase our salaries ... and it
tricked us.''
   Workers are demanding salary increases totaling $2.6 million
annually. The average Honduran hospital worker earns about $200 a
month.
   The health minister said the government can only give the workers
annual total increases of $1.5 million ``because of the grave
economic crisis facing Honduras.''
   He said the medical workers have declared some 36 strikes in the
past two years to demand what he called ``exaggerated'' salary
increases.

<HEAD>Madonna Video Withdrawn After Charges It Is Blasphemous</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The distributors of rock star Madonna's new single,
``Like a Prayer,'' decided not to release the video immediately on
Italian television because of protests from a Roman Catholic group,
news reports said Saturday.
   The conservative Catholic group Famiglia Domani charged the video
was blasphemous, and it threatened to go to court to block the
broadcast, newspapers said.
   The video was to be shown Tuesday on the popular program ``Notte
Rock'' (Rock Night) on state-run RAI television.
   Officials of Madonna's Italian record company, WEA, announced
after a meeting with RAI officials Friday they had decided ``to
suspend the television distribution of this video for some days, to
keep any more controversy from arising.''
   Representatives of Famiglia Domani acknowledged they had not seen
the video, first shown in Italy on Friday at press screenings.
   According to Italian journalists who saw the video, it shows the
following:
   The singer witnesses an attack on a girl by a group of white
boys, who then escape. A black man who arrives on the scene is
accused of the assault.
   Madonna, wearing a slip, seeks refuge in a Baptist church and
pauses before a statue of a black saint, whose face becomes that of
the accused man. The statue cries tears of blood and comes to life.
   The rock singer develops cuts in her hands resembling the wounds
of the crucified body of Jesus.
   Madonna gives the statue a kiss then goes to police and tells
them the accused man is not guilty.
   Several newspapers said the screening should put to rest rumors
the video would show Madonna as a nun romantically involved with a
crucified Christ.
   The Milan daily Corriere della Sera said State Prosecutor Alfredo
Rossini had asked to see a copy of the video Friday. Famiglia Domani
has threatened to seek court action to block broadcast of the video,
newspapers said.
   ``In reality, this scandal should deflate like a bubble,'' the
Rome-based La Repubblica said. ``But we are in Italy, and before a
problem (racism) so ably raised by the puritan moralism of the
Americans, we can be sure that the sexy slip that Madonna wore into
the church will be enough to irritate those who at all costs seek a
public scandal.''

   While the House ethics committee deliberates
behind closed doors over a series of ethics charges against House
Speaker Jim Wright, its complex probe is but part of a growing web
of political intrigue surrounding the Texas Democrat.
   Some Republicans are complaining that Wright has intervened in
the House Intelligence Committee's business to hamper a second
ethics investigation into whether the speaker last September
improperly disclosed a covert CIA operation in Nicaragua.
   And Republican political operatives have set Wright up as their
``No. 1 target'' in the 1990 elections and are using the speaker as
a centerpiece in their long-range efforts to split the Democratic
party and recapture control of Congress.
   The House speaker traditionally has been a target of the minority
party, which seeks to use him to personify the evils it sees in the
majority. But with Wright, the attack has taken on personal tones.
   While the ethics committee has given little outward hint of the
results of its independent counsel's expensive nine-month probe of
the speaker's finances, talk in House cloakrooms and corridors is
that the investigation has been extremely thorough and the outcome
will cause Wright severe political problems, if not legal ones.
   Wright is alleged to have abused his office for personal
financial gain. This includes using a congressional aide to help
compile a book on which Wright earned some $55,000 in royalties, and
using a condominium in his hometown of Fort Worth without paying
full market value.
   He also is alleged to have lobbied federal officials improperly
on behalf of Texas savings and loan institutions and lobbied for a
gas venture in which he had a financial stake.
   Wright has steadfastly denied violating any law or rule of the
House, although he has conceded he might have dome some things
differently if he had them to do over.
   Soon after the outcome of that probe is known _ expected sometime
the week of March 13 _ the ethics panel will turn its attention to
the other, less-noticed case against Wright: its inquiry into
whether the speaker violated House rules against disclosing
classified information.
   In an offhand remark last Sept. 20, Wright said he had ``clear
testimony from CIA people'' that the agency had sought to stir up
public unrest in Nicaragua to provoke an overreaction by the leftist
Sandinista government. The remark appeared to violate rules against
publicly disclosing Intelligence Committee testimony, although
Wright later denied doing so.
   That case is now ``on the back burner,'' said ethics Chairman
Julian Dixon, D-Calif., but has not been ignored. Interviews have
been conducted with Intelligence Committee staff members on the
subject, he said.
   But Republicans are concerned that a classified report on a trip
to Central America by four panel members in December has not been
forwarded to the ethics panel, in part because the lone Democrat on
the trip _ Rep. Dan Glickman of Kansas _ disagreed with the document
and declined to sign it.
   The report, according to sources, includes a conclusion that
Wright's comments had a severe chilling effect on Nicaragua's
internal political opposition, effectively shutting down public
political dissent and leading to threats of imprisonment for some
opposition leaders.
   Committee member Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., declined to comment
specifically on the report, which under committee rules is a
classified document. But he said his conversations with opposition
leaders made it clear that they were dealt a setback by news stories
about Wright's comments.
   ``It seemed to be common knowledge,'' he said in an interview.
``There was a great deal of intimidation.... There doesn't appear to
be much more desire to demonstrate for fear of repercussions.''
   Glickman acknowledged that he did not sign the report because he
disagreed with the weight given to the impact of Wright's comments,
saying he saw that as a minor portion of the trip. But he appeared
flabbergasted at the charge that the document was being improperly
withheld from the ethics probe.
   ``That's totally off the wall,'' he said. ``The committee has
been given everything they need. I don't think this (report) is
relevant.''
   Dixon would not say whether he had known about the committee's
report. But he said, ``I think all material is relevant'' to the
ethics investigation. ``In these instances, damage assessment
evaluations are routinely made. I would think that would be
relevant.''
   In recent weeks, the line between the speaker's ethics problems
and House politics has become increasingly blurred, in large part
because of the political targeting of the speaker by the Republican
Party and the admitted anti-Wright agenda of the speaker's chief
accuser, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
   Gingrich, leader of a band of right-wing House Republicans, sees
his attempts to paint the speaker as a villain as a necessary step
in creating a new political climate in the United States that could
lead to a GOP takeover of Congress.
   Gingrich's analysis has found that most of the five major
political realignments in U.S. history, there have been serious
internal splits within the majority party and a shift in public
perceptions that portrayed the majority as corrupt and illegitimate.
The attack on Wright is aimed at helping create those conditions.

   Eastern Airlines' jets sat idle in the fog at the
nation's second-busiest airfield Saturday _ but not because of the
weather.
   Striking mechanics virtually paralyzed Eastern Airlines here, and
normally bustling concourses were vacant except for pickets and
clusters of frustrated fliers.
   Many would-be passengers were trying to get to Miami for
connections to the Caribbean, where they had paid reservations on
cruise ships. Others were students heading for warmer climes over
spring break.
   Eastern, which handles about a third of the traffic through
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, originally had 278
departures scheduled for Saturday. By noon, only two planes had
left, both for Miami. One Eastern flight had arrived.
   Planes from other airlines roared on and off the runways, past
row on row of Eastern jets sitting idle.
   Airport spokesman John Braden said the effect of the heavy fog,
which could have backed up departing flights, was lessened because
of the canceled Eastern flights.
   But that was no comfort to the passengers holding Eastern
tickets. In the terminal, some played cards to pass the time while
others snoozed, using carry-on luggage for pillows. Many complained
they weren't told of flight cancellations until the last minute.
   ``I was on the phone with Eastern every day since Monday, and
they kept telling me, `It's going to fly, it's going to fly,''' said
Dick Tunner of Charlotte, N.C., who was scheduled to meet a cruise
ship in Jamaica with his wife, Grace, and had made his reservations
two months ago.
   ``We were on the phone three hours yesterday trying to get
through to them and when we did, they told us at 4:30 (p.m.) that
maybe it won't,'' he said.
   A frantic scramble ensued to get other tickets as far as Atlanta.
Later Saturday morning, the Tunners managed to get on one of the two
Eastern planes leaving for Miami, and were hoping they'd make it to
Jamaica.
   Tunner said he was sorry for those on strike. ``But if we miss
the ship, who's going to repay the $3,000 we paid for the cruise?''
he asked.
   It was suspenseful for the Tunners and the relatively few other
travelers who managed to get on an Eastern plane. Strikebreakers
loaded luggage onto a Boeing 727 for Flight 843, bound for Miami,
while Eastern waited to see if a crew would report. Waiting
passengers applauded when one pilot arrived.
   Later, the luggage was taken off and put on a smaller DC-9, which
requires a smaller crew. The flight finally left for Miami at 11:15
a.m., an hour and 45 minutes late, leaving many passengers behind.
   ``See you on the ship,'' one couple called to less-fortunate
friends who didn't get on board.
   ``I hope you're right,'' came the reply.
   A second flight for Miami and Jamaica left a few minutes later
with those who didn't get on board the first plane, but airport
officials said they did not know if Eastern would be able to get
more planes out after that.
   Machinists and pilots picketed outside the terminal and in
concourses where Eastern has flights. Nails were spread in an
Eastern employee parking lot overnight, Braden said, but he said
they were swept up and there was no damage.
   And most Eastern travelers were not going anywhere.
   ``Eastern was invisible,'' complained Kris Kiessel, a college
student from Greensboro, N.C., who was on her way to Bahamas with a
friend.
   ``We called and they said everything was normal,'' she said.
After the strike canceled her flight, she and her friend were able
to use their Eastern tickets to get as far as Atlanta on a Delta
flight.
   ``When we got here they said they could send us back home.''

<HEAD>Ed Broadbent, Leader Of Canadian Opposition Party, Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ed Broadbent, whose New Democratic Party won a
record number of seats in the last election but who failed in four
tries to become prime minister, resigned Saturday after nearly 14
years as party leader.
   ``Now is the time for renewal, now is the time to pick a new man
or a woman to take us the next step,'' Broadbent said as he
announced his resignation in an hourlong speech to leaders of the
opposition party.
   His voice breaking with emotion, Broadbent called on the
left-of-center New Democrats to fight the new conservatism he said
is sweeping Canada and widening the gap between rich and poor. One
party member attending the caucus shouted ``No!'' as Broadbent said
he was quitting.
   It was not immediately clear when the popular politician will
leave or when a party convention will be held to replace him.
   Broadbent, 52, who has represented Oshawa southern Ontario in
Parliament since 1968, spoke to 120 members of the party's Federal
Council, or governing body. His announcement followed months of
speculation about his political future in the wake of Nov. 21
general election.
   Although the New Democrats won a record 43 seats, they remained
in third place among the national political parties and failed to
win a single seat in Quebec, even though Broadbent learned French
and campaigned vigorously there.
   Only a year earlier, the party had led in public opinion polls.
   After a bitter election campaign dominated by the free-trade
agreement with the United States, Brian Mulroney was re-elected
prime minister and his right-of-center Progressive Conservative
Party won 169 seats in the House of Commons. The Liberal Party
finished second with 82 seats.
   Both opposition parties opposed the free-trade agreement, which
was supported by Mulroney. Broadbent said he favored amendments that
would protect Canadian jobs he believes will be threatened by the
accord.
   During his long tenure as party leader, Broadbent was credited
with leading his party toward the political mainstream.
   ``As in the past, when I've reached a decision, I'm very happy
and convinced that the decision I made is the right one,'' he said.
   Broadbent, whose personal popularity always was higher than his
own party's, had indicated earlier he might step down.
   After the election, he appeared tired and demoralized. He
questioned publicly whether he had the energy to continue in his
position.
   ``You have to have your whole heart and soul, in terms of
commitment, especially in national politics,'' he said in January.
   ``In terms of my disposition at this stage of my life, am I going
to go out there and give it 100 percent of my energy and whatever
talents I have? Unless a person is willing to do that, they ought
not lead a political party.''

Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Laurie Shields, a co-founder of the Older
Women's League and the Alliance for Displaced Homemakers, has died
at age 68, the league announced.
   Ms. Shields died Friday at her home in Oakland, Calif., of breast
cancer, said league spokeswoman Mary Gardner Jones.
   ``Laurie Shields was an indomitable woman who was fired by
concern for displaced homemakers and older women _ women confronted
by widowhood, divorce and sex and age discrimination,'' said Lou
Glasse, president of the Older Women's League.
   ``Women all across the country have lost a powerful force,''
Glasse said. ``She will be missed.''
   She and Tish Sommers, who died in 1985, founded the Alliance for
Displaced Homemakers in 1975 and the Older Women's League in 1980.
   Ms. Shields knew first-hand the problems experienced by both.
After her husband died in 1970 at age 71, ``she found herself unable
to get a job because of age discrimination,'' the league said in a
statement.
   The Older Women's League now has more than 17,000 members in 120
chapters nationwide, the league said.
   More recently, Ms. Shields and Ms. Sommers wrote a book called,
``Women Take Care,'' about the experience of caregivers in this
society. It was published after Ms. Sommers' death.
   During a national book tour, Ms. Shields said that the caregiving
movement should support those who choose not to be caregivers as
well as to those who do.
   ``Although I chose to be a caregiver twice ... it's not a role
that is everyone's cup of tea,'' she said. ``We must work together
to prevent society from force-feeding it to the women simply because

<HEAD>Deep Snow Staggers Midwest, Texas Shiver</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Up to 18 inches of new snow halted travel Saturday in much of the
upper Midwest, forcing nurses to call for four-wheel-drive taxis to
get to work, and a sudden cold wave shut down outdoor activities in
parts of Texas.
   Snow plows were taken off some roads because of low visibility in
blowing snow, and snow drifted back onto some highways as soon as
plows passed.
   Along the edge of the snow belt, thick fog slowed travel in
southeastern Wisconsin and delayed some morning flights at Chicago's
O'Hare airport.
   ``It's total demolition out there,'' said a police dispatcher in
fog-bound Cedarburg, Wis. ``I hear the sheriff's department is going
crazy with accidents.''
   Southwestern Minnesota was hardest hit by the snow, with 18
inches at Worthington, 16 at Wilmar and 15 at Fairmont.
Minneapolis-St. Paul got an even foot of snow.
   Plows attempted to keep major roads clear in the Worthington
area, according to the Nobles County sheriff's office, but snow
drifted back after the plows passed.
   Roger Jakel, who runs Jake's Taxi Co. in Willmar, said his
company had made 75 calls as of midday Saturday with a
four-wheel-drive taxi.
   ``This morning it was really tough getting around. It was just
deep. We're using a four-wheel-drive for our taxi business to get
the nurses to work and people like that who had to go to work,''
Jakel said.
   ``Of course, now the plows have gone by and they're leaving about
a four-foot drift on the end of everybody's driveway, so now the
streets are getting fairly good but you can't get on them,'' he
added.
   At least three deaths were blamed on the weather in Minnesota
since the snow started Thursday, including one man found in a field
who apparently tried to walk for help after his car got stuck, the
State Patrol said.
   In South Dakota, Sioux Falls had 11.9 inches of snow in three
days and Huron got 12 inches.
   Portions of Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula got an average of
8 to 10 inches of snow, the National Weather Service said, with
numerous reports of snowdrifts up to 5 feet.
   ``Of course it's a matter of opinion, but overall this is maybe
the worst weather we've had all winter,'' said weather service
meteorologist Gary Campbell in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   Northern and central Wisconsin also got heavy snow, including 15
inches at Blair and Altoona, 12 inches at Wausau and 11 at Green Bay.
   Plowing was suspended for several hours during the night on
Interstates 90 and 94 in central Wisconsin because blowing, drifting
snow cut visibility, said Ted Stephenson, maintenance supervisor for
the state Department of Transportation. Three plows were involved in
collisions.
   Southern Wisconsin got a mixture of freezing rain, sleet and
drizzle that glazed roads with more than an inch of ice in some
areas. And ice brought down power lines throughout southern
Wisconsin, causing scattered power outages, utility officials said.
   North-central Nebraska got 13 inches of snow at Chadron and 11 at
Valentine and Mullen, and some highways were closed or reduced to
one-lane travel.
   Rod Hall and his wife and two small children planned to leave
Kearney, Neb., Saturday on a trip from Indiana to California after
spending two nights in a motel because of icy, snowy roads.
   ``The traveling was just too treacherous,'' he said. ``You don't
want to be off in a ditch.''
   ``I think must people have decided to stay put,'' said Dalene
Skates, a motel clerk in North Platte, Neb. ``The wind is so bad it
is really hard to drive. Most of the problem has been cars that have
been blown into the ditch.''
   Teeth rattled instead of snakes at Taylor, Texas, just northeast
of Austin, where officials canceled the 17th annual National
Rattlesnake Sacking Championship because of a vicious cold front.
The temperature fell 34 degrees in eight hours, to a reading of 34
at noon Saturday.
   Temperatures in Oklahoma were 50 to 60 degrees colder than on
Friday, the weather service said.
   The wind chill factor in Dallas shortly after noon was 9 below
zero. Several college sporting events were canceled.
   The Six Flags Over Texas amusement park postponed its opening day
for one week for the first time in its 29-year history, and sent
workers rushing to return flowers to warm greenhouses.
   The cold also created icing problems at the Dallas-Fort Worth
airport.
   ``We have canceled approximately 50 percent of our flights for
the remainder of the day,'' said Mary O'Neill, spokeswoman for
American Airlines.

   A transient was arrested for using a cap
gun to hold up more than 60 stores, police said.
   Fernando Sanchez, 34, was arrested Friday at a hotel in La Habra,
five miles north of Anaheim, and booked for investigation of
robbery. He was held Saturday on $50,000 bail.
   Thousands of dollars were taken from florists, ice cream shops,
beauty salons and other small businesses in 11 Orange County cities
since Oct. 28, said Sgt. Chet Barry. Seventeen holdups were in
Anaheim.
   The robber, nicknamed the ``bagman bandit'' because he carried a
gun in a plastic bag, sometimes robbed both a store and customers,
Barry said.
   ``I can tell you that in the Anaheim robberies, he was averaging
anywhere from $200 to $400,'' Barry said.
   Sanchez was traced through a check taken in one robbery.
Investigators found a cap pistol apparently used in the holdups,
Barry said.
   ``It was a real good replica of a .45,'' Barry said.

<HEAD>Labor, Management Conflict Was Ready To Explode</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor-management tensions that erupted into a strike
Saturday have been building inexorably for years at Eastern
Airlines, and both sides are dug in for what could be a fight to the
end _ not just to their conflict, but to the 60-year-old airline
itself.
   ``It's a tremendously unfortunate set of circumstances that has
been developing for a while,'' said an emotional James Ashlock, an
Eastern company spokesman and lobbyist for 22 years. ``At some
point, we had to come to this.''
   Management says the company, losing more than $1 million a day,
just can't make it with its high-priced, demanding labor unions. The
workers deny that they're overpaid and say management is tearing the
company apart anyway, so they might as well stand and fight.
   ``Our people have been frustrated, they've been provoked, they've
been brutalized. They're ready for something forceful to show their
feelings,'' Charles E. Bryan, Eastern Machinists union District 100
president who joined the company as a mechanic in 1956, said before
what he predicted would be ``a wingding of a strike.''
   After a 17-month contract dispute, Eastern's largest union walked
out at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday and was quickly joined by pilots and
flight attendants. With the carrier virtually shut down, company
officials admitted they were surprised by the solidarity of the
pilots with the Machinists.
   ``I think this has been building and everybody understands the
company wants to divide the pilots and the (Machinists),'' Eastern
pilots union spokesman Ron Cole said. ``It's not a Machinists issue.
It's a Frank Lorenzo issue.''
   Bankrupting the airline ``is a very real possibility,'' Cole
said. ``But that's where the airline is headed anyway, so we can
face the music now when we have some leverage, or we can face the
music later when there's nothing left.''
   Lorenzo, the Texas Air Corp. chairman who bought Eastern three
years ago, has solidified his anti-union reputation at a carrier
that already had some of the airline industry's most recalcitrant
unions. His new management in 1987 demanded 30 percent wage
concessions it said was necessary to keep Eastern, bought on the
brink of bankruptcy with nearly $2.5 billion in debts, alive.
   The balking unions were hit with thousands of layoffs, firings
and suspensions. A flight attendant was fired after allegedly
pocketing $2 in drink money, her union said, and another was
disciplined for repeated absences after she was raped.
   Machinists' horror stories included a firing for refusing to work
overtime on Christmas, while the pilots said their ranks shrank by
more than 1,000 because of stress and forced overflying.
   The management said it was time for Eastern workers to face
reality _ they were being paid too much and were used to lax rules
that were puttin Eastern out of business.
   The company, led for more than two decades by World War I flying
ace Eddie Rickenbacker and then for a decade by Apollo 8 astronaut
Frank Borman, was slow to react to the jet age and slower still to
adjust to airline deregulation.
   Borman tried a number of innovative programs and at times seemed
a model of enlightened management in his dealings with Eastern
unions.
   But, labor leaders said, he couldn't keep his promises and
workers decided that wage givebacks they made in return for Eastern
stock and profits were going down the drain.
   ``Eastern has been a cash-flow generator for its lenders for
years, and has never been designed to make a profit,'' said Cole, an
Eastern pilot for 19 years and the son of a pilot who flew with the
airline for 38 years.
   Ashlock said the company in happier times was excessively
generous to unions that only became more militant. A major turning
point came with the 1980 election of Bryan to head the Machinists,
he said.
   Bryan, depicted by management as an ego-driven man with a
near-mad vision of running the airline himself, believes giving
employees company decision-making power improves productivity and
service. He also says the workers have more pride in Eastern than
management does.
   He has tried to organize an employee takeover of the company or
attract ``white knights'' to buy out Lorenzo. He and the other
unions have fought Lorenzo at every turn, with myriad lawsuits,
grievances and lobbying in Congress.
   But, Bryan said recently, the actions turned out to be only a
delay of the inevitable showdown as, he claimed, Lorenzo tried to
break the unions while ``cannibalizing Eastern and leaving only a
shell.''
   Texas Air made Eastern's computer reservations system a
subsidiary, reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in management
fees and loans from Eastern, and sold its profitable northeast
Shuttle service to New York developer Donald Trump, a sale that is
awaiting final federal approval.
   While Borman was able to elicit some concessions, the unions
looked at Texas Air's record and refused to give in to Lorenzo.
   He beat a strike at tiny Texas International two decades ago and
then ended a labor rebellion after his bitter takeover of
Continental by sending the carrier into bankruptcy reorganization in
1983. Labor contracts were abrogated.
   ``No one believes Frank Lorenzo will stop trying to ruin the
unions if we don't fight,'' said Mary Jane Barry, flight attendants
union president. ``At Eastern, they have continued to ask employees
to make concessions to fund mismanagement. It worked once, it worked
twice, it can't continue to work any longer.''
   ``This is really make it or break it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Transportation Chief Vows Emergency Legislation if Necessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said
Saturday the Bush administration would seek emergency legislation,
if necessary, to prohibit striking Eastern Airlines employees from
broadening their protest to ``hold American industry hostage.''
   Skinner, asked about prospective union plans to establish
secondary picket lines at other airlines and commuter railroads,
declared: ``A secondary boycott will hurt our ability to compete in
the world . ... We'll take action if labor shuts down industry in
this country. We're not going to tolerate that.''
   Skinner, interviewed on the Cable News Network, acknowledged that
a recent Supreme Court decision allowed secondary boycotts in the
transportation sector, unlike other industries.
   ``I hope the machinists don't use this anomaly in the law to shut
down American industry and hold American industry hostage,'' he
said. ``It's not fair.''
   Union officials said Saturday they were examining a number of
potential targets, airlines and railroads included, for secondary
picketing, probably to begin Monday.
   William Winpisinger, president of the International Association
of Machinists, accused Skinner and President Bush of attempting ``to
confine this dispute to a narrow arena where (Eastern owner Frank)
Lorenzo can bring all his resources to bear'' against the striking
employees.
   Winpisinger said: ``We apologize to all of those who may
ultimately be affected. We have a wide range of options, and we'll
consider those one at a time.''
   Winpisinger said the prospect of a widespread secondary boycott
was ``no greater a threat than somebody daring us to do it, as the
administration clearly has.''
   He referred to Bush's refusal a day earlier to establish an
emergency fact-finding board and thereby postpone any job actions
for 60 days.
   But Skinner said: ``This dispute has been going on for 17 months.
It's time we get it resolved. There was no guarantee that in 60 days
we're going to be any better off than we are now.''
   Moreover, said Skinner, ``We can't afford to let a company go
bankrupt in the next 60 days. Eastern doesn't have enough cash to
operate.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, noted that 34 members of the
Senate urged Bush to establish the emergency board, a procedure that
has resolved 26 of 34 previous cases without a work stoppage. ``In
this case, he's been wrongly advised,'' said Metzenbaum.
   Skinner said, ``It appears that Eastern has been flying some
flights today, and I think that with 2,200 FAA (Federal Aviation
Administration) inspectors all over the country, we can make sure
that those airplanes to do go up are safe. There's no question that
all the pilots and mechanics all have to be FAA licensed.''
   Later Skinner, went by the FAA command center in Washington to
check on the situation. While there, he telephoned FAA regional
headquarters around the nation to give employees a pep talk.
   As for plans to head off any secondary boycott with special
legislation, Skinner said on CNN: ``Why should commuters in Chicago
and in New York, and auto workers in Detroit, be involved in this
dispute? They should not.''

   The 8,500 members of the International Association
of Machinists at Eastern Airlines are divided about equally into two
categories: aircraft mechanics and ramp service workers.
   The mechanics at Eastern earn a top wage of $18.83 an hour,
compared with $16 to $20.10 an hour at other major U.S. airlines,
according to the union.
   The ramp service workers, who fuel planes, handle baggage and
drive motorized equipment on airport runways, make top pay of $15.60
an hour. That compares with $15.51 to $17.45 an hour at Eastern's
big competitors.
   The average age of Eastern Machinists is 38 to 39 years.
   The union members are predominantly male: 92 percent of the
mechanics and 86 percent of the ramp workers are men, the union says.

   There's only one catch to the free home
Robert K. Stirling is offering in central Indiana _ the new owner
has to cart away the 1,100-square-foot house with a two-car garage.
   Sterling bought the house and property for about $26,000 so he
could enlarge the medical offices of his parents, Robert and Marie
Stirling, and his sister, Nancy Stirling, who practice podiatry in a
building next door.
   ``For us to just demolish it and throw it away would cost $2,000.
Before I do that, I should see if it will work out for someone
else,'' Stirling said.
   He admitted the house needs a lot of work.
   The sagging roof needs shoring up and new shingles, and the
interior of the building has been ``stripped,'' Stirling said.
   The plain cardboard sign that has been standing since Monday has
attracted plenty of attention. Motorists drive around the block for
second peeks, and some pull up to get a closer look, he said.
   Stirling said he wants to have the house off the lot this month.
   ``We've had a lot of people ask us about it _ maybe 15 calls. So
far, there's been no firm takers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Radio Says Emergency Supplies Reach Kabul from Soviet Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet truck convoys carrying
emergency food and fuel reached the Afghan capital on Saturday,
Radio Kabul said.
   The relief convoy had been stranded at Hairatan, an Afghan
village on the border with the Soviet Union, after bad weather
closed the 250-mile Salang Highway, said the radio monitored in
Islamabad, Pakistan.
   It did not say how long the convoy had been stuck or when the
snow hit the highway, which is Afghanistan's key overland link to
the Soviet Union. Avalanches periodically shut the highway, which
cuts through the Hindu Kush mountains.
   It was along the Salang Highway that Moscow moved the remainder
of its troops out of Afghanistan on Feb. 15, after nine years of
military intervention.
   In a bid to preempt Afghan rebel attacks on departing Soviet
soldiers, Soviet and Afghan fighter jets bombed both sides of the
highway in the last week in January.
   As many as 600 civilians died in the bombing raids, said a
publication distributed by the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla group,
which operates extensively along the highway.
   Afghan Moslem guerrilla fighters, called mujahedeen, have
besieged the capital, Kabul, and blocked most roads into the city
since late last year. The fighters are backed by the United States,
Pakistan, China and several Arab states.
   There are serious food and fuel shortages in Kabul, caused as
much by an unusually bitter winter as by the rebel siege.
   A U.N. program to airlift food and fuel from Islamabad for
refugees in Kabul has been stalled because airlines refused to fly
into the city, saying it was not safe.
   Radio Kabul reported that Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
promised economic and humanitarian assistance to Afghan Foreign
Minister Abdul Wakil, who is visiting the Indian capital for
meetings with top officials.
   On the battlefield, Radio Kabul reported, government troops in
the past 24 hours killed 14 ``criminals,'' a word the state radio
uses to describe the guerrillas.
   Meanwhile, a key rebel commander in the Kabul area said in a new
report that workers last month finished building a helicopter
landing pad between President's Najib's palace and the ruling
party's headquarters. Abdul Haq said Najib had the heliport built
for a speedy escape from the capital should rebels overrun the city.
   Haq also said explosives have been planted at some military and
communications installations in the city to be detonated by remote
control by retreating government troops.
   There was no independent confirmation of Haq's claims.

   A federal drug agent whose murder touched
off a nationwide manhunt was eulogized Saturday as a ``teddy bear of
a man'' who fell victim to the violence he sought to prevent.
   About 4,000 mourners turned out for the funeral of Drug
Enforcement Agency Agent Everett Hatcher of Boonton. Hatcher was
unarmed when he was shot to death Tuesday by a man whom officials
say has ties to organized crime.
   Thousands of DEA and FBI agents and policemen from as far away as
Canada lined up in the parking lot outside St. Christopher's Church
when the hearse pulled up.
   The strains of a single bagpipe from the New York Police
Department's Emerald Society pipe band cut through the chilly air
while the flag-draped coffin was carried up the steps.
   Also present at the heavily guarded, 1{-hour service were FBI
head William Sessions, DEA chief John Lawn, New York Mayor Edward I.
Koch, and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   Father Frank Ferraioli, the family priest, described Hatcher as a
gentle and kind man who would live on in the memories of those who
met him.
   ``He was not a man of violence,'' the priest said.
   A former DEA agent and close friend of Hatcher's, Joseph
DeGenaro, recalled the slain agent as a ``teddy bear of a man'' who
loved to make people laugh and whom he remembered ``grinning from
ear to ear.''
   ``He has touched all of us and we are sad he's gone,'' he said.
``But he lives on in our minds and our hearts.''
   At the service were the slain agent's wife, Maryjane Hatcher, and
the couple's two children, Joshua, 3, and Zachary, 9.
   Mrs. Hatcher said Friday that people who use drugs must share the
blame for her husband's death.
   ``Even through the grief and our loss, I must ask the question,
who really killed Everett Emerson Hatcher?'' she said. ``Who are the
ultimate guilty parties who create the market for the poison which
he valiantly tried to remove from our society?''
   DEA officials said the investigation of Hatcher's killing was
continuing ``satisfactorily.''
   A van that was driven by the main suspect, Costible Farace, 28,
of New York's Staten Island, was found late Friday in Staten Island.
   Officials believe Farace, a paroled killer, shot Hatcher four
times during a meeting in a secluded area along an expressway on
Staten Island. Hatcher, who was wearing a radio transmitter, had
previously met with Farace several times.
   The DEA has undertaken a nationwide search for Farace. He had not
been charged with murder, but a warrant was issued for his arrest on
narcotics charges.
   New York Police Department spokesman Jim Coleman said Farace
appeared to have loose ties to the Bonanno crime family, and was
involved in a ring that transported cocaine from Florida to New York.
   Stutman said officials had gotten calls from hundreds of people
trying to cooperate with the investigation, but ``as any tedious
investigation it will take time to build a case.''
   ``We will locate Mr. Farace, you can rest assured of that,'' he
said.
   Stutman has ordered New York's 500 DEA agents to focus on the
murder until Farace is found. A nationwide search was underway.
   President Bush will visit the DEA in New York this week, a visit
expected to boost what he said was low morale in the wake of the
murder, Stutman said. DEA head Lawn said Bush also planned to meet
with Hatcher's family.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 10,000 people carrying
palm leaves, white flags and peace banners marched Saturday to
demand postponement of the presidential election and a negotiated
end to the civil war.
   Leftist rebels accused the government of bad faith in the effort
to schedule talks aimed at achieving peace. They said they are being
``pushed to continue and escalate the war.''
   The march through downtown San Salvador was sponsored by dozens
of religious, political and student organizations.
   ``Because of this unjust war, we struggle for peace,'' said the
marchers. Their column stretched for about two miles along Juan
Pablo II Avenue running through the center of the city.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, in
January proposed postponement of the March 19 presidntial election
as a first step toward ending the 9-year-old civil war. The rebels,
who had rejected all previous elections this decade as a sham, said
they would participate in and respect the outcome of the vote if it
were postponed until September to give them time to organize.
   The government of Christian Democratic President Jose Napoleon
Duarte has suggested holding it April 30.
   The guerrillas say that is much too soon. The legislature, which
is controlled by the rightist opposition and has a virtual veto
power over any postponement, insists the election be held as
scheduled.
   The FMLN, in a communique broadcast over clandestine Radio
Venceremos, said Saturday that guerrilla-government talks must be
held Tuesday and Wednesday in San Salvador if there is to be any
prospect of negotiating peace.
   The government had proposed meeting with the rebels in Guatemala.
But the FMLN insists any negotiations be ``among and in full view of
all Salvadorans.''

<HEAD>Mauritian Leader Reportedly Escapes Second Assassination Attempt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Aneerood Jugnauth has
escaped the second assassination attempt in four months, local
newspapers reported Saturday.
   Police said they arrested a man who tried to attack Jugnauth with
a razor Friday night. But they refused to release any details about
the attack or the assailant.
   Authorities said this Indian Ocan island, which boasts one of
Africa's few multiparty democracies, was calm.
   During a Nov. 6 religious ceremony, a Hindu priest attempted to
shoot Jugnauth with a pistol. The priest was disarmed and the prime
minister, who also is a Hindu like most Mauritians, was not injured.
   Motives for the attack, on which the priest faces charges of
attempted murder, remain unclear.
    Jugnauth came to power in 1982 parliamentary elections and faces
a militant opposition. But he has presided over an economic boom
that has virtually wiped out unemployment in this sugar-producing
island with its growing tourist industry.
   Most of Mauritius' 1 million islanders are Indian-descended
Hindus.

   A man has been arrested for allegedly
telling children at a school that he was going to get an assault
rifle and kill them, Los Angeles County authorities said.
   James Rollin McLane, 27, was arrested Friday and booked for
felony investigation of threatening schoolchildren, sheriff's Deputy
Hal Grant said. No weapons were found in his home.
   McLane, described as an unemployed painter, allegedly made the
threat Wednesday during recess at Grover Cleveland Elementary School.
   ``He confronted several schoolchildren through a chain-link fence
and told them he was going home to get an AR-15 rifle,'' Grant said.
``He said he was going home and would return to kill them.''
   The students told school officials. A deputy recognized the
description and McLane was arrested at his home two blocks from
school, Lt. Michael Kenyon said.
   Cleveland Elementary also is the name of the school in Stockton
where Patrick Purdy, armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, killed five
children and wounded 30 other people in January.

   It will be four years on March 11 that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev came to power in the Kremlin, instituting a policy of
restructuring the Soviet system and bringing about a greater
openness of that closed society. Following is the second of a series
of reports by AP correspondents in Moscow essaying those four years.

   Jetliners daily carry Soviets to visit relatives in
the United States and roam the shops. In Central Russia, resident
U.S. inspectors verify the scrapping of Soviet missiles. New Yorkers
along Broadway cheer the Kremlin leader.
   In four years, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``new thinking''
has brought style and substance to Soviet foreign policy, largely to
plaudits from the West. Once the domain of frowning apparatchiks
with a penchant for saying ``nyet,'' Kremlin diplomacy now proclaims
its willingness to consider any complaint, and to compromise.
   While still beset at home by a stagnant economy, ethnic unrest
and a growing impatience for more food and a better life, Gorbachev
can cite a string of impressive achievements in world affairs since
he was named Communist Party chief March 11, 1985:
   _A U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in December 1987 banning
medium-range and shorter-range nuclear missiles. It was the first
negotiated reduction in superpower nuclear forces.
   _An end to the nine-year military intervention in Afghanistan
that soured East-West relations and left up to 13,000 Red Army
soldiers dead.
   _Five superpower summits, plus good prospects for a meeting soon
with President Bush.
   _The narrowing of differences with China and agreement to hold
the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years in Beijing in May.
   When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain first met
Gorbachev in December 1984, she judged: ``We can do business
together.'' Her verdict sums up the West's attitude toward the
energetic, pragmatic communist who succeeded Leonid I. Brezhnev,
Yuri V. Andropov and Konstantin U. Chernenko.
   In a recent public opinion poll in the conservative bastion of
Orange County, Calif., the Soviet leader scored a higher favorable
rating than Bush _ 70 percent to 67 percent. When Gorbachev and his
wife, Raisa, got out of their limousine near a Broadway theater
during a December visit to New York, Americans cheered from the
sidewalks.
   Gorbachev, 58, says his brand of diplomacy forms a seamless web
with ``perestroika,'' his drive for economic and social reform at
home. ``We say honestly, for all to hear, that we need a lasting
peace to concentrate on the development of our society and tackle
the tasks of improving the life of the Soviet people,'' he said in
1987.
   In other words, reduced world tensions mean the need for fewer
guns, and that means more bread and apartments for Soviet people. A
cut of 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks in the country's armed forces,
announced by Gorbachev in December, appears motivated as much by
Soviet economic pressures as by a desire to ease East-West
confrontation in Europe.
   Conversely, Gorbachev's domestic reforms have led to improved
relations abroad and often appear motivated to dispel what he refers
to as the Soviet Union's ``enemy image.'' Some examples: the 1987
release of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei D. Sakharov from
internal exile, the freeing of more than 300 imprisoned political
and religious activists, and a marked increase in the number of
Soviets permitted to emigrate and visit relatives abroad. More than
35,000 visas were granted last year for Soviets to visit the United
States, twice the 1987 figure.
   The new face of Soviet foreign policy was personified by
Gorbachev's appointment of Eduard A. Shevardnadze to replace Andrei
A. Gromyko as foreign minister. The dour Gromyko, nicknamed ``Mr.
Nyet'' by those he faced across the negotiating table for nearly
three decades, was elevated to a ceremonial post less than four
months after Gorbachev came to power to make room for the debonaire
Shevardnadze, who pointedly has criticized the way the Soviets used
to deal with the outside world.
   In July, Shevardnadze announced that the ``class-struggle'' basis
of Soviet diplomacy, under which the Kremlin for decades labored for
the triumph of socialist revolution abroad, has given way to
``universal human values'' such as the banning of nuclear weapons
and renunciation of military force in favor of negotiation to settle
international disputes.
   Such a switch in emphasis implies a cutback in Soviet commitments
to client states, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Angola and
Mozambique. The passage to socialism by such countries was trumpeted
as a major Kremlin foreign policy success in the 1970s, but their
unproductive economies cost the Soviets dearly in economic and
military aid.
   In April, Gorbachev is to travel to Cuba, where he is expected to
outline new limits on the Soviets' largess to bolster the island's
economy and to signal to its neighbors that the Kremlin no longer
will bankroll socialist revolutions in Latin America. Gorbachev also
has indicated that economics played a role in the Kremlin's decision
to end the Afghan intervention, which one Estonian newspaper
estimates cost the Soviets $100 billion.
   However, the ``new way of thinking'' in some respects may be only
a ``new way of talking'' on some issues the new leadership has yet
to address.
   Despite Gorbachev's repeated calls for construction of a ``common
European home,'' for instance, the Berlin Wall still divides the
German city and, symbolically, the continent into communist and
non-communist camps.
   The Kremlin is seeking to become a major player in Asia, a role
that is impossible without better relations with Japan. But the
Soviets so far have failed to satisfy Japan's condition for
improving ties: renegotiation of the status of the Kuril Islands,
which the Red Army occupied at the end of World War II.
   Gorbachev has acknowledged that putting his ``new thinking'' into
action is a long-term effort, but he takes visible pride in his
successes to date. ``We believe that the situation has changed for
the better, that a window of hope has opened up a little,'' he said
last year.

   Gus Palacias didn't have to walk the Machinists
picket lines that went up Saturday outside Eastern Airlines
headquarters.
   He no longer works there.
   ``But I felt I couldn't turn my back,'' said Palacias, 62, who
retired in December 1987 after 22 years as a Machinists union
aircraft mechanic. ``This is a showdown. I truly believe we have
right on our side. It may just be a showdown to the death.''
   Faced with a foe already accused of breaking one unionized
airline, many in the 8,500-member Eastern Machinists union vow never
to swap their red strike shirts for white surrender flags in the
fight over wages and work conditions.
   Their fervor is not directed at the company, where many union
members have worked since the last strike in 1966, but on its boss,
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who acquired Miami-based Eastern
in 1986. Three years earlier, he forced Continental Airlines into
bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 to end a labor confrontation and
abrogate collective bargaining pacts.
   Frank DeMaria, chief steward of the Machinists local in Bayonne,
N.J., said while walking the picket line Saturday: ``The labor of
this country is aware of what a terrorist Frank Lorenzo is. They
consider the dispute not only against Eastern but a dispute for all
labor.''
   ``It's a war,'' said Miami baggage handler Larry Burgess. ``There
are a lot of people here ready to pay any sacrifice to win this
one.''
   Yet many fear the price may be high as the strike could drive
under the 60-year-old company with Lorenzo attempting the same
union-busting strategy used at Continental.
   ``We said we wouldn't worry until the strike came,'' said Pat
Ditzler, whose husband has worked as an Eastern stock clerk for 20
years. ``It's time to worry.''
   Wally Haber, general chairman of the Machinists' Eastern local,
said workers will receive a paycheck Friday then wait two weeks for
$100-a-week strike payments.
   Haber, however, said a decision by pilots and Teamsters to honor
picket lines could force a quick resolution, possibly by White House
intervention.
   ``I predict a 10-day strike with the pilots on our side,'' said
Haber, who fought Eastern management during strikes of six weeks in
1958 and seven weeks in 1966. ``I hope we won't kill the airline,
but Lorenzo was trying to kill us,'' said Haber.
   Eastern management, which claimed the airline has been losing $1
million a day due to high labor costs, was demanding nearly $150
million in Machinists concessions. The union rejected the demand.
   ``The emotions usually die down after the first week,'' said Russ
McGarry, the union's strike coordinator. ``Then we are faced with
the issues of trying to make ends meet at home.''
   The possible loss of paychecks holds different significance for
the union workers, who include mechanics, baggage handlers and other
ground-service workers.
   David Barr, 26, who started as an Eastern mechanic three years
ago, said he'd move on to another job if Eastern fails.
   ``We'll take the company down if we have to,'' said Barr. ``It's
come down to that.''

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo's reputation
as one of America's toughest bosses is being tested with the Eastern
Airlines strike, but so is his image as a successful airline builder.
   Since Houston-based Texas Air and its chairman took over Eastern
when it was on the brink of bankruptcy three years ago, the view of
Texas Air as the model for taking advantage of airline deregulation
has been shaken. For all its cost-cutting, Texas Air has been
posting record losses.
   Lorenzo warned Eastern's workers last week that their company
can't survive a strike by Machinists with the pilots and flight
attendants joining in. The unions are gambling that Texas Air can't
survive, either, and that Lorenzo will either yield or sell Eastern
to protect his parent corporation.
   They concede the possibility, though, that he may finish
stripping away Eastern assets and leave a shell, or take the company
into bankruptcy.
   The workers' willingness to fight Lorenzo even at risk to their
future underlines his unpopular management style. Although he bought
Eastern in February 1986 with the slogan ``we aren't union-busters;
we're airline-builders,'' Lorenzo added: ``There ain't no Santa
Claus.''
   The man recently called one of the nation's ``toughest bosses''
and a corporate ``loose cannon'' rolling on deck by ``Fortune''
magazine was born Francisco Antonio Lorenzo 48 years ago to Spanish
immigrants in Queens, N.Y., three miles from La Guardia Airport.
   At one point young Frank drove a truck and belonged to the
Teamsters union.
   Lorenzo, whose schoolboy nickname of ``Frankie Smooth Talk'' was
unearthed by Eastern labor leaders who also sport ``Stop Lorenzo''
buttons, graduated from Columbia and Harvard Business School, worked
at Trans World Airways and Eastern, then in 1971 helped buy
money-losing Texas International, which became Texas Air in 1980.
   With an inner circle of ambitious, hard-driving executives
well-versed in the ways of Wall Street and Washington, Lorenzo has
built Houston-based Texas Air with a takeover of Continental and its
swallowing of such carriers as People Express, New York Air,
Frontier Airlines and other small carriers.
   Continental has been predominantly nonunion since he got labor
contracts abrogated in 1983 bankruptcy reorganization.
   He had mounted unsuccessful efforts to take over National
Airlines and TWA when Eastern's 1986 financial and labor crisis gave
him an opening to buy the major carrier. He gave Eastern's board a
take-it-or-leave-it offer which it accepted after the Machinists
union refused to make major wage concessions.
   Lorenzo at first wouldn't deal directly with Eastern union
leaders, but late last year had dinner with combative Machinists
union head Charles E. Bryan. The meeting led only to more disputes.
   He made direct appeals to pilots and flight attendants in a homey
videotape sent to their homes last week.
   A nonsmoker, ardent jogger and married father of three daughters
and a son, Lorenzo's description of himself as a honest,
hard-working family man doesn't persuade Eastern workers who call
him a corporate terrorist they are determined to fight.

   Forty of the nation's most talented high school
scientists showed off their projects Saturday as they prepared for
an awards banquet that will distribute $140,000 in scholarships.
   During their five days in town, the students have exhibited their
projects to hundreds of people at the National Academy of Sciences
and met with President Bush as well as congressmen and senators and
scientists, said Liz Kilkenny, a spokeswoman from Westinghouse.
   The students from 18 states were selected in the 48th annual
Westinghouse Science Talent Search, which is administered by Science
Service, a non-profit institution.
   A total of 1,461 U.S. high school students entered independent
research projects for judging, and 300 semi-finalists were selected.
The final 40 were selected in January.
   The awards to be announced at a banquet Monday night include a
top prize of $20,000, two second prizes of $15,000 each, three third
prizes of $10,000 and four fourth prizes of $7,500. The other 30
will receive $1,000 apiece.

<TEXT>
   Buried deep beneath the village of Sharapova southeast of Moscow
are bunkers designed to allow Kremlin leaders to survive a nuclear
war.
   Contrast those shelters with statements by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev that a nuclear war cannot be won and should
never be fought and you face the imponderable dilemma of the nuclear
age:
   Why do the superpowers have atomic weapons and how will they use
them?
   In the Kremlin and at the White House, the superpowers are
reviewing their own nuclear doctrines. National security adviser
Brent Scowcroft is directing the U.S. effort, one that is expected
to change the defense budget, the shape of the U.S. nuclear arsenal
and American positions in arms control talks.
   U.S. and Soviet theories on the use of atomic weapons have
evolved over the decades, from the construction of the first bombs
in the 1940s until the widespread acceptance now that nuclear
weapons are too dangerous to use in war.
   ``We are profoundly devoted to the idea of a nuclear-free
world,'' Gorbachev wrote in ``Perestroika.''
   ``If the huge stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and other weapons
that have been accumulated are unleashed, nothing will remain of the
world. What we are talking about is the survival of humanity.''
   Such statements are welcomed in the West.
   But scrape away the rhetoric, and some disturbing facts remain.
   Since 1980, the Soviet Union has modernized its arsenal by adding
land-based missiles with about 1,000 warheads, including two new
mobile classes, the SS-24 and SS-25, which are not matched by the
United States.
   The United States has 12,683 boms and warheads, compared with
10,358 for the Soviet Union, according to the Center for Defense
Information, a liberal Washington lobbying organization.
   The U.S. and Soviet arsenals are designed largely for use against
the other superpower. And although they have never used them against
each other, the threat is always there, summed up in the by-word of
the nuclear age: deterrence.
   Deterrence, according to the Americans, equals MAD _ Mutual
Assured Destruction.
   Over the years the Soviets have taken a somewhat different view.
   As early as 1977, the-Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev
enunciated the ``Tula Doctrine,'' which states that a nuclear can
never be won and should never be fought. That doctrine has been
adopted by Gorbachev.
   But many Red Army officers, writing in theoretical journals and
training manuals, argued otherwise, leading many Western analysts to
conclude that Soviet war plans included a possible ``first strike''
against the United States.
   And many believed at the time that the Soviets might use tactical
nuclear weapons to try for an early victory during a war in Europe,
a view that was buttressed by the deployment of medium-range Soviet
SS-20s in Central Europe in the late 1970s. The SS-20s are being
destroyed under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treaty, signed
by Gorbachev and President Reagan in December 1987.
   The SS-20 deployment, which was criticized by Soviet journalists
like Aleksandr Bovin and reformist scholars in civilian think-tanks,
was part of a massive military build-up under Brezhnev, giving the
Soviets parity with the United States in nuclear weapons, and near
parity or superiority in conventional and naval forces.
   The Soviets now say they have adopted the ``new thinking'' of
Gorbachev and want to eliminate nuclear weapons by the end of the
century.
   But U.S. officials say the Soviets have made no move to dismantle
their long-range nuclear forces or the bunkers where Kremlin leaders
could hide in the event of war.
   The Pentagon said in its annual report, ``The Soviet Threat,''
that the first bunkers were built 40 years ago, and that ``yet
another round of construction on these complexes began in the early
1980s, when Soviet leaders were publicly emphasizing that a nuclear
war would be so catastrophic that attempts to achieve victory or
even seriously limit damage in such a war no longer made sense.''
   ``The bunkers are a manifestation of the old thinking,'' said one
of the think-tank scholars who is backing Gorbachev's campaign to
trim the military. He asked that his name not be used because the
bunkers are considered a state-secret.
   Yet, many American critics of the Pentagon are persuaded that the
``new thinking'' has taken hold in Moscow.
   John Steinbrunner, director of foreign policy studies at the
liberal Brookings Institution in Washington, said the bunkers are
not evidence of a duplicitous Soviet nuclear doctrine. Rather, he
said, they are similar in concept to the airplanes that the United
States keeps at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, waiting to
whisk top leaders out of danger in the event of war.
   ``There are very good reasons to have those bunkers in order to
stabilize your command,'' said Steinbrunner. ``If your central
command can be eliminated by pre-emptive attack, you can be knocked
out.''
   In addition to its plan to keep the president airborne during the
initial stages of a nuclear attack, the U.S. military also maintains
secure underground facilities in Colorado and other states, largely
as communications installations. The distinction is that the U.S.
system of underground facilities is not as extensive as that of the
Soviets in terms of the number of officials they would house or the
length of time they might remain in them.
   Soviet leaders have claimed that they developed nuclear weapons
in response to such bombs in the U.S. arsenal. But the memoirs of
Soviet physicists, published in the 1980s, give evidence that the
Kremlin secretly sought to be the first to develop the bomb.
   Soviet work on the bomb began in the late 1930s. Through spies,
the Soviet leadership learned in 1943 of the U.S. Manhattan Project,
and ordered physicists to speed up their work.
   After the United States dropped an A-bomb on Hiroshima in 1945,
the Soviets redoubled their efforts.
   ``Provide us with nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time.
You know that Hiroshima has shaken the whole world. The balance has
been destroyed. Provide the bomb _ it will remove a great danger
from us,'' Stalin told the physicists.
   Four years later, the Soviets tested their first bomb, according
to David Holloway, a scholar at Stanford University and author of
the book ``The Soviet Union and the Arms Race.''
   The United States, nevertheless, retained a significant edge in
the number of weapons and means to deliver them. Unable to afford
the cost of maintaining a full land army in Europe, the United
States adopted the less expensive alternative of balancing Soviet
military might with nuclear weapons. That remains the fundamental
principle of U.S. nuclear doctrine in Europe.
   Although the Red army occupied most of Central Europe after the
defeat of Nazi Germany, the American A-Bomb denied them superiority
on the continent.
   During the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet politicians and physicists
engaged in a game of geo-political chess, maneuvering to place each
other's cities, military bases and allies at nuclear risk.
   Through the '50s and '60s, the Soviets struggled to keep pace
with the U.S. nuclear arsenal, but were hamered because unlike the
Americans, they did not have bases near their adversary on which to
base bombers and missiles.
   The launching of the first man-made satellite, the Soviet sputnik
in October 1957, signaled that the Russians had the means to build
intercontinental ballistic missiles, and helped prompt John F.
Kennedy to warn of a ``missile gap'' during his successful
presidential campaign in 1960.
   In 1962, Kremlin leader Nikita S. Khrushchev tried to put Soviet
missiles within striking distance of the United States by deploying
them in communist Cuba.
   The Soviet failure in the missile crisis spurred them to achieve
strategic parity with the United States.

<TEXT>
   A newspaper Saturday quoted a PLO spokesman as
saying informal talks with U.S. officials are ``beating around the
bush'' and that ``serious'' dialogue focusing on an international
peace conference should begin.
   The comments by Yasser Abd-Rabboo, the PLO's information
department chief, were reported by the Al-Anbaa newspaper.
   Abd-Rabboo was quoted as saying the Palestine Liberation
Organization ``notified Washington a week ago that it was time to
resume a serious and in depth dialogue to prepare for an
international conference.''
   ``Dragging on with informal contacts that have been taking place
in Tunis is beating round the bush and will not help bring about a
settlement,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
   Abd-Rabboo could not be reached directly for comment, according
to an aide in Tunis, who demanded anonymity. There was no immediate
reaction from the State Department. It did not return telephone
calls from The Associated Press.
   The newspaper article was picked up by Radio Monte Carlo, whose
report was then repeated on Israel's state-run radio and television
Saturday.
   Israeli media reported that Abd-Rabboo said the PLO was not
willing to continue the dialogue with the United State under current
conditions. But such comments did not appear in the Al-Anbaa report
seen in Kuwait.
   Al-Anbaa also quoted Jamal Sourani, a member of the 15-man
Palestine Executive Committee, as saying ``the PLO expects the
dialogue to resume and take its natural course in March or April,
after the crystalization of the American attitude on Palestinian
rights.''
   The United States launched a dialogue with the PLO late last
year, ending a 13-year boycott of such talks after PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized the state of Israel.
   Israel, which considers the PLO a terrorist organization,
repeatedly has urged Washington to end the talks, citing what it
calls continuing PLO attacks.
   The State Department warned Friday that recent clashes between
Palestinian guerrillas and Israeli troops in south Lebanon could
have a negative impact on the dialogue. Israel said the Palestinians
were trying to infiltrate Israel.
   Palestinian leaders say military operations against Israel were
not included in Arafat's commitment renouncing terrorism.
   Arafat said Friday that Palestinian guerrillas will continue to
strike back during Israeli raids on their bases in south Lebanon.
Arafat's closest aide, Salah Kahlaf, was quoted as saying Saturday
that Washington is ``still hesitant'' about its dialogue with the
PLO and that was the reason for its warning.
   Radio Monte Carlo, based in Paris, also quoted him as saying,
``Military operations are not acts of terrorism.''
   ``Our definition of terrorism is very clear. Any operation abroad
(outside Israel) in which civilians, including Israelis, are killed,
is terrorism,'' said Khalaf, co-founder of Arafat's Fatah faction.
   The radio did not say where he was interviewed.

   Throngs crowding a downtown street
covered with trucked-in snow cheered Saturday as 49 mushers and
hundreds of dogs charged off on the first leg of the 1,168-mile
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome.
   The 17th annual race over the Alaska Range, across desolate
stretches and along the storm-raked coast began in clear, windy
weather at 9 a.m., with veteran musher Jerry Austin of St. Michael
first out of the chute.
   Susan Butcher, aiming for her fourth consecutive win and the
$50,000 winner's share of the $250,000 purse, was 19th to leave in
the succession of departures spaced two minutes apart. Rival Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers, the only person to win the race four times,
was No. 22.
   ``I feel great! I feel great!'' Butcher, 33, of Manley said with
a laugh as she hugged a well-wisher before the start of her 12th
Iditarod. Last year, she finished in just under 11 days and 12 hours.
   ``I think that I can take the pressure,'' she said. ``I know that
everybody's gunning for me, I know that everybody's after me, but I
don't see how they can be more after me than they were last year.''
   A temperature of 13 degrees and winds gusting to 46 mph combined
for a wind chill of minus 22 degrees at the race's start. Stronger
wind and clear skies were reported along the first stretch of the
race route.
   The snow was trucked in because the streets had been swept.
   Some observers crowded into a fast-food restaurant to stay warm
while awaiting the start. Children outside hawked Iditarod
newspapers and a man wearing a sandwich sign advertised Iditarod
photographs.
   The race, inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to Nome for a
diptheria outbreak in 1925, began in 1973.
   The number of competitors dropped this year in part because the
record cold spell of January and February prevented mushers from
giving their dogs enough training, said race manager Jack Niggemyer.
There were 53 competitors last year.
   The racers will stop at 25 checkpoints along the route, where
they will get food for themselves and their dogs. Along the way,
they will camp out or stay in homes or lodges.
   Commercial subsidies for the race have grown substantially over
the years, with money coming from a variety of sources, including
television rights, dog-food companies and manufacturers of
cold-weather gear.
   Joe Redington, the 72-year-old ``Father of the Iditarod,'' stood
by his dogs early Saturday as he waited to compete for the 15th time.
   ``I'm a little more serious this year than I have been before,''
said Redington, who has never won the race. ``I usually go out and
have a good time. I'll be a little more serious now.''
   Libby Riddles, whose 1985 victory made her the first woman to win
the Iditarod, is back after missing two of the last three races and
dropping out of a third.
   ``I'm just real anxious to get on the trail,'' said Riddles, 32 ,
of Nome. ``I feel prepared for anything.''

<HEAD>Grapes of Wrath: Vineyard Destruction Makes Soviets Whine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Excessive zeal in pursuing President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's anti-drinking drive caused the destruction of 16 percent
of Soviet vineyards, many of which weren't intended to produce wine,
a newspaper said Saturday.
   The labor daily Trud said table grapes rather than wine grapes
suffered the most during the systematic uprooting of vines spurred
by the interest in promoting Soviet sobriety.
   In 1985-87, 533,000 acres of Soviet vineyards, or 16 percent of
the total, were destroyed, Trud said. The official Tass news agency
called it a ``human folly.''
   Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol campaign in May 1985, raising
the price of vodka and other alcoholic beverages and cutting
production within two months of being named Communist Party chief.
   Since then, the Soviets have admitted they erred in treating all
alcoholic beverages alike, and have liberalized the sales of wine,
cognac and some other beverages.
   Trud said the 1985-87 drive to uproot vineyards had especially
hit the southern republic of Moldavia, one of the Soviet Union's
most celebrated wine-growing regions, the Ukraine, the Russian
federation and the Caucasus republic of Azerbaijan.
   To compound the damage, vines killed in severe winters during
those years were not replaced, and the establishment of new
vineyards was halved, Trud said.

<TEXT>
   Tow trucks hauled away the charred
husks of buses Saturday, and a shortage of coffins was reported
following nationwide riots that killed at least 300 people and left
thousands injured.
   Hospitals were crammed with victims of the four days of
disturbances _ the bloodiest in Venezuela's history. The riots were
touched off Monday by bus fare increases and evolved into nationwide
demonstrations against a government austerity program.
   Authorities loosened a curfew in the capital and reduced the
number of national guard units on the streets. Tow trucks cleared
burned buses from intersections. Long lines of people stood outside
distribution centers and the few food stores open for business.
   Residents near Caracas' central morgue said the smell of about
250 dead bodies was leading to fears of disease. News reports said
some coffins were arriving with two bodies inside because there
weren't enough caskets to go around.
   The director of the largest hospital in the city said morgue
officials called on medical officials to help them with the bodies.
   The hospital director, Dr. Carmen Chirinos, said 1,881 injured
people crowded her 700-bed Hospital Perez Carreno. She said most of
the injured were young men with bullet wounds.
   ``We've been doing very well under the circumstances,'' she said.
   President Carlos Andres Perez said at least 300 people were
killed and 2,000 injured in the riots and looting. News reports have
said several thousand people were detained.
   Insurance companies estimated damage to their clients was about
$76 million but that many looted businesses had no coverage,
according to news reports.
   Authorities pushed back a 6 p.m. curfew to 8 p.m. Friday in
Caracas and suspended it altogether in several regions of the
country.
   The military had airlifted 50 tons of food into Caracas in the
last three days, news reports said.
   Soldiers guarded vital roads, gasoline stations, food
distribution centers and government buildings, but there were fewer
armored personnel carriers and tanks in the streets.
   However, many Caracas residents still were not convinced the
violence was over.
   ``I don't know where this is going to end, but I'm sick of it,''
said Marisabel Perez, standing in the doorway of a housing project.
   Oil-producing Venezuela was for decades one of the wealthiest and
politically stable nations in Latin America. But a fall in world oil
prices, combined with debt payments, has depleted monetary reserves,
creating the economic crisis.
   Real wages have fallen by a third since 1981, and inflation is
expected to double this year to 70 percent.
   Perez said Venezuela could expect six months of economic hardship.
   In a letter Saturday to International Monetary Fund president
Michel Camdessus, Perez said his country would continue to follow an
IMF-mandated austerity program, but complained the fund did not take
into account local economic conditions and low world prices for
Third World exports.
   The austerity measures are required under an agreement with the
IMF in exchange for a $4.3 billion loan over the next three years.
   Perez's letter thanked Camdessus for his personal statements of
support for Venezuela following recent violence. But he complained
that the IMF-approved reforms were like trying ``to give medicine to
a patient without taking into account his organic conditions.''
   He said the reforms ``gravely affect the impoverished sectors of
the country that explode in desperation in the horrifying violence
that we saw unleashed on the streets of Caracas.''

<UNK>Fire Sweeps Into National Park And Threatens Indian Reserve ^By TODD
LEWAN ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 150 firefighters and
volunteers Saturday battled a forest fire in the Monte Pascoal
National Park, the last great wildlife reserve of Brazil's Atlantic
coastal forest and home to about 1,000 Indians.
   Firefighters have been unable to contain the blaze, which entered
the park Friday, fire chief Solange Borges of the Brazilian Forestry
Institute said.
   Borges said the fire had already destroyed more than 62 acres of
the park, which is 900 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro. He spoke
by telephone from the city of Salvador, 1,055 miles northeast of Rio.
   The park is the last untouched sanctuary for rare wildlife and
vegetation on the Brazilian coast and is home to 1,000 Pataxo
indians who live on a reserve in it.
   ``The situation gets more critical by the minute,'' said Borges.
``We're on the brink of a real emergency.''
   The fire began 28 days ago as a series of brush fires throughout
the northeastern state of Bahia. It has destroyed more than half
Brazil's Atlantic Forest, sweeping south through more than 80,000
acres of virgin wilderness.
   The cause of the fire was not known. But Borges said Indians
often set fire to their land at the edge of the forest this time of
year to renew pastures.
   ``Our biggest worry is that the fire will grow so strong that it
takes over the reserve,'' Borges said. ``The fire is a lot stronger
than it was a week ago.''
   Civil defense workers and local residents battled the fire Friday
with helicopters, tractors and sprinkler systems, Borges said.
   But their efforts have been hampered by dry weather. In addition,
the Indians resisted the intrusion of firefighters on their land.
   ``We're trying to isolate the fires, which are buring in four
different areas of the forest right now,'' said Borges. ``But under
these circumstances, it hasn't been easy.''
   Just 3 percent of the Atlantic Forest, which once covered about
170,000 square miles along a 3,000-mile coastal strip, remains
standing today.
   Some of the forest's rare monkeys, birds and trees, many found
nowhere else in the world, face extinction. One of the trees near
extinction is the Pau-Brasil, which gave the country its name.

   Five nuns entered their sixth month
barricaded in their monastery infirmary despite a Vatican opinion
that calls for an end to the protest and evicts two women from the
religious order.
   The Vatican told two of the women whose vows expired during the
protest that they they must leave and are no longer considered
members of the Order of Discalced Carmelites, the Paterson Diocese
announced Friday.
   Two others were told they should seek a different convent. A
fifth, a 71-year-old nun who suffers heart problems, would be
allowed to stay in the Monastery of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of
Mount Carmel, said Tim Manning, a spokesman for Bishop Frank Rodimer.
   The nuns said through a spokeswoman that the letters are a
last-ditch effort by the bishop to get them to leave.
   ``Nothing came here with a Vatican seal on it,'' said the
spokeswoman, Betty Sutton. ``It's the bishop's final trick to get
them out.''
   Five of the 13 nuns at the monastery locked themselves in the
infirmary Oct. 4. They said they feared their pending eviction for
protesting liberalizations such as television and candy, which were
initiated by the new mother superior, Prioress Mother Theresa Hewitt.
   Mother Hewitt has called the lock-in a ``scandal'' and criticized
the rebel nuns for disrupting the cloistered lifestyle at the
convent.
   Perhaps the nuns' most unwanted notoriety came last week on an
episode of ``Hooperman,'' which featured its star, John Ritter,
falling in love with a nun _ one of five on the program barricaded
in their monastery's infirmary, protesting liberalizations at the
convent.
   Rick Kellard, executive producer for the ABC series, said staff
from the show saw news reports about the standoff and thought it
would be a good way to have Ritter, who plays San Francisco
detective Harry Hooperman, fall in love with a nun.
   ``Basically the episode is about him being very attracted to
someone he can't have,'' Kellard said.
   The Rev. Timothy Dolan, a spokesman for the Vatican Embassy in
Washington, D.C., said it could take two weeks or more before an
appeal is heard by the Vatican's highest court, the Apostolica
Signitura.
   Mrs. Sutton said the nuns were surprised the controversy has
continued into its sixth month, but said they feel that indicated
the Vatican is taking the case seriously.

   The upper Midwest dug out of as much as 18 inches of snow
Saturday, and arctic air surged into the south-central states with
sleet and freezing rain and bitter cold.
   The storm in the upper Midwest left a total of 18 inches at
Worthington, Minn., over a period of three days. Heavy snow also
fell in parts of South Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Michigan.
   In South Dakota, snow fell continuously for 83 hours at Pierre,
and for 77 consecutive hours at Sioux Falls and Rapid City. In the
wake of the storm, bitter cold gripped the state with an unofficial
low of 37 degrees below zero reported at Rochford in the Black
Hills, the National Weather Service said.
   The cold wave dropped temperatures into the 30s in Texas, and
temperatures in Oklahoma were 50 to 60 degrees lower than they were
at the same time Friday.
   Strong northerly wind produced wind chill readings of 15 to 25
below zero.
   In northwestern Arkansas, ice buildup caused some trees in
northern Crawford County to bend and break, and ice began to collect
on bridges and overpasses, the weather service said.
   A winter storm watch was in effect overnight and into Sunday for
north-central and northeastern Arkansas and western Tennessee.
   Winter storm watches were in effect overnight and into Sunday for
much of central and eastern Missouri, northern and central Illinois
and southeastern Wisconsin.
   Wet weather prevailed across much of the eastern half of the
nation.
   Showers were scattered from the lower Mississippi Valley to the
southern and middle Atlantic Coast. Thunderstorms were scattered
from eastern Texas to southwestern Missouri, and from Alabama to
western Kentucky.
   A new storm began to spread rain and high wind over coastal areas
of the Pacific Northwest and showers moved over northern California
and western Oregon.
   A winter storm watch was in effect overnight and into Sunday for
the northern Idaho Panhandle.
   Record lows included 19 degrees below zero at Billings, Mont.; 15
below at Casper, Wyo.; 9 below at Cheyenne, Wyo.; 19 below at
Helena, Mont.; 8 below at Missoula, Mont., and 10 below at
Scottsbluff, Neb.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 8
degrees below zero at Dillon and Miles City, Mont., to 88 at St.
Petersburg, Fla. Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 31 below
zero at Bozeman, Mont., and Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.
   For Sunday, snow was forecast from the upper Great Lakes to
Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. Snow and freezing rain were forecast
over northern New England. Showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from Louisiana to the southern and mid Atlantic Coast states and
southern New England. Rain also was forecast over the northern and
central Pacific Coast region.
   Highs only in the teens were predicted from the lower Missouri
Valley to the upper Mississippi Valley; in the 20s from northern New
England through the upper Great Lakes to Oklahoma and the central
and northern Plains; above 50 from the Pacific Coast through
southern Texas to the southern and middle Atlantic Coast; in the 70s
in the desert Southwest; and in the 70s and lower 80s in the
southern Atlantic Coast.

   An employee at a safe company uncovered a
40-page secret weapons report from the U.S. Department of Energy
after he drilled open a discarded safe.
   John Wilson of the Johnson Safe Co. said he found the government
report lodged between two shelves of a safe he drilled open Friday.
   The safe was in a lot of five safes bought from a Cincinnati
surplus outlet, company owner Chuck Johnson said.
   The cover of the document is dated May 24, 1988, and says
``Defense Program _ Weapons Activities.'' The words ``Working
Papers,'' ``Restricted Data'' and ``Secret'' also were stamped on
it. One handwritten word, ``Destroy,'' slants through the title.
   The report contains references to cruise missiles and bombers and
charts of weapon stockpiles.
   ``You'd have to be an expert in that field to know what it's all
about,'' said Eva Johnson, Chuck Johnson's wife. ``The average
layman wouldn't understand anything in it. It's Greek to them.''
   Johnson said he will take the report to the FBI on Monday.
   Al Taylor, an FBI agent in Cincinnati, declined to comment
Saturday on the discovery, but said FBI officials in Columbus would
be notified.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the Machinists union faced down
Eastern chairman Frank Borman and then the airline's board, and his
refusal to give in to new owner Frank Lorenzo spurred Saturday's
strike at Eastern.
   Charles E. Bryan, 55, is depicted by Eastern management as a
hate-filled, near-maniacal union boss. In a recently published,
red-colored booklet called ``Charlie Says...'', the company warns
that he will destroy the airline.
   Borman, the former Eastern chairman and Apollo 8 astronaut who
admits he was driven to tears by Bryan, recently compared him to
Peoples Temple cult leader Jim Jones, who led a mass suicide in 1978.
   But Bryan's union members trust him and follow him implicitly.
Many other Eastern employees have come to admire his persistent,
often-innovative strategies, which Bryan credits to an extensive
self-education that included study of the Bible, Zen, yoga, the
ancient Chinese handbook ``The Art of War,'' and the philosophies of
Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.
   Bryan says he has learned from studying their philosophies that
resistance based on inner good and following the right way will
triumph. His critics say Bryan's philosophy is based on egotism and
stubbornness _ or worse.
   Bryan has charged repeatedly that the Lorenzo management wants
only to bust the unions and strip away Eastern's assets before
abandoning the carcass.
   Joseph Guerrieri Jr., a veteran Washington labor lawyer who
represents the Machinists, says Bryan never ceases to impress him
with his drive and creativity.
   The divorced father of three grown children appears to have
unlimited stamina and is equally comfortable in corporate
boardrooms, courtrooms, running news conferences or leading fiery
union rallies.
   Borman says Bryan has ``a certifiably insane dream'' of running
Eastern himself.
   ``Deregulation's full impact on Eastern's fortunes and Charlie
Bryan's rise to power as a union leader arrived on the scene
virtually in tandem, twin omens of our troubled future,'' Borman
wrote in his autobiography, ``Countdown.''
   Bryan, an Eastern mechanic since 1956 and elected to head its
largest union in 1980, has been trying to spur employee control of
the company. He says workers would be more productive and provide
better service if they had more say in the company, which he says
has been pushed into financial desperation by years of poor
management.
   Bryan threatened a strike in 1983 and Borman gave in with a 32
percent raise for the Machinists. Borman says Eastern then didn't
have enough cash to withstand a strike, and that the pay demands
were irresponsible because Bryan knew Eastern couldn't afford them.
   In 1986, Eastern's board demanded 20 percent wage concessions
from its unions, saying the company would go into bankruptcy without
them. The pilots and flight attendants agreed; Bryan said no
concessions unless Borman was fired.
   The board said it couldn't allow such a demand and voted to sell
to Texas Air. Bryan sent Lorenzo a conciliatory telegram. He got no
answer and instead was stripped of his seat on the board and of
other privileges.
   That began a struggle Bryan describes as between workers whose
home has been invaded by a hostile force, even a battle between good
and evil.

   The government assured novelist Salman Rushdie of
its unwavering support Saturday, and Iran suggested London could
defuse the crisis over Rushdie's new novel by banning the book and
prosecuting the writer.
   The Indian-born author questioned government support for him
Friday after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Foreign Secretary
Sir Geoffrey Howe said Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' has offended
some Britons as well as Moslems.
   Tehran Radio welcomed their statements Saturday but demanded
Britain take ``concrete action.''
   ``The British government, by accepting that the book is
insulting, cannot object to the death sentence on the writer, which
has been issued in line with Sharia (Islamic law),'' it said.
   Iran's parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered leader
of the pragmatist camp within the Iranian hierarchy, said the rift
over the book ``seems difficult to heal.''
   ``Even if the apostate Rushdie is executed, if Britain apologizes
or if the book is withdrawn, the rift remains part of a global
arrogance plot,'' the radio quoted Rafsanjani as saying. He offered
no suggestions as to how the controversy could be resolved.
   Britain repeatedly has demanded Iran's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, rescind his Feb. 14 death sentence on
Rushdie for writing the novel, which some say insults Islam.
   The Foreign Office reiterated Saturday that Britain will not
discuss the Rushdie affair with Iran until the death threat is
withdrawn.
   Rushdie, 41, who was born into a Moslem family in India, is in
hiding. On Friday he telephoned the office of Paddy Ashdown, leader
of the centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party, and said he was
worried about the commitment of the government's support for him.
   Asked to comment Saturday on Rushdie's misgivings, Mrs. Thatcher
said: ``I want to say that the government has not changed its
position at all on this.''
   The Sunday Times reported that some British artists had
``succumbed to the climate of fear caused by widening Moslem
intimidation.''
   It said an unnamed BBC broadcaster, acting on police advice,
withdrew an article on the controversy from The Sunday Times. It
also said a painting featuring Khomeini in a critical light which
has been on display throughout Britain has been dropped from a
forthcoming exhibit at London's Covent Garden.
   The weekly Observer reported that at the British Library, ``The
Satanic Verses'' is locked on a shelf reserved for rare books and
pornography, and can only be read in a high-security reading room.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who joined Mrs. Thatcher at a
Conservative Party conference in London, was asked about reports
that Rushdie fears for his continued police protection.
   ``The protection is afforded to him by the police _ not because
he requests it, not at my direction, but because it's their
professional assessment that he needs that protection,'' he said.
   Hurd said he understood ``the hurt and insult being felt'' by
Moslems over the book, but ``the overwhelming majority'' of Britons
accept Rushdie's right to free expression.
   Tehran Radio called on the British government to clarify
``whether or not freedom of expression and writing can be a license
for defamation and insult.
   ``If the British government does not see the freedom of
expression as a license for defamation, then legal prosecution of
the author, prevention of further publication of the book, and
removing already published copies are reasonable requests which can
remove much of the friction,'' the state radio said in a commentary.
   The official Vatican newspaper on Saturday condemned ``whatever
is irreverent and blasphemous'' in Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic
Verses,'' but said its author should not be killed.
   In a front-page editorial, L'Osservatore Romano said that
millions of Moslems had found the novel offensive.
   ``However, it is not difficult to understand that the sacredness
of the religious conscience of every individual cannot override the
sacredness of the lives of other people,'' the paper said.
   Britain's chief rabbi, Lord Jakobovits, said in a letter in The
Times of London on Saturday that Rushdie and Khomeini both had
abused freedom of speech, ``the one by provocatively offending the
genuine faith of many millions of devout believers, and the other by
a public call to murder.''
   ``It should be illegal to allow either provocation to be
published or broadcast,'' he wrote.
   Moslems demonstrated against Rushdie in at least four countries
Saturday. In West Germany, 5,000 protesters marched peacefully
through downtown Bonn. But police in India lobbed tear gas to
disperse protesters who stoned cars in northern Anantang town. About
25 people were injured in the clash in Jammu-Kashmir, India's only
majority Moslem state.
   In Bangladesh, 400 people marched through Dhaka shouting ``Death
To Salman Rushdie!'' and in Thailand, 700 protesters in Bangkok
burned an effigy of Rushdie.
   Nineteen people have been killed in protests over the book.

<HEAD>Doctors Await Serum To Treat Snakebite Victim, But May Not Use It</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Physicians treating a snake-venom
researcher received a shipment of serum from Iran to counteract a
deadly viper bite Saturday, but a hospital spokesman said doctors
may elect not to use it.
   Antivenin was flown in Saturday afternoon for William E. Haast,
78, who remained in serious but stable condition at the University
of Utah Health Sciences Center after being bit on the left hand by a
Pakistani pit viper earlier in the week.
   ``The doctors are evaluating it,'' said John Dwan, hospital
spokesman. ``We're hopeful that it's not needed, but that remains to
be seen.''
   In an unusual effort initiated by Stephen Studdert, special
assistant to President Bush, antivenins effective against the bite
were located in Iran, England and the Soviet Union, and U.S. Customs
rules were waived to place the shipments quickly on flights to the
United States.
   The British shipment from the English National Poison Unit in
London arrived Friday night. But doctors did not administer it to
Haast, deciding instead to wait for the more effective Iranian
serum, said nursing supervisor Rick Taylor.
   Studdert said the shipment from the Soviet Union was being
arranged through direct, government-to-government contacts, but in
Iran, ``people-to-people, non-government'' contacts were used. There
are no formal ties between the United States and Iran's
fundamentalist Moslem government, which has repeatedly referred to
America as the ``Great Satan.''
   Meanwhile, Haast's fibrinogen level, an element in the blood that
regulates how the blood coagulates and is destroyed by the snake
bite venom, has been improving, although it remained far below
acceptable levels, according to hospital spokesman John Dwan.
   ``We have been replacing fibrinogen through transfusions and his
body appears to be making fibrinogen,'' Dwan said.
   The Iranian antivenin arrived at mid-afternoon and one of Haast's
friends transported it to the hospital. Before it is used, Dwan said
doctors would monitor Haast's condition and run checks on the
antivenin.
   ``These antivenins are not miracle cure-alls,'' he said. ``There
are negative side effects that we have to guard against.'' He said
antivenins, which are made from horse serum, can cause lung and
kidney problems.
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from California's
San Diego Zoo and from a lab in Los Angeles, but Dwan said he had
not been given antivenins for about 24 hours.
   The supply of the serum from the Soviet Union was being sent from
the Tashkent Institute of Vaccines. That serum was being flown to
Frankfurt and was expected to get to the United States late Sunday.
   Haast, director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at the
university's Research Park, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity
to withstand the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital
Wednesday after being bitten Tuesday.
   The Pakistani pit viper, or saw-scaled viper, is one of 1,000
exotic, poisonous snakes Haast keeps at the lab, where their venom
is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for
use in research and the manufacture of antivenins.

<HEAD>Former Kosovo Party Boss Leader Of Separatist Group, Newspaper Alleges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recently ousted Communist Party
chief of the restive Kosovo province was a leader of an outlawed
group seeking secession of the region from Yugoslavia, a state-run
newspaper alleged Saturday.
   The daily Vecernje Novosti claimed Azem Vlasi, who headed
Kosovo's ruling Politburo from 1986-88, was a ``staff officer of a
provincial counter-revolutionary group'' working to unite Kosovo
with neighboring Albania.
   Vlasi was among about 20 leading ethnic Albanian party officials
or company directors in Kosovo who have been arrested since Thursday
in a crackdown on ethnic Albanian dissent there.
   Most allegedly belonged to the illegal group that reportedly
planned to destabilize the province by strikes and protests and then
carry out an armed uprising that would secede the predominantly
ethnic Albanian region from Yugoslavia.
   Vecernje Novosti reported what it said were initial results of
the police investigation underway after the massive arrests and
detentions of prominent Kosovo public figures.
   The arrests came after widespread protests by ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo against planned constitutional changes they fear will limit
autonomy of the region which administratively belongs to the
republic of Serbia.
   Last Monday, emergency measures were introduced in Kosovo in an
attempt to prevent possible clashes between the ethnic Albanian
majority and the Slav minority there.
   Serbia's ambitious Communist Party boss, Slobodan Milosevic,
vowed on Tuesday at a counter-demonstration by over 500,000 Serbs in
Belgrade that the ``organizers'' of the ethnic Albanian protests
would be ``punished and arrested.''
   Vlasi, 41, was the chief opponent of Milosevic's centralist
policies and is one of the most popular leaders among about 2
million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
   For his consistent opposition to Serbia's policies toward Kosovo
he was voted out of the country's 165-member policy-setting Central
Committee in February.
   Vecernje Novosti said that Vlasi was arrested while planning to
travel to West Germany along with his wife. His two brothers are
reportedly living there.
   Belgrade newspapers said Saturday that about 50 prominent public
figures, including several provincial party officials, may face
criminal prosecution in connection with their alleged role in recent
ethnic Albanian unrest.
   Meanwhile, the official Serbian press is increasingly implying
that Yugoslavia's liberal Slovenian republic was allegedly
instigating the ethnic Albanian unrest in Kosovo.
   It has alleged that Vlasi secretly visited Slovenia last month
and that he was planning to become the director a Slovenian bank in
the provincial capital of Pristina.
   Slovenia, which itself fears alleged Serbian hegemony, has
supported ethnic Albanian demands for guarantees that the autonomy
of their province will not be curtailed by changes of the
constitution.

   A man on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list for
fleeing child molestation charges was arrested while living under an
alias at a campground, the FBI said Saturday.
   Roger Lee Jones, 43, of Sarasota, Fla., was arrested at a KOA
campgroundon burglary charges stemming from a February service
station robbery in Great Falls, 150 miles north of Butte, FBI agent
Toby Harding said.
   Jones, who used the alias Mike Andrews, admitted his true
identity in custody, Harding said.
   He was held without bond in the Great Falls jail on charges of
burglary and felony theft, and was scheduled to appear before a
Cascade County justice of the peace Monday, Great Falls police Sgt.
Russell Sinnott said.
   Harding said authorities in Great Falls and Florida will decide
whether Jones will face charges in Montana or be transported back to
Florida.
   Jones was arrested in Florida in August 1986 and charged with
three counts of sexual battery, that state's rape statute; three
counts of lewd and lascivious conduct and one count of sexual
performance by a child, Harding said. Jones fled the area after
posting bond.
   Jones was charged under federal statutes in March 1987 with
unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, and placed on the most-wanted
list last May.

<HEAD>Disillusioned Communists Quitting Party, Pravda Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Communist Party members are resigning because
they don't want to be associated with former leaders Josef Stalin
and Leonid Brezhnev, Pravda said Saturday in an article urging
Communists to face up to their painful past.
   For decades, the Soviet government hid sordid chapters of its
history and even glorified Stalin during his lifetime. But under
President Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, the
national press has been full of reports on repression and death
under Stalin and corruption under Brezhnev.
   Many older communists have reacted with shock and dismay at the
denigration of their heroes.
   Pravda, the official Communist Party newspaper, specifically
cited electrician Sergei K. Chapayev and M. Zapodoinikov, a teacher,
both from the Gorno-Altai region in western Siberia, as members who
had dropped out because they were disillusioned.
   It said others have done the same but gave no figures.
   ``All my life appears to be worthless,'' Chapayev, who was a
party member for 19 years before quitting recently, was quoted as
saying.
   ``All my life I believed, and now all is gone to ashes, and not a
blessed thing remains. Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov .... we were
singing songs about them. We believed in them more than we believed
in ourselves,'' he said.
   Vyacheslav M. Molotov, foreign minister during the prewar pact
with Nazi Germany, and Kliment E. Voroshilov were two of Stalin's
closest aides during the years when the Stalinist secret police
killed millions of Soviet citizens.
   Pravda quoted Zapodoinikov as saying, ``I cannot remain a member
of the party which had Brezhnev, Kunayev, Nasriddinova and other
scum in its ranks.''
   Dinmukhamed Kunayev and Vadgar Nasriddinova are former regional
party officials named in corruption scandals.
   Pravda correspondent E. Solomenko said the two disaffected party
members from Gorno-Altai were not isolated cases but part of a
larger problem dating back years.
   He said he remembered Leningrad party members quitting during
Brezhnev's time, saying: ``It's because we cannot live anymore in
lies and hypocrisy.''
   The newspaper said that although some might argue that the
shameful portions of the party's history should be kept quiet, true
party members should be able to stand up and face the truth.
   Admitting the truth, Pravda concluded, is painful but necessary.
   ``This is a pain similar to that which occurs when light strikes
the eyes of a man who has long been in darkness and finally emerges
into the sun, or when a doctor restores sight to a blind man, and
takes from his eyes the black blindfold. Thus goes the revelation,''
the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   The 250 Eastern Airlines machinists
in Puerto Rico joined mainland colleagues on strike Saturday, and
about 30 of them picketed the airline's San Juan terminal, the
largest in Latin America.
   About 300 passengers from four cruise ships were stranded at San
Juan's Munoz Marin International Airport late Saturday after their
Eastern flights to the mainland were canceled. Some succeeded in
securing seats on other airlines.
   Cruise ship tourists frequently end their cruise in San Juan,
where they return to the United States by air.
   Arnaldo Deleo, Eastern's sales and services director in Puerto
Rico, said ``nearly 100 percent of flights were operating'' in San
Juan on Saturday.
   On the mainland, strikers paralyzed the carrier, overwhelming
management efforts to run a skeleton domestic schedule. Most pilots
and flight attendants honored the Machinist union picket lines.
   Assistant Police Superintendent Fernando Vazquez Gely said the
picket outside the terminal at Munoz Marin International Airport was
peaceful.
   The airline, which says it is losing $1 million a day, has been
seeking $150 million in concessions from the machinists, whose union
includes mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground workers.
   Eastern handles 38 percent of the airline traffic in the
Spanish-speaking U.S. Commonwealth of 3.2 million people.
   The airline has 600 employees in Puerto Rico and has operated on
the island for 20 years. It expanded its operations last year by
building a $45 million terminal, the largest in Latin America.
   Deleo said 140 ticket and reservation agents, clerical workers
and managerial employees were trained during the last 30 days to
replace the machinists in the event of a strike.

<TEXT>
   David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klansman recently
elected to the Louisiana General Assembly, called Jesse Jackson a
``racist'' Saturday and said affirmative action and minority
set-aside programs should be abolished.
   ``I think the racists in this city are people like Jesse
Jackson,'' Duke said at a news conference after addressing the
national convention of the right-wing Populist Party of America.
   Following the news conference, Duke posed with American Nazi
Party vice chairman Art Jones, who shouted anti-Semitic and racial
slurs at reporters and got into a shoving match with a televison
reporter who asked Duke about his connection to Jones.
   The three-day convention that began Friday at a downtown hotel
was attended by about 200 people, some of whom identified themselves
as Ku Klux Klansmen and neo-Nazis.
   ``I think Jesse Jackson needs to back off his racist politics
throughout the city,'' Duke told reporters. He called affirmative
action, minority set-aside programs and integration of schools
``racially discriminatory.''
   Set-aside programs ensure that a certain percentage of federal,
state and local government contractors are minorities.
   Jackson, reached at O'Hare International Airport where he was
showing support for striking Eastern Airlines workers, declined
comment on Duke's statements, except to say, ``I don't think it's an
American point of view.''
   Duke, who ran as the Populist Party's presidential candidate in
1988, won his Louisiana Legislature seat on the Republican ticket.
He said he had agreed to address the group's annual meeting before
his victory in Louisiana.
   ``I am a Republican. I will remain a Republican despite whatever
Mr. (Lee) Atwater wants to do,'' Duke said.
   Atwater, chairman of the Republican Party, denounced Duke
following his election victory.

   A passenger train struck the back of another train
outside London on Saturday, sending rail cars careening into the
yards of nearby homes and killing at least five people, police said.
At least 80 people were hurt.
   Earlier death tolls in the capital's second major rail accident
in less than three months ran as high as 12 but could not be
confirmed.
   Scotland Yard put the confirmed death toll at five dead and 80
injured. Earlier it had said six died. It did not explain the change.
   St. Helier Hospital reported two deaths there, and Mayday
Hospital's emergency chief, Kambiz Hashemi, said three people were
dead at that hospital.
   Reports of deaths reached 12 earlier in the day when Hashemi
reported four dead at Mayday and six more dead at the scene of the
crash _ a claim that could not later be confirmed. There also was
apparent confusion over the number of times the two deaths at St.
Helier had been counted.
   Hashemi said his hospital admitted 52 casualties, 20 of them in
serious or critical condition. Twenty-four were discharged and three
transferred to hospitals specializing in head and spinal injuries.
   Firefighters had to cut dozens of passengers from the wreckage of
the trains, and authorities said some were trapped for hours after
the 1:39 p.m. collision near the Purley station in Surrey.
   Both trains originated in southeast England cities and were
traveling north to London.
   A British Rail spokesman said it appeared a train that originated
in Horsham, West Sussex, was crossing from the local line to a main
track when it ran into the back of a train that originated in
Littlehampton.
   Littlehampton is about 50 miles south of London and Horsham is
about 30 miles south of the city.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
not known why both trains were on the northbound track at the same
time.
   The trains collided a few hundred yards outside the station on
London's southern outskirts, sending several cars hurtling down an
embankment into the yards of homes, witnesses said. It was not known
if anyone was hurt in the houses.
   Several rail cars came to a precarious rest on the steep slope,
and residents were advised to leave their homes until the wreckage
could be cleared.
   Witnesses heard a deafening bang followed by silence, then shouts
and screams as passersby and residents rushed to the rescue.
Firefighters arrived and cut victims from the wreckage.
   British Rail estimated fewer than 100 people were in the trains _
the normal low volume for a Saturday.
   A three-train crash at London's busy Clapham Junction on Dec. 12
killed 35 people, and the latest disaster brought immediate
accusations by the opposition Labor Party that neglect of the
state-owned rail system was to blame.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was ``very distressed'' and
following developments, her office said. Queen Elizabeth II was said
to be shocked.
   ``I heard a loud bang,'' said Alan Long, a nearby resident. ``My
son and I brought a sledgehammer and ran over to the train. There
was blood everywhere and people screaming.''
   Passenger Derek Pearson said his car ``was tipping down an
embankment. I was trapped where I landed and showered with glass.''
   He said his train, traveling from English Channel town of
Littlehampton, was going about 60 mph.
   Tania Lawrence and her father were in the other train from
Horsham England, watching a couple across the aisle from them.
   ``She flew through the air and was knocked unconscious and he was
thrown into my lap with blood pouring out of his head. He had glass
in his eyes,'' said Ms. Lawrence.
   British Rail said engineers began a probe into the cause.
   Samantha Muggeridge, who was waiting on the Purley platform, said
a slow train was headed for the station when ``a faster one came up
behind it and seemed to clip the back of it.''
   The Dec. 12 crash in Clapham, 10 miles north of Purley, has been
blamed by British Rail on flaws in its system of installing new
signaling equipment.
   Railroad officials believe malfunctioning signals led one
commuter train to slam into the rear of another stopped on the
tracks. An empty freight train on an adjacent line then plowed into
spillover wreckage and apparently hit some passengers who had
scrambled onto the tracks.
   The Clapham crash was the worst rail wreck in Britain since 1975,
when 43 people died in a subway train that crashed in a London
tunnel.

   Jesse Jackson began a three-day fast Saturday to
urge Mayor Eugene Sawyer and mayoral candidate Timothy Evans to
unite and preserve the coalition formed by former Mayor Harold
Washington.
   ``Harold Washington died and our ship wrecked,'' Jackson told a
rally at the headquarters of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group
he founded.
   ``Rather than pick up the pieces, we chose to bomb the ship,''
Jackson said. ``Now we must build a new ship in five weeks.''
   Evans, a black Democratic alderman running as an independent,
refused to endorse Sawyer in last Tuesday's Democratic mayoral
primary, which was won by Cook County State's Attorney Richard M.
Daley.
   Jackson endorsed Sawyer, who is also black, in the primary and
now supports Evans.
   Sawyer has so far declined to endorse Evans for the general
election April 4.
   ``Division is our problem; unity and coalition are our
solution,'' Jackson said. ``An Evans-Sawyer summit is essential.''
   Washington, the city's first black mayor, died in November 1987.
The election this spring is to fill the remaining two years of his
second term.
   After Washington's death, Sawyer, a former alderman, was selected
acting mayor by the City Council. Daley, who is white, is the son of
the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, who ruled Chicago for 21 years.
   Former Alderman Edward Vrdolyak, who was Washington's archrival
while a Democrat, won the Republican primary Tuesday. Vrdolyak is
white.
   ``There are those who say the only issue in the campaign is
race,'' Jackson said. ``That's not true, but it's a major issue. The
issue is not black and white; it's backward and forward.''
   Sawyer was out of the country and could not be reached for
comment, but spokesman Monroe Anderson said he doubted Jackson's
appeal would persuade Sawyer to endorse Evans.
   ``The mayor has indicated that he's going to remain neutral,''
Anderson said. ``He just wants to remain above the fray.''
   Evans spokesman Rene Camargo said the alderman was campaigning
and could not be reached for comment.
   Jackson defended his support of Evans over Daley, the Democratic
nominee, saying that Daley did not support Washington in the 1987
election campaign, and that Daley did not support Jackson's own bid
for the presidency.
   ``I support fairness. I support coalition,'' Jackson said. ``But
I am not a masochist. I support fairness and reciprocity in return.''
   Daley spokeswoman Avis LaVelle said Daley was out of town and
could not be reached for comment, but said Daley had asked Sawyer to
support the Democratic nominee.
   ``We see that Reverend Jackson's influence was not very
persuasive when he asked Tim Evans to support Eugene Sawyer,'' Ms.
LaVelle said. ``It remains to be seen what effect his appeal will
have on Mayor Sawyer.''

   James Taylor had just watered his chrysanthemums
and left his greenhouse Saturday when two passenger trains collided
and half a dozen railroad cars hurtled down an embankment behind his
home.
   ``I had only been gone a few minutes when there was an almighty
bang. It was like a thunderbolt. I looked at my greenhouse and it
was flattened,'' he said.
   Rail cars had pitched down the steep embankment behind a row of
houses and come to rest upside down, one of them in Taylor's
backyard, 30 feet from the house.
   At least five people were killed and scores injured when the two
London-bound trains from southern England collided at suburban
Purley, about 12 miles south of central London. The reason for the
crash was not immediately known.
   ``I went into my garage and I got out two sets of ladders and we
used them to try and get up to the carriage doors,'' Taylor said.
``but it was difficult because one of the coaches looked as if we
put any weight on it at all that it might topple.''
   Taylor's 46-year-old son, Andrew, ran out to help.
   ``People who were injured were asking `Can you come and help me,
please help me,''' he said.
   ``I worked on one carriage (rail car), the one in my father's
garden. A girl was trapped in a luggage rack and, together with a
neighbor, I helped her free. I also gave assistance to an elderly
lady who had been badly injured and stayed with her until the doctor
arrived,'' he said.
   One man watched the collision from his bedroom window, shouted to
his wife to call the police, then grabbed a sledgehammer and headed
out back with his young son.
   Other neighbors gathered up sheets and blankets and clambered up
the high embankment to try to reach the injured.
   One woman named Annette said,``My husband went along the gardens
and began smashing windows to get people out.''
   ``We used ladders as stretchers to carry the people out,'' said
Fred Williams. ``The people were just in a big jumble, one on top of
the other.''
   Police soon were on the scene using their truncheons to break
windows. The sides of the high embankment were so steep that
emergency teams had to haul each other up using ropes secured at the
top.
   Doctors had to climb into the rail cars to treat the trapped
while firefighters cut them free.
   Because of the difficulty of getting stretchers to the scene,
rescuers used anything flat to carry the injured away _ ladders,
even a shed door.
   British Rail rescue workers in bright orange coats, and
firefighters in brilliant yellow dotted the muddy rail line.
   Meesha Footer, 18, said she saw injured people being brought from
the mangled railroad cars.
   ``I could hear people shouting and groaning,'' she said. ``There
was a lot of blood and I saw one body covered with a blanket and
there was one man with his leg hanging off.''
   Trees growing between the embankment and the houses appeared to
have prevented at least three of the cars from tumbling further down
the embankment into people's homes.
   About 20 muddy survivors limped into the nearby Jolly Farmer pub.
``There was not much I could do for them except make gallons of
coffee and let them use the telephone,'' said proprietor Nora
O'Connor.

<HEAD>Laos Postpones MIA Excavation With the United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laos on Saturday postponed a scheduled
joint excavation with the United States to search for the remains of
missing American soldiers, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok said.
   A 14-member team of U.S. experts was to fly to Laos aboard two
C-130 transport planes Sunday morning for the dig, but the Laotians
did not give the planes clearance to enter, spokesman Ross Petzing
said.
   Petzing refused to comment when asked why Laos put the project on
hold.
   However, the Laotians may have been irritated when the United
States earlier this week criticized them for allegedly failing to
cooperate in the war against narcotics.
   An annual report that Secretary of State James Baker sent to
Congress lists a handful of countries that it declares ineligible
for U.S. aid because of their support for drug trafficking.
   In the report, which was released Wednesday, President Bush
recommended that Burma and Laos be added to that list.
   The report said U.S. officials believe opium production is
expanding in Laos and that heroin is being refined there for export
through Thailand, Vietnam and China.
   U.S. officials have said there is evidence that Laotian officials
are involved in the processing and smuggling of drugs. When that
charge surfaced in last year's narcotics report to Congress, the
Laotian government issued a stern denial.
   The United States is trying to account for 547 Americans listed
as missing in action in Laos during the Vietnam war. Many were
airmen who flew reconnaissance and bombing missions.
   Laos had conducted four joint excavations with the United States.
The first one was in Feb. 1985.
   The Pentagon said the latest excavation was to have been
conducted in an area in southern Savannakhet province which a
U.S.-Laotian team had surveyed last December. However, the United
States has no record of a U.S. plane crashing there.
   Petzing said the U.S. team had planned to work 8-10 days at the
site.

<HEAD>Official Slams Breshnev; Gorbachev Approves Of Hungary's Multiparty
System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior official on Saturday said
Hungary was reduced to ``a kind of servility'' to the Soviet Union
during the regime of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.
   The comments by Central Committee secretary Matyas Szueroes came
a day after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was reported as
approving of Budapest's plans to introduce a multi-party system.
   Szueroes, in an interview in the Magyar Nemzet daily, first
praised the Soviet Union's 1945 ``liberation'' of Hungary to remove
``one of the most backward and poorest feudal-capitalist regimes.''
   However, he was reported as saying after 1948 ``relations no
longer developed in the spirit of equal rights and mutual benefits.
   ``The Brezhnev doctrine (of limited sovereignty of Moscow's
allies) caused a further deformation, accompanied by great power
aspects on the one side, and a kind of servility on the other, as
well as insistence on certain dogmas until the mid-1980s,'' Szueroes
was quoted as saying.
   Hungary's ``servility'' was not explained. But under the
leadership of former Premier Janos Kadar, Hungary heeded a Soviet
call to join in the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush the
short-lived ``Prague Spring'' reforms spearheaded by then party
leader Alexander Dubcek.
   Romania was the only Warsaw Pact country that refused to take
part in the military intervention.
   Szueroes also said, ``The antipathy and reservations with which
the Soviet Union and, in general, the socialist world, followed the
reform process in Hungary was a fundamental cause of the halt to the
reform.''
   One victim of Kadar's halt to the economic reform was Reszoe
Nyers, its chief architect, who was ousted from the Politburo in
1973. As Kadar was removed in May last year, Nyers joined the
Politburo again and now serves also in the government.
   Szueroes's comments were an indication of gradually increasing
openness in exposing the political shortcomings and economic
failures during Kadar's 32-year tenure.
   Word that Gorbachev does not oppose Hungarian moves toward
introducing a multi-party system came from Premier Miklos Nemeth as
he was traveling back to Budapest from a visit to the Soviet Union.
   ``The general secretary (of the Soviet Communist Party) welcomed
the idea of pluralism (in Hungary), since he considers the (process
of) representation, institutionalization and confrontation of
opinions and interests ... to be at the core of democracy,'' Nemeth
was quoted as saying by the state news agency MTI late Friday.
   According to Nemeth, Gorbachev said the Soviety Union seeks
pluralism within a one-party system, yet he would not reprimand the
Hungarian leadership for its decision to introduce a multi-party
system.
   But Gorbachev reportedly stressed that ``a multi-party system
should not be seen as a panacea.''
   In the interview with Magyar Nemzet, Szueroes made clear that
Hungary's political links with the Soviet bloc alliance system must
not prejudice its economic interests.
   The Hungarian economy has serious interests in its cooperation
with the Soviet Union, Szueroes was quoted as saying.
   ``This, however, must be based on economic advantages, and
affiliation with the same (Warsaw Pact) alliance system must be
clearly separated from asserting the economic interests.''
   Before he went to Moscow, Nemeth bluntly stated that COMECON, the
Soviet-dominated Eastern trading alliance, brings more disadvantages
than advantages for member countries.
   Nemeth quoted Gorbachev, too, as saying that COMECON should
undergo ``a drastic transformation.''

<HEAD>Two Arrested in Slaying of Police Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men, including an illegal alien with a
history of attacking police officers, were charged Saturday in the
slaying of a plainclothes policeman who was killed with his own
revolver, police said.
   Renaldo Rayside, 23, and Kurt Haneiph, 22, were picked up within
an hour of the shooting early Friday of Officer Robert E. Machate,
officials said.
   Rayside was charged with first-degree murder and criminal
possession of a loaded firearm _ Machate's revolver.
   Haneiph, who is also an illegal alien, was charged with felonious
assault on a police officer and criminal possession of a dangerous
weapon, police said.
   Machate, 25, was the first New York police officer killed in the
line of duty this year and the second law enforcement officer slain
in the city in less than three days. An undercover U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent was shot to death Tuesday.
   Machate lost his gun during a struggle with Rayside after the
officer and a partner stopped some men acting suspiciously at a
location known for drug deals. He died from a single bullet that hit
him in the left side, just under his bulletproof vest, authorities
said.
   Rayside, a native of Panama, served two years in state prison for
attempted robbery and assaulting a New York City police officer in
1982, said Sgt. Maurice Howard, a police spokesman.
   Several months after being freed on parole in 1985, Rayside
allegedly attacked another city police officer during an arrest on
possession of stolen property charges. He pleaded guilty to
resisting arrest and was sentenced to time served, the police said.
   Haneiph, also a native of Panama, has served prison time on
attempted murder, weapons and other charges, Howard said.

<HEAD>Dubcek Sues Party Hardliner For Slander In '68 Soviet Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Czechoslovak Communist Party chief
Alexander Dubcek has sued a longtime rival for slander stemming from
the Soviet-led invasion of two decades ago, sources revealed
Saturday.
   Dubcek filed a lawsuit last summer against former Politburo
hardliner Vasil Bilak, but well-informed sources say the case has
yet to come to court.
   Dubcek was 46 when he took over as party chief Jan. 5, 1968. He
was ousted in the wake of the Soviet-led invasion of seven months
later that crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms in Czechoslovakia.
   He alleges that Bilak slandered him by saying that Dubcek had
signed a statement in 1968 saying that Czechoslovakia was threatened
by counterrevolution.
   The charge by Bilak would run counter to Dubcek's image as a
visionary reformer who presaged the openness and reforms now
embraced by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bilak, a longtime party ideologist associated with the policies
of former Soviet leader Leonik Brezhnev, resigned from all his
political offices on Dec. 15.
   He was strongly believed to have been opposed to sweeping
economic reforms favored by former Czechoslovak Premier Lubomir
Strougal, who stepped down in October 1988.
   Bilak was one of three senior party officials reputed to have
asked the Soviets to intervene in order to crush Dubcek's liberal
reforms. The other two were the late Drahomir Kolder and Alois
Indra, who is still on the 13-man Prague Politburo.
   According to the sources in Bratislava with direct contact to
Dubcek, the onetime popular leader filed the slander charges in
summer 1988, when Bilak was still a senior member of the Prague
leadership.
   Dubcek's action was reportedly based on interviews published in
the West in which Bilak alleged that Dubcek, at a 1968 meeting with
Warsaw Pact leaders, had signed a document saying that
Czechoslovakia was threatened by counterrevolution.
   Dubcek was said to have denied the claim, insisting he had never
seen such a document.
   Both Bilak and Dubcek, who worked as a forestry employee in
Bratislava until his retirement, now live in the Slovak capital as
pensioners.
   Should the case ever reach a courtroom it would be the first
known lawsuit involving two former top-echelon Communist
functionaries.

   Crews worked Saturday to remove thick oil that
had washed in along a 2-mile stretch of shoreline, while the Coast
Guard checked damage to a tanker that spilled 33,000 gallons of oil
when it ran aground, authorities said.
   Coast Guard officials said it appeared no more oil would come
ashore, and made a major revision in the estimate of the amount of
oil spilled, which originally had been put at 117,000 gallons.
   The 800-foot tanker Exxon Houston floated free of a reef Friday
evening, about 24 hours after a storm drove it aground off a
little-used stretch of coast 15 miles west of Honolulu and its famed
Waikiki Beach.
   Coast Guard spokesman David Goff said that of 92,000 gallons of
bunker fuel oil feared lost from the tanker's ruptured fuel tank,
84,000 were found in the tank Saturday, meaning 8,000 gallons were
lost.
   About 25,000 gallons of crude oil spilled into the ocean Thursday
when the ship tore away from its mooring and floating hoses
unloading the oil pulled free.
   Some of the spilled oil washed to sea during the night, said
Randal O'Grydziak, with the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in
Honolulu.
   ``For the most part, it looks pretty good,'' O'Grydziak said.
``Mother Nature overnight has through some tide changes done away
with a lot of the (petroleum) product.''
   He said cleanup crews worked to remove oil-soaked vegetation,
soak up oil in water pools in the coral reef and rake the affected
beaches.
   The state Department of Health had closed beaches along the
soiled shoreline, O'Grydziak said.
   Libert K. Landgraf, deputy director of the state Department of
Land and Natural Resources, said there was no immediate evidence of
injury or death to marine life or birds.
   Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler flew over the tanker and
shoreline Saturday morning and said no more oil was visible around
the ship or off the coast.
   ``I really think most of it's ashore,'' Spangler said.
   Coast Guard Lt. Brad Nelson said officials at the scene believed
the pollution would be limited to the shoreline already affected.
   ``They're saying, `If you have to have an oil disaster, this is
the one to have,''' Nelson said.
   The Coast Guard's Pacific Area Biological-Chemical Strike Team
arrived from San Francisco late Friday and was standing by with a
floating boom that skims oil off the ocean surface, Nelson said.
   He said the team had not decided whether to use the 612-foot
boom, which is towed between two ships.
   The Clean Islands Council, a Hawaii oil spill cleanup
cooperative, was contracted to perform the cleanup by Exxon Co. USA,
the Houston-based domestic oil and gas division of Exxon Corp. Exxon
Co. USA, will pay for the costs of the cleanup, according to Exxon
attorney Leonard Alcantara.
   Officials had planned to wait until high tide early Saturday to
attempt to remove the tanker from the reef.
   But it floated free on its own late Friday after workers pumped
off more than 9,400 tons of ballast water and some of the remaining
3.8 million gallons of crude oil, lightening the ship to prevent
more crude oil or ship's fuel from spilling, said Scott Hartvigsen,
another Coast Guard spokesman.
   The tanker was moved to deep water five miles offshore and a Navy
ship and three tugboats had lines attached to the vessel, Nelson
said. A Coast Guard cutter and Navy salvage ship also were with the
ship.
   There was no problem keeping the tanker afloat, Nelson said.
   The ship ran aground late Thursday after high wind and rough seas
tore it from its offshore mooring.
   The Exxon Houston had unloaded 400,000 barrels of Alaska crude
oil at the mooring a mile off the Hawaiian Independent Refinery at
the time, said Capt. Gordon Piche, commander of the Coast Guard's
Marine Safey Office.

   Bangladesh on Saturday asked U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to help mobilize
international support for solving the country's perennial flood
problems, an official said.
   Perez de Cuellar, who has visited India and will fly to Nepal on
Monday as part of a tour of the region, met Foreign Minister Anisul
Islam Mahmoud and responded favorably, according to a source who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The source, who is close to the talks, gave no further details.
   More than 1,400 people were killed and 25 million were left
homeless last summer when floods submerged three-fourths of this
country of 110 million people.
   Bangladesh has been seeking a regional approach, involving India
and Nepal, for solving the flood problems. India has repeatedly
rejected the idea, saying Bangladesh was trying to
``internationalize'' a bilateral matter between the two neighbors.
   Bangladesh's major rivers originate in India and Nepal. During
the monsoon season, the rivers are swollen by rains and cascade down
from the Himalayan mountains and foothills.
   Although parts of India also are prone to floods, the surging
rivers' greatest fury usually is unleashed on the low-lying nation
of Bangladesh.
   U.N. And Bangladeshi environmental and development officials have
said deforestation in India and Nepal contributes to the problem,
because of a decline in soil retention of water.
   The independent Sangbad newspaper and other Dhaka dailies
recently reported Bangladesh has drawn up a 6 billion dollar flood
control plan. The government has neither confirmed nor denied the
report.
   A joint U.N.-Bangladesh task force has said the country needs at
least 1.1 billion dollars for reconstruction and flood relief after
last year's flood.
   With a per capital annual income of about $160, Bangladesh is one
of the world's poorest nations.

<TEXT>
   Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. have
agreed to combine in an ``old-fashioned merger,'' creating an $18
billion company that would be the world's largest media and
entertainment empire, it was announced Saturday.
   The resulting conglomerate, Time Warner Inc., would include
publishing, film and music interests with estimated annual revenue
of $10 billion, the companies said.
   The company would surpass Rupert Murdoch's Australian-based News
Corp. as the world's biggest company in the field of media and
entertainment, which are two of the United States' most successful
exports.
   ``There's never been a deal like this in the media business. This
is going to be a frighteningly powerful company,'' said John S.
Reidy, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Some of America's most famous names would combine forces if the
deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval, is
consummated.
   Time is the nation's leading magazine company, with such titles
as Time, People and Sports Illustrated, along with Time-Life Books
and the Book-of-the-Month Club.
   Time also owns two of the nation's largest pay-cable television
networks, HBO and Cinemax.
   Warner has major movie and television production interests,
including Warner Brothers and Warner Brothers Television and Warner
Cable Communications.
   Clint Eastwood and Barbra Streisand are regulars with Warner and
Steven Speilberg makes some of his movies for the studios. Warner's
recording artists include Madonna, Z.Z. Top, U-2, Fleetwood Mac,
Prince and Paul Simon.
   Warner, through its $1.2 billion acquisition of Lorimar
Telepictures Corp. in January, owns such TV programs as Knots
Landing, Dallas, People's Court, Alf and Falcon Crest.
   The companies' cable television properties combined would be the
second biggest in the country, behind Tele-Communications Inc. of
Denver.
   The deal is a merger of equals rather than an acquisition, and
thus cannot be directly compared to such mega-deals as the nearly
$25 billion leveraged buyout late last year of RJR Nabisco Inc. by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a Manhattan investment firm.
   The new company will have co-chief executive officers and a board
of directors made up of equal numbers named by each company.
   By merging in what is legally a tax-free pooling of interests,
the companies avoid the financial drain that usually accompanies
huge acquisitions. Glenn Britt, Time's chief financial officer,
called it ``an old-fashioned merger.''
   ``I think we can contrast this to a lot of other transactions we
see going on in America, where companies end up being over-leveraged
and so constrained they can't do anything,'' Britt said.
   ``This is a very important business for this country and we think
it's significant that we're forming what will be the largest global
media company, and that it's American-owned and U.S.-based,'' Britt
said.
   Time executives have been predicting recently that there will
eventually be about half a dozen global powers in the media and
entertainment business and have vowed to make their company one of
them.
   ``To compete in our particular business, media and entertainment,
the ability to product materials in the various forms of media and
to distribute them on a worldwide basis is critical,'' Britt said.
   Time Warner would be jointly led by J. Richard Munro, chairman
and chief executive officer of Time Inc., and Steven J. Ross, his
counterpart at Warner, according to a statement from both companies.
   ``Our complementary organizations are a perfect fit,'' Munro and
Ross said in a statement. ``Together we will be a worldwide leader
in all our businesses, enabling us to create and innovate in ways
each could only dream about before.''
   Besides Murdoch's News Corp., other big world media companies
include West Germany's Bertelsmann AG, and Gulf &amp; Western Inc. and
Capital Cities-ABC Inc. of the United States.
   The merger of the companies would continue a trend of
consolidation in the media business, marked by such deals as Sony
Corp.'s $2 billion purchase of CBS Records Inc. in 1987.
   The deal would also help protect each company against unwanted
suitors. Time has occasionally been the subject of speculation as a
takeover target, and Warner has had uneasy relations with its
largest shareholder, Herbert Siegel's Chris-Craft Industries Inc.
   Britt said the companies would be stronger together than apart
but declined to give details on plans. ``We have lots of ideas but
we feel at this point it's not appropriate to discuss things,'' he
said.
   Time would benefit from Warner's strong international
distribution, while Warner would benefit from the strong
programming, Reidy said.
   Time and Warner are headquartered within one block of each other
in Manhattan's Rockefeller Center, and the top advisers to each firm
are also within a block or two.
   Britt said negotiations on some form of business communication,
such as a merger of cable interests, had proceeded off and on for
two years. He said intense negotiations, including several all-night
sessions, occurred in the last few weeks.
   Legally, the deal calls for Warner shareholders to receive 0.465
share of Time for each share of Warner they own. Since there are
potentially 177.2 million Warner common shares, and Time closed
Friday at $109.12{ a share, that puts a value on Warner of about $9
billion if the deal had closed Friday.
   In addition, there are 56.6 million shares of Time outstanding,
giving it a market value of a little more than $6 billion based on
Friday's close.
   Debt and preferred shares account for the balance of the $18
billion market value of the proposed new company.
   Reidy said he doubted that another suitor would enter to bust up
the deal by bidding for Warner, even though the Time stock they
would receive comes to less than $51 per Warner share, not much
above Warner's close of $45.87{ on Friday.
   Warner stock rose 87{ cents Friday to a 52-week high.
   Among other things, because it is a true merger, shareholders of
the companies do not have to pay any capital gains tax on the deal.
Any would-be acquirer would have to pay a substantial premium to
make up for that tax, Reidy said.
   The companies did not give a timetable for completion of the deal.
   In a lock-up agreement designed to block outsiders from
attempting to break up the deal with a higher offer for either
company, Time and Warner agreed to exchange about 12 percent of each
other's stock without waiting for shareholder approval.

   A sea lion relocated to the Pacific Ocean in a
campaign to stop the mammals from feasting on local fish returned to
its hunting grounds here after traveling nearly 300 miles, a
wildlife official said Saturday.
   The California sea lion spotted near the Ballard ship locks
Friday afternoon was the first relocated animal to return.
   ``He obviously likes it here,'' said Bob Byrne of the state
Department of Wildlife. ``He knows a good life when he finds one.''
   The sea lions wait by the locks and pick off steelhead, a
seagoing trout, and salmon that are en route to their spawning
grounds.
   Officials have trapped 18 sea lions so far using a floating cage.
Two died after being sedated for tagging and five more were released
at the locks because of cold weather.
   To return, the sea lion had to swim about 150 miles up the coast,
turn right, swim another 100 miles through the Strait of Juan de
Fuca, turn right again and paddle the remaining 35 miles to the
locks.
   Trapping will probably resume Monday, and officials are confident
they can catch the remaining 13 or so animals, including the one who
returned, for relocation to the Pacific, Byrne said.

<HEAD>Lebanon Concerned At Reports Israel Will Expand Security Zone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moslem and Christian cabinets in
Lebanon's dual government on Saturday issued statements voicing
concern over a reported plan by Israel to expand its self-declared
security zone in southern Lebanon.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem cabinet,
told Lebanon's envoy to the United Nations, Rashid Fakhoury, to
``draw the world's attention to Israel's intentions,'' an official
statement said.
   The rival Christian cabinet of Gen. Michel Aoun, in a statement
published by the independent daily An-Nahar, expressed ``deep
concern over the statements made by some Israeli military commanders
which clearly revealed Israel's intention to widen the area of what
it calls the security zone.''
   Maj. Gen. Youssi Peled, Israel's northern front commander,, was
quoted Thursday as saying he was considering expanding the security
zone.
   Voice of the South radio, the mouthpiece of the Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army militia that operates in the zone, said Peled
wanted to include five Druse villages in the strip.
   The broadcast said the move was requested by unnamed leaders of
the Mimes, Khalwat, Ein Senta, Kfir and Ein Ata villages located in
the central Bekaa valley, a few miles north of the security zone.
   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation radio, based in west Beirut,
broadcast statements issued in the five villages that denied making
such a request or having contacts with the Israelis in the security
zone.
   ``Peled's statement reflects his intention to widen the security
zone,'' the broadcast said.
   Israel kept control of a 6-to-10-mile deep zone when it withdrew
the bulk of its occupation army from south Lebanon in summer 1985.
   The strip extending from the Mediterranean coast in the west to
the slopes of Mount Hermon in the east serves as a buffer against
cross-border guerrilla attacks on northern Israeli settlements.
   Lebanon has had rival Moslem and Christian governments since last
September, when outgoing President Amin Gemayel appointed Aoun to
head an interim military cabinet after Parliament failed to elect a
new president.
   Moslems refused to accept Aoun's appointment and pledged loyalty
to Hoss, who served as prime minister in the Gemayel administration.

   The 29th launch of Europe's Ariane
rocket was canceled three hours before lift-off Saturday night after
two cables were accidentally disconnected, officials said.
   The cables were pulled loose when the support tower was being
removed from the side of the launcher, said Frederic d'Allest,
president of Arianespace, which commercializes the rocket.
   It was not immediately clear whether the rocket could be launched
on Sunday night.
   It was the second launch postponement for the Ariane 4 rocket,
which was originally scheduled for lift-off on Tuesday but was
delayed by a strike at the launch base here.
   The cables that were accidentally detached served to ventilate
the MOP-1 European weather satellite, one of two payloads, and purge
oxygen reservoirs.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas and government officials from
Colombia on Saturday resumed peace talks interrupted by the shooting
death of a leftist leader at Bogota's airport.
   The talks were the third between the two sides this year in
search of a way to end a quarter-century of political violence in
Colombia.
   Antonio Navarro Wolf, leader of the delegation from the rebels'
April 19 Movement, told reporters before entering the talks that
rebels had ``a concrete proposal'' to present to the government.
   He did not say what the proposal contained but described it as
``what we think has to be done on an emergency basis to strengthen
and broaden this process to respond to death with life, to darkness
with hope and to war with peace.''
   Before Friday's session Wolf said the talks were intended to set
the stage for a peace agreement in Colombia.
   Rafael Pardo Ruedo, the government's representative, said the
Bogota government continued to support the talks as a move toward
peace.
   ``It is a process that can be difficult but is a light of hope
for Colombia at this time,'' he said.
   ``The road that must be followed is the road to democracy. The
majority of Colombians believe that democracy is the solution,'' he
said.
   Before entering the session at a luxury hotel, representatives of
both sides condemned the killing Friday of Jose Antequera, an
executive board member of the Marxist-oriented Patriotic Union, and
another man and the wounding of eight others at Bogota's El Dorado
Airport.
   Antequera, whose party was formed by the guerrillas, was the
apparent target of the attack, authorities in Bogota said. He had
received death threats from right-wing paramilitary organizations in
Colombia.
   He and other political leaders, accompanied by bodyguards, had
arrived at the airport to fly to Cucuta, near the Venezuelan border
and Barranquilla, on the Atlantic coast.
   An official from the Attorney General's office also was killed
and bodyguards killed one of the attackers, police said. Three other
attackers were captured.
   More than 75,000 Colombians have died in political violence in
Colombia in the past 25 years. More than 1,000 have been killed in
the last three years.
   The April 19 Movement is the largest of the six insurgent groups
and has about 10,000 members.
   The first day of talks ended early Friday when delegates learned
of the shooting.
   The talks were a continuation of meetings between the guerrillas
and government Jan. 10 and Feb. 8 in Colombia.

<HEAD>Opposition Seeks Roh's Resignation In Referendum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders agreed Saturday to
seek the resignation of President Roh Tae-woo in a referendum on his
performance the government promised to hold in April.
   Leaders of South Korea's three rival opposition parties, Kim
Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil, issued a joint declaration
after narrowing differences on key political issues.
   The three agreed on a common approach to the referendum Roh had
promised in December 1987, just before he won presidential elections.
   The declaration issued Saturday urged Roh to hold a promised
referendum after ``bringing about sizable results'' in redressing
corruption and power abuses left over from his predecessor, Chun
Doo-hwan.
   ``Otherwise, we will launch a no-confidence campaign to push for
Roh's resignation,'' it said.
   The three Kims accused Roh of insincerity in introducing reforms.
   The opposition agreement came as the government began preparing
for the referendum, aimed at seeking an early settlement of thorny
political issues without damaging its credibility.
   Senior government leaders agreed Saturday to hold the referendum
in early April, but they suggested that in the referendum, voters
should assess the administration's handling of specific issues
rather than its overall performance.
   The government party lacks broad public support, but party
leaders have said Roh is confident of victory in a referendum.
   Despite broad reforms Roh has introduced since taking office in
February, opponents have staged protests demanding his ouster.
   Recent surveys show many South Koreans believe the government
failed to take firm action to deal with past government abuses.
Dissidents and radical students identify Roh with Chun's
authoritarian government.
   Roh has asked the nation to pardon Chun since the former
president went into rural exile last November after making an open
apology for misdeeds during his seven-year administration.
   In Saturday's meeting, government leaders reaffirmed their
rejection of an opposition demand that Chun be made to testify
before the opposition-controlled National Assembly on human rights
violations and other abuses.

<HEAD>International Herald Tribune President Dies Of Pneumonia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter N. Thayer III, a lawyer, political adviser
and corporate executive who guided the New York Herald Tribune in
its declining years, died Saturday of pneumonia. He was 78.
   Thayer, who was president of the International Herald Tribune and
a partner in the Whitcom Investment Co., was being treated at New
York Hospital when he died, according to Bernard Kiernan, a
spokesman for the family.
   Thayer was a close associate of the late financier John Hay
Whitney, on whose behalf Thayer arranged for the purchase of the
financially troubled New York Herald Tribune in 1958.
   Although his first job was as a newspaper reporter and he was
involved in the news industry for much of his life, Thayer did not
fashion himself a journalist. ``I do not have printer's ink in my
blood,'' he once said.
   Kiernan said Thayer advised numerous politicians, including
President Dwight D. Eisenhower, New York Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller
and New York Mayor John V. Lindsay.
   He had a reputation as a shrewd and well-paid lawyer who drove a
hard bargain.
   In his book, ``The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York
Herald Tribune,'' Richard Kluger wrote: ``Smart, clear-thinking,
hardheaded, as personable as any man when he chose to be, Thayer
also came to be perceived as cold, guarded, very private and almost
ruthlessly dismissive of those he found unworthy or unuseful.''
   Thayer was born in Dannemora, N.Y. and, after graduating from
high school at age 16, worked as a news reporter for $12 a week on
the Ellenville, N.Y. Press.
   After earning a law degree at Yale University, he became an
assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in
1937. After World War II, he helped found the New York law firm of
Thayer & Gilbert; in 1956, he joined J.H. Whitney &amp; Co. as managing
partner.
   After Whitney purchased the New York Herald Tribune in 1958,
Thayer became its president and remained in that position until a
strike in 1966 forced the newspaper to cease publication.
   In 1967, Thayer became president of the board of directors of the
International Herald Tribune, which was formed when the Paris Herald
Tribune joined forces with The New York Times and The Washington
Post.
   Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the Times, said Thayer was
responsible for much of the Tribune's success in dealing with its
partners.
   ``Much of this was due to Walter Thayer's willingness to
listen,'' Sulzberger said in a statement. ``Further, he was blessed
by a good nose for news and high standards of journalistic
excellence.''
   Thayer is survived by his wife, the former Jeanne Cooley Greeley;
a son, Thomas of Los Angeles; and three daughters, Ann Thayer of New
York City, Susan Noble of Greenport, N.Y. and Gail Richter of
Lexington, Okla.

<HEAD>Virginia Teacher Charged With Desecrating Flag in Banner Brouhaha</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A schoolteacher in town for a seminar became
entangled in a controversy over the use of an American flag in an
art exhibit Saturday when she was arrested for walking on the Stars
and Stripes.
   Susan Willhofft, 40, of Arlington, Va., was charged with
desecrating the flag, a felony, in the first such arrest resulting
from the exhibit at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
   The arrest came as two dozen critics of the exhibit picketed the
art school and a state senator picked the flag up, removing it from
the work, for the second day in a row.
   Willhofft's attorney acknowledged that she stepped on the flag,
but said she had no criminal or political motive.
   Attorney David E. Steinberg said the charge constituted
``harassment'' by the man who filed the complaint, Homer Choate, 47,
of suburban Lockport, who opposes the work.
   ``And I would think the state's attorney's office would have
something better to do than prosecute an innocent tourist,''
Steinberg added.
   At issue is a work by art student Scott Tyler titled ``What is
the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' which is part of a minority
students' exhibit.
   The work features a montage of photographs depicting flag-draped
coffins and South Koreans burning the American flag, plus a book
that invites viewer comments.
   A U.S. flag is positioned on the floor in front of the book in
such a way that viewers are likely to step on the flag to write in
the book.
   The exhibit was closed to the public last weekend after veterans
groups complained it was illegal and disrespectful to the flag and
sued to try to force the school to remove it from the floor.
   Following a circuit judge's ruling Thursday, the show reopened.
   On Friday, state Sen. Walter Dudycz was detained briefly by
officers after he picked the flag up from the floor.
   He did it again on Saturday, and asked the Cook County State's
Attorney's office to decide whether the exhibit violates laws
against desecrating the flag. The flag was put back in the exhibit.
   Willhofft, who teaches grades 6-8, was attending a conference of
the National Association of Independent Schools, said another of her
attorneys, Lawrence S. Schaner.
   ``She had a free day, she was going to have lunch, she was going
to shop at Marshall Field,'' Schaner said. ``She had no intention of
making a political protest. She just went to see the famous Art
Institute of Chicago.
   ``She stepped on the flag,'' he said. ``She wanted to see what
was in the book.''

<TEXT>
   The fractious Greens Party on
Saturday elected a slate of new leaders to replace radicals ousted
from power last year, and one of its most famous radicals announced
she is quitting the party.
   The Greens, who have been trying to heal ideological rifts among
opposing factions, elected three new top leaders who represent a
broad section of party interests.
   The 39,000-member party sprang from radical environmentalist and
leftist peace movements in the 1970s.
   The last party leadership was dominated by radicals including
Jutta Ditfurth, who stunned the party congress in Duisburg by
announcing before the vote she plans to quit the party. She bitterly
denounced moderates who want to put the Greens on a new political
course.
   Ms. Ditfurth charged the party was practicing ``policies of
exclusion against the left'' and was ``adapting a traditional
political structure.''
   The Greens' new leaders are Ruth Hammerbacher, from the party's
moderate ``realos'' (realists) faction; Verena Krieger, who
represents interests further to the left; and Ralf Fuecks, whose
views fall between those of his two colleagues. None of the former
leaders ran for re-election.
   Ms. Ditfurth is head of the ``fundis'' (fundamentalists), who are
locked in a bitter ideological struggle with the ``realos.''
   The dispute centers on the pragmatists' willingness to work
within established political procedures and the fundamentalists'
insistence that the party steer clear of wooing the mainstream
parties.
   In her speech, Ms. Ditfurth said the party had been compromising
too many of its principles.
   ``The goal of this is apparently the formation of a government
with the Social Democrats,'' Ms. Ditfurth said.
   The Social Democrats are West Germany's main opposition party,
and will be going up against Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats in next year's federal elections.
   Polls indicate the Christian Democrats have lost support over the
last few months, opening the possibility the party might not be able
to put together a parliamentary majority after federal elections.
   Ms. Ditfurth said she will probably leave the Greens following
the 1990 elections.
   She also denounced the Alternative List (AL), the Greens' West
Berlin sister party, for its plans to join a coalition government in
that city, saying it had abandoned principles it had shared with the
Greens for years.
   The Christian Democrats were ousted from power in West Berlin
elections last month, and the victorious Social Democrats are now
negotiating with the Alternative List about forming a new government.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Americans Want Senate to Reject Tower Confirmation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Americans believe the Senate should
reject the nomination of John Tower as defense secretary, according
to a poll published in Sunday editions of the Los Angeles Times.
   The nationwide telephone poll of 1,046 adults, conducted as the
Senate debate on Tower began last week, also shows that most people
dismiss the argument that a president should be able to appoint
anybody he chooses to a Cabinet post.
   The poll, which was done Wednesday and Thursday, found that 44
percent of those interviewed believe that Tower should be rejected
by the Senate, while 35 percent believe he should be confirmed. The
remaining 21 percent were unsure.
   The poll also found that 82 percent of those surveyed rejected
assertions by the Bush administration and Republican leaders that
``the President should be given a free hand to pick whoever he
chooses for his cabinet.''
   The poll indicates that people are less concerned about Tower's
alleged heavy drinking and womanizing than about his impartiality in
dealing with defense contractors because of his prior work as a
defense consultant.
   However, 64 percent of those surveyed said they did not believe
Tower would abide by his pledge to forsake all liquor during the
duration of his service as Secretary of Defense.
   The poll showed that President George Bush continued to enjoy a
relatively high job rating, 59 percent approval to 13 percent
disapproval.
   While 61 percent said that Bush's nomination of Tower had not
influenced their overall impression of the President, 29 percent
said that the appointment had caused their opinions of Bush to fall.
   The poll found that 44 percent disapproved of the Tower
nomination and 38 percent weren't sure, while just 18 percent
approved of President Bush's nomination.
   The Times Poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, had a margin of error of
4 percentage points in either direction.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower has
moved out front in the Bush administration effort to salvage his
nomination, pleading the case publicly and setting the stage for a
possible last-ditch stand on the Senate floor.
   A White House official insisted Saturday the effort is not a lost
cause.
   ``We've still got some good prospects,'' among Democrats who
would be needed to provide a majority vote in Tower's favor, said
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``We could still pull it out,'' the official said. ``I admit it's
very tough.''
   Tower, in comments published in Sunday editions of The Washington
Post, said the Senate would be ``damning the president's judgment''
if it rejects his nomination and said he will not withdraw unless
requested to do so by the president.
   ``The important thing is a majority of the Senate is going to
subordinate the president's judgment to its own in the selection of
people that the president feels he can rely on,'' Tower said in the
interview with a small group of reporters.
   Tower, who has pledged to abstain from alcoholic beverages if he
becomes defense secretary, reiterated his contention that he does
not have a drinking problem but said he has not stopped drinking
entirely.
   ``I still have a glass of wine in the evening with dinner,
although it's not on a daily basis,'' he said.
   As the number of Democrats on record against the nomination grew,
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole raised the prospect of bringing
Tower to the Senate floor to answer allegations against him.
   ``The request would be that John Tower be allowed to come to this
chamber, to stand in this well, and to answer his critics
face-to-face, charge-by-charge, rumor-by-rumor and fact-by-fact,''
the Kansas Republican said Friday.
   Dole did not formally ask permission for Tower, once a senator
himself, to speak from the floor, but said he was considering
introducing such a motion.
   ``If we owe Senator Tower anything, we owe him the right to say,
`I've had my day in court,''' Dole said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said he would be ``happy
to consider any request'' by the minority leader, but gave no
indication on how the proposal would fare.
   If Tower came to the floor to answer questions, it would be the
first such instance for a Cabinet nominee and only the sixth time in
Senate history for a non-member to be questioned.
   On three occasions in the 1800s, newspaper reporters were called
before the Senate to answer questions about where they obtained
leaked information from closed Senate proceedings which appeared in
their stories.
   In 1933, the Senate sergeant at arms was called before the
chamber to answer questions about an article he had published
alleging that senators were selling their votes. And in 1934, three
airline officials were called to answer questions about government
contracting with airmail carriers.
   In the meantime, Tower planned to appear on a major network
interview show, CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.'' The national
television appearance follows a week in which the embattled nominee
pledged to abstain from alcohol if confirmed and lashed out at the
double-standard that existed in the Senate _ all attempts to help
his faltering cause.
   The need for last-ditch efforts came in the wake of President
Bush's inability to convince a single Democrat to support the
nominee. The administration conducted two days of intensive lobbying
with the president holding one-on-one Oval Office sessions with
swing Democrats and Vice President Dan Quayle courting senators on
Capitol Hill.
   Quayle, on a weekend ski trip to New Hampshire, said Saturday
that once Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
came out against the nomination, ``we knew that it would be an
uphill battle.''
   ``This nomination hinges really on one individual in the Senate
and that is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,''
Quayle said. ``Once he decided to go against the president we knew
that it was going to be difficult.''
   The numbers against the nomination continued to rise on Friday.
Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said the nation ``cannot take a
chance'' with Tower.
   DeConcini, who met privately at the White House with Bush earlier
this week and had hinted he might support the nominee, said Tower
``is not the proper person for this sensitive position in these
critical times.''
   An Associated Press survey of senators showed 47 Democrats and
Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., either solidly against the nomination
or leaning against, and 40 Republicans either solidly committed or
leaning toward confirmation. The Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in
the Senate.
   On Friday, Republican senators Phil Gramm of Texas and Trent Lott
of Mississippi huddled on the Senate floor over a major
administration concern _ Pressler.
   Among the other senators Republicans hope to convince is
conservative Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
   Jim Kennedy, an aide to Lieberman, said the senator planned to
``take the weekend to get away from the Washington distraction and
give it serious consideration in private.''

   A federal judge reserved judgment Saturday on
whether to block sympathy strikes by railroad workers ready to honor
Eastern Airlines machinists' picket lines, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority said.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson told lawyers for the New
York area commuter rail lines and the striking machinists at 9:30
p.m. that he would not make a decision Saturday, said MTA spokesman
John Cunningham.
   ``The judge advised the lawyers to be prepared to come back
tomorrow sometime after 10 a.m. to possibly answer further
questions,'' he said.
   Cunningham said it was unclear if the lawyers would be summoned
to meet with Patterson on Sunday, but said MTA lawyers were prepared
to meet with him.
   The MTA, parent company of the Long Island Rail Road and the
Metro-North Commuter Railroad, joined by New Jersey Transit, asked
Patterson earlier Saturday to issue a temporary restraining order
against the threatened sympathy strike, Cunningham said.
   Union mechanics and baggage handlers on strike against Eastern
Airlines have said they plan to mount secondary picket lines at
commuter railroads on Monday morning, particularly in the Northeast.
   In Philadelphia, officials of the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority have already obtained a court order aimed
at preventing a sympathy strike. SEPTA officials said the authority
hoped its court order, issued Friday night, would keep railroad
union workers on the job even if the Machinists Union sets up
pickets Monday.
   According to the complaint filed Friday, SEPTA maintained that
under their contract, its nine railroad unions and their 1,000
members can honor picket lines set up by other unions only if those
unions have contracts with SEPTA.
   In Boston, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said it
was taking steps to assign extra buses Monday morning to help move
commuters in case of a strike. Amtrak, which operates the rail
system on behalf of the MBTA, had no immediate plans to seek a court
order to stop the expected walkout, a spokeswoman in Washington
said. About 25,000 people travel by MBTA commuter railways on a
typical workday.
   In their request for an injunction, the New York area transit
systems made an argument similar to SEPTA's, saying the employees
are ``contractually obligated to work and thus must cross any picket
line established by the International Association of Machinists,''
said Simon Gourdine, director of labor relations at the MTA.
   Union leaders at the metropolitan-area rail lines had said they
would honor the picket lines and bring to a halt the trains that
carry some 320,000 commuters into Manhattan each weekday.
   Ed Yule, general chairman of the United Transportation Union for
the LIRR, the nation's largest commuter railroad, said he could not
immediately say how he would advise his workers if Patterson issued
a restraining order.
   ``It's a union leader's dilemma,'' he said.
   Should the strike go on, MTA chairman Robert Kiley predicted
``absolute chaos,'' even though officials made plans for such things
as extra buses and traffic control people to try to handle the crush
of commuters.
   No transit job actions were reported Saturday.
   The LIRR has about 135,000 daily riders, Metro-North carries
95,000 people from the northern suburbs and NJ Transit carries about
90,000. The Port Authority-Transit Hudson line, or PATH, which
carries commuters from northern New Jersey into New York City, did
not take part in the request for the injunction, officials said.

   About 500 protesters jeered at up to 100
neo-Nazi skinheads attending a white supremacist rally that had been
billed as an ``Aryan Woodstock,'' and some demonstrators scuffled
with a Ku Klux Klansman.
   About 200 police, some in riot gear, kept the demonstrators in a
soggy field about a mile from the whites-only gathering in Napa
County about 40 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   As a cold rain fell, protesters yelled ``Nazis go home!'' and
other taunts, and wielded placards with such messages as ``My Family
Died Because of Facism.''
   The protesters became enraged when a man who identified himself
as Bill Albers of the Modesto chapter of the Klan tried to walk
through the crowd. Albers and some of the demonstrators scuffled.
Gravel and sticks flew until law enforcement officers using
nightsticks brought the crowd under control.
   No arrests or injuries were reported earlier, but William
Herrell, 88, of San Jose, was slightly injured earlier when he was
dragged across a barbed-wire fence by demonstrators when he tried
unsuccessfully to enter the rally.
   Asked about the skinheads, Herrell said, ``I think they're
wonderful people.''
   ``I don't want to destroy other races. I just want to keep them
separate,'' Bob Spittler, a member of the Aryan National Socialists,
said as the rally began Friday night.
   Among the protesters Saturday was Irv Rubin of Los Angeles,
national chairman of the Jewish Defense League.
   ``People of good will cannot ignore this,'' Rubin said. ``No
matter how small their number, there has to be a statement against
their ideology. This is a battle of humanity versus the forces of
evil ... if we don't expose it, it's kind of like letting a cancer
grow on the body politic.''
   Organizer Tom Metzger, a former Klan leader who heads a group
called White Aryan Resistance, had estimated that 2,000 people would
attend, but law enforcement officials estimated attendance at 30 to
100.
   Associated Press photographer Pete Leabo, who flew over the rally
site in a helicopter, said he saw about 20 skinheads, many of them
under a tarp.
   Nazi flags decorated the rally, Leabo said.
   The event was initially billed as an ``Aryan Woodstock'' because
organizers had hoped to present performances by the skinhead bands
Midtown Boot Boys from Oklahoma, the Hammerheads from Wisconsin and
Hakenkreuz from Detroit.
   However, Napa County Superior Judge W. Scott Snowden ruled that a
permit was needed for the musical portion of the event. Snowden
rejected the county's argument that the assembly would be a public
nuisance.
   Metzger, who had argued a permit was not needed because the
concert was to be held on private property and admission was by
invitation only, decided to go ahead with the political portion of
the rally.
   Officials closed nearby state Highway 12 at Interstate 80 in
Fairfield and a road near Highway 29 to head off trouble.
   The scene was tense, as demonstrators leaned over barbed-wire
fences, screaming at a handful of skinheads watching them from atop
a nearby hill. At one point, about six skinheads who tried to get
into the rally got caught between police lines and protesters
yelling insults.
   The white power rally was held on land owned by Dr. Howard C.
Lonsdale of nearby Vallejo. Lonsdale fled Nazi Germany in 1937 with
his Jewish family when he was 4 years old, family friend Leo Coon
told The Sacramento Bee.
   Lonsdale, a prominent 55-year-old specialist, had been told the
gathering was to be an environmental rally but did not back out when
he learned its true nature because he feared reprisals, said Coon,
acting as Lonsdale's spokesman.
   ``Would you like your house pushed over the hill? That's why he
hasn't spoken out against them,'' said Coon.
   ``He was told by the group that if he canceled out of this lease,
they'd sue ... him, they'd ruin his practice,'' Coon added.

   A naval supply clerk and a naval storekeeper
were arrested on charges of espionage and stealing $150,000 worth of
classified military parts and electronic components, the Navy said
Saturday.
   Donald Wayne King and Ronald Dean Graf, both 23 and assigned to
Naval Air Station New Orleans, were arrested Friday, said Senior
Chief Gerald Black, the base's spokesman.
   ``Classified military aircraft parts containing sensitive
technology and U.S. Navy electronics, (and) aircraft components
valued at more than $150,000 were recovered during the arrests,''
Black said in a statement.
   Graf, an airman aviation storekeeper, and King, an airman
apprentice aviation storekeeper, will be held in the Navy brig at
Pensacola, Fla., until their courts-martial, Black said.
   The two men were charged with espionage, theft of government
property, sale of sensitive and classified aircraft parts and
selling cocaine.
   Wayne Clookie, head of the Naval Investigative Service office in
New Orleans, said he didn't know what the motive was in the case.
   The investigation began Jan. 30, when someone who was offered
information and aircraft parts alerted the Naval Investigative
Service, Clookie said.
   He said an undercover agent posing as a buyer from a foreign
government got in touch with King and Graf. Clookie wouldn't say
which government.
   The two men _ whose jobs gave them access to parts, manuals and
other information _ sold about 30 items to the agent, said Clookie.
   King and Graf offered to steal and sell classified information,
aircraft parts, technical manuals, schematic drawings of weapons
systems and communication information, but didn't follow through on
everything, he said.
   ``Some money did change hands'' during the investigation, Clookie
said, but he refused to say how much on the grounds that the
information might jeopardize the prosecution.
   Clookie said there was no indication anyone else was involved.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police stopped nine buses carrying
about 100 American children for about three hours Friday because the
vehicles did not have proper license plates.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, the U.S. military
headquarters for Latin America, said the action was ``arbitrary .. .
part of a campaign ... to restrict the movement of U.S. forces in
Panama.''
   All the buses had ``U.S. Navy'' painted on their sides, which
allows them to travel in the Panama City, said the spokesman, who
would not let his name be used.
   The buses were carrying children of U.S. Southern Command
employees in Panama.
   Police are part of the Panama Defense Forces led by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noreiga, the country's de facto ruler, who has been indicted
in the United States for drug trafficking and laundering money.
Washington has imposed economic sanctions in an effort to remove him.
   Lt. Col. Aquilino Sieiro, a spokesman for the Panamanian
military, said in a telephone interview the buses did not have the
right license plates, but refused to explain. He also said, without
elaboration, that ``the incident is part of a disinformation
campaign and another provocation.''
   Along with the headquarters operation, the United States has
about 10,000 military personnel in Panama to defend the Panama Canal.

   The government said Friday that Burma's
ruling military junta will ``return to the barracks'' next year
after handing over power to an elected parliament.
   The military has held sway in this Southeast Asian nation for 27
years.
   At a weekly news conference, government spokesman Kyaw Sann
denied rumors that the military would participate in general
elections next year or that individual officers would resign
commissions to take part.
   ``They (the military) will hand over power to the new parliament
and return to the barracks,'' he said.
   Kyaw Sann also warned Burma's newly formed political parties to
avoid links with foreign diplomatic missions in Rangoon.
   He said some parties were closely linked with such missions, but
gave no details.
   Under a proposed election law announced on Wednesday, government
employees, including military personnel and police, cannot run for
election. The proposal is being reviewed by Burma's 233 political
parties and the general public.
   In September, Gen. Saw Maung and a group of military officers
crushed pro-democracy demonstrations here. The general, now head of
a military government, promised general elections in early 1990 and
the end of one-party rule.
   At another news conference, Finance and Trade Minister Col. Abel
announced Friday that as of April 1, government workers' salaries
will be raised anywhere from 20 percent to 109 percent and the
minimum wage will be nearly doubled.
   Salaries of armed forces personnel will be raised on a sliding
scale at rates similar to those of the civil servants. There are
about 1.2 million government employes, including members of the
armed forces.
   Abel said increased tax collections and greater production at
state enterprises would offset any inflationary effects.
   Civil servants have long complained about low wages and rising
prices. Many joined anti-government demonstrations last year.
   Salaries now range from $34 to $258 a month.
   The minimum daily wage of $1.33 will be raised to $2.34. Pensions
of retired government workers will also be increased.
   In another development, Thai border patrol police at Tak,
Thailand, said Karen guerrillas kept up attacks on the Burmese
village of Myawaddy on Friday, firing mortar rounds that killed
three villagers and wounded nine.
   Police Lt. Col. Manit Subsai-on said Burmese troops replied with
artillery and mortar fire.
   According to Thai military intelligence reports, the Karens have
been attacking the village, just inside the Burmese border, in
retaliation for an army offensive on a Karen stronghold 38 miles
away.
   The Karens for four decades have been fighting for greater
autonomy.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish group met with Gen. Andres
Rodriguez on Friday and said the military ruler promised to find two
Nazi war criminals believed living in this country.
   Rabbi Martin M. Rosenthal, director of B'nai B'rith
Anti-Defamation League's department of Latin American Affairs, said
Rodriguez pledged to ``investigate, locate, detain and expel'' the
two war criminals.
   He said he would not identify the men for fear they would be
alerted to the search and flee to avoid capture.
   ``He reiterated that Paraguay will not be a ship for pirates or a
cave for thieves, and said they would rid the country of garbage
such as Nazi war criminals,'' Rosenthal said after a 25-minute
meeting with Rodriguez.
   Rodriguez, who seized power in the Feb. 3 coup that unseated
president Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, made no public comment following
the meeting.
   Rosenthal noted that Rodriguez' pledge of assistance contrasted
sharply with the cold reception given to such requests by the
Stroessner regime. In 1984, the newspaper of the ruling Colorado
Party mocked the efforts of Nazi hunter Beate Klarsfeld to locate
Josef Mengele.
   Under the 1976-83 military government in Argentina, requests for
information or arrest of alleged Nazi war criminals were ignored,
but since civilian President Raul Alfonsin took office, three have
been arrested, Rosenthal said.
   Also Friday, opposition leader Domingo Laino said his party may
participate in May 1 national elections even if some of its
electoral demands are denied. Laino, after meeting Rodriguez, told
reporters that ``the response to some of the terms of this package
can be positive and others negative and that does not mean we will
refuse to participate.
   ``We know we cannot reach the perfection of democracy overnight,
but we do want some reasonable conditions under which we can
participate,'' he said. ``We only want these elections to be an
improvement over the past.''
   During the nearly 35-year military Stroessner dictatorship,
several opposition parties refused to participate in elections,
claiming they were fraudulent.
   The National Accord alliance of three opposition parties has
asked Rodriguez to delay elections until at least Sept. 1 to give
them time to register supporters and organize campaigns. They also
hope to eliminate a statute that allots two-thirds of the seats in
congress to the party that wins a majority of votes.
   The Colorado Party, in power since 1947, is widely expected to
dominate the elections. Rodriguez is the party's presidential
candidate.

   A Protestant extremist was
convicted on Friday of killing six people, including three shot at
an IRA funeral, and was sentenced to life with the recommendation
that he serve at least 30 years.
   Michael Stone, 33, raised a clenched fist and shouted ``Long live
Ulster! No surrender!'' as he was led away at Belfast Crown Court.
   Judge Eoin Higgins said the people of Northern Ireland had a
right to long protection from such a ``dangerous and ruthless
criminal.''
   Police moved in to separate Roman Catholic and Protestant
spectators who jeered at each other as Stone was taken away.
   Stone called himself a ``free-lance'' killer for outlawed
sectarian organizations, but denied membership in groups that attack
the British province's Catholic minority.
   He told police he went to the funeral to kill Irish Republican
Army political leaders he knew would attend the burial in March 1988
of three IRA members killed by British commandos in Gibraltar.
   The IRA has waged a 20-year guerrilla war to drive the British
from Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province
with the Irish Republic, which is overwhelmingly Catholic.
   Stone followed mourners from St. Agnes Catholic Church in Belfast
to the Milltown Cemetery and got past IRA security men by saying
their slogan in Gaelic: ``Our day will come.''
   As the funeral began, he lobbed grenades into the crowd and
opened fire with two guns.
   He said there were too many children and he could not shoot at
his intended targets from Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing:
Gerry Adams, the president; vice president Martin McGuinness, and
senior party official Danny Morrison.
   At one point, he told police, he gave a little girl a coin to
move away from him.
   The crowd pursued as Stone ran between tombstones shooting,
caught him and beat him until police took him away.
   Prosecutor Ronnie Appleton said when the trial opened Feb. 20
that, when police told him he had killed at least two people, Stone
replied: ``Brilliant. I am game for anything.''
   Stone also was convicted of killing Paddy Brady, a milkman, in
Belfast; Dermot Hackett, a bread deliver, near Omagh, and workman
Kevin McPolin at Lisburn.

   Frank H. Dunkle, director of the Fish and
Wildlife Service, has submitted his resignation to Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan, a spokesman for the agency said Friday.
   The spokesman, Mike Smith, said he didn't know why Dunkle
resigned or what his future plans are. Interior sources, declining
to be identified, have said Dunkle made no secret that he would have
liked to remain at his current post in the new administration.
   Smith said Dunkle informed regional directors of the agency
Friday that he planned to leave his post as director of the Fish and
Wildlife Service March 15.
   On several occasions, Lujan has said he plans to replace key
bureau directors at the Interior Department as part of the normal
transition from one administration to another.
   But Dunkle also has been the center of some controversy.
   Allegations surfaced last month that Dunkle had interceded on the
behalf of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Tex., after it was learned that Gramm's
property on Maryland's Eastern Shore was under surveillance by Fish
Wildlife Service officials.
   The officials suspected that birds were being baited for hunting
on the property, a practice that violates hunting laws.
   Dunkle denied that he had acted improperly. He said Gramm only
was told that bait had been spotted by routine aerial surveillance
on water near Gramm's property and that Fish and Wildlife officials
notified the senator to either not hunt or clean it up.
   Dunkle has maintained that such advisories are routine.
   Gramm has said that he does not use the property for hunting, but
that he does feed ducks occasionally. Dunkle at the time said Gramm
asked him to keep him advised if people broke the law on his
property.

   Charles Lewis, one of the central figures in a
pair of federal investigation of Mayor Marion Barry, was arrested in
the Virgin Islands on Friday for allegedly selling cocaine to
undercover FBI agents, the FBI announced.
   Lewis allegedly sold six to seven grams of the drug to the agents
on St. Thomas and he has been charged with two counts of
distributing cocacine, according to W. Douglas Gow, an FBI spokesman.
   Lewis will be arraigned on the Caribbean island, the FBI
officials said.
   Lewis, 48, is a central figure in the investigations of Barry.
The two men are friends.
   After Lewis' arrest, Barry's office issued a statement saying
Barry was surprised.
   ``To my knowledge he (Charles Lewis) has never been arrested or
involved with any illegal activities,'' Barry said. ``I would be
shocked if these allegations about him turn out to be true.''
   Barry said he was also aware that Lewis' arrest would also
``raise the specter that something illegal happened'' when Barry
visited Lewis at a downtown hotel Dec. 22. ``I want to repeat again
that I never saw any drugs or drug paraphernalia during my visits
with Lewis.''
   Lewis was the target of a police investigation in December when a
maid at the Washington hotel alleged that he offered her drugs in
exchange for sex. Two district police officers were at the hotel
attempting to buy drugs from Lewis, but the drug buy was called off
when the officers realized that Barry was visiting Lewis.
   A federal grand jury is now looking at the circumstances
surrounding Barry's visit to the hotel.
   A second investigation involving both Lewis and Barry focuses on
the city's joint personnel project with the Virgin Islands.
   Lewis was in the charge of the project, but was fired last April
when officials in St. Thomas became concerned about cost overruns.
Barry and other top district officials ran up hotel and restaurant
bills of more than $37,000 in connection with the project.

<TEXT>
   Two men in custody Friday in the
1981 kidnapping and killing of an 11-year-old girl, were linked to
the crime by a third man who confessed in a letter mailed after his
death, police said.
   Christine Anderson was last seen getting into a car on Aug. 31,
1981. Her disappearance set off a widespread search in the Fort
Lauderdale area, but no trace of her was found until her body was
found in a field six months later.
   Police had been unable to come up with any clues in the case
since then.
   On Dec. 16, a man named Frank Maxwell died in an automobile
accident in Texas, and his brother complied with his request to mail
a sealed letter to Fort Lauderdale police.
   The letter confessed to Maxwell's involvement in Christine's
disappearance and death, and linked two other men to the case,
police said.
   ``I would imagine throughout the years (Maxwell's) conscience was
bothering him,'' said Sgt. Tom Carney, of the Broward County
Sheriff's homicide unit.
   Gilbert Anthony Hall, 26, of Oakland Park, was arrested on Monday
and is being held in the Broward County Jail. Anthony Rodriguez, 29,
was arrested on Thursday in Kinnelon, N.J., police said. They were
charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder.
   ``There was no inkling at all that these people had anything to
do with'' Christine's death, said Fort Lauderdale police spokesman
Ott Cefkin.
   Maxwell's letter said Hall picked up Christine and took her to
his mobile home, where she was sedated and apparently raped numerous
times, according to a court document.
   Questioned by detectives, Hall admitted to picking up the girl,
taking her to the trailer where he lived with Maxwell and Rodriguez
to have sex with her, but said Rodriguez and Maxwell killed her,
sheriff's spokesman Al Gordon said.
   Hall said that he gave Christine several drinks and that Maxwell
gave her pills, the arrest warrant says. The letter said the girl
was suffocated and her body was dumped.
   The letter was given to police in January but they would not
release its contents on Thursday.
   Christine's mother, Karen Green, said she has continued to think
about her daughter, but tried to live a normal life.
   ``I wondered, always about the details and how many people'' were
involved, she said. ``I think knowing will help a little bit. It
will help to know that two others (the suspects) will be sweating it
out.''

   John Tower's Senate allies, struggling to gain
the offensive in a tense confirmation battle, are suggesting that
the defense secretary-designate come to the Senate floor and respond
``charge by charge'' to the allegations against him.
   ``If we owe Senator Tower anything, we owe him the right to say,
`I've had my day in court,''' Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole said
Friday as Tower's confirmation chances dimmed further with two
additional Democrats joining the opposition.
   Dole stopped short of turning his suggestion into a formal
proposal, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said
he would be ``happy to consider any request.'' Mitchell also said he
was troubled by the confirmation proceedings, in which material from
a confidential FBI report that is damaging to Tower has been leaked
in the news media but may not be discussed openly on the Senate

   McFarlane, placed on two-years' probation Friday for misleading
Congress about covert U.S. support for the Nicaraguan rebels, will
be a key prosecution witness at the trial of his former aide Oliver
L. North.
   Leaving the U.S. Courthouse with his wife, Jonda, McFarlane said
the ordeal left him with ``strong faith and a terrific wife and a
free country.''

   The United States and other Western
nations are putting together emergency loans to help Venezuela
weather an economic crisis that sparked nationwide riots and the
deaths this week of at least 300 people.
   President Carlos Andres Perez on Friday linked the bloodiest
civil unrest in Venezuela's history to the burden of its foreign
debt. He said debt payments threaten the newest democracies in Latin
America.
   He accused foreign debtors of inflexibility by demanding
repayment of the region's $420 billion foreign debt without regard
to a nation's ability to pay. Venezuela owes international banks and
lenders $33 billion _ fourth largest in Latin America after Brazil,
Mexico and Argentina.

   The United States is joining its European
allies in pushing for elimination of all ozone-depleting chemicals
by the end of the century, a sharp acceleration of the schedule for
ending their use.
   President Bush said Friday he has asked the head of the
Environmental Protection Agency to join the call to ban
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by the year 2000 at an international
conference that begins this weekend in London.
   The United States accounts for about one-third of the production
of ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily CFCs, which are widely used
as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners and as a cleaning
agent for electronic and computer equipment.

   Five nuns protesting the
liberalization of their order plan to spend a sixth month barricaded
in their monastery unless they are convinced of the legitimacy of a
Vatican directive to stop.
   The nuns have refused since Oct. 4 to leave the monastery's
infirmary until the Vatican ruled in the dispute. The nuns said they
feared their mother superior would evict them before the Vatican had
a chance to review their case.
   A spokeswoman for the nuns said Friday they didn't believe the
ruling delivered to them by Roman Catholic Bishop Frank Rodimer of
the Paterson, N.J., diocese was legitimate and that they would
continue their protest. ``Nothing came here with a Vatican seal on
it,'' said Betty Sutton, the spokeswoman. ``It's the bishop's final
trick to get them out.''

<HEAD>Investing In S&amp;L Bailout Should Be A Good Bet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors soon may be offered the chance to buy
into the Bush administration's savings and loan bailout plan, but
will the $50 billion in bonds proposed to fund the program be a wise
investment?
   ``It's a fairly secure security,'' said Carol A. Stone, a senior
economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. She said she
thinks the bonds will be attractive to investors.
   But Bruce Lakefield, an executive vice president at Shearson
Lehman Government Securities Inc., was more skeptical.
   ``I don't think enough information is out in the marketplace at
the present time to get a good feel,'' he said last week. ``We
haven't gone through Congress. We're just speculating on the way it
was presented along the way.''
   The Bush plan envisions another new government agency, the
Resolution Funding Corp., or REFCO, to be set up to float the $50
billion in 30-year bonds over three years. Proceeds from the
securities would be added to other government monies to rescue or
close ailing thrifts, which make up about a third of the nation's
3,100 S&amp;Ls.
   The principal on the bonds would be repaid through increased
insurance premiums paid by the S&amp;L industry. Most of the interest
payments on the bonds are expected to come from taxpayer money.
   It's expected that REFCO would buy zero-coupon Treasury bonds in
the open market to collateralize the $50 billion debt.
   Analysts said there's no doubt the REFCO bonds will be safe but
how attractive their yields will be remains to be seen.
   ``They're intangibles that are very difficult to quantify at this
point,'' said William Brachfeld, an executive vice president of
Daiwa Securities Inc.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told Congress last month
that he expeced the REFCO bonds to be traded at a premium of about a
quarter of a percentage point over 30-year Treasury bonds, which are
now yielding around 9.15 percent.
   But Lakefield said he expected the premium to be slightly higher,
as is the case with other agency bonds. He noted that a bond the
government issues to back military loans to Israel is about a third
of a percentage point over comparable Treasuries.
   Government agencies have been issuing bonds over the years to
finance anything from farm loans to home mortgages. Although they're
backed by the U.S. government, they are not considered direct
obligations, and that's why their yields are slightly higher than
Treasuries.
   Ms. Stone said the REFCO bonds would appeal to ``almost anybody
who is interested in a long-term investment,''such as retirees,
pension funds and life insurance companies.
   Lakefield predicted the market would easily absorb them despite
the large volume.
   ``The marketplace is a big, international marketplace,'' he said.
   Under Bush's plan, $10 billion of the bonds would be sold in
fiscal 1989, $25 billion in fiscal 1990 and $15 billion in fiscal
1991.

<HEAD>Bulls Storm Back To Copper Market</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: An ADD with weekly price trends will follow later in the cycle.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The copper bulls are at it again, buying up copper futures,
driving up prices and talking up the possibility of new record highs
in a market that is proving to be as resilient as it is volatile.
   Some of the recent developments supporting the current rally,
such as labor strife in Peru and shipping problems in Zaire, are
familiar to those who have followed copper on its mostly upward
course during the past two years.
   Other factors _ the fear of AIDS in Africa, for example _ have
not been widely cited before.
   But underpinning the gains are the same basic circumstances that
prompted copper's runup from around 65 cents a pound in the spring
of 1987 to the record high of $1.6475 a pound set last Dec. 8 on New
York's Commodity Exchange: strong demand and tight supplies.
   The supply tightness appeared to be easing earlier this year
following the settlement in mid-December of a 57-day miners' strike
in Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper producer.
   A subsequent increase in supplies of copper deliverable against
Commodity Exchange contracts contributed to a selloff that dropped
the price of spot copper on the exchange to $1.257 a pound by
Valentine's Day.
   But world demand for copper remained strong, a function of the
economic growth of industrialized nations. Then shipping
difficulties resurfaced in Zambia and Zaire, respectively the
world's fourth- and seventh-largest copper producers, sparking new
waves of speculative buying.
   The rally continued in the past week on fears of another extended
strike in Peru after miners there called for a 3-day work stoppage,
beginning March 26, to protest management's failure to comply with
the terms of the December agreement.
   Copper for spot delivery on the Commodity Exchange jumped 5.6
cents Friday amid persistent supply concerns to $1.53 a pound.
   Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said the copper market looks strong on all fronts.
   ``The consumption numbers show very strong growth, the
fundamentals look good, the technical signals look good, physical
stocks are low _ it's beginning to look like a replay of 1987 and
1988,'' he said.
   The shortage of copper was underscored by the small amount of
copper available for delivery against the Commodity Exchange
contract due to expire on March 29.
   As of the beginning of trading on Friday, exchange inventories of
deliverable copper totaled 17,446 tons. Open interest in the March
contract _ the number of contracts still to be settled by either an
offsetting trade or physical delivery _ was 9,427 contracts, the
equivalent of 117,838 tons.
   The vast majority of futures contracts are settled by offsetting
trades, not physical delivery, but analysts say the unusually wide
imbalance is one indication of extreme supply tightness.
   The United States and Canada produce nearly 30 percent of the
world's refined copper but much of the remainder comes from Third
World countries where political upheavals, labor disputes, terrorist
bombings, crumbling transportation systems and equipment
malfunctions occasionally disrupt mining and refinery operations.
   The frequency of such interruptions seems to have increased along
with the demand for and price of copper. During the past year, major
disruptions occurred in Peru, Chile, Zambia and Zaire, all major
copper producers.
   Market analyst George Anagnos of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
in New York contends African production also has been hampered by
the flight of mining engineers from the continent due to fear of
AIDS.
   The deadly disease has spread rapidly in some part of Africa.
   ``Concerns over the disease are particularly prevalent among the
Europeans, primarily Belgian engineers who have been hired to
operate the mines in Zaire,'' Anagnos wrote in a recent report.
``The decision by many of the engineers to leave the nation has
exacerbated prevailing diplomatic problems between Belgium and Zaire
(formerly a Belgian colony) and resulted in supply losses.''
   The AIDS angle may seem trivial but it doesn't take much to move
a market made nervous by supply tightness.
   ``Given the right conditions, you could see new highs,'' said
Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney Harris Upham
&amp; Co. ``A lot of things are possible in a market like this.''

<HEAD>Consumers Focus On Price, Service In `Overstored' America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For every man, woman and child in America, there
are 15 square feet of retail space in shopping centers and malls.
Count the area in neighborhood stores and the figure becomes even
bigger.
   The relentless development of new shopping sites probably will
ease as the baby-boom bulge of the U.S. population grows older, but
it still continues.
   Too many of the stores springing up are the same, lacking the
flare they'd need to stand out in an overpopulated retail landscape,
analysts say. And not enough stores that supply do-it-yourself
household gear or cater to the needs of older people are being
built, contrary to what demographic trends indicate are needed, they
note.
   Karen Sack, a retailing analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.,
says the nation's big retailers went on an expansion binge in the
1960s and '70s, boosting growth by opening more and more stores.
   ``Growth no longer works'' as a way of winning market share, says
Sack, who came up with the U.S. per capita estimate of retail space
using figures from the International Council of Shopping Centers.
   Price is the highest priority for many consumers when choosing
where to shop. Service also is important, but probably less so.
   The success of discounters that are threatening to topple Sears,
Roebuck and Co. from the head of the retail league table, such as K
Mart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., illustrates the significance
consumers attach to finding what they feel are fair prices.
   Periodic markdowns, even drastic ones, aren't a guarantee of
gaining a faithful customer following, either.
   ``Sales don't work anymore,'' Sack says. ``Nobody pays full price
for things anymore and a lot of stores have lost credibility by
announcing sales and then not having the goods available, so they
have to give rain checks.''
   Promising a ``sale that never ends,'' Sears opened its doors on a
new low-price policy this past week.
   Advertising on television, radio and in newspapers dramatized the
unprecedented shift in strategy by the retailer, which now is in its
second century of operation.
   The retailing giant shut down all of its stores across the
country for 42 hours to mobilize thousands of workers to slash price
tags on 50,000 items.
   When the more than 800 Sears, Roebuck stores across the country
reopened at noon Wednesday, customers flocked in to see for
themselves what the hoopla was about. As human nature would have it,
some were thrilled by the bargains, others weren't.
   Sears hopes to keep them coming back by pursuing an ``everyday
low prices'' policy. It has vowed to meet competitors' prices; if
customers bring in another store's advertisement with a lower price
than Sears has on an identical item, Sears will match it.
Supervisors have been ordered to shop at rival retailers to
determine what they are charging.
   It won't be clear for months whether Sears' ideas for maintaining
its pre-eminent position in the retail industry is working.
Shoppers, even more cost-conscious now that interest rates are on
the rise, will cast the deciding vote.
   ``The consumer is very smart,'' says Sack. ``They'll decide
whether they really feel if they're getting good value.''
   In other business this past week:
   _Morton Thiokol Inc., manufacturer of the solid rocket motors for
the Challenger space shuttle, which exploded after liftoff Jan. 28,
1986 killing seven astronauts, announced a major realignment. Its
thriving specialty chemicals business, including the Morton salt
business, will be spun off from its troubled aerospace operation.
   _ RJR Nabisco Inc. snuffed out its ``smokeless'' cigarette after
spending millions of dollars during almost a decade of research. The
company said it was pulling the controversial cigarette off store
shelves, ending five-month trials in test markets. The Premier brand
was condemned to death partly because smokers said it tasted
terrible.
   _A series of reports suggested the economy remains strong but
rising interest rates may be affecting consumer spending. The
Commerce Department said the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,
the government's chief gauge of future economic activity, went up a
healthy 0.6 percent in January. Another department report said
personal income gained 1.8 percent in January, while growth in
personal consumption expenditures slowed to 0.1 percent.

<HEAD>Economic Slowdown Slow In Coming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It has been a long wait for Wall Streeters
looking for signs of a much-predicted slowdown in the economy.
   The script written by most bulls on the stock market for 1989
called for business activity to cool off, allowing interest rates to
top out and turn downward.
   That, in turn, would ease the competitive pressure on the stock
market that comes from virtually riskless money-market securities
such as Treasury bills yielding close to 9 percent.
   But approaching the end of the first quarter of the year, there
is little evidence at hand that the economy is yielding to
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   On Friday, for example, the Commerce Department reported that the
index of leading economic indicators rose 0.6 percent in January
after posting a 0.7 percent increase the month before.
   If a slackening of growth is in the offing, it hasn't shown up
yet in that statistical early-warning system.
   But many adherents to the ``slowdown'' view still insist the
picture is likely to change before long.
   ``We will soon see softer economic numbers and a peaking of
rates,'' declares John Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``There is a myth that the Federal Reserve has not been tough
enough. Two years ago the prime rate was resting at 7{ percent. Now
it is 11{ percent. That's 400 basis points, or an increase of over
50 percent.
   ``There should be little doubt that a double-digit prime, coupled
with double-digit mortgage rates, will be reflected in economic
activity.''
   Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber, said the Fed stepped up
its credit-tightening in November after it concluded that growth had
been restrained to some extent, but not enough to satisfy the
central bank's inflation-fighting goals.
   ``Given lags between changes in monetary policy and the ultimate
effects on the economy, it was too soon to expect the recent crop of
January economic statistics to show very much effect from the
tightening since November,'' Harris stated.
   ``However, because tightening `worked' last year, it should do so
again.''
   Hopes on that score helped the stock market achieve some grudging
gains in the past week, recouping some of the previous week's steep
losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 28.75 to 2,274.29,
rebounding from a 79.28-point drop the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.18 to
163.90; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 4.03 to 403.99, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 4.73 at 326.22.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 155.66 million shares a day,
against 154.03 million in the preceding week.
   Some observers, of course, worry not that the Fed has been too
cautious but that it has gone too far, setting the economy on course
for a recession.
   In the view of Hugh Johnson at First Albany Corp., there are good
reasons to worry about inflation.
   ``Inflation rates are likely to strengthen, Federal Reserve
policy should remain taut, and interest rates may back up further,''
Johnson said.
   ``By midyear, the economy should begin to slow and the rate of
inflation should begin to recede.
   ``The Federal Reserve has not tightened enough to cause a
recession, although the risk that they will, over the near term,
should be taken seriously.''

<HEAD>Big Thrift Enters Regulatory Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gibraltar Financial Corp., one of
the nation's 10 biggest savings and loan companies, revealed Friday
it had agreed with federal regulators to restrict its activities in
hopes of stemming continued losses.
   The company also said it would require a substantial investment
from outside or a merger to maintain federally required capital
levels.
   The company, parent of the 86-branch Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan,
with assets of $15 billion, has been losing money since late 1987,
and recently disclosed it expected 1988 losses to reach $71 million
to $76 million.
   Additionally, profit in the first quarter of 1989 will be cut by
a $20 million writeoff from the closing of Gibraltar MoneyCenter,
which makes loans out of state, the company said in a news release.
That closure is part of the supervisory agreement with the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the company said.
   The supervisory agreement had been expected since January, when
the company revealed that federal regulators had declared Gibraltar
to be in ``unsafe and unsound'' condition. That finding was made
despite the fact Gibraltar met federal capital requirements, which
govern how much cash the company must have available to back its
loans.
   The agreement with regulators restricts Gibraltar to making home
loans in California, Florida and Washington state, the company said.
A previous agreement to restrict growth remains in effect.
   ``It is evident we will be unable to maintain required capital
levels without a merger with or major investment by a third party,''
James Thayer, Gibraltar chairman, president and chief executive
officer, said in a news release. ``Any such transaction will require
significant FSLIC assistance ... There is no assurance that we will
be successful in these efforts.''
   Gibraltar started on its slide with losses on real estate loans.
Recently, it has been hurt by rising interest rates, which force it
to pay more to attract deposits than it earns in interest on
fixed-rate loans it made in the past.

   The government released more data pointing to continued strength
in the economy, with reports that its key economic forecasting gauge
rose sharply in January and that factory orders were strong that
month except for a fallback in transportation equipment.
   But neither report, released on Friday, had a major effect on the
financial markets.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.58
to 2,274.29. Bond prices were narrowly mixed, while the dollar
declined against most major currencies.
   Meanwhile, the nation's Big Three automakers reported Friday that
car and truck sales fell 17.9 percent in February compared with the
same period last year.
   U.S.-made cars sold by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. sold at an average daily rate of 26,062 during the
period this year. That compares with an average of 32,297 cars sold
daily during the same period last year. Sales of light trucks
averaged 15,561 a day in late February, compared with a daily rate
of 18,419 during the same time last year.
   January's 0.6 percent rise in the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators followed a 0.7 percent increase in December and provided
fresh evidence that 1989 opened on a strong note despite widespread
expectations of an impending slowdown.
   The index, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine
months into the future, was up and down during much of last year.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
January's rise in the index ``shows a moderate level of growth which
we believe is conducive to a healthy economy.''
   However, analysts cautioned that the latest signs of robust
economic activity could heighten concerns that the economy is
speeding ahead too quickly to contain inflationary pressures. That,
they said, could increase the risk of a recession by causing the
Federal Reserve to act too aggressively as it pushes up interest
rates to slow the economy and restrain inflation.
   ``I think there is a risk that we'll overreact to the data and
push ourselves into a recession in the latter part of this year or
in 1990,'' said economist John Hagens of the Wefa Group, a
forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   A second report Friday from the Commerce Department offered
additional evidence of strength in the economy.
   Although orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods were
down 1.3 percent in January, the decrease was attributed to a
fallback in demand for transportation equipment from record levels
set in December.
   Excluding transportation, factory orders were up 0.2 percent
during January. And orders in the key category of non-defense
capital goods, considered a good barometer of industry investment
plans, were up 1.6 percent in January.
