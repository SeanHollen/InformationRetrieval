   Angola said its troops killed 40 South
African soldiers who crossed the border, violating a regional peace
agreement, the Angolan news agency ANGOP reported Sunday.
   The Marxist government protested to South Africa about the
incident that also left seven Angolan soldiers dead, said the report
monitored in Lisbon.
   The Pretoria government rejected the charge and requested an
immediate meeting of a commission monitoring the peace accord to
discuss the matter.
   The Angolan Defense Ministry statement issued Saturday said South
African troops on Wednesday crossed into Angola from neighboring
Namibia in support of Angolan rebels, ANGOP reported.
   The Angolan government troops drove the South Africans back to
the Namibian frontier after heavy fighting that ended early Friday,
ANGOP reported. It said 40 South African soldiers were
   In Pretoria, the South African Foreign Affairs Department said it
replied ``in the strongest terms'' to the allegations contained in a
protest note sent by Angola's government.
   In the statement Sunday, South Africa said it was on standby to
attend an urgent meeting of the monitoring commission in Luanda, the
Angolan capital, to discuss Angola's allegations.
   The U.S. State Department said last week it had no evidence that
any South African troops entered Angola.
   South African military authorities say their forces are strictly
observing the U.S.-brokered peace agreement signed in December. The
agreement bars South African military aid to the anti-Marxist rebels
in Angola and calls for independence of Namibia from South African
control.
   The peace accord established a joint commission, comprised of
South African, Cuban and Angolan representatives, to monitor
observance of the various provisions.
   As part of the peace agreement, about 50,000 Cuban troops were to
withdraw from Angola, where they have been helping the government
fight the rebels belonging to the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
   The rebel group rejects the peace accords and has vowed to
continue fighting until the Angolan government agrees to share power.
   The area where the fighting reportedly took place is near a
stretch of the border between Angola and Namibia which does not have
monitoring posts called for in the peace agreement.
   The rebels said Saturday that 275 government soldiers died in
heavy fighting last week when 4,000 guerrillas clashed with the
Angolan army in southern Cuando Cubango province.
   The rebels denied South African troops participated in the
fighting.

   Police officers from states where Ted Bundy killed
or may have killed will meet next week at the FBI's Behavioral
Science Laboratory in Quantico, Va.
   Bundy died in the electric chair in Starke, Fla., on Jan. 24 for
the 1978 murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach of Lake City, Fla.
   One of the key figures expected at the week-long gathering is
Bill Hagmeier, an FBI agent who interviewed Bundy extensively and
sat in on many of the interviews Bundy gave in the week before he
died.
   The number of known Bundy victims is between 23 and 30, based on
the confessions he gave in the days before his death. Some law
enforcment officials believed he committed many more murders than
those he confessed to.
   States in which Bundy confessed to killings include Washington,
Utah, Colorado and Florida, but other states with unsolved killings
have also expressed interest in the former law school student.

<HEAD>Walesa Adviser Warns Followers Against Wildcat Strikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An adviser to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
warned Sunday that the banned union would be blamed for wildcat
strikes and called on supporters to show discipline and reject such
actions.
   At a church frequented by Walesa, the Rev. Henryk Jankowski, an
adviser to the Solidarity chief, suggested the strikes were
provocations at a time when the union is trying to win status during
its crucial talks with the government. The talks began Feb. 6.
   A strike at a steel mill in southern Poland has not received
support from Solidarity or the government-sanctioned OPZZ trade
union alliance.
   ``No one will claim responsibility for the currently organized
strikes, not the OPZZ, not the left and not the right,'' Jankowski
said. ``So again, Solidarity will be blamed.
   ``I understand that at this moment the life of the Polish family
is very difficult. Today all the more so we are obliged to show a
certain discipline,'' he said.
   Walesa did not attend the Mass at St. Brygida's Church where
Jankowski spoke and he did not authorize the statement, Walesa and
church officials said later.
   After the Mass, attended by 4,000 people, about 500 people staged
a protest march to the train station.
   Demonstrators chanted ``Solidarity'' and ``Down with Communism''
and some threw stones at riot police shepherding the march toward
the station. Police blocked the marchers and at one point charged
them but did not use their riot truncheons.
   A strike at the Laziska steel mill in southern Poland that began
Friday over wages also continued, the state-run news agency PAP
said. A Solidarity spokeswoman said workers at the mill said their
action was spontaneous and not led by any union.
   The state PAP news service Sunday reported the end of a three-day
strike led by the OPZZ at two departments of the Marceli Nowotko
steel plant in Ostrowiec Swietkrzyzskia in central Poland.
   Workers who had opposed the distribution of the plant's pay
agreed to continue with the present pay system until May 15, when
wages will be reevaluated, PAP said.
   A strike over pay by transport workers in Piotrkow Trybunalski, a
central Polish provincial city of 80,000 people, continued. The
strike began Friday and is backed by the official trade union OPZZ.

   Charles Lawrence Bolte, a four-star
general who was the Army's vice chief of staff during the mid-1950s,
died Saturday. He was 93.
   Bolte, who retired from active duty in 1955, was a company
commander in World War I. As a major general in World War II, he
commanded the 34th Infantry Division in Italy.
   After the war he served as Army Ground Forces chief of staff and
chairman of the Inter-American Defense Board. He was the Army
commander in chief in Europe in 1952 and 1953.
   He served as Army vice chief of staff, the number-two position in
the service, from October 1953 until his retirement in April 1955.
   His decorations included two Distinguished Service Medals, the
Silver Star, the Legion of Merit and the Purple Heart.

   About 30,000 Italian and Arab demonstrators waving
banners and chanting slogans marched Saturday to support creation of
a Palestinian state, Italian news agencies said.
   The agencies said the march, organized by the Italian League for
People's Rights and the Association for Peace, was led by students
waving the Palestinian flag and holding portraits of Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat.
   The demonstrators gathered outside the basilica of St. John the
Lateran to hear a speech by Nemer Hammad, the PLO representative in
Italy.
   ``We want Palestine to return to being the land of peace,''
Hammad told the demonstrators.
   The 14-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip has left at least 380 Palestinians and 15
Israelis dead.
   Near the end of the peaceful demonstration a group of about a
hundred protestors burned an Israeli flag and called for armed
struggle in the occupied territories.

<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Marine says he was coerced into
signing a confession admitting he was a spy, but the government
maintains that Arnold Bracy is a liar who gave away secrets for sex
while in Moscow, CBS News reports.
   In an interview to be aired Sunday on the network's ``60
Minutes'' program, Bracy, of New York, told correspondent Mike
Wallace that he was forced to sign a confession and that Naval
investigators knew it was false.
   ``As I said, the things that they put in that statement that they
accused me of doing I know never happened,'' Bracy said.
   The government had just uncovered a spy for sex scandal in Moscow
in 1987 when Bracy was interrogated. In the confession, which he
later recanted, he admitted a sexual relationship with a Russian
cook at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. He also confessed to allowing
KGB agents roam in the U.S. Embassy.
   In the CBS interview, Bracy denied that he slept with the Russian
woman and said he never allowed KGB agents into the embassy. Bracy
at one time faced a military court-martial but all charges were
dropped when military lawyers concluded they did not have any
corroborating evidence to prosecute.
   He was discharged from the Marines last spring.
   Ron Kessler, a former Washington Post reporter and the author of
a new book on the Moscow spy scandal, also was interviewed by
Wallace.
   Kessler said Bracy allowed KGB agents into the embassy's computer
nerve-center where they planted electronic listening devices. As a
result, Kessler contends that 25 Soviet citizens who worked for the
CIA were exposed and later executed.
   Bracy denied the charge, saying he did not have access to the
computer room.
   But Jim Pender, a Naval Investigative Service agent who
interrogated Bracy, told CBS he is convinced that Bracy was a spy
for the Soviets while stationed in Moscow.
   ``It's my feeling that Bracy has been a liar all his life,''
Pender said.

   The nuclear-powered attack submarine USS
Pasadena joined the Navy's fleet Saturday during commissioning
ceremonies that spurred a peaceful demonstration by anti-nuclear
weapons protesters.
   Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval operations, praised the
Pasadena as the ``most capable attack submarine in the world.'' The
submarine was built at the Electric Boat shipyard here.
   Thirty-five protesters from various New England-based
anti-nuclear weapons groups demonstrated outside the submarine base
in Groton. Joanne Sheehan, of the Norwich-based War Resisters
League, described the protest as a ``simple vigil.''
   ``It was important for people going to the ceremonies to show
them there is opposition to these weapons,'' she said.
   Pasadena is the first submarine and the third Navy ship to bear
the California city's name. The 360-foot submarine displaces 6,900
tons and will carry a crew of 12 officers and 115 enlisted men.

<HEAD>Judge Drops Payola Charges Against Record Promoter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed payola charges
against a San Francisco-area record promoter, saying the counts in
the much-publicized Justice Department investigation were too vague.
   U.S. District Judge Pamela Rymer, in response to a defense
motion, on Friday dismissed three misdemeanor payola counts against
Ralph Tashjian, of San Mateo, on the grounds the grand jury
indictment wasn't specific enough to allow the promoter to defend
himself.
   Court documents showed Tashjian was charged with ``making regular
undisclosed payments or distributions of cocaine to program
directors so the records he was promoting would be added to radio
station play lists.''
   Prosecutor Richard Stavin, a special attorney for the Los Angeles
Organized Crime Strike Force, said the government next week plans to
charge Tashjian with 200 individual counts of payola.
   Stavin attributed the dismissal to a ``weakness in the payola
statute'' that addresses only specific incidents and ``doesn't
contemplate a scheme or ongoing course of action.''
   Tashjian and his wife are set to stand trial later this month on
separate felony tax evasion charges stemming from the payola case.
   Reacting to the judge's ruling, Tashjian's attorney, Anthony P.
Brooklier, said: ``The problem was, the government charged my client
with multiple offenses over a long period of time without specifying
the dates of those alleged offenses or the records involved.''
   The Tashjians, along with another record promoter and a former
radio station manager, were indicted in February 1988 after the
Internal Revenue Service conducted a two-year investigation under
the direction of the Organized Crime Strike Force. Charges against
the other defendants were pending.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Milos Jakes
warned in a report published Saturday that opposition forces are
resorting to ``psychological terror'' against socialists.
   Jakes and party ideologist Jan Fojtik, maintaining a hard line
against dissidents, made clear that the Prague leadership is not
prepared to listen to the Charter 77 human rights movement or other
independent groups.
   Various groups try to rally ``as an opposition,'' and ``their
actions are widely backed and assisted from the West,'' Jakes was
quoted Saturday by the CTK news agency as saying.
   He alleged that the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe and
Voice of America ``and others directly participate in organizing
(anti-socialist forces).''
   Jakes said foes of the system are moving from covert action to
``attempts at open confrontation, including psychological pressure,
intimidation and even psychological terror against people who hold
the positions of socialism.''
   He apparently referred to 80 anonymous ``terrorist letters and
calls'' the party daily Rude Pravo allegedly received, some of them
reportedly wishing communist leaders to be hanged on lamp posts.
   Jakes also expressed the leadership's concern over a petition,
signed by more than 1,000 prominent artists and intellectuals,
calling for the release of jailed dissident and playwright Vaclav
Havel.
   The party chief's toughly worded remarks contrasted with the
official stands on nonconformists in neighboring Hungary and Poland.
   Hungary's Parliament last month approved formation of independent
political groups and Polish authorities are negotiating with the
outlawed Solidarity free trade union on trade union freedom and
other reforms.
   ``We are not calling for dialogue with everybody, only with those
who are willing to contribute to the solution of the problems of our
society,'' Fojtik was quoted as saying. ``We won't have dialogue
forced upon us by those who want to judge our problems from the
positions of the defeated reaction in Feburary 1948'' when the
communists took power.
   According to CTK, Jakes lashed out at ``activities of illegal
religious structures and of some church representatives (and) their
efforts to misuse the religious feelings of part of the believers
against socialism.''
   Czechoslovak Catholic Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, in recent
letters to the regime, has sharply criticized police violence in
breaking up peaceful demonstrations in Prague and called for a
conciliatory official stance.
   Also, Jaroslav Cejka, chief editor of the Czechoslovak Communist
Party's cultural weekly Tvorba Cejka has been fired, apparently for
criticizing a report on a meeting with cultural figures carried by
the party daily Rude Pravo.
   Reporting on a Politburo session Friday, CTK said Cejka was
``relieved of his post'' and ``was entrusted with other duties,'' a
customary cliche for being dismissed.
   The surprising ouster came only two days after Cejka criticized
Rude Pravo in Tvorba Wednesday for ``not doing a very good job''
covering a discussion between Politburo member Miroslav Stepan and a
delegation of cultural figures.
   The meeting was apparently brought about by the artists' petition.

<HEAD>Eds: Forrest and Lissa are cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of calls to the police and fire
departments' 911 emergency number went unanswered Saturday because
of a technical problem that knocked out the system for more than
four hours.
   Authorities said they plan to investigate whether the outage, the
first in the 911 system's five years of operation, resulted in
injury, death or fire damage that could have been avoided had the
system been working properly.
   ``At this point we just don't know,'' said police Capt. Forrest
Lewallen. ``I can say that this is a very serious problem. It is
something that quite obviously we'll have to find remedies to ensure
that it never happens again.''
   The problems began at 1 p.m. when equipment that allows the
Police Department to transfer calls to the Fire Department stopped
working, said Lissa Zanville, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, which
operates the system.
   The equipment failure created a backlog that allowed only one in
five calls to reach a 911 operator at the central communications
center in Los Angeles, where all 911 calls within city limits are
directed, she said.
   From 3 to 3:40 p.m., the system went down entirely and no calls
got through. By 5:14 p.m., Pacific Bell technicians had the system
working again, Ms. Zanville said.
   The number of calls that went unanswered was unknown, but the
system normally handles 5,000 to 7,000 calls a day, and a four-hour
breakdown would easily have left hundreds of calls unanswered, said
Lewallen.
   Not all of those unanswered calls would be emergencies. Lewallen
said that about 75 percent of the 4 million calls dialed each year
on 911 are emergencies, with the rest usually non-emergency calls or
pranks.
   The Sheriff's Department and the county Fire Department, which
don't operate on the city's communications system, were unaffected
by the outage, authorities said.

   President Najib on Saturday accused
Pakistan of massing troops along the border in preparation for an
invasion and eventual annexation of Afghanistan.
   The government also released 20 imprisoned Iranians to improve
relations with its western neighbor, but an Iranian diplomat said
his country will not be satisfied until Moslem guerrillas win the
civil war.
   In a speech broadcast on national radio and television, Najib
said his government had received information Pakistan planned first
to attack Jalalabad, about 80 miles east of Kabul and 50 miles west
of the Pakistan border.
   ``Militarist and reactionary parties envisage swallowing our
country and turning it into a fifth province of Pakistan,'' the
president said in his strongest attack yet on Afghanistan's neighbor.
   Pakistan has allowed Moslem guerrillas fighting Najib's
Soviet-backed government to operate from Pakistan.
   Pakistan, the United States and Iran have supported the
guerrillas, who began fighting in 1978 after the communists took
power in a coup. In 1979, the Soviets sent troops into Afghanistan
to prop up the pro-Marxist government.
   Under a U.N.-mediated accord, all Soviet troops must be withdrawn
by Wednesday. Radio Moscow reported Saturday the last motorized army
unit was within 125 miles of the Soviet border.
   The guerrillas are not party to the U.N. accord and want to
overthrow Najib's government when the Soviets are gone.
   Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 20
Iranian prisoners were freed to commemorate the 10th anniversary of
the Iranian revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   ``They're being released as a goodwill gesture toward the Iranian
government,'' he told a news conference.
   Iran's highest-ranking diplomat in Kabul, Charge d'Affaires
Hussein Intizari, welcomed the release but said it will not improve
relations.
   ``We are waiting for a government with the mujahedeen,'' he said.
   The prisoners appeared to be in good health, but many showed
reporters scars and missing teeth and said they had been repeatedly
beaten and tortured.
   The Afghan government had no immediate comment on the allegations.
   With the withdrawal deadline approaching, Najib exhorted the
Afghan people to protect their nation's sovereignty.
   ``Say in one voice: `Country or death,''' he said.
   He also accused the Pakistani military of controlling the
guerrillas.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, there appeared to be no end to the bitter
disputes among guerrilla factions over the composition of a
provisional Islamic government they want to form.
   At issue is how power would be shared by the seven insurgent
groups in Pakistan and the eight factions based in Iran.
   On Friday, 526 guerrillas and other Afghans met as a council to
decide the matter but the Iranian-based alliance walked out.
   Rasul Sayyaf, the spokesman for the meeting, said Saturday the
council would meet ``in two or three days.''
   He said efforts to persuade the Iranian-based guerrillas not to
boycott the council failed.
   ``We cannot expect quick solutions to the problem of
Afghanistan,'' he said at a news conference.
   Radio Moscow said patrols along the Salang Highway, the main
route between Kabul and the Soviet border, were being discontinued.
   According to the report, the last motorized Soviet unit traveled
through a mountain pass on the Salang Highway. It did not say how
many troops or what kind of equipment were in the unit.
   The report also said a ``small group'' of soldiers will remain in
Kabul, the Afghan capital, to guard the airport until the Soviets
complete a massive food airlift.
   A Soviet officer, Col. Pavel Vinokunov, said in Kabul the airlift
will continue until Monday and his men will depart then.
   Col. Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the military chief of staff, has said
the last Soviet soldier will leave Afghanistan on Tuesday.
   Soviet officials have said the Red Army contingent in Afghanistan
numbered 115,000 before the pullout began May 15 and that half had
left by Aug. 15.

   Afghanistan on Saturday released 20
Iranians imprisoned for political crimes, extending an olive branch
to the Tehran government.
   Iran rebuffed the move and most of the freed prisoners claimed
they had been beaten and tortured by the Afghans.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the prisoners
were released to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the revolution
in Iran that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power.
   ``They be being released as goodwill gesture toward the Iranian
government,'' Amani told a news conference.
   Iran's highest-raking diplomat in Kabul, Charge d'Affairs Hussein
Intizari, welcomed the release but said it would not help improve
relations between Kabul and Tehran.
   Iran supports the efforts of the Moslem guerrillas, or
mujahedeen, fighting to overthrow the government of President Najib,
who has been supported by Soviet troops since December 1979. Soviet
forces are in the final days of a withdrawal to be completed by
Wednesday under a U.N.-sponsored agreement.
   ``We have not recognized this government for the past 10 years.
How can it improve relations?'' Intizari asked shortly before he
greeted the former prisoners at a hotel in Kabul.
   ``We are waiting for a government with the mujahedeen,'' he said.
   The 20 men had been imprisoned for 2 to 10 years after they were
tried and convicted of various political crimes, including aiding
the Moslem rebels.
   All appeared to be in good health, although many showed reporters
scars they said were caused by cigarette brns, missing teeth, and
said they had were repeatedly beaten and tortured.
   The Afghan government had no immediate comment on the allegations.
   Seventeen of the men were to be flown to Tehran on Sunday,
Intizari said. One man claimd he was Afghan and will stay in the
country. The other two said they did not want to go back to Iran and
were released to the International Red Cross in Kabul.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Wants Cuba To Help Fight Drug War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is looking to Cuba as an ally
in the war against illegal drugs, according to a published report.
   The New York Daily News in its Sunday editions quoted
unidentified sources as saying that, despite the longtime freeze in
relations between the United States and Cuba, ``initiatives are
being discussed'' through numerous channels with Cuban President
Fidel Castro, seeking his cooperation in stopping drug shipments
from South America.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified U.S. government officials as
saying that the contacts are motivated by the United States'
inability to stem the flow of illegal drugs.
   The ``cautious'' contacts with the Communist country grew out of
a December meeting in Havana between Castro and a visiting American
delegation that included U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman
of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, the
News reported.
   In the past, the United States has accused Castro of harboring
drug traffickers and encouraging them to smuggle illegal drugs to
the United States.
   After his visit with Castro, Rangel told U.S. officials that
``Cuba wants very much to work with both the United States and Latin
America on narcotics control,'' the Daily News reported
   Should the United States and Cuba agree to cooperate in the war
on drugs, the U.S. government could face an uproar from the
Cuban-American community, the News said.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Jerry Brown began what he said
could be a political comeback Saturday night by winning the
previously obscure California Democratic Party chair.
   Brown defeated Steve Westly, a party official unknown to the
general public, 1,554-762, in voting by some 2,300 delegates at the
party's annual convention.
   Brown's bid to return to the public arena overshadowed other
events at the convention, including speeches by most of the major
contenders for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1990 and
the addresses of 1988 presidential hopefuls Richard Gephardt and
Jesse Jackson.
   The two-time candidate for president picked the race as the
vehicle to end the six-year, self-imposed political exile which
began after he concluded his two terms as governor with a losing
campaign for the U.S. Senate.
   Brown, 50, once dubbed ``Gov. Moonbeam'' by his critics, spent
part of that exile in seclusion writing in Mexico and Japan, part
working Mother Teresa's hospital in Calcutta, India, and part on a
CARE hunger project in Bangladesh.
   Brown readily confirmed Friday that if he won the chair's office,
he would probably seek higher offices in the future. But if he lost
it would be the most embarrassing, and possibly the final, loss of
his public career.
   Brown said he was confident of victory in Saturday's vote. But
his opponent, current vice chair Westly of Menlo Park, said he
surveyed more than half of the voting delegates and found Brown
leading by only 556 to 525 with 585 undecided.
   In speeches to the delegates Saturday, Brown promised ``to
mobilize the millions and millions of non-voters'' to rejoin the
political process.
   ``You will not see my face on the cover of Time magazine,''
Westly, 33, an investment banker and longtime party volunteer, told
the delegates. ``But I have a different strength. I get the job
done.''
   Brown wrapped up a three-month campaign for the post with
endorsements from most of the state's most prominent Democratic
politicians, including U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown and state Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti.
   But at least two dozen Democratic officeholders and county
chairmen publicly opposed Brown, contending that his presence as
official head of the party would breathe new life into Republican
attacks against the most controversial events of his governship from
1975 through 1982 and be a liability for Democratic candidates in
1990.
   The bid for the obscure post of party chair by a former governor
was unprecedented in California politics, and it overshadowed all
other business of the three-day Democratic State Convention that
started Friday.
   In an appearance Friday before the Sacramento Press Club, Brown
described his $150,000 campaign as his re-entry into politics and a
possible stepping stone back to higher office. But he repeated his
pledge that if elected he wouldn't seek any higher office until his
term as chair is completed.
   ``I'm not running for anything in the next four years,'' Brown
said, adding that ``obviously, I don't intend it to be my terminal
position (in politics). But where I go next, or where I'm invited to
go next, will depend completely on the success of what I've embarked
upon here.''
   Brown said that as chairman he would devote his full attention to
party fund-raising, building local committees and clubs and party
registration and get-out-the-the vote drives.
   He conceded that he often ignored the party while governor, and
that the ``nuts-and-bolts'' administrative duties of state chair are
exactly the things he tended to neglect as governor. But he said his
priorities are different now.
   ``There has been a lot of discussion about my administrative
ability. I've thought a lot about that over the last six years, and
it's true ... a good manager (requires) doing things in a very
structured manner, which is certainly not my natural inclination.''
   He said changes in state laws giving the party more influence and
the need to reverse declining voter participation trends to
revitalize the Democratic Party all make the chair's job more
important and challenging.

   Tamil rebels armed with automatic
rifles, machetes and clubs attacked a remote jungle village in
central Sri Lanka and killed 34 Sinhalese, authorities said Sunday.
   Elsewhere in the island nation, nine other people were killed as
violence escalated with the approach of Wednesday's parliamentary
election. One of the victims was an opposition party candidate, the
14th would-be legislator to die since campaigning started five weeks
ago.
   More than 50 rebels crept into the village of Dutuwewa late
Saturday night and surprised the sleeping residents, said a police
officer contacted by telephone in nearby Horawapatana.
   Military officials in Colombo said the victims included 20
children and five women. At least four people in the village
survived by fleeing into the thick undergrowth, said the officials,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Dutuwewa is about 60 miles northeast of Colombo, the capital. The
village is in predominantly Sinhalese North Central Province but
lies just outside Eastern Province, a main area of operations by
Tamil separatists.
   A Foreign Ministry official in Colombo blamed the killings on the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most powerful of the Tamil
guerrilla groups that have been waging a bloody independence
campaign since 1983.
   The Tigers issued a statement denying responsibility for the
attack.
   It was the second massacre of Sinhalese civilians in the region
this month. On Feb. 3 at least 11 people were killed in Eastern
Province's Amparai district about 100 miles southeast of Duduwewa.
   More than 8,500 have died in the ethnic violence as the minority
Tamils pressed their attacks on the Sinhalese majority and
Sinhalese-dominated government.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and live
mostly in Northern and Eastern provinces. They claim they are
discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of
the population.
   In the south, parliamentary candidate Somapala Amarakeerthi, his
brother and a supporter were killed Saturday by attackers wearing
camouflage uniforms, military officials said. In the eastern town of
Sammanturai, six supporters of President Ranasinghe Premadasa's
United National Party were shot and killed by unknown attackers, the
officials said.

<TEXT>
   Police opened fire Sunday on Moslem
fundamentalists who stormed a U.S. government center in this city.
Doctors said at least five people were killed and at least 30 were
reported injured.
   The gunfire broke out when more than 2,000 fundamentalist
protesters marched toward the United States Information Center to
demand banning of a novel, ``The Satanic Verses'' by Salman Rushdie.
   Police repeatedly opened fire with rifles and semi-automatic
weapons on the charging protesters, who hurled rocks and bricks in
fierce fighting in the heart of the capital.
   Witnesses said the protesters ripped down the U.S. flag and tore
shutters off the building. Protesters who broke into the building,
which had been closed, smashed windows and started several small
fires.
   U.S. officials had no immediate word on damage.
   ``American dogs'' and ``God is great,'' the protesters screamed
as they hurled rocks at the building and drove away scores of police
trying to guard it.
   ``Hang Salman Rushdie,'' one protester yelled.
   Doctors at area hospitals, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said at least five people were killed by police gunfire and many
were injured.
   Pakistan's official news agency said 30 people were injured.
   Police kept the demonstrators at bay for almost an hour before
they gathered strength and moved toward the center, which houses a
library, a cultural center and the offices of the United States
Information Agency.
   An unknown number of police were also injured by rocks, and some
were beaten by the crowd.
   Pakistan, India, and some Arab nations have banned the ``The
Satanic Verses,'' which is named after verses the Prophet Mohammed
removed from the Koran _ the Islamic holy book _ on grounds they
were inspired by the devil.
   Earlier this month, about 3,000 Moslems demonstrated in the
English city of Birmingham to protest the book, which they consider
blasphemous.

   About 15 knife-wielding youths robbed passengers on
an inter-city train early Sunday and attacked some who resisted,
resulting in some injuries, Transport Police said.
   ``At least 11 people were robbed of cash, jewelery and other
valuables and two people were taken to a hospital with head and neck
injuries,'' said a police official, speaking anonymously in keeping
with British custom.
   ``We believe there are other passengers who were robbed and have
not yet come forward.''
   Police said the youths are thought to have boarded the 1:37 a.m.
train to London's King's Cross station at St. Albans, 19 miles
northwest of London. The train was traveling from Bedford, 46 miles
north of London.
   Police could not estimate the value of goods stolen.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of angry television viewers
called the Norwegian Embassy, major newspapers and conservationists
to react to a film about Norwegian seal hunting, Swedish media
reported Sunday.
   The documentary ran on Swedish television Saturday night and
showed seal puppies being clubbed to death and seals apparently
being skinned alive.
   ``I have never seen anything as disgusting. I am boycotting
Norway,'' 23-year-old Freddie Karlsson told the Aftonbladet daily.
   Some viewers called police to threaten attacks on Norwegian
installations, said Swedish radio.
   The film, ``About Seals and Humans,'' reportedly triggered
similar outrage when it ran on Danish and British television last
week.
   It has not been shown in Norway, which is lobbying to end a 1983
European Community ban on importing seal pup skin.
   Former Norwegian seal inspector Odd F. Lindberg filmed the
documentary aboard a vessel off Greenland in 1987 and 1988.

<HEAD>North Accuses South of Shooting Across Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea on Sunday accused South Korean
troops of firing across the border at its policemen.
   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said the firing
``gravely threatened the safety of the civilian policemen of our
side on routine duty at the post.'' It did not mention any injuries
or damage.
   ``It was entirely due to the patience and self-control of the
civilian policemen of our side that this incident did not expand
into an arms conflict between the two sides,'' said the agency,
monitored in Tokyo.
   It said several South Korean soldiers fired ``many bullets'' from
automatic rifles Sunday afternoon from the Chosan military police
post in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the two Koreas.
   The post is west of Munsan, a city about 25 miles north of Seoul
and about 10 miles south of the truce village of Panmunjom in the
DMZ.
   ``The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are
committing one military provocation after another on the ground and
in the sea while staging the adventurous `Team Spirit 89' joint
military maneuvers,'' the report said.
   ``This clearly shows how desperately they are making new war
provocation moves to invade the northern half of Korea, bringing the
situation of the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain,''
it said.
   Team Spirit is an annual U.S.-South Korean joint military
exercise, described as purely defensive. The North, however, says it
is a rehearsal for invasion and has demanded it be canceled to
improve the atmosphere for North-South talks.
   The two sides have held a number of contacts in recent months
aimed at easing tensions and exploring ways to reunify the peninsula.
   The North and the South have been divided since 1945. They fought
a bloody war in 1950-53 after the North invaded the South.

   A Hindu family in southern India has been
reverently tending a sacred fire for 1,128 years, a news agency
reported Sunday.
   Tradition holds that the fire, although sometimes reduced to
glowing embers, has never been extinguished since it was lit.
   The Press Trust of India reported that the fire burns in a pit in
the home of Neelakandhan Namboodiri at the village of Cheruvathery,
in the southwest coastal state of Kerala.
   It quoted Namboodiri as saying his family kept the fire burning
by sprinkling it three times a day with coconut, butter and a
combination of nine grains.
   The ritual is designed to attain peace and spiritual and material
happiness, but Namboodiri said it is also costly. The news agency
quoted him as saying it takes about $3 a day to keep the fire
burning.
   Namboodiri said copper plates found during excavations in 1949
say the fire was lit in 861 A.D. by Maharishi Vikala Nethreeyacharya.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The still unsolved bombing of Pan Am Flight 103
over Scotland has brought more stringent security for U.S. airlines,
congressional inquiries and a move to increase international efforts
against air terrorism.
   Although tight airport security has all but eliminated hijackings
in the United States, the Dec. 21 bombing of the Boeing 747 that
killed 259 people en route to New York and 11 more on the ground
raises the spectre of a more deadly kind of air terrorism.
   It also raises questions about how to respond to the more than
900 threats against U.S. airlines each year, including when to warn
the public.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials told two congressional
committees last week that airlines have greatly increased security
measures for foreign flights since the bombing of Flight 103.
   All checked baggage is X-rayed. Passengers are denied any access
to baggage after check-in. Passengers are matched with bags to guard
against unaccompanied baggage. Additional measures prevent
unauthorized access to luggage or planes. And more passengers are
subjected to random enhanced screening with suitcases actually
opened by inspectors.
   ``We will not hesitate to tilt the balance toward improved
security and away from convenience when that is necessary to protect
our citizens,'' FAA Administrator Allan McArtor told one of two
congressional hearings last week.
   He indicated those measures and others _ which airlines will not
discuss _ have brought little complaint.
   But airline officials and members of Congress want the increased
security imposed on foreign carriers flying into the United States
as well. The Air Transport Association, which represents U.S.
carriers, estimates that 50 percent of international travel by U.S.
citizens is on foreign airlines.
   ``Beefing up security only for U.S. carriers would be like having
policemen patrol only odd numbered streets,'' said Richard F. Lally,
association vice president for security.
   Raymond A. Salazar, FAA director for civil aviation security,
told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that U.S. airlines are
considered the major target for terrorists and that attempting to
impose unilateral restrictions on foreign carriers could start ``an
air war.''
   But Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner hopes to reach a
consensus on international security measures at this week's special
meeting of the 33-member Council of the International Civil Aviation
Organization in Montreal. The United States and Great Britain called
for the meeting to discuss steps to take following the Pan Am
bombing.
   In addition to U.S. inability to control foreign airlines and
airports, authorities trying to combat terrorist attacks against
airliners face weapons that X-rays can't detect and threats that
often come from sources they can't identify.
   At least two devices are under development that can detect
plastic explosives such as those investigators believe were planted
in luggage aboard Flight 103.
   One is an explosive vapor detection system that checks people for
explosives. FAA officials say preliminary tests were conducted at
Boston's Logan Airport but it is still in the testing stage.
   The FAA has already tested and used two $1 million ``thermal
neutron analysis'' machines at California airports and has ordered
six more. Airline officials say the units should be sent right away
to high-risk airports in Europe and the Middle East. The FAA has
identified 73 airports which it considers the most vulnerable to
terrorism.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., has asked the FAA to determine how
many machines would be needed for critical airports, how much they
will cost and who ought to pay for them.
   In another congressional inquiry, Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill.,
chairwoman of the Government Operations transportation subcommittee
which plans hearings on Flight 103 next month, has asked the FAA to
provide details of its procedures for warning of threats against
aviation.
   In letters last week to the FAA and Pan Am, Collins asked for
documents relating to a telephone threat received by the U.S.
Embassy in Helsinki against Pan Am flights from Frankfurt to New
York two weeks before Flight 103 was destroyed. The State Department
says the threat was a hoax and no public warning was made, but a
notice disclosing the threat was posted on the Moscow Embassy
bulletin board eight days before the explosion.
   L. Paul Bremer, ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, told
Congress the notice should not have been posted and said the
government has a policy of not issuing such warning unless they are
also made to the general public.
   He said if warnings were issued for every threat, it could
cripple commercial aviation.
   But survivors of Flight 103 victims, in a statement last week,
said passengers should be provided, on request, details of any
threat against a flight they plan to take.

   Americans overwhelmingly support Washington's
overtures to the Palestine Liberation Organization but are deeply
suspicious of the PLO and dubious of its claim to have abandoned
terrorism, according to a national poll.
   Only 6 percent of those interviewed in the Media
General-Associated Press survey said they believed the PLO's recent
renunciation of terrorism, while 74 percent said the group just made
that claim for political gain. The rest were unsure.
   Respondents were split on whether the PLO would coexist with
Israel or sought to destroy it, and a strong majority said other
groups could represent the Palestinian people.
   Still, the distrust was tempered by the desire for an end to the
Mideast conflict. A majority said Israel should negotiate with the
PLO, although most said the United States should not force it to do
so.
   The survey also found some frustration with Israel's support
groups in the United States, with 35 percent saying they had too
much influence on U.S. policy. Twenty percent said pro-Palestinan
groups had too much influence.
   The poll was conducted among 1,162 adults Jan. 4-12, following
PLO leader Yasser Arafat's statement recognizing Israel and
renouncing terrorism. Israel rejected the move as a ploy, but the
United States responded by opening its first talks with the PLO.
   Sixty-seven percent approved of U.S.-PLO talks, with the rest
split between disapproval and no opinion. Support was highest among
college-educated Americans, with eight in 10 approving.
   Respondents, moreover, endorsed a major tenet of the Palestinian
cause: Sixty-two percent said the Palestinians should have their own
country. Just 11 percent said no, and 27 percent had no opinion.
   Roughly a quarter of the respondents had no view on many of the
questions posed, reflecting the distance of Mideast issues from the
daily concerns of many Americans. Significantly more men expressed
opinions than did women.
   The most-educated respondents, those with post-graduate
educations, were more likely to favor dealings with the PLO. While
62 percent overall said Israel should negotiate with the PLO, for
example, that swelled to 79 percent of the most-educated group.
   Also, 60 percent of the most-educated group said Israel should
allow the creation of a Palestinian state on territory it now
occupies in exchange for recognition from the PLO. Among all
respondents, just 44 percent agreed.
   But the share of respondents who believed the PLO has given up
terrorism remained low in all groups, peaking at just 11 percent of
the most-educated. One-third overall thought the PLO wants to
destroy Israel, about a third believed the PLO would coexist with
Israel, and the last third weren't sure.
   More of the most-educated group, 55 percent, said the PLO would
co-exist with Israel. But six in 10 of that group, and five in 10
overall, said the United States should not recognize the Palestinian
state the PLO declared in November. The rest were split between
support for recognition and no opinion.
   Israel has said that it will not negotiate with the PLO because
the PLO's charter calls for Israel's destruction, but that it would
negotiate with other representatives of the Palestinians. Other Arab
nations, however, have declared the PLO the only legitimate
representative of the Palestinians.
   In the survey, 63 percent said some group other than the PLO
could represent the Palestinians in negotiations with Israel. And
nearly seven respondents in 10 said the United States should not try
to force Israel to negotiate with the PLO by threatening sanctions.
   The survey had a three-point margin of sampling error.

<HEAD>Tawanese Pilot Says He Planned Flight to China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The pilot of a Taiwanese fighter jet that crashed
in China said on state-run television Sunday he had planned the
flight, and Taiwan newspapers claimed he carried military secrets to
the communists.
   A local Chinese television station broadcast an interview with
Lt. Col. Lin Xianshun, 35, who parachuted to safety Saturday morning
180 miles north of Canton, capital of southeastern Guangdong
province.
   Lin said he flew the F-5E jet fighter to China of his own free
will. He also said none of his family knew about his plans. He did
not elaborate.
   None of the Chinese reports made clear whether Lin requested
asylum. In the past, the state media always have given prominent
coverage to military defectors from Taiwan.
   China's nationally televised news said Sunday night that Lin had
been ``warmly welcomed'' by officers from China's air force after
his plane crashed into a rice paddy, reportedly after running out of
oil.
   It showed Lin's mangled jet and of Lin shaking hands with Chinese
air force officers. It said he was treated in a hospital for slight
injuries.
   Earlier reports from China and Taiwan said Lin wanted to find his
relatives in China.
   A China News Service report said he had asked Chinese authorities
to find an uncle, Lin Yuyi.
   ``But authorities have yet to find the uncle,'' said an official
at the state news agency in Canton, contacted by telephone from
Beijing.
   In Taiwan, a relative of the pilot said he believed Lin defected
to China to see his grandmother.
   The relative, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity,
said Lin complained that military officers were banned from visiting
China.
   In 1987, the Nationalist government eased a ban to allow all
Taiwanese, except military and government personnel, to visit China.
   In Taiwan, the liberal Independence Evening Post quoted
unidentified sources as saying Lin took ``several important
documents'' about the strength of Taiwan's air force to China. It
said he took the documents from his squadron, which trained selected
pilots as ``enemy forces'' during mock air battles.
   The mass-circulation China Times Express said Lin might reveal to
the Chinese a military blueprint for the defense of eastern Taiwan
from possible Chinese attacks. Defense Ministry officials refused
comment on the reports.
   Taiwan's state broadcasting corporation reported authorities have
taken Lin's wife, daughter and son to Chihhang Air Base for
questioning.
   More than a dozen Taiwanese air force officers have sought asylum
in China and 19 Chinese military personnel have defected to Taiwan
since 1949 when the Nationalists lost a civil war to communist
forces on the mainland.

<HEAD>Outspoken Former Congressman Gets His Chance To Attack Homeless Problem</HEAD>

   Writing 10 years ago, Jack Kemp said the
Department of Housing and Urban Development's programs ``are
consistently misguided and scandalous.''
   Kemp, who took over last week as the new secretary of that
department, is getting his chance to improve those programs, or what
survives of them after a decade of pressure on domestic spending.
   The former New York congressman comes to HUD at a time when the
problems it deals with have gained heightened visibility. The
nation's homeless population is growing and increasingly includes
families unable to afford or obtain housing, according to surveys
conducted by the nation's big-city mayors.
   Kemp and President Bush have both acknowledged the problem of
homelessness.
   Kemp, who offered the harsh description of HUD in his 1979 book
``An American Renaissance,'' last month called homelessness ``a
national tragedy of appalling proportions.'' He pledged new
spending, and last week Bush included increases for emergency
shelters in his new budget proposal.
   But both also have stressed that there are limits to what the
federal government will attempt on homelessness and housing, and
advocates of urban programs are watching Kemp closely for evidence
he will back up his enthusiastic talk about innovation and new ideas.
   ``He's not got a good record, but he has made very positive
statements about homelessness lately, and he has recognized
homelessness is a major scandal that has to be addressed,'' said
Maria Foscarinis, Washington counsel for the National Coalition for
the Homeless.
   ``Now the question is, will he come through?'' she said.
   After a swearing-in ceremony by Bush at HUD's offices Monday, the
new secretary plans to begin visiting inner cities, starting Tuesday
with a trip to Atlanta.
   Mayor Andrew Young will lead him on a tour of housing projects
and to meetings with public-housing tenants, including one at the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center, said Sandra Walker, Young's press
secretary.
   The Atlanta visit is a logical one for Kemp, who frequently
quotes the late civil rights leader the center if named after and
actively sought black support as an unsuccessful rival to Bush for
the GOP presidential nomination. That outreach to blacks is a goal
of the Republican Party under Bush and, as secretary of HUD, Kemp is
in a position to aid that cause.
   Kemp is a conservative Republican who speaks forcefully of
empowering the poor by encouraging the creation of more private jobs
rather than more federal spending. Urban advocates, some openly
saying they want to educate him about the need for more federal
spending, have invited him to visit other cities too.
   ``We're convinced that Mr. Kemp will change'' after seeing
programs firsthand, said Richard Y. Nelson Jr., executive director
of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials.
   Although there is wide disagreement over just how many people are
homeless in the country, urban advocates are convinced the problem
is growing. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, in a survey of 27 major
cities, concluded last month that the problem increased in nearly
all those cities during 1988 and that in two-thirds of them people
were turned away because shelters were full.
   The mayors also found that one in four homeless people were
children.
   To deal with the emergency cases, Bush proposed $144 million in
new spending in his fiscal 1990 budget, including full funding of
the McKinney Act passed by Congress providing temporary shelter.
   The budget, however, includes no money for additional units of
subsidized permanent housing for low income people, beyond the level
of former President Reagan's proposal. Spending for housing programs
declined some 80 percent during the Reagan years, and a dwindling
supply of affordable housing is what mayors cite as the major cause
for homelessness.
   ``Shelters are not the answer,'' Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn
said. ``Permanent affordable housing _ that is the answer.''
   Like Reagan, Bush would rely heavily on use of housing vouchers,
which are certificates for subsidy that renters use as partial
payment of their rents. But critics say those don't help a family
find housing when no affordable units are available, and that HUD
under Reagan virtually stopped subsidizing the construction of new
affordable housing units.
   ``Vouchers work in some housing markets, but when the units
aren't there, vouchers don't get you anywhere,'' Foscarinis said.
   Her organization is backing a bill introduced in the House that
would provide $2 billion to fix up vacant housing units and, backers
say, eventually house 1 million people. So far, she says, the group
is still waiting to hear from Kemp.

   The prospect of the Soviet Union's Mikhail
Gorbachev and China's Deng Xiaoping shaking hands at their upcoming
summit is causing surprisingly little anxiety in Washington.
   Several years ago, reports of high-level chumminess between the
two communist giants would have caused sleepless nights among U.S.
officials, wary of a renewed military and political pact between the
powerful neighbors.
   But Asian and Soviet experts in and out of government say the
relaxation of tensions between China and the Soviet Union, while not
totally to America's advantage, could produce some positive steps in
the Pacific region.
   ``Whatever concerns we might have had four years ago, had this
come suddenly, have now been gradually reduced,'' said Paul
Kreisberg, a specialist in Asian matters with the Carnegie Endowment
for International Affairs.
   ``No one now expects the Soviets and the Chinese to restart the
security alliance they had in the 1950s,'' Kreisberg said, pointing
to comments from Deng that his moves toward easing tensions with the
Soviets are not designed to damage U.S.-Chinese relations.
   Gorbachev is to travel to Beijing in May for the summit with
Deng, marking the first top-level meetings between the two countries
since Nikita Khrushchev met with Mao Zedong in 1959. The sessions
are designed to formally end the 30 years of hostility between the
one-time rivals for leadership of the communist world and ``achieve
a complete normalization of relations,'' Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze announced last week.
   ``There may be some Americans who are anxious about this,'' said
Joyce Kallgren, a director of the Institute for East Asian Studies
at the University of California at Berkeley.
   Ms. Kallgren points to the rapid growth of the economic
relationship between the United States and China, arguing that there
is little reason for the Chinese to disturb that trend. And the
Sino-Soviet relationship ``has a long way to go'' to match it, she
said.
   ``Are we beginning to see the kind of close (Chinese-Soviet)
relationship that we saw 30 years ago? It seems to me that there are
a lot of reasons why that analogy is a very limited value,'' she
said.
   ``There hasn't been much of a wringing of hands,'' agreed a
senior State Department official who follows Soviet affairs. ``We've
had a chance to get used to this idea. ... It's been coming for
years.''
   The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified by
name, said the Soviet move to mend the ties that had been cut in
1960 began under former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. The Chinese
felt threatened by the Soviet-backed Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia
and the Soviet intrusion into Afghanistan, and the effort to improve
the atmosphere did not revive until Gorbachev came into power.
   Needing to develop their economies, both nations have strong
domestic reasons to alleviate tensions and reduce military forces
along their 4,500-mile border.
   Washington is not alarmed by the upcoming summit, the U.S.
official continued, because the two countries ``are not going to
create a combined Sino-Soviet threat _ not a military one, not an
economic one, not a political one.''
   The Soviets also are meeting Chinese concerns with their
withdrawal from Afghanistan and support for a Vietnamese withdrawal
from Cambodia. Another positive result could be a lessening of
tension on the Korean peninsula, where the two powers have vied for
influence with North Korea's Kim Il Sung, the experts point out.
   And by appearing to be less of a military threat in the Pacific,
the Soviets are seeking to increase their economic and trade
connections with nations enjoying the Asian ``economic miracle,''
such as Japan, the Carnegie's Kreisberg said.
   Former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance wrote recently that the
United States might see ``more reason for hope than fear'' in the
change.
   ``These two men ... have it in their power not only to end
formally a long period of hostility but also to make an enormous
contribution to peace,'' Vance wrote in a joint essay published by
Time Magazine with Richard Holbrooke, who worked with Vance as an
assistant secretary for east Asian affairs when President Carter
established full diplomatic relations with Beijing.
   Although the United States may lose some of the advantage gained
by having its own full diplomatic ties with two powers that did not
speak formally to one another, they wrote that ``the United States
should not fear the ending of its monopoly of the Big Three summit
dialogue.''
   Other experts note that since the United States has entered a
phase of improved relations with the Soviet Union, it would be
expected that China forge better ties with its own neighbor.
   ``This brings a balance into the (three-way) relationship,'' said
another U.S. official, a specialist in Asian affairs who also asked
not to be quoted by name.
   President Bush's upcoming trip to China _ and his assertion that
he is not deploying ``a China card'' by flaunting relations with
Beijing over Moscow _ demonstrates that the level of diplomacy among
the three nations has reached a new plane.
   ``The need for each nation to play off one off another has
markedly declined,'' the senior U.S. official said.

<TEXT>
   As the last Soviet troops prepare to
leave Afghanistan, a key question remains: Can the Afghan air force
keep open Kabul's airport, the capital's vital link to the outside
world?
   Col. Pavel Vinokunov, commander of a small Soviet guard
detachment at the airport, has no doubts.
   ``The Afghan pilots have been trained in the Soviet Union and
have continued to study here with us,'' said Vinokunov, who has been
in Afghanistan more than two years. ``They'll be able to handle it,
no worse than we did.''
   His words should be put to the test this week, sometime before
Wednesday, the deadine for the Red Army to be out of Afghanistan.
   Kabul, a city of about 2 million, is surrounded by high mountain
passes, which are relatively easy for the U.S.-backed rebels to
block to cut the flow of goods to the capital. Winter snow and
avalanches add to the problem of bringing in supplies.
   With no obvious end in sight to the 10-year-old civil war, the
Kabul airport will be the key link to the rest of the world.
   The rebels are armed with sophisticated, heat-seeking missiles.
   The airport has not come under a rebel rocket attack in more than
a month, and no airliner has been shot down over Kabul. But the
threat has scared off all civilian aircraft except Afghanistan's
Ariana Airline and an occasional U.N. plane.
   On Sunday, though, a U.N. program to bring emergency supplies to
the capital was interrupted when an Ethiopian Airlines jet carrying
the goods was ordered by the Ethiopian government not to fly in.
   Since early January, giant Soviet military transport planes have
been airlifting daily hundreds of tons of flour to help ease food
shortages in the capital.
   Helicopters circle the snow-covered mountains, searching for
guerrillas and providing a screen of flares to deflect their
heat-seeking missiles.
   ``We would like to give it all up right now and go home,'' said
Alexander Kharenko, 26, of Byelorussia. ``But we'll finish the job.
We'll help the Afghans. It's winter and things are rough. There's
hunger in the city. It's no secret.''
   Vinokunov invited Western reporters to the airport to watch their
operation and then to his quarters for tea, sausage, liver pate and
vodka.
   The mujahedeen, as the Moslem rebels are called, say many in the
air force are sympathetic to their cause and will not block the
overthrow of President Najib. Several Afghan pilots have defected to
Pakistan, which supports the rebels.
   Foreign diplomats in Kabul, however, say the air force is an
elite ideologically motivated group that is closely watched by the
ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   Rahman, a 27-year-old pilot who studied for three years in the
Soviet Union, does not hide his feelings about the mujahedeen.
   ``They fire their rockets, but they don't know where they will
land. They have no way of being accurate,'' he said, standing with
several Soviet pilots next to a helicopter gunship.
   ``I like flying and I like to go out and meet them,'' said
Rahman, nicknamed ``Eagle.''
   ``I've seen these groups and wiped them out,'' he said as Soviet
soldiers laughed and patted him on the back. ``I'm good at shooting
them. Come for a ride with me and we'll find some to shoot at.''
   The Soviet departure perhaps will have a psychological impact,
but in practice, the Afghan air force already shepherds Afghan
planes arriving in and leaving Kabul.
   ``Afraid of them? They are afraid of us,'' said Rahman.

<HEAD>New Demo Leader Says Jackson Has ``Tremendous'' Leadership Qualities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald H. Brown, newly elected chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, said Sunday that Jesse Jackson has
the skills and capabilities to be a ``terrific national leader.''
   However, Brown avoided answering directly when asked whether he
thought Jackson _ whom he formerly served as an adviser _ was fit to
be president.
   Brown, a lawyer with a politically active Washington firm, was
elected DNC chairman on Friday, becoming the first black to attain
that post.
   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Brown said when questioned
about Jackson: ``I happen to think that Jesse Jackson is one of the
brightest, one of the quickest, one of the sharpest people that I
have ever met or worked with. He certainly has tremendous leadership
qualities and skills.''
   Asked again whether he believes Jackson _ who waged a vigorous
but unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination
last year _ is fit to be president, Brown replied:
   ``I think he has the skills and the capabilities to be a terrific
national leader. Now whether it's at the presidential level or at
other levels, I think the American people will have to decide.''
   Brown said the Democratic Party has to define itself more clearly
so that it will have a better chance of winning back white male
voters in the South and West who have voted Republican in recent
presidential elections.
   ``I think if you asked the average voter in the '40s and '50s and
'60s what a Democrat was, what a Democrat stood for, they'd be able
to tell you. But in recent years we have allowed our opponents, our
adversaries, our enemies to define us as a party,'' he said. ``You
cannot win when your opponents set the ground rules.''
   Brown added: ``I think once we start defining ourselves in a
clear and concise and consistent way that the American people
understand, we're going to get back those voters. They're going to
understand that the last thing we need in this country is two
Republican Parties _ one is plenty enough.''

   Two earthquakes struck Algeria on Sunday,
but there were no reports of damage or injuries, officials said.
   The first quake hit an area about 30 miles east of Algiers and
measured 4.9 on the Richter scale, according to the National
Astronomy and Geophysics Center.
   A quake measuring about 3 on the scale was felt a little later in
Batna, a region in far eastern Algeria, the center reported.
   The Richter scale is a measure of energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake with a magnitude of 4 has the potential to
cause moderate damage, while one measuring 5 can cause considerable
damage.

<HEAD>Computer Experts Fault FBI Plan to Track Suspects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans to expand the FBI crime computer to
include tracking of suspects not charged with any crime pose serious
problems for constitutional rights, says a panel of computer
scientists.
   ``The files pose a potential threat to the privacy and civil
liberties of persons included in the files and to the civil
liberties of the public in general,'' said the report by Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility.
   The report, prepared at the request of Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., was made public Sunday. Edwards is planning to hold
hearings in March by his House Judiciary subcommittee on FBI plans
to update its crime computer.
   Edwards praised the computer organization's report and said the
``FBI should drop the tracking proposals.''
   ``They pose too many problems in terms of security, privacy and
accuracy, and it seems that the tracking proposals won't be very
useful to law enforcement anyhow,'' Edwards said in a statement.
   The tracking plan is part of larger blueprints to modernize the
FBI's National Crime Information Center, or NCIC.
   Established in 1967, the NCIC has long been a focus of
controversy involving issues of individual privacy. It consists of a
main computer at FBI headquarters plus an array of
telecommunications lines and a network of state and federal criminal
information systems.
   Through this system, data is exchanged by more than 64,000 state,
local and federal law enforcement agencies. It contains some 20
million records of wanted or missing persons, stolen property and
criminal histories.
   According to the report, the NCIC system answers 750,000
inquiries a day and works almost instantaneously. Some police
cruising in squad cars are able to query the computer through mobile
terminals, the report said.
   It said the tracking proposals were part of an ``NCIC 2000''
blueprint for updating the system, prepared for the FBI under
contract by the MITRE Corp.
   Under this plan, the FBI would track individuals not subject to
an arrest warrant but under investigation. If, for example, such a
suspect arrived in New York from abroad, the system would be
notified when he passed through Customs.
   The system itself would notify the law enforcement agency
investigating the suspect. And if, on leaving New York, he drove
south on the New Jersey Turnpike and received a ticket for speeding,
the process would be repeated.
   ``The NCIC is a valuable law enforcement tool,'' Edwards said.
``We should focus on making it better and more accurate but it
should be limited to public record information, like warrants and
stolen car reports.
   He said the agency should ``go slow in expanding the NCIC,''
adding that ``the experts who wrote this report found that the FBI
still has not addressed the accuracy and reliability problems'' that
critics say exist in the system.
   The study was prepared by three computer scientists, David D.
Redell, Peter G. Neumann and James J. Horning, along with Diana
Gordon, a professor of political science at City College of New
York, and Janlori Goldman, an attorney with the American Civil
Liberties Union's privacy and technology project.

<HEAD>Sununu Says Bush Standing With Tower, Expects Confirmation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is standing up for Defense
Secretary-designate John G. Tower and expects the Senate to confirm
his nomination and clear him of allegations about his financial and
personal affairs, White House chief of staff John Sununu said Sunday.
   ``Every single allegation that is of significance that has been
checked has produced a dry hole,'' said Sununu.
   Tower appeared headed for easy confirmation until conservative
lobbyist Paul Weyrich testified before the Senate Armed Services
Committee on Jan. 31 that he had seen the nominee intoxicated and
accompanied by women other than his wife.
   Since then, allegations have mushroomed. A confirmation vote was
delayed until at least Feb. 21 by a new allegation last week
concerning Tower's campaign finances during his 24-year career in
the Senate.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., has said that he could not vote in favor of Tower until the
allegations are cleared up. Nunn also expressed concern over Tower's
drinking.
   No date has been set for the committee to vote on the nomination.
   ``The Senate is in the process of doing about the same thing we
did before the name went up,'' Sununu said on the ABC-TV interview
program, ``This Week with David Brinkley. ``We chased down through
the FBI all those allegations.
   ``The Senate has to work its course. We understand that. That's
the right thing to do. But the President is convinced that the same
thing will happen as they go through this, that those allegations
will be proven not to have any basis and that when they do vote,
John Tower will be confirmed,'' said Sununu.
   Sununu denied that the administration had withheld from
Democratic senators material developed on Tower by the FBI.
   ``Every time the Senate has asked us for information, we have
encouraged the FBI to provide it,'' he said.
   Sununu also said he did not think Nunn was holding up the
nomination in an effort to enhance his own power.
   ``I don't think that's fair to Sam Nunn,'' said Sununu, in
response to a question. ``I've had a number of discussions, as has
the president, with the chairman, and in each and every case, I
think Sam Nunn has put forward a very sincere set of concerns and
concerns that ought to be followed to the fullest ... I think the
senator's track record proves that he care about the defense of this
country. We don't have any problems with what is going on.''
   Tower has testified that he does not have an alcohol problem, and
authorized the release of a recent hospital test showing no evidence
of alcohol abuse.
   Tower's designated spokesmen, Paul Eggers, said Tower sometimes
drank too much in the early 1970's, but ``he's not had a drinking
problem for years.''

   An earthquake shook eastern Cuba early Sunday,
Cuba's official news agency reported.
   There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries
from the quake, the Prensa Latina agency said in a dispatch from
Havana.
   The agency, which quoted the Seismic Center in Havana, said the
earthquake apparently was centered in southeastern Santiago de Cuba.
   It gave no magnitude on the Richter scale and did not say exactly
when it occurred.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said
an earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale hit off the coast of
Haiti, near eastern Cuba, early Sunday. A center spokesman said it
was probably the same quake.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 5 on the scale can cause considerable
damage.

<HEAD>Giving Chocolate On Valentine's Day More Than Romantic</HEAD>

   The romantic effect of giving someone a
heart-shaped box of chocolates on Valentine's Day could be more than
sentimental.
   ``Chocolate does have amorous value,'' said George Higgins, a
pastry chef instructor at the 8,000-student Johnson &amp; Wales
University in Providence, one of the biggest cooking schools in the
world.
   ``A chemical in the chocolate hits a pleasure center in the
brain,'' Higgins said. ``As a gift from a lover to a lover, it would
certainly help do the trick.''
   Chocolate contains phenylethylamine, or PEA, a natural
mood-altering chemical also found in the human brain.
   ``Win a lottery, get a promotion, fall in love, especially fall
in love, and your PEA level shoots up. You're optimistic, sociable,
and peppy,'' according to ``Chocolate, An Illustrated History'' by
Marcia and Fredrick Morton. ``But if things go wrong, especially if
something goes wrong in your love life, you turn listless and
depressed because your PEA level is down.''
   Cocoa butter melts at about body temperature, ``so when you put
good chocolate in your mouth it begins to melt, it becomes a sensual
thing,'' said Gayle Steinhart, of Gayle's Chocolates in Newport, in
a telephone interview from her store in Royal Oak, Mich. She said
her sales are 20 times normal on Valentine's Day and the day before.
   ``The taste of chocolate is a sensual pleasure in itself,
existing in the same world as sex,'' sex therapist Ruth Westheimer
wrote in her column, ``Ask Dr. Ruth.''
   But there's also an argument against the romantic effects of
chocolate.
   ``I really wonder whether giving chocolate for Valentine's Day is
really the best type of gift if one wants to pursue any type of
intense, romantic affair,'' said Judith Wurtman, a research
scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's department of
nutrition and food sciences. ``The high fat and the high sugar
content may make you very sleepy.''
   ``If you're dealing in a situation where the woman is being
pursued by the man, it might slow her down theoretically enough that
she can be caught,'' she added.
   Whatever the real effect of chocolate, the origins of
chocolate-giving on Valentine's Day are obscure.
   Centuries ago in Central America, chocolate was associated with
divinities and so came to represent health and well-being, according
to ``Chocolate.''
   By the 18th century, chocolate's reputation as an aphrodisiac had
spread over Europe and North America, according to ``The Language of
Sex from A to Z'' by Robert M. Goldenson and Kenneth N. Anderson. It
was ``probably the original alleged aphrodisiac of the Western
Hemisphere.''
   Or maybe chocolate and valentines have a simpler relationship.
   ``I have a feeling that sweetheart goes with sweet,'' said Lars
Johansson, director of the pastry curriculum at Johnson and Wales.
``But for us, it's just hard work because it's a commercial day.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last time two respected black politicians in
this town ran for the same office, things got downright ugly.
   That was in 1986, when civil rights movement veterans Julian Bond
and John Lewis spiked their 25-year friendship and fought each other
for the congressional seat Lewis eventually won.
   Now, Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's first black mayor, and Michael
Lomax, Fulton County Commission chairman, both want to move into
City Hall as mayor when Andrew Young moves out. Young is prohibited
by law from running for a third consecutive term.
   Lomax, who has had designs on the mayor's office for at least two
years, announced New Year's Day for the Oct. 3 non-partisan
election. Jackson, who has never ruled out another candidacy since
he left office in 1981 because of the no-third-term law, is expected
to announce his candidacy this week.
   Both insist the campaign will be polite and issue-oriented.
History shows they may be wrong, and some sniping and stunting has
already begun.
   ``We're all going to work hard and run a clean campaign,''
Jackson said in a recent interview.
   ``I don't think it'll be dirty,'' Lomax said. ``We all have to
have opponents. I don't view this with hostility.''
   Atlanta political pollster Claibourne Darden disagreed.
   ``Without question, this will be a dirty race. They always end up
that way,'' Darden said. ``They always end up calling each other
racists. You can count on that happening.
   ``This won't be an issue election; this will be a personality
election,'' Darden said.
   Lomax, 41, has served on the Fulton County Commission for 10
years, eight of them as chairman at a time when the northern part of
the county, which encompasses predominantly black central Atlanta,
has undergone an economic and population boom.
   Jackson, 50, laid plans for the expansion of the city's airport
and rail transit system. He also fought to see that a portion of the
construction work on those projects would go to minority contractors.
   In the 1986 congressional battle, Lewis demanded that Bond submit
to a drug test, and Bond accused Lewis of abandoning black voters
for the sake of white corporate interests.
   At one point, Bond said to Lewis, ``I had to wait 25 years to
find out you really don't think I amount to much.'' The men were
barely speaking to each other by the campaign's end.
   In this year's mayoral race, the issues are drugs and crime. The
niceties already are being thrown out the window:
   _ Lomax petitioned members of the Fulton County Commission to
undergo drug tests. He submitted to one himself and passed. Jackson
responded: ``If anyone wants to challenge me to a drug test, I'll
meet them on the steps of City Hall, cup in hand.''
   _ Lomax scheduled vigils at the Bankhead Courts housing project,
where various services were suspended when postal carriers and
telephone repairmen were chased away by the gunfire of drug dealers.
   Jackson showed up, and proposed eliminating the city's housing
authority and turning the projects into tenant-owned cooperatives.
He said cash rewards should be given to residents who turn in their
drug-dealing neighbors _ funds the residents could use toward the
purchase of their homes.
   _ Jackson spoke at a mid-January businessmen's luncheon in
Atlanta's ritzy Buckhead section. Lomax responded by accusing
Jackson of ``sleeping in Buckhead'' while he was ``camping out in
Bankhead.''
   _ When Lomax announced his candidacy during a New Year's Day
rally at another drug-ridden housing project, about 20 protesters,
toting placards reading ``No Lomax for Mayor,'' rained on his
parade. Some in the Lomax camp suspected Jackson forces sent them.
Protest organizer Roy Yancy said they showed up on their own.
   Jackson said Lomax's newfound populist label ``is not going to be
able to stick.''
   ``What we've got is people who view public service in different
ways,'' Jackson said. ``I think one of the things that's going to
come out of this campaign is a difference in the candidates as to
how we look at and treat people.''
   Lomax, who came from Los Angeles, said the voters may not buy
Jackson's image as a concerned native son.
   ``I understand that Atlanta is a city which has a tremendous
tradition of home-grown leadership,'' Lomax said. ``But I think the
issues have gone unaddressed in this city over the last 16 years.''

<HEAD>The Honeymoon's Over In Divided Indiana House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three months after Republicans and Democrats
in the Indiana House found themselves deadlocked at 50 members each
and pledged to cooperate, their marriage of convenience is showing
signs of strain.
   ``The honeymoon appears to be over, and the in-laws have moved
in,'' is how House Republican Speaker Paul S. Mannweiler put it
recently.
   The House became bogged down in a series of disputes after
Democrats began to exert their new power to block a 51-vote majority
and Republicans showed frustration at losing control of the chamber
for the first time in 12 years.
   ``It was strained, and there were times I think people were
frustrated,'' said Rep. Stanley G. Jones, the House Democratic floor
leader.
   Both sides in the House pledged unprecedented bipartisan
cooperation after Democrats picked up two seats in the November
election, which also made Evan Bayh the state's first Democratic
governor in 20 years, and the 100 seats split 50-50.
   After a deadlock on organization day in late November,
negotiations finished on Thanksgiving yielded a unique power-sharing
agreement.
   It called for co-speakers, one from each party presiding on
alternate days; co-chairmen of the House's 28 committees; and new
rules designed to prevent one party from holding the other party's
legislation hostage.
   It seemed to work after the session opened Jan. 4, but events in
the last couple of weeks demonstrated one party can still impose its
will on the other.
   On a day when Democratic Speaker Michael K. Phillips was
presiding, Democrats prevented a committee report on a Republican
bill from moving to the amendment stage on the House floor.
   Two days later, Democrats voted as a block to prevent a majority
and defeat 40 Republican-written amendments to a bill to create a
state lottery.
   ``I think obviously we've been shown that 50 united people can
deny 50 other people the opportunity to have input,'' said
Mannweiler.
   ``It's easy to take 50 votes and stop something. It's not so easy
to get 51 votes and enact something,'' he said.
   During the debate on the committee report, House Republican Floor
Leader Richard M. Dellinger argued that Democrats were stepping back
from a tie-vote rule they had insisted upon during November's
negotiations. That rule allows a bill to emerge from committee on a
tie vote. Previously, a bill had to have a majority vote to advance.
   Dellinger said blocking a committee report ``was like having a
red flag in front of a bull.''
   So, a few days later the lottery bill, which had been expected to
enjoy broad bipartisan support, triggered a partisan debate.
   Republicans offered a series of amendments proposing expenditures
for education and human services programs that Democrats have long
favored. That forced the Democrats to vote against the amendments in
order to preserve the lottery bill as Bayh wanted it.
   After that, Mannweiler said, ``There was some frustration that
partisanship on the part of the Democrats was spoiling what had been
a fairly even-handed system so far.''
   Jones responded that Democrats presided fairly, adding: ``There's
no question there's frustration (among the GOP). There's the same
frustration I felt as a minority member of this body.''
   Jones said he hopes Republicans would ``not get involved in tit
for tat. That serves no one, Republicans or Democrats.''
   Mannweiler said he hopes the displays of power ``will bring
seasoned minds to think there has to be a better way.''
   Other leaders were not so sure.
   ``It appears to me we are headed for a long, strange year or two
years,'' until another election gives one party a majority, said
House Republican Caucus Chairman Dan Stephan.

<HEAD>Colombian Judge Kept In Hiding In Detroit, At U.S. Expense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who fled Colombia after being threatened
by the alleged head of a major drug cartel is living in Detroit,
protected around the clock by guards paid by the United States, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   Consuelo Sanchez-Duran and her husband, Augusto, have lived in
the Detroit area since October under the protection of about 70
guards hired by the U.S. government, the Detroit News quoted
unidentified law enforcement officials as saying.
   It was unclear why federal officials chose the Detroit area as
Sanchez's hiding place, but the News said local police were
concerned that her presence could endanger her neighbors or other
people with whom she comes in contact.
   Sanchez, described by the paper as being in her 30s, fled
Colombia after issuing a murder charge against Pablo Escobar
Gaviria, who the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says is head
of the Medellin cartel, blamed for smuggling most of the cocaine
that reaches the United States. A rival cartel is based in the
Colombian city of Calli.
   The judge ordered Escobar arrested and charged with murder in the
Dec. 17, 1987, killing of Guillermo Cano, owner of the Bogota daily
newspaper El Espectador. Fifteen others also were charged.
   Escobar, who has been reported to have financed low-income
housing and parks in Medellin, has not been tried.
   Members of the organization are suspected of carrying out dozens
of murders in Latin America and the United States.
   The organization sent Sanchez a threatening letter before she
signed the arrest warrant. The letter, published in Colombian
newspapers in August, said that if she issued the warrant her entire
family, including ``ancestors and offspring,'' would be killed.
   ``We are capable of executing you anywhere on this planet,'' the
letter said. ``There is no place you can hide.''
   Officials say Escobar offered a $1 million murder contract for
Sanchez.
   In four years, drug traffickers in Colombia have killed two dozen
judges, a justice minister, an attorney general, three journalists
and scores of policemen and soldiers. The News said that in the past
seven years more than 50 Colombian judges have been killed.
   Officials told the News the U.S. State Department is paying the
estimated $15,000 weekly security and living cost from $5 million
provided by the 1988 Omnibus Drug Bill and earmarked for the
protection of Colombian jurists who indict drug dealers.
   The DEA helped Sanchez leave Colombia, flew her to Miami and
eventually brought her to Detroit, according to the newspaper.
   Because the News learned and disclosed details about Sanchez, the
government is likely to move her, the newspaper said.
   ``They're going to have to change everything now that the cat's
out of the bag, that's for sure,'' the newspaper quoted one federal
official as saying.
   Escobar also is under federal indictment in Miami on several
charges, but is able to avoid extradition because Colombia no longer
recognizes its 1977 extradition treaty with the United States.
   He was listed as a billionaire by Fortune magazine two years ago.

   Suits and sunglasses worn by Dan Aykroyd
and the late John Belushi in ``The Blues Brothers'' movie were
auctioned to raise money for the handicapped.
   The items were donated by Belushi's widow, Judy Jacklin Belushi,
for the auction held Saturday night to benefit the Ray Graham
Association for the Handicapped, based in the western Chicago suburb
of Elmhurst.
   Belushi's costume _ including shirt, tie, shoes, socks, hat and a
copy of the sunglasses he wore _ was sold for $5,211, said Michelle
Walsh, a spokeswoman for the Ray Graham association. Aykroyd's
outfit, including a pair of his prescription sunglasses, went for
$3,211, she said.
   Auction organizers Sunday were still calculating the total amount
raised, said Mary Wiermanski.
   The suits and glasses were impromptu costumes the actors chose as
their Blues Brothers skits, which graduated from pre-show
entertainment for the television program ``Saturday Night Live'' to
on-air antics, Mrs. Belushi said.
   The original suits were purchased in a New York thrift shop.
   Belushi died in March 1982 of a drug overdose.

   Comic Pinky Lee, recuperating from a major
heart attack, said he plans to change his lifestyle, but not give up
the daily dance routine he once enjoyed in the garage of his home.
   ``I have a little dance floor and a cassette player and I dance
every day,'' said Lee, 72, before he left a hospital here for his
home in Mission Viejo, Calif. ``I hoof it up.''
   Lee, a lisping, baggy-pants vaudeville veteran and early
television comedian, was stricken backstage Jan. 25 at the Peoria
Civic Center during a road-company performance of the Broadway
musical ``Sugar Babies.''
   He denies any regrets over his career, but Lee is unable to mask
the bitterness he feels over lost opportunities, failed comebacks
and his squandered fortune _ he earned a reported $150,000 a year
during his network prime.
   ``I was a rich man. I lost a fortune listening to friends and
making bad investments,'' he said. ``But we've lived a very
comfortable, happy life. Now I'm starting over. And I'm not talking
about show business. I'm talking about life. I have to change my
lifestyle if I'm going to extend my years.''

   A display of oil paintings by mass murderer John
Wayne Gacy has opened in an alternative bookstore in Boston,
sparking a protest from a member of a victims rights group.
   ``The only way they should display any of those pictures is if
the money being raised is going to the families of the children
whose life he snuffed. Otherwise they should burn (the pictures),''
said Jeanne Quinn, a member of Parents of Murdered Children.
   Gacy was convicted in 1980 of the sex-related killings of 33
young men and boys and was sentenced to die in the Illinois electric
chair. Gacy, who is appealing the death sentence, is being held at
the Menard state prison in southwestern Illinois.
   The Boston exhibit at the Primal Plunge bookstore in the city's
Allston section was arranged by Jessi Rossi, 31, who has been
writing to Gacy for more than a year and is acting as his agent to
sell the paintings.
   ``I'm interested in how he thinks,'' she told the Boston Sunday
Herald. ``In the context of what he's been convicted of, these
paintings are bound to cause quite a thrill.''
   The paintings, which Gacy is selling for between $50 and $130
each, depict clowns, dwarves, witches, Christ and death skulls.

   High-altitude winds forced a
postponement Sunday of the launch the Air Force's new Delta 2 space
rocket with an advanced navigation satellite.
   The postponement was announced just 13 minutes before the planned
liftoff after balloon data showed that shear winds several miles
above the launch pad were too high for the rocket to pass through
safely.
   ``We have scrubbed the launch of the Navstar mission because of
the upper level wind conditions,'' Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force
launch commentator reported. Wind velocities were not reported.
   The launch was rescheduled for 1:30 p.m. Tuesday.
   Rand said a two-day delay was needed to provide rest for the
launch team.
   The maiden launch of the Delta 2 is to carry into space a $65
million Navstar satellite that will enable NATO military users such
as ships, planes, trucks and tanks to locate their positions within
50 feet. The accuracy for civilian users will be 300 feet.
   The Delta 2 is a more powerful model of the Delta 1, which has
logged 170 successes in 182 launches since 1960. It is the first of
three new space boosters the Air Force ordered built to carry
national security payloads after the space shuttle Challenger
explosion in 1986.
   The grounding of the shuttle fleet and the Titan 34D rocket, also
after a 1986 failure, has left the Pentagon with a backlog of about
40 reconnaissance, communications, navigation and other military
satellites to be launched.
   The new Titan 4 rocket is scheduled to debut here next month,
with the Atlas 2 set for a 1990 maiden launch.
   The Navstar satellite, orbiting 11,000 miles up, is to join seven
earlier model Navstars already on patrol. The Air Force goal is a
constellation of 21 of the upgraded payloads in orbit by 1992 to
provide total global coverage.

   The prospect that Ferdinand Marcos may
soon die presents his successor, Corazon Aquino, with the
unpalatable decision of whether to let him return home.
   It also has led to speculation about who will lead Marcos'
followers upon his death.
   The former president has been hospitalized in Honolulu since Jan.
16 and last week suffered a relapse of pneumonia and bronchial
asthma. He remains in critical condition on a respirator in an
intensive care unit.
   Supporters of the 71-year-old Marcos say he is dying and wants to
return to the country he ruled for 20 years until he was ousted in
1986 in a popular uprising.
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly banned Marcos from returning, citing
security concerns, but she allowed a Filipino official to travel to
the United States to talk with Marcos representatives.
   The decision suggested she might consider negotiating a deal,
possibly involving the return of some of the estimated $10 billion
Marcos and his associates allegedly embezzled during his
administration.
   Because the government's position is not entirely clear, rumors
abound about an impending deal. There is lively debate among
politicians and commentators on what Mrs. Aquino should do.
   ``National interest demands that we deny him a homecoming,''
wrote the independent Philippine Daily Inquirer. ``In sum ...
Marcos, even in death, should not be allowed to return to the
Philippines.''
   But Senate President Jovito Salonga said Marcos should be allowed
to come home to die if he can settle federal racketeering charges
U.S. authorities filed against him in October.
   Even if Marcos dies abroad, the government would face the
emotional question of whether to allow him to be buried in his
native land.
   The administration has given mixed signals on the issue, and
opinion among politicians and commentators is divided.
   Last week, several Manila newspapers quoted officials as saying
the Cabinet has opted for a ``Napoleonic solution'': banning Marcos'
body from being returned to the Philippines.
   The phrase was coined by Sen. John Osmena, who recommended the
government follow the example of Napoleon. The French emperor died
in exile on St. Helena island in 1821, and his body was not returned
to France until 19 years later.
   Osmena said the government would face mass demonstrations by
Marcos' followers and left-wing extremists if Marcos' body were
brought to the Philippines. Mrs. Aquino says the matter has not been
settled.
   Forbidding a funeral here would infuriate Marcos supporters and
risk portraying Mrs. Aquino as vengeful and unforgiving, especially
since she refused Marcos' requests to return home in May after his
95-year-old mother died.
   ``Considering the fact that we Filipinos revere the dead and even
forgive their misdeeds and wrongdoings while alive, a Marcos burial
in his hometown should make Cory rise above the pettiness and
recriminations of the people around her,'' wrote independent
columnist Emil Jurado in The Manila Standard.
   On Friday, Filipino news organizations received anonymous letters
that said a coup called ``Operation Valentine'' would be staged
around Valentine's Day, Wednesday. Military officers alleged to be
part of the conspiracy included some of Mrs. Aquino's most trusted
lieutenants.
   It appeared the letters were a right-wing attempt to sow distrust
and to pressure Mrs. Aquino into acceding to Marcos' demand to
return home. She dismissed the letters as a prank.
   But military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said three
renegade officers, including former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan, met recently in secret to discuss joining forces. Honasan
led an August 1987 coup attempt in which 53 people were killed and
hundreds wounded.
   Another question raised by Marcos' poor health is who would lead
his supporters should he die.
   Several candidates have emerged, including Vice President
Salvador Laurel, who met Marcos in Hawaii this month, and Sen. Juan
Ponce Enrile, whom Mrs. Aquino fired as defense minister in 1986
after a failed coup by his followers.
   Several politicians have pointed to Eduardo Cojuangco, a wealthy
former Marcos ally who lives in California. Cojuangco is also a
cousin of Mrs. Aquino.
   ``The figure to watch is really Danding,'' said Rep. Bonifacio
Gillego, calling Cojuangco by his nickname. ``People admire him
because he did not bring his wealth out of the country and knows how
to take care of his people.''
   Former Labor Minister Blas Ople told The Manila Chronicle that
Cojuangco ``will be a serious competitor within the opposition for
use of assets if he has a mind to use them.''

how great or how small.
   Rep. Jim McCrery was called on by a constituent to deliver a plum
to then-President Reagan. He and his staff also found time to
negotiate a telephone bill revision for an elderly couple who said
emphatically that they had not dialed 976-LOVE, a sexy call-in line,
a dozen times.
   Then there was the time Rep. Billy Tauzin got a call from a woman
in Chackbay, La., his hometown.
   ``She said she had a terrible problem,'' he said. ``I guess I was
feeling real good about being a congressman, and I told her `If you
got a problem, I'll solve it.'
   ``So she said, `The garbage man hasn't been coming and the dogs
are getting into my garbage and it's a mess.' I asked her, `Did you
call the sanitation department?'
   ``She waited about three seconds and said, `Billy, I didn't know
I needed to go that high.'''

   At least 55 people were killed in the
last two days of campaigning for legislative elections, including 36
villagers massacred while they slept, officials said Sunday.
   ``It is the worst and bloodiest election campaign in Sri Lanka's
history,'' said Elmo Gooneratne, a senior government official.
   In the bloodiest attack, Tamil militants attacked the villagers
in a remote jungle of central Sri Lanka.
   Officials blamed militant Sinhalese for the other 19 slayings,
including the assassination of an opposition party candidate. He was
the 14th would-be legislator to die since campaigning for
Wednesday's elections began five weeks ago.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed since nominations for the
elections began Jan. 6.
   They will be the first parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka since
1977. A 1982 referendum doubled the normal six-year life of the
legislature elected in 1977.
   Campaigning ends midnight Sunday. Most of the 1,400 candidates
for 225 parliamentary seats spent the day addressing meetings and
making last-minute appeals for votes.
   The village massacre was perpetrated by more than 50 rebels, who
crept into the rice-farming village of Dutuwewa and attacked with
automatic rifle fire, clubs and machetes late Saturday, said a
police officer contacted by telephone in nearby Horawapatana.
   Military officials in Colombo said the 36 victims included 20
children.
   ``The rebels attacked a cluster of houses close to the jungle,''
according to the police officer, who said he was first to arrive at
the scene. ``Other villagers heard shooting and screams but were too
frightened to come out.''
   Dutuwewa is about 60 miles northeast of Colombo, the capital. The
village is in the predominantly Sinhalese North Central Province,
but lies just outside Eastern Province, a main operational area for
Tamil separatists.
   Hundreds of army commandos and police fanned out in marshy
jungles surrounding the village to search for the killers, while
helicopters made aerial surveys to prevent the rebels escaping, the
policeman said on condition of anonymity.
   A foreign ministry official in Colombo blamed the killings on the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most powerful Tamil guerrilla
group which has waged a bloody war for independence since 1983.
   The Tigers issued a statement denying responsibility.
   More than 8,500 people have died in ethnic violence as minority
Tamils press their attacks on the Sinhalese majority that dominates
the government.
   Mainly Hindu Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million
people. They claim they are discriminated against in education,
employment and culture by the majority Buddhist Sinhalese.
   In southern Sri Lanka, attackers wearing camouflage uniforms
killed Somapala Amarakeerthi of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, his
brother David, and a supporter, military officials said.
   The killings happened Saturday in Karandeniya, 37 miles south of
Colombo. Authorities blame most political killings in the south on
Sinhalese extremists of the People's Liberation Front, who have
vowed to disrupt the election. They accuse the government of making
too many concessions to the Tamils.
   Among 16 political party supporters killed in a series of attacks
across central and southern Sri Lanka were six Moslem supporters of
President Ranasinghe Premadasa's ruling United National Party
attacked while they were meeting to discuss election strategies,
officials said. The other victims were Sinhalese.

<HEAD>White House Budget Chief Says Democrats May Seek New Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House budget chief said Sunday that
Democratic members of Congress are free to propose new taxes, but
insisted that more taxes are not needed to reduce the federal
deficit.
   ``What would happen in a negotiation is that we are certainly not
going to bring up taxes,'' said Richard Darman, director of the
Office of Management and Budget. ``The president has made his
position extremely clear.
   ``If the other side wants to bring up taxes, we will have to
discuss that on the merits. And our position is that the merits
don't require taxes,'' Darman said on the CBS-TV program ``Face the
Nation.'' President Bush campaigned on a pledge not to raise taxes.
   Darman was to discuss the administration's budget proposal Monday
with the Democratic chairmen of the Senate and House budget
committees, Sen. Jim Sasser of Tennessee and Rep. Leon Panetta of
California.
   ``I look forward to learning a little bit more about what they're
thinking of as their own possible budget,'' Darman said. ``I've
noticed some things that they've said which suggest to me, meaning
no disrespect, that they perhaps have not yet fully read the book,''
a 193-page budget proposal that Bush sent Congress last Thursday.
   Bush said his proposal would leave a deficit of $91.1 billion,
well within the $100 billion required by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   The Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago, said the Bush proposal did not
spell out how the government would ease the deficit.
   ``I don't know whether we're going to increase taxes,''
Rostenkowski said on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week With David
Brinkley. ``But I do know one thing, we can't increase them without
the President of the United States.''
   Darman said many details on revenue and spending were left to be
worked out in negotiations between the Democratic Congress and the
Republican administration because ``if people take positions that
are too sharp, too partisan, too publicly, it tends to prevent the
system from coming together.''
   Proposing new taxes, said Darman, ``would be entirely up the
Democracts, but I can assure you that I am not going to bring it
up.''
   ``I would think that the Democrats, I can't advise them, but I
would think that they would not wish to be in that position. There
isn't a need,'' he said.
   ``As soon as one opens the door for taxes, then the system loses
discipline,'' said Darman. ``What we need in this system now is
discipline ... If you were suddenly to say, you know, we can duck
this whole problem by just having a little tax increase, the next
thing that happens is everybody starts saying, `Well, we'd like to
spend more on this, more on that, more on that,' and you don't cut
the deficit.''

   A comatose woman who received an abortion
after a two-week legal battle was in guarded condition Sunday as her
family explored moving her to a rehabilitation facility in New
Jersey or Boston.
   Nancy Klein, 32, was at North Shore University Hospital Sunday,
with all signs stable, a hospital spokesman said one day after Mrs.
Klein was given an abortion requested by her husband. She was 18
weeks pregnant.
   Attorneys involved in the case said the court's decision to allow
Martin Klein of Upper Brookville in Long Island to order an abortion
for his wife broke legal ground.
   ``It was a tough case because we didn't have a law to directly
point to for an answer,'' said Anthony D'Auria, an attorney for
North Shore University Hospital.
   Mrs. Klein has been in a coma since she was severely brain
damaged in a car accident Dec. 13. Martin Klein, her husband of nine
years, began court proceedings on Jan. 26 to become her guardian so
he could order an abortion doctors said could aid her recovery.
   Abortion opponents challenged Klein from local courts to the U.S.
Supreme Court, losing when Justice Thurgood Marshall refused to
issue a stay Friday. After overnight preparations, the abortion was
performed Saturday morning _ as activists still tried to find a
legal way to stop it.
   Mrs. Klein will remain in the hospital while her husband and
other family members research a rehabilitation facility where she
can be placed. Under consideration are places in New Jersey near
where Klein's sister lives and one in the Boston area, family
members said.
   ``I couldn't bear to be that far away from Nancy,'' Klein said
last week.
   One of the reasons Klein sought the abortion, he said, is that
some rehabilitation facilities would not accept a pregnant woman.
   After the abortion was announced, anti-abortion activist John
Short vowed to press the appeal with the full Supreme Court, even
though it is moot, to set a precedent so similar cases would not
occur.
   But the ruling may have dealt a blow to opponents who have
attempted to intervene in cases where they apparently have no
clear-cut interest legally, some lawyers said.
   ``One of the important aspects of this case is that it is the
first time a court has squarely said to these pro-life groups: It is
inappropriate to interfere in the private decisions of a family,''
said Elizabeth Bradford, an assistant state attorney general whose
office was called in to take part in the proceedings.
   A New York state appeals court, in dismissing an appeal from
Short and John Broderick, another activist, called them ``absolute
strangers'' who, ``whatever their motivation, have no place in the
midst of a family tragedy.''
   ``The importance of this case is that it establishes that the
next of kin need only prove that the patient is incapable of forming
an opinion or granting consent,'' said D'Auria. ``Under this ruling,
it would be no longer necessary in the state for courts to weigh the
relative risks or advantages, or even necessity, of an abortion.''
   In issuing the first ruling in the case, Nassau County state
Supreme Court Justice Bernard McCaffrey rejected the contention that
this was a decision where there had to be clear and convincing
evidence of what the woman's wishes would have been, before an
abortion could be performed. In New York state, the Supreme Court is
a trial-level court.
   D'Auria said that father's rights also may have been furthered by
the case.
   ``This case has marked a slight departure from previous existing
law that stated that fathers do not have the right to determine
whether a woman should have an abortion,'' D'Auria said.

<TEXT>
   Nearly all Americans are aware of the crisis in
the nation's savings and loan industry but only a small fraction are
withdrawing their money, according to a poll released Sunday by ABC
News.
   The telephone poll of 509 adults, conducted Feb. 8-9, found that
84 percent were aware of the crisis and that 49 percent had savings
accounts in S&amp;L institutions.
   Of those with S&amp;L accounts, it said, 6 percent were planning to
withdraw their money because of the crisis, and 4 percent had
withdrawn money from an S&amp;L within the last few months.
   Thirty-nine percent of those polled predicted they would be
affected eventually by the problems besetting savings and loan
institutions.
   A majority, 56 percent, said they approved in general of a plan
by President Bush to bail out the S&amp;Ls by selling bonds to
supplement the federal insurance program that guarantees deposits in
the instititions. Thirty-seven percent said they did not like Bush's
plan.
   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent, ABC
said in a release.

<HEAD>Lebanese Boy's Vision Of Peace Wins International Poster Contest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI PRASSO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese boy growing up amid the rubble of
Beirut has known little but war in his 14 years, but his vision of
peace has been singled out in an international poster contest.
   The rendering of a dove emerging through shades of blue over a
blooming red rose, drawn by Mustafa Mustafa Tahoukji, captured the
theme of the contest, ``Peace will help us grow,'' said Charles
Stuckey, curator of 20th-century painting and sculpture at the Art
Institute of Chicago and one of five judges.
   ``It just came as a stunner when we found out the winning poster
came from a child who was witnessing the nightmarish reality that
one associates with Lebanon for the last decade,'' Stuckey said
Saturday.
   Tahoukji will receive $500 and a trip to the United Nations with
his family to receive an award March 13, Cannon said.
   The Lions Club tried to call an affiliate in Lebanon so officials
there could tell the boy the good news, but the language barrier
prevented much exchange, said Patrick Cannon, spokesman for the Oak
Park-based Lions Club. Lions officials planned to send a telex to
Lebanon with more detailed information, but Cannon said the boy
still may not have learned that his entry won.
   The contest, sponsored by Lions Club International, examined
entries from nearly 100,000 children in 49 countries.
   The 24 finalists' posters and Tahoukji's winning entry, unveiled
Friday, are on display at the Art Institute through Feb. 28. The
finalists will receive $100 and a certificate, Cannon said.
   It was the simplicity of the boy's poster, the shape of the
dove's body, and the expression on its face that persuaded the
judges to choose it over more abstract representations of peace.
   ``It's a difficult form of art because when one wants to reduce
things down to essentials ... the risk is a one-liner,'' Stuckey
said. ``He made it more complicated without throwing away the
simplicity.''
   The contest was designed to give young people an opportunity to
think about peace and ``express it visually using their emotions and
their talents,'' said Cannon.
   Many of the posters featured similar themes, which Stuckey
attributes to the innocence of the participants _ ages 10 through 14
_ and increased communication among nations.
   ``There's something so uniform about the designs,'' he said. ``If
this were done 30 years ago, I would think it would be really rather
obvious that these were coming from different parts of the world.''
   ``Obviously, doves were a common image, but another from Finland
had a forest of trees growing in the night,'' he said.

   A U.N. plan to airlift emergency
supplies to Afghanistan was suspended after a second airline pulled
out of the program, and it may be canceled, officials said Sunday.
   An Ethiopian airliner that made one flight to Kabul last week and
unloaded 32 tons of wheat refused to go again, said Sadruddin Aga
Khan, coordinator of the U.N. Office of Economic and Humanitarian
Assistance to Afghanistan.
   The pilot of the Boeing 707 ``received instructions from (the
Ethiopian government) that he should not proceed to Kabul'' again,
Aga Khan told a news conference in the Pakistani capital.
   The instructions came as the crew prepared for their second
emergency airlift Saturday, he said, adding, ``I'm not able to say
if or when the next flight will be.''
   Early last week, Egypt Air refused to fly into Kabul, claiming
security at the airport was inadequate. Ethiopia Airlines then
agreed to ferry the supplies.
   Aga Khan said he was trying to find out why the Ethiopians pulled
out of the project.
   ``I cannot speculate or extrapolate, (but) some people may be
getting cold feet,'' he said. The United Nations, he said, tried to
keep a ``cool head and warm heart without getting cold feet.''
   The airlift, originally expected to supply Kabul with 360 tons of
food, medicine and blankets over two weeks, may be cancelled, he
said.
   ``Time is running out,'' Aga Khan said.
   The United Nations had hoped to finish the airlift before Feb.
15, when the last of the Soviet Army is to be out of Afghanistan.
   Kabul has been hit by severe food and fuel shortages because of
the bitter winter weather and blockades by Moslem rebels, who have
been fighting the Soviet-backed government the past 10 years.
   Aga Khan said U.N. workers in the Afghan capital identified more
than 30,000 people, mostly women, children and elderly, who were
desperate for help.
   ``I've never seen a man in uniform starve,'' said Aga Khan.
   Moscow has been ferrying food into the capital also.
   Aga Khan also said Sunday he has raised only $888 million of the
$1.1 billion he needs for his ``Operation Salam'' project, which is
designed to help Afganistan's returning war refugees.
   Aga Khan said only 10 percent of what has been raised is in cash,
and the rest is goods.

   Relatives of black prisoners
staging a hunger strike prayed and wept Sunday at a church service
held to support the strikers' demands for freedom.
   The service took place at Anglican church in the black township
of New Brighton a day after the government banned all public
gatherings intended to show solidarity with the detainees.
   The service proceeded without interruption and there was no sign
of security forces.
   About 300 detainees are involved in the hunger strike, including
105 at St. Albans prison in Port Elizabeth and about 170 at
Diepkloof Prison outside Johannesburg. Some of the prisoners have
not eaten for 21 days, and lawyers say at least 13 of the Diepkloof
hunger strikers have been hospitalized.
   Many of the detainees at St. Albans have been held without charge
since mid-1986. They include several prominent anti-apartheid
leaders who helped organize an effective black consumer boycott in
1985-86.
   In New Brighton, a township bordering Port Elizabeth, about 400
people packed into St. Stephens Church for the solidarity service.
   One of the organizers read a statement from the detainees which
said: ``We wish to point out to our parents, wives, children and
friends that we will not stop until we are home and free. Any
attempt to stop us will fail.''
   A civil rights lawyer, M.D. Vabaza, said he visited hunger
strikes at St. Albans on Saturday and was told told that two of the
detainees had collapsed in their cells, been taken to a hospital for
treatment and then returned to the prison.
   The service was led by black and white clergymen, and the crowd
included several dozen whites as well as relatives of detainees from
throughout the region.
   The names of all the hunger strikers were read aloud during the
service, which ended with the singing of ``God Bless Africa,'' the
anthem of the anti-apartheid movement.

   A bomb exploded outside Cologne
University during a demonstration by Iranian exiles and slightly
injured two passers-by, police said Sunday.
   Authorities suspect a link between the Saturday night blast and a
demonstration inside a nearby university hall by about 2,000 Iranian
exiles protesting the 10th anniversary of the Islamic revolution,
said police spokesman Alfons Selt.
   ``Someone could have been killed if the device went off later, as
people were leaving the assembly hall,'' he said in an interview.
   The Iranian Moslem Students' Union, a group of exiles opposed to
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution, accused the
Iranian Embassy in Bonn of planting the bomb.
   In a statement, the organization claimed the embassy is used as
``a main center for the coordination of criminal terrorist acts'' in
Europe.
   Selt said two different people claimed responsibility for the
blast in telephone calls to police.
   ``One of them said he wanted to destroy opponents of the Iranian
revolution,'' Selt said.
   Two passers-by _ a 13-year-old boy and a woman _ were slightly
hurt by the bomb, which exploded as they walked past the
university's main gate, Selt said.

<HEAD>Trucks Ran Out Of Water Fighting Fire That Killed Eight</HEAD>

   Volunteer firemen ran out of water fighting
a house fire that killed eight people, and had to refill the water
tanks on their trucks five miles away, authorities said.
   But officials said the fire spread so fast that more water
probably would not have saved the lives of the eight family members
who died in the blaze early Saturday.
   ``I don't think water would have made much of a difference as far
as lives,'' said Deputy Forrest Brewster of the sheriff's office.
   ``The roof had already caved in when I got there at 3:40 a.m.,''
Brewster said. ``It was engulfed in flames. There wasn't any sounds
coming from inside there then.''
   J.B. Gibbs, who is in his 50s, and his daughter Angela, in her
20s, escaped. His wife, six of their children and a 2-year-old
granddaughter were found dead in their beds in two bedrooms _ five
in one and three in the other.
   Gibbs was awakened by the fire and tried to wake his wife,
Bernice, ``but she wouldn't move,'' said Woodruff County Sheriff
Leon Creasey.
   ``He was hysterical,'' the sheriff said.
   The fire, which authorities believe started from a crack in the
chimney attached to a wood-burning stove used to heat the house, was
reported by neighbors just after 3 a.m..
   Brewster said the four 500-gallon trucks from three volunteer
fire departments responding to the blaze made five or more trips to
fire hydrants in the Grays community, five miles away, to fill up
their tanks.
   The home in Revels, about 60 miles northeast of Little Rock, was
due to be connected to the public water supply in the spring, but
was still relying on well water along with other homes in the rural
community, according to Woodruff County Judge John Davis.
   Creasey identified the dead members of the Gibbs' family as
Bernice, 46; Audrey, 25; Shirley, 30; Kartarla, 18; Belisha 14;
John, 15; J.B., 22; and Cortney Gibbs, 2, daughter of Audrey Gibbs.

   The special prosecutor for the Iran-Contra
affair credits the press with exposing the case and opening it to
public scrutiny even if security blocks his case against former
White House aide Oliver North fails.
   ``There are two ways of enforcing the law,'' special prosecutor
Lawrence Walsh told a group of Oklahoma broadcasters Saturday night.
``One is the old way of prosecution, which is long, expensive,
cumbersome and sometimes has unforeseeable results.
   ``And the other way is by exposure and education, and that is
what your profession does so well.''
   Walsh, an Oklahoma City lawyer, was in Tulsa to be honored by the
Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters.
   The chief justice of the Supreme Court on Sunday ordered a delay
in the start of North's trial to give the full court a chance to
consider a dispute over the possible disclosure of national secrets.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell had ordered the trial to
begin Monday, but Justice Department attorneys asked the high court
for the delay based on claims that North could release highly
classified documents during his defense.
   Walsh praised the media for its coverage of the Iran-Contra
affair and the events leading up to the North trial, saying he was
surprised how accurate the media reports were about information he
later obtained in his own investigation.
   ``For six months, I got more out of the papers than I did from my
entire staff,'' he said.
   But he said the irony of a strong, effective press is evident in
the administration's request to forbid use of certain classified
documents by North in his defense.
   ``The commitment to a public trial leads to the sometimes very
difficult choices of whether certain information can be used at
trial or whether certain charges must be dropped,'' he said.
   Walsh, 77, said he believes the trial should continue without
further limitations placed on use of evidence, which could lead to
the dismissal of some or all charges against North if he is not
allowed to use the information to defend himself.
   ``It's important to see if we can apply the law to all people,
all levels of government, and to all activities, whether they are
open or secret; and at the same time, preserve our obligation for a
public trial,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh, a former president of the American Bar Association, was
appointed special prosecutor Dec. 19, 1986, by a panel of three
federal judges.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Confident POW Mission Will be Successful</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. congressman who helped launch
balloons bearing offers of a $2.4 million reward for the release of
American prisoners of war said Sunday he is confident the balloons
will reach Vietnam and Laos.
   William Hendon, 44, said he and relatives of three American
servicemen missing from the war released 600 to 700 balloons from a
trawler 40 miles south of Hong Kong and 375 miles off the Vietnamese
coast over the weekend.
   ``Our balloons will stay up 36 hours and I feel confident some
will land in Laos and Vietnam,'' Hendon said in an interview.
   Each helium-filled balloon carries a message in Vietnamese and
Laotian offering the reward in cash or gold to anyone who turns over
to U.S. custody one or more American prisoners of war.
   Hendon, a two-term Republican congressman from North Carolina
defeated in 1986, said his POW Publicity Fund is convinced U.S.
servicemen still are being held captive in the two countries, 14
years after the conflict ended.
   The U.S. government says it has been unable to prove that any of
the 2,383 Americans listed as missing in action are held prisoner,
but it says the possibility cannot be discounted, and investigations
continue.
   Vietnam and Laos deny holding U.S. servicemen.
   Hendon's group was formed by families of the missing men and
others to advertise the reward pledged mostly by 21 members of
Congress.
   The former congressman was accompanied by Elizabeth Stewart of
Washington and Bobby Bischoff of Wilson, N.C., whose fathers are
among missing U.S. servicemen, and Jeffrey Donahue of Cocoa Beach,
Fla., whose brother is missing.

   The first Episcopal woman bishop preached a Sunday
sermon that mixed evangelical zeal with a call to social activism,
saying that if Episcopal Church leaders had faltered amid
controversy she would not have been consecrated.
   ``We live in a word that oppresses, that dehumanizes, that is
replete with injustices and exploitation, a world God did not
intend,'' said Bishop Barbara C. Harris in a sermon at the Cathedral
Church of Saint Paul.
   ``If Jesus had not taken risks, we would not be saved,'' Harris
said a day after her consecration drew worldwide attention. ``If the
diocese of Massachusetts had decided to play it safe, I would not be
here wearing a brochet and a chimere and a pectoral cross.''
   She received a standing ovation from most of the 400 worshipers,
but one Tampa, Fla., couple left the church with the wife in tears,
saying she was ``heartbroken'' by Harris' consecration. The couple
declined to give their name.
   In a sermon that discussed the temptation of Christ in a modern
context, Harris called on the congregation to resist the temptation
to shut their eyes to issues such as racism and AIDS.
   ``Under the guise of tradition and convention, we temporize with
oppression and compromise with injustice,'' she said. ``We avoid the
problem and the responsibility for becoming involved, and we
rationalize to ourselves, `There's no harm in walking with the devil
as long as he's going your way.'''
   The mood was upbeat in the church.
   ``I felt like I was out of my body,'' said Delois Ward, who came
from Philadelphia to watch her friend of 15 years be consecrated
this weekend. ``It was like the dream I didn't dare dream had come
true.''
   Also at the sermon was Florence Tim-Oi Li, the first woman ever
to be ordained as an Episcopal priest. Li was ordained in 1944 in
war-torn China so she could give communion to those in Macao while
the city was under Japanese siege. But two years later, under
pressure from other Anglican churches, she agreed not to continue
being a practicing priest though she did not renounce her ordination.
   ``I am very, very happy,'' said Li, now 81 and living in Toronto.
``I am yellow. She is black. It breaks down the barriers. ... God
creates boys and girls, two sexes. Now this makes God's will
realized.''
   Ward predicted that the new bishop's warmth would sustain her.
   As Harris entered the church Sunday morning, Ward said, ``I said
to her, `Come here, let me kiss the bishop's ring.' And she said,
`Forget the ring, sweetie, kiss the bishop!'''

   Generally light snow was scattered around the Great Lakes and in
parts of the West on Sunday, with light rain in the southern Plains.
   Oakland, Calif., cooled to a record 40 degrees early Sunday.
Elsewhere around the nation, the coldest spots went down only to 1
degree below zero.
   Wind picked up moisture from Lake Ontario and produced ``lake
effect'' snow across northern New York state. Snow also fell in
Upper Michigan and central New York state.
   Snow showers extended from southern Idaho across northern Nevada,
Utah, eastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming, and from
northwestern Kansas into south-central Nebraska.
   Rain fell from northern and western Oklahoma across the northern

Coast.
   The heaviest snowfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST was 2
inches at Grand Junction, Colo., and 1 inch at Salt Lake City;
Syracuse, N.Y.; and Mount Washington, N.H.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 12
degrees at Lander and Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 73 at West
Palm Beach, Fla. Sunday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 1
degree below zero at Belgrade and Bozeman, Mont.; Burns, Ore.; and
St. Cloud, Minn.
   For Monday, snow showers were forecast in the Rockies, with snow
also falling in Upper Michigan, Wisconsin, northern Illinois and
much of the upper Mississippi Valley. Rain was forecast from the
remainder of the Great Lakes across the Appalachians, the Ohio
Valley and the Tennessee Valley. Rain with occasional thundershowers
was forecast from Missouri across Arkansas, much of Louisiana,
eastern Oklahoma and northeastern Texas.
   Highs in the teens and 20s were predicted from the northwestern
two-thirds of Minnesota across the Dakotas, the upper Missouri
Valley and the northern Rockies, as well as northern New England; in
the 30s and 40s from central New England across North Carolina, in
the northern half of the Appalachians, the Great Lakes, from Ohio
across Illinois and Wisconsin, from the southeastern third of
Minnesota across central Missouri, in the central Plains, the
central and southern Rockies, the Great Basin and the northern

<HEAD>EEC Foreign Ministers Urge Middle East Peace Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of France, Greece and
Spain on Sunday said their Middle East tour demonstrates the
European Community's decision to take a more active role in bringing
peace to the region.
   During a press conference at the end of a seven-hour visit to
Cairo, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said
that despite all efforts, he could not predict that 1989 could see
the start of the peace process.
   Fernandez Ordonez, accompanied by Greek Foreign Minister Carolos
Papoulias and their French counterpart, Roland Dumas, met earlier
with President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid. They flew in from Jordan Sunday morning and flew on to
Syria after their press conference.
   The three ministers were designated by the European Community's
Council of Ministers to explore peace possibilities in the Middle
East.
   Fernandez Ordonez said the EEC has adopted a new attitude toward
the Middle East peace process, and he said the new policy includes
``the decision to move from a level of declaration to a level of
active involvement. This visit to Egypt takes place within a
framework of contacts with all parties concerned.
   ``We emphasize the necessity of the early convening of an
international peace conference ... we have three objectives: first,
to exchange points of view with the main parties in the conflict.
Second, to contribute to push forward the peace process, and third,
to assess the situation in order to consider further steps to be
taken eventually.''
   Fernandez Ordonez said both the EEC and Egypt believed that the
early convening of an international peace conference was the best
way to bring peace to the region.
   He said his delegation would present a report to the EEC's
Council of Ministers in Madrid on Tuesday.
   The Spanish Foreign Minister said that during earlier
consultations in Israel and with Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat, the delegation had felt a positive change in
the attitude of the Israeli people toward peace.
   Fernandez Ordonez said the EEC would do all it could to try to
persuade Israel to join an international peace conference, which the
Jewish state has rejected. It prefers direct negotiations with a
joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.

<HEAD>Hospital Sues To Dishcharge Elderly Woman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital has filed suit to evict a
70-year-old patient who refuses to be discharged in a dispute over
whether she needs medical attention after more than 13 months there.
   ``I have serious questions about the way they are handling this
discharge,'' Joseph Olimpi, manager of the Elderly Law Project of
Neighborhood Legal Services, said of West Penn Hospital.
   ``I don't think anybody can order her to go anyplace she doesn't
want to go since she has been judged competent,'' he said.
   Olimpi told the hospital he will represent the patient, Eleanor
Cosentino, in the dispute.
   West Penn's lawsuit, filed Friday in Allegheny County Court,
claims Miss Cosentino no longer needs medical attention, said
hospital attorney Jerry Fedele. The hospital is trying to force her
to be transferred to a county nuring home, to her home or to a
relative's home.
   Fedele said the hospital will ask the court on Monday to set a
date for a hearing in the dispute. The hospital is seeking a court
order to discharge the woman.
   The state Medicaid program paid much of Miss Cosentino's $250,000
hospital bill. West Penn officials say $90,000 in care has been
provided for free since Medicaid discontinued payments in September.
Medicaid acted because West Penn said the woman no longer needed
hospital care.
   The woman and her family claim she needs continuing medical
attention because of recurring infections.
   Miss Cosentino has been a patient at West Penn continuously since
Christmas Day 1987. She was admitted complaining of fever and chills.
   For all but a few days of her stay, Miss Cosentino has been
isolated from other patients because of recurring staph infections
which her doctor, Alejandro Gonzalez, says she got at the hospital.
   Gonzalez says Miss Cosentino is clear of active infection and
would receive adequate care at the nursing home. By refusing to
leave, she is denying scarce hospital space to people who are ill,
he said.
   Miss Cosentino and her family question why she remains in
isolation, where she was as late as Friday night, if West Penn
doctors are correct when they say she is no longer contagious.
   The family also contends doctors treated the infections with an
antibiotic to which Miss Cosentino is allergic.
   The hospital's lawsuit claims Miss Cosentino originally agreed to
be discharged, but changed her mind on the advice of her relatives.

   Martha Mitchell, as played by Estelle Parsons in
``The Unguided Missile,'' is a quirky, opinionated woman far
shrewder than her husband, John Mitchell, at foreseeing the
post-Watergate downfall.
   Miss Parsons does a formidable job. She has the look of Martha
Mitchell, in a floral dress with a superfluous ruffle, the stridency
and the Southern accent.
   Through it all comes a woman of charm, warmth, spirit and brains,
a free spirit believing it's a free country.
   In the play by David Wolpe, which opened Sunday at the
off-Broadway American Place Theater, Mrs. Mitchell does such
uncharming things as get drunk and rant that liberals should be run
out of the country.
   She also discerns post-Watergate events shrewdly while her
husband, the attorney general. Thinking himself vastly smarter than
his wife, he tells her that he'll be loyal to President Nixon and
that the president will protect him.
   Her husband calls her a bigot, says he loves her for it and calls
her an unguided missile because of her unpredictability.
   Jerome Dempsey, playing Mitchell, is convincing when he is
proclaiming love for and frustration with his wife. He's less
convincing when he proclaims how powerful he is, seeming more at
home in a later scene where he admits that he was summoned to the
White House but kept sitting around and never met with the president.
   The play begins the day of the Watergate break-in in 1972, with
Mrs. Mitchell kept a prisoner in her home by a man who says he's
FBI. He gives her pills and drinks, has a doctor give her a shot and
keeps her away from the phone. When Mitchell returns home five days
later, one hand is bandaged and the other arm in a sling.
   Later, she tells reporters she has proof the president ordered
the break-in, while her husband is testifying that he didn't even
tell the president about it. An angry Mitchell tells her that even
her daughter hates her.
   In a final scene, in a hospital bed, Mrs. Mitchell blithely
relies on the reporter she often telephoned at night (Lezlie Dalton)
to do something about her money having run out.
   One is left less with an analysis of political events than with a
multi-faceted portrait of a woman at a time of crisis. Miss Parsons'
portrayal gains a viewer's sympathy and even respect for Martha
Mitchell.
   The play was commissioned in 1984 and has since been rewritten.
It is being performed more than 12 years after Martha Mitchell's
death. Mitchell died last fall.
   Fred Kolo directed. Holger designed the set and lighting, and
Matthew Heineman designed what is seen on TV monitors above the
stage. Nick Searcy, Barry Cullison and Mary Jo Salerno all play
several minor characters.

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan on
Sunday denied Afghanistan's charge that her army is preparing to
invade that country, saying Pakistan has enough problems of its own
without ``foreign adventures.''
   Ms. Bhutto stopped short of ruling out an eventual confederation
with Afghanistan after Moscow withdraws the last of the Soviet
troops, which have been backing the government of Afghan President
Najib in its war with Moslem guerrillas.
   ``Let's see what the Afghan people decide for themselves,'' Ms.
Bhutto told a news conference on the second day of a visit intended
mainly to emphasize Chinese-Pakistani ties.
   Najib, who uses only one name, alleged Saturday that Pakistan was
massing troops along their common border in preparation for an
invasion. He accused Afghan guerrillas of having agreed to link the
country in a confederation with Pakistan in return for Pakistani
arms and money.
   Ms. Bhutto denied Pakistan was moving troops to the border and
said it would be naive for Pakistan to try to annex Afghanistan.
   ``We've got enough problems of national integration,'' she said.
``We don't need foreign adventures.''
   ``People sometimes propose a confederation with one neighbor or
another,'' she added. ``Stray ideas like this ... may have come up
in the past in relation to Afghanistan. I do not know because they
have not gathered the weight to be considered by anybody.''
   She said Najib made his accusations ``in a bid to divert
attention from the real problems'' he faces.
   In Pakistan, both the foreign and defense ministries called
Najib's allegations ``preposterous.''
   Ms. Bhutto, on her first official trip abroad since her election
in November, met for 3{ hours Sunday morning with Premier Li Peng
and had lunch with former Chinese President Li Xiannian.
   She was scheduled to meet in Shanghai on Monday with senior
leader Deng Xiaoping. The 84-year-old Deng has been in Shanghai for
several weeks, and there are rumors he is undergoing medical
treatment.
   Ms. Bhutto, who arrived in Beijing on Saturday, said the talks
with Li were useful and productive and ``enabled us to establish a
rapport.''
   They covered bilateral ties, international affairs, the two
countries' economies, trade and communications, she said, adding,
``We agreed on everything.''
   Asked about a Pakistani newspaper report that Pakistan has agreed
to buy 75 more fighter jets from China, Ms. Bhutto said only that
she did not discuss planes with the Chinese. Pakistan long has
bought most of its planes and tanks from China.
   Ms. Bhutto said officials of the two countries signed agreements
to encourage and protect mutual investment and extend a trade
protocol to 1990.
   Xinhua said she invited Li to visit Pakistan and he responded
that he'd like to visit this year.
   China and Pakistan have had close ties since 1950, when they
established diplomatic relations.

<HEAD>Brown Returns To Politics In Election As State Chair</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Jerry Brown, a two-time
Democratic presidential hopeful, says it feels good to be back in
politics after ending six years of self-imposed political exile with
election to a party job.
   ``It feels very good. It feels great. It's been six years, but it
feels like six months,'' Brown told reporters after he won the
chairmanship of the California Democratic Party.
   He defeated investment banker Steve Westly, a longtime volunteer
unknown outside of party circles, by 1,591 votes to 777 in balloting
late Saturday among delegates to the state party's annual convention.
   Brown, who dropped out of public view after ending his eight-year
tenure as governor ended in a losing race for the U.S. Senate to
Republican Pete Wilson in 1982, described the race for the unpaid
party post as his re-entry into politics. He said he hopes to run
for other, unspecified public offices in the future.
   But the 50-year-old two-term governor, who launched his first
presidential campaign at age 36, pledged that he would devote
himself to rebuilding the California Democratic Party and wouldn't
seek any other public office during his four-year term as state
party chairman.
   Saturday's vote was Brown's first election victory in over a
decade. Since winning his second term as governor in 1978, he lost a
series of presidential primaries in 1980 and then was defeated for
the Senate in 1982.
   Asked by reporters if he might run for president or the U.S.
Senate again someday, Brown replied that ``those are the kinds of
intentions that lie deep in one's heart.''
   Westly had argued that Brown would be ``a lightning rod for
political criticism,'' breathing new life into Republican attacks
against controversial events of Brown's tenure as governor, such as
his appointment of unpopular former Chief Justice Rose Bird.
   Other critics said Brown's notoriously chaotic administrative
style didn't suit the detail-oriented duties of a state chairman,
and questioned Brown's new interest in a formal party structure that
he frequently shunned or ridiculed as irrelevant when he was
governor.
   Brown acknowledged all of those criticisms, alternately joking
about his reputation and seriously promising that he has reflected
on both his successes and failure during the six years he has spent
out of the public eye writing, meditating and traveling around the
world.
   ``I can become the media dark hole that absorbs all the negative
feedback and allows our candidate for governor to go on to victory
unscathed,'' Brown said in an acceptance speech.
   Brown said he is seriously devoted to ``the nuts and bolts of
party work,'' laying out an agenda that ranged from redefining
Democratic constituencies to operational goals ranging from the
revival of nearly dormant local Democratic clubs which thrived in
California in the 1950s to new technologies in communications and
fundraising.

   Pravda told its Soviet readers on Sunday that NATO
believes the East Bloc economies are doing so poorly that they will
fall further behind the West for another two decades.
   In a short answer to a reader's question, the official Communist
Party newspaper said Voice of America did not lie when it reported
the pessimistic economic projections given by NATO official Henning
Waggoner.
   But Pravda said the conclusions in the report were ``on
Waggoner's conscience.''
   Pravda summarized the NATO report, saying it projected no more
than 2 percent economic growth per year and a widening economic gap
between East and West until well into the next century.
   ``The system's deficiencies are so obvious that (the Soviet
Union) has no choice but to continue reforms. This significantly
reduces its opportunities to use national funds for military
affairs,'' Pravda said in explaining Waggoner's stand.
   Pravda said the official recommended against any Western aid to
the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal Joachim Meisner on Sunday
officially took over leadership of the powerful Cologne archdiocese
as thousands of protesters rallied against the Vatican's strict
stand on birth control.
   Meisner's appointment and the Pope John Paul II's conservative
policies have caused a widening rift between West Germany's Roman
Catholics and the Vatican in recent months.
   Several thousand people jammed the square outside the massive
Cologne cathedral. One group held up a banner that read ``End the
Papal Dictatorship'' as Meisner arrived by limousine for a Mass
marking the assumption of his duties.
   Other signs welcomed the new archbishop and he was given a
standing ovation when he entered the packed church.
   The hourlong ceremony was broadcast live by the national ARD
television network.
   Cologne church leaders were angered last year when the pope
insisted on the appointment of Meisner, an East German who was
previously bishop of Berlin.
   Many Cologne church leaders felt Meisner was too conservative and
expressed displeasure that their wishes were not considered in
naming a replacement for the late Cardinal Joseph Hoeffner, who died
in October 1987.
   The Cologne archdiocese is one of the most influential in Western
Europe and one of the richest in the world.
   The delay in a new appointment also led to a clash between state
leaders and the Vatican. Under a 1929 agreement, local clerics and
governments are given a say in the selection process.
   In his sermon to the congregation on Sunday, Meisner sought
reconciliation with those who opposed his appointment, but also
clearly reaffirmed a conservative course that goes to the heart of
divisions between West German Catholics and the pope's policies.
   ``My hand is outstretched to all for whom I carry
responsibility,'' Meisner said. ``I ask all to return this gesture
so that we may work together to fulfill the Lord's task.''
   But Meisner also warned against the perils of adopting secular
impulses and straying from church teachings.
   ``The task of the church is not to align itself to the (changing)
spirit of the times,'' Meisner said.
   Referring to the controversy over his appointment, Meisner said:
``Continued public assignment of blame on this or other addresses
will not serve the future path of the Cologne church.''
   The issue of Meisner's appointment has become part of a larger
dispute in West Germany over Vatican policies in recent months.
   In late January, a group of 170 Roman Catholic theologians
released a declaration strongly criticizing John Paul II and the
church ban on artificial birth control.
   The document, called the Cologne Declaration, complained that the
pope recently has linked the church's teachings on birth control too
closely to fundamental articles of faith such as the holiness of God.

<TEXT>
   Soviet soldiers on Sunday handed over
their last outpost as they prepared to return home and leave the
Afghan army to defend the capital against Moslem guerrillas.
   The Soviet-backed Afghan government, meanwhile, renewed its offer
to negotiate with the guerrillas, whose moderate and hardline
fundamentalist factions remained divided over how to form an interim
government.
   During a heavy snowstorm Sunday, Soviet troops turned over their
last combat outpost, on the edge of Kabul airport.
   Afghan soldiers raised their nation's red, black and green flag,
and Soviet and Afghan troops cheered as the changeover was completed.
   The Afghans arrived with luggage, blankets and other personal
belongings as well as automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.
   The airport, the capital's key link to the outside world, has
been a frequent target of guerrilla rocket attacks but has not been
hit in more than a month.
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said that weather permitting,
the remaining 300 Soviet soldiers in Kabul would leave Tuesday, a
day ahead of the deadline set by a U.N.-sponsored accord to end nine
years of Soviet intervention.
   The last soldiers were guarding Kabul airport while the Soviets
completed a food airlift to the capital which the guerrillas,
supported by the United States, Pakistan and China, are expected to
besiege when the Red Army is gone.
   A U.N. airlift of food, medicine and blankets was suspended
Sunday after Ethiopia pulled out of the program, officials said.
   An Ethiopian airliner made one flight to Kabul, unloaded 32 tons
of wheat and refused to return to the city, said Sadruddin Aga Khan,
coordinator of the U.N. Office of Economic and Humanitarian
Assistance to Afghanistan.
   ``I'm not able to say if or when the next flight will be,'' Aga
Khan said at a news conference in Islamabad, Pakistan.
   The guerrillas have been fighting the government in a civil war
that began in 1978 when the communists seized power in a coup.
   On Saturday, Afghan President Najib accused Pakistan of massing
troops along the border to invade and then annex Afghanistan.
   Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Sunday dismissed the
allegation, saying her nation had enough problems of its own without
``foreign adventures.''
   ``Let's see what the Afghan people decide for themselves,'' Ms.
Bhutto told a news conference in Beijing on the second day of a
visit to China.
   At a briefing Sunday, Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad
Nabi Amani said a government declaration renewed a 2-year-old offer
to negotiate with guerrilla commanders inside Afghanistan.
   ``All countries are using Afghanistan for their own benefit. We
ask them (the guerrillas) not to be tools of others but to bring
peace to the homeland and to help end the bloodshed,'' Amani said.
   More than 1 million people have died in the war and hundreds of
thousands have fled to Iran and Pakistan.
   In Islamabad, the leader of a moderate Afghan guerrilla faction
warned Sunday it may boycott talks on forming an interim government
because of disputes with fundamentalists over including Iran-based
Shiite guerrillas. The Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance is mainly
Sunni Moslem.
   Zabihullah Mojaddidi, secretary-general of the Afghan National
Liberation Front, charged that hardline fundamentalists within the
guerrilla alliance were plotting to discredit moderate groups, but
he did not elaborate.
   Guerrilla sources said private talks continued Sunday. A council
called to form a government met briefly Friday before disputes
between the rival guerrilla factions stalled progress.
   Kabul's population, meanwhile, has grown to more than 2 million
because of refugees from outlying areas seeking food and shelter,
and the city is facing a severe food shortage.
   The United Nations' Aga Khan said he was trying to find out why
the Ethiopians pulled out of the airlift. Last week, Egypt Air
refused to fly into the embattled city, saying security at the
airport was inadequate.
   The U.N. airlift originally was expected to supply Kabul with 360
tons of supplies and was to be completed by Wednesday.
   Aga Khan denied reports in Geneva and New York that the United
Nations cut a deal with the guerrillas to allow airlifts to Kabul in
exchange for food distribution in guerrilla-held areas.

   President Bush, wrapping up a weekend
visit to his seaside retreat, worshipped Sunday in a country church
where he and his wife, Barbara, were welcomed as ``our old
friends.'' He also met with a group of scholars on U.S.-Soviet
relations.
   Bush invited the academics to his family vacation home to join
him and foreign policy aides for wide-ranging talks, according to
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater called the two-hour session ``open-ended, and not
designed to focus on any particular facet of East-West relations.''
   ``The president is always interested in hearing diverse views on
public policy issues,'' Fitzwater said. ``It was just an
intellectual exercise.'' Neither Bush nor the members of the group
were available to speak to reporters afterward.
   Bush has delayed U.S. participation in the next scheduled round
of arms control talks with the Soviets pending what he has said will
be a thorough review of the current state of U.S.-Soviet relations.
   At the same time, Bush has stressed _ both in his inaugural
address and in his speech last Thursday to a joint session of
Congress _ his desire to work more closely with the Democratic-led
Congress on foreign policy issues.
   Bush reiterated the same theme of closer consultation with
lawmakers and increased bipartisan in a meeting at the White House
last Thursday with leaders of House and Senate foreign relations
committees, according to participants.
   Earlier, the Bushes joined about 60 other worshipers for regular
morning services at Kennebunkport's First Congregational Church.
   Although they are Episcopalian, the Bushes often attend the tiny,
white clapboard church on the outskirts of this southern Maine
seacoast village.
   The Rev. Robert Howes stepped down from his pulpit to personally
address the Bushes, who were seated in a front-row pew.
   ``Mr. president and our first lady, Barbara. You know, I am sure,
how warmly we welcome you, how much it means to us to have you a
member of our congregation.''
   He voiced ``confidence in your wisdom and integrity'' and added:
   ``This is the only time I will address you formally. You are
George and Barbara, our old friends. And we are glad that you are
home with us.''
   The congregation applauded.
   After the service, Bush, wearing an overcoat, stood outside the
snow-coated church in below-freezing but sunny weather and said,
``wasn't that a sweet service?.''
   He shouted a greeting to a group of youths sitting on a fence,
and shook hands with fellow church-goers.
   He also told reporters he was completely over a cold that had
dogged him for two weeks and said he planned to ``take it easy''
most of the rest of the day.
   Fitzwater said that Bush invited the group of scholars, most of
them from the region, on short notice.
   Among those invited were two Harvard professors: Adam B. Ulam,
professor of Russian history and Marshall I. Goldman, associate
director of Harvard's Russian Research Center.
   Also invited were Edward A. Hewett III, senior research fellow at
the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution; Stephen M. Meyer,
associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; and Robert L. Pfaltzgraff Jr., director of
foreign policy analysis at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
   With Bush were National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and
Lawrence S. Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state-designate.
   Bush was to return to Washington on Monday, with a breakfast
speech to a business group in Manchester, N.H., along the way.
   Aides said the Bushes spent much of the weekend unpacking boxes
of personal belongings that had been in the vice presidential
residence in Washington and for which there was no room at the White
House.
   The three-story gray shingle and stone home on a point jutting
out into the Atlantic Ocean is the only home the Bushes own.
   Bush also spent several hours each day working in a small cottage
on the compound that he has designated as an office.
   And he and his wife took time to enjoy a video tape, the movie
``Three Men and a Baby,'' aides said.

   About 40 Jewish settlers protested stonings and
bombings with a sit-in at a Palestinian mayor's office Sunday, and
five Arabs were injured in clashes with soldiers, Israeli and Arab
reports said.
   The protest underscored increasing settler vigilantism that this
month included angry rampages into Arab towns and stoning of Arab
cars.
   ``Me and my friends decided we should get the message across to
Qalqilya and the mayor that we have lost our patience,'' settler
Shlomo Katan told Israel radio after the group barged into Mayor
Mahmoud Abu Sneineh's office in the West Bank city of Qalqilya.
   The settlers warned Abu Sneineh they would riot if he did not
stop Palestinians from stoning and firebombing their cars which pass
through Qalqilya to and from the West Bank.
   Katan, council head in Alfe Menashe settlement, said the settlers
wanted to talk with Sneineh ``in a good atmosphere.'' But Israel
radio said soldiers spirited the mayor out of the office before
talks could take place.
   A military officer forced the settlers out of the office about
three hours later, the reports said.
   Meanwhile, two left-wing members of Parliament sent a letter to
Attorney General Yosef Harish, claiming the sit-in in Qalqilya was
part of a well-planned strategy by a newly created settlers' militia
of ``a few hundred'' members.
   The letter signed by Yossi Sarid and Dedi Zucker, a fellow member
of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement, said the mayor of the
West Bank settement of Ariel, Ron Nachman, is one of the militia's
leaders.
   Nachman told The Associated Press no such militia existed.
   The daily Israeli Haaretz reported Sunday that children from
Kedumim and Karnei Shomron settlements, both near Qalqilya, have
begun stoning Arabs from their school buses in response to the
attacks.
   Also in Qalqilya, soldiers Sunday warned six families that their
homes will be demolished after a resident in each house was arrested
on suspicion of helping firebomb Israeli targets, Arab news reports
said.
   Bamahane Israeli army magazine reported plans to pave roads
through Gaza refugee camps to make it easier to chase rioters.
Similar roads built during anti-guerrilla raids in the 1970s stirred
considerable controversy because many Palestinians were forced from
their homes.
   Among five Palestinians wounded in the occupied territories
Sunday was a 22-year-old Gaza man shot in the head, Arab hospital
officials said.
   At least 380 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed in the
uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987.
   A 70-year-old man from Gaza's Shati refugee camp was in danger of
losing an eye after it was it by a rubber bullet, the Arab hospital
officials said. The army described the man's injury as slight.
   In a West Bank village, about 50 Arab youths marched, chanted
slogans and handed out leaflets urging Palestinians to boycott
Israeli products and not pay taxes.
   Also Sunday, a Palestinian human rights group said a State
Department report released last week fails to go far enough in
criticizing Israel's tactics to quell the uprising.
   Law in the Service of Man, a West Bank affiliate of the
Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists, applauded the
report but said it was ``at times seriously understated.''
   For example, the group claimed 5,500 Palestinians have been
detained at one time, while the American report put the greatest
number detained at any time at 2,600. The report said five
Palestinians have died in detention since Dec. 10, and the group
said 10 have died.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's ruling Communist Party has
moved toward sharing power with other political groups by becoming
the first Eastern European country to endorse a multiparty system.
   Party leader Karoly Grosz announced after a two-day meeting of
the Central Committee that the policy-making body had decided a
multiparty system was the only way to guarantee political pluralism
in Hungary.
   He also indicated the party had revised its view of the 1956
anti-Soviet revolt to acknowledge the uprising started with good
intentions but went sour.
   A multiparty system would ``certainly provide an opportunity for
alliances'' and participation by groups the Communists would not be
able to mobilize on their own, Grosz said in an interview excerpted
on Hungarian radio late Saturday and due for full broadcast Sunday
evening.
   The system is expected to be legal under a new constitution to be
written next year.
   A communique from the Central Committee stressed that the
transition to a multi-party system must be ``gradual and steady,''
to avoid what it termed ``the danger of the process becoming
destabilized and uncontrollable.
   ``That is not in the interest of any force with a sense of
responsibility,'' said the communique released by the state news
agency MTI.
   Grosz said he expected the constitution to require new parties to
operate ``on a socialist basis.''
   ``If they do not accept the constitution, then they cannot
operate legally,'' he said, without elaborating.
   No date has been announced for multiparty local or national
parliamentary elections, but both are due by the end of 1990.
   Grosz's remarks indicated that dozens of political movements,
many of which began in recent months, will be allowed to participate.
   Unlike alternative parties in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and
Poland, Hungary's groups are independent of the Communists.
   A new pro-Marxist group with an anti-Stalinist platform was
founded Saturday. Another group, named after a leader of the
national peasants' party crushed in the Communist takeover in 1948,
announced plans to form a party calling for individual land
ownership.
   Hungarians from the alternative groups and Western diplomats saw
Grosz's statement as a victory for Communist Party reformers. They
include Politburo member Imre Pozsgay, who two weeks ago presented a
startling reassessment of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt.
   Pozsgay said the revolt was a popular uprising, not a
counterrevolution as it has been officially called for 32 years. The
comment triggered enormous public debate.
   Grosz indicated the committee had reached a compromise on the
official view of the 1956 revolt.
   He said it started as an uprising in which many ``honest people''
fought against a dated regime, but ended with ``counterrevolutionary
elements'' gradually gaining strength.
   During the past 30 years the official view had become distorted,
and ``we forgot those popular elements,'' he said.
   Many party conservatives owe their jobs to supporting the idea
that the revolt was a counterrevolution justly crushed by the Soviet
military.
   Imre Nagy led the revolt against the regime of the Stalinist
Matyas Rakosi. It started Oct. 23, 1956, and was brought to a bloody
end Nov. 4 of that year.
   In a statement to Vasarnapi Hirek, the nation's Sunday newspaper,
party spokesman Emil Kimmel said the initial uprising took ``the
form of the intention to establish `democratic socialism.'''
   Before the Central Committee session opened Friday, 15 political
groups issued a statement saying they could not cooperate with the
Communist government unless the party changed its stand on 1956.
   Ferenc Koeszeg of the Alliance of Free Democrats said the party's
apparently revised stand seemed ``an attempt to find a compromise.
It's little for us, certainly, but it's the beginning of a process.''
   The re-evaluation of 1956 and the emergence of alternative
political groups have come at a time of increasing dissatisfaction
over Hungary's stagnant economy and austerity measures.
   During the weekend, the government announced the third round of
price increases this year, raising the cost of canned and preserved
goods by up to 30 percent.
   The official trade unions have publicly broken with the
government over price increases and have demanded an immediate
increase in the minimum wage, now about $70 a month.

   The governing Liberal Democratic Party, under attack
for a stock scandal and a new sales tax, suffered a setback in a
closely watched special parliamentary election on Sunday.
   In the race for a seat in Parliament's upper house, Socialist
Sadao Fuchigami defeated Kei Oma of Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita's party, according to election officials in southern
Fukuoka prefecture.
   In celebrations televised by the Japan Broadcasting Corp.,
Fuchigami told his supporters: ``The people's complaints against the
(stock) scandal and consumer tax led to my victory.''
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Japan Socialist Party,
said his party will call for the resignation of Takeshita's Cabinet,
dissolution of Parliament's more powerful lower house and a general
election, Kyodo News Service reported.
   Kyodo said the Liberal Democratic Party's secretary-general,
Shintaro Abe, promised his party would accept the election outcome
and go to work on reforms to restore public confidence.
   Sunday's election was the first involving a national office since
the stock scandal surfaced last summer and since Parliament passed a
3 percent sales tax in December.
   The stock scandal has led to the resignations of three members of
Takeshita's Cabinet and more than a dozen other prominent
politicians and businessmen. It also has raised questions about
influence peddling.
   The election was seen as a possible indicator of what might
happen in July when elections are held for half the seats in
Parliament's upper house. Liberal Democrats now hold 143 of the 251
seats.
   Severe setbacks in the elections would endanger Takeshita's
chances of winning another two-year term as party president and
prime minister next October.
   Sunday's special election was for the seat held by a Liberal
Democrat who died in December.
   With all the votes counted by late Sunday night, the election
committee said Fuchigami garnered 751,036 votes against 564,301 for
Oma, 170,778 for Tatsuzen Fujino of the Japan Communist Party and
160,294 for Kozo Maeda of the Salaried Workers' New Party.
   Fuchigami, 51, is vice chairman of the Japan Socialist Party's
Fukuoka prefectural branch.
   An estimated 48.6 percent of the 3.4 million eligible voters cast
ballots Sunday, compared with 74.5 percent in the previous upper
house election in 1986 and 56.8 percent in 1983. The 1986 turnout
was high because the election was held with one in the more powerful
lower house.
   Japan's current Parliament session opened Friday.
   Takeshita told lawmakers that he will ``honestly accept the harsh
criticism'' over the stock scandal and try to restore public
confidence in government.
   The scandal involves Recruit Co., an information services
conglomerate that has been accused of trying to gain favor in
political circles.
   It sold unlisted stocks in a subsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos real
estate company, at bargain prices to more than 150 influential
politicians, bureaucrats and journalists before public trading in
the shares began in October 1986.
   The share prices rose sharply then, and some buyers made nearly
$80,000 in tax-free profits.

   About 1,500 people crowded into a Roman
Catholic church Sunday to hear Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who helped
reopen a former convent as a new home for part of her missionary
order.
   ``I hope they're going to do something beautiful for God,''
Mother Teresa said at the morning Mass at St. Mary's Roman Catholic
Church. ``It is very important to help each other and share with
each other.''
   The visit by the winner of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize was later
cut short when she started feeling faint and was helped out of the
church to rest.
   St. Mary's Convent, formerly home of Sisters of Charity but
closed for 17 years because of declining membership, will be home to
13 nuns who are members of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity,
Contemplative Branch, said the Rev. Joseph J. Mirandi, pastor of the
church.
   The nuns will spend seven hours a day in prayer and two hours
visiting nursing homes, hospitals and families in the neighborhood,
Mirandi said. Mother Teresa's Contemplative Branch was established
in the United States in 1976 and there are about five missions in
the country, he said.
   Mother Teresa, 78, founded the Missionaries of Charity, an order
of 3,000 nuns in 87 countries, in 1950. She became known as the
``Saint of Calcutta'' for her work with the poor in that Indian city.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen burst into a home Sunday
and fatally shot a Roman Catholic lawyer who recently represented
the family of a slain IRA guerrilla and a man accused of killing two
soldiers.
   Police said three men broke into the north Belfast house of
Patrick Finucane, 30, and opened fire on him and his wife,
Geraldine, who was believed to be slightly wounded in the leg.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion
fell on Protestant extremists.
   Police were investigating reports that a taxi hijacked in a
loyalist Protestant area of the city was used in the attack.
   The Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant paramilitary
group, has slain two Roman Catholics in Belfast in the past two
weeks.
   Finucane was a prominent Northern Ireland lawyer. Late last year
he was involved in the Craigavon, County Armagh, inquest into the
1983 police killings of three unarmed Irish Republican Army
guerrillas who the families claimed were victims of an alleged
police ``shoot to kill'' campaign against Irish nationalists.
   Finucane, acting for the family of one of the dead, Eugene Toman,
went to the Northern Ireland High Court demanding that three
policemen involved in the shooting be forced to attend and give
evidence to the inquest.
   The coroner had initially directed that the policemen need not
attend but only submit statements.
   Finucane eventually won his case, but on appeal by the
authorities the inquest was adjourned indefinitely.
   In a recent case, Finucane succeeded in having charges dropped
against a man in connection with the killing of two soldiers at an
IRA funeral last year.
   Finucane's brother Dermot, who escaped from Belfast's Maze Prison
where he was serving a term for terrorist offenses, is fighting
extradition from the Irish Republic to Ulster where he is wanted for
questioning in connection with the killing of a policeman. The case
will be heard at Dublin High Court on Tuesday.
   The predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to
push the British out of this Protestant-dominated province, join it
with the Republic of Ireland and set up an all-Ireland socialist
state.

<HEAD>Brake Failure to Blame for Runaway Train, Inspectors Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crew of a runaway train that caused a
devastating explosion earlier this month apparently set the train's
air brakes, but it remains a mystery why the brakes failed, federal
inspectors said.
   But Montana Rail Link officials, federal inspectors and employees
disagree over whether the train's hand brakes also should have been
set while the crew changed locomotives near the Continental Divide
on Feb. 2.
   Forty-eight cars got away from the crew about nine miles west of
Helena and rolled back into town, colliding with a three-locomotive
unit.
   Twenty-one cars derailed and one containing hydrogen peroxide
exploded shortly before 5 a.m., shattering windows up to two miles
away, spewing shrapnel for hundreds of yards and knocking out power
for up to six hours in parts of Helena.
   About 2,000 people were evacuated within a square mile of the
accident in 30-below-zero weather. Officials estimated the damage at
$3 million, although only a few people suffered minor injuries.
   David Ditzel, a member of the National Transportation Safety
Board's field investigation into the accident, said an event
recorder indicates that before the train's six locomotives were
separated from the 48 cars, a ``substantial application'' of the air
brakes was made.
   ``They (air brakes) should have held the train,'' he said late
last week. ``But it is obvious they didn't.''
   Post-accident tests indicated air brakes on four cars were
defective and other brakes may have been coated with ice and snow,
possibly hampering their effectiveness, Ditzel adds.
   William Loftus, executive director of the Federal Railroad
Administration, said the hand brakes also should have been set, but
were not. But Montana Rail Link officials debate that contention.
   William Brodsky, president of the company, said he does not
believe failure to set the hand brakes was a violation of operation
procedure.
   The General Code of Operating Rules, a set of regulations
followed by 13 major railroads, including Montana Rail Link, says
air brakes ``must not be depended upon to hold a train, engine or
car when left unattended.''
   Brodsky said the phrase ``left unattended'' means when cars that
are left for an extended period without supervision, perhaps as long
as several days. Over long periods of time, air brakes can lose
their holding ability. The hand brakes are used as a backup.

   Former Klan leader David Duke has sidestepped
several attempts to derail his candidacy for the Louisiana
Legislature, and is mounting a door-to-door push for the final week
of the campaign.
   Opponents were thwarted last week in two actions designed to
discredit Duke's candidacy. A lawsuit challenging his residency was
not filed, although it still might be later, and militant Jewish
protesters were unable to obtain a last-minute parade permit.
   Duke, 38, and John Treen, 62, are contenders Saturday for a state
House seat from a nearly all-white district in Jefferson Parish, a
New Orleans suburb. Both men are Republicans.
   ``I think we're going to win ... with about 54 percent of the
vote or better,'' Duke said. ``I think that the attacks, the
character assassinations, make people more determined than ever to
make their own choice.''
   The race between the articulate Duke and Treen, a conservative
home builder whose brother Dave was the first Republican governor
since Reconstruction, has generated contributions and comment from
around the country.
   The New York-based Jewish Defense Organization held an indoor
rally Sunday to warn people about Duke. A protest march by the group
through downtown New Orleans was canceled because the group's leader
Mordechai Levy failed to obtain a parade permit 15 days in advance
of the event.
   ``As a man I do not hate Mr. Duke,'' the Rev. Marie Galatas, a
black activist, told the crowd of less than 100. ``But I think he is
a threat and he is very dangerous for what he believes in and what
he stands for.''
   Duke, who was imperal wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
before he left the group in 1980, led a field of seven candidates in
last month's primary with 33 percent of the vote. Treen came in
second with 19 percent of the vote.
   Under Louisiana's open primary system, the top two vote-getters
in the primary go into the runoff, whatever their party, if no
candidates gets more than half the vote.
   Attorney Dave Sherman, representing some of the failed
candidates, has delayed until after the election filing a lawsuit
challenging Duke's residency in the House district.
   Sherman said Duke's claims that he lived in a condominium in the
district appear to be fraudulent because utility records indicate
the residence had no electricity until last September.
   Duke, who said he won't talk about his living arrangements
because of threats, will spend the last week of the race going
door-to-door in the 21,000-voter district.
   ``People now know that we can win. People have been waiting for a
long time for a candidate to come across and talk about these
issues,'' Duke said. ``If David Duke wins this race, it will break
the ice.''
   Issues on Duke's platform include requiring welfare recipients to
work, offering incentives for women on welfare to be sterilized,
providing tax credits for education, eliminating affirmative action
programs and keeping a property tax exemption for home owners.
   ``I think nobody really understood how deep the support is for
the programs I represent,'' Duke said.
   Treen accused Duke of jumping on the Republican bandwagon, saying
lower taxes, less government and self-sufficiency have been GOP
goals for years.
   Duke's candidacy has brought widespread opposition.
   President Bush's son, George Jr., appeared in Metairie a week ago
and backed Treen, saying the GOP has no place for Klansmen.
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Philip Hannan and other religious
leaders had a vigil last week in apparent opposition to Duke's
candidacy, although Treen was never mentioned by name.
   ``We cannot allow the philosophy of the white hood ... to gain
acceptability,'' said Rabbi Robert Loewy.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer has said the election of Duke would send a
``terrible signal'' to the country about Louisiana.
   Duke, who joined the Ku Klux Klan as a teen-ager, left after
being accused of trying to sell secret Klan membership rolls. He
began calling himself a white civil rights worker and founded the
National Association for the Advancement of White People, but he
said it is not racist but aims at civil rights for all people.
   During the campaign, he has answered accusations that a telephone
number listed to the Klan rings in his home by saying he is just
trying to make it easier for people to contact him.

<HEAD>Security Council To Approve Namibian Peacekeeping Force This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council this week will approve
a U.N. peacekeeping force in Namibia of 4,650 troops, officials
said, far fewer than the number demanded by black African nations.
   After weeks of lobbying for 7,500 peacekeepers, African countries
and non-aligned nations have agreed to send the smaller contingent
proposed by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The five permanent Security Council members _ the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain, France and China _ had pushed for the less
costly smaller force, which is still expected to cost about $416
million for one year.
   The 7,500 peacekeepers would have cost about $700 million, U.N.
officials have said.
   The black African nations contended that cutting the size of the
Namibian force would signal the population there that the United
Nations was more concerned about cost-cutting than ending South
Africa's 74-year rule over the territory, Africa's last colony.
   Black African nations also feared that a reduced peacekeeping
force would tempt South Africa to tamper with elections in Namibia
in November to prevent the main guerrilla group, the South-West
Africa People's Organization, from winning a majority.
   Namibians are to election a constituent assembly that will adopt
a constitution and organize a black majority-ruled government.
   In a report released Friday, Perez de Cuellar assured the black
African nations that the permanent Security Council members would
allow him to dispatch up to 7,500 troops if the military situation
in Namibia warrants.
   Perez de Cuellar also authorized the peacekeepers to carry
weapons, an exception to the normal policy under which peacekeepers
are unarmed.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Friday that he expected the
Security Council to approve the secretary-general's recommendations
Monday or Tuesday. The five permanent Security Council members, who
together pay 57 percent of the cost of peacekeeping, contended that
a peace accord signed in December by South Africa, Angola and Cuba
reduced the need for peacekeepers.
   Under the accords, 50,000 Cuban troops are to be withdrawn from
Angola by mid-1991, with half of them out by November, as South
Africa cooperates with the U.N.'s one-year plan for Namibia's
independence beginning April 1.
   Namibia is half the size of Western Europe, but has a population
of 1.3 million, one-tenth of whom are whites. r

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister-elect Michael Manley and
the defeated Edward Seaga joined about 500 people in church Sunday
for a special ``service of national peace and unity'' after a tense
election campaign.
   The longtime and often bitter rivals smiled and shook hands as
they took seats in the front pew of St. Andrew Parish Church. They
sat next to Governor-General Sir Florizel Glasspole, who is to swear
Manley in on Monday.
   Manley, 64, bruised his right shin Saturday when a car he was
riding in collided head-on with a pickup truck, but he showed no
signs of injury on Sunday.
   The Gothic-style church was filled, and several people stood in
the doorways for the solemn service.
   The congregation, which included U.S. Ambassador Michael Sotirhos
and many other diplomats, sang the Jamaican national anthem and
patriotic hymns such as ``Once To Every Man and Nation'' and ``I
Pledge My Heart Forever.''
   In his sermon, the Rev. C. Evans Bailey, a Methodist minister,
reminded the gathering of New Testament teachings to turn the other
cheek and not take vengeance.
   ``We have left behind us, we pray, a situation in which our
country reached almost the very depths of insanity,'' he said.
   Manley, who was prime minister from 1972 to 1980, was returned to
power Thursday in a landslide victory over Seaga, a conservative who
led the country for eight years.
   Some ballots still were being recounted during the weekend and
final results were not available. Revised unofficial results gave
Manley's People's National Party 45 seats in Parliament to 15 for
Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party.
   Seaga's party had held all 60 parliamentary seats since Manley
boycotted the last election, in 1983, in a dispute over voter
registration lists.
   The prime minister-elect had said he wanted to hold an ecumenical
service before being sworn in Monday to foster a sense of national
unity and patriotism in the aftermath of the hard-fought campaign.
   On entering the church Sunday, Seaga said he expected the new
government to take over in a conciliatory atmosphere. ``I started my
term that way, and I expect this term will start that way, too,'' he
told a reporter.
   Warfare between political gangs left at least 13 people dead and
scores wounded during the three-week campaign.
   The violence was nowhere near as bad as in 1980, when Jamaica
last held a contested election. Then, an estimated 700 people died
during a nine-month campaign.
   Manley and Seaga left the church together, shaking hands with
well-wishers. Manley was briefly mobbed by supporters at his car. At
one stage, he raised a finger to his lips to shush the crowd.
   Glasspole, as representative of Queen Elizabeth II, is to swear
Manley into office Monday afternoon. Jamaica, which gained
independence from Britain in 1962 belongs to the British
Commonwealth, the global association of former British colonies and
territories headed by the queen.
   Seaga, 58, remains prime minister until Manley is sworn in.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Asks Iran To Provide Proof Of Hostage Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand on Sunday called on
Iran to prove that France had agreed to free a terrorist in exchange
for the release of French hostages in Beirut.
   Iran has claimed that France promised to free Anis Naccache, a
Lebanese national and convicted leader of a pro-Iranian terror
squad, in exchange for three French hostages released in May.
   Naccache is serving a life sentence for leading an assassination
attempt against former Iranian Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar in
1980. Bakhtiar survived but a French woman and a police officer were
killed.
   Mitterrand said that when Chirac submitted his resignation
following elections that returned a Socialist government to power
last spring, he did not ask for Naccache's release.
   Speaking on the weekly television news show ``Seven on Seven,''
Mitterrand said that Chirac assured him that the only committment
France had made was to promise ``to restore diplomatic relations''
with Iran.
   ``I have no reason to doubt the words of Mr. Chirac,'' the
president said, adding that it was necessary for ``the Iranians to
provide proof that France has failed to meet its committments.
   ``If such is the case, it is understood that France's word will
be kept. But to my knowledge, this is not the case.''
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas discussed the matter with his
Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati while on a trip to Iran last
week. Velayati said there was a gentlemen's agreement to free
Naccache, confirmed in telephone calls from Chirac to Iranian
officials.
   The president of Iran's parliament, Hachemi Rafsandjani, on
Saturday repeated the claim that Iran was guaranteed Naccache's
release.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said last week ``unfortunately, we
have no official report, no trace of the conditions in which the
release of the hostages was negotiated by the Chirac government.''
   He said he asked for a written report from his predecessor,
Charles Pasqua, who led the effort to free the hostages, but was
turned down.
   Mitterrand noted in the interview Sunday that Naccache and four
other members of the terrorist gang ``were convicted of crimes.''
   ``They are not hostages. We do not take hostages,'' he said.
   There are 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon. They include nine
Americans, three Britons, one Belgian, one Irishman and one Italian.
The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   The yacht Thursday's Child sailed
triumphantly under the Golden Gate Bridge on Sunday, breaking by
eight days the New York-to-San Francisco speed record set in 1854.
   The 60-foot sloop crossed the finish line at 12:32 p.m. and was
met by cheers and yells from hundreds of spectators. Thursday's
Child set sail Nov. 23 on a 14,500-mile voyage that took it around
treacherous Cape Horn on the tip of South America.
   ``I wouldn't do anything different, but I wouldn't do it again _
once is enough,'' said skipper-owner Warren Luhrs after he stepped
ashore.
   Luhrs and the other two crew members waved to the crowd after
bettering the 89-day, eight-hour trip by the 229-foot clipper ship
Flying Cloud during the Gold Rush.
   The crew docked the 10-ton vessel at Blossom Rock, about two
miles from the Golden Gate, because they said the submerged point is
where clipper ships used to drop anchor.
   About 80 ships were out on San Francisco Bay to greet the modern
racing sloop, while other spectators gathered on the roof of Fort
Point and at the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. A biplane
flew overhead trailing a sign that read: ``We love you TC.''
   Thursday's Child's entrance into the bay was delayed for hours by
a four-knot outgoing tide and by a lack of wind.
   The crew tried everything, including putting out a large sail
called a spinnaker, but all its sails drooped. Finally, under a
bright, cloudless sky the yacht was able to sail under the Golden
Gate.
   Dozens of sailboats and powerboats had headed out the Golden Gate
for the occasion and the Coast Guard sent a 95-foot cutter and four
utility boats to escort the yacht into the bay and lessen the danger
of a spectator boat accidentally ramming Thursday's Child.
   The yacht left from Sandy Hook Bay, 18 miles south of New York
City, and arrived in San Francisco after 80 days and 20 hours, said
Thomas Conroy, race timekeeper at the St. Francis Yacht Club. He
said Thursday's Child broke three other sailing records; New York to
the equator, set in 1856; New York to Cape Horn, 1857; and Cape Horn
to San Francisco, 1854. The times and old records were not
immediately available.
   In a ship-to-shore interview earlier Sunday, crew member Courtney
Hazleton said he had ``that coming-home feeling.''
   ``It's kind of like a mixed bag of emotions right now,'' said
Hazleton. ``Both relief, letdown, that the whole thing's over, and
just a general feeling of accomplishment.''
   The crew _ Hazleton, 32, of Palmetto, Fla.; Luhrs, 44, of
Alachua, Fla.; and Lars Bergstrom, 54, of Sarasota, Fla, who helped
design the vessel _ had spent Saturday zig-zagging north against a
stubborn headwind that delayed the ship's arrival by one day.
   Luhrs launched Thursday's Child for the 1984 solo trans-Atlantic
race, in which she was the first American entry and the first
single-hulled boat to finish.
   The Flying Cloud was a merchantman that also ferried Gold Rush
adventurers around the dangerous Cape Horn at the tip of South
America and up to San Francisco. It could carry 35 sails on its tall
masts and was the fastest of thousands of clippers that raced each
other across the Atlantic and Pacific.
   The ship wrecked on rocks off St. Johns, Newfoundland, in 1874
and nothing is left of it.
   In the past seven years, five racing boats trying to beat Flying
Cloud's record sank in the howling gales and treacherous rocks of
Cape Horn.
   A second boat also attempting to break Flying Cloud's record was
damaged last week in a storm off Cape Horn. The Bark of the West, a
60-foot monohull, was in its 56th day of sailing.
   Thursday's Child also had trouble during its run at the record;
it had to stop at the Falkland Islands for repairs after it struck
an unknown object.
   The modern vessel survived Cape Horn, but Hazleton expressed awe
and respect for the power of the sea when he recalled the passage
around the cape.
   `It got pretty bad ... very unpleasant,'' Hazelton said in an
interview by radio last week. He said they spent six days and nights
sailing into the teeth of wind gusting to 60 knots, through seas
that raged from all directions.

   A newspaper reported Sunday
that Winnie Mandela, the wife of jailed African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, took part in the beatings of young boys
allegedly abducted by her bodyguards.
   One the boys, 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, had been missing since
Jan. 1 and his body was reportedly found last week.
   The Sunday Star, a Johannesburg newspaper that opposes apartheid,
said Mrs. Mandela whipped four boys brought to her house in Soweto
last month by young men who call themselves the Mandela United
soccer team. The paper did not identify its sources.
   The report deepened the controversy surrounding Mrs. Mandela, who
has denied wrongdoing and implied allegations against her were
fabricated to hurt her husband.
   Mrs. Mandela, 54, in responding to allegations against her
Friday, told CBS News, ``It's not going to destroy Mandela.''
   ``It's absurd that this particular name (Mandela) and this family
can be associated with all the allegations that are being flung
around,'' she said.
   Prominent Soweto activists and Methodist Church leaders have
accused Mandela United members of assaulting four boys after
abducting them from a church in Soweto, a black township outside
Johannesburg.
   The Star said one of the youths escaped and alerted community
leaders meeting at a nearby Methodist church.
   Dr. Abu Baker Asvat, a well-known anti-apartheid physician,
eventually went to the house, saw the beaten boys, ``and warned that
Stompie had been so badly assaulted that he would not live,'' the
newspaper said.
   The next day, Asvat was shot and killed at his Soweto office by
two young men pretending to be patients. Police are investigating
the killing.
   Mrs. Mandela told CBS News that no Mandela United members were
involved in Stompie's disappearance.
   She was quoted Sunday by the black-oriented City Press newspaper
as acknowledging the boys were taken to her home but denying she was
present.
   City Press quoted Jerry Richardson, who describes himself as
Mandela United's former coach, as saying he hit the boys to make
them admit they had been sexually molested by a white Methodist
minister.
   ``I gave them a few smacks to make them tell the truth,''
Richardson, 41, was quoted as saying.
   The Rev. Stanley Mogoba, national leader of the Methodist Church,
said the allegations against the Rev. Paul Verryn were fabricated to
divert attention from the ``ruthless actions of the `football team'
and the disappearance and possible death of Stompie.''
   The Weekly Mail, another anti-apartheid newspaper, on Friday
quoted an unidentified Soweto activist as saying Seipei's body was
dug up Thursday in the township. Police said Friday that the report
could not be confirmed.
   Exiled African National Congress leaders and prominent
anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa, including Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have urged Mrs. Mandela to disband Mandela
United. She said the team has been disbanded, but about eight young
men continue to live at her house.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok has said police investigating
the case expect difficulty finding witnesses willing to testify
against Mrs. Mandela.
   Nelson Mandela, the country's best-known black leader, is serving
a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the
government.

   Yasser Arafat said Israeli authorities have secretly
contacted the Palestine Liberation Organization, according to an
Italian newspaper.
   However, the PLO leader said the Israeli government also was
planning ``new attacks on our leadership,'' according to an
interview in the Rome-based daily Il Messaggero.
   Israeli authorities ``are sending us many messages secretly,
through our representatives in the occupied territories (and) other
channels in Europe and elsewhere,'' Arafat said in the interview
published Saturday.
   Israel officially says it will not negotiate directly with the
PLO.
   In Jerusalem, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said: ``The ministry
of foreign affairs has had no contacts wth the PLO'' and that he had
no knowledge of planned attacks on PLO leaders.
   PLO officials have held unofficial meetings with members of the
center-left Labor Party and left-wing members of Parliament.
   Asked who contacted the PLO, Arafat said: ``I'm speaking of
Israeli authorities. And in the past there were also these kinds of
indirect contacts. Also during the occupation of Beirut there were
negotiations through Philip Habib, the special (U.S.) envoy from
Washington.''
   Israel sent troops into Lebanon in 1982, forcing the PLO to
abandon Beirut.
   Arafat said in spite of the contacts, he has received information
that the Israeli secret service has orders to ``bring forth new
attacks on our leadership.'' He did not give details.
   ``At the same time, (the Israelis) are planning a scenario of war
in southern Lebanon'' for the late spring or summer, he said.
   Israeli troops and Palestinian guerrillas have clashed frequently
in south Lebanon since Israel withdrew most of its soldiers from the
neighboring country in 1985. Israeli troops remain in Israel's
self-designated security zone along the border.
   Arafat also said he would agree to Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin's proposal to hold elections in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip only ``after the withdrawal of Israeli
troops and under United Nations supervision.''
   In the past, PLO leaders have said they will not agree to
elections in the occupied territories until the area receives
complete autonomy.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has said Israel's army would
withdraw from several cities in the occupied territories if the
Palestinian inhabitants accepted ``limited autonomy.''

   A teen-ager opened fire with an automatic pistol
on a crowded subway platform early Sunday, wounding six people, one
seriously, police said.
   The gunman fired a 9mm automatic pistol at a group of about 40
people waiting on a platform in the Bronx borough about 1:10 a.m.,
said Al O'Leary, a Transit Police spokesman.
   The suspect, who witnesses described as being about 17 years old,
fled and no arrests were made, officials said. No weapon was
recovered but five 9mm shell casings were found.
   The gunman may have been retaliating for not being allowed into a
birthday party at a nearby apartment house, said Transit Police
chief, Charles Mills. At least one of the victims attended the
party, he said.
   Four men and two teen-age girls were wounded. One of the men, who
was struck in the stomach, was in serious condition, O'Leary said.
The others were in satisfactory condition, he said.

   Government officials were questioning
22 fishermen Monday who returned to South Korea after 15 days of
captivity in communist North Korea.
   The fishermen arrived in the port of Inchon aboard two trawlers
Sunday and were met by government security officials who declined to
be identified.
   In the past, fishermen captured and released by the north have
been questioned several days before being allowed to return to their
families. North and South Korea, divided since 1945, are still
technically at war and a peace treaty never has been signed.
   North Korea seized the fishermen and their two ships on Jan. 28,
saying the vessels had illegally entered North Korean territorial
waters in the Yellow Sea.
   On Friday, the president of South Korea's Red Cross, Kim
Sang-hyup, said he had been notified the north would return the
fishermen for humanitarian reasons.
   He said a message from his northern counterpart, Son Sung Pil,
said the decision also was made out of a desire to seek national
reconciliation and reunify the two Koreas.
   South Korea's Office of Fisheries had claimed that the two boats
were captured by a North Korean navy patrol boat while fishing in
international waters.
   The area where the boats were seized is close to the sea
extension of the Korean Military Demarcation Line that separates the
two Koreas roughly along the 38th parallel. North Korea has seized
many South Korean fishing boats in the area in the past, but
returned most of them.

   A pilot made an emergency landing in a field
when his plane ran out of fuel, then took a bus home without
reporting the incident, triggering an overnight search, police said.
   Officials with the Federal Aviation Adminstration initiated the
search after they received a distress signal from the downed
airplane's emergency locator Saturday night.
   Clark County Sheriff's officials found the Cessna 150 plane
Sunday morning.
   John McIntyre, 42, of Hazelwood, was en route to Jacksonville,
Ill., from Creve Coeur, Ill., when he ran out of fuel, said a
sheriff's spokesman. He landed about 11:30 a.m. Saturday in a wooded
pasture in the northeast corner of Missouri.
   He was not injured and the plane received only minor damage.
McIntyre hitched a ride to nearby Keokuk, Iowa, where he caught a
bus home, officials said.
   Clark County officials, the Missouri State Highway Patrol, the
FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating
why McIntyre did not report the incident and why he strayed from his
course.

<HEAD>Soviet Foreign Minister to Visit Jordan, Egypt This Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
will visit Jordan and Egypt this month, officials said, indicating
an increasing Soviet role in the Middle East conflict.
   King Hussein said the Soviet minister will visit Jordan on Feb.
19 and the king indicated he had little objection to renewed Soviet
relations with Israel if they lead to an Arab-Israeli peace
conference.
   ``If there is a move toward the establishment of peace, obviously
any objections to anyone restoring relations with anyone in this
part of the world become of secondary importance,'' Hussein said in
an interview with Japanese reporters.
   Restoration of Soviet-Israeli relations, severed during the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, are an Israeli condition for the Soviet role in
Middle East peace talks demanded by Hussein and other Arab leaders.
   Hussein said he was ``quite optimistic'' that an international
conference peace could take place soon, given recent U.S. and Soviet
efforts to solve other regional problems.
   He urged Israeli leaders to abandon their opposition to involving
the Palestine Liberation Organization in peace talks.
   ``I can't see any solution to the Palestinian problem without the
participation of the Palestinians,'' the king said.
   Hussein refused to commit Jordan to a confederation with a
proposed Palestinian state _ an idea floated earlier partly to
overcome Israeli and American opposition to an independent
Palestinian entity.
   In Cairo, Soviet Ambassador Gennady Zhuravlev told reporters
Shevaradnadze is expected to visit the Egyptian capital some time
this month, though no exact date has been set. Zhuravlev spoke to
reporters after a meeting with Egypt's Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid.
   The last Soviet foreign minister to visit Cairo was Andrei
Gromyko in 1975, three years after late President Anwar Sadat
expelled 15,000 Soviet military advisers in anger over Moscow's
refusal to supply Egypt the arms it wanted.
   Relations between Cairo and Moscow remained sour during the 1970s
and improved only after President Hosni Mubarak took office in 1981.
Diplomatic ties were resumed at the ambassadorial level in 1984.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and the
prosecution in Oliver North's Iran-Contra case agreed Sunday on more
stringent safeguards for classified material whose threatened
release delayed the trial.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist on Sunday granted a Justice
Department request to delay North's trial from Monday's scheduled
start until Friday, when the full Supreme Court is scheduled to
consider the department's objections to the planned release of
classified material by North's defense.
   Hours later, Thornburgh and independent counsel Lawrence Walsh
announced a motion had been filed asking the judge in the case, U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, to impose more stringent
safeguards on North's use of classified material.
   ``The requested relief, if granted, would provide necessary
assurance that the Attorney General would remain in a position
throughout the trial to protect against unauthorized disclosure of
classified information,'' the Justice Department said in a
statement. Thornburgh and Walsh agreed that this protection ``does
not interfere in any way with the Independent Counsel's ability to
carry out his duties,'' said the statement.
   If the proposal is approved by Gesell, the Justice Department
will ask the Supreme Court to lift the stay immediately so the North
trial may proceed, according to separate statements issued by the
department and Walsh.
   Walsh and the department filed a sealed motion with Gesell
``which requests that the district court enter an additional
protective order preventing the release of classified information
vital to U.S. national security interests,'' the Justice Department
said.
   North's attorneys, Brendan Sullivan and Barry Simon, did not
return phone calls to their business answering service seeking
comment.
   Rehnquist on Sunday ordered ``that the trial proceedings in
United States versus Oliver L. North ... be stayed'' pending
consideration by the full Supreme Court on Friday.
   A jury in the case was selected Thursday and returns to court
Monday morning.
   Walsh, whose office is prosecuting North, had opposed the Justice
Department's efforts to delay the trial and wanted to proceed
immediately with opening arguments, saying that national security
concerns had been amply addressed.
   The Justice Department, reflecting concerns of U.S. intelligence
agencies, feels that Gesell has imposed inadequate controls on North
and that the fired National Security Council aide would be permitted
to pour out secrets in the courtroom that are damaging to national
security.
   ``The Department of Justice concluded, and the Independent
Counsel concurred, that the trial could not go forward without an
additional protective order, and that it is essential for the court
to enter such an order,'' said the Justice Department.
   It said that without such an order, the Justice Department
concluded and the Independent Counsel concurred, ``that it will be
impossible during the defense's opening statement and presentation
of evidence to protect against the unnecessary and uncontrolled
disclosure of classified information.'' The information was
described in the Justice Department statement as ``of vital
importance to the national security and the foreign relations of the
United States.''
   The department said that ``an enormous number'' of the 300
classified documents North may use at his trial ``are not yet
clearly covered by a protective order of the court.''
   The department said it believes that ``the joint motion will
resolve any remaining differences with respect to the handling of
classified information.''
   Walsh issued a separate statement saying that the independent
counsel filed the motion with Gesell and that the Justice Department
``agreed to the motion.''
   Government sources familiar with the agreement say the Justice
Department retreated from the drastic position it took Wednesday.
   The department at that time sought a court order saying North
would be permitted to introduce no classified information unless the
court ruled that it was relevant and the U.S. government had no
objection to its disclosure.
   Under the motion filed with Gesell, the Justice Department
compromised by narrowing the broad objections it had to many
categories of classified material that North plans to introduce at
his trial, said government sources familiar with the proposed
agreement.
   Gesell on Wednesday rejected the depatment's request for the
order seeking stringent controls over classified material North
plans to present and the Justice Department on Thursday began its
efforts to delay the trial. The department sought to appeal, but an
appeals court twice rebuffed the department's attempt to obtain a
stay late last week.
   The department on Saturday went to the Supreme Court in an
attempt to delay the trial and the special prosecutor's office
quickly filed counter arguments.
   The possibility of a compromise by the Justice Department came up
Saturday when a government source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the department wanted to try to work with Walsh's
office to resolve differences, which surfaced Wednesday.
   The source said there would be a two-prong approach, with the
attempt at cooperation taking place at the same time the department
worked on preparing an affidavit to the court from the attorney
general that would in effect bar disclosure of certain classified
material North plans to use on the grounds that it would harm
national security.
   Depending on the scope of the affidavit, such a drastic step
could have led to dismissal of some or all of the 12 criminal
charges against North, because he would be barred from using
classified material in an attempt to prove his innocence.
   Gesell issued orders Dec. 12 and Jan. 19 spelling out how much
censorship could be applied to classified material that the
prosecution and defense planned to use at trial. The Justice
Department criticized Gesell's efforts in a Supreme Court filing on
Saturday.
   ``The categories of information covered by the two orders were by
no means exhaustive,'' said the Justice Department. ``Much
classified information remained unprotected and was not the subject
of any pretrial ruling on admissibility.''

   Investigators suspect a fire that whipped
through a historic shoe manufacturing district and destroyed six
buildings was set by arsonists, police said.
   No one was seriously injured in the blaze, which caused an
estimated $1 million damage as it roared out of control for more
than two hours Saturday night, officials said.
   ``Nothing's for certain yet, but they do have reason to believe
at this point that it was of suspicious origin,'' said police Sgt.
Richard T. Smith. ``One thing was the speed with which it took off.''
   The fire apparently broke out at about 10:30 p.m. in the former
Birney Shoe Co. building, which was erected in 1882.
   Several of the buildings housed shops, a tanning salon, pizza
parlor, offices and other small businesses in the district, which
was once the city's shoe manufacturing center.

   The designated successor to Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini called for an end to extremism in remarks
published Sunday and urged Iran's leaders to ``make up for past
mistakes'' that isolated the Islamic republic.
   Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri's comments, published by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency and Tehran's Abrar daily,
echoed recent calls by other Iranian leaders for critical
self-examination as the Iranian revolution moves into its second
decade.
   Montazeri went further, however, by questioning the official
doctrine that Iran won the eight-year war against Iraq.
   ``People in the world got the idea that our business in Iran is
just murdering people,'' Montazeri was quoted as saying in criticism
of the self-imposed isolation. He spoke in the holy city of Qom on
Saturday at the climax of 10 days of celebrations marking the
revolution's 10th anniversary.
   Montazeri, 64, has been increasingly critical of the revolution's
shortcomings and repeatedly has called for a relaxation of its
stringent religious, social and political restrictions.
   In another indication of a more open political atmosphere, the
Iranian news agency reported Sunday that Iran's only legalized
opposition party demanded that the government allow opposition
newspapers and provide security needed for open political activity.
   It quoted Ibrahim Yazdi, an official of the Iran Freedom Movement
Party, as saying the opposition group is not opposed to the rule of
the Islamic clergy. ``Provided a free press, freedom of gatherings
and freedom of thought, we will not turn our backs,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   The group said it would participate in any open presidential
elections.
   Montazeri's latest criticism was his strongest, and all the more
telling because it was delivered on the anniversary of the day in
1979 when the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's government collapsed
and Khomeini's revolutionaries took over.
   Speaking about the Iran-Iraq, Montazeri asked a question that a
year ago would have been considered political heresy: ``Did we
succeed in doing well during the imposed war, or did the enemies who
imposed it turn out to be the victors?''
   Hostilities halted Aug. 20 after Iran, battered by a string of
military defeats, accepted a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire a year after
Iraq said it was willing to do so.
   ``We should consider how many people we lost, how many splendid
young men were martyred, how many cities were destroyed. We should
take all these into account, then if we say we have made a mistake,
we should repent,'' Montazeri said.
   ``We used slogans that frightened the world ... Have we succeeded
in protecting the revolution and realizing its objectives? Have we
delivered the promises we gave to the people?''
   His hard-hitting comments follow unusually frank interviews by
other Iranian leaders, including Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani and Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili, in which they
acknowledged that Iran's war strategy was flawed and that U.S.
intervention tipped the scales against Tehran.
   Montazeri's remarks contrasted with a Saturday speech by
President Ali Khamenei to a rally in Tehran, which was long on
praise for the revolution's survival and short on criticism of its
failings.
   Khamenei admitted there were differences in Iran's leadership but
denied a power struggle exists.
   Montazeri touched on one of the points of disagreement by
advocating that Iranians who fled abroad be allowed to return to
help rebuild an economy nearly ruined by the war.
   ``Those abroad are terrified,'' he said, in an apparent reference
to a wave of executions in Iran over the past six months.
   Iranian leaders have admitted some political prisoners have been
executed. Dissident Iranians claim as many as 12,000 people have
been killed. The United Nations and Amnesty International estimate
there have been 1,000 executions.
   ``Set aside past mistakes and harsh treatment. Extremism is to
our detriment. Try to treat (the exiles) with affection and Islamic
behavior,'' Montazeri said.
   Montazeri praised Khomeini's decision last week to pardon all
political prisoners except ``those with sinister intentions,'' a
reference to about 900 considered hard-core opponents.
   ``Filling the prisons will not heal any wounds,'' Montazeri
declared.

<TEXT>
   Rival gangs armed with assault rifles were
involved in several weekend shootings that killed two people,
including a pregnant teen-ager early Sunday, police said.
   Andrea Garrett, 19, of Los Angeles, was shot several times in the
upper torso as she was standing with a group of people outside a
housing project just after midnight, said Detective John Spreitzer.
   Ms. Garrett, who was eight months pregnant, was pronounced dead
at the scene, east of downtown. A 19-year-old man was shot several
times in the back with the same assault rifle that struck Ms.
Garrett and was seriously wounded, Spreitzer said.
   A 26-year-old Los Angeles man also was wounded after being hit
several times with shotgun pellets, Spreitzer said.
   The attack was believed to be part of a narcotics turf war in the
project, said Lt. Sergio Robleto. The assailants, who shouted gang
slogans as they fled the scene, only were described as three males,
the detective said.
   In a drive-by attack on Saturday, Ruben Castro, 22, was struck by
gunfire from a passing car at 5:30 a.m. while sitting in a car with
another person at an intersection in suburban El Monte, said
sheriff's Deputy Dan Cox.
   Castro drove himself to a friend's house where paramedics treated
him before taking him to Greater El Monte Community Hospital, where
he died.
   Earlier Saturday, shots fired from a passing car into a group of
people wounded a 17-year-old boy in the legs, Sgt. Carl Heintz said.
The boy was hospitalized in stable condition.
   A man was wounded in a similar attack Friday night when shots
were fired into a gathering of people in south-central Los Angeles,
Lt. Mike Chambers said. The 18-year-old man was in stable condition.

<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie, born in India to a Moslem family,
has ignited fires of protest among Moslems worldwide with his
prize-winning novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' a story about the
eternal conflict between good and evil.
   The novel takes its name from the verses the Prophet Mohammad
removed from Islam's holy book, the Koran, on grounds they were
inspired by Satan.
   Moslem critics _ whom Rushdie has called fundamentalist
extremists _ say the book is blasphemous and have protested from
London to New Delhi.
   On Sunday, five people died and at least 80 were wounded when
police fired on a crowd of protesters outside a U.S. government
office in Islamabad, Pakistan, who were demanding that the United
States ban the book.
   The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British
TV personality, both passengers who fall from an airliner blown up
by terrorists en route from India to London.
   They are presumed dead but they survive, or are reborn, and take
on the attributes of the angel Gabriel and Satan.
   Rushdie denies that his novel attacks the Islamic religion, which
he says has been of central importance to him all his life. He said
it deals with ``migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love,
death, London and Bombay.''
   He said the disputed passage concerning a prophet living in a
fantastic city of sand which dissolves when water falls upon it,
happens in a dream -- ``the fictional dream of a fictional character
... and one who is losing his mind at that. How much further from
history could one get?''
   The novel was first published in Britain in September and got
generally good reviews but it was banned in India and some Arab
countries. Moslem religious leaders in Britain condemned it as a
``deliberate attack on a faith and its founders.''
   Moslems threatened to boycott bookshops stocking it and some
shops, frightened by demonstrators, removed it from their shelves.
   British writers protested the attacks and playwright Tom
Stoppard, poet Stephen Spender and novelist Kingsley Amis were among
a number who cabled Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi protesting at
the ban.
   In November, the book won the ``new novel'' category in the
annual literary competition sponsored by the Whitbread brewing
giant, but it did not win the overall Whitbread prize, which went in
January to a first novel by another writer.
   The Guardian, London's liberal daily, on Monday quoted Rushdie as
saying he was ``very upset'' at the deaths in Islamabad on Saturday
and he felt that leaders of Pakistan's religious parties were
whipping up emotion.
   Rushdie was quoted as saying: ``The thing that is most disturbing
is that they are talking about a book that doesn't exist. The book
that is worth killing people for and burning flags for is not the
book that I wrote. The people who demonstrated in Pakistan and who
were killed haven't actually read the book because it isn't on sale
there.''
   Rushdie is 41 and a British citizen. He grew up in Bombay, came
to Britain at age 14 and won honors for history studies at Cambridge
University.
   He has six books behind him, including three prize-winning
novels, ``Midnight's Children,'' ``Shame'' and ``The Satanic
Verses,'' and ``The Jaguar Smile'' about his travels in Nicaragua.

   Police fired on hundreds of protesters
Sunday who stormed a U.S. government office to demand the United
States ban a novel they consider offensive to Moslems. At least five
people died and 80 were injured, doctors said.
   Police repeatedly fired semi-automatic weapons, rifles and
shotguns at charging protesters who yelled ``American dogs!'' and
hurled rocks and bricks during three hours of fierce clashes.
   The rioting erupted when more than 2,000 fundamentalists tried to
march to the U.S. Information Center to demand the United States ban
``The Satanic Verses,'' an acclaimed novel by Salman Rushdie.
   Pakistan banned the novel on grounds it offends Moslems by
suggesting the prophet Mohammed was fallible. India also banned the
novel.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, where President Bush was spending the
weekend, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials
were monitoring the Islamabad situation closely. Fitzwater said the
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, telephoned Bush early
Sunday to tell him of the riot.
   ``God is great!'' protesters screamed as they smashed windows and
started fires after driving off scores of police.
   They tore down the American flag at the center and danced in
delight as it was burned, along with effigies representing the
Indian-born Rushdie and the United States. ``Hang Salman Rushdie,''
one man yelled.
   Three U.S. diplomats and 15 Pakistanis employeed at the center
were in the building at the time but were not hurt, U.S. diplomats
said.
   ``There was a pitched battle going on outside,'' said Kent Obee,
head of the center, which contains a public library and dispenses
information about the United States.
   Doctors at area hospitals, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said at least five people had been killed by police gunfire and 65
protesters shot and wounded.
   They said the injured included Moslem theology students and about
20 police hit by rocks or beaten by the rampaging crowd.
   Police arrested at least 65 protesters, and angry officers were
seen beating and kicking some of those arrested. Hospitals reported
at least 80 injuries.
   Some protesters attacked the nearby American Express travel
agency, smashing windows and starting a fire before police drove
them off.
   Enraged demonstrators also attacked three Western journalists,
including two Associated Press correspondents and an Atlanta
Constitution correspondent. They were not injured.
   Police in blue helmets and armed with bamboo canes and metal
shields initially tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas and
batons, but the mob hurled the tear gas canisters back and
repeatedly charged police.
   Police fired in the air and then began shooting into the crowd as
protesters advanced. Other officers ran to escape the mob.
   Protest leaders said ``The Satanic Verses'' should be banned in
the United States and all other nations.
   ``There are insulting remarks in this book. There are lies in
this book,'' said Mohammad Sadique.
   The novel takes its name from the verses the Prophet Mohammad
removed from Islam's holy book, the Koran, on grounds they were
inspired by Satan.
   The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British
TV personality, both passengers who fall from an airliner blown up
by terrorists en route from India to London.
   They are presumed dead but they survive, or are reborn, and take
on the attributes of the angel Gabriel and Satan.
   Rushdie, who lives in London, denies that his novel attacks the
Islamic religion, which he says has been of central importance to
him all his life. He said it deals with ``migration, metamorphosis,
divided selves, love, death, London and Bombay.''
   He said a disputed passage concerning a prophet living in a
fantastic city of sand which dissolves when water falls upon it,
happens in a dream _ ``the fictional dream of a fictional character
... and one who is losing his mind at that. How much further from
history could one get?''
   The novel was first published in Britain in September.
   Obee said the U.S. Embassy had been informed about the march and
that officials expected protest leaders to present a petition asking
that the United States ban the book. Police had been stationed
around the center for hours before the march.
   Some opposition lawmakers and Moslem leaders said police
overreacted and mishandled the situation.
   ``It was a very brutal attack against a peaceful demonstration,''
they said in a joint statement.

   Leftist guerrillas on Sunday claimed
responsibility for launching an attack outside the presidential
palace and setting off a bomb at a university.
   There were no reports of injuries and the palace was not damaged,
but the campus explosion shattered windows and destroyed furniture.
   The pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, which claimed
responsibilty in phone calls to local newspapers, left flyers near
the campus explosion demanding guarantees that their military
leader, Victor Polay, not be harmed.
   Polay was captured Feb. 3 in Huancayo, an Andean city 140 miles
east of Lima.
   The newspaper Expreso said in its Sunday edition that attackers
fired four grenades at the Government Palace on Saturday night. It
said three of the four grenades exploded in the air and the fourth
hit the roof of the building that houses the offices and residence
of President Alan Garcia.
   Police denied grenades were fired. They said a strong blast was
heard in a nearby zone of the palace called Polvos Azules. Security
forces exchanged gunfire with three men who fled in the night.
   Shortly after the explosion, policemen and soldiers surrounded
the palace, blocking the streets to vehicles and pedestrians.
   An hour after the incident, dynamite exploded in a building of
the Garcilazo de la Vega University, a block away from the U.S.
ambassador's residence in one of the main avenues of the city.
   The Government Palace have been attacked five times in the last
seven years, but no injuries or severe damage have resulted.
   The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement has been active in Peru
since 1984. In November 1987, Polay led a guerrilla group in a
jungle region northeast of Lima.

<HEAD>Money Magazine Index Shows Investors Removing Money From Thrifts</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release at 6:30 p.m. EST; Time set by source.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small investors removed funds from the nation's
banking system _ particularly savings and loans _ at the rate of $6
billion a week late last month, according to information gathered
for an investment survey.
   Since early January, investors pulled nearly $19 billion from
commercial banks and thrifts, according to data provided to Money
magazine for its Small Investor Index.
   Savings and loans lost 2.5 percent of their savings and
money-market account assets, the survey found. Much of this money
flowed to money-market funds offered by mutual fund companies and
brokerages, the magazine said.
   The magazine said the investors' actions are driven by several
factors:
   _A fear that they might not see their money for weeks or months
should their savings and loan fail.
   _Concern that federal action to bail out the troubled thrift
industry could end up hurting small savers.
   _The belief that banks and thrifts will pay lower yields in the
future after the closure of weak savings and loans that paid
extremely high rates to lure cash.
   _The higher rates of return being offered by money-market mutual
funds.
   On Friday, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported that savings
and loan customers withdrew a record $8.1 billion from their
accounts in December.
   It was the eighth consecutive month of net withdrawals from the
thrifts, the bank board said.

<HEAD>Parties Disputing Nuclear Plant To Meet On Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parties involved in the dispute over the Long
Island Lighting Co. and its idle Shoreham nuclear power plant spent
Sunday pondering a federal judge's ruling and a proposed settlement
that may finally end the debate.
   ``There are lots of things to think about,'' said Judith Vladeck,
an attorney representing Lilco ratepayers, who was in her Manhattan
office Sunday going over the weekend's developments with her clients.
   On Saturday, U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein threw out a
$22.8 million judgment against Lilco, saying the case involving
electricity rates belonged before the state Public Service
Commission, not the courts.
   On Monday, the parties were scheduled to gather in Weinstein's
chambers to review a settlement outlined Saturday by a federal
mediator that would close the $5.4 billion Shoreham plant on Long
Island, which has never operated commercially.
   Suffolk County officials also planned to meet Monday to consider
appealing Weinstein's ruling.
   ``I'm quite confident that it is in the interest of all the
parties to settle this case (Monday),'' the mediator, Kenneth R.
Feinberg, said Sunday.
   Feinberg said the settlement calls for the shutdown of Shoreham
and a $400 million reduction in Lilco's planned rate increases over
the next 10 years.
   The settlement would take effect if Gov. Mario Cuomo approves it
within 15 days of its approval by Lilco and Suffolk County.
   The financially troubled utility company and Cuomo declined
comment on the proposed settlement; a spokesman for Suffolk County
Executive Patrick Halpin expressed cautious acceptance.
   Under a similar settlement proposed by the governor last year,
the state would have bought Shoreham for $1 and closed it; Lilco was
to get annual rate increases of about 5 percent. The proposal was
criticized as too expensive to ratepayers and it died when the
Legislature failed to act on it.
   Feinberg's proposal reduces the proposed increases by about $400
million and contains provisions to settle a lawsuit by Lilco against
the town of Brookhaven, which the utility says overassessed Shoreham
by more than $500 million.
   Weinstein's ruling came more than two months after a federal jury
found that Lilco had lied to obtain rate increases to help pay for
Shoreham. The verdict exposed Lilco to the possibility of a
class-action suit that could have resulted in billions of dollars in
damages.
   Though he allowed the trial to continue, Weinstein ruled Saturday
that the issue should not be decided in federal court under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
   ``What the trial proved ... was that RICO cannot, and should not,
be applied in a case such as this to permit a federal jury in a
civil case to second guess the ratemaking authority of the state,''
Weinstein ruled.
   Construction on the Shoreham plant, 60 miles east of Manhattan,
began in 1973 and it was largely finished a decade later.
   But legal objections to the plant were raised by state and local
governments and many Long Island residents, who contend they could
not safely evacuate the area should there be a plant emergency. The
delays pushed the cost of Shoreham to $5.4 billion, more than 70
times the original estimate.
   The dispute has taken LILCO to the brink of bankruptcy several
times.

   Major American steel companies are spending
millions of dollars to try to document alleged unfair trading
practices by leading steel-exporting nations.
   The move is part of a campaign by the American steel industry to
win an extension of a series of pacts that set product-by-product
limits on the amount of foreign steel that can be shipped into the
United States.
   The pacts were negotiated by the Reagan administration with
Japan, South Korea, Brazil and other nations in 1984 in response to
complaints by American steelmakers that they could not compete with
a flood of subsidized, foreign imports.
   The agreements expire Sept. 30, and USX Corp., Bethlehem Steel
Corp. and other leading steelmakers want to be certain they are
renewed. The Bush administration has pledged to support the pacts,
although no specifics have been offered on whether they would be
continued in their present form.
   The wild cards in the negotiations will be the nations
themselves. They are under no obligation to restrict their imports
again, as they did voluntarily five years ago.
   In order to pressure the trading partners, American steelmakers
have been paying millions of dollars to lawyers to compile ``unfair
trading cases'' against the countries, according to USX and
Bethlehem executives.
   In the cases, the lawyers are detailing allegations of foreign
government subsidies to steelmakers and ``dumping,'' or selling
products in the United States at below fair-market value.
   The unfair trading cases may never actually be filed with the
U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent agency with
authority to order tariffs or other import relief for injured
domestic industries.
   But the American companies are compiling the cases anyway so the
United States can use the information as leverage in negotiations.
   Trade cases are ``an alternative, an expensive undesirable
alternative,'' Robert Boni, chief executive officer of Armco Inc.,
said in a recent interview.
   While steel industry officials are reluctant to publicly discuss
the specifics of such cases, Boni said Armco, of Parsippany, N.J.,
spent $2 million recently just on lawyers who are compiling them. He
said larger steelmakers probably were spending more.
   Under the five-year trade pacts, imports have been reduced from
26.4 percent of the American steel market in 1984 to about 20.5
percent last year. Meanwhile, employment levels and profit among
U.S. steelmakers were up last year over 1987.
   While U.S. steelmakers say they continue to need the protection
of import curbs, some other American manufacturers contend the
restraints have created steel shortages in the United States and
driven up prices.

<HEAD>PaineWebber Announces Agreement To Form Transportation Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PaineWebber Inc. announced Sunday an agreement
under which its transportation group, which provides investment
banking services to the airline and aerospace industry, will become
a separate corporation that will retain ties to the Wall Street firm.
   As part of the agreement, PaineWebber will provide approximately
32 percent of the new corporation's $10 million in equity capital
and will work jointly with The Transportation Group on public
offerings, placements of high-yield, or ``junk bond,'' securities,
and other transactions for the airlines and aerospace industries,
officials said.
   In 1988, PaineWebber's transportation division completed 50
transactions representing more than $3 billion in financing for 27
clients worldwide, PaineWebber said in a statement.
   ``Through this entity there is a real opportunity to expand our
client base and revenue stream,'' said Joseph J. Steuert, chief
executive officer of the new group. Steuert has been a managing
director of PaineWebber and director of its transportation group
since 1984.
   Steuert said he and the approximately 20 other PaineWebber
employees who decided to form the new company wanted the opportunity
to invest their own funds in the transportation group.
   He also said they were motivated by the desire to enter
investment areas that are not part of the traditional businesses of
PaineWebber, such as fund and money management for institutional
investors.
   PaineWebber is one of Wall Street's largest investment firms,
with both individual and institutional clients.
   Last month, PaineWebber reported sharply lower earnings for the
fourth quarter of 1988 and for the year as a whole. It said the
results reflected a slowdown in the financial markets and one-time
costs.
   The company's fouth-quarter profit was $512,000, down 93 percent
from the $7 million in the same period of 1987. For all of 1988,
profit dropped 41 percent to $42.4 million, compared with $72
million in 1987.
   Revenue for 1988 totaled $2.51 billion, up from $2.44 billion in
1987.
   The company said it would continue a program to boost
profitability by reducing support staff, consolidating offices and
shrinking marginal businesses.
   A company spokesman could not be reached Sunday to comment on the
Transportation Group agreement.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Higher, Stock Prices Fall In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar started the trading week substantially
higher against the Japanese yen on Monday, while stock prices
declined.
   The dollar opened at 128.60 yen, up 0.95 yen from Friday's close
of 127.65 yen.
   A rise in prime lending rates by many American commercial banks
and the news of a higher-than-expected U.S. producer price index for
January, both announced on Friday, combined to spur the dollar's
rally, said a dealer from the Bank of Tokyo.
   The dealer, who spoke anonymously, said the report showing the
nation's producer price index for finished goods rose 1 percent last
month was ``stunning news.''
   Also Friday, numerous banks in the United States raised their
prime lending rates from 10.5 percent to 11 percent.
   The rate is closely watched because bankers use it as a basis for
calculating interest on corporate loans and for determining various
types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including home
equity loans.
   Higher U.S. interest rates tend to make the dollar more
attractive to foreign investors.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which closed at a record 32,131.99 points on
Friday, lost 179.91 points, or 0.55 percent, shortly after the
market opened to move to 31,952.08.

<HEAD>Newspaper: S&amp;L Executives Met Secretly To Discuss Future</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30 Texas savings and loan executives, some
representing thrifts that later failed, met secretly in June 1985 to
discuss ways to continue making deals and keep federal regulators
off their backs, a newspaper reported Sunday
   About 19 thrifts were represented at the Houston meeting,
including 15 that have since failed, been declared insolvent or
closed and merged with other institutions, the Houston Post reported.
   Leonard Thomas of Colonial Savings of Western Kansas, an
executive who attended, told the Post he thought the session was a
``secret meeting.'' Colonial, based in Liberal, Kan., was the only
out-of-state thrift represented.
   ``There was a general concern that if the regulators found out
that all the S&amp;L guys got together they might misconstrue the
situation,'' Thomas said. ``In 1985, there were a lot of scared
people running around.''
   The June 11, 1985, meeting was called by Continental Savings
President David Wylie and Chairman Carroll Kelly in a May 22, 1985,
letter written on Continental Savings stationery. A copy of the
letter was obtained by the Post.
   Continental Savings, based in the Houston suburb of Bellaire,
later failed.
   ``We discovered the letter over a year ago,'' said Rosemary
Stewart, director of enforcement for the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, which regulates savings and loans. ``We turned it over to the
Department of Justice as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.''
   Sources who attended the meeting told the Post that several
issues were discussed, including how to evade loan limits to one
borrower and how to remove delinquent loans and foreclosed real
estate from thrift books by selling them to other thrifts.
   Industry sources familiar with the meeting said the effect of
those actions would have been to move bad loans around to hide them
from regulators and make the thrifts appear to be in better
financial shape than they were.
   Ms. Stewart said such actions could be illegal, depending on the
particular circumstances.
   ``Selling REO (real estate owned) can be perfectly lawful under
certain circumstances, but if they were selling REO (to fool the
regulators), that would be a violation of Federal Home Loan Bank
Board rules and very likely a criminal violation _ willful
misstatement of the books and records,'' she said.
   ``I remember them talking about selling REOs,'' said B.G. Wylie,
former chairman of American Savings and Loan in Lake Jackson and the
father of David Wylie.
   ``If something was done, it was after I left. I don't know
whether any of them got together on the REOs,'' Wylie said.
   Another source who attended said the sale of REOs was discussed,
along with evasion of loan limits and growth limits. Wylie said he
didn't remember anyone at the meeting discussing loan limits to one
borrower.

<HEAD>Conrail Chairman Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard D. Sanborn, chairman, president and
chief executive officer of Conrail, died Sunday. He was 52.
   Sanborn became ill at his Baltimore home and was taken to the
Greater Baltimore Medical Center, where he died at 1:30 p.m., the
Philadelphia-based rail company said. The cause of death was an
apparent heart attack, said Conrail spokesman Sol Renick.
   The board of directors will meet Wednesday to discuss a
successor, the company said.
   Sanborn, who had 27 years of experience in the railroad business,
took over as chairman on Jan. 1 with the retirement of L. Stanley
Crane, who in eight years guided the company from massive losses to
profitability.
   Conrail was formed by Congress in 1976 to reorganize six bankrupt
Northeast railroads, including the Penn Central. After 11 years of
government ownership, Conrail was sold March 26, 1987, for $1.6
billion in the largest public stock offering in U.S. history.
   Conrail's board elected Sanborn president and chief operating
officer when Crane announced his retirement a year ago.
   Before joining Conrail, Sanborn was president and CEO for CSX
Distribution Services Inc., a unit of the railroad holding company
CSX Corp.
   After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1960, Sanborn began
his railroad career with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1961 as
an attorney. He joined Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1972 and
worked his way to president and chief executive officer of Seaboard
System Inc. in 1982.
   He joined CSX as president and chief executive in 1986.
   Sanborn, a native of Sanbornville, N.H., graduated from the
University of New Hampshire in 1957.
   He is survived by his wife, Hilda Joan, two children and his
father.
