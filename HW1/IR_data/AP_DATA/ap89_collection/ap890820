   A snake handler died shortly after he was
bitten by a rattlesnake Sunday at the Silver Springs nature park in
North Florida, authorities said.
   Curtis Davison, 22, of Ocala was bitten on the top of his right
hand as he transferred a six-foot Eastern diamondback rattlesnake
from one cage to another, said Mike Jacobs, director of operations
at Silver Springs, about 25 miles southeast of Gainesville.
   Jacobs said the incident occurred in a back area of the park away
from tourists.
   Davison, who was preparing to clean the cages, was pronounced
dead at 1:19 p.m. at Munroe Regional Medical Center in Ocala, a
hospital supervisor said.
   Jacobs said it is the first snake bite death at Silver Springs
since he joined the attraction in 1973. Employees have been bitten
by snakes and recovered, he said.
   The Eastern diamondback is one of the most poisonous snakes in
the world. Its main habitat ranges from Florida to North Carolina to
Louisiana.

   Prime Minister-designate Tadeusz Mazowiecki
came to Solidarity's birthplace Sunday and told 10,000 cheering
Poles not to lose faith as he tries to form the East bloc's first
government led by non-Communists.
   The Communist Party's Central Committee released a resolution
Sunday that threatened to withhold its support for the new
government unless agreement was reached on ``its program platform
and political structure, which should take place before the premier
is appointed.''
   It demanded the party be given the number of Cabinet seats that
``correspond to its state and political potential'' and added:
``Otherwise we will not be able to take responsibility for the
course of developments.''
   The official PAP news agency published the resolution and said it
was adopted at a Central Committee meeting Saturday.
   Mazowiecki met Sunday with Solidarity chief Lech Walesa and other
leaders of the independent movement to begin the task of creating a
government facing disastrous economic problems and the delicate
political situation.
   Mazowiecki expects to decide by the end of the month how the
government ministries will be divided among Solidarity, its two
small-party allies _ The United Peasant Party and Democratic Party _
and the Communists, a spokesman said.
   The Communists will continue to wield power through President
Wojciech Jaruzelski, who nominated Mazowiecki as prime minister
Saturday. The president will formally submit the nomination to the
Sejm, or lower house of the National Assembly, on Monday, but no
action is expected until Wednesday. Confirmation is all but assured.
   The Central Committee resolution denounced the Peasant and
Democratic parties and said they ``bear the burden of historical
responsibility'' for switching allegiance to Solidarity.
   Even before Mazowiecki's nomination the Communists were promised
the ministries of defense and interior, which control the army and
police. But the resolution indicated the party would demand more.
   It also stressed Poland's membership in the Warsaw Pact military
alliance and the Comecon economic treaty between East-bloc
countries. Solidarity has said it would not undermine the Warsaw
Pact.
   Four decades of control by the Communists have ended with the
success of a movement founded by Walesa and backed by Poles such as
Mazowiecki, who was imprisoned by Jaruzelski after the martial-law
crackdown to suppress Solidarity in December 1981.
   Solidarity took some time Sunday to celebrate.
   ``Poland is alive,'' Mazowoiecki proclaimed, invoking the
national anthem which begins: ``Poland has not yet perished, so long
as we're alive.''
   Walesa told the crowd: ``This is our greatest achievement'' since
the Communists took power after World War II.
   Mazowiecki, who edits Solidarity's weekly newspaper in Warsaw,
drove with an associate to Gdansk in his red compact car. They
attended Mass in the packed St. Brygida's church.
   Then Mazowiecki and Walesa spoke from the rectory steps at the
church near the Lenin Shipyard where Solidarity began in 1980.
   ``Today when we open this historic chapter, we must reject a
feeling of hopelessness and helplessness,'' Mazowiecki said. ``We
can do it. I believe that we can do it.''
   There was a small group of anti-Walesa demonstrators in the
crowd, who chanted, ``We need bread, not a premier.''
   ``I know we need bread more than a premier,'' Mazowiecki
answered. Walesa asked for a show of hands of who was with him and
who was against. Support was overwhelming.
   The two then met with the leadership of Solidarity and its
parliament caucus.
   ``We are going to wake up initiative in Poland and lead to a
situation where marketizing the economy is not connected with the
decrease of living standards,'' Mazowiecki said afterward.
   It is clear that Solidarity will renew its appeals to the West
for financial assistance.
   ``We will ask for greater help from both internal and external
forces so that this undertaking by Solidarity can bring greater
effects,'' Walesa said. ``Otherwise it is going to be bad.''
   Asked about the composition of the new government before the
meeting, Mazowiecki said only, ``I have been thinking about it but
it is very tentative.''
   Among the economic difficulties facing the new leaders are
widespread shortages, more than 100 percent inflation, a $39 billion
foreign debt and unprofitable and outmoded industries.
   It was the Communist government's inability to resurrect the
economy and control social tension that led it to negotiate with
Solidarity after years of trying to obliterate the East's bloc's
first legal independent trade union.
   The talks led to the bloc's freest legislative elections ever and
Solidarity's overwhelming victory. The legislature elected
Jaruzelski president without a vote to spare. But Solidarity refused
to join a Communist-controlled government and instead Walesa put
together a coalition with a parliamentary majority.

   A couple who became engaged over dinner at
an inn here wanted to be married at the same spot, but their romance
tripped over the state line.
   The couple's marriage license was issued in New York state, and
they became engaged at a table on the Massachusetts side of the
Swiss Hutte Inn.
   ``The groom was all for going ahead in Massachusetts, but the
bride wondered if the ceremony would actually be legal,'' innkeeper
Cynthia Alper said. So the wedding party put sentiment aside and
stepped over the border.
   Folks in this Berkshire Hills town of 1,300 people, just across
the line from the New York towns of Hillsdale and Copake and 12
miles from Connecticut, are used to coping with different
jurisdictions. The Catamout Ski Resort, just down the road from the
inn, is spread over both New York state towns as well as Egremont.
   Managing the Swiss Hutte Inn was more complicated when the two
states had differing drinking ages.
   But now all Mrs. Alper has to cope with are two sets of property
and other taxes, two sets of permits and inspectors from both
Massachusetts and New York. The inn has four tables and an outside
patio in Massachusetts and 12 tables in New York.
   ``It's something that gets people's attention and they like to
talk bout it,'' Mrs. Alper said. ``But outside of some amusing
incidents, like last Saturday's wedding, it really doesn't cause a
great deal of problems.''
   She is, however, trying to get a Massachusetts telephone listing.
The phone is now on the New York side of the restaurant, so it is a
toll call to telephone anywhere else in Egremont.

<TEXT>
   Three teen-age boys were being held
without bond Saturday on charges they killed a man by beating him
and leaving him unconscious on railroad tracks, where he was run
over by a train.
   A Pasco County grand jury on Friday indicted Ray Martin, 14, of
Dade City, his cousin Christopher Henry Kelly, 15, of Lacoochee and
his friend Kimboy Partain, 15, of Lacoochee on murder charges.
   The three will be tried as adults, county Sheriff Jerry Palladino
said.
   They are accused of beating William Downing, 47, unconscious with
rocks and their fists, robbing him and leaving him to die on the
tracks July 28.
   The boys told sheriff's detectives that they placed Downing on
the tracks sometime before 3 a.m., when a 156-car CSX freight train
traveling about 42 mph hit him.
   Sheriff's reports show Downing called the sheriff's office an
hour before his death, complaining that three drunken people were
harassing him.
   The night after he was found dead, the boys went swimming at
Withlacoochee State Park with the victim's brother, Benny, and his
family.
   ``I know these boys,'' said Benny Downing. ``They ain't the
Sunday school type of kid. They've been around.
   ``They come to your own house, eat your own groceries, play with
your young ones, then do something like that _ that's what I call
cruel,'' he said.
   New Port Richey is 20 miles northwest of Tampa.

   An explosion ripped open a Manhattan street
Saturday, spewing steam high into the air, killing two people,
injuring at least 26 others and prompting the evacuation of hundreds
of residents, officials said.
   ``The whole street is broken up and there is steam pouring into
the sky like a geyser in a national park,'' said Efrain Parrilla, a
Fire Department spokesman at the scene.
   The 6:30 p.m. blast on 20th Street near Third Avenue in the
exclusive Gramercy Park neighborhood apparently occurred when
underground pipes carrying steam to buildings broke, said
Consolidated Edison Co. spokesman Martin Gitten. Con Ed workers had
been working on a steam line.
   A man and a woman were pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital
Center, said hospital administrator Peter Schectman. The two
suffered multiple injuries, Schectman said. No other details on the
dead were available.
   Fire officials initially said two Con Ed workers had been killed,
but Gitten later said all utility workers at the site were alive and
accounted for. Four Con Ed workers were among the injured.
   The injuries suffered by the workers and at least 22 other people
included severe burns, shock and minor cuts and bruises, said
Emergency Medical Service spokeswoman Lynn Shulman.
   One of those injured was a taxi driver who apparently hurt his
knees when the explosion threw his cab out of control, Schectman
said.
   The blast strewed debris along the street. Steam roared at least
15 stories into the air an hour after the explosion, and continued
to hiss out of the ground at a slower rate until 10:30 p.m., when it
was shut off.
   Officials closed businesses and evacuated people from nearby
buildings, including an 18-story apartment building next to the
explosion site. Broken windows could be seen at least 11 stories up.
   ``We believe we have all the people in the exposed buildings down
now,'' said Assistant Fire Chief William Feehan. ``We have some on
the roof, but they are safe.''
   People remained out of their homes late Saturday, although Gitten
said further damage was unlikely. The Red Cross provided emergency
shelter to 20 people, said spokeswoman Jennifer Hassan.
   Some merchants fled without locking the doors to their
businesses, but police patroled to prevent looting.
   People said they were rocked by the blast.
   ``Everything around here shook,'' said Richard DiPierri, who
works at a restaurant about four blocks away. ``It sounded like a
jet engine roar.''
   ``I grabbed my cat and ran out,'' said resident Rick Vandever.
``I saw people running down the street.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch rushed to the scene.
   One injured Con Ed worker was in fair condition at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center with burns and injuries to his head
and chest, said Linda Franklin, a hospital administrator.
   A man who suffered burns to his back and the cab driver were in
stable condition at Bellevue, Schectman said. The other injured were
taken to other hospitals, Shulman said.
   Gitten said Con Ed crews were trying to isolate the cause of the
blast, which occurred on the same block where a water main break was
reported Saturday morning.
   The 24-inch pipe that blew up carries pressurized steam that gets
as hot as 400 degrees, Gitten said.
   Large pipes under streets throughout lower Manhattan carry steam
to about 2,000 customers, Gitten said.
   ``It is an old technology, but you'll find it in a lot of major
cities. We've seen a growth in our steam system in the last few
years,'' Gitten said. ``A lot of new buildings are opting to take
steam.''

<TEXT>
   A majority of women believe U.S. society has not
changed enough to let women compete with men on an equal basis,
according to a New York Times poll.
   According to the survey published in the newspaper's Sunday
editions, 56 percent of the women polled said equality had not been
achieved and 49 percent of the men surveyed agreed.
   Among female baby-boomers between the ages of 30 and 44, 62
percent of those surveyed agreed with the statement, ``Most men are
willing to let women get ahead, but only if women do all the
housework at home.''
   The poll was based on telephone interviews with 1,025 women and
472 men from June 20-25, with a few questions repeated July 25-30 to
check for the effect of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision permitting
states to put limits on abortion. The poll had a margin of error of
3 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that amount in
either direction.
   Thirty-three percent of the women and 37 percent of the men
surveyed said children's needs are slighted the most when a woman
combines a job with marriage and motherhood, the Times said.
   Substantial majorities of married women surveyed said they do
most of the food shopping, cooking, house cleaning, bill paying and
child care, the poll found.
   But men agreed that their spouses do more around the house and
about half conceded that women do more than their fair share of
household chores, the Times said.
   Three-fifths of the women interviewed said that men's attitudes
toward women have improved in the last two decades. Only half the
women surveyed five years ago said the same.
   Only half of the women between ages 18 and 29 agreed that ``men
still run almost everything and usually don't include women when
important decisions are made,'' the Times said.

<HEAD>Leningrad Communist Party Holds Emergency Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leningrad's Communist Party, stung by the defeat of
most of its leaders in parliamentary elections in March, opened an
``emergency meeting'' Saturday to write a new political program,
Tass reported.
   The Soviet news agency quoted Boris Gidaspov, recently named
party chief of the Leningrad region, as saying, ``The time of
hesitation has passed, people are tired of empty words.''
   Tass said Gidaspov addressed the meeting attended by 1,500
delegates.
   The party apparatus in the country's second-largest city was one
of the big losers in the elections, with voters rejecting virtually
all of the leaders who ran for the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Regional party boss Yuri F. Solovlev ran unopposed but still
failed to get the required approval of more than 50 percent of the
vote.
   Solovlev retired last month at a meeting of the Leningrad party's
Central Committee that was attended by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev who said the party throughout the country was lagging
behind public demands for reform.
   Gidaspov, who succeeded Solovlev, told the delegates Saturday
``the party will lose its influence if it does not prove by actions
its organizing role in restructuring, and if restructuring does not
eventually improve the life of every individual.''
   Restructuring, or ``perestroika'' in Russian, is the name given
to Gorbachev's 4-year-old drive for economic and social change.
   Tass said the Leningrad meeting was being televised live in the
city of 5 million people and the public was invited to attend.
   It said telephone lines were set up at the meeting to receive
people's quetions and comments. The meeting will continue Sunday and
``everybody will be given the floor,'' Tass said.

<HEAD>Meeting Fails To Bring Agreement On Indian Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Smithsonian Institution official met with
Indian leaders this week to discuss the handling of the remains of
Indian ancestors, but no agreement was reached, a Smithsonian
spokeswoman said Saturday.
   Indian leaders want the remains returned to them. Museums and
universities throughout the country argue, however, that the bones
are vital to research.
   Leslie Logan of the Smithsonian's Office of Public Affairs said
Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams met Thursday with Rep. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., and Suzan Harjo, executive director of
the National Congress of American Indians, to discuss the issue.
   There was some movement, but not enough to announce a settlement
Saturday as hoped, Logan said.
   During a reception for about 650 people at the Wheelwright Museum
of the American Indian in Santa Fe, Adams announced plans for a
national museum for the American Indian, to be located in Washington.
   If approved, construction on the $175 million museum would begin
in 1992.
   But the issue of returning to tribes some of the 35,000 skeletons
and other sacred objects held by the Smithsonian was not raised
during the reception.
   The issue of the remains was taken up during a meeting this week
in Albuquerque of the National Congress of American Indians.
   The group estimates the bones of 2.5 million Indians are held in
public and private collections nationwide. Museum spokesmen dispute
the figure, estimating institutions hold the remains of 100,000 to
250,000.
   Museums and universities study the bones to learn more about the
bone structure, diseases and lifestyles of American Indians more
than 100 years ago.
   Tribes are pressuring the museums and universities to return the
bones so they can be properly buried.
   Campbell said Indian support for a National Museum of the
American Indian is mixed. He said settling disputes between the
tribes and the Smithsonian over the remains is crucial if the
Smithsonian wants Indians' support.
   ``We have to deal with the bones issue,'' said Campbell, who
sponsored the bill to fund the museum. ``A directive for the
Smithsonian to work with the tribes to settle it is included in the
bill.''
   Adams described the proposed museum as, ``a flagship of American
cultural diversity.''
   ``It is only natural that it should be Indian-led and, hence, it
will have a special sensitivity in its presentation of the spiritual
and symbolic dimension of American Indian history. But the museum is
not a commemoration of the past. It is a celebration bridging the
past, present and future.''
   Herman Agoyo, director of the All Indian Pueblo Council, a
coalition of New Mexico pueblos, said the bill to begin planning _
and to push the Smithsonian to settle the bones issue _ has the
council's full support.
   ``We look forward to actively participating,'' he said. ``For the
first time, we will not be sitting on the outside looking in.''

<TEXT>
   Bell of Pennsylvania reached agreement with
electrical workers late Saturday to settle one of the phone strikes
involving about 200,000 workers around the country.
   The company said the tentative agreement with the 1,938 members
of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers called for a
7.5 percent pay increase over the three-year contract, a profit
sharing plan and a new health care arrangement intended to hold down
costs.
   But IBEW workers will not return to work until Bell of
Pennsylvania settles local issues with the striking Communications
Workers of America, which is also on strike, and an agreement is
reached between the IBEW and New Jersey Bell, said Bell of
Pennsylvania spokesman Al Butkus.
   The CWA has been striking Bell Atlantic, the parent company for
the region, in West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C.
   Bell Atlantic reached an agreement Thursday with the CWA but the
41,000 members it represents in the region will not return to work
until they complete negotiations with their respective local
companies.
   Bell Atlantic is one of four regional ``Baby Bell'' phone
companies in 20 states and the District of Columbia being struck by
nearly 200,000 operators, clerks, technicians and other workers.
   The other regional companies are Pacific Telesis, which covers
California and Nevada; NYNEX, serving New York and the Northeast,
and Ameritech, which covers five Midwestern states.
   Wages and employee contributions to health-insurance plans have
been major issues blocking settlement of the strikes.
   In Albany, N.Y., meanwhile, New York Telephone said the company
had discovered at least ten telephone lines cut or burned Saturday
around the state and in Connecticut, but said it could not confirm
the vandalism was linked to a two-week strike by its employees.
   Spokesman Pete Muller said about 4,200 lines were out because of
the vandalism.
   New York Telephone is a subsidiary of NYNEX, which has about
60,000 workers on strike.
   The striking workers include operators, telephone installers and
repairmen, factory workers and some sales and clerical personnel.
All four regional companies have continued service using management
personnel, but there have been delays for installation and operator
services.

   A riverboat carrying about 150 people on a
late-night cruise collided with a barge and sank early Sunday in the
River Thames. Several people drowned, up to 40 were unaccounted for
and 98 were hospitalized, authorities said.
   London Fire Brigade said several bodies were removed from the
river, but it declined to specify how many. One was recovered near
Hammersmith Bridge, some 8 miles away, Scotland Yard said.
   The Marchioness pleasure cruiser was struck by a dredging barge
near Blackfriars Bridge shortly before 2 a.m. (9 p.m. EDT Saturday)
and sank within two minutes, said police Inspector Howard Neil.
   It was not immediately clear if the barge had been plying the
river, and news reports speculated it had come loose from its
riverside mooring.
   Scores of people were disco dancing below deck when the collision
occurred, news reports said. Survivors said the boat had been
privately chartered for a birthday party and that most people on
board were in their 20s.
   ``There are reports of up to 40 people still in the river,''
Scotland Yard said before daybreak. ``The final outcome will depend
on how many people were board.''
   Estimates of the number of people on board varied from under 100
to as many as 150. Ken Dewan, owner of Tidal Cruisers, the pleasure
boat charter company that operated the riverboat, was helping police
to determine the exact number, officials said.
   It was not immediately known if any Americans were on the boat.
   Dozens of passengers swam to safety, and 98 people were taken to
Westminster and St. Thomas' hospitals, nearly all suffering minor
injuries, the ambulance service said. Some survivors were treated
for shock at The Savoy, the exclusive riverside hotel.
   Some people were swept hundreds of yards down river to Waterloo
Bridge, Scotland Yard said.
   Ambulance crews, firefighters and police helped to rescue
passengers from the water, including some people who were swept
hundreds of yards down river to Waterloo Bridge, Scotland Yard said.
   News reports said the barge is normally attached to a buoy on the
side of the river and speculated that it became detached by a strong
tide. One witness said the barge appeared to be unmanned.
   ``The big ship just nudged us and we all thought it was going to
go past. But our boat went down in about 30 seconds,'' said survivor
Piers Allen.
   ``I had been standing on the front of the deck with many other
people,'' he told Sky Television. ``We were jettisoned into the
water. It was very, very frightening. People were screaming and
shouting and holding on to pieces of wood.''
   ``People were inside dancing and we were out on the front,'' said
Rod Lay, 29. ``Suddenly the boat lurched to the side, everyone fell
about, and there was this huge ship right behind us.
   ``Suddenly it rammed again, and the whole thing was run over, and
we were underneath the water,'' he said.
   The accident occurred less than 1 mile from the Houses of
Parliament.
   Firefighters scanned the river with high-powered searchlights,
but only small pieces of wreckage could be seen. Dozens of fire
engines and ambulances stood by on the embankments.
   ``I saw a young bloke of about 22 crying his eyes out,'' said
taxi driver Osman Tuncbuker. ``He said there were 50 people on the
top deck.
   ``The boat went down within two minutes of being hit,'' he said.
``He told me he looked round and could only see the people in the
water who had been on the deck. Apparently his brother and sister
had been below deck and he could not find them. He feared they were
missing.''
   The last major disaster involving a British ship was the sinking
of the car and passenger ferry Herald of Free Enterprise, which

   Assailants threw a grenade into a
crowd attending a dance in a southern village, killing at least
eight people and wounding 57, officials said Sunday.
   The military said two civilian militiamen were taken into custody
aftter the incident late Saturday in the village of Kidandan in
Santa Maria town, about 640 miles south of Manila.
   Maj. Francisco Arquillano, deputy provincial constabulary
commander of Davao del Sur, said four children were among those
killed when the grenade exploded during the dance and coronation
program for a local beauty queens.
   Regional military authorities flew to the village early Sunday to
investigate, she said.

   Torrential rains flooded streets
Sunday in the Philippine capital and triggered landslides in the
northern mountains. At least four people died, officials said.
   Heavy rains began Saturday and continued through the night,
flooding streets throughout the Manila area. Residents of some
districts waded in knee-deep water, carrying belongings to higher
ground.
   There were numerous car accidents, but no deaths were reported.
   In northern Luzon island, heavy rains caused landslides and
washed away portions of highways, officials reported.
   Four people were killed Saturday when boulders loosened by the
rains tumbled down a mountainside and crushed their vehicle near
Baguio, 130 miles north of Manila. Officials said the dead included
one man and a girl, but the identities of the others had not been
determined.

   Evangeline Guico said her marriage
vows Sunday, then sprinkled holy water over her fiance as he lay in
a casket.
   Miss Guico, 21, who is two months pregnant, was to have wed
21-year-old Marlon Manalac on Sept. 26 after a three-year courtship.
But on Tuesday, Manalac was found shot to death by an unknown
assailant in a Manila suburb.
   Manalac's father, police Maj. Alfonso Manalac, decided to go
ahead with the unusual ceremony, which took place at the family
residence.
   A minister of the Aglipayan Church, a Philippine denomination
that broke with Roman Catholicism, agreed to officiate after the
Roman Catholic Church refused to sanction the ``marriage.''
   Manalac's brother stood in for him at the ceremony.
   ``Marlon loves Vangie very much, and we want to pursue his
promise wherever he may be right now,'' Maj. Alfonso Manalac told
reporters.

   A pleasure boat carrying about 120 people sank in
the River Thames early Sunday after it was rammed by a barge and cut
in half. Authorities said several people died, 89 were rescued and
about 30 were missing.
   Scotland Yard first said all seven crew members of the Bowbelle
sand-and-gravel dredging barge were arrested and were being
questioned. But Scotland Yard later said only the captain and second
mate were arrested and that it was questioning the five other crew
members as witnesses.
   The London Fire Brigade said several bodies were recovered from
the river but would not say how many. Scotland Yard confirmed a
woman's body was recovered near Hammersith Bridge, eight miles
upstream from the collision.
   It was not immediately known if any Americans were on the boat
that sank.
   Police said the Marchioness pleasure cruiser, chartered for a
private birthday party, was rammed from behind by the empty barge
shortly before 2 a.m.
   Survivors said the barge struck the boat a second time and then
ran straight over it.
   The Marchioness sank within two minutes in 25 feet of water near
Blackfriars Bridge in central London, police said. Port of London
Authority divers later reported the hull was cut in half.
   The count of victims was complicated by uncertainty over the
number of guests aboard the double-decker Marchioness, built during
World War II. The boat is licensed to carry 149 passengers and two
crew members.
   Police said there were about 120 passengers and crew, and about
30 were still missing 10 hours later. But Ken Dewan, owner of the
Marchioness' company, said only 110 people were aboard. There was no
passenger list.
   ``We believe there were somewhere in the region of 120 people on
board,'' police Commander Tony Speed told a news conference.
``Sadly, we expect more bodies. Given the speed at which the vessel
sank, the time of night, and its location in the Thames, it's quite
remarkable that 89 people survived.''
   Earlier reports that 98 people were hospitalized proved incorrect.
   Transport Minister Michael Portillo said he has ordered an
immediate inquiry by the government's Marine Accidents Investigation
Branch, in addition to the police inquiry.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on holiday in Austria, issued a
statement through her office saying she was ``deeply distressed'' by
the tragedy.
   The 2,000-ton barge, owned by Ready Mixed Concrete Ltd., is 80
yards long, making it one of the largest vessels registered on the
river.
   Survivors said the pleasure boat was privately chartered by a
modeling agency for a birthday party and most people on board were
in their 20s. The boat was chartered from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m.
   Many of those dancing on the top deck of the Marchioness jumped
or were thrown overboard. Others, dancing below deck, were trapped.
   Dozens of passengers swam to safety, and 89 people were taken to
three hospitals, nearly all suffering minor injuries, police said.
Some people were treated for shock at The Savoy, the exclusive
riverside hotel.
   Ambulance crews, firefighters and police helped to rescue
passengers from the water, Scotland Yard said. A fast-running tide
at dawn temporarily prevented divers from continuing their search.
Police said an attempt to lift the boat might be made Sunday.
   The accident occurred less than one mile from the Houses of
Parliament.
   The last major disaster involving a British ship was the sinking
of the car and passenger ferry Herald of Free Enterprise, which
capsized off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on March 6, 1987, killing
193 people.
   The Darlwyne, another cruise boat, sank off Cornwall in southwest
England in July 1967, and 31 vacationers drowned.

<HEAD>AZT Costs to Patients Put at $2 billion-$5 Billion Yearly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans infected with AIDS may need $2
billion to $5 billion annually to pay for the anti-viral drug AZT
that delays progression of the deadly disease, federal health
officials estimate.
   The Department of Health and Human Services last week expanded by
400,000 the number of AIDS patients eligible for AZT treatment by
declaring its effectiveness among patients whose disease is at an
early stage with no symptoms.
   The drug was already available to an estimated 200,000 patients
with symptoms of AIDS. In the protocol now approved for the drug,
AZT now costs about $8,000 annually for each patient, according to
National Institutes of Health estimates.
   ``You're talking about $5 billion,'' said John Klemm, an analyst
for the federal Health Care Financing Agency. ``It's a huge burden.''
   Also known as zidovudine, AZT is marketed by Burroughs Wellcome
Co. under the brand name Retrovir. It formally was known by the name
azidothymidine, which was shortened in usage to AZT. It is the only
antiviral drug approved to combat the AIDS virus.
   However, one finding of the drug trial announced last week could
relieve some of the expected new financial pressure.
   A third of the patients in the drug trial were given AZT doses of
500 milligrams daily. The regimen called for taking a 100 mg pill
every four hours while awake. The drug was as effective for these
patients as was a higher dose for others in the trial.
   The licensed use of AZT calls for 1,200 mg a day _ two 100 mg
pills every four hours, day and night.
   Dr. Daniel Hoth who directed the drug trial said doctors probably
will now start prescribing the lower doses for their patients.
   This, in effect, would reduce the number of AZT pills taken daily
from 12 to five. Since the pills typically cost $1.84 each, based on
a survey of Washington, D. C. drug stores, the revised dosage would
drop the cost from $22.08 per patient, per day, to $9.20 a day. That
would drop the annual cost per patient from about $8,000 to $3,358.
   In turn, it would drop the national cost of AZT, based on the NIH
estimate of 600,000 patients who could benefit from its use, from
about $5 billion to about $2 billion.
   Activists and patients in the AIDS community hailed the new drug
trial findings as a major advance in the war on the disease. But
almost in the next breath they asked who was going to help these
additional AIDS patients pay for the expensive therapy.
   The announcement, said Jean McGuire, executive director of the
AIDS Action Council, ``highlights the inherent contradictions
between the department's aggressive drug development efforts and its
lackluster pursuit of creative answers to the to the problems of
access and financing.''
   ``Drug development success is meaningless without the assurance
of patient access,'' she added.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., made the same point.
   ``Science has given us the tools to help hundreds of thousands of
people fight for their life _ what is lacking is an equitable
formula for delivering those tools to Americans in need,'' Kennedy
said.
   HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said the new findings from drug
trials developed so fast that officials have not yet mapped out a
plan to help the newly eligible patients pay for AZT treatment.
   Sullivan used his authority to order Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursement drug payments to patients who qualify under those
programs. But Klemm said preliminary studies indicate the few of the
newly eligible patients qualify for Medicare or Medicaid.
   Most patients who test positive for the human immunodeficiency
virus _ HIV _ that causes AIDS but who show no other symptoms of the
disease are young and not disabled, which disqualifies them for
Medicare, he said.
   And many are not poor enough under the poverty tests used by
state-run Medicaid program or do not have the dependents necessary
to qualify. ``If they are working they may have to quit or something
in order to impoverish themselves,'' to become eligible, Klemm said.
   Thomas Sheridan, director of public policy for the AIDS Action
Council, said only 1 percent of Americans infected with HIV are
receiving any benefit from Medicare.
   Sheridan estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of the 200,000
patients with AIDS symptoms are receiving Medicaid reimbursement for
AZT. Most patients, he said, either have medical insurance or pay
for AZT out of their own pocket.
   Insurance companies, said Sheridan, may not pay for AZT for the
group of 400,000 because the drug currently is not licensed for
prescription to HIV-infected patients who are asymptomatic.
   ``Private insurance has been showing an alarmingly uncomfortable
trend toward disallowing payment for drugs based on their unlicensed
status,'' he said. ``AZT is now licensed for patients who have AIDS,
not for people who are only HIV positive.''
   Unless action is taken by the federal government, Sheridan said,
many of the group of 400,000 may have to ``spend themselves into
poverty'' to qualify for Medicaid help on their drug bills.
   Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Foundation for
AIDS Research, said the drug trial findings demonstrate that AIDS
virus infections may now be treatable. This means, he said, that
asymptomatic people who avoided being tested for AIDS, because there
was no treatment until there were symptoms, now have a strong
medical reason to be tested for the virus.
   As a result, he expects there will be flood of patients getting
the AIDS test and finding that they are positive.
   ``I'll be very surprised if this doesn't lead to a significant
increase in the demand for AZT,'' said Silverman. ``It's going to be
very, very costly.''
   Help, he said, will have to come from the federal government
because local and state governments resources for treating
HIV-infected patients already are strained.
   ``Communities are at the breaking point,'' said Silverman. ``New
York City is in gridlock. San Francisco is almost crumbling.''

   A person you've never met, touting a company
you've never heard of tries to sell you a stock you never wanted.
   Sometimes it's an honest broker pushing a low-priced but
high-risk legitimate stock. But often the call is from a
``boiler-room'' bank of telephones staffed by smooth-talking sales
people preying on the anxieties or greed of unsophisticated buyers.
   ``A high pressure salesman might say if you don't buy now, you're
going to miss the boat,'' says Robert Ferri of the National
Association of Securities Dealers. ``The only boat you're going to
miss is the Titanic.''
   The NASD oversees over-the-counter stocks and brokers who deal in
them.
   A rising tide of fraud involving penny stocks _ inexpensive but
risky securities that usually aren't traded on any stock exchanges _
is worrying securities regulators and industry officials across the
country.
   Penny stocks in themselves aren't illegal. But the North American
Securities Administrators Association, a Washington-based
organization of state investment regulators, calls the fraudulent
sale of these securities the biggest threat facing the average
investor.
   Three weeks ago, 14 people and two companies were charged in
Chicago with an alleged $10 million penny stock scam in which the
companies' share prices were artificially raised before being sold
at large profits.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil
complaint that the companies were only shams created to peddle
stock. One company's stock, first offered at 15 cents per share in
1985, rose to a high of $6 per share through announcements of bogus
mergers and other scams that drew in millions of dollars from
investors around the country.
   In Florida earlier this year, state authorities moved to revoke
the license of a Denver-based penny stock brokerage after it
allegedly bilked thousands of investors, including an 80-year-old
woman who lost about $30,000.
   Penny stock fraud is ``the fraud du jour,'' says Lawrence H.
Fuchs, Florida's deputy comptroller.
   ``A disproportionate number of customer complaints about
broker-dealers in our state derive from the penny stock market,''
said John B. Hiatt, director of the New Mexico Securities Division.
   ``I would say it's rapidly coming to the forefront of our
activities,'' said Irwin Fisk, chief investigator for the California
Division of Corporations in Southern California.
   In the 23 years he's been on the job, Fisk said his division had
seen about six penny stock fraud cases. ``We've got that many or
more pending right now, most in the last few months.''
   Officials say the very nature of penny stocks makes them prone to
scam artists.
   Trading for a few cents up to a few dollars, penny stocks usually
are issued by new companies ranging from energy developers to makers
of would-be wonder drugs. They often have an untested or uneven
earnings history.
   Because most penny stocks are not listed nationally, information
about them is hard to obtain and fraudulent claims are difficult to
dispute.
   ``Information is power and you don't have it with penny stocks,''
said Ferri, the NASD spokesman.
   He said unscrupulous brokers offering stocks in unsolicited
telephone calls known as ``cold calling'' might be pushing
legitimate stocks but not for the price at which they are actually
trading. The stocks aren't usually carried in newspaper stock
listings and buyers have no way of knowing their real price.
   Another scam consists of constantly selling stock, buying it back
and selling it again at increasingly higher prices, like a pyramid
scheme, until the last buyers are left holding stocks that are only
worth a fraction of the price they paid.
   The SEC has created a penny stock task force and recently it
approved a rule that will make it impossible for unscrupulous
brokers to conduct penny stock sales with new customers over the
phone.
   The new rule, effective Jan. 1, 1990, requires buyers to approve
the first three transactions with a new broker in writing and
requires the broker to determine the buyer's financial status and
the suitability of the stock purchase.
   Sarah B. Ackerson, an SEC attorney assigned to the task force,
said the agency still is compiling nationwide statistics about penny
stock fraud.
   But she noted that in the first half of the fiscal year, which
will end Sept. 30, the SEC received 2,462 complaints about penny
stock fraud compared with 1,510 for all of last year.
   Regulators and industry officials caution investors to be wary
when considering penny stocks, especially when offered through
unsolicited phone calls.
   ``Hang up on them,'' advises Florida's Fuchs. ``Investigate a
company thoroughly before you commit money.''
   ``I would ask for a prospectus before I bought anything,'' said
California's Fisk.

<TEXT>
   Wooden thumb screws, neck collars, a ball
and chain lie on Joe Sparks' floor, part of his collection of
slavery memorabilia and his research into the life of an escaped
slave who was one of the inspirations for ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.''
   Sparks' unusual collection began in 1967 because of a local story
he read about former slave Josiah Henson. Besides collecting
memorabilia, he has worked to see Henson honored in the western
Kentucky county which he fled in 1830 with his wife and their four
children.
   Sparks, a 60-year-old electrical contractor, led the effort to
have U.S. 60 from Owensboro to the Hancock County line designated in
June by a state marker as the Josiah Henson Trail. The route passes
the site where Henson lived as a slave.
   ``It kind of got me,'' Sparks said of Harriet Beecher Stowe's
novel of slave life, which he read after he became interested in
Henson. The novel, a best-seller when it came out in 1852, has been
credited with fostering anti-slavery sentiment in the decade before
the Civil War. Mrs. Stowe met Henson in 1849 and said that his story
was an inspiration for the novel.
   ``Here was a man who lived here for that period of time and who
became famous because of an internationally famous book,'' Sparks
said.
   He has playbills of productions of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,''
first-edition copies of the novel, comic books and children's
editions of the novel. He also has ownership papers on slaves, and
items of restraint he has picked up at flea markets and through
antique trade magazines.
   `You have to know what you're looking for,'' Sparks said.
   Henson was born into slavery in 1789, and worked on plantations
in Maryland and Kentucky. He was ordained a minister in the
Methodist Episcopal Church in 1828, and earned money preaching to
try to buy his freedom. After he made a down payment of $275 toward
his $400 price, the plantation owner raised the price to $1,000.
   Henson, his wife and children escaped Kentucky in September 1830,
by rowing across the Ohio River. Two weeks later, they walked into
Cincinnati. They reached Canada in October 1830 and eventually
settled in Dresden, Ontario, where Henson became a noted educator
and abolitionist.
   Sparks, president of the Josiah Henson Historical Society in
Owensboro, has proposed developing the old Amos Riley Plantation,
where Henson served as an overseer, as a historic site.
   The plantation house no longer exists on the privately owned
land, and a soybean field covers the ground where Henson's slave
cabin stood, Sparks said. He used old property deeds to map the
boundaries of the plantation, which once encompassed thousands of
acres.
   Slavery, Sparks said, ``was a cruel system, and we would have
been better off without it.'' But he said preserving the plantation
site is important from a historical viewpoint.
   ``It's among the most significant sites in the state of
Kentucky,'' Sparks said. ``We are trying to preserve a part of
history. It's our heritage, and we have to face it.''
   Owensboro Mayor David Adkisson also supports the idea of a
permanent place to honor Henson.
   ``I think it would have to be done with sensitivity in a
historical setting, not in a sensational way or as a commercial
tourist attraction,'' Adkisson said. ``It would be to commemorate
the life of a very courageous black man.
   ``It's unfortunate that the image of `Uncle Tom' has developed in
a way that became a derogatory term about certain black people. The
life of Josiah Henson is a very proud story.''
   Sparks and Adkisson admit that Henson, who died in 1883 in
Dresden, likely would have been surprised to know that two white men
were trying to honor him in the county that he fled.
   ``He probably also would be surprised a park in Dresden, Ontario,
was named for him,'' Adkisson said.
   The park in Ontario is called Uncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site,
said Barbara G. Carter, Henson's great-great-granddaughter, who
manages the site.
   Last year about 10,000 people from all over the world visited the
site, Mrs. Carter said. In September 1983, Canada honored Henson
with a postage stamp, she said.
   ``He is held in very high esteem here,'' Mrs. Carter said.

<HEAD>New Protectionist Battle Looms on Weapons Trade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After working itself into a ``Buy American''
frenzy over co-production of a jet fighter with Japan, Congress
again faces a new protectionism battle over renewing an obscure,
39-year-old law on weapons purchases.
   The Defense Production Act of 1950 gives the president power to
limit or prohibit the acquisition of foreign products. The Korean
War era legislation also gives the government authority to subsidize
industries, including those that produce goods for the Pentagon.
   Nearly four decades later, lawmakers are hoping to use renewal of
the law, which expires Sept. 30, to infuse life into the depressed
U.S. defense industrial base and limit foreign sources for weapons
components.
   The interest in the problems of U.S. defense manufacturers comes
on the heels of a rancorous debate earlier this year over
co-production agreement of the FSX fighter, an advanced version of
the F-16.
   Opponents of the FSX transaction charged that it would ``shut
down American industries'' by handing the Japanese vital U.S.
technology. However, congressional efforts to prevent the
U.S.-negotiated deal or impose conditions failed.
   Next month, defense industry woes and the increasing use of
foreign suppliers for weapons components moves to the forefront
again.
   ``The problem has been a subject of numerous defense, industry,
Government Accounting Office and congressional reviews since the
mid-1970s,'' said Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., a member of both the
Senate Armed Services and Banking committees.
   ``Yet, until recently, little has been done to shape practical
solutions,'' Dixon said last month.
   The Center for Strategic and International Studies found that
from 1982 to 1987 the number of U.S. companies supplying goods to
the Defense Department dropped from 118,000 to 38,000.
   William G. Phillips, president of the National Council for
Industrial Defense, said the Pentagon's reliance on foreign
companies has become a major concern for approximately 5 million
members of labor unions and employees of companies represented by
his group.
   The argument most raised by Phillips and others is that Pentagon
might be unable to get necessary components for its weapons systems
if foreign supplies are cut off.
   ``The general consensus is we are becoming dependent on foreign
sources for some very important pieces of our military hardware,''
Phillips said in an interview last week.
   ``The questions are how dependent, how fast and whether or not
that dependency is leading to a critical vulnerability if we lose
that foreign source,'' he said.
   But former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in congressional
hearings last month cautioned lawmakers that strict protectionist
legislation would ``invite retaliation'' from U.S. trading partners.
   ``It could be disastrous to our national security, if we assume
we can `go it alone' technologically,'' Carlucci said.
   The House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs subcommittee on
economic stabilization is weighing amendments to the law that would
require the president to limit foreign participation in defense
manufacturing and provide financial assistance to medium-size and
small U.S. companies.
   The measure sponsored by Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, would
limit products for new and existing weapons to those from
manufacturers and assembly plants in the United States. The practice
would be phased in over five years.
   If the president decided to waive the U.S.-products only
requirement, the administration would have to report to Congress on
the effect to the U.S. industrial base and detail the costs of
buying overseas.
   The subcommittee approved similar legislation last year but the
bill never made it to the House floor for a vote.
   While the House considers Oakar's measures, the Senate Banking
Committee is weighing legislation sponsored by Dixon aimed more at
internal reform within the Pentagon.
   Specifically, Dixon's measure calls for appointing the defense
secretary to the Economic Policy Council and creating a defense
working group within the council. It also would establish a Defense
Production Act Fund for projects geared to developing new technology.

   Carlito Caparas has spent 11 years
behind bars wondering whether he will ever be convicted or acquitted
of the charge that landed him in jail.
   A first-year college student when he was jailed, Caparas, now 34,
is among thousands of Filipinos who wait for years in jail as their
cases drag through a judiciary system bogged down by inefficiency
and corruption.
   Lack of public confidence in the fair administration of justice
contributes to disillusionment with government and helps fuel the
20-year communist insurgency, military and civilian officials
believe.
   The breakdown in the judiciary has reached such a crisis that
President Corazon Aquino on Friday threatened to fire Justice
Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez and others in his department if they
cannot clear up the mess by the end of the year.
   ``Nothing impairs the credibility of government more than the
common perception that we have two standards of justice, one for the
poor, and another for the rich and powerful,'' she said in the
statement.
   ``I am now placing all of you under probation,'' she said. ``At
the end of the year, we will assess your performance as individuals
and a department. If I am not satisfied, I will not hesitate to
exercise my power to remove appointees.''
   By the end of 1988, more than 15,000 people were in jail
nationwide, government figures show. Of those, 90 percent were
waiting for their trials or appeals to end.
   ``Our jails are bursting at the seams,'' said Brig. Gen. Arsenio
Concepcion, chief of jail management for the Integrated National
Police. ``Therefore, we cannot blame the prisoners if some of them
go crazy.''
   Most recent figures show that more than 300,000 civil and
criminal cases are backlogged in the country's nearly 2,000 courts,
not counting the 9,500 cases pending before the Supreme Court.
   About 350,000 new cases are filed each year. Many take up to 10
years to be resolved. In an effort to clear the docket, overworked
judges often hear cases for only a few minutes then postpone them to
take up anothers.
   The experience of Caparas serves as an example of the slow and
ineffective administration of Philippine justice.
   Caparas claims he was arrested for rape in 1978 after fraternity
brothers used his apartment for sex with a woman. But his trial did
not begin until 1982. At least five judges heard his case before
fire at the Manila City Hall destroyed court records in 1984.
   After a five-year break, Caparas was summoned to court in April.
But the judge postponed the case again after learning that the
arresting officer had disappeared, the doctor who examined the woman
had died and the victim herself had emigrated to Canada.
   Officials blame the chaos on the breakdown on corruption of the
judiciary under ousted President Ferdinand Marcos. When Mrs. Aquino
took office three years ago, she replaced numerous judges and
restored a measure of judicial independence.
   ``Like any organization, we have our share of misfits,'' said
Supreme Court Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan. ``We try our best to
weed them out as fast as we can, but there are still a few rascals
left who are giving the entire judiciary a bad name.''
   Early in her term, Mrs. Aquino established a commission of
legislative, judicial and executive branch officials to draft
reforms.
   Fernan has designated 84 courts for a ``continual trial'' project
to speed up cases. Under the project, litigants must agree to finish
presenting evidence within 90 days.
   In September, Ordonez ordered prosecutors to finish pre-trial
investigations within 60 days. If they don't meet the deadline, they
don't get paid. In May, 200 prosecutors received their salaries late
because of delays in pre-trial investigations.
   ``I stress to the judges that this is our last chance to prove to
the people that they can get justice from us, that they don't have
to take the law into their own hands,'' Fernan said.

   Nicholas Hastings, a British journalist for
AP-Dow Jones, a joint venture of The Associated Press and Dow Jones
and Co., was aboard the Marchioness when it sank in the River
Thames. Here is his account.)
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS HASTINGS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   LONDON _ It was a perfect night for a party on the river, and an
unusually warm night, which is probably what saved my life.
   I had met with some friends and boarded the Marchioness at
Charing Cross pier as guests of a friend who had chartered the boat
for his birthday party.
   I was standing outside on the bow, talking with my friends. We
had been sailing for about 20 minutes and we were laughing at
various buildings we passed, saying how awful they looked, when
suddenly there was a small jolt.
   Somebody screamed.
   The first thing that ran through my mind was that we had hit
something in the river. But as I turned around I could see the
enormous, looming hull of the dredger that had hit us. It was right
on top of us.
   As I did that, somebody else yelled, ``We're going over!'' And
that's exactly what it did, in a matter of seconds.
   I was extremely lucky, as I was standing on the left-hand side of
the bow and the boat rolled to the right, and as the boat rolled I
was able to clamber over the hull and eventually found myself
standing bone-dry on top of the overturned keel.
   I was the only person I could see. Everybody else had disappeared
under the boat, including two friends I was standing with.
   I knew that my standing outside was what probably saved my life.
A colder day may have driven me below deck. Those below deck on the
dance floor must have been dragged down with the Marchioness.
   But all of a sudden I realized that the boat was rocking back up
slightly. The first thought that came to my mind was that at least
the others on board are going to be able to get out now. But I
realized it meant that I had to jump, which I did.
   I bobbed up some yards away from the boat and discovered myself
being swept along in the very strong tidal current. I realized there
was no landing point nearby. I knew I couldn't afford to go with the
flow, and decided to strike out for what appeared to be two moored
barges and a glitter of a little patch of mud across the river.
   Luckily I'm a regular swimmer. I jettisoned my glasses, decided I
didn't have time to get rid of my shoes.
   After what seemed like a very long time I finally hit what felt
like the bottom. I stood in knee-high water for the first time, and
what had been an eerie silence became the swiftly receding screams
for help of the other passengers.
   I then started shouting because I realized I couldn't get up the
riverbank wall. Two police launches passed. I screamed. One stopped
as if it had heard me, then sped off again. A man passed in a tiny
skiff and didn't hear me.
   By that stage I was fairly frantic. I'd been in the water 10 or
15 minutes and was getting cold.
   I then saw two security guards from a building across the river
running across the bridge. They finally heard my shouts or caught
sight of me.
   They lowered a ladder and pulled me out of the water.

<HEAD>US Observers Optimistic About Reaching Agreement With Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union are the
closest they've been in 21 years of efforts to an agreement on the
first treaty banning chemical weapons, U.S. officials and
arms-control groups say.
   ``No breakthrough is imminent, but a lot of hurdles have been
cleared and it now looks like a treaty is possible if we can keep on
getting agreement,'' said a State Department official, speaking last
week on condition of anonymity.
   Little progress on a chemical weapons treaty between the two
superpowers had been reported until last month, when the Soviets
moved toward the U.S. position on verification and the destruction
of existing weapons stockpiles.
   The focus shifts to the latest round of talks, which resumed
Thursday in Geneva and are expected to last 10 days. Talks began in
1968.
   ``I think there is reason to be optimistic, although a number of
details have to be worked out and with a treaty like this, the
important stuff is in the details,'' said Lee Feinstein of the Arms
Control Association, a private group which monitors global arms
control efforts.
   John Isaacs, speaking for the Council for a Livable World, agreed.
   ``I believe chances are pretty good for a treaty in the next
year,'' said Isaacs, whose non-profit arms control group has often
been critical of the Reagan and Bush administrations. ``The Bush
administration is pushing for it and there seems to be support in
both countries.
   ``One major impetus was the extensive use by Iraq of chemical
weapons.''
   Iraq used chemical weapons in its recent war with Iran, a
conflict that ended a year ago with a cease-fire. Iraq reportedly
use mustard gas and nerve gas, both against Iran and against its own
Kurdish minority.
   The war renewed attention on gas weapons, which had not been
extensively used since World War I.
   Although only the United States and the Soviets admit to having
chemical weapons, CIA officials have told Congress they believe that
15 to 20 nations possess the weapons.
   Chemical weapons were first used in World War I by Germany. They
were widely used by both sides and caused more than 1.3 million
casualties. A 1925 treaty bans the first use of chemical weapons,
although not their possession.
   The U.S.-Soviet talks are taking place amid the 40-nation
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. There is no guarantee that
other countries will accept any deal worked out by the two
superpowers, said Feinstein.
   But Gordon Burk of the Federation of American Scientists, another
non-profit group which has been critical of the past two
administrations, said he thinks a U.S.-Soviet treaty can be sold to
other nations.
   ``If the Soviets and the United States agree that they want
something and show a strong will, they can twist some arms,'' he
said.
   In recent months, the Soviets have generally been more upbeat
than the United States about prospects for a treaty. After the last
round of talks, Soviet officials said a treaty could be reached by
the end of this year, while U.S. officials said only that the talks
had been productive.
   A major problem in verifying compliance is that many of the
chemical components used in weapons can be produced in a variety of
plants, such as facilities built for fertilizers or pharmaceuticals.
   One verification plan proposed by the United States and accepted
by the Soviets involves surprise inspections of sites either side
suspected of being used to make gas weapons.
   The Soviets had previously opposed such inspections, but abruptly
changed their stance. Now, the two sides have to work out details,
such as whether observers from the challenging nation would be
allowed to witness the inspection, according to U.S. officials
involved in the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Another unresolved question involves destruction of existing
stockpiles and production facilities, the officials said.
   Another hurdle is an exchange of data by both sides about the
size of location of each country's stockpile, according to the
officials. Although the size of the U.S. stockpile is classified, it
is believed to be about 25,000 tons.
   The Soviets claim to have 50,000 tons, although U.S. officials
say the Soviets may have up to 300,000 tons.
   Any treaty would have to be ratified by the Senate, but the pact
has wide support in the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Last month, the House voted 414-4 approval of a resolution
calling for a global ban. Recently, 75 of 100 senators signed a
letter urging President Bush to push for a treaty.

<HEAD>Rare Tremor Rattles Nerves In Northwest Alabama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A rare earthquake rattled northwestern
Alabama and parts of Tennessee, toppling books from shelves,
slightly damaging at least two homes and startling residents unused
to tremors.
   The mild quake, which registered 3.9 on the Richter scale, struck
at 7:03 p.m. Saturday and was centered 15 miles south of this town
of 37,000, according to the National Earthquake Information Center
in Golden, Colo.
   Police switchboards lit up with calls after the shaker, but there
were no reports of injuries, according to officials in several
jurisdictions.
   ``The ground trembled,'' said L.E. Woody of Florence, who was
sitting on his patio when he realized the rumbling was something
more than a thunderstorm. ``It felt like the concrete and all moved
under my feet.''
   Reports of shaking came from Colbert and Lauderdale counties in
Alabama's northwest corner and from around Lawrenceburg, Tenn., near
the Alabama line.
   Two homeowners in Colbert County reported damage _ cracked bricks
on one home and a crack in the basement of the other _ said Eddy
Hicks, the state emergency management coordinator for the area.
   In Lauderdale County, books fell from shelves, said George
Mangum, the Alabama emergency management agency's local director.
   The temblor was felt in Iron City, Tenn., just north of the
Alabama line, said Joanna Kennemer, communications operator at the
Tennessee Highway Patrol office in Lawrenceburg.
   Police departments in northwest Alabama were inundated with
telephone calls.
   ``People said it shook their house and their windows real bad,''
said Muscle Shoals police Officer Donald Coon, 34, experiencing his
first earthquake. ``It sounded like a big explosion and then the
ground shook for two or three seconds. You could feel it coming.''
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, and a 4-magnitude quake can do moderate local
damage.

<HEAD>The Last Flyby: Voyager 2 Closes In On Distant Neptune</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A robot explorer named Voyager 2 flies
past Neptune this week for its dazzling last picture show _ the
final photo opportunity during the spacecraft's four-planet, 4.4
billion-mile odyssey.
   ``We're getting close, everything is working extremely well and
we're all excited,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The surf is definitely up here at JPL,'' joked Franklin
O'Donnell, a spokesman for the lab where about 170 scientists from
around the world are asembling for the critical period.
   Coincidentally, Sunday was the 12th anniversary of Voyager 2's
launch from Florida on Aug. 20, 1977.
   The researchers will share ultimate exhilaration as front-row
observers for humanity's first close-up look at the solar system's
fourth-largest planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times Earth's
diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
Neptune encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a U.S.
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: Magellan
at Venus, Galileo at Jupiter and the Mars Observer.
   And with no one planning a mission to Pluto, Neptune is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from Earth in
the foreseeable future.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like Marco Polo,
Magellan and Columbus,'' said Jurrie van der Woude, a JPL spokesman.
``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Only a few days and a few million miles remain until 8:59 p.m.
PDT Thursday, when Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloudtops _ much closer than
its encounters with Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in
1986.
   As of 9 a.m. PDT Monday, Voyager 2 will be 2.743 billion miles
from Earth and 3.211 million miles from Neptune, approaching the
planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in 1977, Voyager 2 has
traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With a final course correction Monday morning, NASA engineers
will put Voyager 2 on its precise trajectory for the Neptune flyby.
   Sending Voyager to Neptune was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,'' says
``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide'' by mission planning manager
Charles Kohlhase and his staff.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments will pour in so quickly
that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct
daily news conferences starting Monday and continuing through Aug.
29.
   By late last week, Voyager had already revealed some of Neptune's
secrets, including:
   _Four previously unknown moons, in addition to Nereid and
backward-orbiting Triton, which were discovered from Earth. Voyager
is likely to discover more moons.
   _Clouds and other weather features, including 2,700-mile-wide
bands similar to jet streams on Earth, and a 8,100-by-4,100-mile
dark spot, probably a huge storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
   _Two partial rings of debris, called ring arcs, that are much
different from the complete rings that encircle Saturn and Uranus.
Scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting Neptune.
   _A magnetic field surrounding Neptune, suggesting the planet also
may have auroras like Earth's northern lights and may be enveloped
by orbiting radiation belts similar to Earth's Van Allen belts.
   The Neptune encounter is the climax of the $865 million,
twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw Voyager 1 explore
Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   Haynes said Monday's course correction will assure Voyager 2 can
aim a radio signal at Earth when the probe starts to pass behind
Neptune.
   Ellis Miner, deputy project scientist, said by measuring changes
in the signal, scientists hope to determine Neptune's atmospheric
pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup; whether ring arcs are
made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and how material is
distributed inside Neptune.
   The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal
strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to Earth
for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, Miner said.
When Voyager sends pictures and data to Earth, they take four hours
and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second.
   During its closest encounter with Neptune, Voyager will pass over
the planet's north pole, which will be cloaked in winter darkness.
Six minutes later, Voyager will start a 49-minute trip through
Neptune's shadow. Instead of photographing Neptune during those
times, the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures
of any ring arcs and of one of the newly discovered moons.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Sunday
asserted the right of federal investigators to examine the telephone
records of reporters who may have been ``leaked'' information from
government sources.
   Although he refused to say whether he had tried to obtain such
records, Thornburgh said on NBC TV's ``Meet the Press'' that such a
request would be permitted under the First Amendment to the
Constitution.
   ``Well, isn't that a violation of the First Amendment?''
columnist Bob Novak asked Thornburgh.
   ``Not according to the Supreme Court of the United States,''
Thornburgh answered. ``If we were to do that, we would be well
within constitutional bounds.''
   A message was left at the home of a Justice Department spokesman
for clarification on the Supreme Court rulings to which Thornburgh
was referring.
   Thornburgh has ordered an investigation into leaks surrounding
U.S. Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., shortly before he was elected House
Democratic whip. Gray was interviewed by FBI agents on Memorial Day,
triggering reports he was under investigation.
   The Justice Department later said Gray was not the subject of an
investigation.

<HEAD>Juror's Murder Creates Legal and Emotional Dilemma</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For months the jury heard gruesome details of
violent death from grieving survivors. Then murder struck one of the
``Night Stalker'' jurors and the nightmarish stories hit home.
   Phyllis Singletary, who had served with her fellow jurors for
more than a year, was gone _ shot to death by her live-in boyfriend
who later committed suicide.
   The murder created an unprecedented legal and emotional dilemma.
Many of the jurors wept openly when they heard the news Tuesday. And
defense lawyers worried about how closely jurors would connect the
death in their midst with the charges they were weighing against
Richard Ramirez.
   Ramirez, 29, a shaggy-haired drifter from El Paso, Texas, is
accused of being the devil worshiping ``Night Stalker,'' a serial
killer whose rampage of murder, rape and robbery terrorized Southern
California in the summer of 1985. Many of his victims were shot to
death.
   Defense attorney Ray G. Clark asked that deliberations be
suspended to let jurors absorb the shock of Ms. Singletary's death.
He feared that jurors might vent their anger on Ramirez because
``He's their only target.''
   But Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan had one overriding
priority: to bring the long trial to a conclusion. He sent in an
alternate to replace Ms. Singletary, and, after one day off, he
allowed deliberations to begin anew.
   Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin, who had struggled to
keep the 4-year-old prosecution case on track, supported Tynan's
decision.
   ``It really is our responsibility here to look to the living and
carry this thing forward,'' he said.
   It was not the first disruption of deliberations. On Friday, Aug.
11, after 12 days behind closed doors, the foreman sent the judge a
note. One of the jurors, he reported, had been sleeping during their
talks.
   Tynan interviewed panelists about the problem, then decided to
dismiss the sleepy juror and replace him with an alternate. Under
the law, this meant starting deliberations all over again.
   On Monday, only 11 jurors showed up.
   Ms. Singletary, 30, a Pacific Bell employee, failed to appear.
When she didn't answer her phone by midday, the judge sent sheriff's
deputies to her home. They found her dead, shot twice in the chest
after being beaten.
   Within a day, her boyfriend, James Melton, 51, was dead by his
own hand. After writing a suicide note in which he admitted killing
Ms. Singletary, he put a gun to his temple and shot himself.
   Beyond the immediate tragedy was the question of what to do about
the ``Night Stalker'' trial. Should a mistrial be declared?
Attorneys searched through law books, but couldn't find that
anything similar had happened before.
   ``The law is scant on this issue,'' reported Clark, and the judge
agreed. He decided to seek guidance from the jury foreman.
   On Wednesday, foreman Felipe Rodriguez told Tynan that the jurors
were calm and ready to go forward.
   ``Everyone appears to have put it behind them,'' he said.
   Tynan then called the jury before him and stressed that they
should not confuse the killing of Ms. Singletary with the murders
charged against Ramirez.
   ``Please understand that none of this had anything to do with
whether Mr. Ramirez is guilty or innocent of these charges,'' Tynan
told them.
   ``We must get on with the task that life has given us ...,'' he
said. ``No matter how deeply you feel about her death, it is in no
way connected to the case of Richard Ramirez.''
   With that, the panel recessed and began its deliberations for the
third time behind closed doors. It was to resume deliberations
Monday, following its weekend off.

<TEXT>
   Here is a text of the first speech by
Tadeusz Mazowiecki after his nomination as Poland's prime minister.
It was delivered to supporters Sunday from the steps of St.
Brygida's Church and translated by The Associated Press.
   
   ``My dears, my beloved. What am I supposed to tell you today? I
am very happy that I was able to direct my first steps here to
Gdansk after being granted permission to form the government by Mr.
President (Jaruzelski). We began here in 1980. I am really happy to
be here.
   ``I am happy about all who we have with us today _ the real
creator of this historic event, our leader, Lech Walesa. I am also
happy to have my friends from the KKW (union leadership) and the OKP
(Solidarity parliament caucus) and I am very happy that they are
with us and that we will go further along the same road.
   ``And what should I say from myself at the moment? First of all,
I can see giant tasks in front of me. I understand that Poland needs
first of all bread, not a premier. I understand it. But what should
we do to make everybody satisfied?
   ``I think that there is only one way. We sang today at the
church, `Poland lives, Poland is growing.' We must believe that this
nation, which is an excellent nation, a wonderful nation, can reach
the stage when life will be better in Poland, so that no one misses
anything in Poland, no one leaves it.
   ``Today when we open this historic chapter, we must reject a
feeling of hoplessness and helplessness. It must be rejected because
no one can do anything not believing that it can be done. Why should
we be a nation that cannot make it? It is not like that. We are a
skillful nation. We can do a lot. We can.
   ``We have to go along the road to democracy and also to a better
economy. But we also must believe that we are capable. And if I do
become the future premier, I have no other road than this _ that
despite difficulties, I believe that we can do it. Poland is alive.''

<TEXT>
   This is the full text of the statement
released Sunday by the Revolutionary Justice Organization. It was
translated into English by The Associated Press bureau in Beirut:
   
   In the name of the Almighty,
   To the spiteful rulers of France, who are chronically forgetting,
   Once again France enters the East as an enemy of the oppressed
people and unmasks its treacherous face at a time when we imagined
it has learnt from the bitter past and will not repeat the
experiment.
   But recent events have proven that France's rulers have forgotten
the lessons and still insist on following the American criminal
policies aimed at confronting the rightful aspirations of the
persecuted people in the region.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, which has pledged itself
to the defense of the rights of the oppressed, will not allow France
to intervene in the region under any pretext. It also declares the
following:
   1. We serve a clear-cut warning: the depth of the French
strategic security will be a stage of our options.
   2. Our responses will not be confined to directly related areas
because all means of pressure are available and all options are open.
   3. America, which is spurring France on, should realize that any
foolhardiness by the French fleet will expose the life of its

<HEAD>Israeli Minister To Poland, Auschwitz Convent To Be Discussed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli minister left Sunday for an official
visit to Poland and said he will raise the issue of a Roman Catholic
convent that has angered Jews because it is next to the Auschwitz
concentration camp.
   The week-long trip by Religious Affairs Minister Zevulun Hammer
is the first official visit by an Israeli minister since the two
countries restored diplomatic ties in 1986. Poland severed ties in
1967.
   Hammer said he will met President Wojciech Jaruzelski as well as
church officials and members of the Jewish community. He said
meetings with the premier-designate, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, and
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa also were possible.
   Hammer told Israel radio he will bring Jaruzelski a special
message from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, but neither he nor a
spokesman for Shamir would provide any details.
   He said he will discuss bilateral relations and the restoration
and preservation of Jewish synagogues, cemeteries and holy books.
   ``Of course, there is a subject that is creating an uproar in the
Jewish world, the Carmelite convent issue in Auschwitz, and I hope
to discuss the issue both with the authorities and the church,'' he
said.
   Jewish groups consider the presence of Christian symbols at the
Auschwitz camp a desecration of the memory of Jews killed in the
Nazi Holocaust. An estimated 2.5 million Jews were among the four
million people muredred at the camp during World War II.
   Under an accord signed by Catholic and Jewish leaders in 1987,
the nuns were supposed to have moved by Feb. 22 to a prayer center
to be built several thousand yards away.
   
   The deadline passed, and the new center has yet to be built.
   Zevulun Or-Lev, a senior religious affairs ministry official,
said Hammer would meet Krakow Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, who is
in charge of the convent, and ``will explain morally that the
Auschwitz death camp is first and foremost a Jewish site.''
   Dozens of Jewish twins who underwent cruel medical experiments at
Auschwitz at the hands of Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele are now in
Poland. Accompanied by four Israeli legislators, they plan to visit
Auschwitz to express their condemnation of the Carmelite convent.

   African leaders gathered here Sunday for
a four-day summit to chart a new strategy on South Africa and speed
up efforts to end regional conflicts.
   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, chairman of the Non-Aligned
Movement, will open Monday's daylong meeting of the 16-member
Organization of African Unity ad hoc committee on southern Africa.
   Last month, the committee was charged by the 50-member OAU summit
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with devising a new approach to South
Africa.
   The meeting comes a week before one of Africa's elder statesmen,
President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, is set to meet acting South
African President F.W. de Klerk in the Zambian resort town of
Livingstone to discuss possible political change in the white-led
nation.
   Kaunda, according to aides, will urge de Klerk to abolish the
racial policy of apartheid and not simply reform it. He also will
stress that black nations will continue to support guerrilla
violence in South Africa until apartheid ends.
   This week's summit in Harare is timed to capitalize on recent
peace accords reached between Pretoria and two neighbors, the former
Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique.
   ``The meeting is among the most important meetings dealing with
the question of apartheid, the consideration of a new strategy
against apartheid,'' Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
Boutros Ghali told reporters. ``We believe that there's a new
political atmosphere and there's a change and we must cope with the
change.'' He did not elaborate.
   Monday's summit, the first of four to be held in Harare, will
discuss proposals for a new approach to South Africa's racial
policies from the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist
Congress, the two main guerrilla-backed movements fighting white
domination.
   Pan-Africanist Congress president Zephania Mothopeng said on
arrival in Harare Saturday the talks would probably ``affect South
Africa's destiny.'' But nationalist leaders would not disclose
details of their proposals before they were unveiled before the
Organization of African Unity committee.
   Any decision taken by the leaders will be submitted to the next
summit of the 101-member Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, next month.
   The ad hoc committee is chaired by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and is comprised of Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Cape Verde,
Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia,
Zimbabwe, the African National Congress, the Pan African Congress
and the South-west Africa People's Organization. Mubarak, current
chairman of the Oorganization of African Unity, arrived in Harare
Sunday.
   On Tuesday, the eight-nation special peace committee on Angola
will review efforts towards peace in that territory following a
recent accord between the Marxist government and Jonas Savimbi's
Western-backed National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   It was not clear Sunday whether Savimbi would attend.
   On Wednesday, heads of five Portuguese-speaking African states
will hold a special summit to specifically discuss ways of securing
peace to Angola and Mozambique. The other three members are Cape
Verde, Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome-Principe.

   Members of the United Democratic
Front and seven other banned anti-apartheid groups unfurled their
banners at a cathedral Sunday and declared they would defy
government emergency laws by operating openly again.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu led a multi-racial congregation
of 2,500 in chanting, ``No to apartheid, no to injustice, no to
oppression and no to racism,'' at the church service, which replaced
a planned rally at the mixed-race University of the Western Cape.
Police prevented that rally from taking place.
   The declarations by the anti-apartheid groups, some of which took
place in Johannesburg, are part of a national defiance campaign
organized to coincide with the sixth birthday of the 700-group
United Democratic Front anti-apartheid coalition.
   They aim to challenge the government in the weeks before the
Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, which exclude the black majority.
   Organizers in Cape Town obtained a last-minute Supreme Court
order forbidding police from interfering with the rally at the
cathedral.
   But a similar rally in Johannesburg, also banned, was thwarted
when police blockaded main entrances to the white University of the
Witwatersrand. About 200 protesters slipped through and held a rally
addressed by little-known spokesmen who refused to identify
themselves but declared the United Democratic Front and five
affiliate organizations ``unbanned.''
   After the Johannesburg rally ended, about 50 black youths chanted
and danced on the campus lawn until police moved in with batons and
dispersed them. The independent South African Press Association
quoted an unidentified foreign diplomat as saying police injured
several of the youths and arrested about 20.
   Sources close to anti-apartheid leaders said many of those in
Johannesburg had gone into hiding Friday after police detained
Mohammed Valli Moosa, acting general secretary of the United
Democratic Front, under emergency regulations that allow them to
hold a suspect indefinitely without charge.
   Valli Moosa was a principal organizer of the defiance campaign,
which involves challenges to segregation at beaches, hospitals, in
parks, buses and schools.
   A mobile emergency medical clinic was on standby outside the
cathedral in case of injuries from police action, but because of the
court order the police remained two blocks away, sitting in parked
vans. However, they set up a roadblock on the main highway into Cape
Town and stopped a busload of people from attending the rally.
   Police also prevented students from leaving the campus of the
University of the Western Cape.
   Referring to a police attack Saturday on hundreds of blacks
attempting to picnic on whites-only Cape peninsula beaches, Tutu
said: ``They say apartheid is dead. It is one of the most
extraordinary corpses around.
   ``They had police, dogs and tear gas to stop people from walking
on God's beaches. I have never been more proud of people who are
involved in the struggle for justice and freedom in this country
than yesterday. It is our country and we are claiming what is
ours,'' he said.
   The banner of each organization was unfurled as the group was
pronounced ``unbanned.''
   Zoli Malindi, leader of the United Democratic Front in western
Cape province, defied restrictions which prohibit him from
addressing a gathering. He declared:
   ``The United Democratic Front is unbanned and will continue as if
it has never been banned.''
   Representatives of the organizations, holding the banners aloft,
marched outside the church and then dispersed after the 2{-hour
service.

   Solidarity has scored a spectacular coup by
gaining control of the government barely four months after its
legalization, unseating a Communist Party entrenched for 45 years.
   But the opposition movement that refused to perish under the tank
tracks of martial law may be facing its greatest challenge yet.
   It must try to solve the intractable Polish economic puzzle with
inexperienced people in its ranks and a hostile Communist Party at
its side. And to solve that economic puzzle, it must take unpopular
steps that will tend to alienate its bedrock of support, the Polish
worker.
   ``For the second time in its history, Solidarity is entering a
course that may toss its ship on the rocks,'' activist Jerzy
Jedlicki wrote in the opposition's Gazeta Wyborcza last week.
   ``It is very risky,'' said union spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz on
the night that Solidarity editor Tadeusz Mazowiecki was nominated
prime minister.
   Without a doubt the Polish opposition has gone farther than ever
before in loosening the hold on power of the Polish United Workers
Party, but it will have to step very gingerly against enormous odds
to keep the clock from turning back again.
   In a bow to geopolitical realities, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
declared in advance of Mazowiecki's nomination that the key
ministries of defense and interior will stay headed by communists.
Presumably, the Soviet Union, Poland's superpower neighbor, would
not have acquiesced to anything less.
   That means that what opposition spokesmen call the ``forces of
coercion'' _ the army and the police _ will remain entirely in the
hands of the party.
   Jedlicki, arguing against the opposition taking the government,
said that in any situation when the party senses it is in ``mortal
danger,'' it will still have the means to mobilize a counterattack:
another martial law.
   Every decision that Mazowiecki takes as prime minister will have
to be weighed against this threat.
   For instance, how fast can he move to dismantle Communist control
of the state-owned mass media? Will the Solidarity economic minister
be able to order a cut in defense spending or look into secret
police budgets? Does a decision to fire thousands of party workers
risk a reaction?
   It will be a delicate calculation, especially because Mazowiecki
will be under pressure from society to move quickly _ especially in
the realm of the economy.
   Mazowiecki got a foretaste Sunday of what he can expect.
   ``We need bread, not a premier'' militant hecklers chanted at his
first public appearance after being nominated.
   If Mazowiecki does not bring fast results in improving the
material situation in Poland, not even his affiliation with Walesa
and Solidarity will protect him from public anger.
   Solidarity, always more moderate at the top than some of its
members, itself will face sharp competition from the
Communist-linked official union known as OPZZ, which will press
economic demands at every opportunity in a bid to win a following.
   Solidarity can anticipate being torn between workers, who demand
that the union protect their jobs and living standards, and
Mazowiecki's need as prime minister to moderate wage growth and
close wasteful, unprofitable state enterprises to improve the
economy.
   The government will be ``the focus of all expectations of the
rallying society, and it will have to disappoint it, because there
is no wonder drug to cure Poland's economy,'' Jedlicki wrote.
   The Polish economy is in a tailspin. Inflation is over 100
percent and climbing, the government budget deficit this year
approaches $1 billion and the $39 billion foreign debt is among the
highest in the world. Agricultural and industrial production are
falling, mainly the result of crumbling infrastructures and the
flight of much of the workforce abroad.
   On the man-in-the-street level, shops are empty, telephones and
public transportation increasingly do not work and hours of
productive time daily are wasted in obtaining or organizing the
necessities of life _ whether medicine for a sick child or gasoline
for commuting to work.
   In this atmosphere of descending cataclysm, the Communist Party
for years had been trying to persuade the opposition to accept
``co-responsibility'' for Poland's fate.
   By handing Solidarity the prime minister's job, it may have
succeeded.
   Onyszkiewicz would have preferred to wait before the opposition
entered government. But he admits Solidarity finally had no choice.
With the Communist Party so discredited, the country was suffering a
leadership vacuum, he said.
   But the union will be handicapped by a lack of people who have
practical experience in government, he said.
   In fact the government will continue to include tens of thousands
of loyal party members who will have little incentive to see that
Solidarity succeeds.
   Nevertheless, Solidarity has a few trumps it can play.
   First, there's its ability to marshal public enthusiasm as
demonstrated in the incredible whirlwind election campaign that saw
it winning all but one of the 261 pariliament seats it was allowed
to contest.
   Second, is its close ties to the West. Financial assistance
promised during the visit to Poland in July of President Bush was
only 1 percent of what Solidarity requested.
   But perhaps the West will be somewhat more generous to ensure the
survival of the first non-Communist regime in the East bloc.

   Fort Worth Zoo officials still aren't
sure what sex their new baby rhino is, but they know its
significance.
   The 100-pound black rhinoceros calf is the first born under a
program designed to save the species from extinction through captive
breeding, and biologists hope it will be the first of many born on
U.S. zoos and ranches.
   The baby is about the size of a large dog, and has a bump on its
nose that will later grow into a large horn. It was closely tended
by its mother, Ngwete, one of 10 black rhinos brought to the United
States last month from Zimbabwe.
   Ngwete gave birth Friday evening, and the event was immediately
hailed as a milestone in the effort to try to preserve the species.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said Harry Tennison, who organized the
shipment of black rhinos to breeding programs in the United States.
   ``I already have a name for it,'' Tennison said. ``I'd like to
call it `Lucky' because of how lucky we are to have it.''
   Fort Worth Zoo director Elvie Turner Jr. said the baby is
healthy, but that experts won't be able to determine its sex for
some time.
   Turner said he was considering naming the rhino Harry, after
Tennison, if it turns out to be male.
   ``Maybe we'll call it Lucky Harry,'' he said.

   Iran's parliament on Sunday rejected a
motion to fire an industry minister for failing to prevent fraud at
a state automobile plant, official Iranian reports said.
   The parliament also questioned Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, a leading hard-liner dropped from a newly proposed
Cabinet, the reports said. They gave no details on what he was
asked, however.
   The new President Hashemi Rafsanjani dropped Mohtashemi from his
proposed list of Cabinet members in an effort to keep anti-Western
radicals out of government and install a team of more pragmatic
technocrats.
   Heavy Industries Mininister Behzad Nabavi was also dropped from
that list. However, his early ouster by Parliament would have been
the first time the body fired a minister.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said 123 deputies voted in favor of dropping the no-confidence
motion against Nabavi, with 73 voting for it and 21 abstentions.
   Opponents of the motion criticized a parliamentary inquiry that
concluded Nabavi had effectively aided the scandal at the automobile
plant by not acting swiftly against it, the agency said.
   The call for his dismissal came in a 60-page report resulting
from the inquiry. The report was signed by four parliamentary
deputies, the agency said.
   Nabavi, 47, has served in the Cabinet since 1980.
   The eight-hour debate in the parliament, or Majlis, replaced a
planned discussion of Rafsanjani's proposed 22-member Cabinet. Each
proposed member must be approved by a majority of deputies.
   The official news agency quoted a deputy from the northern
Azerbaijan province, Habib Borumand, as sayig Mohtashemi had
violated Majlis regulations by failing to show up within 20 days to
answer the queries.
   However, the majority of parlementarians have supported
Mohtashemi in the past. On Friday, more than 138 deputies submitted
a petition asking the new president, considered the leader of the
rival pragmatist faction, to reinstate the hard-liner.
   According to the news agency, the attacks on Nabavi stem from the
conviction of nine people for embezzling $360 million. They were
found guilty of illegally selling cars made at the Saipa plant on
the black market and overcharging for cars ordered by government
organizations.
   The factory's former director, Touraj Mansour, was fined about
$170 million and sentenced to 70 lashes as well as a suspended
eight-year jail term.
   The plant, which manufactures cars under license from the French
Renault company, is operated by the heavy industries ministry.
   However, Nabavi told the Majlis on Sunday that he was really
under attack for other reasons, such as his support for government
rationing of basic goods, the news agency said.
   ``This is not the way to treat a minister just a week before he
completes nine years of serving in the Cabinet,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   The agency said the no-confidence motion was defeated after
questions were raised about the parliamentary inquiry's
objectiveness, lack of evidence linking Nabavi with the fraud, and
his reputation as one of the government's most competent ministers.

   An Afghan general who was in charge of
President Najib's personal security force has defected to the rebel
side, and he said Sunday that his country's Marxist regime could
soon fall.
   Maj. Gen. Mohammad Farouk Zarif, 39, is the brother of
Afghanistan's former U.N. ambassador, Farid Zarif, one of Najib's
closest advisers.
   The general, the highest-ranking military defector the
Pakistan-based insurgents have ever paraded in public, said that
Najib's government was weak.
   ``If the Russians cut off all supplies to Najib, he'd be finished
in two or three months,'' Zarif told a news conference.
   U.S. and Western diplomats in Peshawar, near Pakistan's border
with Afghanistan, confirmed the man at the news conference was Zarif
and his position as former chief of security for Najib and other top
officials.
   The U.S. special envoy to the Afghan rebels, Peter Thomsen,
hinted in July of a major military defection from Afghanistan.
   Zarif said he fled the war-torn country in June after serving 18
months as chief of the 3,000-strong government security force which
protects Najib and the Afghan Politburo. He gave no details of how
he left.
   Speaking Persian through an interpreter, Zarif said his wife and
two children were with him in Pakistan, but they were considering
seeking political asylum in the United States.
   Zarif said he felt disillusioned by the ruling People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan, which seized power in a 1978
military coup.
   ``At the time I thought the party would serve through a
parliamentary campaign, would enact land reforms, literacy programs,
social services and provide social justice to a variety of ethnic
groups,'' Zarif said. ``But unfortunately, its real actions brought
about exactly the opposite.''
   He indicated he had information that could breach Najib's
security but refused to say whether he had given it to the
U.S.-backed rebels, called mujahedeen or Islamic ``holy warriors.''
   Zarif said the president's personal security staff included two
Soviet advisers who dealt mainly with technical and communications
problems.
   He claimed military morale in Afghanistan was low despite the
guerrillas' failure to capture a major city since the Feb. 15
completion of the withdrawal of some 103,000 Soviet combat troops.
   Zarif said the guerrilla's stalled offensive on the eastern city
of Jalalabad, which began March 6, was not typical of Afghan
defenses.
   ``Najib concentrated all military attention toward Jalalabad.
There was a continual resupply,'' he said, adding that military
units were deployed from elsewhere in the country to defend the city.
   Zarif said he doubted the guerrillas would meet the same response
if they were to attack other government-held cities including Kabul,
the capital.
   His appearance marked the opening of the Media Information
Department of Islamic Afghanistan, a public relations unit of the
mujahedeen's own self-proclaimed government in exile.
   The U.S.-backed rebels, the most powerful of which are based in
the Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar, are fighting to topple the
Soviet-backed Kabul regime and establish an Islamic republic of
Afghanistan.
   Communist forces hold the capital and most of Afghanistan's key
cities but mujahedeen control most of the countryside.
   The guerrillas recently have stepped up rocket attacks on Kabul,
reportedly with new, multi-head missiles supplied by the United
States.
   Soviet forces entered Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the Marxist
government and fight the rebellion. Moscow agreed to withdraw last
year under a U.N. accord and completed the troop pullout in February.
   Western diplomats predicted that the rebels, who control much of
the countryside, would overrun major cities in a matter of months,
but government forces supplied with Soviet arms have managed to
rebuff rebel attacks.

   Another barrier fell to glasnost Sunday as the
Soviets revealed to their own people and the rest of the world the
deadliest weapon in their air force arsenal _ the needle-nosed
strategic bomber NATO calls the Blackjack.
   Plagued by a chain of recent mishaps, including plane crashes and
the highly publicized defection of a fighter pilot, the Soviet air
force may have needed some good publicity.
   In a dazzling three-hour air show _ the country's first in more
than 20 years _ it aimed to show Soviet and foreign doubters that it
still very much has the right stuff.
   Although Western air attaches who attended said they saw little
that was new, the ``Aviation-Sports Holiday'' was clearly in line
with the policy of glasnost, or openness, pursued by the Kremlin
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which has also brought an
easing of the once-obsessive secrecy about military affairs.
   Assembled on the grass at Tushino airfield in Moscow's northwest,
more than 150,000 people saw the supersonic Blackjack bomber _ known
here as the Tupolev -160 _ streak by, along with other aeronautics
novelties like the pontoon-winged A-40 floating amphibious rescue
plane, the Ilyushin 96-300 jetliner and the Tupolev-204, called the
Soviet version of the Boeing 757 by Westerners.
   The Blackjack, which the Pentagon says is the largest and
heaviest bomber in the world, flashed out of the north over Tushino
at a height of only 800-1,000 feet, its four thundering jet engines
leaving a yellow smudge of exhaust behind in the sky.
   Flying at about 380 mph, the plane, whose nose resembles that of
the Concorde supersonic jetliner, shot past the airfield in seconds,
then peeled off towards the south and the high-rise towers of a
Moscow residential district.
   Despite its NATO designation, the plane was painted a dazzling
white.
   According to the Pentagon's 1988 study ``Soviet Military Power,''
the bomber has a maximum speed of Mach 2, twice the speed of sound
or more than 1,300 mph, and an unrefueled combat range of about
4,500 miles. It reportedly can carry payloads of bombs or
air-launched cruise missiles.
   Then-U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci was invited to inspect
a Blackjack bomber at Kubinka air base near Moscow in August 1988
and saw it fly, but Sunday's flight was the first before the general
public.
   The official Tass news agency called the Blackjack's flight ``the
main event'' of the air show, which it said was attended by
Politburo members Nikolai N. Slyunkov and Viktor M. Chebrikov and
the Soviet defense minister, Dmitri T. Yazov.
   According to Jane's ``All the World's Aircraft 1988-9,'' the
Soviets are expected to build at least 100 Blackjacks at a new
complex in Kazan. Eleven had been completed by 1988, Jane's said.
   The logic of developing and deploying the bomber came under fire
in the weekly magazine Ogonyok, which again proved that taboos about
criticizing the Soviet defense establishment are much less
restrictive under Gorbachev.
   Ogonyok said the Tu-160 project began long ago as a
``forced-though expensive measure'' to reciprocate for the U.S.
decision to build the B-1B bomber.
   Each Blackjack costs the Soviet people ``millions'' of rubles,
the magazine said.
   The Tushino air show, the Soviets' first since 1967, was
officially held to celebrate Aviation Day, marked every Aug. 20. The
show's cost was pegged by Soviet officials at 800,000 rubles ($1.2
million).
   Western air attaches suggested that one purpose of the show may
have been to give the Soviet people a more favorable image of their
air force. They said that may have been necessary to counter recent
mishaps and problems.
   In July, a pilotless MiG-23 flew halfway across Europe and
crashed in Belgium, killing an 18-year-old man, after its Soviet air
force pilot ejected over Poland.
   The previous month, a Mig-29 fighter crashed at the prestigious
Paris Air Show. A joint Soviet-French commission established that a
bird had been sucked into the engine, causing the crash. Earlier
this year, a Soviet pilot defected to Turkey in a Mig-29.

   West German authorities said Sunday
that at least 90 bullets were fired across the border into East
Germany in a mysterious incident that has aggravated relations
between the two nations.
   Authorities said they had no clues of the identity or number of
assailants in the incident that occurred early Friday, nor did they
know what motivated the attack.
   Shots from the West German side of the Werra River were fired for
more than an hour in the early morning, hitting two houses and a
barn in the East German border town of Wahlhausen, according to the
East German ADN news agency.
   A police spokesman in this West German border town about 130
miles east of Bonn said Sunday that 90 small-caliber bullet casings
were found at the nearby Werra River. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   No one was injured in the incident, but it has added another
strain in relations with Communist East Germany.
   East Germany filed an official protest in Bonn on Friday, calling
the incident ``an extraordinarily provocative attack.'' The protest
said the incident ``seriously endangered the life and health of the
region's residents, as well as members of the East German border
guards.''
   Eschwege police said they might have caught the attackers if East
German authorities had informed them of the incident sooner.
   ``We don't understand why the East German border guards didn't
activate an alarm,'' one policeman said Sunday. ``Then we could have
intercepted the assailants.''
   ADN said East German leader Erich Honecker dispatched the
regional Communist Party chief to Wahlhausen to console the two
families whose homes were damaged.
   One of the residents, Egbert Jost, suggested to the news agency
that West German border guards were negligent in not preventing the
attack or the escape of the attackers.
   The agency quoted Jost calling the incident ``the worst
provocation on the West German border'' since the end of World War
II.
   Reinhold Feige, a 75-year-old retiree whose granddaughter was in
the home when it was fired on, called the attack ``indescribably
cruel.''

<HEAD>German Company Reported to Illegally Export U.S. Nuclear Technology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors are investigating a
West German company suspected of purchasing sensitive U.S. nuclear
technology and shipping it to Pakistan and India, a U.S. magazine
said in a report available Sunday.
   The NTG Neue Technologien firm of Gelnhausen has been under
investigation for suspected illegal exports since last year, and
investigators plan to ask for help from the U.S. Justice Department,
according to Nuclear Fuel, a biweekly magazine published by
McGraw-Hill Inc.
   The article prepared by the magazine's Bonn office was to appear
in Monday's edition, but it was released in advance to news agencies
in Bonn on Sunday.
   The investigative arm of the U.S. Congress, the General
Accounting Office, earlier this month released a report saying
foreign countries are gaining access to U.S. government technology
that could help them develop atomic weapons. It blamed the problem
on conflicting laws and erratic enforcement.
   The report singled out Pakistan, which is suspected of working
secretly to develop nuclear weapons, and India, which detonated a
nuclear device in 1974.
   The magazine, quoting unidentified sources involved in the
investigation, said NTG ``systematically sought, and in some cases
obtained, technology from U.S. companies for nuclear-related
programs in Pakistan and India over the past few years.'' It said
the exports were illegal.
   It said NTG officials had refused to respond to its report.
   The Associated Press called NTG's office in Gelnhausen, about 20
miles east of Frankfurt, but a recorded message said it was closed
until Monday.
   There was also no answer Sunday at the federal prosecutor's
office in Hanau, where the inquiry is being directed.
   West German companies have repeatedly been accused over the past
few years of engaging in sensitive or illegal trade.
   The Imhausen-Chemie firm of Lahr has been under investigation
this year on suspicion of outfitting a Libyan plant that Washington
says can be used for making poison gas. The case strained U.S.-West
German relations earlier this year.
   In January, the Bonn government accused five other West German
companies of helping Iraq develop chemical weapons.
   In its report, Nuclear Fuel said NTG, which has a representative
in Princeton, N.J., bought two high-powered lasers in the United
States and obtained export permission by saying they were for use in
West Germany.
   The lasers were intended for use in the production of nuclear
fuel, the magazine said.
   The U.S. firm that sold NTG the lasers, Coherent General of
Sturbridge, Mass., obtained an export permit for the sale on
condition that NTG would use them itself and that the lasers would
remain in West Germany, the magazine said.
   Shipment of such technology to the subcontinent would be outlawed
under U.S. Commerce Department regulations, the magazine said. It
would also violate the international Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
   The magazine said Peter Finke, director of the PTB consulting
firm affiliated with NTG, told investigators he was repeatedly
pressured by Pakistani agents ``to acquire an entire range of
nuclear technology, including technology to produce a thermonuclear
weapon.''
   Nuclear Fuel said the laser systems were shipped by NTG to
Frankfurt in December 1986 and re-exported to Margalla Enterprises
in Karachi, Pakistan, two weeks later. Margalla is a purchasing
agent for the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Nuclear Fuel said.
   The West German government office responsible for exports told
Nuclear Fuel that NTG apparently shipped the lasers to Pakistan
without seeking a West German export permit.
   Nuclear Fuel said it had examined financial records in West
Germany that showed the Pakistani purchaser paid NTG $425,000,
nearly three times the U.S. sale price of the laser systems.
   The magazine said NTG was also under investigation on suspicion
of shipping U.S. components for a reactor refueling machine to
Bombay, India, in 1987.
   Those parts were obtained by NTG from the Imperial Clevite Corp.,
of Cleveland, Nuclear Fuel said. The magazine said Clevite officials
believed the parts were being procured for a Canadian firm.

   Japan launched a rocket Sunday morning at the
Tanegashima Space Center off the coast of Kyushu in southwestern
Japan as part of a series of tests for developing a
satellite-launching rocket, officials said.
   The one-stage, 47-foot-tall TR-1 No. 3 test rocket lifted off at
8 a.m. (7 p.m. EDT Saturday) from Tanegashima island, officials of
the National Space Development Agency of Japan.
   Kyodo News Service reported the launch was mainly aimed at
checking air resistance and vibration as the rocket flies in the
atmosphere.
   It said the TR-1 project, begun last year, will develop the new
H-2 rocket by using data gathered by a series of test launches.
   The H-2 is designed to increase the number of satellite launches
at a lower cost, the space agency said.
   Earlier this month, the agency's three-stage H-1 rocket carrying
a weather satellite failed to lift off.
   Japan has launched 20 rockets since 1975.

   An earthquake rocked the coast of the
Peloponnesian peninsula Sunday evening, but there were no immediate
reports of damage or injuries, the Athens Seismological Institute
said.
   The quake, measuring 5.9 on the Richter Scale, struck at 8:22
p.m. (2:22 p.m. EDT) and was centered 28 miles west of the
Peleponnesus in the Ionian Sea, the institute said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. A quake of measuring 5 on the Richter scale can cause
considerable damage; a quake measuring a 6 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Death Toll At Three in Manhattan Steam Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators seeking the cause of a steam
explosion that killed three people began Sunday to reassemble the
pipe that erupted under a Manhattan street in a 15-story geyser of
400-degree gas and mud.
   A woman who was walking her dog was killed in the blast Saturday
night in the upper-class neighborhood, as was a Consolidated Edison
Co. worker on the scene. A second Con Ed worker burned in the
explosion at 20th Street and Third Avenue died overnight,
authorities said.
   At least 18 others were injured and hundreds of people were
evacuated from apartments after the 6:30 p.m. explosion.
   ``I actually saw the street rise,'' said Tom Ritchford, 27, who
was with Denise Ozker, 29, in a sidewalk cafe when the street
erupted a few feet away. ``When it came up, I covered my face and
stepped under the table and pulled Denise under the table with me.''
   ``I thought, `This is it _ we're going to die,''' said Ritchford,
who then fled with Ozker when the water raining on them became
warmer and warmer.
   A Con Ed spokesman, Marty Gitten, said four workers were
reopening a valve on the 24-inch main when it exploded just three
feet away. The steam is produced as a byproduct of power generation
and sold to buildings as a source of heat. In some older buildings,
it is even used to power elevators.
   Con Ed had turned off the steam main on Saturday morning as the
city repaired a water main leak on the same block.
   ``It will take some time to figure out the cause of the
explosion,'' Gitten said. ``We have to literally put the pieces of
damaged pipe back together and re-create the scene.''
   One possible cause, Gitten said, was stress caused by cold water
hitting the outside of the hot pipe. Pressure in the main was 150
pounds per square inch, and the steam was 400 degrees Fahrenheit,
Gitten said.
   The pedestrian, Helen Sauer, and Joseph Malfatti, a Con Ed
worker, were pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital on Saturday, said
hospital spokesman Robert Frazier.
   Con Ed worker Steven Walsh died Sunday morning in the burn center
of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, said Mary Cialone, a
hospital administrator. Two other workers remained hospitalized
there, one in critical condition, she said.

   Most Woodstock-anniversary revelers left the
site of the 1969 concert Sunday, ending a week-long celebration and
leaving behind the mud and memories of yesteryear, as well as mounds
of empty beer cans.
   Despite the lack of big-name entertainers, the unsanctioned
gathering swelled to 20,000 as people came to mark the 20th
anniversary of the rock 'n' roll concert that has become a symbol of
the '60s youth movement.
   Like its predecessor, the celebration of the Woodstock Music and
Art Festival was mostly peaceful, but it was marred by a fight late
Saturday night in which a man was stabbed.
   Joseph Basto, 39, of Newburgh, N.Y., was stabbed in the abdomen
by an unidentified man at about 11 p.m. Saturday, according to
Sullivan County Sheriff Joseph Wasser. Basto was reported in
critical condition Sunday at Harris Community General Hospital.
   Wasser said no arrest has been made and police were still
interviewing witnesses to the incident Sunday.
   ``When you have 15,000 people, you can have anything,'' Wasser
said of the stabbing. ``When you go into a bar with 20 people you
can have an assault.''
   The gathering began early last week with a handful of people and
mushroomed to about 20,000 people Friday night.
   Revelers were packing up their tents and makeshift camps, and
Wasser said only about 3,500 remained Sunday in the sloping alfalfa
field in the Catskill Mountains 110 miles northwest of New York
City. Despite its name, the festival actually took place in Bethel,
about 50 miles southeast of Woodstock.
   As it was 20 years ago, the late Max Yasgur's farm was turned
into a muddy mess by celebrants and by a cold, hard rain that began
Saturday evening and lasted into Sunday morning.
   About 400,000 young people converged on the farm Aug. 15-17,
1969, to listen to music by some of rock 'n' roll's biggest stars.
   Local musicians supplied most of the entertainment this time,
although Melanie, who performed here 20 years ago, showed up early
Friday morning and sang two songs on a makeshift stage.
   The lack of big-name stars didn't discourage many celebrants.
Though the town of Bethel staunchly refused to sanction any
organized event commemorating the concert, traffic was backed up
along several of the roads as people poured in to set up camp and
party.
   Though there were about a dozen drug-related arrests over the
weekend, alcohol _ mainly beer _ seemed to be the drug of choice
among the crowd, which ranged in age from 6 to 60. Some brought
kegs, others hauled in truckloads of cases.
   ``A lot of people here are heavy beer drinkers,'' said Joe Rogers
of Queens. ``Drugs are rare.''
   Crime was rare, though someone did make off with Rogers' spare
clothes, leaving him standing in a cold rain wearing shorts, a
long-sleeved shirt and running shoes. He said he had $4 left to get
him home.
   ``It's kind of disappointing. It kind of misses the point of all
this,'' Rogers said. But, he added, ``I have never had so much fun
in my life.''

   Two women accused of hijacking a helicopter and
using it to pluck their husbands from a Colorado prison yard say
love made them do it.
   ``What can I say? I was blinded by love,'' Rebecca Brown said
with a shrug as she was being led in handcuffs Friday night to a
sheriff's car in Holdrege, Neb., where the foursome was captured
after a nine-minute gun battle 400 miles from the prison.
   ``I love him enough to die for him,'' said Patricia Gonzales in
an interview with the Rocky Mountain News from the Phelps County
Jail in Holdrege.
   Friday morning, the women forced a helicopter pilot at gunpoint
to fly to the yard of the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility in
Ordway and lift their husbands _ cellmates Ralph Brown, 30, and
Freddie Gonzales, 21 _ to freedom, authorities say.
   One tower guard at the prison has been suspended and a second
also faces a hearing for not heeding the warden's repeated radio
calls to open fire on the helicopter.
   Guard Russ Ellis of Pueblo, who warden Jim Brittain said ``froze
up (at) that ultimate moment of truth,'' and another unnamed guard
in the prison's other watchtower will face a hearing this week. The
second guard was not suspended.
   Colorado corrections officials said the tower guards could be
fired or exonerated depending on what the probe shows.
   Nebraska officials say the four suspects likely will be charged
with attempted murder, aiding an attempted murder, felony possession
of firearms, resisting arrest and use of a firearm in the commission
of a felony.
   U.S. Attorney Mike Norton in Denver said he planned to file
federal charges, probably including air piracy, on Monday. Colorado
officials have plans for escape charges.
   Mrs. Gonzales, 41, maintains the escape attempt was the Browns'
idea. She said she got cold feet but was told by the Browns she
already was in too deep.
   ``I did what I did because I felt I was really pressured. I was
scared what might happen to us,'' she said. ``My husband just wanted
to be with me. He only had 18 months left (in prison), but he wanted
to be with me. I am scared. What's scaring me most is the separation
from him.''
   Mrs. Gonzales, a grandmother with hearts tattooed on her chest,
used to work with prison inmates as a volunteer. She met Freddie
Gonzales, 20 years her junior, at a prison in Canon City and married
him by proxy earlier this year. She was dismissed from her volunteer
work for misusing her prison clearance.
   ``She was assigning herself duties and times to be in the prison
that were not only not approved, but were inappropriate,'' George
Sullivan, deputy director of the Colorado Department of Corrections,
said Sunday.
   He said she had been assigned to work with a case manager at the
prison during the case manager's hours, but began showing up on
weekends and during evening hours, claiming she was tutoring inmates
in a class.
   Mrs. Gonzales said she met Mrs. Brown and they became friends
during visiting days.
   Letters found where Mrs. Gonzales was living near the prison
showed she ``was really pining away'' for her husband, said Crowley
County Sheriff Dale Anderson. ``She loved him so much. She was
really worried and scared.''
   He called Mrs. Brown, ``a very intelligent person,'' and said she
apparently approached Mrs. Gonzales with the escape idea three weeks
ago.
   A mother of two small children, Mrs. Brown, 26, married her
husband a little more than a year ago. Mrs. Gonzales' son, Jaime
Hernandez, 19, called Mrs. Brown ``a wild girl'' who ``always likes
to have fun, partying all the time.''
   The women rented the helicopter Friday on the pretext of looking
at real estate, authorities said. Mrs. Gonzales said she was told to
put a gun to the pilot's head and order him to drop down into the
prison.
   ``My intentions were never to kill the pilot,'' she said. ``I was
very scared. I didn't even know how to hold the gun. When everybody
got in the helicopter, they took the gun away from me. I was shaking
too much.''
   The pilot was tied up and left with the helicopter by an
abandoned farmhouse, and the escapees took off in a van. Police
later discovered three 9mm semiautomatic pistols, a .38-caliber
revolver and a .22-caliber revolver in the van.
   Mrs. Gonzales said the 400-mile trip that led the fugitives to
the shootout in Holdrege was a frightful experience in which the two
couples barely spoke.
   ``How we got caught was that I needed to use the bathroom real
bad. They wouldn't let us stop, but finally my husband made them
stop. That's when we were seen,'' she said.
   A dispatcher matched the license plate number on the van to the
number sent out on an all-points bulletin.

   NASA scientists said Sunday they plan to
launch ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft'' from a space shuttle Oct.
12, catapulting the ship Galileo to Jupiter so it can parachute a
probe into the giant planet's atmosphere.
   During its looping voyage toward a December 1995 rendezvous with
Jupiter, the spacecraft will fly by Venus, pass Earth twice, see
parts of the moon not seen since the early 1960s and make the first
close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said.
   The swings past Venus and Earth will catapult the spacecraft to
higher speeds so that it can reach Jupiter with the least
expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.
   When it passes Earth, Galileo will observe gases that cause
``greenhouse effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere, study depletion
of Earth's protective ozone layer, and make detailed observations of
parts of the moon for which only relatively primitive maps from the
early 1960s are available, said Torrence Johnson, the project
scientist.
   ``The Galileo spacecraft is a marvel,'' Neal Ausman Jr., the
mission director, said during a news conference at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboraory. ``It is the most complex spacecraft we've ever
flown at JPL _ probably the most complex spacecraft ever.''
   Clayne Yeates, acting science and mission design manager, called
Galileo the ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft,'' with an array of
scientific instruments that will allow far more detailed images and
scientific data on Jupiter and its moons than could be obtained by
the twin Voyager spacecraft.
   Among the innovations is a new imaging device that will allow
researchers to take a picture every two-and-one-third seconds. The
television cameras on Voyager 2 can take a picture only once every
50 or 60 seconds, said Yeates.
   Voyager 2 is flying past the planet Neptune this week, the climax
of its 12-year, 4.4-billion trek past four planets. It explored
Jupiter in 1979.
   Galileo will drop a probe by parachute into the Jovian atmosphere
to make detailed observations. Jupiter's atmosphere is covered with
ammonia clouds and may contain ice clouds and water droplets
underneath.
   Researchers expect to get data on lightning bolts 10,000 to
100,000 times as strong as those seen on Earth. Galileo will pass
600 miles from the Jovian moon Io, which has the most active
volcanoes in the solar system.
   The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to carry Galileo into Earth
orbit Oct. 12, then launch the spacecraft. Galileo will be boosted
into a trajectory that will take it looping around Venus, where it
will study the planet's atmosphere and make an attempt to confirm
the existence of lightning there.
   Galileo then will swing back past Earth in December 1990, using
Earth's gravity as a slingshot to pick up speed.
   Its next stop will be the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars,
where in October 1991 it will pass 600 miles from the asteroid
Gaspra, a typical asteroid about 10 miles long.
   ``We don't have any pictures of asteroids,'' said Johnson.
``Nobody's been by one.''
   The spacecraft then will swing past Earth again before being sent
on its way to Jupiter. It may have a second opportunity to pass by
an asteroid in August 1993.
   Galileo will make about 10 orbits around Jupiter, passing closest
to Io but also near Europa and Ganymede, two other Jovian moons.
   The Galileo mission has been repeatedly delayed since work began
in 1977, at which time launch was set for 1982. Budget cuts during
the Reagan administration, design changes and the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle all contributed to the delay, said John
Casani, former project manager and now in charge of all flight
projects at JPL.

<TEXT>
   A sacred pole topped with a human scalp and
said to have the power of life and unity was presented to the Omaha
Tribe on Sunday after being held 101 years in a Boston museum.
   The pole, believed to more than 300 years old, is a symbol of
unity for the American Indian tribe. Its last keeper, Yellow Smoke,
entrusted it to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University because he
doubted younger generations of Omahas would cherish it.
   Tribal officials recently negotiated its return.
   ``It will take up where it left off in 1888,'' Tribal Chairman
Doran Morris said last month. ``It is a central part of our lives.
It will influence our children and grandchildren.''
   The pole, more than five feet long and four inches thick, is made
of pine believed to have been cut in northern Nebraska in the 1600s
or 1700s.
   At its top is a human scalp. Animal skin webbing wrapped around
the middle of the pole contains feathers and down from cranes. A
stake made from ash is at the bottom.
   The Omaha, who were buffalo hunters, had a priest, or Keeper,
carry the pole from camp to camp. He was selected from one of the
tribe's two ancient units, the Sky People or the Earth People.
   An annual renewal ceremony was held with the pole at its center
to unify the tribe.
   The renewal ceremony included exchanges of reeds, poles and
buffalo meat. Songs and images combined to remind people that the
pole stood for both a person of the tribe and the tribe as a whole.
   When the buffalo were wiped out, the Omaha settled on their
reservation in eastern Nebraska and abandoned the ceremony.
   A 1911 report by government ethnologists recounts the legend of
the pole: The son of an Omaha chief was hunting alone in the forest
when elders were in council to devise ways of keeping the tribe
together.
   He came upon a tree that was luminous but remained unconsumed by
its own light, the legend says. The tree was cut down, trimmed,
adorned with a scalp and called a human being.
   When the tribe gathered, the chiefs stood up and said, ``You now
see before you a mystery. Whenever we meet with troubles we shall
bring our troubles to him (the pole). We shall make offerings and
requests. All our prayers must be accompanied by gifts.''

welcomed the nomination of a Solidarity editor as Poland's first
non-communist prime minister, but said Tadeusz Mazowiecki faces
daunting tasks in the weeks ahead.
   ``I think this is really a revolutionary occurrence. This is the
only choice for Poland right now,'' said Wanda Cytowski, editor of
Straz, a weekly newspaper published in Scranton, Pa., whose Polish
name means ``The Guard.''
   ``The next step will be the process of gradual withdrawal of
Russian influence,'' said emigre Cecary Stolarczyk, a political
editor at the weekly newspater Gwiazda Polarna (Polar Star) in
Stevens Point, Wis.
   Cytowski and Stolarcyzk were interviewed by telephone Friday
after Mazowiecki, editor of Solidarity's weekly newspaper Tygodnik
Solidarnosc, said he had been designated prime minister. Polish
President Wojciech Jaruzelski made it official Saturday.
   The nomination must be approved by the Sejm, or lower house of
the National Assembly, which will receive the nomination Monday. The
new prime minister would then try to form a cabinet to undertake the
task of rebuilding Poland's crippled economy.
   David Franczyk, editor of the monthly Polish-American Journal in
Buffalo, N.Y., also said his magazine would push for the creation of
a ``Polish Marshall Plan'' like the U.S. effort that helped put
Western Europe back on its feet after the devestation of World War
II.
   Franczyk said the $100 million that the United States has
proposed giving Poland was ``a drop in the bucket,'' adding ``our
government should be inclined to give more money.''
   ``The most important question is whether the Western countries,
including the United States, will help Poland, not just with raw
money, but to encourage business,'' Stolarczyk said.
   Stolarczyk, who lost his job as a journalist in Poland because of
his Solidarity membership, said the union was taking a risk in
moving from the opposition to the head of the government.
   ``I believe the Communist Party functionaries countrywide will
not eagerly help the Solidarity government to run the country,'' he
said. He suggested the Communists, whose 45-year rule coincided with
near economic collapse, might try to show the opposition was
incapable of reviving the economy.
   Franczyk said the United States should seize the opportunity to
develop closer ties with Poland without provoking the Soviet Union.
   The editors said they thought Solidarity leader Lech Walesa had
made a shrewd move by not becoming prime minister. Mazowiecki is a
close adviser to Walesa.
   Cytowski said Mazowiecki's government would have to consider
unpopular measures to rebuild the Polish economy.
   The new prime minister will have to compromise to run the
government, Franczyk said. ``I think if Walesa compromises, his
message is dead.''
   Chester Grabowski, editor of the Post Eagle, a weekly
Polish-American newspaper published in Clifton, N.J., said, ``I knew
Walesa wouldn't accept it, and am glad they picked a newspaper man.''

<HEAD>A Revival of `Titus Andronicus' Opens in Central Park</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>

   ``Titus Andronicus'' must be the most difficult
of Shakespeare's plays to stage _ and to watch.
   More often than not, directors allow the violence to overwhelm
the tragedy, making the play seem like a toga-and-sandal version of
``Nightmare on Elm Street'' or ``Halloween'' with the characters
turned into ghoulish cartoons bent only on revenge. And theatergoers
are either repulsed by its gruesome and graphic violence or break
into nervous giggles over all the bloodshed and debauchery.
   Director Michael Maggio negotiates a reasonable balance between
those violent deeds and the play's personal tragedy in his striking,
straightforward production which opened over the weekend at the
Delacorte Theater in Central Park.
   Maggio, associate artistic director of Chicago's Goodman Theater,
is the real star of this production, number 11 in the New York
Shakespeare Festival's six-year marathon of all of Shakespeare's
plays.
   The director plays it straight. There's no need for any more
excess _ not in a play in which the title character allows his hand
to be cut off, his two sons are beheaded, his daughter raped and
mutilated, and he gets his revenge by serving up the children of his
chief rival in what looks like a chicken pot pie.
   ``Titus Andronicus'' is an early Shakespeare play with minimal
poetry and character development. But the promise is there _ you can
see and hear echoes of ``King Lear,'' ``Othello'' and ``Richard
III'' _ and Maggio has encouraged his strong cast to find it.
   He has coaxed a credible if subdued performance from Donald
Moffat in the title role. If the actor's portrayal lacks the steely
resolve for vengeance, he captures the man's sorrow as, one by one,
his children die. Kate Mulgrew chews the scenery _ as well as her
sons _ as the treacherous Tamora, queen of the Goths. It's a showy
role, and she revels in it.
   Keith David delivers the evening's best acting job as Aaron,
Tamora's consort. His evil is so overwhelming that it verges on
parody, but David manages to make it credible. Not an easy task.
   The rest of the cast is uneven, ranging from the moving Pamela
Gien as Titus' doomed daughter Lavinia to the embarrassing Don R.
McManus as the newly crowned emperor of Rome.
   The costumes by Lewis D. Rampino and the settings of columns by
John Lee Beatty are as traditional as the direction. But this is one
case where tradition works, illuminating a play that often seems
impossible to produce.

   Mickey Rooney and Freddie Krueger don't mix.
   That's the lesson of ``Buzzsaw Berkeley,'' the mildly amusing but
very silly slasher and let's-put-on-a-show musical that also arrived
over the weekend off-Broadway. The production at the WPA Theater,
the company that gave the world ``Little Shop of Horrors,'' offers
one funny performer, the unsinkable Ethyl Eichelberger, and not much
else.
   Eichelberger plays several parts including the title character as
well as an aging Ziegfeld Follies girl who years ago gave birth to a
homicidal maniac. Her offspring now goes around killing anybody who
decides to sing.
   That has put a crimp into the plans of Little Mickey Looney
(Keith Reddin) and Judy Gorgon (Shauna Hicks) who want to mount a
barn production of a new musical ``The History of Human
Civilization.''
   But their cast keeps dying off, done in by the mysterious killer.
Eventually the villain is caught, but it seems to take forever. Doug
Wright, who wrote the wildly uneven book, and Michael John LaChiusa,
who did the occasionally sprightly music and lyrics, spread their
spoofing a bit thin. They make fun of everything from ``Long Day's
Journey into Night'' to ``Babes in Arms'' to ``The Exorcist'' to
``The Wizard of Oz.''
   Unlike Charles Busch's hilarious ``The Lady in Question,'' done
earlier this year at the WPA, there is no consistent point of view.
``Buzzsaw Berkeley'' takes potshots at just about every movie genre
and ends up resembling none of them. It sure dilutes the fun.

   Vacationing President Bush attended
Sunday church services and prayed for the freedom of hostages held
in Lebanon, as terrorists issued new threats on the lives of two
kidnapped Americans.
   While the president went out boating later in the day, a group
called the American Lebanese Community of greater Massachusetts
demonstrated in front of his seaside home on Walker's Point, calling
for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon.
   At St. Ann's Episcopal Church, Bush and his wife, Barbara, sat in
the front pew as the Rev. Dr. Laman Bruner Jr. offered a prayer for
the freedom of American and other foreign hostages being held by
kidnappers in the Middle East, naming each one.
   He also prayed for those who have been killed, including Lt. Col.
William Higgins, the Marine whose hanging body was shown in a
videotape released last month by a pro-Iranian Moslem extremist
group.
   Meanwhile, a pro-Iranian extremist group believed to be holding
Americans Joseph Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy said Sunday it
would consider killing the two men if the French navy intervenes in
Lebanon's civil war. France said the ships were sent to be ready to
evacuate 7,000 French nationals in Lebanon if necessary.
   ``America, which is spurring France, should realize that any
foolhardiness by the French fleet will expose the life of its
hostages to danger,'' the statement by the group calling itself the
Revolutionary Justice Organization said. ``Therefore, this factor
should be taken into consideration.''
   The White House declined to comment Sunday night on the new
threats.
   The president went boating immediately after church, and was out
in his speedboat again in the late afternoon as a storm was
gathering. At the same time, about 200 peaceful protesters toting
placards made their way along the seafront road to his home.
   The signs read: ``Lebanon needs Bush,'' ``Mr. Bush react'' and
``Save democracy in Lebanon.''
   Secret Service and local police kept a watchful eye on the group,
whose leaders said they had a permit for a two-hour demonstration
near Walker's Point. They said they wanted Bush to urge world
leaders to press for removal of all foreign troops from Lebanon,
especially those of Syria, and to call for an economic embargo
against Syria.
   The group sees the ``silence of America as an O.K. to commit the
crime of the century in Lebanon,'' said Charles Bourouphael, the
organization's chairman.
   Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser, met briefly with
the group's leaders, expressed his sympathy and said he would relay
their concerns to Bush, said an administration source who declined
to be further identified.
   A pelting rainstorm hit as the protest was about to break up.
   The storm also caught the president and some of his children who
took his speedboat out on the ocean.
   The president began his day with a two-mile jog despite a morning
downpour that let up just before he started off with daughter
Dorothy, three reporters and two White House staff members.
   It was his first jog since he arrived for the seaside vacation
Wednesday. He plans to return to Washington on Sept. 4.
   The president and Mrs. Bush have been surrounded thus far at
their Walker's Point home by their five children and 11
grandchildren for sunny days filled with tennis, swimming and
boating.
   They were accompanied to the church service by several of the
clan and Bush's mother, Dorothy Walker Bush. The 88-year-old Mrs.
Bush was helped from the presidential limousine and into the church
by the president and his wife.
   As they left, the president, dressed in an emerald green jacket
and cadet blue slacks, called out, ``Off to fishing.''
   When the motorcade arrived back at his house just a few moments
away, Secret Service agents had his speed boat Fidelity ready to go
and were waiting in protection boats that accompany the presidential
fishing excursions.
   Bush headed off to sea as he has done every day of his vacation.
   Outside the church he spotted a friend and engaged him in a quick
exchange about fishing gear, asked if he was going out, then told
him to ``call me.''
   He stood in his limousine door and waved to a small crowd of
onlookers that gathered to see him come out.

<HEAD>Artillery Duels Across Beirut Kill Three, Shatter Lull</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ear-splitting blasts rocked Beirut late
Sunday as Syrian and Christian gunners began an artillery battle
across the divided city, killing three people and shattering a
24-hour lull.
   The Syrians opened up against the Christian coastline north of
Beirut, claiming that ships carrying arms were trying to unload in
Christian ports.
   Police said Christian forces struck back with sustained barrages
of 155mm howitzers aimed at Syrian gun emplacements in and around
Moslem west Beirut.
   The duels followed gunfire and rocket-propelled clashes across
Beirut's dividing Green Line that pierced a day of calm in the
latest round of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Police said that in addition to the dead, eight people were
wounded.
   That brought the overall toll to 784 people killed and 2,126
killed since the confrontation broke out March 8 between army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 mainly Christian units and
Syria's 40,000 peacekeeping troops in lebanon.
   Police also reported exchanges of tank fire between Aoun's troops
and the Syrians, backed by Druse Moslem allies, at the strategic
hilltop of Souk el-Gharb southeast of Beirut.
   The Christians last week beat back a Syrian ground attack on the
long-deserted mountain resort, which controls a strategic road
network into the Christian enclave.
   A police spokesman said hostilities were considerably less
intense than the shelling duels that terrorized Beirut's Moslem and
Christian sectors in the week before the U.N. Security Council
called for a cease-fire on Tuesday.
   The artillery battles have driven more than 1.3 million of the
Beirut's 1.5 million residents to safety in southern Lebanon.
   The shelling started after Aoun imposed a naval blockade on
illegal Moslem militia-run ports to salvage lost customs dues of
about $100 million annually.
   In retaliation, the Syrians joined the Moslem militias in
shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north of Beirut and
blocking its land exits.
   Aoun is receiving military supplies from Iraq, a foe of Syria.
The two countries are ruled by rival factions of the Arab Baath
socialist party.
   On Sunday, the Iraqi Bath party denounced Syria's role in Lebanon
and called for Arabs to demonstrate against Syrian President Hafez
Assad.
   ``All Arabs are called upon to take immediately to the streets
everywhere to express their solidarity and sympathy with Lebanon,''
said the statement, issued in Baghdad. ``Tell the criminal (Assad)
to leave Lebanon.''
   In Oviedo, Spain, Pope John Paul II Sunday accused sectarian
fighters in Lebanon of trying to wreck Beirut and pleaded for a
cease-fire. The appeal came as the Vatican studied the possibility
of a papal peace mission to Lebanon.
   ``In the name of God, I renew my urgent call to all responsible
authorities for harmony and an immediate cease-fire, so that a
dialogue can begin leading to an accord in which the legitimate
historical and religious rights of all parties are taken into
account,'' said the pontiff, on a three-day visit to Spain.
   Also Sunday, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group said it would
consider killing its two American hostages if the French navy
intervenes in Lebanon.
   France has dispatched an aircraft carrier and a destroyer to the
eastern Mediterranean, reportedly to evacuate 7,000 French nationals
from war-battered Lebanon if the need arises.
   But French President Francois Mitterrand said Sunday that France
has no intention of intervening militarily.
   In a news conference in El Escorial, Spain, Mitterrand said
France has ``taken the precaution of sending a mission of support
and to safeguard lives.''
   ``It is necessary to intensify diplomatic pressure'' to defend
the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon, he said.

   Israeli troops shot and killed an Arab and
Palestinians armed with knives and axes hacked to death a Gaza man
who refused to hand over his Israeli-issued identity card, Arab
reports said Sunday.
   The cards are the focus of a power struggle between the army and
Arab uprising leaders. Israeli authorities require that Arabs in the
occupied Gaza Strip carry the cards to enter Israel.
   In clashes in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank
Sunday, troops shot and wounded at least 15 Palestinians, Arab
hospital officials said. They said nine others were injured by
rubber-coated metal pellets.
   The military confirmed six Arabs were wounded by army gunfire.
   Also Sunday in Jerusalem, a Palestinian youth stabbed an Israeli
soldier four times, slightly wounding him in the chest. The soldier
was identified as Mordechai Kahane, a nephew of American-born Rabbi
Meir Kahane, leader of an anti-Arab political party.
   ``He fell on me and and grabbed me and cried Allahu Akbar (God is
great) and I felt a pain,'' the soldier said on army radio.
   Arieh Bibi, the city's police chief, said an 18-year-old Arab was
arrested and told investigators he carried out the knifing in
revenge for an Israeli attack on a cousin.
   In the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, 15-year-old Walid
Salem Shamas was fatally wounded in the chest in a clash with
soldiers, Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed his death and said the military was
investigating.
   In the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah, Palestinian activists
fatally attacked Salem Suleiman El Oud, 36, with axes and knives
Saturday night after he refused to hand over his computerized travel
permit to Israel, Arab reports said. An army spokesman confirmed the
killing.
   Oud was also suspected of cooperating with Israeli authorities,
Arab reports said.
   During the 20-month-old uprising, 97 Arabs have been killed by
fellow Palestinians because they were suspected of collaborating
with Israel. At least 539 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis,
and 38 Israelis also have been slain.
   Israeli authorities have required all residents of Gaza to have
new computerized cards to enter Israel starting Friday. Uprising
leaders have been collecting the cards to disrupt the new Israeli
system.
   Arab reporters who counted cars Sunday estimated that about 1,100
of the 40,000 workers left for work in Israel. The small number was
attributed to a two-week strike against the new card system called
by the uprising leaders.
   A 48-year-old construction worker who would give only his first
name, Khalil, told a reporter that members of an underground
``popular committee'' confiscated his card and he could not work in
Israel.
   ``I have 14 children. If I stop working in Israel, how are they
going to eat?'' he said. He refused to give his full name for fear
of reprisals.
   In the West Bank, Palestinian youths set up roadblocks Sunday to
stop laborers from going to jobs in Israel. Some workers said they
were refusing to honor a one-week strike call in sympathy with Gazan
laborers because they needed money to feed their families.
   Several workers in the Jalazoun refugee camp near Ramallah said
their car was stopped and set ablaze Thursday night by 50 masked
youths who took their identity cards to prevent them from going to
work during the one-week strike.
   In the Amari refugee camp, also near Ramallah, residents said
almost all men with jobs in Israel went to work Sunday.

<HEAD>Exxon Fires Up Incinerator To Burn Waste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A barge-mounted incinerator underwent
tests Sunday in preparation for burning tons of oily debris
collected from beaches fouled by the nation's biggest oil spill.
   Waste burning was to begin Monday, said Exxon Corp. spokesman
John Nicholls, whose company's tanker ran onto a reef March 24,
spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil.
   The incinerator's temperature was being increased Sunday,
Nicholls said. ``It takes quite a lot of time,'' he said.
   Testing began Saturday, but was delayed by technical problems,
the spokesman said.
   The incinerator is to be used to burn tons of debris, including
vegetation from the shore and absorbent material used by cleanup
crews to soak up crude from beaches on Kodiak Island and nearby
islands.
   Kodiak is more than 300 miles from Valdez, the port from which
the tanker Exxon Valdez set out the day of the wreck.
   The waste will be burned in two phases. A first burn will reach
temperatures of more than 1,500 degrees. A second burning of vapors
and minute particles will require temperatures higher than 1,800
degrees, Nicholls said.
   With Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation engineer
Mark Martinson watching, the incinerator was heated Sunday by
burning diesel fuel.
   ``Right now, it's a 24-hour test burn,'' said Martinson. ``If
that goes all right then they'll start trash-burning.''
   The company had planned to start Saturday by burning waste barged
to a point off the Kodiak Island community of Port Lions.
   The arrangement angered some Port Lions residents, who said they
feared pollution might result. They unsuccessfully pressed the state
to shut down the incinerator.
   Seven private vessels from the area circled the barge Saturday to
protest the plan, said Port Lions Councilman Ralph Cone.
   The state conservation agency announced Friday that the operation
qualified for a permit, and denied that the burning posed a health
threat. Because of the Port Lions residents' concerns, however, the
agency urged Exxon to put the incinerator elsewhere.
   Nicholls said it was unlikely the incinerator would be moved,
saying ``we have a valid permit to operate where it is.''

   Thousands of people waved white
handerchiefs and cried farewell Sunday to presidential candidate
Luis Carlos Galan, slain by professional killers working for drug
traffickers.
   An estimated 50,000 people, some carrying flowers and national
flags and crying out for justice, joined in the funeral procession
from the capital building to the national cathedral.
   Galan, 46, a Liberal Party senator, was the party's leading
presidential candidate in elections set for May. Galan was shot down
Friday night by seven armed thugs as he was about to address a
campaign rally near Bogota.
   He was buried with state honors, mourned by government and
political dignitaries, grieving family members and thousands of
ordinary citizens.
   The funeral ceremonies began Sunday morning with a violin recital
organized by schoolmates of Galan's oldest son, 17-year-old Juan
Manuel.
   At midday, the flag-draped coffin was taken from the capital to
the cathedral, accompanied by thousands of people singing the
national anthem.
   Before beginning the service, Cardinal Mario Revollo Bravo read a
message from Pope John Paul II condemming the murder and appealing
to drug traffickers to end their violence.
   The pontiff's message said in part, ``The murder commited by drug
traffickers against Luis Carlos Galan has provoked in me sentiments
of pain and reprobation, to see how the children of one nation can
transgress against one of their brothers.''
   President Virgilio Barco and his Cabinet ministers attended the
funeral ceremonies beside Galan's widow, Gloria Pachon, his three
sons and parents.
   The coffin was taken from the cathedral and the procession, with
police and military units posted along the road, moved from the
cathedral to Bogota's Central Cemetery.
   At the cemetery, as the coffin was lowered, many of the thousands
of people present chanted, ``Galan is still here!''

   A judge ruled against a lesbian couple who
challenged a referendum on the city's ``domestic partners'' law,
clearing the way for a vote on the ordinance recognizing homosexual
and other unmarried unions.
   Michael Imfeld, an attorney representing one of the two
conservative clergymen who sponsored the November referendum, said
he was notified Saturday of Superior Court Judge Ira Brown's ruling
the day before.
   The law, which would allow homosexual and other unmarried couples
to register their relationships, was to have taken effect July 6 but
was suspended when the clergymen succeeded in putting the issue on
the Nov. 7 ballot.
   The lesbian couple, Cindy Bologna and Sydney Erskine, challenged
the referendum.
   ``We did not expect that they'd be able to keep voters from
voting on it. I was surprised they even tried,'' said Imfeld.
   Neither Bologna nor Erskine could be reached immediately for
comment.
   Imfeld represents the Rev. Charles McIllhenny of the First
Orthodox Presbyterian Church. McIllhenny and Rabbi Lionel Feldman
mounted a petition drive to put the law to a vote.

   A barge rammed into a pleasure boat, sheared off
the top deck and sank it in the River Thames early Sunday, killing
at least 26 people, police said. At least 78 people survived.
   The barge's captain and second mate were arrested, but police
later said the two would not be detained. It was not clear whether
charges would be filed.
   Police Commander John Purnell, speaking at Scotland Yard, said
the there were 26 people known dead, including one woman found
upstream. Most of the dead were teen-agers or in their 20s, he said.
   Earlier, police said 29 bodies had been found and there were 87
survivors. There was no explanation given for the discrepancy.
   The detective heading the inquiry, Michael Purchase, said earlier
the toll could be as high as 60.
   ``It could be days or even weeks before the full extent of the
tragedy is known,'' Purnell said.
   Scotland Yard said the engine room and bilges had still to be
searched for bodies. It said salvage crews found no survivors.
   Police said 78 people got off the vessel alive but it was unclear
how many people boarded the luxury river cruiser when it sailed at 1
a.m. on a clear, warm night, planning to return at dawn.
   The uncertainty of the casualty toll arose from the absence of a
passenger list and conflicting estimates of the numbers of people
aboard. Scotland Yard said the boat, licensed for 149 passengers and
two crew, was carrying 120 to 150 people. Ken Dwan, owner of the
Marchioness' company, said there were no more than 110.
   Guests had been celebrating the 26th birthday party for London
banker Antonio Vasconcellos when it sank near Southwark Bridge, in
the heart of the capital, friends said. Vasconcellos was unaccounted
for, police said.
   Dwan said the collision between the 80-ton double-decker river
boat and a dredger 18 times heavier was like ``a tank rolling over''
a small car.
   An inspection by divers showed the vessel's top deck was sheared
off.
   The huge Thames Barrier, built across the river near its mouth to
control seasonal flooding, was lowered to hold back the tide and
ease the treacherous conditions under which rescuers worked.
   The five additional crew members of the 1,475-ton Bowbelle, a
sand-and-gravel dredging barge, were questioned as witnesses about
the collision, Scotland Yard said.
   Survivors said people were dancing, socializing and enjoying the
floating birthday party when the Bowbelle, one of the largest
registered vessels on the Thames, crashed into the rear of the
Marchioness, knocking it sideways, then hitting it again and running
straight over it.
   The Marchioness sank within two minutes in 25 feet of water and
came to rest near Southwark Bridge, in central London's financial
district, shortly before 2 a.m., police said.
   Survivors said the 85-foot-long Marchioness, built during World
War II, was privately chartered by a London modeling agency,
Synchro. Vasconcellos was the guest of honor. The connection between
the agency and Vasconcellos was not immediately clear.
   Many of those dancing on the top deck jumped or were thrown
overboard, shouting and screaming, and battled strong tides to reach
shore. Others, disco-dancing below deck, were trapped.
   Art student Mike Mosbacher, 22, said he dived out of an open
window on the top deck when he saw the barge coming.
   ``It hit us in the side, smashed into us and went straight over
us,'' he said. ``The people downstairs, there's no way they would
have got out.''
   Survivors were taken to three local hospitals. Doctors said the
most serious injury was a broken leg.
   ``Everyone had been quite relaxed,'' said Annette Russell, 26.
``People were chatting and dancing to the music. It all happened
terribly quickly. We were rammed from behind ... and as we tried to
get out of the situation, I think the tide took the boat over and it
turned and sank.''
   The government ordered an inquiry and the search continued. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher returned from vacation in Austria and
immediately boarded a river patrol boat to visit the scene. Queen
Elizabeth II, vacationing in Scotland, sent condolences.
   The 260-foot-long Bowbelle, operated by South Coast Shipping,
works in the Thames estuary and the North Sea, a spokesman for the
firm said. He would not comment on the tragedy.

<TEXT>
   Premier Miklos Nemeth on Sunday
condemned Hungary's participation in the Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia that 21 years ago crushed Prague's communist-led
reforms.
   At a rally, Nemeth said Hungary has proposed the Soviet bloc
alliance introduce measures that would make similar military
intervention impossible.
   Nemeth said the world had moved beyond the 1968 invasion of
Czechoslovakia and the 1956 Soviet intervention in Hungary that
crushed an anti-Stalinist uprising.
   Hungary is making its own broad economic and political reforms,
which include national elections to be held next year.
   Nemeth's speech, which marked the day of St. Stephen _ the
founder of the Hungarian state _ was carried by television and radio.
   ``The Hungarian government condemns the participation in the 1968
Czechoslovak military intervention,'' Nemeth told a crowd at
Csegled, 50 miles east of Budapest.
   The ruling Communist Party last week denounced the invasion of
Czechoslovakia, provoking an angry response from Prague.
   Czechoslovak Communist leaders oppose the wide-ranging reforms
under way in Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union.
   Nemeth said he believed Hungary's Warsaw Pact initiative would
contribute ``to better relations among the Czech, Slovak and
Hungarian peoples.''
   ``We need stable reliable partners among the socialist countries
... even though they may not follow the same path as Hungary,''
Nemeth said. ``All revolutions in Hungarian history were repressed
by some foreign power, but now we have a historic chance to take a
new course.''
   Nemeth also reiterated the dedication of Communist Party
reformers to change.
   He said goals of the ruling party included the ``creation of a
genuine democracy, a constitutional state, a market economy, respect
for private property, allowing free enterprise and religious
freedom, supporting church and community autonomy, and respect for
traditional values.''
   These are also included in a draft party program published in the
weekend edition of the party's daily, Nepszabadsag.
   The draft is to be presented at the party's congress on Oct. 6.
The congress is likely to pit Communist reformers against those
resistant to change.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said Saturday the party should ``get
rid of people who obstruct the implementation of reform,'' the state
news agency MTI reported.

   Romania on Sunday denounced the emergence
of a Polish government led by non-Communists and said it could
jeoparize East bloc communism and even the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
alliance.
   The Romanian Communist Party newspaper Scinteia, in an article on
the unprecedented political developments in Poland, said the
nomination of Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki for prime
minister was ``counter to the Polish people's interests.''
   It described Mazowiecki as a person ``known for his
anti-socialist positions, connected with imperialist, reactionary
circles.''
   ``With good reason public opinion in Romania shows its concern
over such an evolution,'' it said.
   The article was carried by the Romanian state news agency
Agerpres, monitored in Vienna.
   It was the harshest criticism any of the East bloc countries have
made of Poland.
   News reports of Mazowiecki's nomination Saturday by Communist
President Wojciech Jaruzelski was restrained in East Germany,
Czechslovakia and Bulgaria.
   The Soviets' official Tass news agency carried a dispatch
Saturday saying Poland's Communist officials complained of the
``confrontational actions of the leaders of the opposition.''
   Yugoslavia has been relative independent of the Soviet bloc, and
the Tanjug News agency said the nomination of Mazowiecki put the
Polish government crisis in ``calmer waters.'' The Hungarian news
media mainly reported the developments.
   Scinteia said the situation in Poland ``places in jeopardy the
interests of socialism, of the Warsaw Treaty included.''
   It said Mazowiecki's nomination serves the interests of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and ``the most reactionary forces.''
   ``The Romanian people ... believe that everything possible should
be done for a government to be formed by the (Communist Party) ...
to ensure the collaboration with the socialist countries,'' the
article said.
   It added Romania was confident that the Polish Communist Party
``will be able to overcome the difficulties that emerged of late and
will work firmly for the triumph of the ideas of socialism.''
   Romania, under the leadership of President Nicolae Ceausescu, has
often been a maverick in the Soviet bloc and was the only Warsaw
Pact member that refused to pariticpate in the Soviet-led invasion
of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   But it has been rigidly resistant to any liberalization and
Ceausescu has repeatedly expressed concern over reforms in the
Soviet Union, Hungary and other East bloc countries. The news media
has made little mention of the recent developments in Poland.
   Poland's Communist Party Central Committee, in a resolution
released Sunday, stressed the nation's continued membership in the
Warsaw Pact military alliance. Solidarity has said it would not
undermine the pact.

   A generation of Americans has grown up without
realizing the sacrifices made by the nation's veterans, members of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars were told in memorial services Sunday.
   Maj. Gen. John McDonough, the Air Force Chief of Chaplains, said
he was fearful that Memorial Day, a day set aside to honor America's
war dead, may be losing its meaning to the nation's young.
   ``Who will keep alive the dreams of freedom and justice in the
future, when the veterans of our wars are no longer alive?''
McDonough asked.
   McDonough made his comments in memorial services marking the
start of the 90th annual VFW convention. Some 25,000 members are
gathered here for one of the largest turnouts in recent years.
   Vice President Dan Quayle is scheduled to address the group
Monday morning, after which members are expected to consider more
than two dozen resolutions opposing desecration of the American flag.
   McDonough told a memorial service for fallen comrades that new
generations of Americans who have not experienced war cannot
appreciate the sacrifices of America's veterans.
   ``Each generation must take up the duty of safeguarding the
nation, and that sense of obligation comes from remembering those
who fulfilled that duty in the past,'' McDonough said.
   The convention is expected to be the largest in recent memory,
according to Wade LaDue, public relations director of the
2-million-member organization.
   Other activities will include speeches by Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney and Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward Derwinski.
   The convention will also honor U.S. Navy pilots who shot down
Libyan MiG jets in a confrontation over the Mediterranean Sea on
Jan. 4, 1989.
   Monday afternoon, the veterans were to begin considering some 500
resolutions covering a wide range of issues. Topping the list will
be flag desecration. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling June 21 said
burning the American flag as a political protest was protected by
the First Amendment guarantee of free speech.
   ``This will be the convention's most emotional issue,'' LaDue
said.

   A prominent Vietnamese writer shot by
assailants as he walked near his home recently had been threatened
and accused of secretly joining communist factions.
   Doan Toai, 42, the political organizer who co-authored the 1986
book ``The Vietnamese Gulag,'' was shot four times in the head and
upper body by two men in a car Saturday morning, said Sheriff's Sgt.
Oliver Moon.
   Toai was moved to an undisclosed location where his condition was
serious, Moon said.
   One theory among Vietnamese activists is that Toai was shot by
anti-communist ``fanatics'' who wanted to kill him because he
proposed diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam,
said Dam Phuong Tran, president of the Vietnamese Committee for
Human Rights in Washington, who said she has known Toai for more
than 15 years..
   But he had detractors on the other side of the political fence as
well, and it was possible he was shot by communist agents, Tran
added.
   Toai co-authored both ``The Vietnamese Gulag'' and ``Portrait of
the Enemy'' with writer David Chanoff and is executive director of
the Institute for Democracy in Vietnam.
   The writer was shot by two men described as Asian and driving a
station wagon, Moon said. Sheriff's investigators have not been able
to talk to Toai because of his condition, Moon said.
   Toai, originally from South Vietnam, came to the United States as
a refugee in 1978 after he was released from a ``re-education'' camp
in Vietnam, Tran said.
   Last year, Toai organized a panel discussion on U.S.-Vietnamese
relations involving several members of Congress, scholars and
writers.
   ``He is trying to do whatever he can do to improve the situation
in Vietnam,'' said Tran.

<TEXT>
   An estimated 30,000 people rallied
Sunday in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro to protest inflation
and growing poverty.
   Speakers at the demonstration in the town of Niksic criticized
the government of Premier Ante Markovic that has sought to revive
Yugoslavia's stagnant economy by encouraging market-oriented reforms.
   Ljubisa Stankovic, a member of the presidency of Montenegro, told
the crowd that ``incomprehensible inflation is blocking Yugoslavia's
progress.''
   ``The people of Montenegro cannot support a government that
threatens its existence,'' he said in remarks carried on national
television.
   Markovic, who took office in March, has been denounced in Serbia,
Yugoslavia's largest republic, and in neighboring Montenegro for his
economic reforms.
   But he has received support in Slovenia and Croatia, the most
prosperous of the country's six republics.
   Another speaker at the Niksic demonstration, steel-plant worker
Aleksandar Roganovic, said the rally was the last time the people
would assemble peacefully to draw attention to their demands. ``We
cannot go on like this ... we are hungry,'' he said.
   In January, the entire Montenegrin Communist Party leadership was
removed and replaced after more than 120,000 people demonstrated in
Titograd, the region's capital, protesting economic conditions.
   Yugolavia is struggling with an annual inflation rate of nearly
800 percent.

   A three-nation rescue team found the
wreckage of a Nicaraguan cargo plane that disappeared more than a
year ago, the Defense Ministry said Sunday.
   The remains of the Costa Rican pilot, Argentine co-pilot and four
Nicaraguan crew members were taken from the wreckage in Panama on
Saturday, the ministry communique said.
   The Aeronica DC-6, carrying a full load of cargo, crashed on
Fabregas Mountain in Panama near the Costa Rican border on May 24,
1988, while on a flight from Panama City to Managua. It was not
immediately clear what cargo the plane was carrying.
   The cause of the crash has not been determined.
   Authorities organized a new search for the plane after a
Panamanian pilot on a training flight last week reported sighting
wreckage.
   About 35 members of salvage crews from Panama, Costa Rica and
Nicaragua, using two Nicaraguan helicopters and a Costa Rican light
plane, searched for three days before finding the wreckage, the
ministry said.

   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole met Sunday in
Morocco with Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and pledged
continued congressional aid for his group's ``freedom fighters.''
   ``In Afghanistan, Congress stuck with the resistance until the
Soviets had to withdraw, while in Nicaragua Congress pulled the plug
on the Contras and as a result, I'm afraid we've lost a lot of our
leverage on the Sandinistas. I hope in Angola we follow the path we
did in Afghanistan, not Nicaragua,'' the Kansas Republican said in a
statement from Rabat read by aide Walt Riker.
   Dole was in Morocco on the first leg of a four-nation trip that
will take him to Soviet Armenia, Poland and the Netherlands. Savimbi
was there for meetings to explain the position of his National Union
for Total Independence of Angola group, known as UNITA, about
recently convened talks aimed at ending Angola's 14-year civil war.
   Savimbi and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos agreed June
22 to a cease-fire and negotiations. The guerrillas have been
fighting to share control with the government since the Marxists
took power and declared a one-party state shortly after Angola's
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Under the terms of a U.S.-mediated peace agreement signed in
Angola last December, South Africa and Cuba pledged to halt aid to
the guerrillas and grant independence to Angola's southern neighbor,
Namibia. In return, about 50,000 Cuban troops supporting the Angolan
government began a gradual withdrawal from Angola.
   The United States has continued to supply Savimbi's group with
about $15 million a year.
   ``Dole told Savimbi on Sunday he was confident that Congress
would continue to support aid to UNITA, as long as massive Soviet
aid flows to the communist regime which Savimbi has been battling
for more than a decade,'' Riker said, referring to the guerrillas as
``freedom fighters.''
   ``Our goal has always been the establishment of a government in
Angola that really reflects the will of the people,'' Riker quoted
Dole as saying to Savimbi. ``That means free elections and we're not
going to back away from that goal and that demand _ period.''

<TEXT>
   Opposition and government leaders, in
a deadlock over the issue of who will govern the country after Sept.
1, exchanged ideas through Organization of American States mediators
in separate meetings Sunday.
   ``It's zero to zero with the last half of the last inning left,''
said Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian Democratic
Party.
   Calderon was an opposition vice presidential candidate in the May
7 elections that were annulled by the government controlled by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega. He spoke with reporters during a lunch break
in the talks.
   The opposition wants to take power Sept. 1, when acting President
Manuel Solis Palma's term expires. It also is demanding that Noriega
step down as commander of Panama's Defense Forces.
   The government has proposed a provisional government, including
the opposition, and has said Noriega will not resign.
   International observers of the May balloting said the opposition
was winning by a landslide when Noriega had the election annulled.
   ``There's no agreement on basic points,'' said Guillermo Endara,
who ran for president on the opposition ticket.
   Romulo Escobar Betancourt, a government representative, was more
optimistic.
   ``A series of proposals have begun to move'' he said. ``There's
an atmosphere for presenting proposals and counterproposals.''
   On Saturday, the negotiations switched from direct talks to
separate meetings with the four-member OAS team.
   One of the OAS delegates, Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez of
Ecuador, said the two sides were talking more freely with the
mediators shuttling ideas back and forth. He would not say what was
discussed Sunday.
   The team is to report on its progress at an OAS meeting in
Washington Wednesday.
   The United States has been pressuring Noriega to step down since
February 1988, when he was indicted by federal grand juries in
Florida on charges involving drug trafficking.
   Noriega has denied the allegations and claims they are part of an
effort by the United States to avoid turning over control of the
Panama Canal to Panama at the end of 1999 as called for in a treaty.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Sunday that Washington supports the
OAS efforts ``to resolve the crisis based on the mandate from the
meeting of (OAS) foreign ministers and will continue supporting them
in their efforts, in all the appropriate ways.''

   Police and soldiers rounded up nearly
10,000 suspects in an unprecedented nationwide crackdown on cocaine
traffickers blamed for the assassination of leading presidential
candidate Luis Carlos Galan, officials said Sunday.
   Tens of thousands of people, many openly weeping and calling out
for justice, packed downtown streets for Galan's funeral Sunday.
President Virgilio Barco characterized him as a martyr in an
intensifying war on the fearsome drug underworld.
   According to a Defense Ministry communique issued Sunday night,
police and military authorities have rounded up 9,896 suspects,
raided 298 homes of suspected drug dealers and seized 330 arms and
about four tons of cocaine since Barco announced emergency crackdown
measures Friday.
   The statement said 1,023 cars and trucks also were confiscated in
the sweep, which included raids at the posh and well-guarded estates
and other properties of several suspected cocaine chieftains,
including Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Rodriguez Gacha and Jorge Ochoa.
   There were no reports that the leaders of the Medellin cocaine
cartel were arrested.
   Assassins believed hired by the drug cartel gunned down Galan, a
46-year-old Liberal Party senator and presidential candidate, during
a Friday night political rally in the town of Soacha, 20 miles south
of Bogota.
   The death capped a 48-hour wave of assassinations that also
included a provincial commander of the national police force and a
Bogota magistrate. All of the victims were active in combating drugs.
   In Washington, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh expressed support
Sunday for sending U.S. troops to Colombia to help fight drug lords.
   ``I think we have to look at any request that we get for either
law enforcement or military assistance seriously,'' he said on NBC's
``Meet the Press'' program.
   About 50,000 Colombians lined downtown streets for Galan's
funeral procession, waving white handkerchiefs and singing the
national anthem as the flag-draped coffin was carried from the
capital building to the national cathedral.
   At Galan's funeral service, Barco declared: ``Galan's and his
party's fight against the criminal narcotics trafficking
organization was frontal and without concessions. The threats did
not take him from his commitment.''
   ``Every Colombian and foreigner who takes drugs must remember
they are helping those who assassinated Galan and hundreds of others
in this battle,'' he said.
   The president described his country as ``the biggest victim of an
international organization dedicated to the crime of drug
trafficking, the most gigantic and powerful such organization that
has ever existed.''
   His emergency measures included extradition of proven drug
traffickers to the United States. Barco, in his speech at the
funeral service, called for ``international solidarity'' in fighting
the drug problem.
   At the cemetery, as the coffin was lowered, thousands of
Colombians chanted, ``Galan is still here!''
   In a message to the Colombian people published in the Vatican
newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, Pope John Paul II expressed ``pain''
over the assassination and called for an end to the drug scourge.
   Galan, considered the leading Liberal Party candidate for the May
1990 presidential elections, had survived previous attempts on his
life. Police said drug traffickers had offered $500,000 for his
death.
   According to press reports, Escobar Gaviria, the head of the
Medellin drug cartel that reportedly supplies most of the United
States and Europe with cocaine, traveled to Panama earlier this week
after ordering a series of killings, including Galan's.
   The drug cartels announced Saturday they would step up violence
in a bid to force the government to negotiate with them, although
they have never publicly stated their demands in detail.
   In a communique released to radio stations, the cartels said
``now the fight is with blood'' and vowed to oppose any government
moves to bring them to justice.
   The statement was signed ``The Extraditables,'' a reference to
those drug leaders wanted in the United States.
   Drug kingpins have lived in Colombia under cover for the last
decade without any major interference from authorities.
   Galan's death brought renewed calls for firmer action, including
a military campaign on the drug strongholds scattered throughout
this remote, mountainous country.
   Political support for stronger measures seemed limited, however,
with some political leaders calling for direct negotiations with the
cartels.
   ``We have tried many measures without success. Now is the time
for dialogue,'' said Juan Gomez Martinez, the mayor of Medellin. The
city is known as one of the most violent in the world and a center
for drug activities in Colombia.
   In a related development, 4,500 judges called off a strike and
vowed to double their efforts to bring drug dealers to justice.
   Since 1981, about 220 judges and court employees have been
killed, mostly by thugs working for the drug cartels, according to
the Association of Judicial System Employees, the court worker's
union.
   The government's new anti-drug program includes more money to
protect judges and court workers.

   Negotiators reached a tentative agreement
Sunday on a three-year contract for 42,500 striking telephone
workers in California and Nevada, some of whom returned to their
jobs almost immediately.
   The workers covered by the pact with Pacific Telesis are among
200,000 members of the Communications Workers of America on strike
at so-called ``Baby Bell'' regional phone companies in the West,
East and Midwest.
   ``Our people basically are very happy; we haven't heard such loud
shouting of joy since they've gone out,'' CWA Local 9415 President
Jessie Wilson said by by telephone from union headquarters as
workers cheered in the background.
   Meanwhile, the strike at Bell Atlantic, which covers six
mid-Atlantic states and Washington, D.C., moved a step closer to
agreement Sunday when the company's Pennsylvania subsidiary settled
with one of two striking unions. Strikes continued at NYNEX, serving
New York and the Northeast; and Ameritech, which covers five
Midwestern states. No talks were scheduled Sunday in those two
strikes.
   All four regional companies have continued service by replacing
striking operators, technical and clerical workers with management
personnel, but there have been delays for installation and operator
services.
   The tentative three-year pact at Pacific Telesis was approved by
negotiators at 1:15 a.m. Sunday, 16 days into the strike that
affected 13.2 million customers at PacTel subsidiaries Pacific Bell
and Nevada Bell Telephone Co.
   Most of the strikers were expected to be back on the job within
24 hours, said CWA spokeswoman Vira Milirides. Pacific Bell
spokeswoman Lynn Jimenez said strikers would begin returning to work
Sunday night.
   Jimenez said thousands of workers contacted shift supervisors
with the intention of returning to work Sunday night. She had no
figures on employees who had already returned to their jobs. Jimenez
expected a ``nearly full complement'' on Monday shifts.
   The union walked out over a company proposal that employees bear
a share of health-care insurance premiums.
   The contract would allow PacTel to establish a network of doctors
and hospitals which would meet employee health needs at little or no
cost to workers, according to a statement by Pacific Bell. The pact
allows workers to see doctors outside the network, but they would
have to pay more.
   Wage and bonus hikes and other financial provisions of the
contract will raise salaries an average of 11 percent over the life
of the contract, Wilson said.
   Under the contract, workers would receive a 3.1 percent pay hike
the first year, followed by raises of 3.7 percent and 2.6 percent in
the next two years, according to a statement by Pacific Bell.
   Employee pay now ranges from $228 a week for some operators to
$650 for some skilled technicians, according to union figures.
   Although the contract must still be approved by membership, a
ratification vote isn't expected for several weeks.
   Jimenez said the company, which employs 41,800 of the strikers,
asked some 17,000 managers to remain at temporary job assignments
this week.
   ``We have company economists being directory assistance operators
and we're asking them to stay for the time being so we can maintain
the same level of good service that we've been able to offer through
the strike,'' Jimenez said.
   Pacific Bell serves California and parts of Nevada. Nevada Bell
Telephone Co., also a subsidiary of San Francisco-based Pacific
Telesis, has 745 workers, one-third of whom crossed picket lines.
   The strike at Pacific Telesis began at 11:59 p.m. on Aug. 5, when
the last contract expired.
   During the walkout, there were 450 serious acts of sabotage or
vandalism, said PacTel spokesman Terry Mulready. Rewards of $10,000
to $25,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction
remain in effect, Mulready said.
   In Philadelphia, representatives of the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers reached a tentative agreement Sunday with Bell
of Pennsylvania.
   The subsidiary announced the settlement was similar to a deal
reached Thursday between the CWA and Bell Atlantic.
   But IBEW workers will stay off the job until Bell of Pennsylvania
settles local issues with the CWA and an agreement is reached
between the IBEW and sister company New Jersey Bell, officials said.
   ``It's a step forward, but we're not really going anywhere,''
said Chuck Schalch, a Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman. ``We're hoping
the CWA isn't far behind.''
   Bell of Pennsylvania's tentative deal with the 1,900 IBEW members
calls for a 7.5 percent pay increase over the life of the proposed
three-year contract, a profit-sharing plan that could yield as much
as $600 a year per worker and a new health-care arrangement intended
to hold down costs, Bell of Pennsylvania said.
   In another development, New York Telephone Co., a NYNEX
subsidiary, reported discovering 13 cases of burned or cut phone
lines in New York state and Connecticut on Saturday and Sunday.
Company spokesman Peter Muller said it was unusual for so many lines
to be vandalized, but would not link the destruction to the
2-week-old walkout.

<HEAD>Government-Owned Mine Ends Contract Talks by Declaring Bankruptcy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government abruptly ended contract talks
at Mexico's largest copper mine, declaring it bankrupt and
dispatching soldiers to guard the premises.
   A bankruptcy judge declared the Cananea Mining Co., located 25
miles south of the Arizona border, insolvent after management said
it could not meet expenses, much less give in to the union's demands.
   The union had demanded a 60 percent wage increase, a shorter work
week, longer vacations and an extensive benefits package that
Cananea Mining Co. said would have meant a 330 percent raise for
each miner.
   Cananea's 3,000 workers threatened to strike on Aug. 28 if the
contract negotiations were not resolved. The talks began on June 24.
   The national development agency that owns Cananea, Nafinsa, said
soldiers ``intervened'' to take care of hazardous materials,
including 70 tons of dynamite, stored on mine premises.
   There is a long history of labor conflict at Cananea and tensions
have been particularly high since the government decided to sell the
mine to private investors.
   Two deals to sell Cananea have fallen through since last year
and, according to reports in the financial press this week, the
government believed the mine would be more attractive to buyers
without an expensive union contract.
   Layoffs were to begin immediately, Cananea said in a statement.
   Cananea said the mine would reopen when the international copper
market improved. A new workforce would then be hired, according to
the statement.
   Both the state and federal governments were to undertake
development programs in the company town of Cananea to ease its
dependence on the mine, the statement said. About 25,000 people live
in Cananea.
   The mine, founded by an American entrepreneur in 1899, produces
about 160 tons of copper a year. About 40 percent was exported.
   Cananea had tried to improve efficiency and modernize in recent
years but a decline in the worldwide price of copper hurt its
earnings.

   A small earthquake struck northern Utah on
Sunday, rattling workers at the Morton Thiokol Corp. plant near
here. No damage was reported.
   The quake, recorded at 3.2 on the Richter scale, struck at 3:23
p.m. and apparently was an aftershock of a magnitude 4.5 quake that
occurred in the same area July 3, said Walter Arabasz of the
University of Utah seismograph stations.
   He said the epicenter ran along the western side of the Blue
Spring Hills, 13 miles west of Tremonton, and was felt by workers at
Thiokol. The aerospace company manufactures components for the space
shuttle.
   A magnitude 3.5 quake on the Richter scale of ground motion can
cause slight damage; a magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage.
   Arabasz said there were no reports of damage.
   ``If it it did anything unusual it would be right in the
epicenter area and it would be very minor,'' he said. The Thiokol
plant covers a fair portion of the epicenter, he said.

   A Florida couple said their pleasure boat
was sunk by whales off Costa Rica and they survived 66 days at sea
by eating raw fish and drinking purified water, the U.S. Coast Guard
reported Sunday.
   William Butler, 60, and Simone Butler, 52, of Miami, were ``weak
but recovering'' at a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being
rescued by a Costa Rican Coast Guard ship Saturday afternoon, said
U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Egbert Vallecillo.
   The survivors told authorities they lost about 50 pounds each
from the ordeal, said Vallecillo, who spoke to the couple by
telephone early Sunday. The U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific Command is
headquartered in Alameda, 10 miles east of San Francisco.
   William Butler told Coast Guard officials their 40-foot pleasure
boat Sibonay was attacked and sunk by ``several'' whales on June 15
about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
   ``They were large, according to Mr. Butler,'' Vallecillo said.
``But he didn't know how many whales.''
   The couple's last radio contact was June 13, when they talked to
their daughter in Miami, the Coast Guard spokesman said.
   Vallecillo said he'd heard of boats running into marine mammals
when there's poor visibility, but isn't sure if there are any
recorded cases of whale aggression.
   ``This happened in the early morning hours'' with good
visibility, he said. ``This is the first (case) I've documented.''
   As the boat was sinking, the couple said, they grabbed fishing
rods and a salt-water purifier and and got into a rubber lifeboat,
where they remained for the next two months, Vallecillo said.
   As the lifeboat drifted slowly eastward over two months, the
Butlers said, they caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and
survived multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft
repair kit.
   Butler told U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times the
couple spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down.
   On Saturday, a Coast Guard ship making its ``fisheries'' patrol
about 30 miles off the coast of Golfito spotted the raft and rescued
the couple.
   They were sailing from Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to
Honolulu, where they planned to vacation, Vallecillo said. Butler is
an experienced sailor, he said.
   Their daughter, Sally Smith, and son, Bill Butler, were flying to
Costa Rica on Sunday evening to be reunited with their parents,
Vallecillo said.

<HEAD>Clerics Want Northern Ireland to Forget Anniversaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anniversaries of past bloodshed
have prompted a Roman Catholic bishop and an Anglican bishop to call
on both religious communities to stop celebrating old wounds.
   The Roman Catholic bishop of Down and Connor, the Right Rev.
Cahal Daly, and the Anglican bishop of Connor, the Right Rev. Samuel
Poyntz, both said dwelling on the past only prolongs friction
between Protestants and Catholics.
   A week ago, Protestants converged on Londonderry to mark the
300th anniversary of a victory over the forces of the Catholic King
James II.
   Supporters of the mainly Catholic IRA marched in Belfast and in
Londonderry to mark the 20th anniversary of the deployment of
British troops and the 18th anniversary of the long-discarded
British policy of detaining terrorist suspects without trial.
   ``If we continue to dwell on the past, there can only be a
continuation of the misery-go-round,'' said Poyntz, who called last
week for both sides to agree to a date for calling off the
anniversary celebrations.
   ``Is it possible for us to leave the commemoration of past events
behind, at least until the situation has cooled down, and instead to
emphasize the opportunities of the present and the future?'' Poyntz
said.
   ``It is time to move on from this continual reliving of the past.
It is time to move forward,'' Daly said, following a visit with the
parents of a 15-year-old boy killed by a plastic bullet during a
disturbance.
   The anniversaries ``are looked forward to with apprehension and
fear by local communities that are held to ransom,'' the Catholic
bishop said.
   It was the Protestant march in Londonderry 20 years ago that
provoked violence that led to the troops being called in.
   At the march in Londonderry organized by Sinn Fein, the legal
wing of the IRA, the wing's publicity director Danny Morrison
scoffed at the bishops' appeal.
   ``I don't mean to offend anybody at all, but bishops saying
they're against commemorations?'' Morrison said. ``Is there anybody
commemorates things more often than bishops? What's going to go
next, Christmas?''
   Protestant marches celebrate past triumphs and wave the British
Union Jack. Republican parades honor the martyrs of the cause of a
united Ireland free of Britain, and proceed under the orange, white
and green flag of Ireland.
   These celebrations recall what the English writer William
Makepeace Thackeray observed in the 19th century: ``To have an
opinion about Ireland, one must begin by getting at the truth, and
where is it to be had in the country? Or rather, there are two
truths, the Catholic truth and the Protestant truth. Belief is made
a party business.''
   Aug. 12 holds an importance on the Protestant calendar second
only to July 12, celebrated as the victory of the Protestant William
of Orange over James II. The 300th anniversary is next year; in
1991, it's 300 years since William whipped James again at the battle
of Aughrim.
   Nelson McCausland, a Protestant member of the Belfast city
council, said the loyalist celebrations commemorated the defense of
civil and religious liberty.
   ``By contrast, the republican demonstrations are organized by
those whose business is murder and destruction,'' McCausland said.
   Paul Arthur, a lecturer at the University of Ulster, wrote in The
Irish Times of Dublin that ``it is difficult to exaggerate the
damage done to the political process by these `celebrations'.''
   ``They are not cathartic, but serve to live on another man's
wounds.'' Arthur recalled the words of a poem written in the context
of one of Northern Ireland's many republican campaigns: ``These are
the martyrs @ Who die for a future buried in the
past.'''

   Film producer Toby Halicki was killed while
shooting a car-crash movie Sunday evening when a water tower he was
planning to topple fell prematurely, police said.
   Halicki died when a cable attached to the tower snapped and
severed a telephone pole, which fell on him shortly before 6 p.m.,
Police Officer Michael Thorp said in nearby Tonawanda. No one else
was hurt.
   Halicki had been forced to buy $8 million in insurance to make
the movie after a local official accused him of lax safety planning.
   But in an interview with The Associated Press hours before his
death, Halicki said a close call while performing a stunt in another
movie had made him more cautious. ``You can always have chase
sequences where things go wrong,'' he said. ``You have to be
careful.''
   The 48-year-old Gardena, Calif., man, whose given name was Henry
Halicki but who was known as Toby, was dead on arrival at Kenmore
Mercy Hospital at 6:35 p.m., said hospital spokeswoman Annamae
Fetzer.
   Halicki was wrapping up local shooting on ``Gone in 60 Seconds
II,'' a sequel to his 1974 movie, which became a cult hit among fans
of car-crash movies and in which Halicki appeared. He also produced
the 1982 film ``Junk Man.''
   Sunday's shooting had called for the 100-foot-tall water tower in
an abandoned industrial park on the border between Buffalo and
Tonawanda to be brought down.
   In the scene, a tractor-trailer was to ram through a series of
parked cars before colliding into the tower standard, which had been
cut with a torch in two places earlier in the day to aid in the
tower's collapse.
   The tower was to be pulled down by trucks pulling cables, while
another cable attached to the axle of the tractor-trailer pulled the
tower through the base of the support.
   But the piece of support between the two cuts, which measured
about 10 feet, came free during one of the earlier shots, leaving
the tower standing on three legs.
   Workers had just made cuts through another of the legs, according
to witnesses, when the tower began to creak. Workers scrambled out
of the way, but Halicki didn't make it, witnesses said.
   In the original ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' Halicki played a car
thief, but it was the numerous crashes and chases that caught
audiences' attention. The title refers to the time it takes to steal
a car.
   In the interview Sunday, Halicki said he no longer did many of
the stunts called for in his movies.
   ``I still do some of them, but I don't do any of the hard ones,''
he said. ``I still enjoy getting in the car and racing it out or
doing the crashes in it, but I've limited it down.
   ``I've had some very close calls,'' he said. ``I had a head-on
collision with an airplane on my last film. We hit at a combined
speed of over 200 mph and we crashed the plane and put about 80
stitches in my head. I was very lucky.''
   When Halicki sought permission to shoot the film in the
industrial park, Tonawanda Town Supervisor Ronald Moline accused him
of ``flying by the seat of his pants.''
   Halicki, who said Sunday there was a lot of safety and planning
involved in his movies, was granted permission after obtaining the
insurance.

   A former New Jersey state trooper severely
injured in the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in Sioux City,
Iowa, last month has died, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Harlon ``Gerry'' Dobson, of Pittsgrove Township, N.J., died
Saturday at Crozier Chester Medical Center in this Philadelphia
suburb, where he was transferred after the crash. He was 44.
   His death brings the toll in the July 19 crash at Sioux City,
Iowa, to 112. There are 184 survivors.
   Molly Timlin, a hospital spokeswoman, said Dobson was transferred
to the Pennsylvania hospital on July 23 from St. Luke's Medical
Center in Sioux City.
   Dobson, who had retired from the state police force; his wife,
Joanne; state police detective Sgt. William Prato of Vineland; and
his wife, Rosemarie, were returning from a vacation on the
Denver-to-Chicago flight. His three traveling companions perished in
the crash.
   The DC-10 suffered a complete hydraulic failure after the tail
engine blew apart and damaged the hydraulic lines. The pilot managed
to guide the crippled plane toward the Sioux City airport, but it
crashed during the emergency landing.

   A French doctor descended into an
Antarctic ice crevasse Sunday to rescue a stranded sled dog on the
25th day of a seven-month, six-man expedition across the frozen
continent.
   The dog named Spinner and two other dogs fell into the crevasse
while pulling a sled over a snow bridge, said Cathy DeMoll, a
spokeswoman for the St. Paul-based Trans-Antarctica International
Expedition.
   All three dogs were in harnesses attached to the sled, preventing
them from falling to their deaths, DeMoll said. But before they
could be pulled to safety, Spinner fell out of his harness, and
landed on a ledge 25 feet down.
   Dr. Jean-Louis Etienne ``went in and he roped Spinner into a
harness,'' DeMoll said. ``The team pulled the dog up and then they
pulled Jean-Louis up.''
   The team of international explorers ``felt pretty good about it
because it was a pretty good exercise in crevasse rescue,'' the
spokeswoman said.
   None of the dogs was hurt.
   The 4,000-mile expedition is the first unmechanized traverse of
Antarctica. Forty-two dogs are being used to pull supplies as the
team skis.
   In an interview via satellite Sunday with ABC-TV, expedition
leader Will Steger said team members were in good spirits. Soviet
researcher Victor Boyarsky, 37, has recovered from a fall he took
Aug. 10 into a deep crevasse, Steger said.
   ``Everyone is getting along great,'' he said.
   The team has traveled about 250 miles since pushing off from King
George Island on July 27, DeMoll said. The expedition is scheduled
to end in March.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Sunday accused
sectarian fighters in Lebanon of trying to wreck the city of Beirut
and pleaded for a cease-fire.
   It was his second call in five days for an end to the bloodshed.
It came as the Vatican was exploring the possibility of a papal
peace mission to Lebanon, which is wracked by 14 years of civil war.
   ``In the name of God, I renew my urgent call to all responsible
authorities for harmony and an immediate cease-fire, so that a
dialogue can begin leading to an accord in which the legitimate
historical and religious rights of all parties are taken into
account,'' the pontiff said at the end of a Mass midway through his
three-day visit to Spain.
   The pope did not criticize any groups by name, but he appeared to
refer to Syrian soldiers and allied Moslem militias when he said:
``It seems that the intention is to destroy the city of Beirut, and
in particular, the zones inhabited by Christians.''
   More than 750 people have been killed since fighting broke out
between the Syrian-led fighters and Christian troops in March. Only
about 150,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million people have remained in the
city.
   Vatican officials were trying to contact Lebanese leaders to
press John Paul's peace effort, but there were no announcements
Sunday about the pope's earlier offer to visit Lebanon.
   ``He's trying to do everything he can,'' said papal spokesman
Joaquin Navarro. However, he said the Vatican did not envision
playing an official negotiating role in Lebanon.
   The Polish pontiff issued his cease-fire call at the end of a
Mass wrapping up the Vatican-sponsored 4th World Youth Day
celebrations in the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela.
   Thousands of the estimated 400,000 participants from 55 countries
signed an appeal for peace in Lebanon. It was to be sent to the
United Nations.
   Later Sunday, the pope visited a cathedral in the northern mining
center of Oviedo and spoke at a Mass at a field outside the city.
   He told a crowd of about 100,000 people it was necessary to
create ``new forms of solidarity and organization of work'' to
ensure that workers of all economic levels are respected.
   Echoing a central theme of his papacy, John Paul called the
Marxist model of collective labor a failure but also criticized
capitalist societies saying they fostered materialism and inequality.
   The pontiff's Oviedo stop and a scheduled trip Monday to the
mountain shrine of Covadonga were aimed at Spanish Catholics, while
the earlier part of the trip was geared to youth worldwide. The pope
is to return to Rome Monday.
   The World Youth Day celebrations were highlighted by a rally
Saturday night at Santiago de Compostela's Gozo Mountain. Tens of
thousands of youths spent the night in sleeping bags on the dusty
hill to ensure a place for the papal Mass there Sunday morning.
   In his homily to the young people, John Paul called for a
Christian ``radicalism'' to aid youth who are unemployed, hungry,
addicted to drugs or ``slaves of the eroticism spread everywhere.''
   The youths who packed Santiago de Compostela included a group of
Lebanese who waved their country's red, white and green flag.
   After singling out the group, John Paul said in Spanish: ``I
lament strongly that, despite the efforts of this past week, also on
the part of the Security Council of the United Nations, the
bombardments continue to create victims and suffering among the most
beloved people of Lebanon.''
   The 69-year-old pontiff's trip is his third to Spain and the 43rd
foreign voyage of his 11-year papacy.

   Clashes in Angola's 14-year-old civil war
have intensified, a newspaper reported Sunday. State television said
the government recalled its representatives from peace talks with
Angolan rebels in Zaire.
   The daily Jornal de Angola reported the first major military
incident in months involving Cuban troops, who are withdrawing from
Angola under an international peace accord signed last year in New
York.
   According to the paper, six Cuban soldiers died Aug. 14 during a
rebel attack near the village of Ganda, in central Benguela province.
   The rebels' Black Cockerel radio, monitored in Luanda Sunday,
said 150 people died and many were injured last week, when
government forces attacked the southern town of Mavinga, with
Soviet-built MiG 23 fighter jets and long-range artillery.
   The government has not officially confirmed any major military
operations. In Lisbon, Portugal, officials of the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola said government troops
launched a major three-pronged attack in the southeastern provinces
of Cuando-Cubango, Moxico and Cunene.
   State TPA television reported that armed forces chief Antonio dos
Santos Franca and a 12-man delegation returned Friday to Luanda from
Zaire after waiting for a rebel delegation.
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi
sealed a short-lived truce with a handshake on Jun. 22 at a summit
of African leaders in Gbadolite, Zaire.
   The cease-fire lasted one week and both sides' accusations of
truce violations have intensified in recent weeks. Sporadic talks
have continued in Zaire.
   The Western-backed rebels have been fighting the Marxist
government and its estimated 50,000 Cuban allies to force a
power-sharing agreement since 1975, when Angola gained independence
from Portugal.
   The rebels were not party to the U.S.-sponsored New York accords,
which paved the way for a Cuban pullout and Namibian independence
from South Africa.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Utah woman was arrested at the
international airport Sunday after authorities found 70 handguns in
six containers she brought with her on a flight from San Francisco,
an official said.
   Dominique Adams said she was promised a job in the Philippines if
she took the containers to Manila, air force Capt. Francisco Tayer
said.
   The weapons consisted of .45-caliber, .38-caliber, and
.25-caliber pistols packed in six containers whose markings
identified the contents as auto parts, Tayer said.
   Ms. Adams, 22, of Salt Lake City, told investigators a man
identified as Carlos Padilla gave the boxes to her in San Francisco,
where she boarded the Philippine Airlines flight to Manila, Tayer
said. Padilla's nationality was not known, Tayer said.
   Ms. Adams told reporters she was introduced to Padilla by a
friend, Jill Hasson of Provo, Utah. Ms. Adams said she had left her
3-year-old daughter in Padilla's hands and that she was worried for
her child's safety, Tayer said.
   Her brother, Joseph Adams of Spanish Fork, Utah, said he learned
of his sister's detention from broadcast reports Sunday. He said he
last saw his sister when she dropped by last week to say she was
leaving for California to train for a new job.
   ``She came in for five minutes to my brother's shop and said she
had gotten a new job that day,'' he said. ``She seemed very excited
about it and that's all I know. She didn't say what company, or if
she did I didn't pay much attention.''
   He said that he understood that his niece was left with her
roommate in Salt Lake City.
   ``The last I heard from my mother is that she was left with a
girlfriend named Jill who was apparently involved with this
company,'' Joseph Adams said, adding that he had no reason to
believe the youngster had been taken to Manila.

<HEAD>U.S. and Vietnam End Search for Americans Missing in Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Vietnam have ended
a joint search to try to resolve the fate of about 1,700 Americans
still listed as missing in action in Vietnam from the Vietnam war,
according to a report Sunday.
   Radio Hanoi said the search, conducted by U.S. and Vietnamese
specialists in three central provinces, began July 31 and ended
Saturday.
   The search was the seventh and last under a program to obtain
information on 70 ``priority cases'' in accordance with an agreement
reached by the two countries in August 1987, the broadcast said.
   It said the teams operated in the provinces of Quang Binh, Quang
Tri and Thua Thien-Hue.
   The Saturday broadast was monitored and made available by a
Western Embassy Sunday.
   Radio Hanoi's report said, ``The U.S. side highly valued the
effective cooperation given by Vietnam, especially the
administrations and people in localities where these joint teams had
come to perform their work.''
   It did not mention any results of the search or say if further
joint efforts were planned.
   Vietnam has increased its searches for American MIAs since the
1987 agreement and has turned over the remains of 212 bodies
possibly of U.S. servicemen.
   At the time of the 10th delivery of remains on June 21, the U.S.
State Department said 2,353 Americans were listed as missing in
action in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and China, with 1,719 in Vietnam.
   A breakthrough on the issue came when Gen. John Vessey, a special
representative of then President Ronald Reagan, met with Vietnamese
Foreign MInister Nguyen Co Thach in Hanoi in the summer of 1987 and
agreed to the program of joint searches.
   America and Vietnam do not have diplomatic relations.
   Some private American groups claim Vietnam is still holding live
Americans as prisoners. Vietnam has repeatedly denied the allegation.

   A passenger ferry crossing the Gulf of
California caught fire 26 miles from port Sunday and began sinking,
but all 355 people on board were rescued, officials said.
   There were 299 passengers and 56 crew on board the Mazatlan when
an engine overheated and exploded, Antonio Rosado Echanove, director
of the national ferry service, told the government news agency
Notimex.
   The ferry was on a 130-mile crossing from La Paz in Baja
California Sur to Topolobampo on the Mexican mainland, Rosado
Echanove said.
   He said the passengers and crew escaped the burning ferry on life
rafts and were picked up by another passenger vessel.
   Survivors interviewed by Notimex in Topolobampo said panic broke
out on board as passengers saw the smoke and flames and began
rushing for the life rafts.
   ``We couldn't breathe, we were almost asphyxiated by the smoke,''
passenger Fermin Camacho Lopez was quoted as saying.
   Firefighting boats from the Mexican navy and the government
petroleum monopoly Pemex tried to put out the blaze. Rosado Echanove
said it appeared the ferry would sink.
   He said there were 33 vehicles on board.
   ``Everything has been lost, including the luggage of the
passengers,'' he told Notimex.

   A sacred pole topped with a human scalp and
said to have the power of life and unity was presented to the Omaha
Tribe on Sunday after being held 101 years in a Boston museum.
   The pole, believed to more than 300 years old, is a symbol of
unity for the American Indian tribe. Its last keeper, Yellow Smoke,
entrusted it to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University because he
doubted younger generations of Omahas would cherish it.
   Tribal officials who recently negotiated its return welcomed it
back Sunday during the tribe's 185th annual powwow at its
northeastern Nebraska reservation.
   ``Although the pole was away from you physically, the spirit of
the sacred pole never left you,'' said Robin Ridington, a professor
of anthropology who has studied the pole.
   About 1,000 people _ dressed in ceremonial headdresses and beaded
leather vests as well as Batman T-shirts, dress shirts and blue
jeans _ looked on as the pole was blessed with cedar smoke and an
eagle feather.
   Tribal Chairman Doran Morris carried the pole, which is more than
5 feet long and 4 inches thick and consists mostly of pine, around a
circle of white bleachers in a meadow. Dancers followed as drums and
chanting filled the air.
   About 6,000 people attended the four-day powwow, which ended
Sunday, said tribal historian Dennis Hastings. About 1,600 of the
2,700 Omaha live on the reservation, Hastings said.
   The pole is believed to have been cut in northern Nebraska in the
1600s or 1700s.
   At its top is a human scalp. Animal skin webbing wrapped around
the middle of the pole contains feathers and down from cranes. A
stake made from ash is at the bottom.
   The Omaha, who were buffalo hunters, had a priest, or Keeper,
carry the pole from camp to camp. He was selected from one of the
tribe's two ancient units, the Sky People or the Earth People.
   The annual renewal ceremony was held with the pole at its center
to unify the tribe.
   The renewal ceremony included exchanges of reeds, poles and
buffalo meat. Songs and images combined to remind people that the
pole stood for both a person of the tribe and the tribe as a whole.
   When the buffalo were wiped out, the Omaha settled on their
reservation and abandoned the ceremony.
   A 1911 report by government ethnologists recounts the legend of
the pole: The son of an Omaha chief was hunting alone in the forest
when elders were in council to devise ways of keeping the tribe
together.
   He came upon a tree that was luminous but remained unconsumed by
its own light, the legend says. The tree was cut down, trimmed,
adorned with a scalp and called a human being.
   When the tribe gathered, the chiefs stood up and said, ``You now
see before you a mystery. Whenever we meet with troubles we shall
bring our troubles to him (the pole). We shall make offerings and
requests. All our prayers must be accompanied by gifts.''

   Americans infected with AIDS may need $2
billion to $5 billion annually to pay for the anti-viral drug AZT
that delays progression of the deadly disease, federal health
officials estimate.
   The Department of Health and Human Services last week expanded by
400,000 the number of AIDS patients eligible for AZT treatment by
declaring its effectiveness among patients whose disease is at an
early stage with no symptoms.
   The drug was already available to an estimated 200,000 patients
with symptoms of AIDS. AZT costs about $8,000 annually for each
patient, according to National Institutes of Health estimates.

   In the private and mysterious world of
high-powered jewelry dealing, Arthur Groom stands out like a diamond
in the rough.
   Groom, 39, whose firm sold $12 million worth of diamonds and
other gems last year, frequently travels to jungles, cavernous mines
and other remote spots in Asia and Africa in a constant search for
the world's rarest rocks.
   Like the sailing merchants of centuries past, Groom will barter
and trade for many of his stones. He recently swapped a shipload of
cement for $1 million worth of diamond ``roughs'' from the African
nation of Sierra Leone.
   Groom seeks stones in dangerous, strife-ridden nations, such as
Burma, where he says he is only the third American since 1962 to
gain the rights to deal in rubies. Most recently, Groom closed a
deal to become the sole distributor of American soft drinks in that
Southeast Asian nation. He plans to repatriate the profits in gems.
   And while most diamond dealers prefer to keep their actions
cloaked in secrecy, Groom, who is outspoken and friendly, seeks the
spotlight. He employs a publicist who pitches Groom as a modern-day
Indiana Jones.
   ``There have been very few dealers who are so public,'' said Abe
Michael Shainberg, executive director of New York's exclusive
Diamond Dealers Club, considered the world's most important diamond
exchange. ``The average diamond dealer, for security reasons, does
not want such publicity.''
   He described Groom as ``an honest and honorable man. His
publicity is good for his business, and good for the rest of us,
too.''
   Seated in a small office at his fashionable store in the New York
suburb of Ridgewood, Groom proudly showed off stones with $100,000
price tags. The shirtsleeved man, who wore no jewelry, smiled and
insisted he is ``not Indiana Jones.''
   ``No intrigue,'' he said. ``But I do have a message.''
   Groom says American business can exert a positive influence
throughout the world. He is convinced the world respects the
American system, but Americans must also understand and respect
other cultures.
   ``In many cultures, the American way does not hold up,'' he said.
``How dare we have that attitude that ours is the only way.''
   Groom's story, however, is the stuff of the American dream. He
left a successful job as a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 15
years ago after a friend's father urged him to take a gem course
that left him ``absolutely fascinated'' with precious stones.
   Groom said he struggled at first, working 15-hour days in a
one-room enterprise as his friends climbed their respective
corporate ladders. Arthur Groom &amp; Co. in Ridgewood and his American
Trading Co. in New York slowly grew into a
multimillion-dollar-a-year business with offices around the globe.
   Unlike some dealers who only work the phones, Groom goes directly
to far-away mines to pick out his own stones and diamond roughs. One
of the few dealers who sells both diamonds and other gems, Groom is
the consumate frequent flyer, logging more than 150,000 miles each
year.
   Groom said he draws energy from his work.
   ``There's a science to picking stones in the jungle,'' he said.
``Then you go to the Diamond Dealers Club and pull up your
shirtsleeves and wheel and deal. Some Saturdays, I'll simply work
the floor of this stoor, helping an old lady who needs a $10
soldering job on a broken chain.''
   His ruby deal with Burma brought Groom face-to-face with military
leaders of a nation that was virtually shut off to American
businessmen since its 1962 coup. The Burmese rubies, Groom said, are
the rarest and most desirable stones in the world, retailing for
about $10,000 a carat.
   When asked if dealing with Burma's harsh government tugged at his
conscience, Groom nodded yes.
   ``But I'll be putting 1,200 people to work in the soft drink
bottling plant. I really believe we should be there to have a
presence.''
   Groom said he was moved by the poverty in many African nations.
He said he believes trading cement, food and clothing for gems will
make a difference there.
   ``It's easy to pay cash,'' Groom said. ``But what good does it do
for those countries? Who gets the money? These people need so much.''

   The U.S. subsidiary of Toshiba Corp. will produce
color television picture tubes in the United States larger than any
other tubes made in America, the company announced.
   Toshiba Display Devices Inc. of Horsehead, N.Y., is to begin
producing 32- and 34-inch ``super-large'' picture tubes for color
television sets beginning Monday, said Toshiba Spokesman Soichi
Matsuzawa.
   TDD is the first company in the United States to produce picture
tubes larger than 30 inches, Matsuzawa said Saturday.
   The company will produce 20,000 of the two kinds of tubes a month
until the end of this year, then increase monthly production next
year to 30,000, Matsuzawa said.
   The company, which currently produces 20- and 21-inch picture
tubes, has invested $100 million to produce the ``super-large''
televisions and increased its work force from 750 to 1,200,
Matsuzawa said.
   TDD plans to ship the tubes to Toshiba's television manufacturing
plant in Lebanon, Tenn., as well as to other U.S.-based television
manufacturers, he said.

<HEAD>Burma Announces Joint Venture with Singapore Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma, which shunned foreign involvement in
its economy for more than a quarter of a century, has announced a
joint manufacturing venture with a private foreign company.
   The official Working People's Daily said Saturday the new
company, Myanmar (Burma) -Singapore International Limited, was
formed Aug. 18 and has an authorized capital of 50 million Burmese
kyats.
   The kyat trades officially at about 6.5 to the U.S. dollar but at
more than 40 to the dollar on the thriving black market.
   It is the first manufacturing joint venture announced between the
new Burmese government and a private foreign firm.
   The new trading company will manufacture and market construction
and electrical goods, stationery, and printing and photographic
goods, the newspaper said.
   Its 5,000 shares will be divided equally between the Singaporean
company SKS Marketing Ltd. and Burma's military government, the
newspaper said.
   Burma once was one of Southeast Asia's richest countries, but a
quarter of a century of restrictive socialist planning brought it to
the brink of economic collapse by last year.
   Burma was declared a least-developed country in 1987 by the
United Nations and its foreign debt stands at over $3 billion.
   The military government began a more open economic policy after
it crushed a nationwide uprising for democratic change last
September, killing hundreds.
   Some foreign governments including the United States and members
of the European Economic Community cut their financial assistance in
protest, but others, mainly Asian countries, have cooperated with
the new rulers.
   However, most trading agreements reached since the army takeover
have involved the extraction or purchase of Burma's natural
resources.
   Analysts say one of the main obstacles to the expansion of
Burma's international trade remains the artificially high value of
the kyat, which Rangoon has refused to devalue.

<HEAD>Japanese Electronics Giant JVC to Launch New Hollywood Film Company</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: EMBARGOED until 10:30 p.m. EDT. Time set by source.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent of Japanese electronics giant JVC
announced Sunday that it will invest more than $100 million in a new
motion-picture production company to be headed by a former president
of 20th Century Fox.
   Lawrence Gordon, the former Fox executive and producer of such
films as ``Field of Dreams,'' ``Die Hard,'' ``48Hrs.'' and the new
Sylvester Stallone movie ``Lock Up,'' will co-own and run the new
company, it was announced simultaneously in Los Angeles and Tokyo.
   The joint venture, to be called Largo Entertainment, represents
the first major move by a Japanese company in the production of
high-budget Hollywood movies.
   Largo will finance the development and production of movies that
will be distributed in the United States by one of the major
Hollywood studios.
   JVC is the U.S. arm of Victor Co. of Japan Ltd. Japan's
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd., which makes Panasonic and
Technics products, owns 50.8 percent of Victor.
   Victor will operate Largo through a new subsidiary, JVC
Entertainment Inc.
   Gordon said in an interview Sunday that Largo would open its
doors Monday morning at Gordon's small office on the Fox studio lot.
He said he would begin to fill staff positions this week and the
company's first movie should be in theaters by late 1990.
   ``I want to make films that will play throughout the world,''
Gordon said. ``Most things that play well here will play well
overseas.''
   Gordon refused to specify how much JVC's initial investment would
be, saying only that it will be ``well in excess of $100 million.''
He said JVC also will make additional capital infusions in coming
months.
   At peak operation, Largo plans to make five to eight movies a
year, with budgets mirroring those of the major studios, about $20
million a picture.
   ``If we wanted to make a movie like `Rain Man,' we could have
done it,'' Gordon said. Largo might supplement its release slate by
acquiring independently produced films, Gordon said.
   Gordon said that JVC approached him six months ago with the idea
of developing an entertainment production company that would
complement the company's vast production of VCRs and other
electronic hardware.
   Largo plans to expand ``into all areas of the entertainment
business'' at a later date, JVC said in a statement.
   ``They want software,'' Gordon said. ``And they want to learn the
business.'' Creative decisions at Largo, Gordon said, will be made
independently of JVC.
   Gordon, the producer of more than 25 movies, served as president
of 20th Century Fox from 1984 to 1986, where he oversaw such films
as ``Cocoon,'' ``Jewel of the Nile,'' ``Commando,'' ``Aliens'' and
``The Fly.''
   His latest movie, ``Lock Up,'' has been a box-office
disappointment, but ``Field of Dreams'' was a commercial and
critical hit. He produced the upcoming ``Family Business,'' with
Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick.
   ``We are pleased to be introduced to American film making through
the eyes and ears of Mr. Gordon,'' JVC Chairman Seiichiro Niwa said
in a statement. ``He is a man whose vision and experience are fully
compatible with our goals and needs.''
   JVC is perhaps best known in the United States for creating the
VHS videocassette format, now the industry standard. In addition to
manufacturing audio, video and television hardware, JVC also is a
leader in Japan's home video and record business.
   Among JVC's subsidiaries are CIC-Victor Video, which is the

   The U.S. dollar opened slightly lower against the
Japanese yen Monday, while stock prices rebounded.
   The dollar started trading at 143.13 yen, down 0.30 yen from
Friday's close of 143.52 yen. It closed at 142.60 yen in New York on
Friday.
   Currency dealers said there was no specific market-moving news
during early trading that would explain the dollar's low opening,
which followed its slip Friday in New York on profit-taking.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 26.97 points Friday, gained 47.59
points, or 0.13 percent, shortly after the market opened to move to
35,110.73.
