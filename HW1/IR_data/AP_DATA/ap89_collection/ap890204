   Bitingly cold arctic air and freezing drizzle iced highways
Friday from the Northwest to New England and south to Texas, closing
scores of schools and one state government and prompting increased
aid for the homeless.
   The urge to play in new-fallen snow resulted in four sledding
deaths in Washington. Twelve other deaths also were blamed on the
weather, including four of hypothermia.
   A Greyhound Trailways bus with 15 people aboard spun around and
overturned Friday on icy Interstate 70 in Colorado near the Utah
line. Police said six people suffered broken limbs and ribs.
Helicopters took the injured to hospitals.
   Temperatures early Friday were below zero all the way south to
the middle Mississippi Valley, with readings of 20 below zero to 38
below zero over the Dakotas, Wyoming, much of Montana, Minnesota and
northwestern Nebraska, the National Weather Service said. Austin,
Texas, fell from a high Thursday of 69 to a low Friday of 28, and a
freeze warning was posted for the lower Rio Grande Valley.
   Record lows were scattered from Oregon to Iowa, including 35
below zero at Great Falls, Mont. Mason City, Iowa, had a low of 20
below zero, but wind gusting to 31 mph produced a wind chill factor
of 78 below zero. Minong, Wis., hit 32 below zero.
   At noon, the temperature was only 27 degrees below zero at
Bozeman and Butte, Mont. The weather service's official low for the
Lower 48 states was 52 degrees below zero at Wisdom, Mont.
   But ahead of the cold air, 14 cities in the Southeast and East
reported record highs, ranging from 61 at Beckley, W.Va., to 84 at
Jacksonville, Fla.
   The cold reached all the way to New Orleans on Friday, less than
five days before Mardi Gras. ``Snow, sleet, ice, or 80 mile an hour
winds. Those are the only things that would stop a parade,'' said
Assistant Police Chief Ray Holman.
   In Montana, the first state struck by the frigid air that had
previously stunned Alaska and slid over Canada, moderation of
temperatures isn't expected until Monday or Tuesday, and then it
could warm only to about zero, said weather service spokesman Robert
Doherty.
   The mass of cold air remained over the eastern two-thirds of
Alaska, but temperatures continued to moderate. Northway was the
coldest at 50 below, Fairbanks warmed up to minus 8 and Anchorage
reached 10 above. A low pressure system moving in from the west
warmed the western third of Alaska; above the Arctic Circle, Barrow
reached 16 above and it was 20 above at Prudhoe Bay.
   Montana's state government reopened Friday after shutting down
the day before because of the cold and wind, but Wyoming Gov. Mike
Sullivan closed his government because of the cold and more than a
foot of snow. Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton gave state workers more
time to get to work because of icy roads.
   An estimated 200 travelers had been stranded since Wednesday at
Dubois, Idaho, and roads out of the area remained closed by snow
Friday, among a number of highways closed in the state.
   In southern Maine, Interstate 95 was closed from Brunswick to
Freeport for 1{ hours after a 15-car pileup. No injuries were
reported.
   Slippery roads and the cold forced school closings in Arkansas,
Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada,
New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Washington state
and Wyoming. Some colleges and universities also closed.
   Officials at Oregon State University in Corvallis canceled
classes for the fourth time in the school's 120-year history.
   The four sledding deaths in Washington were unrelated. Three of
the four, including a 6-year-old boy and a 12-year-old, occured in
the Seattle area; the fourth was in Tacoma.
   Of the 12 other deaths since the start of the cold wave, seven
were traffic fatalities: four in Oklahoma, one in Oregon, one in
Idaho and one in Indiana. A utility worker was killed in Washington
while repairing a downed power line. And four people died of
exposure, one in Martin, S.D., one in Great Falls, Mont., one in
Lame Deer, Mont., and one in Sioux City, Iowa.
   Two school buses collided on an icy parking lot in Indianapolis,
and 17 elementary school students suffered minor injuries, officials
said.
   Many cities stepped up aid to the homeless.
   Shelters in Denver agreed to remain open during the day, rather
than putting their clients out on the street until nightfall, said
Christine Hager, Denver's coordinator for the homeless. The city
also contracted with hotels to house homeless people, Hager said.
   Some homeless shelters in Oregon reported operating beyond normal
capacity. In Minneapolis, as many as 400 people slept outside
Thursday night, including 150 in campsites, said Mary Jo Copeland,
director of Sharing and Caring, a day shelter for the poor. Four
homeless people have been treated for frostbite.
   Seattle Mayor Charles Royer asked residents to donate blankets,
warm clothing, toiletries and non-perishable food for the city's
homeless.
   At Paducah, Texas, hundreds of people were left without heat when
a 4-inch natural gas pipeline ruptured. Temperatures were in the
single digits at Paducah and residents were told to move to
electrically heated buildings.
   Helena, Mont., also had to cope with Thursday's train explosion
that forced the daylong evacuation of thousands of people and left
some without power. On Friday, officials asked residents to cut back
on use of such things as space heaters and stoves to conserve
electricity.
   Mail delivery was curtailed at Mitchell, S.D., after two postal
workers suffered mild frostbite in wind chill factors as low as 65
below zero, said Postmaster Ron Kight.
   In the Sierra Nevada of northern California, a 70-mile stretch of
Interstate 80 from Applegate to Truckee was closed by zero
visibility and high wind, but reopened late Friday afternoon to
small cars only, with travelers convoyed in groups of 100 vehicles.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Salvador Laurel said
Saturday that doctors fear Ferdinand Marcos has lost the will to
live, has only a 10 percent chance of surviving the year, and wants
to die in his own country.
   Laurel spoke to reporters after returning from Honolulu, where
the ousted Philippine president, accused of plundering billions from
his homeland, is in exile.
   He said he would seek a meeting immediately with President
Corazon Aquino to relay Marcos' wish and appeal ``to her sense of
Christian values'' to allow the former president to come home to die.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos or members of his family
to return from Hawaii, where they have lived since a popular
uprising toppled his 20-year administration in February 1986.
   Laurel said doctors in Honolulu told him that Marcos might not
survive the trip to the Philippines but that the former president
would prefer to die on the plane rather than on foreign soil.
   A newspaper in the Philippines quoted a Cabinet official as
saying Saturday that the government has decided not to allow Marcos
to return and would even bar his body from being sent back after he
dies.
   The Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted Cabinet Secretary Jose de
Jesus as saying the government feared Marcos' supporters would try
to destabilize the Aquino administration if their leader came home.
   ``We can't risk the gains by any destabilization effort which
could derail us,'' de Jesus was quoted as saying.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified government sources as saying
the Cabinet considered allowing Marcos to return to Laoag, capital
of his home province of Ilocos Norte about 250 miles north of
Manila.But the idea was rejected because of fears Marcos would not
honor the restriction, the paper said.
   Laurel visited Marcos' hospital bedside Thursday without Mrs.
Aquino's blessing.
   Marcos, 71, remained in critical condition Friday in St. Francis
Medical Center's intensive care unit, but an attorney said Marcos
was buoyed by Laurel's visit and doctors said his fever had subsided.
   Laurel declined to disclose details of his conversations with
Marcos, his doctors and his wife, Imelda.
   ``Whatever our past differences and conflicts, the reality is
that the crisis in this man's life can seriously affect political
stability of the Philippines. Now is the time for compassion and
forgiveness in order to achieve much needed unity among all
Filipinos,'' Laurel said in a statement Thursday night.
   Marcos and his wife are under U.S. indictment for allegedly
plundering the Philippines of more than $100 million and stashing
much of the money in the United States.
   When Laurel was asked whether Marcos would ever return to his
homeland, he replied:``That's up to her,'' referring to Mrs. Aquino.
   Marcos' son, Ferdinand Jr., said he relayed a letter to Mrs.
Aquino asking that his father be allowed to return. Mrs. Aquino, who
has repeatedly refused to allow Marcos to return, said she had not
received the letter.
   ``I can just make a decision once I know what the letter is all
about,'' she told The Associated Press in Manila.
   Laurel conceded his was a personal, not official, visit, but said
he would make a full report to Mrs. Aquino.
   Marcos was breathing with the assistance of a respirator
following emergency surgery Wednesday to reduce fluids building up
in his lungs. Hospital spokeswoman Norma Kop said Marcos was alert
but unable to talk because of the respirator.
   Marcos was admitted to the hospital Jan. 15 for treatment of
pneumonia and bronchial asthma. In December, he was hospitalized
twice with congestive heart failure.
   The Marcoses would need permission from the U.S. attorney general
and the U.S. District Court in New York to leave the United States,
according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella, the prosecutor
in the U.S. government's racketeering case against Marcos and his
wife.
   A federal judge in New York is to decide this month whether
Marcos is healthy enough to stand trial on criminal racketeering
charges. Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent and is free on $5 million bail.

<HEAD>First Lady Supports Ban on Assault Weapons</HEAD>

   Barbara Bush says she fears guns and, despite
the president's membership in the National Rifle Association, favors
banning the rapid-fire assault weapons used in a wave of gang
killings and the California rampage that left five children dead and
29 others wounded.
   The first lady, in an interview Friday, also expressed ``enormous
sympathy'' for the financial plight of members of Congress, who are
taking political heat for a 51 percent pay increase.
   ``I know it sounds outrageous to people at home, but if they saw
the cost of Washington housing ... . It's terrible. And the
sacrifices the family makes,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   She said her family had not been able to live off her husband's
salary in the 1960s when he was a member of the House from Houston,
but had to rely on the money he had earned as an oilman. She said
they probably could have made it on his congressional salary if they
hadn't owned two homes and hadn't wanted to send their children to
private schools.
   Mrs. Bush said she did not want to discuss the ``politics and
policies'' surrounding handgun ownership. Her husband, President
Bush, opposes new federal handgun controls and is a lifetime member
of the NRA. The NRA is the most powerful lobby against laws
regulating firearms.
   ``I myself do not own a gun,'' she said. ``I choose not to get
into that. I'm afraid of guns. ... I'm so afraid I'd shoot the wrong
person.''
   Nancy Reagan, before moving to Washington eight years ago,
revealed she had owned ``a tiny little gun'' that she kept by her
bed for protection while her husband was away. In her first White
House interview in 1981, Mrs. Reagan said she had gotten rid of the
weapon.
   Marking the end of her second week in the White House, Mrs. Bush
spent part of Friday afternoon giving her first interviews since her
husband became president. ``I feel at home here,'' she said, sitting
on a couch, bathed in light from an arched window behind her.
   Asked if her husband had changed in any way since becoming
president, she replied, ``I don't see a difference with him.''
Pointing to several people in the room, she said, ``I see a
difference in you and you and you. Not me. I mean it's just
different when you're president. Everybody treats you differently
when you're president.''
   Joking about her husband's former status as vice president, Mrs.
Bush said, ``I spend half my life saying, `Could you please get the
vice president on the phone?' and the operator says, `Do you really
want Dan Quayle' or `Don't you know Dan Quayle's in Venezuela.'''
   More seriously, she said, one big difference for Bush is that
``everything you say becomes major, and it is major. He is the
president of the United States.''
   And yet, she said of her husband: ``I think he's exactly the
same.'' She said many people who used to kid with her husband had
stopped doing that briefly but ``after awhile they all became normal
again. It just took a little while. ...
   ``I call him Mr. President sometimes _ when I'm needling him ...
to tease him, `Yes, Mr. President.'''
   The first lady was asked whether she favored enactment of laws
banning sale to the public of military assault guns. Measures to
outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety of rifles
are pending in Congress and dozens of states. It was a Chinese AK-47
assault rifle that a gunman used in the rampage in which five
children were killed and 29 others, were wounded in Stockton, Calif.
last month.
   Mrs. Bush said she thought such weapons already were outlawed.
``They should be, absolutely,'' she said.
   While refusing to discuss her position on handguns, Mrs. Bush
said that she does not like to go hunting, as does her husband, an
avid outdoorsman.
   ``I went hunting with George once,'' Mrs. Bush recalled. ``He
told me to follow the bird, and I followed the bird and his head
came right through that little circle (the rifle scope). I put down
the gun and said, `That's it. I'm not going to do that again.'''

   President Bush was using his Camp David
mountain hideaway today to work on a plan for solving the savings
and loan crisis that aides said was unlikely to embrace a
controversial deposit insurance fee.
   Bush was meeting at the Maryland compound with Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady, Budget Director Richard Darman and other key
advisers to go over the Treasury's recommendations for S&amp;Ls.
   White House aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
did not expect the president to reach a final decision on the
complete S&amp;L package, although a depositors' fee seems to have been
ruled out.
   Administration officials have refused to disavow the fee
publicly, but aides conceded privately that the plan most likely
would not include it.
   On Friday, Bush summoned congressional leaders to the White House
to hear their advice. Just as in a Thursday meeting with industry
officials, the president did not reveal his own preference from
among the options discussed.
   From the congressional leaders, participants said, Bush heard
overwhelmingly one-sided advice against a proposal to charge
depositors about 25 cents for every $100 in their accounts.
   ``I don't recall anybody taking the other side of that issue,''
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., the chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, told reporters afterward.
   Both he and Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, the committee's senior
Republican, predicted that the bailout package eventually agreed to
by Congress and the administration would include an increase in the
premium that institutions pay for federal insurance, but no new
direct fee on depositors.
   ``That deposit fee is not a live option,'' Garn said. ``I don't
think it was to begin with.''
   The fees or insurance premium increase would help raise the $7
billion to $9 billion needed to pay the interest on the $85 billion
to $100 billion in borrowing that the administration believes is
needed to bail out insolvent thrifts.
   The president told the legislators that he hopes to have the
administration's plan in place early next week. On Thursday, he
addresses a joint House-Senate session on the budget.
   At the meeting Friday, Bush told lawmakers: ``Whatever we come up
with will not be popular, and I expect that whatever you come up
with will not be popular. But we've got to get the problem solved.
   ``There are no easy answers, and no worrying about blame _ plenty
to go around.''
   Meanwhile, in another development, federal regulators late Friday
announced the resignation of Stuart D. Root, the executive director
of the fund that insures savings and loan deposits.
   Root, appointed to head the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp. in October 1987, submitted his resignation on Monday. It will
be effective Feb. 10.
   Replacing Root as acting director will be Mary A. Creedon,
currently principal deputy director of operations, said the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, the FSLIC's parent agency. She had previously
served as acting FSLIC director from December 1983 until March 1987.
   Root last year presided over the sales or closings of 205
insolvent institutions and the ``stabilization'' of 18 others at a
combined cost of $38 billion.

   The owner of the Just Sweats clothing chain,
his partner and a doctor were charged with murder Friday in an
alleged $1.5 million insurance scam involving the faked death of the
owner.
   Melvin Hanson, co-founder of the Columbus, Ohio-based athletic
clothing chain; his partner, John Barrett Hawkins; and Dr. Richard
Pryde Boggs of Glendale were charged in the murder of Ellis Henry
Greene, 32.
   Green's body was found in Boggs' office April 16 and was
misidentified as that of Hanson.
   Hanson, 47, who was arrested last week carrying Greene's driver's
license, is being held in a Columbus, Ohio, jail on grand theft
charges under a $5 million bond. Hawkins, 25, who collected $1
million in death benefits on Hanson, remains at large. Boggs, 56,
was arrested Friday and held without bail pending arraignment Monday.
   Hanson was believed dead until mid-1988, when police in
California discovered that a man identified as Hanson who died in
Boggs' office was not Hanson.
   The discovery and the fact that Hawkins had cashed $1 million in
life insurance checks prompted authorities to file federal warrants
for their arrest.
   Authorities allege that Hanson's death was faked to collect the
insurance money.
   The murder charges against all three men carry special
circumstances that make them eligible for the death penalty. The
special circumstances alleged are murder for financial gain and
aiding and abetting.
   Ten charges were filed against each man, including murder,
conspiracy to commit murder, insurance fraud, grand theft, and
assault with a stun gun.
   Boggs, 56, told police he believed the man found dead in his
office was Hanson. He said the man died after complaining of chest
pains. Hawkins had the body cremated the next day.
   Police later discovered that a thumbprint from the corpse did not
match the one on Hanson's California driver's license. The body,
which resembled Hanson, later was identified as Greene, a former
Ohioan who lived in California.
   Hanson and Hawkins also are accused of stealing about $2 million
from Just Sweats, which they founded in 1985. The company has filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy code.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez was sworn in as
president Friday after ousting President Alfredo Stroessner in a
coup that reportedly left scores dead. Rodriguez ordered the
dictator out of the country he had ruled for 34 years.
   Rodriguez, who had been Stroessner's second-in-command in the
army and whose daughter is married to Stroessner's son, took the
oath of office and swore in a nine-member Cabinet comprised of seven
civilians, an active general and a retired general.
   Paraguayans poured into the streets to celebrate the military
coup and to gape at damage left by hours of heavy fighting between
rebel soldiers and police and troops loyal to Stroessner.
   ``My government will respect the human rights of everyone to make
democracy a reality,'' Rodriguez, five rows of medals on his
shirtfront, said during a short speech at the 19th century National
Palace overlooking the broad Paraguay River.
   Cox newspapers, quoting from a classified State Department
report, said Friday that Rodriquez is considered by law enforcement
authorities in Paraguay to be the country's No. 1 drug trafficker.
   The New York Times on Saturday quoted John Hoyt Williams, a
professor of Latin American history at Indiana State University in
Terre Haute, Ind., as saying, ``Rodriguez has reportedly provided
protection, airfields and an air taxi service to people smuggling
drugs northward.''
   At least 18 soldiers and a handful of civilians were killed
during fierce clashes between troops loyal to Stroessner and
Rodriguez, the Roman Catholic Church-run Radio Caritas said, saying
that the total could top 200.
   It gave no source or explanation for the wide fluctuation.
Officials at the main military and police hospitals refused to give
figures on casualties, and the new government made no estimate.
   But a police sergeant said on condition of anonymity: ``I'm sad
for my 35 dead companions. About 150 soldiers died at the
presidential escort batallion, and two civilians.''
   Stroessner, 76, was put under house arrest at an army base, about
30 of his followers and aides detained, and the hierarchy of the
government and ruling Colorado Party replaced.
   Stroessner was ordered out of the country, and unconfirmed
reports said he was going to Santiago, Chile. But Gen. Mario
Mardones, Santiago police commander, said: ``He is definitely not
coming here tonight. He is still in Paraguay. That's official.''
   Mardones said he believed Stroessner was leaving Paraguay
Saturday morning, ``but we do not know where to. Not necessarily
Chile.''
   Rodriguez was cheered by several thousand citizens as he took the
oath of office and swore in a Cabinet. About 15,000 accompanied him
to the Colorado Party headquarters and cheered again when he
appointed Juan Ramon Chaves, 87, as party president, replacing
pro-Stroessner militant Sabino Montonaro.
   ``We're going to have a true democracy!'' shouted Domingo Laino,
president of the National Accord group of four opposition parties
and Paraguay's best-known human rights advocate.
   ``I think that the era of terrorism and corruption that affected
our country for so long has come to an end, thanks to the armed
forces,'' said Aldo Zuccolillo, publisher of ABC Color, the
country's biggest newspaper at the time Stroessner closed it down in
1984 for printing news the government didn't like.
   Rodriguez, however, said nothing about elections nor how long his
provisional presidency would last. He spoke at his swearing-in
ceremony and in a nationwide address hours earlier in which he
declared he was ``taking command of the country from this moment.''
   Rodriguez, 64, commands the First Army Corps, the premier unit of
the mostly-conscript, 12,500-man army. Diplomats and political
observers said his coup was provoked by Stroessner's attempt to
force him to retire, his personal dislike for Montonaro and the
growing influence of the military pro-Stroessner wing of the
Colorado Party.
   Rodriguez took advantage of what observers said was widespread
military resentment at the forced, and allegedly politically
motivated, retirements of about 130 army colonels and navy captains
last month.
   At about 9:45 p.m. Thursday night, shooting broke out at the
corps' base in Loma Pyta, four miles north of the capiital. Soon
after, 40 to 50 tanks rumbled out of the base heading downtown
toward the headquarters of the police and Stroessner's presidential
guard.
   ``They didn't even ask us to surrender,'' said a member of the
presidential guard, located next to the U.S. Embassy in a
fashionable neighborhood of streets lined by fine homes and old
mango trees. ``They just opened fire and battered down the gates
with small tanks.''
   Army units around the country rallied to Rodriguez' side, and the
lack of support for Stroessner was broadcast throughout the capital
by Radio Primero de Marzo, which the rebels took over.
   The two TV stations in the capital abruptly went off the air
after the shooting started, as did all radio stations except Radio
Caritas and Radio Primero de Marzo.
   As light dawned and Paraguayans ventured from their homes, they
saw the main building at the presidential guard roofless and with
gaping holes in its brick walls. The modern National Telephone
building behind the police station was a mess of twisted metal and
shattered glass.
   Pools of blood that dried quickly into large red stains were
beside bullet-riddled cars. In front of the presidential guard,
scene of some of the heaviest fighting, were the bodies of a dozen
soldiers who died defending Stroessner.
   The coup was as successful as it was sudden and unexpected. By
afternoon, Rodriguez was in complete control. There were no apparent
pockets of resistence to his authority, no condemnations by foreign
governments.
   Stroessner had been a staunch U.S. ally, but in 1986 the Reagan
administration labeled his government a dictatorship. He has been
reported in poor health since prostate surgery five months ago.

team was suspended for allegedly staging a photo session on school
grounds in which some of his players posed with a machine pistol, an
assault rifle and a bayonet, school officials said.
   Mike Pearson, a physical education teacher at Oxon Hill High
School in Prince George's County, Md. was placed on administrative
leave with pay on Monday after school officials learned that
defensive players on the school's football team posed, weapons in
hand, for the promotional poster on Jan. 27.
   A student told school officials that Pearson asked him to bring
the weapons to school, officials said Friday. The weapons were not
loaded when they were confiscated by school security officers and
turned over to police, school officials said.
   The student, who is enrolled at the school but is not a member of
the Oxon Hill football team, was temporarily suspended Monday,
school officials said.
   The players said the poster was intended to be used as a
publicity stunt to showcase the team's ``top guns'' and originally
was supposed to be staged at the county jail.
   That didn't work out, so they staged the photo session at the
school.
   ``It was a pretty innocent thing,'' one player, who asked not to
be identified, told The Washington Post. ``The idea was to make the
guys look tough, that's all.''
   The incident occurred one day after four students were shot at
another high school in nearby Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Three Mile Island Can Boil Away Water Left over From Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of the Three Mile Island nuclear
plant has been given clearance to boil away 2.3 million gallons of
radioactive water that is part of the legacy of the nation's worst
commercial nuclear accident.
   About 260,000 gallons of the water has been sitting in the
reactor building basement since the accident at the Pennsylvania
plant in 1979. The rest of the water was used in cleanup operations
since the accident.
   General Public Utilities Nuclear, the plant operator, proposed to
get rid of all the water by boiling it into steam released from a
100-foot-high stack, and packaging impurities for shipment to a
low-level radioactive waste dump.
   But two Pennsylvania citizens' groups challenged the decision,
expressing concern about the release of radiation into the
atmosphere. The groups asked the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board _
which is part of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission _ to consider
other alternatives, including storing the water in tanks for perhaps
30 years to allow radiation to decay.
   But after holding hearings in Lancaster, Pa., the licensing board
said in a written decision that the storage plan ``is not obviously
superior to the evaporation proposal.''
   ``We are convinced that implementation of (GPU Nuclear's)
proposal will have extremely small radiation exposure consequences,
both to workers and the general public,'' the board said.
   Last spring, GPU Nuclear raised eyebrows among local citizens by
spending initial $800,000 on the evaporation system even before the
licensing board had held hearings to decide whether the system could
be used.
   Kay Pickering, spokeswoman for Three Mile Island Alert, an
anti-nuclear group, said at the time that it was ``distressing''
that the plant operator had apparently acted prematurely.
   But GPU Nuclear said it was merely trying to plan ahead, and that
it would abide by whatever the board decided.
   The $7 million evaporation process is part of the $1 billion
cleanup of Three Mile Island Unit 2. During the accident, uranium
fuel was allowed to lose the vital cooling water the normally covers
it, causing material in the core to melt.

<HEAD>Trump Needs Only FAA Approval to Take Over Eastern Shuttle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump needs only a safety certification
from the Federal Aviation Administration to clear the way for his
takeover of Eastern Airlines' profitable Northeastern shuttle
service.
   The Transportation Department declared his organization
financially fit Friday, giving final approval of an economic
certification for the New York real estate magnate.
   The department had given tentative approval of the planned $365
million purchase two weeks ago and it became final after no
objections were raised by interested parties, said department
spokesman Hal Paris.
   ``As far as we're concerned, he can fly,'' said Paris. He said
the department determined that Trump had the managerial talent and
the financial resources to operate what is to be renamed the Trump
Shuttle.
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said there is no deadline for issuing
an operating certificate but it could be approved within the month.
Trump had said he wanted to begin the service under his name this
month.
   Leyden said the FAA has to determine whether Trump has the
ability to run a safe airline by examining all his plans, including
pilot training, maintenance and operating procedures.
   Once the FAA gives its approval, the sale by Texas Air Corp.,
Eastern's Houston-based holding company, can become final and Trump
can repaint the shuttle's 17 Boeing 727 jetliners with his name and
gold, red and black stripes.
   Texas Air has been trying to sell off the Shuttle and some other
Eastern assets, arguing that it needs cash for Eastern to survive.
   A federal judge approved the sale last December over objections
from labor leaders who said it was part of a Texas Air effort to
dismantle Eastern and reconstruct it as a nonunion company.
   Judge Barrington D. Parker, in his opinion, recognized the
union-management struggle but said it was also plausible that the
company was trying to rebuild and place itself on sound financial
footing.
   The union has said it would appeal the decision.
   Trump already owns a helicopter service that flies between
Atlantic City, where he owns casinos, and New York City, where he
has built up a real estate empire. He announced an agreement to
purchase the shuttle service last October.
   Eastern says the shuttle, which employs 850 people and makes 62
flights a day, made average annual profits of $17 million over the
last five years while the airline itself lost $233.7 million in the
first nine months of 1988.
   Trump has vowed to recognize unions representing pilots, flight
attendants and mechanics but has not guaranteed current wages.
Eastern has offered to retain any shuttle workers who wish to remain
with the company.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Italian Family $1.5 Million In JAL Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state jury on Friday ordered Boeing Co. to pay
$1.5 million in damages to the family of an Italian man and his son
who were among the 520 people who died in the 1985 crash of a Japan
Air Lines Boeing 747 in Japan.
   Attorneys for the Italian widow, Heidi Moroni, 48, and her
18-year-old son, Alessandro, had sought more than $6 million in
damages from the Seattle-based airplane company, said Boeing lawyer
Tom McLaughlin.
   Killed were Giancarlo Moroni and a second son, Andrea Moroni.
   Boeing has admitted liability in the crash, saying improper
repairs it made after the plane scraped its tail during a hard
landing in 1978 were to blame.
   The King County Superior Court jurors deliberated a day and a
half before returning their decision.
   The amount of damages was the only issue to be decided in the
Moroni case and three others, all involving non-Japanese victims,
that are pending in King County.
   Damage suits filed on behalf of 71 Japanese nationals against
Boeing and Japan Air Lines have been moved to Japan for trial.
   According to Japanese press reports last month, there have been
out-of-court settlements with families of 377 of the crash victims.
   McLaughlin described the award as ``reasonable,'' and said the
only portion Boeing might challenge is $200,000 for the suffering
endured by the two in the half-hour the damaged plane remained aloft
before it crashed into a mountain.
   The plane lost its tail and rudder 12 minutes after takeoff, and
over the next half-hour the pilot fought to regain control of the
crippled jet. Four survived the crash.

   Cornell University has completed its
investigation of the graduate student suspected of starting a

a school official said.
   The university will not make its findings public until the report
is actually completed during the next few weeks, M. Stuart Lynn,
vice president for Information Technologies at Cornell and a member
of the investigative panel, said Friday.
   The student, Robert T. Morris, 23, is on indefinite leave from

face in connection with the Nov. 2 incident.
   Authorities accuse Morris of developing the virus that replicated
itself nationwide in computers using the Defense Department's
ARPANET computer network. Federal authorities are reportedly
undecided about whether to charge Morris with a felony or
misdemeanor.

<HEAD>Critics Say Consult Arrangement Promotes Conflict of Interest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Environmental Protection Agency wanted
to prepare an annual report to Congress on its Superfund toxic waste
cleanup program, it sought out a consultant.
   ICF Inc. prepared the document for $260,000. Congressional
critics maintain that little more than the letterhead was changed on
the draft received from the private company before it was sent to
Capitol Hill.
   ``Three words were changed, two `ands' and a `the','' complained
Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., who held a hearing Friday on the
widespread use of private consultants by the federal agency
responsible for cleaning up the environment.
   He said one of his major concerns is that many of the consultants
working for the EPA ``also have private sector clients from the very
industries the EPA is charged with regulating'' raising questions
about conflict of interest.
   Pryor and other critics suggested that the EPA _ and most likely
other federal agencies and departments as well _ are relying too
heavily on private contractors to do work, including critical
analysis and often decision-making, that the government ought to be
doing.
   EPA officials acknowledged in testimony before Pryor's Government
Affairs subcommittee that they make extensive use of consultants,
but maintained that precautions are taken to avoid a conflict of
interest. They insisted that decision-making remains in agency hands.
   ``It comes down to workload. It's a matter of resources,'' Henry
Longest, director of the EPA's Superfund cleanup program, where
contractors are used widely, told the Senate panel.
   But Pryor, who has waged a decade-long fight against the federal
government's extensive use of private consultants, did not accept
the explanation.
   ``Consultants do everything from working on enforcing compliance
with EPA regulations to writing EPA's annual reports,'' Pryor
declared in opening the hearing. ``It appears that the basic work of
EPA has been delegated to private consultants.''
   The senator cited the case of a Florida subcontractor found by
congressional investigators to have recommended a particular cleanup
method for a toxic waste dump. It turned out that the same company
owned the rights for that cleanup method and was given the job, said
Pryor.
   Pryor also cited the EPA contracts with ICF Inc., including the
one for preparing the agency's annual report to Congress on
Superfund, as another example where questions of conflict of
interest might be raised.
   While ICF Inc., has several so-called ``sliding'' contracts with
the EPA valued for as much as $15 million, it also aggressively
seeks business with private companies that are subject to EPA
regulation and ``boasts of its EPA connection in its promotional
literature,'' said Pryor.
   Earlier this week the Office of Technology Assessment, which is
Congress' scientific research agency, also criticized the EPA for
relying too much on contractors in its Superfund cleanup program,
suggesting that contractors and not EPA officials are running the
program.
   Superfund is the $8.5 billion program through which the EPA is
tackling hundreds of toxic waste cleanup projects across the country.

<TEXT>
   A program to help prevent the spread of
AIDS among intravenous drug abusers by distributing free sterile
needles has been delayed due to a shortage of disposable syringes,
organizers said.
   The sponsoring agencies, Portland-based Outside In and the
American Foundation for AIDS Research, had planned for the program
to begin in July but had difficulty insuring the program.
   The groups found a company in November to provide medical
liability insurance, but National Union Fire Insurance Co.
stipulated that the distributed needles must be of such a design
that they could not be re-used.
   Outside In has been negotiating with a British company to supply
single-use hypodermic syringes, agency director Kathy Oliver said
Wednesday. Delivery had been promised Jan. 1, but the manufacturer
can't mass produce them, she said.
   Oliver said the supplier is having 1,500 syringes manufactured
each month. Outside In will need a couple of thousand each month for
its distribution program, she said.
   She said she didn't know when the supply problem would be
resolved.
   Epidemiologists have said that direct blood contamination through
shared needles is the most rapid way acquired immune deficiency
syndrome is being spread.

<TEXT>
   A ship laden with more than 50 tons of
equipment headed toward the Antarctic today to try and contain an
oil spill that experts say is killing wildlife and threatening to
wipe out a colony of baby penguins.
   The spill, from a sunken Argentine supply ship, has fouled the
once-pure waters of a pristine bay and was endangering more than
24,000 penguins and other nesting birds, said biologist Ted De Laca.
   ``It's very disturbing. Everything right now is worrisome,'' said
De Laca, a researcher at the Palmer Station, a U.S. research outpost
on the Antarctic Peninsula.
   About 52 tons of equipment flown from the United States was
loaded onto the 219-foot Polar Duke here from a giant U.S. Air Force
C-5 Galaxy cargo plane.
   The Polar Duke departed shortly after 6 p.m. Friday and was
expected to reach the area in four days.
   The oil is leaking from the Argentine research and supply ship
Bahia Paraiso, which is trapped and nearly submerged on shoals in
the Bismarck Strait just off the Antarctic peninsula.
   Thousands of penguins, terns, gulls and other birds live around
the site of the accident, and the waters teem with marine life,
including whales. Two areas nearby are set aside by the Antarctic
Treaty for scientific study.
   Punta Arenas is at the windblown tip of South America about 600
miles from the stricken Argentine vessel.
   Thomas Forhan, ocean projects manager for the National Science
Foundation in Washington, leads the cleanup mission.
   American scientists, wearing respirators as protection against
the smell of oil fumes, are working in open boats to try to limit
the damage, but De Laca said ``virtually all of the area is exposed
to fuel,'' causing young birds to disappear and killing small sea
animals ``in large numbers.''
   De Laca spoke by telephone with the The Associated Press in
Washington.
   About 24,000 penguins nest in rookeries in the affected area, and
De Laca said 38 of the 40 adult birds checked by scientists have
been ``fuel-dipped.''
   The fear of the experts, he said, is that penguin chicks, due to
leave nests within a few days, will swim in the oil-coated water and
be sickened or killed. At least three dead penguins have been
sighted, said De Laca.
   ``All of the rookeries are surrounded by oil,'' he said.
   A number of seals were seen to be covered with oil and were
acting in a ``lethargic fashion,'' said the scientist.
   ``We have a slick 150 meters (yards) by 2 miles long going south
from the vessel,'' moving ``along and a little bit away'' from the
coast, Forhan said in an interview aboard the Polar Duke.
   He said there were reports of birds smothered by oil and of dead
krill, shrimp-like creatures that whales feed upon in large numbers,
floating ashore.
   Scientists and workers at Palmer Station collected 112 compressed
gas cylinders and 15 oil drums from the waters around the wreck,
Forhan said, and ``there are more in the water.''
   The Bahia Paraiso ran aground Jan. 25. The more than 250 people
aboard were taken off without injury.
   Authorities said the ship carried at least 200,000 gallons of
fuel oil in its tanks and more in drums lashed to the deck.

   President Bush says U.S.-Japanese relations
entail ``some confrontation at times'' and vows to make sure that
American businesses gain fair access to markets in that nation.
   Bush spoke Friday at a White House luncheon for U.S. business
leaders as Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita wrapped up a
two-day visit to Washington.
   Takeshita was leaving Friday night for Los Angeles and a meeting
there next week with former President Reagan.
   Speaking of the barriers U.S. companies face entering Japanese
markets, Bush pledged ``to do my level best ... to be sure that we
are treated fairly, that we have access, that we ... are not
operating under standards that favor one side to the detriment of
the other.''
   Bush observed that he and Takeshita ``are realistic men ... and
we realize we are going to have some confrontation at times, or
certainly differences of opinion.''
   The president added that he believes the prime minister ``wants
very much to have a cooperative relationship.''
   On Thursday, the two men pledged after their 2{-hour meeting and
lunch to strive to smooth irritations over the $50 billion U.S.
deficit with Japan and tensions over the Japanese contributions to
its defense effort.
   Bush did not elaborate on the details of the trade problems he
and the prime minister discussed on Thursday, but said they'd
``reviewed the progress that our nations have achieved in bringing
the economies into better balance and of further opening our markets
to each other's goods and services.''
   He added that the United States carries ``a disproportionate
responsibility for the defense requirements of free countries'' and
Japan, ``given its economic standing today, is willing to accept
much more in the way of responsibility for helping ... in the whole
development aid side of things.''
   ``I just wanted to assure you that the visit yesterday had gone
reasonably well,'' Bush told the businessmen.
   As the president spoke, Secretary of State James A. Baker III bid
Takeshita a formal farewell at the end of his two-day Washington
visit with a State Department luncheon of champagne toasts, pheasant
and ice cream with mangoes.
   In remarks at the luncheon, the secretary of state also struck a
cautionary note, telling Takeshita the two economic superpowers
``still face a difficult agenda.'' Baker also expressed hope the
partnership will grow stronger as Japan assumes a broader world role.
   ``Japan is determined to do its utmost to collaborate with the
United States, its strongest ally, for the peace and security of the
world,'' the prime minister said, in his toast.
   ``No problems are unsolvable as long as Japan and the United
States join in an effort to solve them,'' Takeshita said.

<HEAD>Environmental Damage Grows From Antarctica Fuel Oil Spill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Birds and other wildlife in one of the most
remote parts of the world are being injured and killed by fuel oil
spilled from a ship wrecked on an Antarctica island, and more damage
is possible before cleanup crews arrive.
   Biologist Ted De Laca, chief scientist at Palmer Station in
Antarctica, said that more than 24,000 penguins and other birds are
endangered by an oil spill that threatens to wipe an entire
generation of chicks maturing in nests surrounded by the pollution.
Some wildlife already has been killed, he said.
   ``The environment has been compromised in a way that we can't
even evaluate right now,'' De Laca said in a telephone conference
call from Palmer Station. ``It's very disturbing. Everything right
now is worrisome.''
   Palmer Station scientists, wearing respirators to protect against
the eye-stinging fumes of the oil slick, worked in open boats to
recover debris littering the fouled bay and to evaluate the damage.
   But De Laca said a more effective effort to contain the spill
must await the arrival Monday of a Navy oil pollution control team
from the United States.
   He said the fuel oil is spilling from the Argentine ship Bahia
Paraiso at the rate of about two gallons a minute and if it
continues the vessel could dump about 250,000 gallons into the
previously pure, untainted waters nearby.
   The ship, which doubled as a cruise ship and a supply vessel for
an Argentine research station, ran aground near Palmer Station last
Saturday. It later floated free, went aground again 1.1 miles from
the U.S. outpost and then turned over on its right side against
another island. As it turned, fuel oil and deck cargo spilled into
the Palmer Station embayment, home to a number of large bird
rookeries.
   Palmer Station is a National Science Foundation research station.
Twenty-six scientists and staff are now working at the station under
the director of De Laca, the chief scientist. Palmer is about 600
miles south of Cape Horn, the tip of South America.
   De Laca reported that krill, a tiny shrimp-like crustacean, have
been killed by the thousands and are lining the nearby beaches.
Birds feeding on the krill seem sickened, he said. In a nesting area
of the Polar Skua, a bird of prey, up to 40 percent of the chicks
have disappeared, possibily because parent birds sickened by the oil
are unable to protect their young, he said.
   About 24,000 penguins nest in rookies in the affected area, and
De Laca said that 38 of 40 adult birds checked by scientists have
been ``fuel dipped.''
   A number of seals were seen to be covered with oil and were
acting in a ``lethargic fashion,'' said the scientist.
   The precise number of animals killed by the oil is difficult to
calculate because other animals quickly eat the dead. ``It's pretty
depressing,'' he said.

   Royalty watchers who couldn't get enough of
Princess Diana's visit to New York can catch a glimpse of Princess
Anne when she comes to the United States for the 1989 Volvo World
Cup equestrian competition.
   Buckingham Palace confirmed Thursday that the 38-year-old
princess, fourth in line to the British throne, will visit the
competition. It will be held April 12-16 at the Florida State
Fairgrounds' Bob Thomas Equestrian Center.
   According to Winkie Howell, a member of Tampa's World Cup
Committee, the princess usually appears at the finals. He said her
anticipated visit ``points up the magnitude of the World Cup to
people who are not familiar with it.''
   As many as 160,000 people are expected to attend the equestrian
festival, which will be broadcast live by satellite to 250 million
people worldwide.

   Singer Ray Charles says he prefers the
song ``America the Beautiful'' over ``The Star-Spangled Banner''
because it's easier to sing and more graphic.
   Charles, commenting in the Broadcast Music Inc. publication Music
World, said the range of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' extends an
octave and a fifth.
   ``Few people can reach both ends with comfort,'' he said in the
winter issue of the publication. Additionally, he described the

   Publishing magnate Malcolm Forbes is the
new owner of a 1749 document that is believed to be one of the last
remaining royal charters in New Jersey.
   Forbes, who collects rare documents and purchased the Bedminster
township charter from a private collector, said Thursday he will
display the charter in a climate-controlled case at his New Jersey
office building. The document was originally given to Bedminster
Township by King George II of Great Britain.
   Bedminster Mayor Joseph Cirona said the asking price for the
charter was $20,000 to $25,000, but the purchase price was not
disclosed.
   The document was believed lost in an 1845 fire that destroyed the
home of a town clerk who stored it in a desk. But in 1918, the
Somerset County Historical Quarterly revealed that the document had
somehow survived.
   Forbes' son Christopher said the relic is one of the last
remaining royal charters in the state. He said it grants Bedminster
the right ``to be and remain a perpetual township and community in
word and in deed, to be called and known by the name of the Township
of Bedminster.''

   Jim Moody's week didn't exactly follow the
classic lines of a Hollywood script, but it did have a kind of happy
ending.
   The man who portrayed a teacher at the High School of Performing
Arts in the 1980 movie ``Fame'' lost and then regained his real-life
job as a drama teacher at the school for aspiring actors and dancers.
   He holds a temporary teaching certificate and was told Wednesday
he was being replaced by a drama teacher with a permanent license
and more seniority.
   But on Friday the United Federation of Teachers announced that an
agreement had been reached with the Board of Education for Moody to
remain in the drama class and team-teach with his replacement, said
union spokesman Bert Shanas.
   Team-teaching puts more than one teacher in the same classroom
and takes advantage of each teacher's special skills, Shanas said.
   Moody said he chose to teach with a temporary license because it
meant he could take acting jobs. He has appeared in eight movies.

   Soviet human rights activist Andrei Sakharov is
planning another visit to Boston, this time with his wife, Yelena
Bonner, friends and family members said.
   The Sakharovs are scheduled to fly from Moscow to Rome next week.
After five days in Italy, they plan to visit Canada and then fly to
Boston to see Mrs. Bonner's children.
   Mrs. Bonner's daughter, Tatiana Yankelevich of Newton, said
Friday the dates of the Boston visit are still uncertain.
   Although both Sakharov and Bonner have visited the United States
before, this will be their first trip here together.
   Sakharov, 67, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his defense
of human rights in his homeland. After speaking out against the
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979, he was exiled to the
closed industrial city of Gorky, about 250 miles from Moscow.
   Mrs. Bonner was banished there as well in 1984, and the couple
remained in Gorky until Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev personally
called them back to Moscow in December 1986.

   Premier Andreas Papandreou has publicly
scolded his American-born wife for delaying a meeting to discuss
their divorce plans.
   ``I asked and hoped that the divorce procedure would be set into
motion before Mrs. Papandreou left for the United States, but she
refused,'' the premier said in a statement Friday.
   Margaret Papandreou left for a monthlong trip to the United
States Friday. The premier's 66-year-old wife is a native of
Elmhurst, Ill.
   Mrs. Papandreou, who heads Greece's largest feminist
organization, is expected to make a brief stopover today in Milan,
Italy, to attend a conference of the European Socialist and Leftist
Women.
   Papandreou who will celebrate his 70th birthday on Sunday, has
been living with his 34-year-old girlfriend, former airline
stewardess Dimitra Liani.
   He is expected to marry Ms. Liani, herself twice divorced, when
his marriage is officially dissolved. It would be Papandreou's third
marriage.
   Mrs. Papandreou responded by accusing the premier of distorting
the truth and said that ``the premier and I decided to meet after my
return from the United States.''

<TEXT>
   David Hill, the U.S. fugitive and
jungle cult leader jailed two years ago for manslaughter, has
suffered a serious stroke, his second in three months, doctors said.
   Hill, 60, who calls himself Rabbi Edward Washington, was
transferred from prison to Georgetown Hospital earlier this week
after a stroke caused partial paralysis to his left side. A stroke
in November paralyzed his right side.
   The former leader of the now-defunct House of Israel was
convicted in Guyana in 1986 and sentenced to 20 years in jail for
ordering the killing of one of his followers, James Maion.
   Hill, whose hospital room Friday was heavily guarded by police,
is also suffering from diabetes and a heart condition. Visitors were
not allowed in to see him.
   Hill fled to this former British colony on the northeast coast of
South America in 1971 after being convicted of extortion and jumping
bail in Cleveland.
   By the early 1980s, Hill claimed a following of 10,000 and 47
``synagogues.''
   His House of Israel, which had no connection with Judaism, became
known for breaking up political opposition meetings. After the death
in 1985 of socialist President Forbes Burnham, President Desmond
Hoyte launched an investigation of the cult leading to Hill's
conviction for manslaughter.

   New allegations against Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower aren't expected to delay further a
vote by the Senate Armed Services Committee on his nomination, says
the ranking Republican on the panel.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., declined on Friday to say what the
information dealt with. But other sources indicated it concerned
Tower's personal life, and specifically alcohol and women.
   ``It's just another chapter in an ongoing investigation,'' Warner
said. ``I don't attach any more significance to this chapter than to
any other.''
   He said an FBI report on the subject should reach the committee
``on Monday and ... we can proceed to a vote Tuesday or Wednesday.''
   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the FBI was looking into allegations concerning ``Tower's behavior
at a party last year in Houston.''
   CBS News reported that the allegations involve an alleged liaison
in Houston between Tower and a woman from an Eastern bloc nation,
along with an allegation of excessive drinking in the past year.
   According to ABC News, the new allegations include a report from
an Air Force colonel which said Tower had 14 separate liaisons with
women while he headed the U.S. negotiating team in Geneva after
leaving the Senate.
   The committee had been expected to vote Thursday to recommend
Senate confirmation of Tower, but that was postponed after the
emergence of the new allegations.
   Tower, meanwhile, sought to dispel any impression of an embattled
nominee, meeting for about two hours at his Jefferson Hotel
residence with five people likely to be named to deputy posts at the
Pentagon.
   He later issued a statement, saying the meeting had been
scheduled for a week ``and had nothing to do with the proceedings
before the Senate Armed Services Committee.''
   Editorials in Defense News and Army Times, two widely circulated
industry publications, called for Tower to withdraw his nomination.
The editorials are scheduled to appear in Monday's editions.
   Army Times, a 49-year-old independent publication, said Tower's
public position ``has been so compromised by the agonizing process
by which he was nominated and is being confirmed ... that he cannot
be the strong spokesman the Defense Department needs now.''
   Defense News, also an independent publication, suggested Tower's
links to defense consultants is the most troubling aspect of the
recent confirmation process, and said, ``There is ample reason to
doubt whether Mr. Tower is the man for these times.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``Our
feeling is he will be confirmed. Whenever you have a candidate who
is undergoing this kind of scrutiny there are always things that
turn up. We will await the final judgment.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said he did not think it was ``necessary at this time to
withdraw the nomination.''
   Tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before
his nomination. In divorce papers filed two years ago by his second
wife, Lilla Burt Cummings, Tower was accused of ``marital
misconduct.''
   Tower, who has been divorced twice, is now single.

<HEAD>Most Prospective Jurors Had Little Interest in Iran-Contra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 32 people sent into the jury pool this week
in the trial of Oliver North have one thing in common: All say they
know almost nothing about North and the Iran-Contra affair.
   Most of the prospective jurors said they simply glance at
front-page newspaper headlines and most say they are too busy with
jobs or occupied with other interests to have paid much attention to
the biggest foreign policy debacle of the Reagan administration.
   Most are blue- or pink-collar workers, several with the
government, while several others are unemployed or retired. One
woman is holding down two jobs.
   Of the first 25 prospective jurors, a dozen finished the 12th
grade, one has a master's degree, two others finished college and
another has some college education.
   Their occupations range from cement finisher to mental health
administrator and the focus of their lives is work and family, not
politics and controversy.
   On Friday, one of the prospective jurors, a woman who supervises
50 employees at the Willard Hotel in Washington, explained that she
circled the name Joseph Coors on the jurors' questionnaire as a name
with which she is familiar because substantial amounts of the
brand-name beer are delivered to the hotel.
   Occasional talk by co-workers about the Iran-Contra affair, said
the woman, had bored her during her 10- to 12-hour workdays.
   Coors, who contributed money to the Contras after meeting with
North, is scheduled to testify for the prosecution at North's trial.
   North attorney Brendan Sullivan told the woman that the name on
the cans is the same as the name on the questionnaire and that the
beer magnate would be pleased to know ``you buy a lot of it.''
   North, who took the nationally televised congressional
Iran-Contra hearings by storm in 1987, has through smiles and
gestures made contact from across the courtroom with the potential
jurors who will decide his fate.
   But it is unclear whether he has made much of an impression with
jurors who say they just barely recall having seen pictures of him
in uniform a year and a half ago.
   One man sent into the jury pool thought North might be the man
who kept ``blinking'' and ``winking'' at him constantly as the
prospective juror underwent questioning from U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell, prosecutor John Keker and Sullivan.
   North signaled that the prospective juror had guessed right by
giving him a thumbs-up sign.
   Gesell said as he concluded Friday's court session that he wants
a pool of 45 people to choose a panel of 12 jurors and six
alternates. The jury selection process resumes Monday.

<HEAD>Documents Say Steinbrenner's Felony Conviction a Humiliation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1974 felony conviction of New York Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner hurt his business interests and was a
source of personal humiliation, according to his successful
application for a presidential pardon.
   Former President Reagan granted the pardon just before he left
office last month.
   For example, the papers note:
   Last summer, Minnesota racing officials denied Steinbrenner an
owner's license at Canterbury Downs, the state's first parimutuel
thoroughbred racetrack, because of his conviction;
   Against his wishes, Steinbrenner declined a nomination to serve
as a member of the Board of Regents governing Florida's public
universities ``because of the adverse publicity to the Florida
educational system that would likely ensue.''
   And he has suffered the indignity of being referred to in
articles as ``a convicted felon'' and the ``only convicted felon
among baseball's ownership.''
   ``The harm suffered by Mr. Steinbrenner is far more than
economic; it is a symbolic slap in the face for a man who has tried
so hard to overcome his conviction and be a good citizen,''
Steinbrenner's lawyer, former attorney general and senator William
B. Saxbe, wrote in the application.
   The documents were obtained by The Associated Press after a
special application to the Justice Department.
   Steinbrenner was pardoned Jan. 19 by Reagan, 17 years after he
attempted to ``influence and intimidate'' employees of his
shipbuilding company into lying to a grand jury about the nature of
a $100,000 contribution to Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign.
   Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate federal
election laws. He was fined $15,000 but received no prison sentence.

<HEAD>Deaver Abandons Perjury Appeal, Cites Desire to Put it Behind Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Michael K. Deaver says
he is broke and tired of being ``a captive of the system.''
   So, on Friday, he dropped the appeal of his conviction of lying
to a congressional subcommittee and a federal grand jury, saying he
wanted to ``put this period of my life behind me.''
   Deaver, a top adviser to former President Reagan and a close
friend of the former first family, said in a statement issued by his
lawyers that he was dropping the appeal ``with the firm belief that
I was not guilty of the charges of which I was convicted.''
   However, he said, ``to proceed with this appeal means to continue
to live in doubt, to continue to wait for a decision, and, if my
appeal is successful, to face another trial, a process which could
mean another two years of agony and doubt.''
   He also said he could not continue the ``financial burden'' of
the appeals process.
   The 50-year-old onetime Reagan deputy chief of staff was fined
$100,000 and ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service for
his three felony convictions in 1987 of lying about his lobbying of
former administration colleagues after leaving the White House.
   ``My decision to withdraw my appeal does not come easily,''
Deaver said in the statement issued as his lawyers asked the
appellate court here to dismiss his appeal.
   ``It results from a number of factors, primarily my desire to put
this period of my life behind me and get on with whatever lies
ahead,'' Deaver said.
   Deaver must now begin performing the community service which U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson set as a condition of three
years of probation when he sentenced him last September. Jackson has
not yet specified what type of community service he will order.
   Deaver said his ``belief in my innocence has not changed from the
day the long and arduous proceedings against me began three years
ago.''
   Deaver resigned as deputy White House chief of staff in 1985 to
start a Washington public relations firm. He was convicted in
December 1987 of lying under oath to the House Energy and Commerce
oversight and investigations subcommittee and a grand jury.

   About 3,000 people were evacuated from the East End
after a large unexploded German bomb dating from World War II was
discovered at a housing site, Scotland Yard reported.
   Army bomb disposal officers called to the scene Friday worked
through the night, but the Defense Ministry said in a statement it
could take two days to render the 1,000-pound bomb harmless.
   The statement said the explosives would have to be steamed out of
the bomb because it was considered too dangerous to try to transport
the bomb from the area.
   The bomb was found standing upright against a wall in
Whitechapel, haunt of the notorious murderer Jack the Ripper, who
killed five women in 1888 and was never caught.
   It was unearthed by a mechanical digger driven by Edward
Thornton, who was digging excavations for new houses.
   Bombs dropped during the war that failed to go off are
periodically unearthed in London. The East End was especially
heavily bombed by the Germans during the war in a bid to cripple the
London docks.
   Police cordoned off the area and authorities evacuated people
from their homes around the Sidney Street housing project.
   Those evacuated stayed with friends and relatives or at local
council offices that were hurridly turned into temporary shelters.
   Twenty roads into the area also were closed to traffic.

<TEXT>
   The nation's biggest leveraged buyout now
depends on which of the two corporations involved makes the best
ketchup, nuts and Chinese food.
   In a decision announced Friday, the Federal Trade Commission said
it would not challenge the $24.5 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. if KKR within a year sells:
   _The Chun King oriental line of RJR Nabisco or the La Choy line
of Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson Inc., a unit of KKR.
   _The Planters nuts line of RJR Nabisco or the Fisher nuts line of
Beatrice.
   _And RJR Nabisco's Del Monte ketchup or Beatrice's Hunt ketchup.
   Together, the corporations account for one-eighth of the food
sold in the nation's supermarkets. The FTC said the two must reduce
their share of the markets for ketchup, oriental foods and packaged
nuts, in order for the market to remain competitive.
   A spokesman for KKR said that to his knowledge, no decisions had
been made on which product lines to keep and which to sell off.
   KKR's tender offer for RJR Nabisco shares was to expire at
midnight EST Monday, but KKR late Friday extended its offer to 10
a.m. EST Thursday. The second step of the merger process, involving
the exchange of securities not tendered to KKR, must still occur and
there is no time limit for completion of that portion of the deal.
   Under an agreement between the FTC and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts,
KKR must maintain RJR Nabisco as a separate operation until the
three product lines are sold.
   Before divestitures, the merged company would control about 12{
percent to 13 percent of the market for manufactured foods, said
Jeffrey Zuckerman, head of the commission's Bureau of Competition.
   Zuckerman declined to give estimates of market share held by each
of the lines but did give these estimates if the brands were
combined: Chun King-La Choy, ``probably slightly under 60 percent''
of $300 million in sales; Del Monte-Hunt ketchup, about 25 percent
of $500 million; and Planters-Fisher nuts, ``about 50 percent'' of
$1.5 billion.
   Although market share is a concern, ``we look at other factors,
the most important of which is the ease with which other people
could enter the business'' if the company tried to raise prices, he
said.

   Pierrepont I. ``Perry'' Prentice, the
publisher of Time Magazine during World War Two, has died after a
long bout with strokes and other illnesses. He was 89.
   Prentice, a resident of Belleair, was also one of the nation's
leading authorities on property tax. He frequently spoke and wrote
on the subject, which he said fascinated him since he was editor and
publisher of House and Home magazine. He died Thursday.
   Born in Newark, N.J., Prentice served as a second lieutenant in
World War I, then graduated cum laude from Yale University in 1920
with Henry Luce, the founder and first publisher of Time.
   Luce asked Prentice to help him begin Time Magazine, but the
future publisher turned him down, according to Prentice's widow,
Janet.
   ``He told Henry Luce `No, I don't want to go straight into that,
I want to be a reporter first','' Mrs. Prentice said Friday.
   Prentice reported for the New York Tribune and later reported or
edited newspapers in Camden, N.J., New Bedford, Mass., and
Philadelphia.
   In 1929, Prentice joined Time Inc. as business manager of Fortune
magazine. A year later he became circulation director of Time, Life
and Fortune magazines. Time Inc. made him a vice president in 1939
and vice president for corporate affairs in 1945. He was the
publisher of Time magazine from 1941 to 1945.
   Later posts included editor and publisher of Architectural Forum
and House and Home, when Time published them. Widely known in the
housing industry, Prentice had been a board member of the National
Association of Homebuilders Research Foundation and a founder of the
Housing Industry Presidents Council.
   Prentice was chairman of the National Council for Property Tax
Reform when he retired to Florida from West Hampton Beach, N.Y.
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters and
three granddaughters.

   The Bush administration still publicly endorses
the Reagan administration's approach toward solving the $1.3
trillion Third World debt problem and is searching for ways to make
that approach more workable.
   Discussion on Third World debt dominated two days of meetings
that wrapped up Friday between finance officials of the
non-communist world's seven most powerful economies _ the United
States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   The meetings had been billed as a get-acquainted session for the
new Bush administration as it completed its second week in office.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who was host for the
discussions along with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, said
that a review of conditions around the world showed the global
economy was performing reasonably well, an opinion that was seconded
by his fellow finance ministers.
   Tatsuo Murayama, the new Japanese finance minister who was
attending his first Group of Seven meeting, said that he believed
prospects for the world economy were brighter than they were five
months ago because currency fluctuations had stabilized and
inflation appeared to be moderating.
   Brady said that the seven countries had a ``thorough discussion''
regarding Third World debt with no decisions being taken.
   ``Several ideas were discussed for strengthening the agreed-on
strategy based on the same principles we consider valid,'' Brady
said. ``Growth, economic policy changes and reforms in the debtor
countries, the continued need for external financing (by debtor
nations) and continued observance of the case-by-case method.''
   These were all goals of the Baker plan, drafted in 1985 by
Brady's predecessor, James A. Baker III. Baker, who is secretary of
state in the Bush administration, crafted an approach to Third World
debt that stressed increased loans in exchange for economic reforms
made by the developing countries.
   While the United States repeatedly rejected calls to forgive some
of the debt, America has found itself increasingly isolated on the
debt issue as political stresses have risen in debtor countries.
These nations are suffering falling living standards because of the
growing burdens they face in servicing their huge debts.
   While Brady made no mention of any modifications he would like to
see to the debt plan, other finance ministers said they believed
changes would be proposed and possibly adopted at the group's next
meeting, in early April, when the International Monetary Fund holds
its spring meeting in Washington.
   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said the officials
examined a number of options, including proposals made by the French
to create a new international fund to guarantee interest payments by
the poorer nations and a Japanese proposal to provide more money for
loans.
   Bush has pledged to review the American policy on Third World
debt, but so far the administration has not revealed any
modifications to the Baker plan that it would consider acceptable.
   The meetings of the ``Group of Seven'' are generally held three
or four times a year to review economic conditions and search for
ways the countries can better coordinate policies to promote global
prosperity.
   At present, the issues of concern are efforts to stabilize
currencies, lower the still-huge trade imbalances which exist and
provide relief to Latin American nations straining under a heavy
debt burden.
   Participants said that Brady assured the other nations of
President Bush's commitment to lower the budget deficit, a longtime
matter of concern with U.S. allies who believe America's huge
borrowing needs have deprived their economies of needed capital.
   Brady said that Bush was seeking to cooperate with Congress to
find a way to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by $60 billion in the
next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, officials said.
   Participants said that finance ministers were generally pleased
with how the effort at greater policy coordination was working,
including the drive to prevent wild fluctuations in the value of the
dollar. In contrast to past meetings when the U.S. greenback was
under heavy selling pressure, the dollar at present has been
relatively stable.

   Robert Mosbacher pledged at his swearing in as
secretary of commerce to use his office to expand overseas markets,
protect fair trade and protect the country's beaches and waterways
from pollution.
   The 61-year-old Texas oilman said Friday he would promote
economic growth and competitiveness by ``expanding overseas markets
with U.S. goods and services while ensuring fair competition through
effective enforcement of our trade laws.''
   He also singled out as a priority the protection of the nation's
waters and shores through efforts of his department's National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``More work can and must be done,'' he said. ``We have been
blessed with an abundance of beautiful natural resources, including
our oceans, our estuaries, our beaches, our shorelines, and we must
do all in our power to preserve and protect these precious assets.''
   The ceremony was attended by President Bush, who hailed his
longtime friend and fellow Texan as a ``savvy international
businessman'' who would be a key member of the administration's
economic team.
   Taking note of Mosbacher's background as an accomplished sailor,
Bush said Mosbacher ``will now take the helm at Commerce and help
chart America's economic course into a new era of prosperity.''
   The oath of office was administered by Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, another longtime friend and fellow Texan. Mosbacher's
wife, Georgette, held the Bible upon which her husband placed his
hand while taking the oath.
   Mosbacher, Baker and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady were close
advisers to Bush during the presidential campaign.
   Mosbacher served as Bush's chief fund-raiser, bringing in
millions for the presidential campaign. He amassed his personal
fortune, estimated at more than $200 million, as the head of
Mosbacher Energy Co. of Houston.

<HEAD>Bush Chief Served Dual Role, Paper Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   White House Counsel and chief ethics adviser C.
Boyden Gray says he will continue to serve as chairman of his
family's large communications company but will give up the fee he
collected during his eight previous years as vice presidential
counsel, a published report says.
   The Washington Post also reported today that Gray was a very
active investor during those eight years, moving hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually in and out of the stock market and
various partnerships, including real estate, oil and gas,
electronic, computer and other high-tech companies.
   The Associated Press could not reach Gray at his home Friday
night.
   The Post said Gray told the paper Friday that in order to conform
with new ethics guidelines pledged by Bush, he will no longer accept
a fee from the family company, Summit Communications Inc. of Atlanta
which was founded by his father in 1948.
   He told the Post he has reduced his holdings to real estate
partnerships, government bonds and a multimillion-dollar interest in
Media General Corp., another communications giant.
   However, Gray said he does not see any need to further divest
himself or create a blind trust for his remaining investments, as
members of the Bush administration have been encouraged to do.
   Gray's past participation in the management of his investments,
currently estimated at $10 million, was reported as required on
government disclosure statements and did not violate the law.
   Gray served as general counsel to the Presidential Task Force on
Regulatory Relief, which Bush chaired, during Reagan's first term as
president.
   The panel was charged with reducing the burden of federal
regulation on private business _ a charter that theoretically could
have enabled it to affect the affairs of companies in which Gray
owned stock.
   ``I was my own ethics officer,'' Gray told the Post, adding that
he and his deputies ensured that he avoided any potential conflicts.

<HEAD>Aide Says Nixon Would Use Extra Pension Money to Pay for Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Richard Nixon says the former
president would use the controversial proposed pay raise for members
of Congress and the Cabinet and federal judges for security.
   Responding to a request by David Keating, executive vice
president of the National Taxpayers Union for Nixon to publicly
oppose the pay increase, spokesman John H. Taylor wrote in a letter:
``The Nixons are now paying for their own security, an expense of
over $500,000 since 1985.''
   ``It is RN's intention to apply whatever increase may be enacted
in his pension entirely toward defraying the cost of his and Mrs.
Nixon's security,'' Taylor added.
   The raise which would increase Cabinet salaries from $99,500 to
$155,000 would increase Nixon's pension as a former president by the
same amount because of a 1971 law linking the two amounts.
   The pay raises automatically go into effect unless they are
disapproved by both houses of Congress before Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Newly sworn Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.
says the department won't abandon its recommendation that a vast
wildlife refuge in northeastern Alaska be opened for gas and oil
exploration despite pressure from several powerful environmental
groups to review the decision.
   In his first news conference after being sworn in as interior
secretary Friday, Lujan told reporters President Bush ``has said we
should explore (the refuge) in an environmentally acceptable
manner'' and the question ``is out of my domain.''
   A recommendation endorsing development of the Alaska refuge was
sent to Congress by outgoing interior secretary Donald Hodel in the
final days of the Reagan administration.
   Congress must approve any such oil exploration, and legislation
has been introduced in both the Senate and House that would open the
refuge for drilling. But other legislation also has been introduced
that would make the refuge a wilderness area protected from
exploration.

<TEXT>
   When Soviet Jewish scientist Yakov Kogan
contacted Israeli officials in Paris last week to say he wanted to
defect, little did he know the complications he faced.
   First, he was told, ``Prove you are Jewish'' _ a serious problem
because Kogan had left his identity card thousands of miles away in
Moscow.
   What followed was a nightmarish saga of wrong airports,
problematic telephones, delays and mixed directions _ proving to
Kogan it wasn't as easy to defect as he may have thought.
   Kogan, a 48-year-old mathematician and computer expert, told the
Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot he first thought of defecting while
attending the scientific seminar as part of a six-member Soviet
delegation.
   ``I thought this was the chance to reach Israel. ... Who knows if
this opportunity would ever be repeated,'' he said in the interview
published Thursday.
   Kogan decided to phone Israeli diplomats in Paris. But the task
proved complicated.
   ``I did not want to phone from the hotel and I was looking for
public telephones. But soon I discovered you cannot use a coin for
every telephone and that for some you need a magnetic card,'' Kogan
said.
   Contact was finally established. But then came the Israeli
demand: ``Prove that you are Jewish.''
   Kogan's Soviet-issued identity card, which he left behind in
Moscow, stated he was Jewish. But the passport he carried made no
mention of his religion.
   According to Israel's Law of Return, all Jews are eligible for
automatic Israeli citizenship.
   ``They asked: `What Jewish holidays do you remember?''' Kogan
recalled. ``I told them with a stressed Yiddish accent: Rosh Hashana
(the Jewish New Year), Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), and of
course Shavuot (a holiday celebrating the spring harvest)'' he said.
   The officials were not immediately convinced. But the next day,
when Kogan called back, officials told him to take a taxi to Orly
Airport and go to the El Al (Israel's airline) counter.
   Kogan left all his belongings at a hotel, toured the Quai D'Orsay
museum and left for the airport. But there were more problems ahead.
   ``They only forgot to tell me that Orly is divided in two, West
and South, with the first one designated for internal flights
only,'' he told Yediot.
   When Kogan finally reached his destination, time was running out.
   ``I ... could not find the El Al counter. Then I started to walk
around slowly, and gradually saw the word `Tel Aviv' appearing on
display screens,'' the bespectacled, gray-haired Kogan said Thursday
on Israel Television.
   He said he passed through French passport control with the help
of an El Al official, who issued him an Israeli visa. Then he was
brought to an empty plane.
   ``They told me that I can relax now, that this is Israeli
territory,'' he said.
   Take-off was delayed for what seemed an endless 30 minutes, Kogan
said. Once the plane took off, he destroyed a piece of paper on
which he had written the number of his Israeli contacts in Paris, as
they had ordered.
   ``At (Tel Aviv's) Ben Gurion Airport, two men were waiting for
me. One of them asked: ``Why did you arrive alone? You could ask for
a visa and bring along your family.''
   Kogan left behind his wife, Asia, and two sons, aged 7 and 10. He
told Yediot he believed nothing would happen to them under the more
liberal policies of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He said he decided to defect because he felt progress in his
scientific career at a Moscow institute was stymied due to treatment
of Jews in the Soviet Union. He told Yediot that money played no
role _ both he and his wife were highly paid, lived in a three-room
apartment considered a luxury by Soviet standards and owned a summer
house near a forest.
   ``During all those years, I never asked to emigrate to Israel. I
knew I would be refused,'' apparently on grounds that he knew state
secrets, he said.

   Sign manufacturer Alex Goldenberg
demonstrated his product's impact in a very personal way at a trade
show by proposing to his girlfriend.
   Goldenberg typed his question into a computer Friday during the
Eastern Sign Show in this resort's Convention Center, with dozens of
clients inspecting the high-tech sign printers around him.
   His question was automatically carried to the sign printer which
then permanently embossed the message in vinyl.
   ``LANA! WILL YOU MARRY ME?'' were the words that popped up on the
screen in front of Lana Ritsman, who looked startled, then nervously
smiled.
   ``Why did you do it in front of all these people?'' she asked.
``Everybody is standing here watching us!''
   The crowd, meanwhile, waited for her response.
   A man shouted, ``Well, yes or no?''
   Ms. Ritsman, blushing, whispered ``yes'' and applause erupted.
Goldenberg placed a diamond engagement ring on her finger, and the
two kissed.
   Goldenberg, 31, and Ms. Ritsman, 21, are both from New York City.
They said they will marry in August.
   ``Oh, isn't this nice,'' a nearby saleswoman said.

<HEAD>Oil May Have Fueled Kenyan-Sudanese Clash Of the Cartographers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Call it the Muddle of the Maps or the Clash
of the Cartographers, but Kenya and Sudan are at it again over a
disputed area of dismal swamp and desert.
   The dispute goes back years, but neither side appeared to be
paying much attention to it until recently, and a discovery of oil
may have roiled their dispute over soil.
   In 1914, the British drew a straight line marking Kenya's
northwestern border with Sudan.
   But in 1938, the British, who then ruled the East African
nations, decided to give Kenya administrative control of a
triangular piece of land north of the Sudan border.
   The area, known as the Elemi Triangle, contained 1,393 square
miles of seemingly worthless land and was home to the nomadic
Turkana tribe, which was constantly raiding and being raided by
other tribes from Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda.
   The British administration in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, was
unable to police the raiders and handed over administration of the
area to authorities in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, which was much
closer.
   The 1938 agreement resulted in a new line on the map, this one
putting the triangle in Kenya. There the matter rested until 1956,
when Sudan gained its independence, followed by Kenya seven years
later.
   The newly independent governments began drawing their own maps _
Sudan's with the original 1914 straight line, Kenya's with the
triangular border.
   ``From that time on,'' said Sudan's charge d'affaires in Nairobi,
Ali Yousuf, ``We have had two opinions.''
   Yousuf told reporters Friday that a joint border commission met
in the late 1970s but failed to resolve the matter, and the dispute
once again faded.
   But last year, Yousuf said, Kenya published a new map that not
only included the Elemi Triangle within its borders but enlarged the
triangle by 2,489 square miles.
   Yousuf said he called the news conference ``to clarify the
position of the Sudan government.'' He was not, he insisted,
discussing ``our borders with Kenya through the press.''
   But most of the argument has been waged through reporters.
   The newly revived dispute began with a front-page story in
Monday's Kenya Times, an English-language daily published in Nairobi
by the ruling Kenya African National Union party.
   Headlined, ``It's a Map of Provocation,'' the story noted that
thousands of maps published by a Scottish company, John Bartholomew
and Son, Ltd., of Edenburgh, showed the straight 1914 border between
Kenya and Sudan.
   The next day, the newspaper's top story carried the banner
headline, ``Sudan Claims Kenyan Soil.''
   On Wednesday, at a reception for foreign journalists, Kenya's
foreign minister, Robert Ouko, made it a point to mention the
dispute.
   He, too, said he would not discuss the matter in the press, but
added, ``The Elemi Triangle is an integral part of Kenya and that's
the way it will remain.''
   The two governments have not officially discussed the problem
anew.
   Pressed Friday at the news conference, Yousuf said he didn't
``have enough information as to who is doing what in this disputed
area,'' but suggested Kenya may have found oil in the region.
President Daniel arap Moi announced last month oil had been found in
northern Kenya, but did not specify where.

   President Gen. Andres Rodriguez has
named a Cabinet made up largely of technocrats, several of whom
worked closely with ousted President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. They
include:
   _ Army Gen. Orlando Machuca Vargas, interior. A cavalry officer
who served many years under Rodriguez, he is the only active duty
military man on the Cabinet. He will be in charge of political
affairs, including elections; and the police.
   _ Luis Maria Argana, foreign relations. A constitutional lawyer,
he served as president of the Supreme Court until resigning last
August. He is regarded by many as a potential presidential candidate
if elections are called.
   _ Juan Ramon Chaves, minister without portfolio. The 87-year-old
Colorado Party leader headed the party for 25 consecutive years
until ousted by militant Stroessner backers in August 1987. Paraguay
lacks a vice presidency and this minister fills in when the
president is absent.
   _ Antonio Zuccolillo, industry and commerce. A prosperous
businessman and industrialist, he was Stroessner's ambassador to
Britain until 1987. He is the brother of Aldo Zuccolillo, whose
newspaper ABC Color was closed by the Stroessner government in 1984.
   _ Hernando Bertoni, agriculture. An agriculture engineer and only
Cabinet member to retain his post, he is the grandson of famed Swiss
naturalist Moises Bertoni, who came to Paraguay the last century to
study its flora and fauna.
   _ Enzo de Bernardi, treasury. An engineer, he runs the state
electric company, ANDE. The son of Italian immigrants, he fought for
Italy and was decorated for bravery in World War II.
   _ Dionisio Gonzalez Torres, education. Rector of the National
University and father of navy commander Eduardo Gonzalez.
   _ Porfirio Perreira Ruiz Diaz, public works. A retired general
and mayor of Asuncion since 1976. An engineer, he launched programs
to pave streets, build bridges and improve garbage collection.
   _ Alexis Frutos Vaesken, justice and labor. A former Supreme
Court member from 1983 to 1987.
   Still to be filled are the posts of health and national defense.

<TEXT>
   Death came to Oliver W. Sipple without any
of the fanfare that once anguished the disabled ex-Marine, who
became a reluctant hero when he foiled an assassination attempt on
President Gerald Ford.
   A friend found Sipple, 47, dead in his San Francisco apartment on
Thursday, apparently of natural causes. A framed letter of
commendation signed by Ford hung on the wall.
   Sipple gained unwanted fame on Sept. 22, 1975, when he lunged for
a .38-caliber chrome revolver aimed at Ford by would-be assassin
Sara Jane Moore outside a San Francisco hotel. His move caused
Moore's shot to go astray, hitting a building instead.
   Afterward, Sipple telephoned news outlets and begged them not to
mention his name, his address or ``anything about me.''
   ``I'm not a hero, I'm a live coward,'' he said later. ``It's
probably the scariest thing that ever happened in my whole life.''
   But reports about Sipple, some mentioning his homosexuality, were
published anyway.
   Sipple filed a $15 million invasion of privacy lawsuit against
several newspapers, claiming he was abandoned by his brothers and
sisters after they learned of his sexual orientation by reading
published accounts.
   ``My sexuality is part of my private life and has no bearing on
my response to the act of a person seeking to take the life of
another,'' he said in the lawsuit, which was filed five days after
the assassination attempt.
   He lost the five-year court battle when Superior Court Judge Ira
Brown dismissed the suit.
   ``I think that his life was a very tragic life,'' attorney John
Wahl, who represented Sipple, said Friday. ``He did some very heroic
things. He was 100 percent disabled from his service in the Marine
Corps, then he went out of his way, endangering his life, to save
the life of President Gerald Ford _ then he got punished for doing
it.''
   Sipple, who was on disability because of mental problems relating
to his combat experiences in the Vietnam War, had originally come to
San Francisco from Detroit so that he could live as he wished
without upsetting his family, according to Wahl. However, that all
changed by the published accounts of his personal life.
   Sipple, though, never regretted his life-saving action, Wahl said.
   ``He just was astounded that some columnist and then the rest of
the media would just take it upon themselves _ without ever asking
him _ to publicize these personal facts about him,'' said Wahl.
   San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen first hinted that
Sipple was homosexual, noting that the White House had not thanked
him for his actions. Ford eventually did convey his gratitude to
Sipple.
   Moore pleaded guilty to the assassination attempt and is serving
a life term in federal prison.
   A Coroner's Office spokesman said Sipple apparently died of
natural causes but results of an autopsy performed Friday were not
immediately available. A statement released by the office said
Sipple had a pacemaker and a long history of hypertension and heart
problems.

   Women in poodle skirts and saddle shoes
and men in T-shirts with rolled-up sleeves danced to Buddy Holly
classics in memory of the rock 'n' roll legend killed 30 years ago
when his plane crashed in this small Iowa town.
   About 2,000 fans gathered at the Surf Ballroom on Friday, braving
snow, high winds and subzero temperatures similar to the conditions
blamed in the Feb. 3, 1959, crash that also claimed the lives of
Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``Big Bopper'' Richardson. The three had
just played the Surf and were en route to Fargo, N.D., in the early
morning hours when the small plane went down.
   ``This old-time music is the only thing that works anymore,''
said Larry Fennigaoh of Milwaukee, decked out in a tuxedo, white
socks and black sneakers.
   Fennigaoh and his wife, Beth, were among those attending a sock
hop at the 11th annual Buddy Holly reunion.
   ``I liked Buddy Holly even better than Elvis (Presley). Elvis had
more persona and was more macho. But Holly had purity, clarity,''
Fennigaoh said.
   Party-goers filed past the Feb. 3, 1959, edition of the Mason
City Globe-Gazette displayed in the ballroom lobby as 1950s and '60s
music blared in the background.
   The newspaper featured six grisly black-and-white pictures of the
wrecked airplane and one-column photos of Holly and Valens.
   Immortalized as ``the day the music died'' in Don McLean's 1972
pop song ``American Pie,'' the plane crash was the first great rock
tragedy.
   Holly, with such hits as ``Peggy Sue,'' ``Rave On,'' ``Not Fade
Away'' and ``It's So Easy,'' was only 22 when he died.
   Valens, 17, already was known for such songs as ``Donna'' and
``La Bamba.'' Richardson, a former disc jockey, had made it big with
the song, ``Chantilly Lace.''
   For more than a decade the faithful have flocked to the ballroom
to honor the man who changed the face of rock 'n' roll with his
inventive lyrics, irresistable melodies and inimitable Texas twang.
   ``My mom grew up with this music and she always played it around
the house. I never got into that loud, banging kind of music,'' said
Tamera ``Tammy'' Kriegel of Grinnell, who wasn't even born in 1959 _
she's 28 _ but has been coming to the Buddy Holly reunion for the
past five years.
   The walls of the 50-year-old ballroom are lined with portraits
and posters of Holly. A 6-foot tombstone etched with the names of
the dead and the words ``Their music lives on'' stands just inside
the entrance.
   Darryl ``Mad Hatter'' Hensley, who organized the annual
observance 11 years ago when he was a disc jockey with KEZV radio,
said more than 2,000 tickets were sold at $45 each for this year's
bash.
   ``I love this stuff,'' said Jan Crowther of Marshalltown, who was
8 years old when Holly died. ``I've been into it since I was
knee-high to nothin'.''
   David Harvey, 32, who has come to the reunion for six years from
his home in London, arrived early Friday afternoon.
   ``I enjoy visiting you colonials, but I'm here to remember Buddy
Holly,'' said Harvey, a railroad conductor. ``Did you know that in
London, Buddy Holly is second in popularity to Elvis Presley?''
   Harvey is one of 14 people from England who attended Friday as
temperatures hovered near 19 below zero and wind chills hit minus 50
degrees.
   Another Briton, Ray Needham, 46, of Upminster, sold memorial
T-shirts for $8 each in a hotel lobby.
   ``I remember the first time I heard him was when `That'll Be The
Day' came on the jukebox. ... The feeling I got from his music was
that his songs were just being sung to me personally,'' said
Needham, co-founder of the British Buddy Holly Society, which he
said claims just under 300 members.

   Johann Hjartarson's offer of a draw after 39 moves
was accepted Friday night by Anatoly Karpov to end game four of the
World Chess Championship quarterfinals.
   With the draw, Karpov, of the Soviet Union, led Iceland's
Hjartarson, 3 to 1. Hjartarson must win the next game, scheduled for
Sunday, to stay alive in the quarterfinals six-game match.
   Grandmaster Joel Benjamin, who attended the game, said Karpov,
playing with white, ``steered into a drawish position early'' and
didn't appear interested in a win.
   He said the game appeared to be a draw most of the way. ``The
game demonstrated that if Karpov wants a draw with white, he can
have it.''
   Both players traded queens in the ninth move, which observers
said virtually assured a draw.
   Karpov, former world chess champion who is ranked second in the
world, has been the clear favorite from the start over Hjartarson,
ranked 11th in the world.
   Both players arrived late at the game site at Lakeside School in
north Seattle, because of snow on the ground and rush-hour traffic.
Nearly 200 people watched the game.

<HEAD>Three Men Charged With Murder in Insurance Scam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founders of an athletic-clothing chain and
a California doctor have been charged with murder in the slaying of
a man whose death authorities say was faked to collect $1.5 million
in insurance.
   Melvin Hanson, co-founder of Just Sweats of Columbus, Ohio, his
partner, John Barrett Hawkins, and Dr. Richard Pryde Boggs of
Glendale, were charged Friday with murder, conspiracy and insurance
fraud.
   The three are accused in the death of Ellis Henry Greene, 32,
whose body was found in Boggs' office last April 16 and was
initially identified as Hanson.
   Boggs told police he believed the body was that of Hanson. He
said the man died after complaining of chest pains and Hawkins had
the body cremated the next day.
   But police later discovered that the thumb print of the corpse
did not match the one on Hanson's California driver's license. The
body subsequently was identified as Greene, a former Ohioan.
   A felony complaint issued by the Los Angeles District Attorney's
office traces the trio's activities over a three-year period. The
scheme allegedly began with Hanson's applications for multiple life
insurance policies in 1986.
   Hanson signed a will in 1987 leaving all his property to Hawkins.
Upon his death, Hanson's will directed that his body be cremated and
that none of his relatives be notified, according to court documents.
   In January 1988, the complaint said, Hanson rented a Miami
condominium using an alias and the next month consulted a plastic
surgeon about changing his appearance.
   Hanson on April 15 flew from Miami to Los Angeles, where he and
Boggs killed Greene the next day, the complaint alleges.
   Hanson left Los Angeles the same day, using the name Wolfgang Von
Snowden, and Hawkins flew to Los Angeles to claim the body
identified as Hanson's.
   Hawkins began filing claims for payments of death benefits on
Hanson two weeks later, according to the court record.
   Hanson underwent cosmetic surgery to disguise his appearance a
month after the slaying, and began using the name and identification
of the victim, Greene, as well as the name Von Snowden. Hawkins went
to Colorado, authorities said, where he used the name Jerry Anthony
Greene.
   Records of telephone calls among Hawkins, Hanson and Boggs dating
to December 1987 helped authorities uncover the alleged conspiracy.
   Hanson was arrested on Jan. 29 at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport by
U.S. Customs agents as he returned from Acapulco, Mexico.
Authorities said he was carrying identification cards under 13 names.
   Hanson appeared in court in Columbus Friday, where he was advised
that he had been charged with theft in the alleged scheme. He was
being held in the Franklin County Jail in lieu of a $5 million bond.
   Hawkins, 25, who collected $1 million in death benefits on
Hanson, remains a fugitive, authorities said.
   Boggs was being held without bail in Los Angeles and his
arraignment was scheduled for Monday afternoon.
   Hanson and Hawkins also are accused of stealing about $2 million
from Just Sweats, which they founded in 1985. The company has filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy
laws.
   Authorities said it was unclear whether the victim was known to
any of the three men and the method by which he was killed has not
been established.

<HEAD>Laurel Appeals To Aquino To Allow Marcos To Die At Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Salvador Laurel said
today that an ailing Ferdinand Marcos may not survive the year and
appealed to President Corazon Aquino to allow her ousted predecessor
to die in his homeland.
   Laurel spoke to reporters after returning from Hawaii, where he
met the 71-year-old former president. He said he was told by doctors
that Marcos' heart, lungs and kidneys were failing and the former
president had lost the will to live.
   There was no immediate comment from Mrs. Aquino, who has refused
to allow her predecessor to return to the Philippines since her
February 1986 ``People Power Revolution'' ended the 20-year Marcos
regime.
   But a Manila newspaper, the Philippine Daily Inquirer, quoted a
Cabinet official as saying the government would refuse even to allow
Marcos to be buried in the Philippines.
   Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno has said Laurel was acting
without Mrs. Aquino's blessing when he went to see Marcos.
   Relations between Mrs. Aquino and Laurel have been strained since
the vice president quit his Cabinet post as foreign minister in 1987
over policy differences. Last August, Laurel formally parted ways
with Mrs. Aquino when he demanded her resignation and announced he
was joining an opposition coalition.
   Laurel said he would try to contact Mrs. Aquino immediately to
ask for an appointment so he could relay to her Marcos's request to
come home. He would also hand Mrs. Aquino a letter from Marcos' son,
Ferdinand Jr., containing the same request.
   Asked if Marcos had offered to return part of the billions of
dollars he allegedly embezzled, Laurel replied he was ``not at
liberty to answer that.'' Later, he told another reporter no offer
was made.
   Laurel said doctors believe Marcos might not survive the trip to
the Philippines but that Marcos told him he ``doesn't mind ... and
he would be happy dying on his way home.''
   ``He told me he has already resigned his fate to Almighty God,''
Laurel said. ``Mr. Marcos expressed to me his desire to die in his
own country.''
   He said Marcos was concerned for the future of his wife, Imelda,
and three children, and added that they also should be allowed to
return.
   Before Laurel's trip, unconfirmed news reports said he and
wealthy Filipino industrialist Enrique Zobel were trying to work out
a deal under which Marcos would return part of his ``hidden wealth''
in exchange for permission to return.
   Asked how he would try to change Mrs. Aquino's mind about banning
Marcos, Laurel said that he ``will invoke the fundamental right of
any Filipino to come home ... I will try to appeal to her sense of
Christian and moral values.''
   Laurel said that his conversation with Marcos was carried on
``intermittently'' because of the former president's poor health.
Last Wednesday Marcos underwent a tracheotomy to clear fluids
building up in his lungs. He has been breathing through a respirator
since then.
   Quoting from a briefing given by doctors, Laurel said Marcos was
running a fever of 103 degrees and weighed less than 100 pounds. He
said doctors told him Marcos' lungs had collapsed twice in three
weeks, his transplanted kidneys were failing and his heart had grown
too weak to pump enough blood.
   The doctors described Marcos' body as ``now destroyed'' and said
``he has less than 10 percent chance of survivial within the year,''
Laurel said.
   Philippine officials have said in the past that Marcos must
return his allegedly embezzled funds and apologize for abuses in his
administration before there could be any discussion of his return.
   In its report, the Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted Cabinet
Secretary Jose de Jesus as saying the government would refuse Marcos
burial in the Philippines because his followers would use the
funeral to undermine Mrs. Aquino.
   Marcos and his wife are under U.S. indictment for allegedly
plundering the Philippines of more than $100 million and stashing
much of the money in the United States.
   A federal judge in New York is to decide this month if Marcos is
healthy enough to stand trial on criminal racketeering charges. Mrs.
Marcos pleaded innocent and is free on $5 million bail.

<HEAD>Cold Stretching from Gulf of Alaska to Gulf of Mexico</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhotos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An Alaskan cold front nearly completed its conquest of the lower
48 states today, putting highways on ice, chilling Mardi Gras
festivities and making weather forecasters the target of some
cabin-fever abuse.
   Frigid air pushed south and east, bringing subzero wind chills to
normally balmy south Texas, coating New York City and Philadelphia
with freezing rain and sending temperatures plunging across Georgia,
Louisiana and Alabama.
   By Sunday, the National Weather Service said, the arctic air is
expected to reach central Florida, completing the southeastward
march that began in Alaska about a week ago.
   Heavy snow fell in the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada, and
temperatures remained well below zero across much of the nation's
midsection. So far, at least 16 deaths around the United States have
been blamed on the cold weather.
   Leo Burnett, a forecaster in the National Weather Service office
in Fargo, N.D., said he and his colleagues were beginning to catch
blame for the painfully cold weather. The high temperature in Fargo
on Friday was 15 below zero, and some people needed a scapegoat.
   ``They're getting a little cabin fever, I guess, and they have to
take their frustrations out on someone, so they call and kind of get
all over the weatherman every once in a while,'' Burnett said.
``We've got thick skins.''
   One man, he said, called to say, ``I'm just in a fit of
depression, and I blame you guys. ... I've got to get out of here.
I'm going to go to Florida.''
   The caller had better move fast. Parts of the Southeast enjoyed
record warmth Friday as they awaited the cold _ it was 77 degrees in
Apalachicola, Fla., breaking the old record for Feb. 3 by a degree.
   Other records included 77 in Ashville, N.C., 75 in Atlanta and 84
in Charleston, S.C.
   But by midnight Friday, it was 49 in Atlanta, and forecasts
called for the temperatures to continue dropping, possibly reaching
into the teens by Tuesday.
   Temperatures dropped 40 degrees in parts of Louisiana, worrying
strawberry farmers and casting a chill _ but not a pall _ over Mardi
Gras festivities.
   ``Snow, sleet, ice or 80 mph winds _ those are the only things
that would stop a parade,' said Assistant Police Chief Ray Holman of
New Orleans. ``Cold weather doesn't dampen many spirits, but it may
cause people to drink more of them.''
   Such parade-stopping conditions aren't likely in New Orleans, but
they provide a fair description of weather across much of the West,
where winter storm warnings were in effect early today in parts of
California, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming.
   In northern California, up to three feet of snow, whipped by
winds of up to 70 mph, fell Friday in parts of the Sierra Nevada and
more was expected today. The Utah Highway Patrol reported ``lots and
lots'' of minor accidents on slick, snowpacked freeways around Salt
Lake City, but ski resort operators were cheering over the extra
foot or more of snow that coated the nearby mountains.
   A Greyhound Trailways bus with 15 people aboard spun around and
overturned Friday on an icy Interstate 70 in Colorado near the Utah
line. Police said 14 people were hospitalized in Grand Junction with
broken bones.
   About 14 Denver high school basketball players and a coach were
treated for possible carbon monoxide poisoning and hypothermia
Friday night when a heater in their chartered bus apparently failed
in bitter cold weather west of Denver. All were treated and released
from two Denver hospitals.
   Subzero cold in Montana caused ice jams on the Bighorn, Missouri
and Clark Fork rivers. The town of Wisdom, Mont., recorded the
nation's lowest temperature of minus 52, and rancher Helen Carey,
who lives about 30 miles south of Helena, said her newborn calves
were losing their ears to frostbite.
   ``Poor little things, they've really had a tough go of it,'' she
said.
   Power outages left people without heat in several places around
the country, including the suburbs of Kansas City, Mo., where a
record low of 7 below zero was recorded at the airport Friday.
   And in Wassau, Wis., sponsors of the Badger State Winter Games
considered calling off this weekend's cross-country ski races
because of subzero cold.

   Vietnam has set up a service to search
for missing relatives and families apart from its ongoing effort to
locate Americans missing in action from the Indochina war, the
Vietnam News Agency said today.
   The official agency said the service would be operated by the
Vietnam Red Cross, which has already held courses in cooperation
with the International Committe of the Red Cross.
   The service would not incorporate the search for American MIAs or
the children of Vietnamese-American parents, the news agency said.
   The report did not say whether the Red Cross would actually
search for remains of those killed in decades of warfare in Vietnam
or just act as a tracing service for families separated by war and
other disasters.

<HEAD>Princess Diana Leaves NYC After Whirlwind Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although her visit to New York was brief,
Britain's Princess Diana seemed to capture the heart of the Big
Apple wherever she went.
   In three days, she saw an opera in Brooklyn, visited a fancy toy
store on Park Avenue and hugged a child with AIDS in a Harlem
hospital.
   The Princess of Wales rubbed elbows with developer Donald Trump,
publisher Malcolm Forbes and actor Michael Douglas.
   Diana also touched the heart of 13-year-old Hope Manley, a
Pennsylvania youngster suffering from cystic fibrosis, and Wanda
Morales, whom the princess visited in a lower East Side shelter for
the homeless.
   On Friday, the last day of her visit, she toured the pediatrics
ward of Harlem Hospital where Diana unexpectedly picked up a
7-year-old afflicted with AIDS after first asking him, ``Are you
heavy?''
   The 27-year-old princess has long sought to educate the public
about the disease, which doctors say cannot be transmitted through
casual contact.
   The princess also attended a briefing by the hospital's
pediatrics director, Dr. Margaret Heagarty, who said later that
Diana was genuinely concerned about the plight of the children and
occasionally interrupted to ask questions.
   At the hospital, hundreds of excited workers strained to catch a
glimpse of the princess. It had been the same throughout her visit
as usually nonplussed New Yorkers sometimes breathlessly recounted a
royal handshake or a wave.
   After her visit to the hospital, Diana attended a private
reception given by British Consul General Gordon Jewkes for about 60
patrons of the Royal Academy of Music.
   After that she left New York as she had arrived, aboard a British
Airways supersonic Concorde.
   Friday's events capped a visit that also included a visit to a
homeless shelter and day-care center and the American debut
performance by the Welsh National Opera at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music.
   Cheering crowds greeted the princess at nearly every stop. The
exception was when about 400 protestors showed up in Brooklyn to
denounce Britain's policies in Northern Ireland.
   But inside the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Diana dazzled the
audience as she entered to a drumroll and the opera patrons fell
silent.
   And later that same evening, New York's social elite again fell
silent as the princess walked down a marble staircase to the dining
area of a gala reception in her honor at the World Financial Center.
   The 800 or so guests remained silent until she approached her
seat at the head table, when they broke into spontaneous applause.
   Her husband, Prince Charles, who stayed in Britian this week,
will arrive in the United States on Feb. 16 for a four-day visit to
Washington and Palm Beach, Fla., where he'll attend charity polo
matches.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Consider Corrections For The Press</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill aimed at compelling newspapers and
broadcasters to publish corrections of errors moved ahead in the
House of Commons, but legislators said it has little chance of final
success.
   The bill, introduced by opposition Labor Party lawmaker Tony
Worthington, proposes a statutory right for members of the public to
correct inaccuracies about them in the news media. Corrections would
have to be given the same prominence as the original mistake.
   Worthington said his Right of Reply bill was needed because of
what he called the ``deterioration in standards of some sections of
the press.''
   He said the bill, which was unopposed Friday in its second
reading, was not an attack on press freedom but an attack on the few
editors and proprietors who abused their power.
   Legislators said the government was neutral about the Right of
Reply Bill, so it would not have any priority on the crowded
parliamentary agenda. They said time was likely to run out before
the bill was examined in committee or in the crucial third reading.
   After being approved by the House of Commons, the bill would then
have to go to the House of Lords.
   Timothy Renton, a Home Office junior minister speaking for the
government, said scandal had been used to sell newspapers for
hundreds of years.
   ``But ... we have a number of reservations about both the
statutory control of the press and about the procedures set forth in
the bill,'' Renton said.
   Labor legislator Ann Clwyd, a journalist, said the bill was
necessary to protect the public from what she called the excesses of
the tabloid press.
   Two other bills dealing with the press failed in the House of
Commons Friday for lack of debating time.
   The Indecent Displays (Newspapers and Workplaces) bill,
introduced by Laborite Clare Short, would have barred newspapers
from publishing ``pictures of naked or partially naked women in
sexually provocative poses.''
   The Protection of Privacy bill, introduced by Conservative
lawmaker John Browne, also failed. It would have given all citizens
a legal right to privacy and compelled newspapers to show their
revelations were ``for the public benefit.''

<HEAD>Reports: Some Foreign Hostages Will Be Released Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weekly magazine said today that two
American hostages will be freed soon, and other publications
reported the imminent release of some of the 15 foreign hostages
held by pro-Iranian extremists.
   The magazine An-Nahar Arab and International said Hezbollah, or
Party of God, has ``decided to release two American captives as a
goodwill gesture.''
   The group, composed of Shiite Moslem fundamentalists loyal to
Iran, is believed to be an umbrella for underground factions that
have claimed the abduction of most of the Westerners missing since
1985.
   The magazine, based in Christian east Beirut, quoted an unnamed
Hezbollah official as saying: ``The scenario is being set for the
release.'' The short report gave no other details.
   The weekly Al-Shiraa reported this week that the case of the
foreign hostages ``has been put on a hot burner.'' While the
magazine gained international fame when it broke the story of secret
U.S. arms sales to Iran in November 1987, subsequent reports on the
hostages have not proved accurate.
   ``This could result in releasing them ... in the light of a
decision to this effect adopted by regional powers interested in
this case,'' Al-Shiraa said without elaboration.
   There are 15 foreign hostages held in Lebanon, including nine
Americans.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.
   The independent daily An-Nahar and the conservative Ad-Diyar
reported today that the release of foreign captives in Lebanon was
part of an agreement mediated by Syria and Iran this week to end a
bloody inter-Shiite power struggle between Hezbollah and the
Syrian-backed mainstream Amal militia.
   ``Informed sources believe that the basic aim of the
Amal-Hezbollah accord is to work on the release of foreign captives
held in Lebanon,'' An-Nahar's terse report said.
   Ad-Diyar, in an equally brief report, quoted an unnamed official
as saying the Amal-Hezbollah accord ``could result in the handing
over of some foreign hostages to the Syrians.''
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. It has some 40,000
troops controlling Moslem areas, including northern and eastern
provinces as well as west and south Beirut.
   The leftist daily As-Safir, which is close to the Syrian army
command in Lebanon, said: ``Diplomatic information speaks of the
possible release of some (foreign) hostages in the next two weeks.''
   The report said the issue ``will be the focus of attention in the
coming days. Recent reports about the possible release of Irish
hostage Brian Keenan were indirect messages to the Americans and the
Britons.'' It did not elaborate.
   Keenan, of Northern Ireland, holds both Irish and British
citizenship.
   A native of Belfast, Keenan was kidnapped April 11, 1986, as he
walked to his teaching job at the American University of Beirut.
   Nabih Berri, leader of Amal, said in Damascus after the agreement
with Hezbollah was signed on Monday, ``The peace pact did not refer
directly to the hostages, but I am sure that this agreement would
help (secure) the release of hostages as quickly as possible.''
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who negotiated on
Iran's behalf during the Damascus talks, said: ``Nobody will be
satisfied with the holding of the hostages, so we do hope that all
the hostages ... will be released.''
   Irish ambassador Patrick McCabe flew in from Baghdad last week to
investigate reports that Keenan, 38, would be freed.
   McCabe, who is ambassador to Lebanon and Iraq, said Wednesday he
hoped the statements by Berri and Velayati would result in the
release of some foreign captives ``before too long.''
   The 15 foreign captives missing in Lebanon are, in addition to
Keenan and the Americans, three Britons, an Italian and a Belgian.

   Two of the quintuplets born last month to their

safety seats, but their siblings could remain hospitalized until
early spring.
   The limousine left Sinai Hospital Friday afternoon with Anthony

ounces and Rebecca, 4 pounds and 2 ounces. The five babies' weights
ranged from 2 pounds, 9 ounces to 3 pounds, 7 ounces at birth.
   Mary Jo Wilson of Auburn Hills delivered the quintuplets about
nine weeks prematurely on Jan. 5. The other three, Shelby, Elizabeth

The Wilsons work at the General Motors Corp. Truck and Bus Plant in

   Figaro the cat is on the market

   Peter Glanfield, a business consultant, said the black-and-white

   ``The elegant feline comes complete with a freehold Victorian

   ``It really is a case of no puss, no purchase,'' real estate

   Residents have begun cleaning up from the
debris and damage left behind by an railroad explosion and fire that
compounded the difficulties of coping with subzero cold.
   As federal officials began an investigation, many people spent
Friday sweeping up glass and assessing the destruction from the
blast, which forced 2,000 people to evacuate their homes in
temperatures of 30 below zero.
   Carroll College's 700 to 800 students remained in temporary
lodgings while hundreds of windows in dormitories and classrooms
were repaired. Classes were canceled until Feb. 13.
   Weather forecasters called for a high today of minus 22.
   The explosion early Thursday shattered windows up to two miles
away and knocked out power to half the city for more than six hours.
It was caused by 21 runaway railroad freight cars that derailed and
crashed.
   Paul Spengler, disaster coordinator for Lewis and Clark County,
said the blast site was being examined by investigators from the
National Transportation Safety Board. The Federal Railroad
Administration also has announced it will conduct a complete
investigation.
   Federal railroad officials had said the initial explosion was
caused when a derailed car hit a propane tank, but that version was
questioned Friday.
   Bill Bradford of Louis Dreyfus Propane Co. in Helena said both of
his company's propane tanks in the area were intact. The propane is
used to heat railroad switches.
   Officials said a rail tank car filled with highly flammable
hydrogen peroxide exploded just before 5 a.m., but a second hydrogen
peroxide car was quickly coated with ice from firefighters' water,
which fire crews believed minimized the danger of it exploding.
   A load of granular plastic inside one of the rail cars smoldered
until it was extinguished Friday afternoon, according to Spengler.
   Only two people were injured in the incident, neither seriously.

<HEAD>Study: Milk Of Canadian Eskimo Women Has Highest PCB Level In World</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The milk of nursing Eskimo women in northern
Quebec has a higher level of PCBs than that of women anywhere in the
world, according to a university study published today.
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, have been linked to cancer
and skin rashes.
   The 1987 study at Laval University in Ste-Foy, Quebec, obtained
by the daily Le Devoir newspaper of Montreal, compared 24 samples of
milk from Eskimo women in northern Quebec to that of 48 women from
southern Quebec, some from an industrial suburb of Quebec City and
the rest from Baie-Comeau on the shore of the lower St. Lawrence
near an aluminum smelter.
   The fat in the milk of the Eskimo women showed an average PCB
concentration of 3.59 parts per million compared to 0.76 for the
rest of the samples, the newspaper said. Some Eskimo women had a
concentration of 14.7.
   Health and Welfare Canada, the federal agency responsible for
health regulations, has set a tolerance level of 1.5 parts per
million.
   Eskimo women in northern Quebec tend to breast feed their babies
for up to 23 months. Their diet for centuries has included large
amounts of fish and animal fat.
   Le Devoir quoted the study as saying an Eskimo child nursed by a
mother whose milk has the average amount of PCB contamination would
have imbibed enough of the toxic chemical within a year to show
observable effects such as skin problems, liver complaints and
problems with their immune system.
   Among women whose milk is highly contaminated, such effects might
appear after four or five months, the newspaper said.
   The authors of the study say the PCBs in the area enter the
environment from industrial waste poured into rivers and coastal
waters and could come from as far away as the Soviet Union.
   Eric Dewailly of Laval University's hospital center, who directed
research for the study, was quoted as telling Le Devoir that fish in
the St. Lawrence river ``are more contaminated than those in the
north.
   ``But we southerners eat a lot less fish than the Inuit
(Eskimo),'' he said.
   The Laval scientists plan to monitor the subjects and their
children for the next year, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>President Premadasa Calls For Peace, Revolution To Eliminate Poverty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa today
called for an end to the discord tearing apart this once idyllic
island and promised a revolution to usher in social change.
   Premadasa presided over austere Independence Day celebrations _
part of a plan to save government funds for an anti-poverty program.
   ``We must terminate ethnic discord,'' he said, so that ``in the
years ahead a new revolution will flourish in every hamlet, village
and town to eliminate poverty, create an equitable social order and
eliminate discrimination.''
   Premadasa, 64, who won the Dec. 19 presidential election and took
over Jan. 2, has vowed to give monthly payments to 1.4 million
families who earn less than the national annual per capita of $360.
   After taking office, he announced a plan to pay poor people $75
monthly for two years, beginning in April. About 7 million of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people stand to gain. The president has not
specified where the funds will come from, though he has urged all
government departments to curb expenses.
   Sri Lanka's independence from Britain in 1948 was commemmorated
today by a 100-member honor guard that presented arms to the
president. Schoolgirls dressed in white sang during the ceremony in
the capital's independence square.
   The traditional military pageant and parade was absent this year,
to save money for Premadasa's anti-poverty program.
   Political analysts, however, insist the major hurdle in the
Premadasa presidency will be to curb ethnic insurgencies that have
torn the island nation apart since 1983.
   Militants from the Tamil minority, claiming discrimination by the
majority Buddhist Sinhalese, have waged a bloody insurgency for an
independent Tamil nation since 1983.
   More than 8,500 people have been killed in the 5-year separatist
insurgency by militants in the Tamil minority.
   Extremists from the Sinhalese majority, angered by the
government's peace overtures to the Tamils, have killed more than
900 people, mostly government supporters, the past 18 months.
   The government says India has begun to withdraw Indian troops
sent here in 1987 to disarm Tamils under terms of a failed peace
pact. The Indian troops are estimated at 44,000.
   Both Tamil and Sinhalese extremists have vowed to violently
disrupt parliamentary elections Feb. 15.
   Speaking in Sinhala, English and Tamil, Premadasa warned,
``Elements who seek to obstruct or destroy the democratic process
will not be tolerated by the vast majority of freedom-loving Sri
Lankans.''
   ``Let us join hands in amity and unity to make our motherland a
land of peace and prosperity,'' he said.
   The Tamils, who are mainly Hindu, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's population. They claim discrimination by the mainly Buddhist
Sinhalese, who are 75 percent of the population and dominate the
government and military.

   A supporter of the Irish Republican Army who
allegedly rushed at the Duchess of York with a flagpole will have
all charges dropped if he stays out of trouble for six months,
authorities said.
   The federal government agreed Friday to defer prosecution against
Michael Shanley, 25, who is accused of attempting to assault the
former Sarah Ferguson, who is the wife of Britain's Prince Andrew.
   Shanley allegedly rushed at the duchess on Jan. 21, 1988, as she
was entering a Manhattan hotel. He was holding a green flag that
read, ``Erin Go Bragh,'' which means ``Ireland forever.''
   He also was accused of assaulting a State Department agent who
wrestled him to the ground.
   The deferral, which came as the duchess' sister-in-law, Britain's
Princess Diana, was visiting New York, means that the charges will
be dropped if Shanley does not violate the law during the six-month
period.
   ``This is as good as an acquittal when it happens,'' said
Shanley's attorney, Stephen Sumerstein. ``This was a false arrest,
in our opinion. ... The charges were all ridiculous.''
   Shanley, a member of the Irish Northern Aid Committee, said in
court Friday that he had followed Sumerstein's advice and not taken
part in a Thursday night demonstration against Princess Diana in
Brooklyn, ``but my heart was there.''

<HEAD>Calm Restored, But Investigation Continues in Drug Suspect's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities are investigating the possibility
that a black man whose death brought about two nights of violence
might have suffocated as he was lying face down and handcuffed in a
police car.
   Edgar Allen Price, 40, of Houston, died following a struggle with
police Wednesday night as eight officers tried to arrest the
6-foot-3, 300-pound drug suspect.
   Dr. Charles Diggs, assistant Hillsborough County medical
examiner, said it appears Price suffocated.
   ``He is working it as an asphyxiated death,'' said April Strouse,
a medical investigator in the medical examiner's office. ``But we
don't know how. We have not been able to determine that yet. There
is a very intense investigation going on.''
   She said doctors hope to have conclusive results by next week.
   Diggs said officials were looking at the possibility that Price
was in the cruiser when his breathing stopped, adding that he had
been deprived of oxygen for some time.
   Price's death triggered violence Wednesday and, to a lesser
extent, Thursday night in College Hill, a poor depressed,
predominantly black neighborhood. One person was arrested Wednesday
night and nine Thursday night.
   There were no disturbances Friday night and police said that no
sections of the area were blocked off.
   The breathing of a person who is intoxicated or stunned, then
placed face down in handcuffs on a seat or car floor, can be
restricted, Diggs said. Price reportedly had alcohol in his blood.
   But Ms. Strouse, who wouldn't confirm whether tests showed Price
had been drinking, cautioned, ``There are a lot of things that can
cause restricted breathing, and we have to wait until we know for
sure.''
   Deputy Chief Thomas DePolis had said Thursday that preliminary
findings showed Price died of a cardiac arrest, but that authorities
had not yet determined what caused Price's heart to stop. The
findings showed police did not choke or beat Price during the
confrontation after an undercover crack cocaine buy, according to
Police Chief Austin McLane.
   Officials, who released the information on Price's death Thursday
in an effort to forestall more trouble, said incidents of rock- and
bottle-throwing were more sporadic and the young people fewer in
number the second night.
   City officials, residents and community leaders continued to
discuss the reasons behind the outbreak, which came less than three
weeks after three nights of unrest in Miami followed the shooting
death of a black motorcyclist. A police officer is charged in that
incident.
   ``This is not Miami, either in scope or in what touched off the
trouble,'' said John Dunn, spokesman for Mayor Sandy Freedman.
``These are teen-agers out there. This was a drug arrest that
sparked it. This was not an indiscriminate action on the part of the
police department.''
   Since an outbreak of violence in 1987 that lasted several days,
Tampa authorities have increased efforts to spruce up housing,
improve economic opportunities, and fight drug use, which they say
is an underlying problem.
   Price, a convicted felon who served 10 years in Texas on a
robbery conviction before being paroled in 1984, was carrying 25
pieces of crack cocaine and a loaded .25-caliber pistol in his
pockets, said Cole.

<HEAD>Bhopal District Judge Orders Court Proceedings In Hindi</HEAD>

   A judge today struck down objections from
Union Carbide and said Hindi, not English, would be the language for
court proceedings on the 1984 gas leak that killed more than 3,300
people.
   ``Our clients do not understand Hindi,'' objected Vijay Gupta,
attorney for the Danbury, Conn.-based company. ``It will be better
if the practice of writing order sheets in English continues.''
   Bhopal District Judge N.K. Jain replied: ``The government's
clients (the gas leak victims) do not understand English.''
   The government of India is suing Union Carbide for $3 billion in
damages for the gas leak that, by the government's count, killed
3,329 people and injured more than 20,000 others.
   Jain said the two sides can argue their cases in English but the
court's order sheet that records the arguments after each hearing
will be prepared in Hindi. Up until now the arguments had been
recorded in English.
   However, he said judgments will be handed down in English.
   India filed the damage suit in 1985, but the case has bogged down
in legal wrangling in a variety of courts.
   Hindi is the official language of India, spoken by more than half
its 880 million people, especially in north and central India, where
Bhopal is located. English also is an official language.
   The Bhopal pesticide plant where the leak of methyl isocyanate
gas occurred is owned by the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide Corp.
   Jain replaced Judge M.W. Deo in the case in Bhopal district judge
after the high court of Madhya Pradesh state ruled last November
that Deo was biased against Union Carbide Corp. A previous judge,
G.S. Patel, was removed for conflict of interest after it was
discovered he was among the 500,000 people who had filed claims in
an attempt to collect compensation.
   Jain set Feb. 18 as the date to fix hearing dates in the suit.

<HEAD>Jumbo Jet Diverted Because Of Fear Of Luggage Tampering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Toronto-bound jumbo jet with 214 people on board
made an emergency landing at Glasgow Airport after a passenger said
she thought someone had tampered with her luggage in the hold,
police and airline officials said today.
   ``It was a false alarm,'' said Glasgow Police Inspector Robert
Nicholson. ``There was a bit of concern, but everything turned out
to have a happy ending.''
   The British Airways jet took off from London's Heathrow Airport
at 4:45 p.m. Friday and had been airborne an hour when a Canadian
passenger told a flight attendant she was worried that her checked
luggage had been tampered with before she boarded a connecting BA
flight in Cairo, the airline said.
   Airline spokesman Bill Burchill said the flight attendant
informed the captain, who decided to turn back and make an emergency
landing.
   The Boeing 747 jet was about 30 minutes over the Atlantic at the
time and had to dump fuel before touching down in Glasgow at 7:45
p.m., he said.
   After the jet landed, inspector Nicholson said all baggage on the
plane was isolated, examined ``and found to be in order.'' The
airline said there were 197 passengers and a crew of 17.
   The plane took off from Glasgow at 9:35 p.m. without the woman
and her two companions, who spent the night at a local hotel to help
police complete their inquiries, Burchill said.
   The woman, who was not identified, and her friends were expected
to fly to Toronto today on a British Airways flight from London, he
said.
   ``The woman felt a certain amount of disquiet,'' Burchill said.
``We have no idea at all why she waited until the plane was
airborne'' to inform the airline of her concern.
   Flight 093 landed safely in Toronto, he said.

<TEXT>
   John Cassavetes, the actor and filmmaker whose
innovative, unconventional movies such as ``A Woman Under the
Influence'' and ``Faces'' drew both disdain and praise, has died at
age 59.
   Cassavetes, who had been in poor health for three years, died
Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of complications resulting
from cirrhosis of the liver, said his publicist, Esme Chandlee.
   At his side was Gena Rowlands, his wife of 30 years and star of
many of his films, including ``A Woman Under the Influence,'' said
Ms. Chandlee.
   ``He was one of the most powerful and original filmmakers who
ever lived. He broke ground in the way films are made,'' said actor
Peter Falk, a close friend who appeared with Cassavetes and Ben
Gazarra in the 1969 film ``Husbands'' about three men drunkenly
facing their own mortality after the death of a friend.
   Cassavetes, one of only four entertainers nominated for Academy
Awards in three categories, was outspoken about the film industry
and never afraid to praise his own work.
   ``I would put my pictures up against anybody's in this world,''
he said in a 1980 interview. ``Certainly in my own day I bow to no
one. I don't think there's another director in the world who works
harder to make better films than I do.''
   Cassavetes was nominated as best writer for his original
screenplay for ``Faces'' in 1968; as best supporting actor in ``The
Dirty Dozen'' in 1967; and as best director for ``A Woman Under the
Influence'' in 1974.
   ``A Woman Under the Influence,'' was his favorite and also his
most critically and commercially successful film. It won Miss
Rowlands a Golden Globe award as best actress and an Academy Award
nomination for best actress.
   As an actor, one of Cassavetes' best-known roles was in
``Rosemary's Baby,'' a 1968 film starring Mia Farrow, in which he
played the husband of a woman who conceives a baby by the devil.
   He also starred with Miss Rowlands, Susan Sarandon and Molly
Ringwald in ``Tempest,'' director Paul Mazursky's film adaptation of
Shakespeare's play.
   Cassavetes made his directorial debut in 1960, when he helmed the
well-received ``Shadows,'' an all-improvised ``cinema verite'' movie
that borrowed heavily from the French New Wave movement and was
produced on a spartan $40,000 budget. The movie was about a
fair-skinned black girl living in New York with her two brothers.
   He then directed two Hollywood films _ ``Too Late Blues'' with
Bobby Darin and ``A Child Is Waiting'' with Judy Garland and Burt
Lancaster. The failures of those films brought him back to being his
own boss, using small film crews and filming on location.
   Cassavetes was born in New York City on Dec. 9, 1929, and grew up
poor. His break in acting came when he played a brooding young
bullfighter in a production of the old ``Omnibus'' TV series in
1953. That led to TV roles in ``Playhouse 90,'' ``Studio One,''
``Kraft Theater'' and ``Climax.''
   He made his movie debut in ``The Night Holds Terror'' in 1955.
   Cassavetes and Miss Rowlands were married in March 1958 and their
careers were seldom separate after that. They had three children:
Nicholas, Alexandra and Zoe.
   Private funeral services were scheduled Monday at Westwood
Memorial Park.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will travel to
China in mid-May to meet Deng Xiaoping in the first summit between
the world's two largest Communist powers since 1959, it was
announced today.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told a news
conference he and Deng agreed that ``Soviet and Chinese leaders will
precede from the presumption of complete normalization of
relations'' between the two countries, putting a formal end to three
decades of enmity.
   Shevardnadze said the two nations also agreed to try to reduce
offensive forces and ease military tensions along their 5,000-mile
border.
   He said his three days in talks in China, including a meeting
with the Chinese leader this morning in Shanghai, had produced broad
agreements on the need for Sino-Soviet efforts to end the 10-year
conflict in Cambodia.
   Shevardnadze left for Islamabad, Pakistan, where he is to confer
today with Pakistan's leaders about the Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan and the prospects for a peace in that nation.
   ``It is our common task now to make sure to contribute to ending
the bloodshed, to contribute to ending the hostilities and to
contribute to the development of dialogue between the Afghans,'' he
said.
   Shevardnadze said he and Deng agreed that the first summit since
Nikita Khrushchev met Mao Tse-tung in Beijing in 1959 will occur
sometime in the middle of May. Soviet sources said the tentative
date was May 15.
   Shevardnadze quoted Deng as saying the summit will ``close the
page on the past and open up a chapter of the future.''
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological and strategic
differences in 1960. They fought a brief border war in 1969 and more
recently have been divided over the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan, Cambodia and their heavily militarized common border.
   China last year agreed to begin talking about a Soviet-proposed
summit after Gorbachev announced plans to withdraw Soviet troops
from Afghanistan and reduce Soviet troop strength in Asia.
   On Friday, China formally invited Gorbachev to visit, and
Shevardnadze accepted on the Soviet leader's behalf.
   The Soviet Union, financial backer of Vietnam, now agrees with
China, supporter of the anti-Vietnamese resistance in Cambodia, on
the need for Vietnam to end its military occupation.
   Shevardnadze said China and the Soviet Union agree on almost all
external aspects _ such as ending arms shipments to the warring
Cambodian factions after a political settlement is reached.
   Shevardnadze said he proposed that diplomatic and military
experts begin drafting an agreement on reducing military forces
along the Sino-Soviet frontier.
   He said the experts could begin meeting before the summit, and
``we hope at the summit we will be able to make progress in that
important direction.''
   The foreign minister said the two sides might initially agree on
advance notice for troop movements and military exercises, and
progress to the more difficult issues of disbanding offensive forces.
   Normalization, the Soviet official said, will extend to
long-severed party ties. He envisioned increased contacts in trade,
science, protection of the environment and exploration of outer
space.
   He said normal ties are directly linked with Soviet
``perestroika,'' or economic restructuring, and Chinese efforts to
modernize its economy.
   Shevardnadze, who flew to Shanghai, 870 miles south of Beijing,
for the meeting with Deng, said China's senior leader was ``a very
wise man who has a lot of rich experience.''
   He earlier held met with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier
Li Peng.

<HEAD>Global Temperature Was Warmest In 1988, 1980s Hotter Than Normal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average global temperature last year was the
warmest of the century, and six of the 20th century's hottest years
have occurred in the 1980s, a British study said.
   Meteorological officials, however, said it was too early to
conclusively blame the greenhouse effect where heat from the sun is
trapped in the atmosphere by gases acting like the glass walls in a
greenhouse.
   ``While a warming of this amount is consistent with the
greenhouse effect caused by the rise in the levels of carbon dioxide
and other man-made gases in the atmosphere, the earth's temperature
fluctuates considerably due to natural causes and no unambigious
connection can yet be made,'' said David Parker, of Britain's
Meterological Office in Bracknell.
   Their work showed that 1988's global average temperature was 57.2
degrees Fahrenheit, 0.5 degrees higher than the 30-year global
average ending in 1979.
   Since 1979, the succession of tiny increases has been too steady
for the weathermen to ignore, Parker said.
   The six warmest years in the century have all been in this
decade, he said. They were 1988, 1987, 1983, 1981, 1980 and 1986, in
descending order of warmth.
   Global temperatures have risen by about 0.8 degrees since the
beginning of the century, Parker said.
   It could take 20 years of temperature rises before the greenhouse
effect could be detected with much certainty, he said in a recent
interview.
   The apparent warming trend was revealed in analyses of global
weather records by the Meteorological Office and the University of
East Anglia in Norwich, southeast England.
   Britain has had a mild winter, with temperatures averaging 5
degrees above the normal temperature of 40 degrees in December and
January. Spring flowers are shooting up and blooming.
   The debate over whether there is a greenhouse effect has been
fueled by unusual weather patterns in recent years, including a
serious drought in the United States last summer.
   Last week, U.S. scientists said they could find no evidence of
any overall temperature increases for the United States from 1895 to
1987.
   But they stressed that the United States makes up only 6 percent
of the earth's surface.

   A reputed Japanese Red Army terrorist who was
convicted of transporting explosives was intending to use them to
blow up a Navy recruiting station in New York City, prosecutors say.
   Government attorneys, charging that Yu Kikumura has ties to a
Libyan-directed terrorist conspiracy, asked a judge Friday to
sentence him to a lengthy prison term.
   However, defense attorneys said the government's pre-sentence
report makes only ``tenuous'' ties between their client and other
terrorist incidents worldwide.
   Kikumura, 36, faces up to 100 years in prison when he is
sentenced Monday.
   In papers filed in U.S. District Court, the government revealed
that Kikumura planned to blow up a Navy recruiting station in New
York City in conjunction with a USO club bombing April 14, 1988, in
Naples, Italy.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito asked Judge Alfred J. Lechner to
help deter terrorism by sending Kikumura to prison ``at least until
he is so old that he is no longer physically capable of building and
planting bombs or assisting with terrorist plots.''
   The Naples blast came on the second anniversary of the U.S. air
strike against Libya and two days after Kikumura was arrested on the
New Jersey Turnpike with three 18-inch pipe bombs in his car.
   Each bomb, manufactured from a fire extinguisher, gunpowder and
lead shot, could destroy an average-size building, authorities said.
   Kikumura, who is alleged to be a member of the terrorist Japanese
Red Army, was arrested last April 12 and convicted Nov. 29 on
charges of illegally transporting explosives, possession of firearms
by an alien, possession of unregistered firearms and carrying false
travel documents.
   Sources have said the government believed other potential targets
may have been the United Nations building or Manhattan's garment
district.
   The pre-sentence report does not mention either site. Alito also
said a map of New York City found in Kikumura's car had marks that
indicated only the recruitment center as the target.
   The Washington Post reported Friday that the government had
evidence proving all three sites were targets of Kikumura.
   Defense attorneys Ronald Kuby and William Kunstler said in their
pre-sentence report that ``the `linkages' it (the prosecution)
attempts to make between Kikumura and others are as tenuous as they
are inflammatory.''

   Authorities might seek the death penalty
against a man accused of fatally stabbing his girlfriend, their two
children and her mother, and then setting their house on fire.
   ``A death penalty count is certainly a possibility with a
multiple killing like this,'' said Lake County Prosecutor Jack
Crawford.
   Dennis Roarke, 25, was charged Friday with four preliminary
counts of murder and was being held without bond.
   Cpl. Steve Ridgley noticed the fire about 6:30 a.m. and tried to
enter the home but was driven back by heat and smoke.
   The bodies were found in the living room after the fire, police
said.
   Autopsies determined the victims died from stab wounds, said Lt.
Robert Seaman.
   The victims were identified as Mary Elizabeth Waggoner, 19; her
two children, 18-month-old Dennis and 3-month-old Mary Ella; and her
mother, Betty J. Waggoner, 61.
   Police said Roarke was hitchhiking in Gary when he was offered a
ride by a truck driver, who told police the man was covered with
blood and had told him he stabbed four people and set fire to their
house.

<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of some of the 259 people who
died on a Pan Am jet that crashed in Scotland are banding together
to criticize the U.S. government for its handling of the tragedy.
   Paul Hudson, a lawyer whose 16-year-old daughter, Melina, died in
the crash, said the families are ``outraged ... at the policy of
utter silence that has apparently been decided upon by the federal
government.''
   Hudson said at least a dozen family members intend to hold a news
conference Monday in New York City to discuss their criticisms. He
said the relatives believe the government should release details of
the crash investigation to them.
   Lynne Fraidowitz, whose son, Daniel Rosenthal, 20, was among the
dead, told The Syracuse Post-Standard that she would press the
government for information until ``I'm satisfied _ we're satisfied _
that we have the truth.''
   ``This is just the beginning,'' she said. ``We're not going to
let a wash go down. If we're not satisfied, we're going to do
something else. ... My son is dead. All I have is a hole in the
ground. I owe my son a reckoning.''
   Among those killed Dec. 21 were 35 students enrolled in Syracuse
University's overseas studies program. In addition to the 259 people
aboard the plane, 11 residents of Lockerbie, Scotland, also were
killed when the jet smashed into a row of houses.
   Investigators have determined that the crash was caused by a bomb
that was smuggled aboard Flight 103 in Frankfurt, West Germany. The
plane later stopped in London and was on its way to New York when
the bomb went off.
   A State Department official declined to comment on the families'
accusations, saying department officials wanted to hear the charges
at the news conference first.
   Meanwhile, a Scottish community worker has announced plans to
establish a scholarship fund that would allow Lockerbie students to
attend Syracuse. Bill Hume said the fund would be a ``living
memorial'' to the victims of the crash.
   Hume, who has arranged support services for residents of
Lockerbie since the crash, said he wants the fund to be taken from
an existing relief fund, the Lockerbie Air Disaster Appeal, which
has already raised $2.2 million.
   ``If the money could be used for something long-lasting, a living
thing where people actually exchange part of their culture and
friendship ... some happiness can come out of it,'' Hume said.

<HEAD>Man Released After 11 Years In Jail Without Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>

   Officials today released a
carpenter who was arrested for communist activities and held for 11
years without trial, an opposition member of Parliament said.
   Cheah Swee Sam was released from the Kamunting detention camp,
120 miles north of the capital, after being held under Malaysia's
Internal Security Act, said Lee Lam Thye, secretary-general of the
opposition Democratic Action Party.
   Lee, in a statement, urged the release of other detainees held
under the act, including opposition parliamentary leader Lim Kit
Siang.
   Cheah, 40, was arrested for communist subversive activities. The
banned Communist Party of Malaysia has 1,500 guerrillas fighting
from the jungles mainly along the Thailand-Malaysia border.
   Lee, who is a member of Parliament, called on the government to
release Lim and Lim's son, Lim Guan Eng, who have been in jail
without trial under the Internal Security Act since October 1987.
   The two, both members of Parliament, are the only remaining
prisoners of 106 political leaders ordered arrested in 1987 by Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who claimed their actions and speeches
were increasing racial tensions between the Malays and Chinese.
   Lee said about 64 people overall are still being held without
trial under the Internal Security Act. About 550 were detained when
Mahathir became prime minister in 1981. Mahathir called for a review
and released most of them.
   In December, Amnesty International criticized the act, which
empowers authorities to order preventive detention without trial for
activities deemed extremely and imminently dangerous to the state
and the public.
   The London-based human rights group said the act fails to state
clear criteria for identifying such activities, and authorities have
not distinguished between violent activities that threaten national
security and non-violent activities that do not involve such a
threat.
   Amnesty requested a review of the security act. Malaysian laws
are ``seriously inadequate'' to safeguard against arbitrary arrest,
detention without trial, torture or other degrading treatment, it
said.

<HEAD>Radical Alliance Vows To Disrupt Hirohito Funeral</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several ultraleftist groups have formed an alliance
aimed at disrupting the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, a radical
leader said today.
   Yoshihisa Fujiwara said in an interview that his group ``is in a
common front'' with three other major ultraleftist organizations.
   Speaking with The Associated Press at the heavily fortified
headquarters of his Middle Core Faction, he said the alliance is
planning guerrilla activities to disrupt Hirohito's funeral on Feb.
24.
   He said the alliance includes the Revolutionary Workers'
Association, a group of revolutionaries linked by police to more
than a dozen incidents since Hirohito's health deteriorated in
September. Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7.
   Police believe the Middle Core Faction and the Revolutionary
Workers' Association, are Japan's largest ultraleftist groups.
Police say the Marxist-Leninist faction has between 3,000 and 5,000
members, while the Revolutionary Workers' Association has hundreds
of members.
   Fujiwara said the other two groups in the front are the Battle
Flag Faction and the Insurrection Faction.
   Police estimate the Battle Flag Faction membership to be in the
hundreds but are unclear about size of the Insurrection Faction.
Fujiwara refused to estimate the size of any of the groups,
including his own.
   At least half a dozen radical groups have threatened to disrupt
Hirohito's funeral, which will be attended by dignitaries from over
130 nations, including President Bush and Prince Philip of Britain.
More than 30,000 police will be mobilized to ensure their safety.
   Ultraleftists claim the monarchy supports Japanese imperialism,
and they are protesting the state funeral because they say Hirohito
should be treated as a war criminal for his role in World War II.
   Fujiwara, who described himself as a ``ranking member'' of the
Middle Core Faction, refused to say whether Bush is being singled
out as a target but said the American leader's attendance at the
funeral ``is inexcusable.''
   The faction, seen by police as a serious threat to funeral
security, is believed to have the capability of firing missiles more
than 2{ miles.
   After the 1986 Tokyo summit of industrialized nations, it claimed
responsibility for launching missiles that overshot a state guest
house where Western leaders were meeting. ``It is natural to assume
that our technology has improved since then,'' Fujiwara said. He
refused to elaborate.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, through
a visit by Vice President Dan Quayle, is putting El Salvador on
notice that it must curb human rights abuses or face potential loss
of U.S. aid.
   Quayle also signaled Friday a U.S. willingness to back
postponement of upcoming Salvadoran elections if President Jose
Napoleon Duarte feels he has a consensus mandate to do so.
   Wrapping up the Bush administration's first overseas diplomacy
trip, Quayle made a strong appeal for human rights in El Salvador.
   In a private meeting with top military leaders, he used direct
language reminiscent of a similar mission in 1983 by then Vice
President George Bush, according to officials who attended. Bush had
told the Salvadorans to improve their human rights record or face
loss of further aid.
   ``Quayle was very emphatic in describing the bipartisan
consensus'' in Washington that has led to $3 billion in U.S. aid to
El Salvador during this decade, said one State Department official.
   Quayle explained that the consensus ``is of necessity a very
fragile thing, and that sliding back on the human rights questions
would threaten it.'' The vice president tried ``to tell them the
facts of life in Washington,'' the official said.
   Quayle also met in San Salvador with the two leading candidates
to succeed Duarte as president, and with labor and business leaders,
as well as Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Dama.
   Stopping in El Salvador after two days in Venezuela for that
country's presidential inauguration, Quayle had lunch with Duarte
and several government officials. He offered a toast in which he
praised Duarte as a champion of human rights and repeatedly stressed
U.S. commitment to that cause.
   ``Why I am here today is to reiterate in the strongest terms
possible our commitment to democracy and the advancement of human
rights,'' Quayle told reporters in a news conference later. ``There
are consequences to human rights violations in the future.''
   U.S. commitment and support for El Salvador, he said, ``is
conditioned on advancing democracy and human rights.''
   Human rights abuses, including killing of civilians by right-wing
death squads, were rampant in El Salvador in the early 1980s. The
situation calmed down considerably after 1984, but in the past year
violence by both left and right-wing factions has picked up again.
   Quayle arrived amid tight security at a time when the wartorn
Central American nation is preparing for its March 19 presidential
election.
   The rebels' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN,
proposed in a peace plan Jan. 23 to postpone the election until
September.
   In the strongest U.S. statement to date on the peace proposal,
Quayle called it ``a step forward.''
   The rebels for the first time ever are offering to participate in
the elections if certain conditions are met, including the
postponement.
   Quayle said ``I'm sure there would be strong support from the
administration'' should Duarte decide he has a national consensus to
agree to the postponement.

   North Korea accused South Korea of committing a
military provocation today by sending four warships into the North's
territorial waters.
   The North's official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in
Tokyo, said the ships sailed deep into its waters off North Korea's
western coast before turning south when a North Korean patrol boat
approached.
   The report did not say whether any shots were fired.
   It was the third reported incident between the two nations in
eight days.
   A North Korean patrol boat seized two South Korean fishing boats
in the Yellow Sea on Jan. 28. On Friday, the North said South Korean
troops fired on a North Korean guard post in the demilitarized zone
separating the countries.
   The North Korean news agency said the alleged warship intrusion
was a ``premeditated and deliberate military provocation aimed at
pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of
strain.''
   South Korea ``must immediately desist from all ... hostile acts
aggravating the situation, which runs counter to the Korean people's
desire for reunification and to the global trend toward universal
detente,'' it said.
   Another agency report today said North Korea would send five
delegates to the truce village of Panmunjom on Wednesday for
negotiations with South Korea over arrangements for talks between
the nations.
   The Koreas have agreed to talks between their prime ministers on
easing military tension and achieving reunification of the divided
peninsula. Such high-level talks have not been held since the
1950-53 Korean War.
   Korea was divided into the communist North and the capitalist
South in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's 35-year
colonial rule over Korea. The two Koreas now are involved in their
widest-ranging contacts since the war.
   Earlier today, the South Korean government said an unprecedented
economic agreement reached last week between South Korea's largest
business group and North Korea ``could contribute to efforts to
achieve national unification.''
   The Seoul government said it will propose special legislation to
carry out the agreement between Hyundai and a state-run North Korean
corporation to develop a tourist resort, a shipyard and a railroad
plant in the North.
   Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai
group, visited North Korea Jan. 23 to Feb. 1 to discuss the proposed
joint venture.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper said about 40 million people
were arrested, executed or otherwise repressed under Josef Stalin,
and it gave the most detailed breakdown of his victims ever reported
in the official press.
   The tabloid's figures indicate up to 15 million of those people
died as a result of the dictator's policies. Western historians, who
also include estimates of farmers believed to have died after they
were forced from their land, put the number at 20 million.
   About 20 million Soviets are estimated to have died in World War
II.
   The figures were not new for Western readers, but their
appearance in this week's Arguments and Facts, whose circulation is
20 million, marked a new attempt to fill in what Soviets call
``blank spots'' in their history.
   Historian Roy Medvedev gave the 40 million figure in an interview
with the newspaper and said it included all ``victims of
Stalinism.'' He said he based the number on his own calculations of
the number arrested, executed and otherwise punished.
   The figure is much higher than the vague estimate previously on
the official record. Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in a
November 1987 speech that ``many thousands of people ... were
subjected to wholesale repressive measures'' under Stalin.
   Western historians believe that about 20 million Soviets died
under Stalin, who ruled from 1924-1953.
   In the new report, the Soviet historian wrote that 6-7 million
were killed in the famine of the early 1930s, 5-7 million were
executed or died in labor camps during mass arrests in the late
1930s, and 1 million died in forced relocations of ethnic minorities
during World War II.
   Also today, the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya reported that a mass
grave had been discovered in Gorno-Altai, 1,900 miles southeast of
Moscow. It said construction workers found the human remains,
including 50 skulls of men ages 30 to 50 who were shot in the head.
   The report said a Stalin-era prison camp had been located in the
region and that authorities could not yet guess at how many people
were buried there.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya suggested the mass gravesite was similar to
one found last year in Kuropaty, an area of the Byelorussian
republic. Authorities say Kuropaty was used as a graveyard for at
least 30,000 people killed from 1937 to 1941 under Stalin,
apparently for political reasons.
   In the Arguments and Facts article, Medvedev gave this breakdown
for Stalin's victims:
   _From 1927-1929, about 1 million Soviets, mostly former members
of political opposition groups and figures in Soviet founder
Vladimir I. Lenin's New Economic Policy, were in jails or exile.
   _From 1930-1932, nine to 11 million peasants were deported to
Siberia and other remote regions or fled to cities. At least 1
million more peasants were deported in 1933.
   _From 1932-1933, 6 million to 7 million people died in a famine
blamed on Stalin's agricultural policies.
   _About 1.5 million to 2 million other peasants were arrested for
violating various ``extremely cruel'' laws on state property.
   _In 1935, 1 million former officials, merchants and nobelmen were
branded ``class strangers'' and deported from Leningrad, Moscow and
other cities.
   _During 1937-1938, 5 million to 7 million people were arrested in
the ``Great Terror.'' Of them, 1 million were sentenced to death and
the rest sent to labor camps, where most died.
   _Mass repressions struck 1 million people from 1939-1941 in the
Baltic republics and the western sections of the Ukraine and
Byelorussia.
   _During World War II, up to 2 million ethnic Germans were
deported. About 3 million Moslems were forced to move. One million
of those deported died.
   _After 1940, 2 million to 3 million people were arrested for
reporting late to work, a crime punishable by up to five years in a
labor camp.
   _From 10 million to 12 million Soviets were deprived of certain
rights or sent to labor camps because they lived in areas the Nazis
occupied during the war.
   _After the war, from 1946 to 1953, from 1 million to 1.5 million
people were arrested for political reasons.
   Medvedev was expelled from the Communist Party in 1969, and his
major works on Stalin's repression and other topics were banned from
publication. Under Gorbachev policy of glasnost or more openness,
Medvedev is back in favor and has been quoted frequently in the
official press.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Says Afghanistan Pullout to End In Four Days</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs at the end with Vorontsov discounting rumors of

   Soviet troops will complete their
withdrawal from Afghanistan in four days, a senior Soviet official
was quoted as saying today.
   ``As promised, the Soviet Union is evacuating its troops from
Afghanistan. Within four days, there will be no Soviet forces in
Afghanistan,'' Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov was
quoted as saying by Iran's official Tehran Radio.
   Voronstov, who also is the Kremlin's ambassador to Kabul, spoke
after he arrived in Tehran. The broadcast was monitored in Nicosia.
   Under an accord signed last year in Geneva, all Soviet troops are
due to be out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15. Vorontsov's remarks
indicated the Kremlin wanted the pullout completed ahead of the
deadline.
   The radio said Vorontsov would discuss with Iranian officials and
Afghan resistance leaders the future of Afghanistan after the Red
Army's evacuation.
   Vorontsov said, ``At this juncture, it is necessary to discuss
ways of positive reconstruction of that country. It is necessary
that its neighbors exchange views on the future of Afghanistan.''
   ``But of course the future of Afghanistan concerns only the
Afghan people,'' he stressed.
   The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up its
Marxist government. At one point the Soviets had about 115,000
troops there.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Nicosia, quoted Vorontsov today as discounting reports of a possible
military coup by hard-line Afghan officers after the Soviet pullout.
   ``There are numerous rumors about Afghanistan, but there is no
such possibility and it is thoroughly baseless,'' he was quoted as
saying.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed two Palestinian
teen-agers today during clashes with stone-throwers in a refugee
camp in the occupied Gaza Strip, the military said.
   At least 23 Palestinians and a Swiss Red Cross worker were shot
and wounded in riots in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, an Arab
reporter and hospital officials said. The army said only 16 were
wounded.
   The dead boys were identified as 15-year-old Allah Abdullah
Arandez and 16-year-old Maged Jawdat Ihlak. The Arab reporter said
both were shot in the chest during protests in the Khan Younis
refugee camp.
   Since the uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied lands
began 14 months ago, 373 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been
killed.
   A military official confirmed today's deaths, but said Arandez
was 24 and not 15 as reported by the hospital.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
troops were forced to fire after a group of women and masked youths
surrounded their lookout point in the refugee camp and threw rocks.
The incident was under investigation, the official said.
   Arandez's family took his body from the camp hospital and quickly
arranged a funeral, which was followed by a protest march through
the camp.
   Arandez was the second member of his family to be killed in the
uprising, Arab reporters said. His brother, 26-year-old Sabri
Abdullah, was shot and killed in November, they said.
   In the clashes with troops that followed the funeral, 20
Palestinians were shot and wounded, including Ihlak, who died in the
operating room, said refugee camp hospital officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The wounded also included four teen-age girls and a 25-year-old
man who was in critical condition, the officials said.
   Alexander Antonin, a Swiss Red Cross worker, was shot in the leg
after arriving at the Khan Younis camp to help arrange the
evacuation of wounded, said Frederick Maurice, head of the
International Committee of the Red Cross in Israel and the occupied
areas.
   Antonin had followed ambulances into the camp and was negotiating
with troops about evacuations when more riots broke out, Maurice
said.
   ``He was in between the soldiers and the protesters. ... There
was also tear gas, and it was very difficult to see what was going
on. There was stone throwing on one side of the street and shooting
on the other,'' Maurice said. ``It was a bit of a mess.'' He said
the Red Cross has not decided whether to file a complaint with the
Israeli army.
   ``It's possible an accident happened,'' he said.
   The army imposed a curfew on the camp and ordered all 35,000
residents to remain at home, an Arab reporter said.
   In other clashes, four Palestinians were wounded in the Dir El
Balah and Rafah refugee camps in the Gaza Strip and in the occupied
West Bank town of Kalkilya, hospital officials said.

<TEXT>
   A judge has refused to block distribution of
Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko's article calling political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche a cat killer.
   ``The court does not believe the speech _ although it may be
inappropriate and nasty _ constitutes `fighting words,''' Cook
County Circuit Judge Thomas O'Brien said Friday.
   The column, syndicated through the newspaper, claims LaRouche
followers have killed their opponents' cats _ a claim LaRouche
followers deny.
   ``I hope that this column finds its way to his fellow inmates,''
Royko wrote in the column, which is distributed to about 500
newspapers. ``They should know that they have a cat killer in their
midst. And I hope any cat lovers among them do whatever they feel is
appropriate.''
   LaRouche attorneys had sought to block distribution of the
column, contending it was written to ``urge or incite Mr. LaRouche's
fellow inmates to do physical harm to him.''
   LaRouche, 66, was convicted Dec. 16 of conspiracy to commit mail
fraud involving defaulted loans; 11 counts of actual mail fraud
involving defaulted loans; and one count of conspiring to defraud
the Internal Revenue Service.
   He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

   Authorities are circulating a sketch of a thief
who swiped a judge's custom robe from the county courthouse during a
recess.
   ``At first, I thought someone was playing a prank on me,'' said
Montgomery County Superior Court Judge Thomas W. Ross.
``Unfortunately, the robe was given to me as a Christmas present by
my wife. My name was monogrammed in the back.''
   Sheriff's deputies say they believe the would-be jurist was a man
who asked a clerk for directions to Ross' courtroom during the
recess.
   The $150 black robe was taken Jan. 25 as Ross lunched with the
sheriff, district attorney and other court personnel. He last saw it
hanging in a lounge between the courtroom and the judge's chambers.
   Two other judges' robes hanging nearby were not taken.
   ``It was one of the better-looking robes,'' said sheriff's Capt.
Richard Russell.
   The judge, who now wears a spare robe, takes the robe-napping in
stride.
   ``It could have been worse,'' he said. ``Someone could have put a
hole through it while I was wearing it.''

<HEAD>Japanese Tackling Task of Leisure Time</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan faces a grim task that may prove more vexing
than flooding the world with cars or cracking the computer chip
market: having a good time.
   Although older Japanese cling to the work ethic that rocketed
this country from World War II devastation to economic superpower
status, their children have decided all work and no play made Japan
a dull nation.
   Shoko Shima, 31, works 45 hours a week as a translator, about
average for the Japanese.
   But she also takes time to work out regularly at a health club
and play tennis and golf. ``People used to work for work's sake or
their family's sake. But now many of us work to have free time,''
Ms. Shima said.
   ``More and more young people are choosing part-time jobs so they
can work when they want instead of being tied to a big company.''
   In some ways, Japan today is a nation bent on enjoying itself:
the number of official holidays surpasses that of the United States,
and young people's vision of the future does not include working
grueling hours and blind loyalty to a company.
   ``Many people today say their hobby is work, and the older ones
especially say it with a sense of pride,'' said Sumiko Iwao, a
psychologist who teaches at Tokyo's Keio University. ``But younger
people today are saying `No, that's not my cup of tea.' ''
   ``In the future, productivity will decline, but that's not bad
because it is much better for Japanese to enjoy life and relax than
just work all the time,'' Ms. Iwao said.
   But the old ways continue, especially in the highly charged
business world.
   ``If you want to succeed in business in Japan, you still have to
work from 9 to 9,'' Ms. Shima said.
   The average Japanese worked 2,150 hours in 1986 _ about 225 hours
more than Americans and almost 500 more than West Germans, according
to Labor Ministry statistics. In 1987, the Japanese figure edged up
by 18 hours.
   The government embraced the idea of a five-day workweek in 1985,
partly to reduce big trade surpluses. More leisure time, the theory
goes, would equal increased spending on imports, an expansion of
recreational industry, more domestic spending.
   But no one said it would be easy.
   Office worker Kayoko Kumagai, 41, divides her free time between
household chores, bowling and working out at her health club. But
her 37-year-old husband, a company worker, ``just lies around the
house'' on his one day off a week, she said.
   Like most Japanese, Kumagai has grown used to working six days a
week with only Sundays off.
   ``Not many people realize they are working too much. They take it
for granted,'' said Mrs. Kumagai. She counts her husband among them,
and added, ``My husband wouldn't be able to figure out what to do if
he had weekends off.''
   When the government announced plans to give about 58 percent of
public servants two Saturdays off a month, people complained they
could no longer pay taxes, apply for travel visas or visit the
national library every Saturday. The so-called ``twin holidays''
went into effect Jan. 14.
   Financial institutions went to a five-day workweek Feb. 1, and
the government hopes other businesses will follow suit. It has
targeted 1993 for a uniform five-day workweek.
   Meanwhile, Japan is creating more leisure time by expanding the
number of official holidays from 12 in 1988 to 13 this year, well
ahead of the 10 holidays a year enjoyed by some Americans.
   ``The Japanese find `vacant time' excruciatingly difficult, and
come nowhere near enjoying its advantages,'' wrote former government
official Taichi Sakaiya in the daily Japan Times.
   Japanese tend to hustle even on vacation, Sakaiya noted: ``An
overwhelming number of Japanese prefer the quickie type of package
tour such as five European cities in eight days.''
   Today, sports, travel and relaxing at home with videos, stereos
and computers are the most common ways Japanese spend their leisure
time, a change from a few years ago when the majority in a survey
said sleeping was their favorite pastime away from work.

   Azaldin, a schoolteacher from the
eastern city of Ghazni, says he doesn't care who rules his ravaged
country, as long as the fighting stops.
   He is typical of many Afghans who have braved a decade of brutal
fighting between communist forces and Moslem rebels called
mujahedeen.
   Mujahedeen leaders, the seven most powerful of whom are based in
Peshawar, Pakistan, are fighting for an Islamic republic of
Afghanistan but so far have failed to agree on how to slice any
postwar political pie.
   ``They have had no unity,'' said Azaldin, 37, who uses just one
name. ``Each of them wants power. But seven kings or presidents in
Afghanistan is impossible.''
   Fazle Mohammad, an elderly merchant who sells spices and grain
from a grimy adobe shop in this small settlement, says he doesn't
know one guerrilla chief from another.
   ``We don't know much about them. We follow the local mujahedeen
commanders,'' he said.
   Fazle said his sympathy for the guerrillas forced him to abandon
his original shop in the communist-held center of Ghazni, about 75
miles southwest of the Afghan capital.
   With the Feb. 15 deadline for the final Soviet troop withdrawal
from Afghanistan drawing near, mujahedeen political leaders have
been trying to reach a political consensus.
   They have tentative plans for a Feb. 10 ``shura,'' or
consultative council to convene in Pakistan, but its composition
remains uncertain.
   Invitees include representatives of rebels based in Iran. These
guerrillas belong to the Shiite Moslem sect, which comprises about
17 percent of Afghanistan's population.
   The majority of Afghans are Sunnis, as are the Pakistan-based
rebel groups. Both sides have yet to agree on their proportional
representation in the council.
   The shura's main task is to name a transitional government that
can step into power if the guerrillas topple the ruling People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   Mohammad Zai, a 78-year-old former farmer who now runs errands
for the guerrillas, says that for him, politics plays second to
peace.
   ``For me, it's not a problem of who it is who leads Afghanistan,
as long as the people like him and choose him,'' Zai said.
   Fazle said that if individual guerrilla leaders make a grab for
power after the Soviet withdrawal, they will get little support from
battle-weary Afghans.
   ``We just want an Islamic government,'' he said. ``We didn't
fight for anybody but God, Islam and our country. Even our small
children understand this.''

<HEAD>Some Link Paraguay's New Leader With Drug Traffickers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with diplomatic and political sources
alluding to reports of drug ties, difficulties for new leader; no pickup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Diplomatic and political sources have
linked the new president, Gen. Andres Rodriguez, with drug
traffickers and cast doubt on his pledge to lead Paraguay into a new
era of democracy.
   Rodriguez, who led the bloody coup that ousted President Alfredo
Stroessner on Thursday, was sworn in as president Friday.
   Rodriguez, who held the No. 2 position in the military and was
considered a strong Stroessner ally, immediately promised democratic
reforms and more human rights protections, but he failed to provide
details.
   The coup leader had no comment today on Stroessner's fate. On
Thursday, he gave the 76-year-old Stroessner 12 hours to leave
Paraguay, a deadline that apparently passed unenforced. He
apparently remained under house arrest.
   ``The new president finds himself in a very difficult situation''
because of his professional and personal ties to Stroessner, an
opposition political leader said today. Rodriguez's daughter is
married to Stroessner's son, and the generals share two
grandchildren.
   ``Aside from the strictly political question, this involves
family ties,'' the leader said on condition of anonymity.
   Up to 200 soldiers, mostly Stroessner loyalists, were killed in
battles with Rodriguez's troops beginning Thursday night, according
to estimates from Roman Catholic Radio Caritas. The government and
hospital officials have refused to comment on the death toll.
   By Friday afternoon, Stroessner, Paraguay's president and army
commander-in-chief for 34 years, was under arrest, Rodriguez was
sworn as the new president, the armed forces proclaimed loyalty to
him, and the population was quiet. Not even the staunchly
pro-Stroessner wing of the ruling Colorado Party rallied to
Stroessner's side.
   In addition to Stroessner, about 30 of his followers were
arrested. There was no word of their fate today.
   Unconfirmed reports said Friday that Stroessner was going to
Chile. Gen. Mario Mardones, Santiago police commander, said he
believed Stroessner was leaving Paraguay today, ``but we do not know
where to. Not necessarily Chile.''
   Rodriguez initially was enthusiastically endorsed by opposition
leaders who hoped he would offer them a political opening that
Stroessner and the militant wing of his party did not.
   But academics, foreign observers, and even some Paraguayan
leaders already are hinting at a dark side of Rodriguez.
   ``He has an exceedingly unsavory reputation,'' John Hoyt
Williams, a professor of Latin American history at Indiana State
University in Terre Haute, Ind., told the New York Times.
   ``I mean really bad, and that's an understatement .... Rodriguez
reportedly has provided protection, air fields and an air taxi
service to people smuggling drugs northward,'' Williams said.
   The Cox newspaper group, citing a classified U.S. State
Department report, said on Friday that Rodriguez is considered by
law enforcement authorities in Paraguay to be the country's No. 1
drug trafficker.
   A Western diplomat in Asuncion, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said today that reports are common in Paraguay that
Rodriguez allows cocaine traffickers to use an airstrip he owns in
deserted Chaco Province along the border with Bolivia.
   However, he added, ``Absolutely no proof of that has ever been
offered.''
   Rodriguez, the son of a small-scale farmer, definitely lives
better than his army salary would seem to allow. His house in a
plush neighborhood is a mansion with a fountain in the
well-manicured front yard.
   In his biography, ``Paraguay Under Stroessner,'' U.S. academic
Paul Lewis said Rodriguez made his fortune from the whisky and
cigarette concessions in the early 1960s. It claims he later turned
bigger profits by allowing his extensive property near Asuncion to
be used for drug-trafficking airstrips.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about U.S. reports
of Rodriquez's alleged drug ties, told reporters, ``We won't
characterize our relationship to him at this point.''
   However, Paraguay's new leader has vowed to press for democracy
and ``respect the human rights of everyone to make democracy a
reality.''
   Several thousand citizens cheered Rodriguez, five rows of medals
on his shirtfront, as he took the oath of office in the 19th century
National Palace.
   But Rodriguez, commander of the powerful First Army Corps, said
nothing about elections nor how long his presidency would last.
   The coup was provoked when Stroessner, who has been reported in
poor health since prostate surgery five months ago, tried to force
Rodriguez into retirement. The dictator's recent shakeups of the
army also caused widespread resentment among his officers.
   Stroessner, who took power by coup in 1954, tortured and killed
opponents during his early years in power, human rights groups said.
Others were jailed indefinitely, convicted of political crimes or
forced into exile. The U.S. government labeled his government a
dictatorship in 1986.
   Under his rule, Paraguay became a haven for fugitive Nazis, drug
traffickers and former dictators. Among the refugees were Josef
Mengele, the doctor at the Auschwitz death camp, and ousted
President Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua.

<HEAD>North Trial Judge Called Stern, Smart, Fair, Not Lacking In Confidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Well before Oliver L. North's trial got under
way in Courtroom 6, Judge Gerhard A. Gesell asked how long it would
last, telling lawyers ``far more important matters'' awaited his
attention.
   Sparring from the bench with defense lawyers and prosecutors
alike, the energetic 78-year-old federal district judge obviously
relishes the limelight and legal challenges posed by the first
criminal trial in the Iran-Contra affair.
   But despite the national attention given the case, Gesell took
pains at the Jan. 9 hearing to remind the lawyers that he will treat
it like just another criminal matter on his crowded docket.
   ``It has become increasingly urgent for me to know how long this
case is going to take,'' Gesell said at the hearing. ``There are a
substantial number of litigants with _ I think _ far more important
matters pending who want to be heard.
   ``I've got all kinds of problems in terms of the work of the
court as an institution,'' said Gesell, who unlike most judges his
age has refused to take a reduced caseload by going on ``senior
status.''
   Told the trial could last four or five months, Gesell replied,
``It will be a wonderful summer.''
   Highly regarded for his intellect and ability to conduct a
difficult trial, Gesell is known among Washington lawyers as being
impatient with slipshod pleadings and arguments.
   ``You better be prepared, but he gives you a fair hearing on
everything,'' said attorney James Jordan, a former bar association
president who has tried a number of civil cases before Gesell.
   Others note a touch of intellectual arrogance in Gesell, the son
of a noted Yale University child psychologist.
   ``Sometimes wrong, never in doubt,'' said one attorney, echoing _
on condition of anonymity _ a sentiment expressed by other
colleagues in the local bar. ``He does a lot of thinking out loud, a
sign of self-confidence of which he is not lacking.''
   Gesell's habit of expressing his thoughts from the bench has sent
many a reporter scurrying to the telephone with excited accounts
about the judge's latest doubts about the future of the Iran-Contra
case.
   At the outset of jury selection, Gesell said the difficulty
finding prospective jurors who had no knowledge of North's immunized
congressional testimony raised questions about ``the triability of
the case.''
   Yet after five days, the judge managed to find 32 prospective
jurors for a planned pool of 50, from which the panel will be
selected.
   Gesell can also be hot tempered as he was when he threatened an
ABC News reporter with a contempt-of-court citation for airing an
account of jury selection that he said ``appears to be a deliberate
effort'' to disrupt the process.
   The judge's storm of vituperation quickly passed and there has
been no further mention of contempt proceedings against the
television reporter, Tim O'Brien.
   Gesell's experience with big cases and troubling issues
throughout his 20-year career on the bench no doubt figured in the
decision by Aubrey E. Robinson Jr., the chief judge of U.S. District
Court here, to assign the Iran-Contra cases to him.
   Throughout the pre-trial maneuverings several judges expressed
the view that if any jurist could bring the difficult case to trial
it would be Gesell.
   ``He is just very much in control,'' said William Jeffress, a
criminal defense lawyer who clerked for Gesell in the early 1970s.
``I would certainly say he has a dominating personality. He is and
remains in control of what goes on in his court.''
   Gesell has had his share of other famous cases, notably the
Watergate plumbers case in 1974, which involved the conspiracy to
break into the office of a Los Angeles psychiatrist to get the
patient records of Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers
to The New York Times.
   Gesell refused in 1971 to enjoin The Washington Post from
publishing its version of the secret Pentagon study of the Vietnam
War.
   He was the only federal judge who refused to grant the Justice
Department's requests for injunctions to delay newpaper publication
of the Pentagon Papers _ a position vindicated by a unanimous
Supreme Court decision in the case.
   A year earlier, Gesell had enjoined the Government Printing
Office from publishing a House Internal Security Committee report
listing 65 ``radical revolutionary'' campus speakers. The judge
found it had served no ``legislative purpose and was issued solely
for exposure for intimidation.''
   After attending Yale as an undergraduate and law student, Gesell
came to Washington during the New Deal and went to work at the
Securities and Exchange Commission for William O. Douglas, who later
became a Supreme Court justice.
   At the SEC, Gesell successfully investigated a major Wall Street
investment scandal _ an episode Douglas cites in his memoirs. Later,
Gesell became a partner for the celebrated Washington law firm of
Covington and Burling, making his mark as an anti-trust lawyer.
   With his rosy cheeks, the white-haired jurist was once aptly
described by The New York Times as resembling a clean-shaven Santa
Claus. Known among friends as a jovial raconteur, Gesell usually
spends the month of August at his summer home on an island off the
cost of Maine.
   On most weekends, he and his wife, Peggy, go to their dairy farm
near Leesburg, Va., where he produces his own brand of honey that is
sold in local stores and vegetable stands.
   Jeffress said Gesell is not just a ``gentleman farmer who goes
out and gets waited on, but a farmer who gets his feet dirty.''

   When House Speaker Jim Wright sent out a
questionnaire on the pay raise issue to his colleagues last week,
one came back with a cryptic note: ``Sam Rayburn would not have sent
out a survey like this.''
   The reference to fellow Texan Rayburn, considered among the
strongest House speakers in the century, was a pointed jab at Wright
for failing to take command on the controversial issue and instead
attempting to spread the blame by seeking the opinions of his
colleagues.
   ``There were four who wrote on the survey something to the effect
that `This is a bum idea,''' Wright conceded to reporters as he
handed out the results of his poll last week. But he contended many
more members were glad to be consulted on how to handle the
recommended 51 percent pay hike.
   Wright's venture into the polling business, an apparent attempt
to demonstrate that he was acting on behalf of a majority of House
members to engineer a salary increase, appeared to have backfired in
several ways.
   For one, the speaker failed to consult even his top leadership
team before sending out the 12-question survey form.
   The leaders, in turn, were left scrambling to distance themselves
from what they clearly considered a dubious idea.
   Some senior Democrats were bitter about the move. ``This has
permanently hurt Wright,'' said one, speaking only on condition of
anonymity.
   In addition, the confidential survey was sharply at odds with the
outcomes of several public surveys conducted by the news media and
interest groups.
   Wright said of 326 House members responding privately to his
survey, 57 percent did not want to vote on the pay raise before it
goes into effect at midnight Tuesday.
   But when The Associated Press queried 105 lawmakers, 88 percent
said they did want to vote before the deadline. In an informal poll
of 278 members by the self-described consumer group Public Citizen,
265 _ 61 percent of the House _ said on the record that they wanted
a vote.
   ``Somebody's not telling the truth,'' said Public Citizen's Ralph
Nader, an outspoken pay raise critic. ``For the speaker to expose
members to a charge of lying is a very serious case of leadership
run amok.''
   Wright intended the survey to bolster his strategy of letting the
raise go into effect, then holding a vote to roll it back to 30
percent. But it instead showed the speaker could fall short of the
two-thirds majority needed for a rollback under the expedited
process he chose for bringing the issue to the floor.
   What the results did show was deep division among House members
over the entire issue of congressional pay and how it is set, and
inconsistency between the answers to some questions. For example:
   _ Fifty-six percent favored and 44 percent opposed the process
under which pay levels for lawmakers and top officials are
recommended by an independent commission, proposed by the president
and put in effect automatically unless both houses vote to cancel
them.
   _ On the question of whether they would vote against any effort
to rescind the raise entirely, 49 percent said yes and 46 percent
said no.
   _ Asked if the 50 percent raise for Congress and similar
increases for other top government jobs were ``fair and proper,'' 54
percent said yes. But asked more specifically about the amount of
the increases, 56 percent said they were too high.
   _ A majority, 54 percent, opposed a vote before Wednesday on
banning honoraria, such as fees for speaking before lobbying groups,
and limiting the raise to 30 percent. But after Wednesday, and
following an honoraria ban, 61 percent favored rolling back the pay
raise to 30 percent.
   Only on one question were sentiments near unanimous: 98 percent
said they would vote to ban honoraria if the pay raise goes into
effect.
   The survey ``has put the heat on everybody, and it isn't going to
go away,'' said Rep. Tim Penny of Minnesota, one of the few
Democrats willing to criticize the speaker publicly. ``This issue is
going to leave a bad taste in the mouths of a lot of members, and
eventually that's got to add up. Sooner or later, the good will is
going to be gone.''
   Some lawmakers observed that Wright came into the fray over pay
carrying heavy political baggage from two continuing House Ethics
Committee investigations into his conduct. One case, involving
allegations the speaker abused his office while majority leader for
financial gain, is expected to be resolved late this month.
   Whatever the outcome of that inquiry, Wright will likely face
another public pummeling led by his chief accuser, Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and the fallout from the survey could hurt, said
one prominent House Democrat.
   ``In a matter of weeks, he'll be asking these same people to
stand up for him against Gingrich,'' said the lawmaker.

   William Carter Alexander doesn't get hate mail
from constituents or pressure from lobbying groups. But like
congressmen, federal judges and President Bush's Cabinet officers,
he's up for a sizable pay raise.
   Alexander, research director at an Air Force laboratory in Texas,
is one of 7,100 members of the senior executive service _ managers
of federal programs ranging from space missions to tax collection _
whose pay is tied to presidential recommendations.
   Spokesman Jim Lafferty of the Office of Personnel Management
calls the senior executives ``the top part of the federal
government's middle management.''
   To Carol Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executive Association,
a group formed by the senior managers, they are ``the glue of the
government. Without them it couldn't run.''
   Annual salaries for senior managers now range from $68,700 to
$80,700; they would be $80,000 to $120,000 if the raise takes effect
on Wednesday, with the average being $98,000.
   While Congress and the judges would get a 51 percent raise,
members of the senior executive service would get raises ranging
from 16 percent to 49 percent. Another 700 federal employees known
as ``super graders'' who have management responsibilities would get
similar pay hikes.
   The exact size of the pay increases is in flux, as congressional
leaders deal with mounting pressure to scale back the raise.
   A dozen senior executives interviewed in recent weeks said, not
surprisingly, that they supported the raise. Most said their support
stemmed not solely from personal financial interest but also from a
hope that higher pay will help the government attract top talent.
   Alexander has been a federal employee for 28 years, rising
through the ranks to a position in which he now is directly
responsible for 200 people, five of whom are at top civil service
levels and paid more than he is.
   Still, in Alexander's words, ``It's always my hide if there's a
screw up.''
   Alexander is paid $71,900 a year and said his salary would rise
to $90,000 if Congress allows the pay package to take effect on
Wednesday. He says he could make double that in the private sector,
but won't quit despite having two sons in college and a third in
high school.
   ``I've built a life and career in government and I intend to stay
even after I reach retirement eligibility in two years,'' Alexander
said in a telephone interview.
   Marylouise Uhlig predicts ``a major crisis in government'' if
Congress kills the pay raises, something she said would prompt a
``major exodus'' of managers.
   ``I really do think that you get the kind of government that you
pay for,'' said Uhlig, director of program management at the
Environmental Protection Agency's pesticide and toxic substances
division. ``In order to keep good people you have to pay them.''
   Uhlig's duties as director of the agency's Office of Pesticides
and Toxic Substances range from hiring and budgeting to acting as a
liaison with regional EPA offices.
   ``I'm paying for this raise too,'' is her answer to criticism the
raises will bloat the federal budget. ``My entire salary is taxed.''
   If you want to know how much grain is grown in Nebraska or the
top crop in Utah you might try Fred Vogel, director of the
Agriculture Department's state statistical division.
   ``You look at some of the salaries on the outside and you wonder
why you hang around and listen to all of the government bashing,''
said Vogel, who supervises 675 employees in 45 states and a $40
million budget.
   So why does he?
   ``You get committed to your job and your employees and you feel
that what you're doing helps,'' said Vogel, who now makes $76,400 a
year and would see his pay to jump to $98,000.
   Bonosaro said an informal survey by the Senior Executives
Association supported Uhlig's talk of a mass exodus in the
management posts.
   ``They have no real reason to stay and wait another four years,''
she said. The commission that suggested the raises meets every four
years.
   The commission said the cost of paying the executives' raises
would be $41 million in the current fiscal year and $71 million next
year. ``Less than a third of the cost of a B-1 bomber,'' is the
comparison made by Bonosaro.

<HEAD>Day of Reckoning Nears for Bush Budget Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As a candidate, George Bush promised a
``kinder, gentler nation'' without saying how he'd pay for it. Now,
with the day of reckoning near, President Bush's efforts to finance
his campaign promises are meeting unexpected complications.
   The difficulty of crafting a rescue plan for the troubled
savings-and-loan industry and disagreement over defense spending
levels are making it harder for budget officials to finish rewriting
former President Reagan's $1.15 trillion fiscal 1990 budget,
according to administration and congressional sources.
   Bush goes before a joint session of Congress and a nationwide
televison audience Thursday to hang a pricetag on his campaign vows
and to show how he'll meet Gramm-Rudman defict targets while
adhering to his ``read my lips, no new taxes'' slogan.
   Bush's budget, according to sources, probably won't look as good
on paper as did Reagan's, which proclaimed a deficit reduction in
the upcoming fiscal year to $92.8 billion _ down from the estimated
$161.5 billion in the current year.
   The new budget will project a deficit barely under the $100
billion ceiling called for in the Gramm-Rudman law, which aims for a
balanced budget by 1993 through declining annual steps, the sources
said.
   The president's campaign proposals for new spending on education,
child care, the homeless and environmental cleanup add up to well
over $5 billion _ money that his administration is finding all but
impossible to squeeze from already tight federal ledgers.
   With just a few days to go, Bush aides said, many pivotal
decisions have yet to be made by the president, including whether to
go along with his predecessor's proposed $4 billion increase in
defense spending, or to freeze it at the rate of inflation _ which
would free up about $2 billion for other programs.
   Although Bush has generally proposed a ``flexible freeze'' that
would hold overall spending at the rate of inflation, some key
aides, including Chief of Staff John Sununu, have reportedly been
pressing for higher levels of defense spending.
   Administration officials, who insisted upon anonymity, have said
Bush's budget will call for lower defense spending than proposed by
Reagan, but how much lower had not yet been determined.
   Congressional sources, who requested anonymity, said the
administration is looking into the option of no growth except for
inflation, possibly over a three-year period.
   The administration officials also said that some of Bush's
campaign promises will surface in scaled-back form in the budget, or
not be financed at all. Still, a senior official said that the major
ones would at least be noted, if not fully paid for.
   Among Bush's more ambitious campaign promises: a $1,000
child-care tax credit for low-income families; a $500 million
National Merit School program to aid the country's best schools; a
multiyear $5 billion program to attack acid rain; expansion of
Medicaid, housing vouchers for the poor and a new tax-free
individual savings plan.
   Bush will also have to find money in his budget to pay for
cleaning up deteriorating nuclear plants.
   Given his no-tax pledge and the tightness of available funds, it
seems unlikely that Bush can afford to retreat from Reagan's
proposal to ax more than five-dozen programs; or to restore much of
the $5.5 billion cuts in Medicare proposed by the former president.
   Coming up with a budget plan in time for Thursday's address to
Congress has been complicated by the savings-and-loan crisis.
Federal regulators say that from $85 billion to $100 billion will be
needed to shore up the industry.
   Bush and his top financial advisers were huddled Saturday at the
presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., trying to work out a
solution.
   An original trial balloon by the administration to charge
depositors a fee of 25 cents for each $100 on deposit was quickly
deflated on Capitol Hill. Still, White House aides were reluctant to
rule it out entirely, claiming the means for raising the rescue
funds had dwindled to a precious few.
   Congressional speculation as of Saturday was that the
administration would propose raising the money through the sale of
special 30-year Treasury bonds, with an increase in insurance fees
paid by financial institutions to cover the $6 billion to $7 billion
cost of servicing, or paying interest on, the bonds.
   The president also must make room in his budget for his proposal
to reduce the tax on capital gains to a maximum of 15 percent _ and
then to use what he claims will be increased revenues from that move
to pay for other tax breaks.
   Those include restoring tax benefits for the oil and gas industry
and establishing tax-free ``enterprise zones'' in inner cities.
   In all, it's a big order for a new president who conceded even in
his inaugural address that there was ``more will than wallet.''
   In a speech Friday to a group of business leaders, Bush said,
``next week, we're going to have to come forward with some tough
decisions.''
   And, he added, ``I've heard from a lot of you here the importance
of having what we send up there credible, so that world markets will
understand that this is for real.''

<HEAD>Reports: Hostages To Be Freed Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five Lebanese publications predicted
Saturday that some foreign hostages held in Lebanon will be freed
soon. One magazine said two of the nine missing Americans will be
released.
   Also Saturday, Irish Ambassador Patrick McCabe, who spent one
week in Lebanon trying to verify reports hostage Brian Keenan might
be released, said there was ``a distinct possibility'' Keenan would
be freed.
   The reports marked the first time several Lebanese publications
have simultaneously carried nearly identical articles about the
possible release of foreign captives. The reports came shortly after
a top Iranian official and a Shiite Moslem leader predicted a
breakthrough in the hostage problem.
   The An-Nahar Arab and International weekly said the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah has ``decided to release two American
captives as a goodwill gesture.'' It gave no names.
   The magazine, based in Christian east Beirut, quoted an
unidentified Hezbollah official as saying: ``The scenario is being
set for the release.'' The brief report did not elaborate.
   Hezbollah, made up of Shiite Moslem zealots, is believed to be
the umbrella organization for several groups holding hostages.
   There are 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon. In addition to the
nine Americans and Keenan, who holds both Irish and British
citizenship, there are three Britons, an Italian and a Belgian.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   The leftist daily As-Safir, which has close ties with the Syrian
army command in Lebanon, said: ``Diplomatic information speaks of
the possible release of some (foreign) hostages in the next two
weeks.''
   The weekly Ash-Shiraa said the hostage issue ``has been put on a
hot burner.'' Its brief report said without elaborating: ``This
could result in releasing them ... in the light of a decision to
this effect adopted by regional powers interested in this case.''
   The independent An-Nahar and conservative Ad-Diyar dailies both
said a peace pact reached Monday in Damascus between Hezbollah and
Amal, the rival pro-Syrian Shiite militia, also aims at securing the
release of foreign captives. The pact, sponsored by Syria and Iran,
halted a nine-month war between the rival militias.
   ``Informed sources believe that the basic aim of the
Amal-Hezbollah accord is to work on the release of foreign captives
held in Lebanon,'' said An-Nahar, Lebanon's most prestigious
newspaper. The report did not elaborate.
   Ad-Diyar quoted an unidentified official as saying the
Amal-Hezbollah accord ``could result in the handing over of some
foreign hostages to the Syrians.''
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon with 40,000 troops
deployed in predominantly Moslem areas.
   In the past, some foreign captives were set free in
Syrian-controlled sectors of Lebanon, and the Syrians took credit
for their release.
   The Irish ambassador, who spent one week in Lebanon trying to
verify reports about Keenan's possible release, returned to Iraq on
Saturday.
   Before departing he told reporters: ``I leave with the impression
that the release of Brian Keenan before long remains a distinct
possibility.''
   Keenan, a teacher from Belfast, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 in
Beirut's Moslem sector. No group has claimed his abduction.
   McCabe said he would return to Lebanon ``in coming weeks or
sooner'' if necessary.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Announces Summit Date</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze ended
a three-day visit to China on Saturday by announcing the nations
will hold their first summit in 30 years in mid-May.
   Shevardnadze said Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will travel
to Beijing at the invitation of the Chinese for a meeting with
senior leader Deng Xiaoping. Soviet sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the summit was tentatively scheduled for May 15.
   China's Deputy Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei, however, said no
date had been set and that the Chinese were ``studying the
proposal'' for the May meeting.
   Shevardnadze later flew to Islamabad, Pakistan, for meetings with
Pakistani leaders about the Soviet troop withdrawal from neighboring
Afghanistan.
   At a news conference before his departure, Shevardnadze said Deng
told him the summit would ``close the page on the past and open up a
chapter on the future.''
   In a move toward ``complete normalization'' of relations,
diplomats and other officials are to discuss reducing military
tensions along the 5,000-mile Soviet-Chinese border, he said.
   Western diplomats said the issue first came up when Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited Moscow in December.
   ``We hope at the summit we will be able to make progress in that
important direction,'' Shevardnadze said.
   He said the first step might be an agreement on advance notice of
troop movements and military exercises, and then negotiations for
disbanding offensive forces.
   In the 1950s, China depended on Soviet technical and military aid
and followed the Soviet lead in diplomatic policy. Relations between
the countries soured in 1960 over ideological and strategic
disputes, and they fought a brief border war in 1969.
   The Chinese agreed to discuss a summit last year after progress
was made on what they call the ``three obstacles'' _ border
tensions, Soviet aid for Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and the
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   The last Soviet troops are supposed to be out of Afghanistan by
Feb. 15.
   Gorbachev has pledged to remove from Asia 200,000 Soviet troops,
many now stationed along the Chinese border, and has said that most
of Moscow's 50,000 troops in Mongolia will be withdrawn.
   Qian was the first Chinese foreign minister to visit Moscow in 32
years. Shevardnadze's visit was the first by a Soviet foreign
minister in 30 years and was designed to lay the groundwork for the
summit.
   China formally issued its invitation to Gorbachev on Friday.
   ``Substantive progress has been made'' on obstacles that have
stood in the way of a summit, Deputy Foreign Minister Tian told
reporters following Shevardnadze's departure. ``This visit produced
results.''
   He said the two sides now agree that Vietnam should end its
10-year occupation of Cambodia by September as promised and that
there should be international supervision of the troop withdrawal.
   China backs the anti-Vietnamese resistance in Cambodia and has
demanded Moscow pressure its ally, Vietnam, to pull out.
   Shevardnadze said better Sino-Soviet relations are the result of
the countries' economic reforms and he envisioned increased trading
between the nations.
   The countries are believed to want to ease tensions so they can
concentrate less on military matters and more on rejuvenating their
economies.
   Shevardnadze flew to Shanghai, about 870 miles south of Beijing,
for the 90-minute meeting with Deng on Saturday morning.
   He said China's top leader was ``a very wise man who has a lot of
rich experience.''
   There have been rumors that the 84-year-old Deng is in failing
health but Shevardnadze said he appeared quite fit.

<HEAD>Antarctic Oil Spill May Threaten Wildlife Research, Scientists Fear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil from a sunken ship off Antarctica threatens
not only the environment in a pristine bay, but also wildlife
research in a biologically rich area prized until now for its
unspoiled state, scientists say.
   ``The paths of research that have been followed down there have
been forever changed,'' said National Science Foundation spokesman
Jack Talmadge. ``I think if you're a scientist in the year 2035,
you've got to remember there was an oil spill.''
   Ted DeLaca, chief scientist of the foundation's polar programs,
said the highly sensitive environment ``has been compromised in a
way that we can't even evaluate right now.''
   While the spill's effect on future research cannot yet be
determined, ``it's something I find personally disturbing,'' he said
by telephone Friday from Palmer Station, a research outpost near the
spill.
   The oil is leaking from an Argentine research and supply ship
that ran aground Jan. 25. The ship is nearly submerged on shoals in
the Bismarck Strait just off the Antarctic peninsula, 600 miles from
the tip of South America.
   Authorities said the ship carried at least 200,000 gallons of
fuel oil in its tanks and more in drums lashed to the deck. American
cleanup crews are expected to reach the site sometime this week.
   Some scientists said the effects of the spill may be magnified
because it involved fuel oil, more dangerous to wildlife than crude
oil, and because Antarctic conditions could slow the oil's
decomposition.
   The spill struck an area that has ``the largest and most diverse
plant and animal populations of the continent,'' said Polly Penhale,
manager of the science foundation's polar biology and medicine
program.
   Apart from a large seal population, some 30,000 sea birds live in
the area affected by the spill, including Adele and chinstrap
penguins, cormorants, kelp gulls and giant petrels, Penhale said.
   ``It is one of the most spectacularly beautiful areas in the
whole Antarctica,'' said Sayed Z. El-Sayed, an oceanography
professor at Texas A&amp;M University who has studied it for 25 years.
   Most plants and animals live on islands off the mainland, where
the science foundation operates Palmer Station on a spit of rock.
   Scientists have already seen oil-covered and apparently lethargic
seals, three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting
birds, DeLaca said.
   Thirty-eight of 40 penguins checked Friday bore traces of oil.
Thousands of dead and dying krill, shrimplike crustaceans that are a
key food for bigger animals, have shown up on beaches, he said.
   ``All the principal (penguin) rookeries here are now surrounded
by fuel oil,'' he said. ``What its effect could be on the birds is
anybody's guess.''
   Birds can freeze to death if the oil disrupts their natural
insulation, or be poisoned if they swallow oil while preening
themselves or eating contaminated prey.
   Scientists have studied wildlife in the area for more than 20
years, focusing on birds and seals and also on such organisms as
fish, kelp, krill and shelled animals called limpets.
   ``One of the main concerns of the scientists ... is that that
area stay pristine, because we have a lot of environmental research
that's going on,'' said Langdon Quetin, research biologist at the
University of California in Santa Barbara.
   ``It is one of the few areas in the Antarctic we have good
logistics to,'' he said. The spill ``will be the ruination of a good
laboratory, at least in the near future, at least as a natural
uncontaminated study area.''
   Some scientists are particularly concerned about fish and other
organisms kept in tanks at Palmer Station, which marine botanist
Mike Neushul of the University of California at Santa Barbara calls
``probably the best marine biology laboratory in the Antarctic.''
   The tanks draw seawater from the nearby harbor, and if oil
contaminates that supply, the experiments might have to be stopped.
Nobody knows yet whether that will be a problem, Penhale said.
   Neushul said one factor boding poorly for the area's wildlife is
that the spill involved fuel oil, which is much more toxic than
crude oil because it can damage biological tissue.
   Neushul, who investigated a spill of partially refined oil off
Baja California 30 years ago, said that spill caused mass deaths of
fish, starfish, sea urchins and other animals. The same may happen
to similar animals in the Antarctic, he said.
   In the California spill, the environment took 17 years to
recover, he said. Recovery in Antarctica may take even longer
because bacteria there will need a long time to break the oil down,
said Paul Dayton, professor of marine ecology at the Scripps
Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.
   After years of studying wildlife in a pristine environment,
researchers are now turning to monitor how the wildlife responds to
the oil spill, Talmadge said. ``This disaster is the experiment
nobody wanted,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nearly 140,000 AIDS Cases Reported Worldwide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization says 7,000 new AIDS
cases were reported last month, raising the worldwide total to
nearly 140,000.
   Most of the increase was due to updated reports on acquired
immune deficiency syndrome from the Americas and Europe, WHO said
Friday in its monthly update on the spread of the deadly disease.
   The United States reported more than half of the new cases,
nearly 4,000.
   WHO estimated the real number of adult cases was between 350,000
and 400,000 by the end of last year, with sub-Saharan Africa thought
to account for more than half the victims. The U.N. agency noted
that the accuracy of reports on AIDS patients varies widely between
countries and continents.
   WHO said 139,886 cases were reported from 144 countries by Jan.
31, a rise of 6,910 over a month earlier. Thirty-three countries
said they had no cases.
   New Caledonia, the French Pacific territory, reported its first
victims: two as of Aug. 1.
   The United States, which has recorded 60 percent of all AIDS
cases, reported 3,965 new cases last month.
   France, with the highest total and case rate in Europe, reported
an increase of 781 to 5,655 cases.
   Italy reported 452 new victims, bringing its total to 3,008.
   Spain's figure rose to 2,165 with the report of 315 new cases.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Reagan Busy With Post-Presidency Deals, Settling In Bel-Air</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan left the White House two weeks
ago to retire as elder statesman in his beloved California, but
instead of lounging around the pool he's been busy lining up work
and visiting old haunts.
   The ex-president has signed a book deal worth up to $7 million,
lined up a $50,000-per-speech lecture contract and opened his
Century City offices, where a variety of offers are pouring in.
   There are also social demands: His 78th birthday party Monday
night at the ritzy Bistro Gardens, a Feb. 23 Palm Springs gala
honoring Elizabeth Taylor and a private welcome-home dinner Feb. 25.
   ``The change of address hasn't caused any slowing down of their
schedule,'' said Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg. ``They are very
active and on the go.''
   Reagan and wife Nancy haven't even taken time yet to visit their
Santa Barbara mountaintop Rancho del Cielo. Rumors they might sell
the ranch have repeatedly been denied by the Reagan staff.
   Shunning the reclusive lifestyle of many celebrities, the couple
often venture from their Bel-Air home to dine at Chasens, attend
Sunday church services or visit friends.
   Secret Service agents drive Reagan from his $2.5 million hillside
home to Century City, a distance of five miles, where he takes a
private elevator to his 34th-floor office suite at Fox Plaza and
spends about six hours daily at his desk.
   Foreign dignitaries dropping in on Reagan have included Ugandan
President H.E. Yoweri K. Museveni and Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita.
   He has received a telephone call from Henry Kissinger, a telegram
from Britain's Prince Charles and flowers from neighbors.
   Reagan invited news photographers to his office last week to take
pictures of him at his desk before a private office lunch with his
former agent, MCA Inc. Chairman Lew Wasserman.
   Reagan is apparently fielding corporate board membership offers,
with MCA and the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball franchise seen as sure
bets. He also is being sought for radio, television and motion
pictures.
   Hours after relinquishing the presidency to George Bush on Jan.
20, Reagan told cheering supporters at a Los Angeles International
Airport rally that he had been asked to star in a sequel to
``Bedtime for Bonzo,'' the 1951 comedy he shared with a chimpanzee.
   ``Only this time they wanted me to play Bonzo,'' he joked.
   However, longtime friend Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar, who said he was
working on an unspecified project for the ex-president, dismissed as
``ridiculous'' the possibility of a Reagan cinematic comeback.
   ``There are many invitations for a variety of opportunities, but
President Reagan has no current plans to appear in any movies,''
Weinberg said.
   However, the nation may hear Reagan on Saturday morning radio
again, expressing his thoughts and opinions, Lazar said.
   For now, Reagan's top priority is his memoirs, a book for Simon &amp;
Schuster that the former president promised would be ``an honest and
straightforward look at where we have been, with some thoughts on
where we're going.''
   ``He is working on the book every day, going through files and
handwriting his thoughts on a legal pad,'' Weinberg said.
   On Monday, Reagan details his plans during a 20-minute no-fee
speech at the University of Southern California, his first public
appearance since the Jan. 20 homecoming rally. ``He's spending the
weekend working on it,'' Weinberg said.
   Reagan also is expected to produce messages condemning abortion
and to campaign for a change in the 22nd Amendment, which limits
presidents to two terms. ``It's an infringement on your democratic
rights,'' private citizen Reagan said after Bush's inaugural.
   Mouaffak Al Midani, who has a Beverly Hills estate and reportedly
owns utilities in Saudi Arabia, has expressed interest in Mrs.
Reagan's anti-drug crusade, Weinberg said. Money is still needed for
the Nancy Reagan Center for drug rehabilitation proposed for a site
in the San Fernando Valley.
   Mrs. Reagan's calendar includes a meeting this month with Los
Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and an anti-drug video sponsored
by Kiwanis International.

   Amber, Michaela and Ilene: young girls
living anonymous lives in quiet, middle-class suburbs of San
Francisco until one by one they disappeared without a trace.
   It isn't as if a child has never vanished, been kidnapped or run
away from any of the commuter towns near the bay. But some see
unsettling similarities in these three cases, although they remain
unexplained and unsolved.
   Seven-year-old Amber Schwart-Garcia vanished June 3 after she
went to play in the front yard of her Pinole home.
   Five months later, on Nov. 19, Amber's case drew new attention.
That was the day 9-year-old Michaela Joy Garecht was snatched by a
stringy-haired stranger in a dingy car outside a market in Hayward,
about 30 miles south of Pinole.
   Michaela and a friend had ridden their scooters a short distance
from home to get some candy and pop. The friend said she watched in
horror as the man grabbed Michaela and roared off.
   Hayward and Pinole are situated just off busy freeways that serve
communities along San Francisco Bay. Near Hayward, Interstate 580
shoots off to the east, heading to other communities that share the
two towns' rambling housing tracts, kids on skateboards, fast-food
restaurants and shopping malls.
   Communities like Dublin, where 13-year-old Ilene Misheloff
disappeared Monday.
   She was last seen about 3 p.m., walking along a major
thoroughfare on her way to a skating rink. Her family describes her
as a good student, a girl who never varied from her routine without
letting her parents know.
   At first reluctant to categorize her disappearance as a
kidnapping, investigators said Friday that she may indeed have been
kidnapped.
   Evidence of community concern is everywhere. Yellow ribbons dot
virtually every major Dublin street. People can be seen posting
pictures of Ilene on utility poles in the rain.
   Ilene's synagogue held a prayer service for her Thursday night
and local churches plan to do the same in coming days.
   ``All the parents I know have sat their children down and talked
to them,'' said Connie Spence, one of the volunteers who worked
feverishly Friday answering phones, passing out fliers and accepting
donations.
   Robert E. Lee, a resident of Benicia about 35 miles north of
Dublin, dropped by the volunteers' headquarters with enough paper to
make 45,000 fliers with Ilene's picture.
   ``I've got 10 grandchildren,'' he said, ``so I feel for what's
happened.''
   People traveling to Lake Tahoe and Oregon have picked up fliers,
as did an airline pilot flying East. The Postal Service is passing
out fliers in Dublin and Pleasanton along with the mail.
   ``We can't even begin to understand the feelings of the
parents,'' said Pleasanton Postmaster Jose Cantu. ``But we know that
if it were our kids, we'd want help, too.''
   At Ilene's school, Wells Intermediate, few children walk to
school alone these days.
   ``We all are being more careful,'' said Toni Dona, whose daughter
is a classmate of Ilene's. ``The kids are grouping together and the
parents are car-pooling.''
   ``It's constantly on their minds, when they see that empty chair
next to them. It's hard not to think about it,'' Dona said.
``Especially when you turn on the news every morning and hear about
it. And now we're not hearing anything _ which is even worse.''
   Police say they've received about 200 calls a day, not counting
those coming in on the toll-free hotline.
   The FBI has joined the investigation, but spokesman Chuck Latting
said the agency has nothing more to report than police. There's no
proof Ilene's disappearance is related to the others, but no
evidence to rule out the possibility either, he said.
   Ilene's parents, Michael and Madelyne Misheloff, said they spoke
with their children after Michaela's disappearance, just as they had
warned them before about being careful around strangers.
   Before his daughter's disappearance, Misheloff familiarized
himself with a sketch of the suspect in the Garecht case. But he
said he had not been unduly alarmed that the same thing could happen
to his children.
   ``This is a very quiet community, low-crime area, where if there
is a crime, you notice it ... not like in one of the large cities
where there seems to be a serious crime just about every day,'' he
said.
   Ilene's parents said they have no gut feeling about whether her
disappearance is linked to the others.
   ``Unfortunately for all of us, three children are gone ... and
one of them is our daughter,'' said Mrs. Misheloff, choking back
tears.
   ``She's not home, and it's cold and it's raining.''

   John Tower's reputation and the intent of the
Senate Armed Services Committee to conduct a thorough investigation
collided head-on this week as the expected confirmation of the
defense secretary-designate hit a snag.
   New allegations surfaced Thursday of a drinking problem and
womanizing, prompting the committee to postpone a planned vote on
Tower's nomination until the FBI could complete a new inquiry.
   Despite the new twist to the well-circulated but unsubstantiated
rumors, senators said they expect the Senate panel to approve the
Tower nomination and forward their recommendation to the full Senate.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the panel,
said he expected the FBI report to reach the panel on Monday, ``and
... we can proceed to vote Tuesday or Wednesday.''
   Tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before
his nomination. In divorce papers filed two years ago by his second
wife, Lilla Burt Cummings, Tower was accused of ``marital
misconduct.''
   When President Bush announced Tower's appointment, he said an FBI
background check found nothing that would prevent Tower from serving
as defense secretary. Bush dismissed ``a lot of rumors that proved
to be groundless.''
   The ranking members of the committee, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and
Warner, read the FBI report, and any questions about Tower's
personal life were reserved for executive sessions with committee
members.
   But when conservative lobbyist Paul Weyrich testified Tuesday at
the committee's open hearing that ``on a number of occasions'' he
had seen Tower inebriated and in the company of women other than his
wife, the former senator's lifestyle was pushed to the forefront.
   One day later, according to congressional sources, the committee
and the White House received new allegations regarding Tower, and
the vote was postponed.
   Complicating matters is the committee's concerns about an
appearance of conflict of interest.
   After his 24-year tenure in the Senate, including a stint as
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Tower worked as a defense
consultant for such industry giants as Rockwell and Martin-Marietta.
In his testimony, Tower said he received more than $1 million in
consulting fees over a 2{-year period.
   Although Tower said he had severed all ties with the companies,
and promised to recuse himself from any decision on an Air Force
electronics system that he had lobbied for, members of the committee
still voiced concern over conflict of interest.
   ``But what is the difference, in terms of the appearance, as to
whether or not you lobbied Congress for a program or whether or not
you advanced that program through other means?'' Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., asked Tower on Wednesday. ``Isn't the same connection to
that program in existence?''
   ``Senator, that's a judgment call on my part, and that's the only
one in which I might have had some profile,'' Tower responded. ``I
would emphasize I am not legally required to do this, but I have an
abundance of caution, and that's a judgment call that I'm making
myself.''
   The committee also is conscious of its experience with Melvyn
Paisley, a key figure in the Pentagon procurement investigation.
Paisley was nominated in 1981 as assistant secretary of Navy and
later confirmed.
   Tower, committee chairman at the time, said the White House
refused the panel's request to see the FBI report on Paisley. Nunn
and Warner said if they had known of the allegations against Paisley
they would have withheld approval until the charges had been checked.
   The ranking members of the 1989 committee would like to avoid a
similar incident.
   ``It's not over till it's over,'' Nunn said Thursday. ``The
investigation is not over until all serious allegations have been
checked, and that's the process we always follow.''

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of supporters of a Moslem party
demonstrated Saturday near the Soviet Embassy to protest what they
called the Red Army's ``continued atrocities in Afghanistan.''
   More than 500 members of the Bangladesh Moslem Movement
participated in the protest.
   Witnesses said two truckloads of policemen followed the
protestors as they marched toward the Soviet Embassy. The
demonstrators were stopped a few hundred yards from the embassy, but
a six-member delegation was allowed to enter the mission to submit a
memorandum, according to the witnesses.
   Party chief Maulana Azizur Rahman said the Soviets were killing
Afghan Moslems ``with a sense of vengeance.''
   ``They have adopted a scorched-earth policy to kill Moslem
brethren and destroy Afghanistan,'' he told a meeting of the
demonstrators. ``The peace-loving people of the world will not
tolerate this.''
   ``It is painful to believe that the Soviets continue their
barbarism in Afghanistan even when they are withdrawing for the
establishment of peace in the region,'' said Maulana Shamsur Rahman,
another party leader.
   The Soviets have been accused of heavily bombing Afghan villages
along the Salang Highway, the route taken by withdrawing Soviet
soldiers, to reduce attacks by Moslem guerrillas stationed nearby.
   Soviet troops moved into Afghanistan in 1979 to support the
Marxist government in a civil war against Moslem rebels.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored accord last year, the Soviet troops are
scheduled to withdraw from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.

<HEAD>By GENE KRAMER</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was inevitable that Japanese Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita would be asked during his get-acquainted call on
the new Bush administration whether he addressed the U.S. president
by his first name.
   Each new prime minister of Japan generally visits Washington
early in his term to demonstrate to the Japanese public that he will
have good relations with his country's big trans-Pacific ally.
   Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister in 1982-87, set a new standard
by proclaiming his vibrations with President Ronald Reagan so
positive that they called each other ``Ron and Yasu,'' American
style.
   Nakasone's successor, Takeshita, met that challenge a year ago
when he was able to announce here that he had cultivated a
``Ron-Nobu'' first-name relationship with Reagan.
   And Takeshita happily told a Japanese embassy gathering here
Thursday that he and ``George'' had decided to use first names. He
added that he hopes they can have casual telephone exchanges and
told reporters he was impressed by Bush's character and intelligence.
   Bush, addressing Takeshita at the White House Thursday, referred
to the late Japanese emperor not as Hirohito but as Emperor Showa.
The president was using the Japanese style of referring to a former
emperor by the name of his era.
   The emperor, whose funeral Bush plans to attend Feb. 24 in Tokyo,
died last month in the year Showa 63, which at the time was the
Japanese calendar equivalent of 1989. The same year is now Heisei 1,
using the name of the new era of Emperor Akihito. Showa means
``Enlightened Peace,'' Heisei, ``Peaceful Achievement.''
   Takeshita told Bush the Japanese people were deeply moved by his
decision to attend the state funeral.
   A former schoolteacher, Takeshita recalled at lunch in the State
Department's Benjamin Franklin Room that he was not very good at
helping Japanese high school youngsters learn English, but he did
teach them ``through Ben Franklin's writings, why America is so
great and how Americans respect freedom, independence and
diligence.''
   ``The spirit of the American Revolution, as represented by
Franklin, is alive and well,'' he added.
   Another Takeshita story was that he had stayed in Blair House,
the U.S. presidential guest residence, 20 years ago as a 43-year-old
aide to the late Prime Minister Eisaku Sato when Sato visited former
President Richard Nixon. His boss suggested he should plan to stay
in Blair House again on a future visit _ meaning he should aim at
becoming prime minister. It came true.
   Takeshita and Secretary of State James Baker III reminisced about
when they were their countries' respective finance ministers at the
1985 New York Plaza Hotel meeting that grappled with currency
exchange rates.
   Takeshita said currency rates ``should be decided by God and I
agree with that,'' Baker, then U.S. Treasury secretary, recalled
jokingly. One American dollar was then worth 245 Japanese yen but
Takeshita and other finance ministers said it should be 215-220 yen,
and ``two weeks later it became 215 yen,'' Baker said. Today, one
dollar is worth in the range of 130 yen.
   By coincidence finance ministers of the same seven ``G-7''
countries, accompanied by their staffs, met in Washington during
Takeshita's latest visit. His last day here, he dropped in at their
meeting for a brief round of handshakes with old acquaintances.
   From Washington, Takeshita started home via Los Angeles, where he
plans to meet his friend ``Ron'' Reagan Monday. A spokesman said it
was in the tradition of Japanese etiquette that the prime minister
should personally wish the retired president well and thank him for
his leadership of the Western alliance.
   Asked why it was necessary for the prime minister to wait through
the weekend for Monday, spokesman Koichi Haraguchi said Reagan's
schedule was such that ``they can meet only on Feb. 6.''

<HEAD>Plant-Closings Debate Still Raging as Law Takes Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Levi Strauss &amp; Co. announced last week it
would close a denim jacket plant in Tennessee, it gave 140 workers
90 days' paid notice.
   It was a better cushion than most workers have been getting when
plants close down.
   Levi Strauss was following voluntary policies in place since
1984, guaranteeing workers advance notice of pending plant closings.
   Notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs, however, is now
the law.
   Plant closing legislation passed by Congress last year took full
effect Saturday, with business and labor still debating its impact
and both sides predicting a flood of lawsuits.
   ``The companies are mystified at how complicated this law really
is,'' said Renee Reymond of the National Association of
Manufacturers. ``The labor attorneys certainly are poised and ready
for business.''
   Supporters say the law will not hurt business and gives workers a
time to prepare for job loss. Federal figures show 64 percent of the
nearly 2 million workers idled annually receive no notice.
   Opponents maintain the law represents a threat to industry.
   ``The threat is one of government fines, lawsuits, back pay and
benefits expenses, loss of market image and costly training and
adjustment problems,'' the Virginia Employers Association declared
recently.
   Then-President Reagan allowed the measure to become law in August
without his signature, despite having earlier called it ``a ticking
time bomb in the back seat of any medium-sized or larger company.''
   Pressure from then presidential candidate George Bush was said to
have influenced Reagan.
   On Capitol Hill, supporters of the concept still say it was long
overdue.
   ``The `chicken littles' have been proven wrong again,'' said Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``The sky did not fall. Enactment of this
law was a triumph of reason over ideology and American workers will
now receive the notice they deserve.''
   Provisions of the law call for it to take effect Saturday, but
some employers have started early on the theory that courts may
eventually hold that shutdowns up to 60 days beforehand were covered.
   Lehigh Structural Steel Co. of Allentown, Pa., for example,
announced Jan. 24 that its 184 employees would be laid off after
current orders are filled. President R. Leslie Mullen said in a
telephone interview last week that the company was observing the
60-day notice period.
   ``Nobody can seem to tell us what the law is, so we're being
safe,'' Mullen said.
   A random survey of a dozen companies that have announced
shutdowns or major layoffs in the past two months found that nearly
all had given their workers at least 60 days' notice, most because
of company policies in place before the law was passed.
   For example:
   _Pillsbury Co. said last week it would close a pizza plant in
Missouri and a potato flake plant in North Dakota, idling 334
workers who got 60 days' notice.
   _AT&amp;T recently announced plans to close two facilities in the
Washington, D.C., area, one with 500 workers, the other 130. Many
are being offered jobs elesewhere in the company and AT&amp;T has a
policy of giving a minimum 90-day notice, spokesman Don Griffith
said.
   _Mack Trucks Inc. five weeks ago announced it was laying off 300
workers at its Macungie, Pa., assembly plant, but since has said
only about half that many would lose their jobs.
   Mack spokeswoman Debbie Morgan said the union workers had been
told of the initial layoff plans several months before the
announcement.
   ``Our policy has been that we're not going to wait until February
to be in compliance,'' she said. ``We decided to treat it as if it
was in effect immediately.''
   But about 130 workers at a microwave plant in Sioux Falls, S.D.,
who lost their jobs Friday got only one week notice. The layoffs do
not appear to be covered by the law _ even under the liberal
interpretation of its effective date.
   The law requires advance notice of plant closings by employers
with at least 100 full-time workers if the shutdown will cost 50 or
more of those employees their jobs. In the case of layoffs, notices
are required if the number of affected workers totals 33 percent of
the company's employees or 500 _ whichever figure is lower.
   In Sioux Falls, Microwave Products of America began the year with
about 650 workers at its plant and in January laid off 155. That
left the company with about 495 workers. By laying off 130 workers
the company fell about 35 short of the 33 percent threshold.
   ``It was reviewed,'' company spokesman Gordon Taylor said when
asked about the plant closing law. He said the company's position
was that the law did not carry weight until after Saturday and also
noted that regardless of the effective date the layoffs did not meet
the threshold.

<HEAD>United States Pays Another $28.8 Million Toward Back U.N. Dues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States has paid late U.N. dues
of nearly $30 million, but it remains almost $500 million behind in
payments to the regular U.N. budget, officials said.
   The United States is in the process of paying back money it
withheld several years ago when Washington complained of what it
viewed as mismanagement and anti-Western bias at the United Nations.
   Washington's second-ranking U.N. ambassador, Herbert S. Okun,
delivered the $28.8 million dues check Friday to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, U.N. officials said. He
also gave Perez de Cuellar a $7.3 million check to help pay for U.N.
peacekeepers in Cyprus.
   The United States is assessed for one-fourth of the U.N.'s
regular budget of about $880 million annually. Friday's payment
ended U.S dues obligations for 1988.
   However, U.N. financial spokesman Fred Eckhart said the United
States still owes the world body $279 million for unpaid pre-1988
dues and $216 million for 1989 dues.
   In 1985, the Reagan administration and Congress began withholding
substantial amounts of U.N. dues to spur the world body into cutting
its staff and imposing fiscal reform. Reagan and several congressmen
also criticized the United Nations for what they viewed as
anti-Western bias.
   In September, however, Reagan announced he was satisfied with the
U.N.'s progress toward reform and its role in mediating the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq cease-fire. He said
the United States would begin repaying the money it owed.

<HEAD>Settlement With Ex-Mayor's Mistress Causes Uproar</HEAD>

   Quietly arranged payments to the mistress
and two aides of a former mayor have sent City Hall into an uproar,
with threats that the City Council may strip the mayor of some of
his power.
   Mayor Brian J. Sarault, who is preparing to run for a second term
in this old industrial city, says he was just cleaning up the ``tray
of garbage'' left by his predecessor, Henry S. Kinch.
   Some City Council members, upset that they weren't consulted
before the claims against the city were settled, want to end the
mayor's power to settle claims unilaterally.
   ``From a business standpoint, it may have made sense to settle
these,'' said Councilman John Q. Calista. ``But the fact remains,
the public perception is one of rumors, innuendos, lack of
confidence and mistrust.''
   ``The council was never notified (of settlements) before, either.
Why are we being held to a different standard?'' Sarault replied.
``We've been more open around here and I'm getting kicked in the
teeth for it.''
   ``Each of the problems I've been resolving, they're left over
from the previous administration, which left me a tray of garbage
that I have to clean up,'' said Sarault, who faces re-election in
November. ``I literally didn't have a pen in my desk when I took
over.''
   The controversy in this city of 73,500 began last May, when the
council discovered that Kinch, who declined to seek a fourth term in
1987, had awarded himself and eight aides a total of $128,000 in
severance pay before leaving office.
   The situation attracted a wider audience in early January, after
headlines about Sarault's agreement to pay former City Clerk Penny
Maynard $40,000 to settle a sex-discrimination complaint. She
accused Kinch of firing her after their extramarital affair ended.
   ``That had all the makings of a class B movie,'' Sarault said.
   There was no comment from Kinch; he did not return a reporter's
telephone calls.
   Sarault and City Solicitor Fred Joslyn said they settled the case
because Maynard stood a good chance of winning a much larger
judgment at trial.
   Council members complained they were never notified about the
settlement, which was reached in October.
   Their complaints reached fever pitch when two other settlements
were revealed _ one with Joslyn himself, whom Kinch fired from a
city finance job because he leaked information to then-Councilman
Sarault.
   ``If the newspaper reporters hadn't walked in there, who knows if
it ever would have come out?'' said Councilman James Doyle, a
Sarault opponent.
   Council President Raymond W. Houle Jr. said mayors have never
made a practice of disclosing settlements.
   ``I'm in my 20th year on the council,'' Houle said. ``In all
those years, never once has any city solicitor ever reported to the
council on any case nor has any council member ever questioned the
city solicitor about any case.''
   At a recent Council meeting, Sarault promised to keep the council
better informed about settlements.
   A motion by one of his opponents to strip the mayor of his power
to settle cases was deferred.
   Most of the council members said they were satisfied by the
mayor's promises, but Doyle remained unconvinced.
   ``He's giving us a little pat and saying, `OK, City Council,
we've forgotten you in the past but we'll come along and pick you up
now,''' Doyle said. ``I think we'll have to wait and see.''

   A 30-year-old masterpiece of fraternity
prankdom, the Smoot marks on Harvard Bridge, will not pass into
history after all, officials supervising the renovation of the
bridge say.
   Back in October 1958, Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity brothers at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology measured the bridge by using
the 5-foot-7 frame of pledge Oliver Reed Smoot Jr. as a yardstick.
   The bridge was found to be precisely 364.4 Smoots and one ear
long.
   Ever since, people crossing the Charles River over the
Massachusetts Avenue bridge have been able to measure their progress
in 10-Smoot intervals, painted on the sidewalk. The fraternity has
repainted the marks twice a year.
   But new construction was erasing the marks. Smoot, now 48 and the
executive vice president of a Washington, D.C.-based trade
association, expressed optimism, but others worried that the Smoot
would soon be moot as a unit of measure.
   Now, officials at the Metropolitan District Commission say that
though they normally frown on defacing public property, the Smoots
will stay.
   Just how they will be replaced is still under discussion.
Possibilities include bronze bars of official Smoot length, or a
Smoot-long section of the original painted concrete that would be
embedded in the new bridge. Fraternity members also vow to maintain
the tradition, saying they have carefully measured the Smoot-length
and will repaint the new bridge.
   Last spring, some students proposed re-Smooting the bridge using
Smoot's son, Stephen R. Smoot, a junior at MIT this year. But
fraternity members demurred. The son is 4 inches taller than his
dad, and besides, there's no Smoot like an old Smoot.

   When Bob Lash learned the name of his new
roommate after entering the hospital to recover from a heart attack,
he thought it sounded familiar.
   ``Is that the Gehrls from Fitzhugh Street?'' Lash, 79, asked
hospital officials at the time after hearing the name Harry Gehrls.
``I haven't seen him since 1954.''
   Gehrls, now 78, and Lash attended elementary school, junior high
and Saginaw High School together before graduating in 1927. They saw
each other only once afterward, 35 years ago, until Jan. 26, when
Lash was admitted to St. Luke's Hospital and was assigned Room 366.
   Like Lash, Gehrls was recovering from a second heart attack.
   The two said they passed time by recalling former teachers,
classmates, hangouts and their careers at General Motors Corp., from
which each retired in 1970.
   ``After everyone goes, we talk until midnight,'' Gehrls said.
``He remembers something I didn't, so we have to talk about it.''
   ``We've been doing some cackling,'' Lash said. ``You know, we've
been on some of those oxygen highs.''
   Lash went home Wednesday, and Gehrls is due to get out early this
week.
   ``Neither one of us expected to have this kind of meeting,''
Gehrls said. ``But when we get out of this place, we're going to get
together.''

<HEAD>White Liberals Announce New Political Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a bid for unity among white
liberals, three anti-apartheid political parties announced Saturday
they have merged in anticipation of national elections this year.
   The formation of the new party, to be known as the Democratic
Party, is an attempt to broaden the political base of white
liberals, who are widely seen as being in a state of disarray.
   The party will be launched formally in Johannesburg on April 8,
but ``concerted planning and action begin today,'' the organization
said Saturday after a meeting.
   The Democratic Party will have three leaders who presently are
serving as the heads of the merging parties.
   They are Zac de Beer of the Progressive Federal Party, Wynand
Malan of the National Democratic Movement, and Denis Worrall of the
Independent Party.
   The Progressive Federal Party currently has 17 of the 178 seats
in the white chamber of Parliament, while the National Democratic
Movement has three and the Independent Party none.
   The National Party, which has ruled South Africa 40 years,
maintains firm control of the white chamber with 133 seats, while
the extreme-right Conservative Party is the official opposition with
24 seats. A small independent party holds the 178th seat.
   South Africa's Parliament has separate houses for whites, Asians
and people of mixed-race, but not for the majority 26 million blacks.
   The liberal white parties draw their support almost exclusively
from the major urban areas such as Johannesburg, Cape Town and
Durban, but they have been losing some support in recent years.
   The three merging parties all oppose apartheid and their
platforms are largely similar.
   They said they hope to attract whites who traditionally vote for
the National Party but who have become disillusioned by its
start-and-stop race reform.
   ``Our immediate objectives are the consolidation of existing
membership, the recruitment of those many South Africans ... who are
looking for a new political home, and the achievement of support and
credibility across the political spectrum,'' the Democratic Party
said Saturday.
   In 1987, Malan resigned from the National Party to form the
National Democratic Movement and Worrall quit as South Africa's
ambassador to Britain to form the Independent Party. Both men cited
disappointment with the government's slow pace of reform.
   The government must call an election before March 1990, and most
observers believe it will be scheduled sometime this year.
   In neighboring Zimbabwe, a group of white South African lawyers
and black officials of the African National Congress ended a meeting
Saturday with a call for the formation of a multiparty democracy in
South Africa.
   A communique released jointly by 30 South Africa-based attorneys
and law academics and about 15 exiled ANC officials said a consensus
was reached that there is a need to create conditions so South
Africa's whites and blacks have equal rights.
   It was the first meeting between white law academics and leaders
of the ANC, the largest guerrilla organization fighting the South
African government.

   Moslem insurgents surround the key
city of Jalalabad and will launch a major attack on it if the
communist defenders do not surrender soon, guerrilla leaders said
Saturday.
   The leaders decided at a meeting at Ghazi Abad, about 15 miles
outside Jalalabad, to press their siege of the city so that no
supplies get through to Afghan army forces.
   The insurgents said Jalalabad, about 90 miles east of the Afghan
capital of Kabul, could be the first major city to fall after the
Soviets complete their military withdrawal from the nation.
   Jalalabad's fall would weaken the defenses of Kabul and open up
the highway to the capital, the guerrillas said.
   Abdul Zaher, a senior commander of the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla
group, said the insurgents do not want to attack the crowded city
for fear of injuring civilians.
   But the guerrillas will have no choice if Afghan troops attempt
to hold out, and an assault could come within 10 days, Zaher said.
   The guerrilla forces are moving to take control of Afghanistan
when the Soviets complete their pullout. Under a U.N.-mediated
accord, the Red Army is suposed to be out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   It entered the country in 1979 to back Afghan troops in their war
with Moslem guerrillas.
   Occasional artillery fire from government forces outside
Jalalabad could be heard Saturday, but guerrillas appeared in
control of the surrounding countryside.
   Trucks and buses filled with heavily armed insurgents moved up
the highways leading to the city, and Zaher said up to 12,000
guerrillas surrounded Jalalabad.
   He said there were an undetermined but much smaller number of
Afghan troops and that they were demoralized.
   ``There are only a few communists who still want to fight,''
Zaher said.
   But the guerrillas did not appear to have artillery or other
heavy weapons they might need for a decisive attack. Jalalabad was a
major Soviet army and air base and reportedly has powerful defenses.
   The guerrillas plan to blockade supply routes and then expect
Jalalabad, Kabul and other cities to fall quickly.
   ``The fighting will end when the Russians withdraw, an Islamic
government is established and the communists surrender,'' Zaher said.
   Guerrilla forces have taken over and occupied all government army
bases and outposts along the main highway connecting Jalalabad to
the Pakistani border about 45 miles away.
   Burned out government tanks, armored personnel carriers and
trucks destroyed in fighting last month are strewn along the road.
   A large explosion Saturday near the guerrilla base at Ghazi Abad
was caused by a long-range rocket fired by government forces,
guerrillas said. There was no sign of Afghan air force planes and
the insurgents said there had been no air attacks in the area in
recent days.
   Some guerrilla leaders, fearing civilian casualties, have said
they do not want to launch major attacks on cities. But others said
privately that some of the seven rival Moslem groups are pressing
for quick action.
   After Jalalabad falls, the guerrillas there would reinforce the
insurgents at Kabul, Zaher said.
   He said the commanders of the guerrilla groups were cooperating
in taking Jalalabad and that plans were under way to run the city
and ensure the safety of civilians and property after its fall.
   Guerrilla officers also said appeals were being made at mosques
to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.
   ``We're fighting only the communists. Do not harm the good people
when we take Kabul, do not loot or kill,'' an Islamic mullah, or
priest, said in a sermon broadcast over loudspeakers Saturday in one
area held by insurgents.
   Some Western aid officials and Afghans have expressed fears of
bloodshed, reprisals and looting by vengeful guerrillas.
   ``We don't want any bad things to happen,'' Zaher said.

   More than one ton of herbal ointments are being
used to preserve the body of the late Panchen Lama, the official
Xinhua News Agency said Saturday.
   Xinhua said the preservatives included borneol, sandalwood powder
and safflowers.
   It said 1,220 pounds of preservatives were delivered by car to
the Tashi Lump Monastery in Xigaze, Tibet, where the Panchen Lama
died Jan. 28.
   The Panchen Lama was the second-highest ranking leader in Tibetan
Buddhism, behind the exiled Dalai Lama. He died of a heart attack at
age 50, and the government has said it will build a shrine to house
his body.
   Xinhua said several experienced monks had begun the preservation
procedure. It earlier said the body would be wrapped in fine silks
and satins and the face painted with golden powder after it is
preserved.
   Hundreds of monks and thousands of laity paid last respects to
the Panchen Lama in ceremonies in Xigaze and Lhasa on Friday. He was
revered as the 10th incarnation of the Buddhist god Amitabha.
   The government has indicated it will allow the selection of a
successor, which traditionally involves identifying a child believed
to be a new reincarnation.

   China's leading dissident, Fang Lizhi, took his
message straight to the establishment Saturday by telling a party
attended by hundreds of actors, scientists, and businessmen they
should work for human rights.
   ``Some people think China doesn't need democracy, but I think
human rights is basic,'' Fang said in a strong voice. Until his
speech, the tea party had been non-political with some guests
volunteering songs and stories.
   ``For (human rights) to be realized, first of all famous people
must take a stand,'' he told the audience, which included many local
leaders in the arts, science and trade.
   Fang and several other leading intellectuals were expelled from
the Communist Party in 1987 after nationwide student demonstrations
for democracy.
   More recently, authorities punished Fang for his outspokenness by
revoking his permission to spend six months this year at the
Colorado Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics.
   Fang, who is also known for his work as an astrophysicist, has
made many pro-democracy speech to groups of sympathizers,
particularly students.
   However, Saturday was the first time he took his message of
democracy and human rights to an establishment audience.
   The party at a local hotel was organized by the Chinese Cultural
Academy and Academy of Sciences' Entrepreneurial Association to
celebrate the upcoming Lunar New Year. Both groups are state-run.
   ``Some people came up to me afterward and said they agreed with
what I said,'' Fang said after his speech, which ended to tepid
applause. But he acknowledged that not everyone in the audience was
happy.
   ``I will speak out more in the future to such groups,'' Fang
said. ``I think there will be more and more discussions among
intellectuals ... because the government right now is very weak due
to economic problems. Even inside the party, they can't agree on
things.''
   China is trying to control inflation of more than 20 percent,
shortages of energy and raw materials, and growing corruption.

<HEAD>International Aid Fund For Northern Ireland Revamped In Wake Of Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international fund designed to promote peace
in Northern Ireland through economic revitalization has been
overhauled following criticism that some of the money was given to
programs such as a parachute club, a congressman says.
   The International Fund for Ireland, an outgrowth of the 1985
Anglo-Irish pact, sought to ease the two decades of violence between
Catholics and Protestants in British-ruled Northern Ireland by
improving economic conditions, thereby reducing deep-seeded
resentments.
   The fund, run by an independent commission appointed jointly by
Britain and the republic of Ireland, fuels economic projects across
Northern Ireland and in border counties in the republic, areas where
both tensions and unemployment run rampant.
   The program got off the ground in 1986 largely due to a
three-year, $120 million U.S. aid package pushed personally by two
of America's most famous Irishmen, Ronald Reagan and then-House
Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., D-Mass.
   But concern has grown over how the agency is doling out the money.
   ``Up until this point, the policy of the fund has been to spread
the money around, take what I call a scatter-gun approach to it,
under the theory that all areas in Northern Ireland and the border
counties have been affected by the troubles. And that's true,'' said
Rep. Brian J. Donnelly, D-Mass. ``But the reality is some areas have
been affected more than others.''
   Some of the projects backed by International Fund grants have
been praised, such as the creation of an industrial park for
fledgling businessmen near the Protestant-Catholic divide in Belfast.
   But others have come under sharp criticism, including the
refurbishing of a bank, which later returned the grant, and aid for
a parachute school, which fund officials said was given to help
promote tourism and lift the local economy.
   More importantly, according to Donnelly, some Catholic
nationalists who oppose British rule of Northern Ireland felt they
were being excluded from the program. The money, he said, was not
always going to the neediest areas.
   Donnelly, an O'Neill protege who has led the fight in Congress
for Irish aid since the House speaker retired two years ago, met
with fund officials in Ireland last month and was told the system
recently has been revamped.
   The fund now will target grants to areas most adversely affected
by the violence and economic depression, such as West Belfast, he
said.
   Fund managers also have hired their own staff to help nationalist
communities apply for grants.
   ``My position has been that if mistakes have been made, and I
think some have, I think the fund managers have learned from them
and let's wait and see what the next go-round of grants bring,''
Donnelly said in an interview last week.
   Donnelly, chairman of the Friends of Ireland caucus in Congress,
and other leading proponents of Irish aid, including Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., and his nephew, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II,
D-Mass., are prepared to push for more money for the fund this year.
   Sen. Kennedy said he was optimistic Congress would continue to
support the fund despite the criticism.
   ``Encouraging economic development is one of the most effective
roles that the United States can play in ending the conflict,'' the
senator said.
   But U.S. financing for the program has remained a tenuous
proposition since the three-year package ran its course last year.
Levels that had averaged $40 million a year for the first three
years were reduced to about $10 million last year. Donnelly and
Irish officials attribute the decrease to budget constraints within
Congress rather than a dissatisfaction with the program, but others
say criticisms of the program are expected to result in it being
carefully scrutinized on Capitol Hill this year.
   Donnelly predicts Congress will continue to fund the program, but
concedes it was never a State Department favorite.
   ``Ronald Reagan personally supported it, but I think within the
bureaucracy (at State) there has been less than enthusiasm,'' he
said.
   The current Reagan budget, as the previous one, proposed no money
for the Irish fund.

<HEAD>Recommendation To End Combat Bonus Signals Peace In Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: CORRECTS byline.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general in charge of the U.S. Central
Command has recommended suspension of combat pay for sailors in the
Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources say.
   The recommendation, under review by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is
the strongest indication yet that American defense officials believe
the truce between Iran and Iraq may hold.
   The ``imminent danger'' bonuses, previously known as hostile fire
or combat pay, are worth $110 a month and have been paid to
servicemen working inside the Persian Gulf since August 1987.
   Precise figures were not available last week, but Navy officials
estimated 4,000 servicemen were receiving the payments. At that
rate, the Pentagon would save $440,000 a month by dropping them.
   The defense sources insisted, however, that the recommendation
had nothing to do with budget concerns.
   According to the officials, who declined to be identified by
name, the recommendation was forwarded to Adm. William Crowe,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ``within the last month or so.
   It came from Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who assumed command of
the U.S. Central Command last November and ``believes the threat has
now receded to the point'' where it is difficult to justify the
payments, said one source.
   ``And the fact that we've gone to a different regime _ one of
monitoring ship traffic instead of actually escorting tankers
directly _ changes things, too,'' the source added.
   Another source said the staff that serves the nation's highest
council of military officers ``is hard at work reviewing the
recommendation and its ramifications.''
   ``A final position should be presented to (Crowe) within the next
month, but there doesn't appear to be any reason to maintain the
payments,'' the source said.
   The Central Command is the organization responsible for American
military operations in the Middle East and Indian Ocean region. As
such, it is the parent command for the Joint Task Force Middle East,
the unit responsible for guaranteeing the safety of merchant ships
flying the U.S. flag in the Persian Gulf.
   The administration of former President Reagan agreed in the
spring of 1987 to extend American military protection to 11 Kuwaiti
tankers after they switched to U.S. registry. Kuwait, a friend of
the United States and a key ally of Iraq, had found that its ships
had become special targets for Iranian forces.
   In August 1987, one month after the first U.S.-escorted Kuwaiti
tanker ran into an underwater mine, the Pentagon announced it would
start making the payments to the crews of warships operating inside
the Persian gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and a small portion of the
Gulf of Oman, as well as to personnel stationed in Kuwait and
Bahrain.
   Iran and Iraq agreed to a truce last August in their bloody,
8-year-old war and the cease-fire has held. As a result, the United
States has slowly reduced the number of warships operating in the
region and stopped conducting closely supervised convoy runs.
   Instead, the ships now in the region maintain what the Navy calls
a ``monitoring regime'' of keeping U.S.-flaged tankers within radar
or radio range.
   The United States now has 14 ships inside the Gulf, including six
small mine-sweepers.
   According to the Pentagon sources, even if Schwarzkopf's
recommendation is approved, some minor exceptions might be made to
continue the payments to the sailors on the mine-sweepers. Those men
are still actively engaged each day in hunting for floating mines,
the officials noted.
   The authority to make imminent danger payments was provided to
the Pentagon in 1983 under an amendment to a law that had previously
established procedures for providing hostile fire, or combat, pay.
   The new law specified that danger pay could be provided to
servicemen deployed in areas where there was a risk of terrorism or
other physical threats, even though American forces were not
directly involved in combat.

<TEXT>
   A 14-year-old boy was shot to death by a friend
after a roll of the dice led to a quarrel over a dime, police said.
   Javonda Bethly, a high school freshman, was shot in the head
Thursday evening and died Friday.
   A 16-year-old boy was taken sobbing from the scene of the
shooting and was questioned by police, Lt. David Bruess said. The
boy told officers that Bethly owed him a dime from a dice game, and
that the pistol went off accidentally.
   ``He said he wished he was dead,'' Bruess said. ``He wished it
was him. I told him to try to calm down and said it was a little
late to think about that.''
   Police held the 16-year-old at the Children's Detention Center,
pending a review by the district attorney's office.
   Bethly and another teen-age boy were playing dice in the den in
the home of the boy with the gun, Bruess said.
   The 16-year-old pulled out an old .22-caliber pistol he had found
when Bethly and the other boy refused to pay dimes they lost on a
roll of dice, Bruess said.
   ``He pulls out the gun and was flashing it around,'' Bruess said.
``He threatened to kill them if they didn't pay up.''
   One boy surrendered his dime, but Bethly refused. The gun went
off accidentally, the older boy told police.
   The grandmother of the 16-year-old said she was sure the shooting
was accidental.
   ``They were both born in my house and grew up together,'' she
said. ``I don't think they'd get mad enough at each other to do
something like that.''

   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson says
his divorce from actress Robin Givens is just a signature away.
   ``I've signed the divorce papers. She's on vacation and when she
comes back and signs them, we'll be legally divorced,'' Tyson said
Friday on ``The Arsenio Hall Show,'' a syndicated talk show.
   Financial terms of the possible settlement weren't disclosed.
   Tyson's attorney, Howard Weitzman said that Givens' attorney,
Raoul Felder, assured him earlier Friday that she would sign the
papers Sunday, either in Los Angeles or New York.
   Weitzman said Givens was out of the country. The 23-year-old
actress, a co-star on the ABC comedy series ``Head of the Class,''
refused to sign a similar divorce decree in December.
   Givens married Tyson, 22, last February and filed for divorce in
early October, saying the champion had physically abused her and
their marriage was ``a continuous horror story.''
   Tyson is scheduled to defend his undisputed crown against British
champion Frank Bruno on Feb. 25 at the Las Vegas Hilton.

<HEAD>Same Judge, Same Legal Dilemmas in North Trial and Watergate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The intense publicity, the fight over secret
documents, the legal dilemmas posed at the trial of Oliver North
rouse memories of a celebrated Watergate trial at which U.S.
District Judge Gerhard Gesell also presided.
   As he began jury selection last week in the trial of the former
White House aide, the white-haired judge with the no-nonsense manner
followed procedures he used more than 14 years ago for the so-called
Plumbers trial.
   A defendant in that case was an aide from an earlier White House
_ John Ehrlichman, former chief domestic adviser to Richard M. Nixon.
   Courtroom No. 6 on the second floor of the U.S. District
Courthouse was the scene of that trial, as it is the North trial.
   There are other similarities.
   Like North, Ehrlichman was a prodigious note-taker who contended
his files were essential to his defense.
   Like North, Ehrlichman had starred on television as a featured
witness at hearings watched by millions of Americans.
   Like North, Ehrlichman's role in a White House scandal was the
subject of front-page stories that intrigued a nation for months
before his case came to trial.
   Despite the torrent of publicity, it took Gesell just two days to
seat a jury for the Plumbers trial _ named for the White House unit
established to plug leaks of classified information. Only three
potential jurors were dismissed because they said they doubted they
could render an impartial verdict.
   But the North trial presents Gesell with a problem he didn't face
14 years ago. Ehrlichman didn't have immunity when he testified
before the Senate Watergate committee. North did have a guarantee
his testimony before the congressional Iran-Contra committee
couldn't be used against him.
   Dozens of prospective jurors have been dismissed from the North
trial because they said they heard North testify to Congress that he
committed crimes.
   The search for an untainted jury in the North trial ``is
exacerbated by the immunity,'' said Richard Ben-Veniste, one of the
Watergate prosecutors.
   ``This case has more problems than any I've ever seen,'' said
Ben-Veniste, who played a leading role in the trial of former Nixon
administration officials convicted on charges stemming from the
break-in at Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate office
building.
   What has struck some observers of the North trial is the search
for people who had no curiosity about the Iran-Contra scandal when
it was unfolding in televised hearings.
   ``Whether they will differ from normal, average jurors remains to
be seen,'' said Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., a former state supreme
court judge who served on the Iran-Contra committee. ``If a man
never saw anything of it, what type of individual is he?''
   ``I wouldn't want people who lived in Washington, the seat of
government, on that jury who were so uninformed,'' said Bill
Moffitt, a criminal defense attorney.
   The magnitude of Gesell's problem was illustrated by the case of
a prospective juror disqualified because she worked at a Sears
Roebuck store where dozens of TV sets were turned on when North
testified in July 1987.
   The woman has not watched the testimony, but her exposure to it
was such that the judge decided to remove her from the panel of
potential jurors.
   Documents are another common issue.
   In both cases, Gesell made extraordinary appeals to the
president, but the tone of each was quite different.
   In the North case, Gesell urged President Reagan to decide
whether massive amounts of classified information North contended
was vital to his defense could be released.
   ``The court has a very limited role,'' said Gesell, adding that
the Constitution provides that it is up to the president ``not North
or any witness, to protect the prerogatives of the president's
office if he deems them unduly threatened.''
   North had sought some 40,000 pages of documents.
   When the president refused to release material _ saying ``these
are things that are national security secrets'' _ conspiracy charges
against North were dropped.
   Gesell never implied he thought the White House was withholding
material simply to block prosecution of the man Reagan had once
referred to as ``a national hero.''
   The judge's attitude was very different when he came into
conflict with the Nixon White House over Ehrlichman's request to
have access to his files.
   When the White House said that only the defendant, not his
lawyer, would be allowed into the room where the files were kept,
Gesell responded scathingly.
   ``I don't see how I can agree to a procedure that is so totally
offensive,'' he said.
   ``It is offensive, sir, it borders on obstruction,'' he told
James St. Clair, the lawyer representing Nixon at various
proceedings then underway to examine the president's role in
Watergate.

   Pay raises for members of Congress, federal
judges and top government officials is expected to take effect next
week. Here is a chronology of the events surrounding the
controversial pay hike.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Dec. 13, 1988:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries
recommends 50 percent pay raises for members of Congress, federal
judges and top government officials. Salaries for lawmakers and
judges would increase from $89,500 to $135,000. The vice president's
salary would go from $115,000 to $175,000.
   The advisory panel also suggests that Congress enact legislation
raising the president's annual salary from $200,000 to $350,000, an
increase that would take effect on Jan. 21, 1993. The Constitution
bans raising a president's pay during his term.
   The commission also recommends that Congress pass legislation to
abolish honoraria, the speaking and writing fees paid to lawmakers
primarily by special-interest groups.
   The commission chairman, Lloyd Cutler, notes that the
government's top 3,000 or so workers are paid less than professional
athletes and cites a list of major league baseball salaries. Even
``.200-hitting utility infielders, receive more than a district
court judge or member of Congress or a deputy secretary of state,''
Cutler says.

<NOTE>Jan. 6, 1989:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Then-President Reagan endorses the pay-raise recommendations,
saying ``fair compensation for those who bear the responsibility for
effective functioning of our government is critical at this juncture
of history.'' With Reagan's endorsement, the raises will go into
effect unless both houses of Congress reject them by Feb. 8.

<HEAD>Groups Call For Peaceful Jamaican Election</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jamaica's 10,000 soldiers and police
officers voted Saturday so they will be free to maintain order
during the parliamentary election later this week. Civic groups
called for peaceful balloting.
   Eight people have reportedly been shot or hacked to death in
political violence between supporters of rival parties since Prime
Minister Edward Seaga launched the campaign Jan. 15.
   Thursday will be the first nationally contested election since
1980, when 700 people were killed in political violence over a
nine-month campaign.
   More than 3,000 members of the Jamaica Defense Force and 7,000
members of the Constabulary Force voted Saturday in special polling
stations across this Caribbean island of 2.3 million.
   Security forces traditionally vote several days before elections
to devote themselves to maintaining order on election day.
   Seaga on Friday signed an order calling into service hundreds of
army reservists to assist security forces in maintaining order
during the week before balloting.
   Twenty private sector and civic groups are calling on ``all good
people in this country'' to wear blue from Monday to Thursday next
week in support of peace, the groups' spokesman, Peter John
Thwaites, said Friday.
   ``We are asking the churches to take this call to their
congregations,'' he said. ``Wear something blue to show that you are
for peace; a blue garment, a blue ribbon, a blue tassel.''
   All 60 seats in Parliament will be contested Thursday.
   Seaga's conservative Jamaica Labor Party won all the seats in a
1983 election boycotted by the leftist opposition People's National
Party, led by former Prime Minister Michael Manley. He called for
the boycott after learning that only four days were allowed for
nomination of candidates.
   Seaga and Manley are the two main candidates Thursday.

<HEAD>Steel Employees Get Closing Notice; But Jobs Still Leaving</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fritz Wagner once lost a job with less than
a week's notice, so he appreciated getting two months' warning of
the closing of Lehigh Structural Steel Co.'s fabricating plant.
   That notice under a new federal law is only so much help, though.
   ``You're out of a job no matter how you look at it,'' Wagner, 23,
said Friday in a drizzle at the lunch truck outside the 70-year-old
factory.
   Lehigh Structural Steel President R. Leslie Mullen, citing
inability to compete in the Northeast with Canadian companies,
announced Jan. 24 that the company would shut down most of its
Allentown operations permanently by March 24, putting about 185 of
225 employees out of work.
   A new law that took effect Saturday requires companies with 100
or more full-time employees to give 60 days' notice of plant
closings or major layoffs. Under some interpretations of the law,
Lehigh had to give notice even before the Feb. 4 effective date, and
the company provided it.
   ``It's not like you can come in one day and the doors are
locked,'' Wagner said. The notice, he said, means ``now we've got a
chance'' to look for other jobs.
   A union official said that notice may not be a big help for many
of his members, but said company officials have been straightforward.
   ``They're abiding by the plant-closing law. They've been really
cooperative,'' secretary-treasurer John Kontier of Local 548 of the
International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental
Ironworkers union.
   The law doesn't require that each employee receives 60 days'
notice, because some employees may be laid off before a plant closes
entirely.
   ``They just said the plant's shutting down. Then I got a
three-day layoff notice,'' said John Shelby, a punch operator at the
plant for five years who was one of seven or eight workers laid off
Friday. He said he thought he should have received more notice.
   Even with 60 days' notice, job counseling under way and
retraining to start soon, Kontier said, the law may not get his
members quickly back to work. He said they will first search in vain
for jobs that pay near the steel plant's average $10 to $11 an hour,
plus benefits including health insurance.
   He wants to see more government efforts to keep companies in
business, particularly in making sure foreign companies don't get an
unfair advantage in markets.
   But those would be too late for this company. Gradual layoffs
began in January and one fabricating shop closed a week ago, with
another scheduled to close this week, said plant superintendent Ken
Weiss, who at 59 will be looking for a job himself.
   By the target closing date of the entire plant in April, the last
shop will have finished the remaining steelwork for a 41-story
building in New York. Weiss said about 30 employees will be needed
for the last stage.
   The shutdown plans surprised Wagner, who began work at the plant
last May. He liked the idea of the new law, but little did he know
as politicians fussed over its passage last year that it would
affect him.
   ``I had no feeling at all. When I started in May, I thought my
job was set,'' said Wagner, who bought a house last September and
was married in October. ``I thought I could retire here.''
   ``My whole family worked here,'' he said. ``My grandfather was
here when they opened the plant.''

<HEAD>GAO Says Problems With New Bomber Persist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major problems still plaguing the B-1B bomber
may reduce its expected range and payload capability, says a report
issued by Congress' investigative arm.
   The General Accounting Office concluded in its report that
although the Air Force has made progress in correcting certain
deficiencies in the Rockwell-built bomber, problems in the bomber's
performance persist.
   ``Several areas critical to B-1B's mission performance have not
yet been demonstrated,'' the report said.
   The review also said the cost of the Air Force plane could be up
to $400 million each if the service goes ahead with all the planned
improvements.
   Those problems mean the B-1B may not have the range it was
designed to have or be able to carry all the bombs and missiles
planned for it, the report said.
   The bomber is designed to carry conventional and nuclear gravity
bombs, cruise missiles and short-range attack missiles.
   Specifically, the report said the Air Force has not made progress
in resolving problems with the B-1B's defensive avionics. ``In
short, it is now known that the defensive avionics cannot meet
specifications without a major redesign,'' the report said.
   The defensive avionics, or electronic countermeasures system, was
designed to improve the bomber's probability of penetrating the
Soviet Union by allowing the aircraft's crew to ``avoid, degrade and
deceive the Soviet air defenses,'' the report said.
   The problems involve the system's radar warning receiver and
processor function.
   The report also said that data for the bomber indicate that
reported fuel leaks have for the most part remained the same over
the last year. Elimination of the fuel leaks is probably not
possible, according to the report, which noted that the fuel cells
are part of the airframe and seals and joints are subjected to
flight stress.
   The B-1, killed by then-President Carter in 1977, was resurrected
four years later by former President Reagan, who said 100 of the
swing-wing planes were needed to update the nation's aging force of
nuclear-armed bombers.
   Reagan ordered 100 of the planes, at a cost of $20.5 billion.
Three have crashed, leaving the service with 97 B-1Bs. The Air Force
has already received all the B-1s it intends to buy and is now
proceeding with plans to buy the radar-evading B-2 stealth bomber.

<HEAD>Soviets Learn Shocking Figure that 40 Million Repressed Under Stalin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number Soviets have wondered about for more
than 30 years appeared in print Saturday: more than 40 million
arrested, killed or otherwise repressed in the bloody political
terror of Josef Stalin.
   In the most detailed account of Stalin's victims reported in the
Soviet press, the weekly tabloid Arguments and Facts said 15 million
people died because of the dictator who took power in 1924.
   Its article came as a daily newspaper reported bullet-fractured
skulls were found in what may be a mass grave of Stalin's victims.
   Although figures on Stalin's victims have been known to
Westerners, Soviets have not seen them published officially. Almost
every Soviet living today had relatives who suffered under Stalin,
and since his death in 1953 they have hoped to put a number on the
human toll.
   Historian Roy Medvedev gave the 40 million figure to Arguments
and Facts and said it included all ``victims of Stalinism'' based on
his own calculations.
   The toll was much higher than previous vague estimates.
   In 1987, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said ``many thousands
of people ... were subjected to wholesale repressive measures''
under Stalin.
   Western historians believe 20 million Soviets died under Stalin.
The same number of Soviets were killed in World War II.
   Medvedev said 6 million to 7 million people were killed in an
early 1930s famine, 5 million to 7 million were executed or died in
labor camps after mass arrests in the late 1930s, and 1 million died
during forced relocations of ethnic minorities during World War II.
   Also Saturday, the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya reported
construction workers discovered a mass grave Jan. 19 in Gorno-Altai,
1,900 miles southeast of Moscow. Human remains they found include 50
skulls of men 30 to 50 years old who were shot through the temple or
back of the head, it said.
   Before World War II, a greenhouse and vegetable storage facility
were on the site, next to a camp for political prisoners run by the
dreaded NKVD secret police, the newspaper said. Investigating
prosecutor I. Gushchina told the newspaper: ``One thing is clear: a
tragedy happened here.''
   Sovietskaya Rossiya likened the killing field to one found last
year in Kuropaty, in the Byelorussian republic. Authorities said
that field is a mass graveyard for at least 30,000 people killed
from 1937-1941, apparently for political reasons.
   Medvedev, a dissident historian who recently has received
official backing, gave Arguments and Facts this breakdown for
Stalin's victims:
   _From 1927-1929, about 1 million Soviets were jailed or in exile.
Most were former members of political opposition groups and figures
in Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin's New Economic Policy.
   _From 1930-1932, 9-11 million peasants were deported to Siberia
and other remote regions or fled to cities when Stalin forced
collectivization of Soviet agriculture. At least 1 million more
peasants were deported in 1933.
   _From 1932-1933, 6 million to 7 million people died in a famine
blamed on Stalin's policies.
   _About 1.5 million to 2 million other peasants were arrested for
violating ``extremely cruel'' laws on state property.
   _In 1935, 1 million former officials, merchants and nobelmen were
branded ``class strangers'' and deported from Leningrad, Moscow and
other cities.
   _Five million to 7 million people were arrested in the ``Great
Terror'' of 1937-38. One million of them were sentenced to death.
The rest were sent to labor camps, where most died.
   _Mass repressions struck 1 million people from 1939-1941 in the
Baltic republics and western sections of the Ukraine and Byelorussia.
   _During World War II, up to 2 million ethnic Germans were
deported. About 3 million Moslems were forced to move. A million of
those deported died.
   _After 1940, 2 million to 3 million people were arrested for
reporting late to work, a crime punishable by up to five years in a
labor camp.
   _From 10 million to 12 million Soviets were deprived of certain
rights or sent to labor camps because they lived in areas the Nazis
occupied during the war.
   _Between 1 million and 1.5 million people were arrested 1946-53
for political reasons.
   Medvedev was expelled from the Communist Party in 1969 and his
major works on Stalin's repressions and other once-taboo topics were
banned from publication. Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost or
openness, he is back in favor.

   George Morgenstern paid his traffic fine
and gave a little something extra _ an obscene note complaining
about the parking ticket.
   Now he is suing the city for $1.8 million, saying his free speech
rights were violated when he was arrested for scrawling the
obscenity on the traffic ticket.
   ``There were no (expletive) signs posted anywhere,'' Morgenstern
had written on the $12 ticket in June 1987.
   Morgenstern filed a lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court seeking
$1 million in punitive damages and $800,000 in compensatory damages
from Rochester and Lester Roden, city parking violations enforcement
supervisor. Roden had Morgenstern arrested for second-degree
harassment a few weeks after he paid the parking ticket.
   The harassment charge was dismissed Aug. 10, 1988, by City Court
Judge William H. Bristol, who wrote: ``We who work in government ...
must expect that a certain disdain for government will be expressed
to us by citizens. After all, we are employed by these citizens.
They are our sovereigns.''

<HEAD>Moslems March in Soviet Republic to Press Religious Demands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 Soviet Moslems marched from a mosque
through the Uzbek capital of Tashkent to press the government to
take up their religious demands, Tass reported Saturday.
   The official news agency said the demonstrators from the Central
Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan demanded
state intervention in certain religious matters. However, Tass did
not elaborate.
   ``Slogans of the group were of strictly religious character,'' it
said.
   The march occurred Friday after a crowded service at a Tashkent
mosque, Tass said. It said the Moslems disrupted traffic and police
restored order without using force during the three-hour gathering.
   Tass said Uzbek Premier Gairat Kadyrov met with 25 of the
demonstrators and told them their demands should be addressed by the
clergy, not the government. Regional religious leaders were to
discuss the demands Monday, Tass said.
   In a country whose government espouses atheism, the population
includes an estimated 45 million to 50 million Moslems, the largest
minority after ethnic Russians.
   The Moslems are increasing in number much more rapidly than
ethnic Russians, who hold the reins of political power. Based on
current trends, the Moslem population will rise to 100 million by
the year 2000, meaning one in every three Soviets will be Moslem.
   The Kremlin has expressed concern that Islamic fundamentalism
across the border in Afghanistan and Iran could spread to Soviet
Moslems.

   Two tremors on Saturday rocked the area of
Tadzhikistan where an earthquake and mudslide killed 274 people last
month, Tass reported. No damage or injuries were reported.
   Also Saturday, the official news agency said a high-level
commission was unhappy with reconstruction of the area of Armenia
devastated by a Dec. 7 quake that killed an estimated 25,000 people.
   Tass said two tremors measuring 4 on the 12-point Soviet scale
jolted the area of Gissar in Tadzhikistan, 1,800 miles southeast of
Moscow in Soviet Central Asia. On Friday, tremors of 4 and 2-3
points were reported, it said.
   A tremor of 4 points can shake objects such as dishes and windows
and cause doors and walls to creak.
   A 40-second earthquake struck Tadzhikistan on Jan. 23, loosening
layers of mud that tumbled through mountain villages 20 miles
southwest of the republic's capital, Dushanbe.
   In the Armenian capital, Yerevan, a commission of the country's
ruling Politburo met Saturday and lashed out at construction
officials for dragging their feet in rebuilding the city of Spitak,
Tass reported. The commission said the delays could seriously set
back rebuilding plans.
   Spitak was one of the hardest hit areas by the December
earthquake, and the town is to be rebuilt several miles away from
its current location. The current location is right at the
convergence of three earthquake faults.
   The Kremlin has promised to rebuild northwestern Armenia in two
years.
   The panel said that to speed reconstruction, it was ordering
increases in local production of building materials such as sand,
stone and gravel.
   Tass said the sanitary and health conditions in the disaster area
remained poor. It said the danger of epidemics will increase as
spring approaches and the weather warms up.

   Angola freed nine anti-government
guerrillas from jail in an amnesty that began Saturday, a Portuguese
news agency said.
   The amnesty is aimed at U.S.-backed rebels from the National
Union for Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA. It affects
Angolans living both inside Angola and abroad.
   However, the rebels have rejected the amnesty and pledged to keep
up their 13-year war against their country's leftist government.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said the rebels were released
from a jail in the Angolan capital, Luanda.
   It did not say how long they were imprisoned or what the charges
were.
   The rebels have also rejected U.S.-brokered peace accords signed
in December by Angola, South Africa and Cuba.
   Under the pacts, South Africa pledged to cut off aid to the
Angolan rebels and grant independence to neighboring Namibia. In
return, about 50,000 pro-government Cuban troops in Angola have
begun a phased withdrawal.
   The United States has promised to support UNITA until the Soviet
Union ends aid to the Angolan government.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh vowed Saturday
to take a ``rougher, tougher attitude'' toward violent drug
traffickers to achieve President Bush's goal of a ``kindler, gentler
America.''
   In a speech prepared for delivery to the American Judicature
Society and the National Conference of Bar Presidents meeting in
Denver, Thornburgh decried the number of drug-related murders in
American cities, notably in the nation's capital where 60 percent of
the 369 killings last year were narcotics related.
   ``Firm and effective action against drug-related criminal
activities, including application of the newly-enacted federal death
penalty will be necessary to end the `free-fire' zones that have
taken the lives of innocent people, including an increasing number
of young people,'' Thornburg said.
   ``Achieving President Bush's `kindler, gentler America' will
require a `rougher, tougher' attitude toward some Americans _ those
who engage in crimes of violence associated with the drug trade and
with urban terrorism,'' he said.
   An advance copy of the speech was released in Washington.

   A band of kidnappers on

said.
   One official who helped negotiate the release refused to say if
any ransom was paid. The group had initially demanded $25,000 but
later lowered it to $7,500.
   Councilor Edmundo Rodriguez said the six captives were released
on the outskirts of this city, 540 miles southeast of Manila, at 1
a.m. and rushed to a hospital to be examined.
   There was no immediate word on their conditions.
   Felix Rosario, vice president of the Family Planning Organization

12 as they were returning from an inspection of some projects.
   Rodriguez said authorities expected only five hostages to be
released but when they arrived at the turnover site, they found that
the kidnappers had also released a busineswoman kidnapped Dec. 2.

   Israeli troops shot and killed two Palestinian
teen-agers in the Gaza Strip on Saturday in one of the bloodiest
clashes in the Palestinian uprising in several weeks.
   A Red Cross worker also was wounded in the confrontation in the
crowded Khan Younis refugee camp, the first international relief
worker to be hurt in the 14-month uprising.
   Arab hospital officials said at least 23 protesters were wounded
in the camp. Six other Palestinians were shot in scattered clashes
throughout the southern Gaza Strip, and one was shot in the West
Bank town of Qalqilya, Arab reporters and hospital officials said.
   The army spokesman confirmed the two deaths but said only 16 were
wounded, all in the refugee camp.
   The army imposed a curfew on the Khan Younis camp and ordered its
35,000 residents to stay in their homes until further notice.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, 373 Palestinians and 15
Israelis have been killed.
   The boys killed Saturday were identified as 15-year-old Allah
Abdullah Arandez and 16-year-old Maged Jawdat Ihlak.
   A military spokesman said troops had no choice but to open fire
with plastic bullets to disperse a group of women and masked youths
who surrounded their lookout point and attacked it with rocks.
   Arandez was shot in the chest and died after he was taken to the
camp's Nasser Hospital, an Arab reporter said.
   The reporter said Arandez was the second son in his family to be
killed in the revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied lands.
Sabri Abdullah Arandez, 26, was killed in clashes with troops in
November, the reporter said.
   The Arandez family snatched Allah Abdullah's body from the
hospital and hastily buried him, a common Palestinian practice aimed
at preventing the army from taking a body for an autopsy.
   Following Arandez's funeral, clashes broke out anew. Ihlak was
shot, and 23 other protesters were reportedly wounded.
   Ihlak died of a chest wound while undergoing surgery, Nasser
Hospital officials said.
   As troops fired tear gas and rubber and plastic bullets in an
attempt to disperse protesters, an International Red Cross worker
was shot in the leg, military and Red Cross officials said.
   Alexander Antonin, 30, who was helping in the evacuation of
wounded when he was struck by a plastic bullet.
   He arrived in Israel about 10 days ago, said Frederick Maurice,
head of the International Red Cross mission in Israel and the
occupied lands.
   ``He was in between the soldiers and the protesters,'' Maurice
said. ``There was also tear gas and it was difficult to see what was
going on.''
   He said the Red Cross regarded the incident as an accident.
   ``There was stone throwing on one side of the street and shooting
on the other. It was a bit of a mess,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle is back home from his
first foray abroad for the Bush administration, apparently with
neither great gaffes nor startling accomplishments to show for his
largely symbolic mission to Latin America.
   Quayle, meeting in Venezuela with world leaders at a presidential
inauguration, signaled Bush administration sensitivity to Latin
America and then went to El Salvador where he delivered a stern
human rights message to the U.S.-backed government.
   The Latins had waited with great curiosity to size up the new
vice president while his own countrymen watched to see how he would
handle his first major assignment from President Bush.
   Foreign service officials nervously hoped he would not live down
to campaign criticisms that he was not up to the job of vice
president.
   By many accounts from both U.S. and foreign officials, the
diplomatic greenhorn acquitted himself well on the international
stage, even displaying a certain verve for his mission.
   In Venezuela, where his job was mostly to spread goodwill,
Quayle's affable, political style was a hit with Latin leaders who
place great store in ``personalismo,'' one member of the U.S.
delegation said.
   ``I was skeptical but I'm impressed,'' said Michael Skol, a State
Department Latin America specialist who traveled with Quayle. After
one day of meetings, Skol said, ``He's making the right political
moves, the right body language. ... He's not saying too much when he
shouldn't say too much.''
   In El Salvador, a harder line was called for as Quayle went
before some 20 military officers who lead the nation's 56,000-member
armed forces. He delivered what was described by U.S. officials as
an emphatic admonition on the need for progress in curbing human
rights abuses.
   Quayle took that same message to the country's political and
business leaders, leaving a clear message that future U.S. aid will
be linked to the country's success on human rights.
   In Caracas, Quayle was a less dominant figure in the company of
some 20 heads of state and countless seasoned diplomats at the
inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez.
   Aside from Perez, the center stage figure was the
larger-than-life Fidel Castro of Cuba. He was ubiquitous on
television screens and he sat not far from Quayle at the
inauguration. The two did not speak to each other.
   Quayle's hectic schedule during two days in Caracas included
bilateral meetings with 10 heads of state, and less formal meetings
with about the same number.
   While the former senator's diplomatic inexperience did not go
unnoticed, that was not necessarily a negative factor in these
get-acquainted sessions, according to those familiar with them.
   ``The vice president left behind some extremely positive
feelings. He was well informed but at the same time he elicited the
opinions of the leaders he met with in a very sincere way,'' said
Otto Reich, the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela.
   `He's getting experience here,'' said Francisco Aguilar Urbina, a
Harvard-educated adviser to Costa Rica President Oscar Arias.
   He said the Latins had been unsure what to expect, having heard
mostly negative news reports about Quayle.
   Urbina said Quayle, while not a particularly imposing figure, was
projecting a positive image.
   ``They liked the fact that he went out of his way, broke with
protocol and just did things with regular people,'' said a member of
the U.S. delegation.
   Quayle on two occasions mingled with ordinary Brazilians, once
stopping his motorcade on the way from the airport to buy fruit at a
local market.
   He also visited a popular plaza where he worked a crowd campaign
style.
   A few hundred people quickly gathered and Quayle stepped up to a
statue of regional hero Simon Bolivar and pleased the crowd by
declaring Bolivar a hero of democracy in the United States as well.
   In his energetic, upbeat style, Quayle made friendly small talk
to get his bilateral meetings with heads of state underway.
   As photographers recorded the start of their meeting, he talked
with Costa Rica's Arias about mutual acquaintances in the U.S.
Senate. With Peru's President Alan Garcia he joked about his
upcoming 42nd birthday.
   Quayle was seen as ``sensible'' by President Jose Sarney of
Brazil, said Sarney's spokesman, Carlos Henrique de Almeida. He
indicated the Brazilians also see Quayle as a new guy on the job who
has a lot to learn.
   ``They were testing each other. Sarney was very clear and open,''
without the customary diplomatic verbiage, and Quayle was the same
way, de Almeida said.
   Guatemala's President Vinicio Cerezo subtly noted Quayle's
newcomer status, saying this was ``a really good opportunity for you
to come here and meet many leaders from Latin countries ... for you
especially.''

<HEAD>Former City Manager Pleads No Contest to Theft Charge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of falsifying his resume to
gain government and police jobs in several states pleaded no contest
to a theft charge and agreed to find another line of work.
   Carl Keyser Jr., 34, was fired from the city administrator's job
in the tiny southeastern Alaska village of Kake in December, one day
after he was arrested on a Kentucky fugitive warrant.
   He was charged in Kake with felony first-degree theft for using a
bogus resume to get hired and obtain $28,000 worth of salary,
benefits and expenses. He entered his no-contest plea Friday, but it
was not immediately approved by a judge. During a hearing held via
telephone, Superior Court Judge Thomas Schultz in Ketchikan took the
agreement under advisement and said he would wait for a probation
report on Keyser before deciding whether to accept it.
   Keyser, who had been in jail in nearby Petersburg since his
arrest, remains wanted in Pikeville, Ky., on another theft charge
stemming from his six-day stint as Pikeville's city manager last
August.
   In a plea agreement to settle the Kake charge, Keyser agreed to a
jail term of up to 90 days with credit for time already served,
which is about half of that. The agreement requires Keyser to pay
restitution for the money he received during the 2{ months he was on
the job, and would place Keyser on probation for seven years.
   The maximum penalties for first-degree theft are 10 years in
prison and a $100,000 fine.
   Keyser also agreed not to accept any type of government
employment, to sign a letter of apology to the town, and to remain
in Petersburg while awaiting sentencing.
   Schultz reduced bail on both theft charges to $2,500 each and
Keyser posted bail after Friday's hearing.
   Residents in Kake, a timber and fishing town about 75 miles south
of Juneau on Kupreanof Island, became suspicious of Keyser shortly
after he took the $44,000-a-year job. They accused him of
overspending and criticized him for refusing to release his resume
for public inspection.
   A police records check in December revealed the outstanding
Kentucky warrant.
   Interviews with prosecutors and city officials in several states
revealed that at least 19 of Keyser's jobs since 1980 have been with
city or county governments. Documents and the interviews also showed
Keyser used false information while obtaining at least 11 jobs.
   Kake officials have said they hired him because of an impressive
resume and people who gave glowing references. But they now believe
the resume and the references who were contacted by telephone were
fraudulent.
   Assistant District Attorney Steven West in Ketchikan said Friday
that Pikeville officials probably would dismiss their charge against
Keyser.
   Last month, Pikeville city commissioners asked the prosecutor
there to drop the charge, but the prosecutor said at the time that
he wanted to continue to press the case.
   In Pikeville, Keyser is accused of theft by deception for failure
to reimburse the city for $697 in travel expenses.
   Keyser declined to comment on the Kake case after the hearing. He
said he planned to do community and church volunteer work while
awaiting sentencing.
   In an interview in December, he maintained his innocence and said
the charges were the result of a conspiracy in Pikeville. Keyser
accused the news media and officials of seeking to make an example
of him.

Pollution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen
is asking the Treasury Department to investigate the possibility of
swapping Latin American debts for money that would be used to clean
up pollution in the Western Hemisphere.
   Bentsen, D-Texas, said Saturday he is particularly interested in
``debt-for-nature'' swaps that would involve Mexican debt and
cleaning up pollution along the U.S.-Mexico border, including the
dumping of raw sewage into Rio Grande.
   On Friday, Bentsen asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady for an
accounting of the Mexican debt situation before Congress assesses
his plan.
   Latin American debtors have become increasingly interested in
reducing their foreign debt in unconventional ways, Bentsen said,
citing ``debt-for-nature swaps'' in Costa Rica, Equador and Bolivia,
in which small quantities of their foreign debt have been converted
to local currencies for investment in environmental projects.
   In one case, an international consortium of environmental groups
purchased $5.6 million of Costa Rican debt from a bank in the United
States for about $700,000 and converted it to a local currency bond
worth $5.6 million, Bentsen said. Interest on that bond will be
devoted exclusively to environmental investments to protect clean
air and water and promote conservation in Costa Rica.
   ``Both Mexico and the United States would benefit if
environmental investments are stepped up along the border in
Mexico,'' Bentsen told Brady, citing the sharp deterioration of the
water in the Rio Grande and air pollution on the border.
   Bentsen said much of the $400 billion in Latin American debt will
never be paid back, but if it could be bought at a ``deep discount''
and then traded at full value in local currency to solve such
problems as sewage dumping and the chopping down of tropical rain
forests, ``we'd be far ahead.''
   The dumping of raw sewage into the Rio Grande is creating serious
health threats to citizens on both sides of the border, Bentsen
said, noting that 20 million gallons of raw sewage are dumped into
the river every day at Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.
   The enormous debt in Latin American nations has slowed their
growth and ``crimped foreign exchange reserves, hurting United
States exporters,'' Bentsen said.
   ``The sale of our manufactured exports to the 20 Latin American
republics ... fell 10 percent between 1980 and 1987,'' he wrote.
``Many world-class United States industrial firms like Caterpiller
suffered declines of 50 percent or more in traditional Latin
American markets.''

<HEAD>Sullivan Says Unpaid Leave Will Avoid Appearance of Conflict</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cabinet nominee Louis Sullivan said Saturday he
would take an unpaid leave of absence from his medical school while
serving as health and human services secretary to avoid any
appearance of a conflict of interest.
   Sullivan, president of the Morehouse School of Medicine in
Atlanta, had wanted to maintain his ties to the school with a paid
leave, but he withdrew the request after the White House raised
questions about the arrangement.
   ``I intend to preclude even the remotest possibility of any
appearance that my actions as secretary might be influenced due to
any outside income,'' Sullivan said in a statement released by the
White House.
   Sullivan said he has asked the medical school's executive
committee to grant him an unpaid leave of absence while he serves in
the Bush administration.
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said an unpaid leave would
mean the school ``would suspend any salary payments while he served
as secretary of HHS.''
   Sullivan earns about $170,000 a year from Morehouse, it was
learned.
   The arrangement is designed to avoid any conflict of interest
that could arise because Morehouse gets federal funds for its
programs. In fiscal 1988, the school received $5.8 million from HHS.
   Federal ethics officials indicated last week that Sullivan would
be able to receive payments from the school while serving at HHS.
Don Campbell, deputy director of the Office of Government Ethics,
said ethics officials had met with Sullivan and his lawyers and
``all the problems have been worked out.''
   A government source familiar with Sullivan's situation said the
nominee had a specific written contract entitling him to certain
payments for a leave of absence, based on days of service.
   Morehouse, like many academic institutions, gives its faculty
paid sabbatical leaves based on years of service. Sullivan was
allowed a paid sabbatical after 13 years of uninterupted service,
the White House said.
   The New York Times, in Saturday's editions, quoted a friend of
Sullivan's as saying the nominee had accrued about $300,000 worth of
sabbatical leave.
   But Sullivan said in his statement, ``President Bush has called
on all of those in his Cabinet ... to set the very highest ethical
standards, and to avoid even the appearance of potential conflicts
of interest. I agree emphatically with the president.''
   Sullivan's decision resolves one of the issues that has held up
his confirmation hearings in the Senate.
   The Senate Finance Committee last week postponed Sullivan's
confirmation hearings indefinitely at the request of the White House.
   The panel is awaiting completion of an FBI background check that
is focusing in part on Sullivan's ties to Reginald Eaves, a
suspended Fulton County, Ga., commissioner who has been convicted of
extortion.
   In a matter unrelated to the extortion case, Eaves was paid more
than $34,000 over four years as a lecturer at Morehouse while using
his seat on the commission to promote matters beneficial to the
school. He reportedly gave two lectures at Morehouse over the four
years.
   The Eaves controversy, however, does not appear to threaten
Sullivan's confirmation, according to lawmakers.

   A measles epidemic in the Portuguese
capital has killed five children, and 200 have been hospitalized,
the country's news agency said Saturday.
   Lusa quoted an official of the independent doctors' trade union
as saying the death toll could be higher.
   Dr. Jose Manuel Trindade said the measles outbreak was caused by
the Health Ministry's failure to provide a vaccination program, Lusa
reported.
   He said the union will transfer more doctors to children's
hospitals to help fight the epidemic. If doctors go ahead with a
three-day strike scheduled to start Wednesday, infected children
should be transferred to military hospitals, Trindade said.
   Doctors' unions and the government are at odds over a plan to
restructure health services.

   Experts on Saturday safely disposed of a
2,000-pound German bomb that had been buried since the World War II
blitz in the city's East End.
   Several hundred people were evacuated from their homes Friday
night after construction workers unearthed the huge bomb at a
building site.
   Army bomb disposal officers were called to the scene and worked
through the night, police at Scotland Yard headquarters said.
   Because the bomb was considered too dangerous to try to transport
out of the area, the army experts steamed explosives out of the
shell and conducted a controlled explosion of the detonator, police
and the Defense Ministry said.
   At least 20 roads in the area were closed to traffic.
   The bomb was found 15 feet below ground in Whitechapel, an area
of London most famous for the five unsolved Jack the Ripper murders
of 1888.
   Bombs that were dropped during the war and failed to go off are
periodically unearthed in London. The Germans bombed the East End
especially heavily in a bid to cripple the docks there.
   The latest find was one of the largest bombs unearthed in recent
years.

   Nearly a quarter of the North American
population of trumpeter swans is in danger of starvation at their
winter feeding grounds in eastern Idaho, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service officials say.
   Service biologist Signe Sather-Blair blames the 1988 drought and
current arctic cold for preventing the birds from getting their
normal food. They are not on the endangered species list, but they
are on Idaho's Sensitive Species list.
   The swans feed on aquatic plants, and low water in Henry's Fork
of the Snake River near Island Park has been frozen over. The
roughly 500 birds are unable to break through the ice to reach their
food.
   Elsewhere in Idaho, the cold and accompanying high wind has
interfered with state efforts to transplant bighorn sheep by
helicopter.
   In an attempt to rescue the swans, Fish and Wildlife was granted
1,600 acre-feet of water from irrigators in the Snake River Water
District and also received $8,000 from the Nature Conservancy to
purchase an additional 3,200 acre-feet of water.
   However, wildlife biologist Ruth Gail, who has studied the swans
for the Idaho Fish and Game Department, said Friday that the
increased water flow had not broken up the ice on the river.
   ``There is no way to measure what condition they are in now,''
Ms. Gail said of the swans. ``But it's pretty grim. They've had
decreased food supplies for 2{ months already this winter.''
   Ms. Gail said other swans, as many as 800, that water on lakes
and rivers around Yellowstone National Park may be in worse shape
than the flock at Henry's Fork.
   ``In all likelihood, we could lose a fair number of those
birds,'' she said. ``That's why it is so important to protect the
swans on the Henry's Fork.''
   The cold and high wind grounded the Idaho Department of Fish and
Game's plans to transplant bighorn sheep from the Morgan Creek
drainage north of Challis in central Idaho to the Selway River
drainage.
   Officials first attempted to capture sheep on Tuesday, ``but we
were blown out of the sky,'' Lloyd Oldenburg, the department's big
game supervisor, said Friday. He said it would be rescheduled for
the week of Feb. 12.
   He said two sheep were caught the first day but had to be
released once high winds kicked up and made flying difficult. Wind
and poor visibility also kept helicopters on the ground Wednesday.
   On Thursday, temperatures near zero, 10 mph wind and the
additional wind chill created by flying combined to create
temperatures estimated by Oldenburg at 100 degrees below zero.
   In addition, he said the net gun used to trap sheep froze and
would not fire, and the helicopter had no doors to protect the crew
from the cold.
   The lone ewe caught Thursday was released, but not before nasal,
blood and fecal samples were taken and a radio collar was placed on
her.
   Oldennburg said one of the sheep caught Tuesday, a 4-year-old
ram, appeared weak and in poor health, but he attributed that to two
years of drought and winter hardships rather than pneumonia. The
others appeared healthy, he said.

<HEAD>Protesting Nuns Begin Fifth Month In Seclusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Carmelite nuns protesting
what they call the liberalization of their order began the fifth
month barricaded in their monastery's infirmary Saturday with no
apparent sign of coming out.
   Betty Sutton, a friend who acts as their spokeswoman, says the
five women are resigned to wait until the Vatican rules on their
dispute with monastery officials.
   ``They're patient and they're awaiting an answer and they're very
hopeful,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Tim Manning, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Paterson, said the nuns have given no sign of ending their protest.
   They are objecting to the introduction of such things as
television and candy into the monestery and want it returned to the
Carmelites' traditionally austere lifestyle. They also seek
permission to remain at the monestery.
   No word has come from the Vatican, and there is no way of knowing
when a decision can be expected, Manning said.
   ``Obviously, it must have been a very trying time for all the
nuns, those inside the infirmary and in the monastery,'' he said.
   There are eight other nuns at the Monastery of the Most Blessed
Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel.
   The nuns locked themselves in the infirmary Oct. 4, saying they
were afraid officials wanted to expel them from the monastery for
their dissident views.
   Since the protest began, vows of one of the five nuns, Sister
Bernadette, have expired, and those of another, Sister John of the
Cross, expire Feb. 19, Manning said. Those two were under temporary,
five-year vows while the other three's vows have become permanent.
   The nuns refuse to recognize the expiration dates, saying
everything remains status quo while their case is before the Vatican.
   Manning said the monastery will take no action against the two
nuns whose vows have expired or are expiring.
   ``The hope is that it will soon be resolved,'' he said.

<HEAD>After 13 Years, Mafia Commission Releases Files</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most exhaustive Mafia study ever done by the
Italian government was released Saturday, 13 years after it was
completed, news reports said.
   The 3,852-page study lists the names of 2,405 people and 345
organizations or businesses collected by a special parliamentary
commission set up in 1962 to probe the Mafia, according to the ANSA
news agency and state-run television.
   The names range from well-known Italian politicians to such
fabled Mafiosi as Lucky Luciano, the Italian-American gangster, the
ANSA report said.
   ``The files published today don't refer to people suspected of
belonging to the Mafia or having links with it, but instead to every
person ... insinuated ... in a situation of this (Mafia) type,''
said the introduction written by Sen. Gerardo Chiaromonte, according
to ANSA.
   Chiaromonte is head of the current parliamentary anti-Mafia
commission.
   Sources for the names included police, newspaper reports,
witnesses who testified before the commission and anonymous tips.
   The report's release had been expected since Chiaromonte's
commission voted in November and again in December to make it public.
   No one answered the telephone in Chiaromonte's office Saturday,
and the Senate press office was closed.
   It was not clear whether the report would have much effect, both
because of its age and the varying credibility of the sources.
   Chiaromonte said the commission decided to make the list public
in order to dispel any suspicion that ``a public organism wants to
hide, in all or in part, news regarding the involvement of
politicians in Mafia affairs.''
   Links between politicians and the Mafia have been a hot topic
since the so-called ``maxi-trial'' ended in December 1987 with 338
people found guilty.
   The 30-member parliamentary commission issued statements listing
the names of some suspected Mafia leaders. But the final report did
not give names. The part made public called for trying suspected
organized crime figures on tax charges and increasing surveillance
of them.
   Leftist members of the commission, in a minority, had charged
that ``powder keg'' revelations were being covered up. But other
members of the commission said unsubstantiated charges should not be
published.
   The report released Saturday focuses on Mafia activity from 1963
to the early 1970s.
   It reportedly includes names of local and national politicians
ranging from communists to members of the far-right Italian
Socialist Movement.
   Among those denounced to the commission were several politicians,
judges and writers who had taken strong stands against the Mafia,
suggesting that some people tried to use the investigation to damage
their enemies.
   One senator who accused several politicians of having Mafia ties
was himself later charged by an anonymous source with having links
to the Mafia.

   An overnight anti-gang sweep by a police task
force resulted in the arrests of 117 people and the seizure of more
than 411 grams of cocaine, authorities said Saturday.
   The 14-hour sweep, which involved 242 officers and ended at 3
a.m. Saturday, was the latest in a series of sweeps that began last
year.
   Seventy-one of those arrested were alleged gang members, said
Teri Dixon of the police department's Training Division. There were
50 felony arrests, and police seized six guns and 411.5 grams of
cocaine, Ms. Dixon said.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leaders met Saturday to prepare
for historic talks with the government that Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski called ``a significant event in the life of
Poland.''
   Lech Walesa and other leaders of the outlawed labor movement are
to sit down with government leaders on Monday to begin discussing
social and economic reforms considered crucial to this increasingly
impoverished nation.
   The long-awaited negotiations, known as the round-table talks,
will take place in Warsaw and also address the legalization of
Solidarity, the first recognized independent union in the East bloc.
   ``There was commotion concerning the round table in which I had
to take part as chief of government because I was aware of the fact
that the round table is a significant event in the life of Poland,''
Rakowski said in nationally televised address Saturday night.
   ``There may be advantages to all of us.''
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the opening session would
be aired on Polish television, the state-run news agency PAP
reported.
   In Gdansk, meanwhile, Solidarity's Citizen's Committee, which was
formed by Walesa in December to address social and political
problems, met to prepare for the talks.
   The names of the Solidarity delegates to the talks will be voted
on Sunday, said Solidarity spokesman Piotr Konopka.
   The government proposed the talks during a wave of strikes in
August, Poland's worst labor unrest since authorities imposed
martial law in December 1981.
   Walesa refused to agree to talks until the authorities agreed to
legalize the unionm which was banned by parliament in 1982.
   On Jan. 18, in a dramatic reversal of policy, the communist party
Central Committee said it would be willing to legalize the union if
its members agreed to obey the law, refrain from strikes and help
reform the economy.
   Walesa has said he agreed to bargain with authorities because of
the magnitude of Poland's problems.
   The offer has caused deep concern among the rank-and-file
communist party leadership, which concluded a three-day ideology
conference on Saturday.
   ``The conference confirmed that Marxism in Poland is at a stage
of difficult, but bold and unrestrained search,'' Politburo member
Marian Orzechowski said, PAP reported.
   Andrzej Czyz, head of the party's ideological department, said
the party would advocate political reform and the introduction of
greater freedom.
   ``The primary postulate was to speed the relinquishing of a
centrally governed society,'' Czyz said at a news conference.

<TEXT>
   Egypt and Israel will resume talks on the
disputed Taba border area Sunday and have agreed to try to resolve
all pending issues by early next month to expedite an Israeli
withdrawal, the Foreign Ministry said.
   ``The United States has told both sides that in its estimate, if
the two parties negotiate carefully and with good intentions, it
will be possible to end the negotiations in four weeks,'' said a
document signed Saturday by Nabil el-Araby, head of Egypt's Taba
delegation; Israeli ambassador Shamoun Shamir; and Frank Wisner, the
U.S. ambassador to Egypt.
   Washington is a partner in negotiations over the 250-acre patch
of beach overlooking the Gulf of Aqaba. It was awarded to Egypt by
international arbitrators Sept. 20.
   Egypt and Israel have twice set and broken deadlines to work out
Israel's withdrawal from Taba, leading to a stalemate the United
States has been trying to break.
   Three main issues block agreement: Egyptian compensation for an
Israeli-built luxury hotel and beach cabana complex; access for
Israelis to Taba; and location of the border line in the area where
tourist facilities are.
   A Foreign Ministry official said the talks would resume Sunday
between technical experts in Egypt and Israel. Teams in Cairo will
discuss compensation for the hotel and beach cabanas and those in
Hertzilia, Israel will negotiate Israelis' access to Taba.
   The ministry official said the Israeli withdrawal from Taba
should take only ``a few days'' once the pending issues are worked
out. The spokesman was not identified by name in accordance with
ministry instructions.

   A former county assistant prosecutor will plead
guilty to federal charges he manufactured evidence in an effort to
implicate top aides to Gov. Michael Dukakis in a drug case,
prosecution and defense attorneys said.
   Kevin J. Ross, 33, of Waltham plans to plead guilty Monday in
U.S. District Court to two charges: creating false documents and
making false statements, Kevin Sharkey, the federal prosecutor in
the case, told The Boston Globe in a report published Saturday.
   On each count, Ross faces up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   Ross' attorney, Anthony R. Pelusi Jr., confirmed to the newspaper
that Ross would plead guilty. Pelusi did not return a telephone
message left Saturday by The Associated Press.
   According to court documents, Ross filled an address book with
the telephone numbers of key members of Dukakis' presidential
campaign and slipped it into a folder containing evidence seized
from the home of an alleged cocaine dealer.
   Among the names and numbers Ross allegedly wrote in the black
book were those of Dukakis presidential campaign chairman Paul
Brountas and fund-raiser Robert Farmer. But investigators say they
have found no evidence that Ross, a registered Republican, was part
of a politically motivated conspiracy.
   Ross was arrested in October and accused of planting the faked
address book.
   Ross later admitted entering into the book 35 of 71 names and
telephone numbers, including those of colleagues against whom he had
a grudge, Dukakis aides and reputed criminals Ross believed should
be brought to justice, the Globe reported.
   Investigators said that as part of the alleged scheme, Ross, a
former prosecutor in the Suffolk County district attorney's office,
called telephone numbers into the beeper the alleged dealer carried,
aiming to link those numbers, and the people with whom they were
listed, with the dealer.
   Ross was fired from his Suffolk County job after his arrest.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested a rebel leader at a hotel and
dealt a strong blow to Peru's pro-Cuban guerrilla movement,
authorities said Saturday.
   Police said Victor Polay, 37, was seized with a female companion
late Friday in Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima.
   Polay, a former college friend of President Alan Garcia, is
considered one of the leaders of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, which favors Cuba-styled Marxism. The group began armed
actions against the government in 1984.
   The seizure of Polay, known as Commander Rolando, is the most
important guerrilla arrest since Osman Morote, the reputed No. 2
leader of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla band, was captured in
June, said police.
   They spoke on condition of anonymity, citing security reasons.
   The Tupac Amaru group is smaller and considered much less violent
than the Shining Path, whose nine-year insurgency has claimed more
than 12,000 lives. The two groups do not have ties.
   Dozens of police surrounded the hotel where Polay was staying and
arrested him without a struggle. Police refused to say how they knew
he was at the hotel.
   The Lima newspaper Expreso said Polay shouted ``Death to
informers!'' as he was led away.
   The Tupac Amaru guerrillas startled Peru in November 1987 when
Polay led 100 well-armed rebels in a monthlong series of raids near
Tarapoto, a jungle city 435 miles northeast of Lima.
   The military quickly dispersed the rebel column. The government
never fully disclosed details of the clashes, but analysts said the
rebel band was seriously hurt. Its armed actions since have been
rare.
   In the 1960s, Polay was a student leader of the governing
center-left Aprista Party. He reportedly studied with Garcia in
Europe in the early 1970s.

   Iranian authorities have carried out summary
executions, arbitrary arrests, and torture on a troubling scale
despite the cease-fire in the war with Iraq, a new U.N. report says.
   The study for the U.N. Human Rights Commission said a wave of
executions in 1988, especially after an invasion by anti-government
forces based in Iraq, halted a two-year decrease in the number of
executions. It said the scale of recent abuse in Iran ``justifies
international concern.''
   The 42-page report, released Friday, lists 1,096 names of people
alleged to have been executed between late July and mid-December.
``But it was alleged that there were in all probability several
thousand victims,'' said the report.
   The U.N.-mediated cease-fire in the eight-year war took effect
Aug. 20.
   ``Arrests are apparently so numerous that some high officials
have requested the authorities to act with more moderation,'' said
the report. It said detention of relatives of people accused of
political crimes ``appears to be a common practice.''
   The study also pointed to continuing reports of ill-treatment and
torture of prisoners. ``Investigation, trial and serving of sentence
are reportedly effected under duress, hardships and different kinds
of torture,'' it said.
   The report, which was done from outside Iran, collected
information from witnesses and reports in Iranian and foreign media.

   House Democrats tried with
little success on Saturday to temporarily put aside the firestorm
over a proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise and focus instead
on broader national issues.
   While an inspirational speech by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and
the pampering and recreation of the Greenbrier resort helped soothe
frayed nerves, the lawmakers remained anxious for a way to put the
pay issue permanently behind them.
   Former President Reagan's proposal to raise federal pay for
members of Congress, federal judges and top executive branch
employees takes effect Wednesday unless both the House and Senate
vote to kill it. The Senate has already done so, making House
Democrats the center of the controversy because Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, plans to let it take effect.
   Wright said he would hold a subsequent vote to reduce the raise
to 30 percent, but rank-and-file Democrats continued to voice
skepticism that such a plan would quell public outcry.
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., a member of the Democratic leadership
supporting's Wright's approach, acknowledged that many House members
were willing to give up any pay raise even though they believed they
needed to earn more than the current salary of $89,500.
   ``I think they're frustrated with trying to answer to an angry
public and an insatiable press,'' said Hoyer. ``At some point,
people get tired of being looked upon as thieves and greedy folks. I
think everybody's getting a little testy _ like me.''
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., offered one of the most graphic
descriptions yet of the controversy. ``It's like living with a
political gas leak, only it's not odorless or colorless,'' he said.
``And the voters are going to strike the match.''
   Many of the approximately 150 Democrats spent Saturday morning
listening to panel discussions on issues facing the country,
including the deficit and social economic inequities. Then Cuomo,
delivering the keynote speech at a luncheon, told them that
Democrats should take heart because President Bush's statements that
more needed to be done for the homeless and needy was an embracing
of Democratic values and ``a giant step forward to the truth and
progress.''
   ``He has clearly said that the Democrats were right ... by
candidly rejecting his predecessor's narrow view of life in
America,'' Cuomo said. If Bush fails to push forward his ``kinder
and gentler'' programs, he will ``have earned himself some cheap
grace by reciting some Democratic poetry,'' he said.
   In such an event, he said, Democrats should push their agenda
even if that eventually means seeking to raise taxes to cover the
cost.
   ``When you present him with the solutions, would it not be
difficult for the president then to say no?'' he asked.
   Cuomo made no direct mention of the pay raise controversy, but
kidded the lawmakers that their annual retreat to West Virginia to
get away from daily pressures was ``a great idea ... when it works.''
   Several dozen news people were watching the conference but the
resort otherwise coddled and protected the Democrats.
   A small band of anti-pay-raise demonstrators was kept outside the
front gates, seen only by those lawmakers who cruised by in resort
limousines on their way to the skeet and trap-shooting range. The
hotel switchboard screened callers, asking whether they were calling
about the pay raise.
   Wright, at the center of the controversy, kept mostly to himself
except for introducing Cuomo at the luncheon. Protected by staff, he
didn't talk to reporters about the pay raise but praised Cuomo's
speech as a challenge to Bush, who addresses a joint meeting of
Congress Thursday night.
   ``We'll now see whether it's words or whether it's deeds,'' he
said. ``Words are fine. They set a good tone. But now it's time for
deeds.''
   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., who is Cuomo's congressman, praised
the speech as ``what we came to hear.''
   ``He's the only constituent I've seen in two weeks who didn't ask
about the pay raise,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Ben and Jerry, who made their mark selling
premium Vermont-made ice cream, are trying their hand at marketing
worldwide peace in hopes it will be as popular someday as their New
York Super Fudge Crunch.
   Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, co-founders of Ben &amp; Jerry's
Homemade Inc., are in the seventh month of their ``1 Percent For
Peace'' campaign, an effort to have 1 percent of the U.S. military
budget devoted to promoting peace.
   ``Certainly taking 1 percent of the military budget is not going
to leave us open to attack,'' Cohen said. ``It's just saying, let's
redirect a small portion of it, and I think people can understand
that.''
   One percent of the military budget amounts to $3 billion, Cohen
said.
   ``If you put $3 billion in the bank, the interest alone would be
$750,000 a day,'' he said.
   The ice-cream makers would like to see the money spent on things
like exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union,
conversion of weapons factories to power plants, or a multinational
youth corps for problems like homelessness and hunger.
   They are financing the lobbying effort with 1 percent of the
profits from the Peace Pop, a chocolate-covered ice cream bar on a
stick that sells for $1.75. One percent of the profits comes to
about $50,000 a year.
   They expect it will take five to 10 years for the idea to reach
the people who can make it work.
   ``I think of this as a product, the same as we've been in the
business of marketing ice cream. So the beginning's fairly slow,''
Cohen said. ``We're at the very beginning, and actually, I'm
incredibly excited at how fast it's going.''
   Ben &amp; Jerry's, which generates annual sales of $32 million, began
11 years ago in a renovated Burlington gas station. The 1 Percent
For Peace project began just as inauspiciously when Cohen discussed
the concept with a friend of a friend in Ithaca, N.Y.
   An office was set up in Ithaca, at the Ben &amp; Jerry's Foundation,
a company group that distributes about $250,000 a year to charitable
causes.
   The push for peace was officially launched in New York City in
August and again at the Newport, R.I., Folk Festival.
   While Robert Cray and Taj Mahal entertained the crowd, Cohen and
Greenfield manned a booth and collected signatures on petitions,
sold T-shirts with the 1 percent logo and promoted the concept to
passers-by.
   So far, the campaign has attracted interest from roughly 40
businesses. They include a restaurant in Ithaca, a children's
musical recording company in California and a construction company
in Woodstock, N.Y., said Neil Schwartzbach, executive director of
the 1 Percent organization.
   ``The idea here is to try to get as many businesses as possible
to use this logo,'' Cohen said.
   The organization's goal for 1989 is to interest another 320
companies in the concept. They, in turn, will spread the word an
estimated 161.5 million times, either through brochures, bumper
stickers, logos on their products or similar means.
   ``I don't believe that the world cannot change,'' Cohen said.
``And if the world is going to change we have to take positive steps
_ we as citizens _ to change it.''

   Right-wing radicals claim they are
winning the allegiance of more mainstream Germans after capturing 11
seats in the West Berlin legislature.
   ``The Berlin elections show that a psychological barrier has been
removed,'' said Michael Kuehnen, the leader of a Nazi-oriented group
and a prominent right-wing extremist.
   West Germany has been involved in some deep soul-searching ever
since Jan. 29, when the far-right Republican Party won 11 seats in
the 138-seat legislature and 7.5 percent of the vote.
   With their showing, the Republicans also won the right to send
two representatives to the federal Bundestag next year. West Berlin
is considered a state under the West German system, but its
representatives to the national parliament have limited powers.
   Though a sweeping rightist trend seems virtually impossible in
modern West Germany, a Jewish leader called the elections ``a
warning shot.''
   ``I fear the Republicans have hit upon a mood that's not just in
West Berlin,'' said Frankfurt Jewish Community spokesman Michel
Friedman.
   He said the strong showing by the Republican Party will make the
extreme right ``socially acceptable'' to many West Germans.
   The Republicans campaigned on a platform that included a call to
oust foreign workers from the city.
   Their positions won broader support than pollsters predicted,
reflecting the volatile and growing nationalist sentiments stirred
by housing and job shortages that are especially acute in West
Berlin.
   The big, established parties _ the conservative Christian
Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party _ won most of the
rest of the seats in the West Berlin legislature.
   The outcome of the West Berlin elections also mobilized
activists. An estimated 10,000 people marched through downtown West
Berlin on Saturday to protest the right-wing groups.
   ``Foreigners stay, Nazis away,'' shouted demonstrators, who
marched peacefully.
   Also Saturday, about 200 right-wing supporters of the Free German
Workers Party marched in the northern city of Rotenburg, drawing a
counter-demonstration by 1,200 opponents. Four hundred police
officers stood by, and one minor injury was reported from a thrown
rock.
   In Munich, Republican Party chief Franz Schoenhuber said his
members would not yield to the ``terror'' of demonstrators.
   ``On the contrary, it makes us as a law-and-order party stronger
and stronger,'' the 66-year-old former Nazi SS soldier told
reporters last week.
   Both the mainstream right and left have warned that more
Republican successes are possible.
   ``The danger is certainly there, since they're conducting their
campaign with Pied Piper techniques,'' said Gov. Lothar Spaeth of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, a Christian Democrat.
   Some West Germans point to other troubling signs:
   _The Republicans are expected to field candidates in some of the
municipal elections this year in five more states.
   _Right-wing extremists already are making elaborate plans to
celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hitler on April 20.
The number of extreme rightists is estimated at about 28,300 by the
federal Interior Ministry.
   _A flood of asylum-seekers, numbering 103,076 last year alone,
has been angering some people in towns and cities across West
Germany. Some West Germans say the foreigners contribute to high
unemployment and housing shortages.
   Since the Berlin elections, a campaign by an openly Nazi-oriented
group in the town of Langen outside Frankfurt has been receiving
attention nationwide.
   The campaign leader is Kuehnen, who was released from prison in
March 1988 after a 3{-year sentence for pro-Nazi activities.
   ``As individuals we are Nazis,'' said the 33-year-old Kuehnen
during an AP interview. He wore a brown shirt and was accompanied by
a bodyguard carrying what was described as a tear-gas pistol.
   Kuehnen repeatedly insisted his group is not a Nazi organization,
which are banned by West German law.
   ``We are proud of the past. We are proud to be Germans,'' Kuehnen
said. ``We want to break taboos. For example, we plan to present a
motion to rename the railroad station square `Adolf Hitler Square.'''

<HEAD>West Germany, Amid Libyan Scandal, Restates Support For Chemical
Weapons Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, facing allegations it
allowed exports that helped Libya and Iraq develop poison gas, said
Saturday it wants this week's Geneva Conference on Disarmament to
ban chemical weapons.
   The 40-nation conference begins Tuesday in Geneva.
   ``The federal government hopes that the Geneva negotiations lead
to a worldwide, comprehensive and unqualified ban on the development
and production, possession, acquisition, proliferation and use of
chemical weapons,'' said government spokesman Friedhelm Ost.
   The meeting's secretary-general, Milan Komatina, told reporters
in Geneva that Libya and Syria have asked to join in the conference
and that he does not expect objections from the participants.
   Washington says Libya has built a chemical weapons plant in the
desert city of Rabta with the help of West German firms.
   Komatina, a Yugoslav, spoke Friday at end of a two-week
closed-door session of the Disarmament Conference's special working
group that is preparing a treaty that would ban chemical weapons.
   He said there is a positive climate for the talks because of
France's decision to drop its proposal that each country be allowed
to hold limited ``security stocks'' during the 10-year treaty period
when chemical weapons should be destroyed.
   Ost said West Germany sought a chemical weapons ban since 1954
and nearly three years ago asked the United States to remove its
chemical weapons from the country no later than 1992.
   But Ost made no mention in his statement of an escalating
controversy over West German firms' shipments of equipment to Iraq
and Libya that were apparently used to produce chemical weapons.
   On Friday, the Degussa AG company of Frankfurt confirmed a report
that German customs officials halted a Libya-bound shipment of its
chemicals to determine if they could be used to produce explosives
or poison gas.
   The Nordsee Zeitung newspaper in the port city of Bremerhaven
reported Friday that customs officials refused to authorize loading
of 17 containers of the chemical hexamethylene tetramine for
shipment by the Degussa company to Libya. The crystalline compound
is used in the vulcanization of rubber, in medicine, explosives and
other products.
   The company also acknowledged it sent chemicals to Libya since
1983 for use in making fertilizer and not explosives or poison gas.
   Investigations are under way into the export activities of a
number of West German companies, primarily Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr,
but the probes have to date produced no charges or arrests in West
Germany.

<HEAD>Chrysler Donates Several Buildings To Kenosha, To Demolish Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has donated several abandoned
buildings to the community before tearing down most of its former
car assembly plant here, officials said.
   The company, whose auto assembly lines in Kenosha were closed in
December, announced Friday that some structures would remain for use
by the city, county and Gateway Technical College.
   John Collins, the Kenosha County executive administrator, said
Chrysler wanted to raze all the main plant buildings except for an
engine factory and stamping operation, but local officials persuaded
it to donate some buildings.
   Richard Dauch, Chrysler's vice president of manufacturing, said
the donations represent about 550,000 square feet of office and
factory space in four buildings. In addition, some land near a
municipal golf course will be deeded to the city of 80,000
residents, he said.
   The plant's main office building will be donated to Kenosha
County for its Social Services Department, officials said. Collins
said officials plan to move the Wisconsin Job Service into the
building to create a central location for former Chrysler workers
seeking welfare and job-hunting help.
   Dauch said a factory building will be turned over to Gateway Tech
for a business incubator center. A nearby building will be donated
for the school's administrative offices. Kenosha Area Development
Corp. will move into a fourth building.
   Chrysler obtained the factory complex as part of its 1987
purchase of American Motors Corp. The complex had been used for
automaking for 86 years.
   Chrysler announced in January 1988 that it would shut down most
of the plant, citing its age and inefficiency.
   Wisconsin officials threatened to sue Chrysler, saying the
automaker had promised verbally to keep the plant open through 1992
in exchange for $5 million in state job training funds.
   Chrysler reached an out-of-court settlement that included $250
million in aid to workers, the community of nearly 80,000 residents
and the state.
   About 4,500 jobs were lost last year when Chrysler closed the
factory except for engine production.
   The company's 1.8-million-square-feet engine plant, which employs
1,350 workers, will remain in operation, Dauch said. The company
also will retain ownership of several parking lots and a shipping
yard, he said.

<HEAD>Fourth Game In Timman-Portisch Match Adjourned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fourth game in the World Chess
Championship Candidates quarterfinal between Holland's Jan Timman
and Hungary's Lajos Portisch was adjourned after 62 moves Saturday.
   The bishops and pawns left on the board after six hours of play
might still hide some surprises but experts felt a draw would be the
most likely outcome.
   Dutch grandmaster John van der Wiel, who visited the tournament
hall in the basement of an Antwerp luxury hotel to see his
countryman in action, even said he expected the two opponents would
sign the draw without further play.
   ``Of course, Timman will analyze the position thoroughly with his
seconds overnight, but I for one don't see how he could possibly
avoid splitting the point with Portisch in this one,'' Van der Wiel
said.
   A draw would be a serious setback for the 37-year-old Timman, who
played white in Saturday's game and desperately needed a victory to
catch up with his 51-year-old Hungarian opponent.
   Portisch won the third encounter the day before and was leading
2-1 with only two more games to go in the six-game match, one of a
series of knock-out contests to select a challenger who will play
world champion Gary Kasparov for his title in 1990.
   Timman started the game well, following a line from the Ruy Lopez
to build up a better position and concentrating his forces on the
queenside, where he seemed set to launch a strong offensive.
   At the decisive moment, however, he hesitated, playing a number
of careful moves, when he might have pressed his advantage and start
an all-out offensive.
   Portisch reacted immediately, exchanging queens and, after some
tactical complications, getting the rooks off the board as well.
   Even Timman's West German second, Vlastimil Hort, admitted the
Hungarian was ``playing a fine defending game'' at that stage.
   ``Portisch kept a cool head'', he said. ``Jan's attack seemed
decisive, but maybe Portisch had calculated farther and decided he
could take the risk.''
   ``Jan was probably right in not going all out. In fact, I think
it's a miracle the way he is playing, especially after the defeat he
suffered yesterday. Most players would not even try. They would
settle for a draw the day after they lost a game,'' Hort said.
   Public attention for the duel was overwhelming at first, with
about one hundred spectators watching in the silence of the
tournament hall, while another two hundred thronged the auditorium
next door, where two Belgian masters, Richard Meulders and Luc
Winants, were commenting on the game _ Meulders in Flemish and
Winants in French.
   But after Portisch had succeeded in maintaining the balance and
the game developed into an ever more drawish position, most people
went home until only a handful were left to see Portisch seal his
move at the 62nd.
   The resumption is to be played on Sunday with the fifth game
following on Monday.

<TEXT>
   British and French diplomats left Kabul
on Saturday after their nations closed their embassies, joining an
exodus of Western countries as the last Soviet soldiers pull out of
Afghanistan.
   Britain's 19 embassy staff members and the four French Embassy
workers flew aboard a chartered plane to New Delhi and arrived there
Saturday evening. Their departure from Kabul was delayed a day
because of a storm.
   A convoy of about 40 Soviet military vehicles rolled out of the
snowy capital about 3 a.m., headed toward the border.
   On Friday, a huge column of tanks, armored personnel carriers and
trucks slipped out under cover of darkness and headed up the Salang
Highway, the only route between Kabul and the Soviet border.
   The deputy foreign minister of the Soviet Union, Yuli Vorontsov,
was quoted as saying the Red Army will be out of the country well
ahead of the Feb. 15 deadline set by a U.N.-mediated accord.
   ``Within four days, there will be no Soviet forces in
Afghanistan,'' Vorontsov was quoted as saying by Iran's official
Tehran Radio during a visit to Iran.
   The radio said Vorontsov would discuss with Iranian officials and
Afghan resistance leaders the future of Afghanistan after the
Soviets leave.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Pakistan
on the same mission early Sunday and was expected to propose a
political settlement.
   ``The Soviet leadership has decided to consult with the
government of Pakistan on how best to contribute to restoring peace
and tranquility in Afghanistan,'' Shevardnadze told reporters before
a scheduled day of talks with Pakistani officials who support the
guerrillas.
   But he added, ``Problems have been piling up. There are quite a
few of them.''
   Pakistani Defense Minister Ghulam Sarwar Cheema said Saturday in
the Saudi capital of Riyadh that his government has formed a
committee to oversee resettlement of the 3 million Afghan refugees
living in Pakistan.
   ``The process of shifting Afghan refugees from Pakistan to their
homeland will be handled smoothly after complete evacuation of the
Soviet forces from Afghanistan,'' said Cheema, on a state visit to
Saudi Arabia.
   Guerrilla leaders, meanwhile, warned they might launch a major
attack on the strategic city of Jalalabad, about 90 miles east of
Kabul.
   Abdul Zaher, a senior commander of the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla
group, said the insurgents did not want to attack the crowded city
for fear of injuring civilians but that they might if communist
forces there don't give up soon.
   Jalalabad could be the first major Afghan city to fall to the
guerrillas, local insurgent commanders said. They said its fall
would weaken the defense of Kabul and open up the highway to the
capital.
   In and around Kabul, Afghan solders patrol the streets and
outdoor markets. The armored personnel carriers once stationed in
the crowded bazaars are gone.
   Western countries began pulling their diplomats from Kabul late
last month because of fears for their safety once the Soviets are
gone and Afghan troops are left to battle Moslem guerrillas alone.
   The Soviets intervened in December 1979 to back Afghan troops in
their war with the Moslem guerrillas. They began pulling their
estimated 100,000 soldiers out in May, in accordance with the U.N.
accord.
   Soviet and Afghan officials have estimated there are about 1,000
Soviet soldiers still in Afghanistan, including a small contingent
assigned to Kabul airport.
   Giant Ilyushin-76 transport planes have been flying into Kabul
ferrying supplies of flour and other goods in short supply.
   Britain quietly shut its embassy early Saturday. ``We didn't want
a public display,'' said one diplomat, referring to the highly
publicized flag-lowering ceremony when the U.S. Embassy closed.
   Britain's highest-ranking diplomat in Kabul, Ian Mackley, said he
looked forward to returning home. Mackley was married Jan. 21 in
Britain and returned to Kabul on Jan. 22.
   ``I postponed my honeymoon to come here. I hope to resume it
fairly soon,'' he said.
   The French charge d'affaires, Raymond Petit, saw his staff off at
the airport. He said he plans to leave Kabul on Monday and was
staying over to ``lock the doors.''
   West Germany, Italy and Japan also have closed their embassies,
and some eastern European and Asian countries are reducing their
staff.
   President Najib denounced the moves Thursday as ``psychological
warfare ... trying to create panic and embarrass and confuse public
opinion.''
   He said diplomats would be safe in Kabul after Feb. 15.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Regulator Cannot Offer Immunity, Thornburgh Says</HEAD>

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Saturday he
has told regulators with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ``in no
uncertain terms'' that they lack authority to promise immunity from
prosecution to savings and loan officials.
   ``Henceforth it's not to be indulged in,'' Thornburgh said. The
attorney general said he believed there were only ``isolated
instances'' in which bank board regulators offered immunity from
prosecution to those under investigation for fraud in the savings
and loan industry.
   Thornburgh, in an impromptu news conference following a luncheon
speech at the American Bar Association convention here, declined to
be drawn into a possible controversy over gun control.
   ABA President Robert Raven said Friday he asked Thornburgh to
support a federal waiting period for would-be gun buyers.
   Raven, citing the recent slaying of five children at a Stockton,
Calif., school and the wounding of four others in Washington, D.C.,
said there is a ``glaring loophole'' in federal law that allows
people to buy automatic weapons and assault rifles.
   Thornburgh refused to say if he supports Raven's waiting period
proposal or if such weapons are too easily purchased.
   ``We want to look at it,'' the attorney general said.
   The savings and loan questions were prompted by a reports that
federal prosecutors are being hamstrung by promises of immunity made
by Home Loan Bank Board regulators.
   A U.S. attorney in Los Angeles said top officials of the failed
San Marino Savings &amp; Loan Corp. were told they could avoid
prosecution by helping regulators recover some of the money lost
when the thrift institution collapsed in 1984.
   Thornburgh said the offer was a misunderstanding made without
consultation with the Justice Department and that bank board
regulators have been warned not to do it again.
   Thornburgh also met with the ABA group that assesses judicial
appointees and said he thinks it will continue to play a role in
evaluating Bush administration nominees to the federal bench.
   In his remarks to the ABA luncheon, Thornburgh said the Bush
administration will be a tough fighter against street crime.
   ``Firm and effective action against drug-related criminal
activities, including application of the newly enacted federal death
penalty, will be necessary to end the free-fire zones that have
taken the lives of so many innocent people,'' he said.
   Thornburgh also said he supports a pay raise of about 50 percent
for federal judges that is due to take effect unless both houses of
Congress vote to block it before Wednesday.
   ``It's absolutely essential that the pay-raise bill take
effect,'' he said.
   Thornburgh also said he will press for higher pay for U.S.
attorneys and FBI agents.

   Amnesty International, which has been trying for
decades to get into the Soviet Union to investigate human rights
abuses, has been invited for a visit, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Officials of the London-based human rights organization were not
available to confirm the report in the Guardian. The paper said the
group had written to Moscow to discuss the timing of the visit and
the range of people and institutions with whom contacts would be
sought.
   Amnesty International has been seeking an invitation to the
Soviet Union since 1960, when the organization was established, the
Guardian said.
   In December, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared his
government no longer held political prisoners, and Western observers
generally acknowledge a dramatic drop in the number of political
prisoners since Gorbachev rose to power.
   Amnesty International said in October that it had information on
150 Soviets ``imprisoned solely for the non-violent exercise of
their fundamental human rights.''
   The human rights group said its list included about 30 religious
believers, 30 conscientious objectors to military service and about
20 people held against their will for indefinite periods in
psychiatric hospitals.
   It also said it had information that since February 1987, 314
political prisoners had been released in the Soviet Union, ``249 of
whom we knew or suspected to have been prisoners of conscience.''

   The first feverish day of Carnival
exploded Saturday with thousands of revelers jamming costume balls,
bars and samba parades to indulge in four days of drinking, dancing
and sexual abandon.
   All over South America's largest country _ from humid Amazon
cities to the concrete urban center of Sao Paulo _ merrymakers
traded their everyday clothes for sequin and feather-clad costumes
and shook and shimmied to samba strains in private clubs or in the
streets.
   By midnight Friday, nightclubs and hotel ballrooms were jammed
throughout Rio, the hub of Carnival, as liquor flowed and
sweat-slicked, scantily clad bodies gyrated and swung to the
rhythmic sounds of pulsing samba bands in the warm summer night.
   Streets and private clubs decorated with streamers and flashing
bulbs awaited the crush of thousands of Brazilians and tourists.
   Banks, stores and government offices shut down for the four-day
frenzy and were to reopen on Ash Wednesday, when Carnival officially
ends.
   In Recife, about 1,536 miles northeast of Rio, lavishly decorated
trucks pumping highly amplified samba music from their loudspeakers
inched down dancer-packed avenues.
   Meanwhile, in the coastal cities of Fortaleza and Salvador,
sunbathers packed beaches and revelers went wild dancing ``the
crocodile,'' hopping back and forth along boulevards behind
throbbing samba bands and music trucks that headed parade
processions.
   But spirits were hardly high in Belo Horizonte, the nation's
third-largest city about 288 miles northwest of Rio. After the
municipal government canceled the city's main Carnival festivities
because of a lack of funds, thousands packed bus stations and
airports to enjoy the festival in other cities.
   In Rio, however, little seemed able to dampen Carnival euphoria _
not last year's record 1,000 percent inflation, nor charges of
corruption and nepotism in the government, nor the closing of
schools and hospitals because city employees hadn't received their
December paychecks.
   Not even heavy showers Friday and Saturday seemed to deaden the
city's festive spirit.
   After the official opening ceremonies Saturday, in which jolly
and fat King Momo, Carnival's symbolic sovereign, received the keys
to the city from Mayor Marcello Alencar, crowds of thousands
accompanied by bands and parades started singing and dancing down
the streets of downtown Rio.
   Poorer Brazilians banged out rhythms on pots and pans and
frolicked in the falling rain, while the city's well-heeled donned
glittering beaded costumes and danced the samba all night in
luxurious ballrooms.
   On Friday night at the Sugar Loaf Ball, the first of a number of
ornate, celebrity-studded balls at the base of Rio's famed Sugar
Loaf Mountain, the crowd went wild dancing beneath statues of
Marilyn Monroe and Lenin.
   And at Rio's famed Scala nightclub, the site of some of the
rowdiest Carnival balls, party-goers ate and drank from a stock of 1
ton of filet mignon, 650 pounds of shrimp, 210 cases of scotch and
2,600 gallons of draft beer.
   Behind the merrymaking, authorities are concerned about
uncontrolled sex and a sharp increase of AIDS cases. Brazil, with
about 4,946 registered cases since 1980, is third in the world in
the number of AIDS cases after the United States and France.
   But as in the past, the undisputed highlight of this year's
Carnival will be Rio's ``samba school'' parade, held in two 15-hour

<HEAD>U.S. Official Says Marcos Is `Gravely Ill'</HEAD>

   A U.S. official who visited Ferdinand Marcos in
his hospital room said Saturday the former Philippine president
appears to be ``gravely ill.''
   ``It's fair to say that the reports previously in the news media
that he was in critical condition are absolutely true,'' said
William Craig, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
district director based in Honolulu.
   Craig is the first U.S. official to acknowledge seeing Marcos
since his latest hospitalization. Previous reports on Marcos'
condition were released by Marcos' doctors or spokesmen.
   Marcos remained listed in critical but stable condition Saturday
in St. Francis Medical Center's intensive care unit, said nursing
supervisor Ellen Cottingham.
   Marcos, admitted to the hospital Jan. 15, underwent a tracheotomy
Wednesday to drain fluids from his lungs and has been breathing
through a respirator since then. He was hospitalized twice in
December for congestive heart failure.
   Craig met with reporters Saturday after leaving the hospital. He
said he did not see Marcos on Saturday but did see the ailing
71-year-old exiled leader in his hospital bed Friday. He also said
he met with Marcos' doctors.
   ``From what I can ascertain he is certainly gravely ill and I
have been advised he will not be leaving the hospital for quite some
time,'' Craig said.
   Craig said Marcos didn't recognize him, adding, ``I just don't
think he could recognize anybody, really.''
   He said he went to the hospital in an official capacity, but
declined to say whether he had been ordered by his superiors to
visit Marcos.
   ``He is a parolee in the United States under my jurisdiction and
I have to do what I feel is required,'' Craig said.
   The INS announced in November it was conducting an inquiry into a
dinner honoring several of its officials, including Craig and
Western Regional Commissioner Harold Ezell, at Marcos' home
overlooking Honolulu. The dinner was held last Aug. 3.
   Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel visited Marcos Thursday
and said he came away convinced that Marcos was near death and
should be allowed to spend his last days in his homeland. Laurel
said Marcos had a fever of 103 and weighed less than 100 pounds.
   Marcos' attorneys have maintained that the former leader is too
ill to face trial on federal racketeering charges.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are under U.S. indictment for
allegedly plundering the Philippines of more than $100 million and
stashing much of the money in the United States.
   A federal judge in New York is to decide this month whether
Marcos is healthy enough to stand trial. Mrs. Marcos has pleaded
innocent and is free on $5 million bail.
   The Marcoses have lived in Hawaii since fleeing the Philippines
during a civilian-military revolt nearly three years ago.

   Former first lady Nancy Reagan's proposed drug
clinic passed its first test with a ruling that the center's
sponsors will not have to file an environmental impact report.
   The decision Friday by a city zoning official was good news to
center officials but frustrated residents who fear the center would
invite more crime to Lake View Terrace, a semirural section 10 miles
north of downtown.
   The Nancy Reagan Center would include treatment for up to 50
teen-agers who would live and attend school there.
   Nearby homeowners earlier this month picketed a welcome-home gala
for President and Mrs. Reagan with signs reading, ``If you really
care, put it in Bel-Air.'' The couple have moved into a home in the
exclusive Bel-Air district.
   Residents argued for an environmental impact report, which would
examine whether the proposed center was suitable for a residential
community.

<HEAD>Long-Running Musical Has Gala Finish</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first London production of ``Follies,'' Stephen
Sondheim's 1971 musical, came to a gala finish Saturday after a
19-month run that won extensive critical acclaim but made no money.
   ``You are seeing the last night of my dream to bring ``Follies''
to London,'' producer Cameron Mackintosh told the audience at the
conclusion of a performance marked by nostalgia, affection and
repeated ovations.
   Mackintosh gave special thanks to American director Harold Prince
``for putting it on in the first place.''
   His remarks ended a 10-minute standing ovation that also brought
onto the stage composer-lyricist Sondheim and the musical's
choreographer Bob Avian, both of whom had flown in from New York for
the evening.
   The musical at the Shaftesbury Theater told the story of two
former Follies showgirls and the stage-door Johnnies they married,
all of whom reconvene at a party in 1970 inside a Broadway theater
earmarked for demolition.
   At its July 21, 1987, bow, the London production starred Julia
McKenzie, Diana Rigg, David Healy, and Daniel Massey, with veteran
American performer Dolores Gray in the supporting role of Carlotta,
who sings the showstopper, ``I'm Still Here.''
   Directed by Mike Ockrent (``Me and My Girl'') and produced by
Cameron Mackintosh, the musical boasted four new songs by Sondheim
and a somewhat more upbeat finish from the original, which ended
with one character having a nervous breakdown.
   The new ``Follies'' was chosen Best Musical of 1987 at all three
of London's theater awards ceremonies.
   Three of the five principals stayed with the show throughout its
run. In July, Millicent Martin replaced Diana Rigg and Eartha Kitt
took over from Dolores Gray in a casting coup that has led to Kitt's
upcoming concert show at the same theater, starting March 13.
   One commentator, Brian Hunt in The Daily Telegraph, used the
closing of ``Follies'' to strike out Saturday at what he called
Sondheim's ``inflated reputation.''
   ``With Sondheim, we get all the glitter and glamor and still
remain aloof,'' wrote Hunt in an article entitled ``The trouble with
Stephen Sondheim.'' He said that ``In 13 musicals, only two songs
stand out as being beautiful and original.''
   Budgeted at $2.8 million, ``Follies'' repaid 60 percent of its
investment and was never the sellout smash of such other
Mackintosh-produced musicals as ``Les Miserables'' and ``The Phantom
of the Opera.''
   Despite winning seven Tony Awards, the original Broadway
engagement failed to recoup its investment which, at $800,000, was
hefty at the time.
   Present hopes are for a recast American production of ``Follies''
to start a national tour in the fall. No actors have been signed,
although Julie Andrews and Barbara Cook have been touted for the two
leading roles.

<HEAD>Government Announces New Investigation of Massacre</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army will reopen an
investigation into the massacre of 10 peasants, this time with a
panel that will not include the commander of the brigade accused of
the killings, officials said Saturday.
   Col. Emilio Chavez Caceres, commander of the 5th Army brigade in
San Vicente Province, played a key role in the initial investigation
that absolved his soldiers of responsibility in the killings last
year.
   The decision to reopen the investigation followed a Friday
meeting between the high command and visiting Vice President Dan
Quayle, who said the Bush administration is concerned about an
upswing in political violence in El Salvador, said a military
officer, who commented on condition of anonymity.
   A senior U.S. official who attended meetings during Quayle's
visit said the vice president hinted that if human rights conditions
are not improved, Washington may withhold some of the $400 million
in aid to the country.
   ``What does he have to say? No convictions (of implicated
officers), no money? That's too blunt. But there was no question he
was talking about aid,'' said the U.S. official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   El Salvador, a tiny country of 5.5 million people, has received
more than $3.5 billion in economic and military aid this decade _
more than any country in the Western Hemisphere. The aid is part of
the U.S. effort to help the government combat a 9-year-old leftist
insurgency.
   The army officer said the new investigation would be conducted by
a panel of high-ranking military officers.
   ``Rather than presuming innocence, the investigators will presume
guilt and those implicated will have to show they did not commit the
abuses,'' he said.
   On Sept. 21, soldiers of the 5th brigade's Jiboa Battalion
rounded up the residents of the hamlet of San Francisco, 27 miles
east of San Salvador and accused them of collaborating with rebels.
Seven men and three women were marched away and shots were heard in
the distance, according to witnesses.
   Forensic examinations showed the 10 were killed by point-blank
shots to the head.
   The army first claimed the ten were guerrillas killed in combat
but later said guerrillas attacked while the 10 were being marched
away. This version of the incident was upheld by the investigation
in which the soldiers' brigade commander took part.

   Rail traffic resumed Saturday through the
site of a train collision and explosion, but nearby residents found
repairing damage to their homes difficult with the high temperature
reaching only minus 18.
   A spokeswoman for Montana Rail Link Inc. said workers had cleared
portions of the wreckage and reopened one of the two tracks.
   The explosion Thursday morning of a railroad car containing
hydrogen peroxide shattered windows up to two miles away and hurled
debris hundreds of yards. Thousands of homes were without power for
several hours after the crash.
   Twenty-one runaway freight cars derailed in the collision with
three locomotives.
   About 2,000 people were evacuated from a square-mile area around
the blast as thick black smoke poured from a railroad car containing
plastics that ignited. The evacuation order was lifted Thursday
night, and many residents returned home to find broken windows,
frozen pipes and flooded basements.
   Officials of nearby Carroll College, whose buildings were damaged
by flying debris, asked residents to house about 200 students
temporarily. One dormitory will be closed for at least a month, and
classes won't resume until Feb. 13.
   Some families took refuge with friends or at local motels over
the weekend as they waited for repairs by plumbers, glaziers and
furnace-repair people, who said they were swamped with business.
   One plumber began turning away customers Thursday night, while a
second reported a waiting list of at least 15 customers by Friday.
   Sharon Prinzing, Montana Rail Link's personnel manager, said the
short-line railroad was recording names of claimants and planned to
work directly with insurance companies to settle the claims.
   One resident whose home was damaged said the railroad company
should immediately settle the claims.
   ``I'm going to have to come up with money, cash, for sleeping in
my own bed,'' said Wilbur Raymond. ``That's just not fair.''
   Raymond said several windows were shattered at his house,
including one in a solar greenhouse. Several citrus trees in the
greenhouse died, he said.
   About a dozen federal officials are investigating the accident.
They will examine the railroad cars to see whether the brakes failed
or were set improperly, and will talk with the four crew members
involved. Urine samples were taken from the crew members to test for
drugs and alcohol.
   The runaway cars were part of a freight train that stopped near
the Continental Divide to switch locomotives after a locomotive cab
heater failed. The cars slipped away during the switching procedure
and rolled nine miles before slamming into the three locomotives.

<HEAD>Husband Seeking Abortion For Comatose Wife Says She Would Approve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UPPER BROOKVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who is seeking a
court-sanctioned abortion for his comatose wife said Saturday he
believes she would approve of his actions.
   Martin Klein, 34, of Upper Brookville is awaiting a decision on
his petition seeking appointment as his wife's legal guardian so he
can authorize an abortion that he and some doctors say could help
her survive.
   ``It's been stressful,'' Klein said. ``It's been very
frustrating. I am doing what my wife would want me to do.''
   ``Inside they have ripped my guts out,'' he added. ``But my wife
deserves every chance she is entitled to, and I am going to do
everything in my power to see that she gets it.''
   Klein's 32-year-old wife, Nancy, is 17 weeks pregnant. She has
been in a coma at North Shore University Hospital in Manhassett
since she was injured in a car accident Dec. 13.
   The hospital refused to allow an abortion for Mrs. Klein unless
her husband is named her legal guardian.
   State Supreme Court Justice Bernard McCaffrey reserved a decision
Thursday on the case, described as unprecedented by legal and
medical experts, after a two-day hearing that drew supporters and
opponents of abortion.
   Klein, an accountant, said he had hoped the decision would be a
private one, as do his wife's parents, who support the decision to
terminate the pregnancy.
   ``We didn't want any publicity,'' said Klein, saying that if his
wife knew what was happening she, too, would be uncomfortable about
it.
   ``She is a very private kind of person,'' he said. ``I just want
to get the court order safe in my hands so we can at least resolve
one issue and get it behind us.''
   During the hearing, five medical experts for Klein testified that
pregnancy decreases the chances of recovery for the comatose patient
and could threaten her life.
   However, two other experts called by the Nassau County district
attorney testified that the pregnancy was not life-threatening. The
district attorney said he entered the case, in part, to ensure that
an abortion was not performed without consent.
   Klein visits his wife daily. She suffered extensive brain damage
and has been unconscious since the accident, but is not on
life-support machines.
   ``I talk to her,'' he said. ``I work with her arms and legs _
it's important that they don't get stiff. ... I just have to take
one day at a time.'' He said he has seen a slight improvement in his
wife's condition.
   The couple have a 3-year-old daughter, Arielle.
   ``For right now, I have to be strong for my family, my daughter
and my wife,'' Klein said.
   ``If I don't hold up, what will be left?''

   Five people were treated for frostbite and
hypothermia after a 500-mile journey in below-zero weather on an
unheated Greyhound bus, a passenger and hospital spokeswoman said.
   ``If it hadn't been for my blankets, I think we'd be in worse
condition than we are now,'' said Dan Clark of Missoula, Mont., who
said his daughter was treated for frostbite at St. Luke's
Hospitals-MeritCare after they arrived here Friday on the bus from
Billings, Mont.
   Deb Nelson, a hospital nursing supervisor, identified the child
Saturday as 4-year-old Janilynn. A total of five people from the bus
were treated for cold-related maladies and later released, according
to another supervisor, who declined to identify herself.
   The Forum newspaper of Fargo quoted one passenger as saying he
blacked out for a half-hour from hypothermia. He declined to
identify himself, the newspaper reported Saturday.
   Dale Bruggeman, a Greyhound supervisor in Fargo, said Saturday
that the bus' alternator failed at Forsyth, Mont., about 100 miles
east of Billings and 500 miles from Fargo. The malfunction left the
bus essentially without heat, he said.
   George Gravley, a spokesman at Greyhound Lines Inc.'s
headquarters in Dallas, said the 33 original passengers were invited
to transfer to a heated bus on four separate occasions along the
route.
   The first offer was made at Miles City, Mont., about 50 miles
east of Forsyth, Gravley said. The heated bus waited there for the
cold bus, 15 passengers transferred to it, and both buses traveled
together to Fargo, he said.
   Another five transferred 75 miles later at Glendive, Mont., he
said. After Glendive, the heated bus had standing room only, he
said, adding that no other buses were available.
   The third and fourth offers to transfer were made in Dickinson
and Sterling in North Dakota, but no one accepted, he said.
   ``That was their choice, stand on the warm bus or sit on the cold
bus,'' he said.
   Three passengers on the cold bus completed their trip and got off
at Bismarck, leaving 10 who arrived in Fargo on the cold bus,
Gravley said. He also said the driver had the authority to stop at
any time, but passengers did not protest and some maintained that
they were ``tough'' and urged the driver to continue.
   Bruggeman said some riders even wanted to move from the heated
bus to the cold one.
   Clark said the bus he took from Missoula to Billings also had no
heat.
   ``I'm cold and sick, and I'm going to have to tough it out,''
said Clark, who said he was returning to Fort Wayne, Ind., after
losing his truck-driving job in Missoula.
   Gravley denied that the second bus had a heating problem.
   The company is conducting an internal investigation into the
matter, he said.
   Billings' cold continued Saturday, hitting a record low of 22
degrees below zero.

<TEXT>
   Forces loyal to Gen. Andres Rodriguez
rounded up backers of the previous government Saturday to
consolidate his power after a violent coup. Reports linked the
nation's new leader to drug trafficking.
   Ousted President Alfredo Stroessner, who held power for 34 years,
was under house arrest awaiting exile two days after the overthrow
that reportedly left up to 300 dead.
   Onlookers cheered as portraits of Stroessner were taken down from
President Stroessner International Airport and from the headquarters
of the ruling Colorado Party.
   A high-level foreign diplomat described the 76-year-old dictator
as ``a sick and depressed old man.''
   But new Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana said Stroessner is
``in perfect health'' and living at the in the residence of a
colonel at Campo Grande, a base outside the capital.
   ``I don't know where he'll go,'' Argana told reporters. Visas are
being prepared for ``various countries,'' he said, declining to say
which.
   The new government intends to call elections, Argana added. He
did not say when.
   Rodriguez, who had been Stroessner's second-in-command, vowed to
restore democracy and respect human rights.
   A Western diplomat in Asuncion, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said reports are common in Paraguay that Rodriguez allows
cocaine traffickers to use an airstrip he owns in deserted Chaco
Province along the border with Bolivia. However, he said the reports
are unproven.
   John Hoyt Williams, a professor of Latin American history at
Indiana State University, said the drug smuggling allegations
against Rodriguez were common knowledge.
   ``It's appeared in print in a number of places. There's never
been an official indictment of him however,'' said Williams.
   The Cox newspaper group, citing a classified U.S. State
Department report, said Friday that Rodriguez is considered by law
enforcement authorities in Paraguay to be the country's No. 1 drug
trafficker.
   Rodriguez, the 65-year-old farmer's son, lives better than his
army salary would seem to allow. His house in a plush neighborhood
is a mansion with a fountain in the well-manicured front yard.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about U.S. reports
of Rodriquez's alleged drug ties, told reporters Friday, ``We won't
characterize our relationship to him at this point.''
   Forces loyal to Rodriguez, who was sworn in Friday, detained
about 20 Stroessner followers and aides, raising the total to about
50, according to the leader of an anti-Stroessner political group.
   Officers of Stroessner's presidential escort, who defended the
dictator after the coup began Thursday night, also were arrested. No
number was given.
   Argana said most of those detained have been released. He refused
to say how many people died in the coup, saying only, ``not as many
as rumored.''
   The Roman Catholic station Radio Caritas said up to 200 people
were killed in the fighting. A high-ranking foreign diplomat,
speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated fatalities at 300.
   Soldiers raided the house of Stroessner's justice minister,
Eugenio Jacquet, carting away boxes of documents, the radio
reported. It said Jacquet was en route home from Caracas, where he
represented Stroessner at the inauguration Thursday of President
Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela.
   The former interior minister and leder of the ruling Colorado
Party, Sabino Montanaro, was reportedly given shelter at the
Honduran Embassy.
   New details emerged about the coup.
   Rodriguez, whose First Army Corps is the biggest and
best-equipped in the 12,500-man army, apparently tried to arrest
Stroessner on Thursday as he dined at the home of a friend near the
corps' base.
   Stroessner's bodyguards resisted and he escaped to the escort
battalion, according to a witness who saw the exchange of gunfire.
   The witness said that after a battle at the barracks, he saw
Stroessner being driven off in his black Chevrolet between two tanks.
   Opposition groups said they hoped the transition boded new
opportunity for them.
   ``I consider the overthrow of that tyrant as the most positive
event in our country's political history over the last 40 years,''
said Luis Manuel Andrada Nogues, leader of the Christian Democratic
Party. Stroessner had refused to recognize the party.
   ``A year ago, we couldn't have held this meeting,'' Carlos Levi
Ruffinelli, leader of a small Liberal Party faction, told fellow
party members at his home Saturday.
   The Liberal Party, Paraguay's other main party besides the
Colorado Party, began efforts to patch together its many factions to
take on the Colorado Party in the event of elections.

<HEAD>Yusupov Defeats Spraggett In Sudden Death Playoff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUEBEC (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Artur Yusupov of the Soviet Union scored a
brilliant victory over Canada's Kevin Spraggett in a sudden-death
playoff Saturday to win their World Chess Championship Candidates
quarterfinal and advance to the semifinal stage.
   With both players' thinking time limited to one hour each for the
entire game, Yusupov, playing black, unleashed a dazzling queen
sacrifice on his 28th move to gain a crushing attack with his
remaining pieces against Spraggett's King.
   ``It was the best move in all the match.'' said Yves Boisvert, a
Canadian chess commentator.
   As Yusupov steadied his nerves and waited to deliver an
unstoppable checkmate on his 51st move, Spraggett ran out of time
and lost the game.
   ``I'm not disappointed. I lost, but I think I gave it my best,''
Spraggett told reporters at a joint news conference with his
opponent onstage at the playing hall in Quebec's Gabrielle-Roy
Library.
   Yusupov said Spraggett had proved his equal by holding him to a
4-4 tie over the eight games played before Saturday at a slower rate.
   After his victory, Yusupov rushed from the hall to tell his wife,
Tatiana, of the victory. Following Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, wives of Soviet Grandasters have, in the last months,
begun to travel to the west with their husbands.
   When the players came back to the stage, they received a standing
ovation of more than a minute from the disappointed, but
appreciative Canadian crowd.
   The winner of the Candidates, a series of knockout matches, will
challenge world champion Garri Kasparov for his title in 1990.
   Yusupov, a 28-year-old Muscovite joins British Grandmaster
Jonathan Speelman in the semifinals.
   Mark Dvoretsky, a Soviet international master who acts as
Yusupov's second, said Yusupov would probably play former world
champion and fellow Soviet Anatoly Karpov in the semifinals.
   Karpov is currently leading Iceland's Johann Hjartarson 3-1 in
the six-game duel underway in Seattle, and requires only one draw
from two games to win the contest.
   Speelman is likely to meet either Lajos Portisch of Hungary or
Dutch Grandmaster Jan Timman. Portisch is leading their contest in
Antwerp, Belgium 2-1 after three games.
   Robert Finta, the general director of the Quebec Chess Federation
who oragnized the contest with the support of Quebec's provincial
government said the players would split the $42,000 prize fund
becasue the match was tied after the initial six games.
   Both semifinals will be staged together in London in the autumn.
Each contest wil feature a prize $125,000, with five-eighths to the
winner and three-eighths for the loser.
   In a remarakable incident at the 1983 Candidates quarterfinal
between Robert Huebner of West Germany and former world champion
Vassily Smyslov of the Soviet Union in Velden Austria, organizers
turned to the roulettte table to break the tie.
   Huebner refused to attend, and on the first spin, the ball landed
on the zero.
   But on the second roll, the ball landed on red and gave Smyslov
victory. He went on to reach the Candidates final before being
knockout out by Kasparov.

<HEAD>Miswiring Found In Five 737's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inspections of Boeing jetliners ordered by the
Federal Aviation Administration have turned up five more cases of
miswiring in twin-jet Boeing 737s, a federal official said Saturday.
   The latest findings were wrong connections on fire extinguisher
bottles in engines on four Boeing 737s operated by Australian
airlines and a problem with an indicator light for an engine on a
737-300 operated by USAir.
   The indicator light problem involved an incorrect light going on
in the cockpit, not a wrong switch being activated, The Seattle
Times reported in Saturday's editions.
   Mitch Barker of the FAA's Seattle office said no more details
about the miswirings or the Australian airlines involved were
available.
   The inspection of about 740 Boeing 737s, 747s, 757s and 767s
built since 1981 was ordered by the FAA to put to rest concerns
about miswiring of fire-warning and fire-suppressant systems in
engines and cargo areas.
   Concerns about miswiring, or cross-wiring, arose during the
investigation of the Jan. 8 crash of a British Midland Airways
737-400 that killed 44 people. Investigators questioned whether
miswiring caused the pilot to shut down the wrong engine. The cause
of that crash has not been determined.
   Most foreign aviation agencies ordered their carriers to make
similar inspections.
   The inspections were advised previously by Boeing in
correspondence with its customers. Irregularities in 17 aircraft
have been reported in the past few weeks.
   Boeing also acknowledged this week that it had put decals
mislabeling wiring connectors on 10 737-300s and -400s that had been
delivered to customers in December and January.
   Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said none of those planes had
actually been miswired or had connections improperly made. He said
new decals were sent to the airlines.

<HEAD>Baker and Sihanouk Exchange Letters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, in an exchange of letters with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, has called on the United States to step up its efforts to
resolve the Cambodian conflict.
   ``We Cambodian patriots ask the United States to play a more
important and active role in the search for a fair solution to the
problem of Cambodia,'' Sihanouk said in his letter dated Friday and
seen Sunday.
   Sihanouk said he received the Baker letter earlier in the day
during a meeting with U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord. The
meeting took place at Beijing's state guesthouse, where Sihanouk is
staying.
   According to a copy of the Baker letter provided by Sihanouk,
Baker expressed U.S. ``appreciation for your indispensable
leadership in the valiant struggle of the Cambodian people to regain
their independence.''
   Baker said, ``without question, your leadership is crucial to
achieving an acceptable Cambodian settlement, both as the head of an
interim government preceding elections and as a symbol and focus for
the unity of your people.
   ``We consider it vital that you remain involved in the ongoing
diplomatic processes, and that your views be conveyed to all
involved parties at every opportunity.''
   Sihanouk leads one of three China-backed forces fighting
Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. China and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) want Sihanouk to head a coalition
government to take power after Vietnam's pullout, tentatively set
for September.
   The prince is thought to be the only man with broad enough
support to unify his nation, but his unpredictable diplomatic ploys
have also complicated efforts to resolve the conflict. He has on
several occasions resigned as president of the three-party
resistance government because of differences with his coalition
partners.
   Last month he announced he would boycott all further peace talks
because Hun Sen, prime minister of the Vietnam-backed government in
Phnom Penh, had rejected his proposals for introducing an
international peacekeeping force after Vietnam ends its 10-year
occupation.
   He has since modified his position, saying he will support any
unanimous agreements coming out of talks in Jakarta, Indonesia later
this month among the warring factions.
   Sihanouk was ousted in a 1970 coup he alleged was engineered by
the CIA. However, his faction now receives non-military aid from the
United States, which calls for an end to the Vietnamese occupation
and the holding of free elections in Cambodia.

   Some 3,000 Moslems marched in this
central English city Saturday to protest the book ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which they consider blasphemous.
   Demonstrators from around the country marched from Central Mosque
to Chamberlain Square in the city center, where they heard speeches
from religious leaders and delivered a protest petition to city hall.
   West Midlands police estimated the number of marchers at 3,000
and said the protest was peaceful.
   India and some Arab nations have banned Salman Rushdie's ``The
Satanic Verses,'' which is named after the verses the Prophet
Mohammed removed from the Koran _ the Islamic holy book _ on grounds
they were inspired by the devil.
   Copies have been burned at protests in the northern city of
Bradford, which has a large Moslem population, and last week
demonstrators marched in London and vowed to take legal action over
its publication.
   Indian-born Rushdie describes ``The Satanic Verses'' as a moral
parable about contemporary Britain and India.
   It has been a best-seller in Britain, won the Whitbread Novel
Award in 1988 and was runner-up for the prestigious Booker Prize.

<TEXT>
   Police raided city government offices
in East St. Louis, reportedly looking for evidence of official
misconduct in a community so broke it can't afford toilet paper in
City Hall.
   Illinois State Police served warrants at City Hall and spent the
day Friday seizing boxes of financial records, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   The raid, by agents of the state's Division of Criminal
Investigation, followed months of allegations that East St. Louis
officials were improperly using tax money, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch reported.
   The government of the impoverished city has found it increasingly
hard to function.
   City Hall restrooms have been without toilet paper and soap for
months. When light bulbs burn out, they are not replaced. Employees
wait between four and seven weeks for their paychecks, and vendors
routinely sue the city for non-payment.
   Mayor Carl E. Officer has acknowledged he has diverted some tax
money collected for specific purposes, including pensions, to pay
routine city bills. He defends the action, saying he has no choice.
   Some officials at City Hall appeared almost panicked when the
state police arrived Friday, the Post-Dispatch reported.
   According to complaints attached to the search warrants, the
investigation centers on allegations that:
   _The city has been diverting money collected for its employees'
pensions to its general fund.
   _The city owes more than $3 million to the pension fund; this
debt has endangered the pensions of city employees who will retire
in the future.
   _The city has been diverting motor fuel tax money that it gets
from the state. In October, the state cut off the money and ordered
the city to repay about $3 million that state audits determined the
city had misused.
   _Someone has been forging the signature of City Treasurer
Charlotte Moore on sewer lien releases. Thousands of dollars that
should have been paid to the treasurer's office and put into the
city's coffers have never arrived, Moore told state police.
   ``Legality does not seem to be a concern here'' at City Hall,
Moore said after the raid. ``It's a great concern of mine when
people are using my signature and it's not my signature.''
   No arrests were made, and no target of the investigation has been
identified. The investigation may continue for months, the newspaper
said, citing sources it did not identify.
   The mayor was attending a meeting in Atlanta and could not be
reached for comment, an aide said.
   St. Clair County State's Attorney John Baricevic, who requested
the three search warrants, refused to comment on the investigation.

   Thousands marched through West Berlin on Saturday
to protest policies of a radical right-wing political party that won
seats in a local election. In the northern city of Rotenberg,
right-wing demonstrators drew counter-protesters.
   ``Nazis Out of West Berlin!'' and ``Foreigners stay _ Nazis
away!''chanted protesters in the crowd estimated at nearly 10,000,
in the peaceful afternoon procession along Berlin's famed
Kurfuerstendamm.
   A right-wing extremist party, the Republicans, campaigned on an
arch-conservative platform that included a call to oust foreign
workers from the city.
   The party won 7.5 percent of the Berlin vote in ballotting last
Sunday, giving it 11 seats in the local parliament and the right to
send two representatives to the federal Bundestag next year.
   Their positions won broader support than pollsters predicted,
reflecting the volatile and growing nationalist sentiments stirred
by housing and job shortages that are especially acute in West
Berlin.
   However, moderate and left-wing supporters have staged a number
of protests against the Republicans and their policies since the
surprising election outcome.
   In Rotenburg near Bremen, 200 right-wing supporters demonstrated
for the the Free German Workers Party, drawing a counter-protest by
1,200 opponents. Four hundred police officers kept the displays
reasonably peaceful, with only one minor injury from a thrown rock
reported.

   President Bush and top advisers conferred for
more than 3{ hours on the savings and loan crisis Saturday, but the
president made no decisions, the White House said.
   The advisers _ including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,
Budget Director Richard Darman and Chief of Staff John Sununu _
traveled to the president's Camp David, Md., retreat for a working
session from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., said B. Jay Cooper, a presidential
spokesman.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan joined the group
for lunch, which broke up shortly after 2:30 p.m.
   ``Options were presented to the president. He made no decisions
at the meeting,'' Cooper said.
   Among proposals that were to have been presented to the president
were plans to raise $54 billion over three years through complicated
financing arrangements based largely on boosting deposit insurance
premiums paid by the institution, according to a report Saturday in
The New York Times.
   The plan would call for banks to pay 18 cents in insurance
premiums for every $100 in deposits, while savings and loans would
pay 25 cents per $100, according to unnamed congressional aides
cited by the newspaper. Banks currently pay 8 cents per $100 in
deposits, while S&amp;Ls pay 21 cents.
   Also, the Times' Sunday editions quoted industry officials as
saying the Bush administration is studying a proposal to take
control of the 350 insolvent savings and loan associations and place
them under the management of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Advocates argue that the FDIC, with 4,000 bank liquidators and a
reputation for toughness, would be better able to bring the problem
under control than the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which has a
smaller staff and is less experienced, the Times said.
   Member of the Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees S&amp;Ls, and the
FDIC chairman would have to approve the plan, but it would not take
an act of Congress, the Times said.
   The General Accounting Office on Thursday urged the government to
consider taking over the insolvent S&amp;Ls once an overall bailout plan
is devised.
   White House aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Friday that a controversial fee paid by bank and S&amp;L depositors
likely would not be a part of the package.
   Bush met with industry officials on Thursday and congressional
leaders Friday and said he would lay out his plan early this week.
He plans to include the subject in a nationally broadcast speech to
Congress on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   In a lurid Hollywood trial, Rock Hudson's
one-time lover has testified that the actor had unsafe sex with him
up to five times a week although he knew he had AIDS, and lied about
having the deadly disease.
   Hudson fiercely kept secret his homosexual life for more than 25
years before admitting he had AIDS in 1985.
   But during testimony in recent weeks, blond, clean-cut Marc
Christian, a 35-year-old unemployed bartender, has glaringly exposed
Hudson's love life.
   The trial stems from Christian's $11 million lawsuit against
Hudson's estate and the actor's former secretary, Mark Miller.
Christian alleges that he suffers extreme emotional distress for not
being told Hudson had AIDS.
   To prove his claim, Christian has testified that he and Hudson
engaged in unprotected oral and anal sex for eight months, three to
five times a week, after Hudson learned he had AIDS in June 1984.
   Christian said that although the actor lost weight rapidly,
developed neck sores and had profuse night sweats when they lived
together at Hudson's hilltop mansion _ all symptoms of AIDS _ he
denied he had the disease until shortly before his death in October
1985.
   Christian said he has tested negative for exposure to the AIDS
virus but lives in fear of contracting the disease and dying.
   Christian testified that he met Hudson in October 1982 and moved
in with him 13 months later. In June 1984, the actor learned he had
AIDS, but kept the illness a secret, Christian said.
   Attorneys for the Hudson estate and Miller contend the pair's
sexual relationship ended in February 1984 after Christian allegedly
told Hudson he had engaged in sex for money with women and other men.
   The attorneys contend that Hudson allowed Christian to continue
living in the actor's house until after his death because Christian
allegedly threatened to blackmail him by publishing love letters the
actor wrote.
   The defense has tried to portray Christian as a publicity-seeking
gigolo who filed the lawsuit after he learned he was left out of
Hudson's will.
   Christian said he feels like a leper because of his contact with
Hudson, the once-handsome screen idol who wooed the likes of Doris
Day, Elizabeth Taylor and Linda Evans in dozens of movie and
television roles.
   The trial has attracted spectators daily. But for those who may
have expected to hear about the glamour and excitement of one of
Hollywood's leading stars, the trial has yielded only the seamiest
of insight.
   Testimony has focused primarily on sex _ how much sex Christian
and Hudson had, what type they had, and, in questions from defense
lawyers, whether they had sex at all.
   Christian's attorney, Harold Rhoden, has repeatedly apologized to
the jury for his client's graphic testimony.
   The jury is expected to hear closing arguments in a few days.

   Subzero cold continued Saturday in the northern Rockies and
Plains, with heavy snow in the Rockies and Sierra Nevada, while
freezing rain fell as far south as the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
   The lowest official morning temperatures for the Lower 48 states
were 50 degrees below zero at Wisdom, Mont., 44 below at Butte,
Mont., and 41 below at Meacham, Ore.
   Helena, Mont., had its coldest morning for the month of February
since 1936, with a record low of 33 below zero.
   Other record lows for the date Saturday: 7 at Abilene, Texas, a
tie; minus 5 at Amarillo, Texas; 14 at Astoria, Ore.; minus 22 at
Billings, Mont.; minus 14 at Colorado Springs, Colo.; minus 29 at
Duluth, Minn.; 7 at Eugene, Ore.; minus 33 at Great Falls, Mont.;

Angelo, Texas, tie; 7 at Seattle; 2 at Tulsa, Okla.; 6 at Wichita
Falls, Texas, and 9 at Yakima, Wash.
   Patches of freezing rain and drizzle made roads hazardous along
coastal sections of Texas into parts of Louisiana. Bridges and
overpasses in the Corpus Christi and Galveston areas of Texas were
closed at times due to icing and wrecked cars.
   One to 2 feet of snow fell overnight in the Colorado Rockies and
the mountains of northern Utah, and up to 4 feet of new snow
accumulated in the mountains around Lake Tahoe on the
California-Nevada line. Heavy snow also fell in the mountains of
southern Wyoming.
   High wind and snow produced blizzard conditions in the mountains
of southern California, with gusts to 63 mph at Daggett and 58 mph
at Victorville. Snow also was reported in the Bakersfield area and
in northern San Luis Obispo County near the central California coast.
   Mount Wilson, Calif., received 2.28 inches of rain in the six
hours preceding 10 a.m. EST.
   Sections of the Southwest escaped the bitterly cold air. The
shallow layer of cold did not cross the Guadalupe Mountains of
southwestern Texas and southern New Mexico. Temperatures were in the
50s west of the mountains at El Paso, Texas, and Alamogordo, N.M.,
on Saturday, while readings east of the mountains were in the 20s at
Carlsbad, N.M., and Roswell, N.M.
   In the East, the arctic cold front moved through most of the
Carolinas, putting an end to 80-degree weather, and afternoon
temperatures were below freezing from Virginia into New England.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 27
degrees below zero at Helena, Mont., to 85 at Vero Beach, Fla.
   For Sunday, scattered light snow was forecast from the central
Plains and eastern Oklahoma across the middle Mississippi Valley,
the Ohio Valley and southern sections of the Great Lakes to the
middle and northern Atlantic Coast; snow mixed with sleet and
freezing rain from southern and eastern Texas across northern
Louisiana to northern Mississippi; sleet mixed with snow across much
of Virginia, with showers over the central Gulf Coast, and over
parts of Georgia and the Carolinas; and snow, occasionally heavy,
for central and southern sections of the Rockies and the
Intermountain region between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada.
   Highs between 10 below zero and 10 above zero were predicted from
the northern Rockies across the northern and central Plains, and the
upper Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes; in the 30s and
40s from southwestern Oregon across northern and interior
California, northern Arizona, much of New Mexico to southwestern and
south-central Texas, and from the central Gulf Coast across the
southern Appalachians to the mid-Atlantic Coast; in the 50s from
coastal and southern California to the desert Southwest; in the 50s
and 60s over much of South Carolina and Georgia; in the 70s and 80s
across Florida; and in the teens and 20s elsewhere.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze arrived here early Sunday for talks on Afghanistan as
the Red Army headed home after nine years of intervention in the
country's civil war.
   Shevardnadze said he would conduct ``intense negotiations'' with
Pakistani officials before his departure Sunday afternoon, but he
did not respond to reporters' questions on whether he would meet
with Pakistan-based guerrilla leaders.
   His visit capped a week of diplomatic efforts to bring
Afghanistan's warring factions to terms as Moscow prepares to pull
all its troops out by Feb. 15, ending a massive military involvement
that began in December 1979 to prop up the Marxist government in
Kabul.
   With the last units reportedly on their way home, there still are
no prospects for peace between the Kabul government and guerrillas
armed by the United States and Pakistan.
   ``The Soviet leadership has decided to consult with the
government of Pakistan on how best to contribute to restoring peace
and tranquility in Afghanistan,'' Shevardnadze told reporters on his
arrival at Islamabad airport.
   ``Problems have been piling up. There are quite a few of them,''
he said, speaking through an interpreter.
   Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan, head of the United Nations' relief
effort for Afghanistan, arrived in the Pakistani capital Saturday
with an appeal to Afghan combatants to ``give peace a chance.''
   He told reporters at the airport that he would meet with
Pakistani officials and Pakistan-based guerrilla leaders, then later
fly to Kabul to coordinate an airlift of emergency food and other

   Soviet forces entered Afghanistan in 1979 to replace one Marxist

   A 17-year-old girl from the Soviet Ukraine has
been found to fit the medical criteria for a heart-lung transplant,
officials said.
   Oksansa Klebkyna's name will be placed on a waiting list for
donor organs at the Arizona Heart Institute here, the officials said.
   She arrived here several weeks ago to see if American doctors
could repair her heart, which has been defective since birth.
   Doctors at the institute said Thursday the chambers of her heart
were malformed and that only a heart-lung transplant could save her
life. Doctors said her lungs had been irreparably damaged by years
of extremely high blood pressure.
   Dr. Edward Diethrich and Humana Hospital Phoenix have agreed to
donate the surgery.
   Heart-lung donations can only come from brain-dead patients on
life-sustaining machines, doctors said, adding that the donor would
have be about the same physical size as the girl and have a
compatible immune system and blood type.

   A newly restored version of the epic film
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' scheduled to open here later this week,
previewed Saturday before a star-studded audience that included the
movie's leading actors, Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole, and its
director, David Lean.
   The movie, which originally opened in 1962, tells the story of
Lawrence's strategy in guiding the 1917-1918 Arab revolt against the
Ottoman Empire. O'Toole plays Lawrence and Sharif plays his friend
Ali.
   The restored version lengthens the film by about 20 minutes to
about four hours, adding transitional passages, scenes in which the
British military plots its strategy, and scenes that add to the
viewer's understanding of Lawrence's personality.
   Saturday's screening, a benefit for the American Film Institute,
also was attended by stars such as Sylvester Stallone and Donald
Sutherland and director Steven Spielberg.

<HEAD>Vice President Appeals for Marcos to be Allowed Back</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs of Aquino statement refusing to meet privately

   Vice President Salvador Laurel
returned Saturday from a visit with ailing Ferdinand Marcos and
appealed to President Corazon Aquino to let the man she ousted die
in his homeland.
   Mrs. Aquino on Sunday refused to meet with Laurel as he
requested, and she said he should ``share with the Filipino people''
the results of his visit to Marcos instead of disclosing it to her
first, a presidential palace statement said.
   ``President Aquino felt that there should be nothing secret in
what Mr. Marcos sought to convey to her,'' said the statement.
   Mrs. Aquino had disavowed Laurel's trip, which Laurel said he
made at Marcos' request.
   Laurel's relations with Mrs. Aquino have been strained since he
quit as foreign minister over policy differences in 1987. In August,
he accused Mrs. Aquino of incompetence, demanded her resignation,
and joined an opposition alliance.
   Laurel said he was appealing to Mrs. Aquino's ``sense of
Christian and moral values'' to allow Marcos to return. He said
doctors at Honolulu's St. Francis Medical Center told him Marcos had
lost the will to live and may not last through the year.
   Marcos, admitted to the hospital Jan. 15, underwent a tracheotomy
Wednesday to drain fluids from his lungs and has been breathing
through a respirator since then. He was hospitalized twice in
December for congestive heart failure.
   Laurel said that when he met Marcos for 35 minutes, the
71-year-old former president had a fever of 103 and weighed less
than 100 pounds. At times Marcos could not speak or recognize
visitors, he said.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return for security
reasons because the former president still enjoys a substantial
following in the Philippines.
   Marcos has been living in Honolulu since a military-civilian
uprising toppled his 20-year regime and swept Mrs. Aquino to power
in February 1986.
   On Saturday, the Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted Cabinet
Secretary Jose de Jesus as saying the government would even refuse
to allow Marcos to be buried in the Philippines.
   Before Laurel left Thursday, unconfirmed newspaper reports said
he and a Filipino businessman were trying to work out a deal to let
Marcos return in exchange for giving back part of the billions of
dollars he is accused of embezzling.
   Asked if Marcos made such an offer, Laurel replied he was ``not
at liberty to answer that.'' He told another reporter no offer was
made.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are under U.S. indictment, accused
of plundering the Philippines of more than $100 million and stashing
much of it in the United States. They would need permission from the
U.S. District Court in New York to leave the United States.

   Parade-watchers and party-goers bundled up
Saturday against a suddenly cold Carnival weekend, the start of a
four-day spectacle expected to draw nearly 2 million merrymakers by
Mardi Gras.
   Nine parades rolled Saturday in metropolitan New Orleans,
including the extravagant Endymion with huge floats and celebrity
riders such as Fred Savage, the child television star of ``The
Wonder Years,'' and pop singers Daryl Hall and John Oates.
   New Orleans police estimated this will be the biggest Mardi Gras
ever, with 1.7 million revelers lining the streets and jamming the
French Quarter on Fat Tuesday, the last blowout before the solemn
season of Lent. Authorities said 1.5 million people attended the
1988 celebration.
   Police reported few problems during the parades Saturday, which
drew thousands of revelers. The lone injury was a float rider who
required stitches after she was hit in the head by an undetermined
object during an all-women's parade.
   The day was cloudy, cold and damp, with temperatures in the 40s
and chilling winds. The National Weather Service said an arctic air
mass would drop temperatures into the 30s through Tuesday, but that
didn't deter Saturday night's parade-stalkers.
   ``The crowd is really just as big as normal. As long as it
doesn't rain, they'll come out,'' said Hilda Ramsey, desk clerk at
the Hummingbird Hotel, along the Endymion route.
   Some roisterers sought internal and external warmth in bars along
oak-lined St. Charles Avenue, a major parade route.
   ``They're here anyway and they're going to go drinking,'' said
Matt Hendricks at Fat Harry's. ``Instead of standing outside, it
just gets packed inside. The cold weather makes no difference.''
   For others visitors, there were worse things to deal with than
the damp, winter weather _ the city's notorious hard-line parking
regulations and always-ready tow trucks.
   ``I thought my car was stolen,'' said Jeff Jacob of Memphis,
Tenn., whose rental car was town away before a parade earlier this
week.
   ``But after they checked the license, they told me, `We have it.'
I couldn't believe it,'' he said.
   The New Orleans Streets Department begins towing two hours before
parade time. Signs in Carnival colors of purple, green and gold
alert drivers to the financial hazards of blocking parade routes.
   For some University of Florida students, the problem wasn't cars,
it was hotel space.
   When 10 buses from Gainesville pulled up to the Days Inn in
suburban Kenner on Friday, nearly 200 of the 600 students learned
they didn't have a place to sleep.
   ``We had all made our commitments to come here _ paid the travel
agency for everything in full,'' said student Bill McClure. ``But
somewhere along the way, somebody screwed up.''
   Five hours later, Days Inn Manager Robert Murphy and Gator Travel
owners Jim and John Fahlen found 15 rooms to handle 60 students,
while the rest were put in rooms that already held two students each.

   Anti-abortion protests Saturday in south Florida and St. Louis
resulted in more than 130 arrests, police said.
   In Oakland Park, Fla., 107 people who blocked the entrance to the
Women's Clinic were arrested, but the demonstrators were freed
within hours on their own recognizance, an organizer said.
   Demonstrators were carried off by police, charged with
trespassing and unlawful assembly and booked at the Broward County
Jail, said Katie Mahoney, spokeswoman for Rescue South Florida, the
rally organizer.
   Police said about 100 arrests were made but could not give a
specific number. No violence was reported.
   The Women's Clinic closed for a few hours during the
demonstration.
   In St. Louis, police said they arrested more than two dozen
people who attempted to block the entrance to the parking lot at the
Reproductive Health Services clinic. They declined to disclose the
exact number of arrests.
   The protesters laid down in a driveway to block cars attempting
to get into the lot, but police picked them up and put them into a
van. About 30 officers formed a shield around the front door of the
clinic, keeping the protesters away from the entrance.
   Several hundred pro-choice demonstrators marched past the health
center during the protest, but there was no confrontation.
   The protest came on the final day of a three-day event that the
St. Louis Pro-Life Direct Action League called ``Rescue St. Louis.''
Thirty-eight protesters were arrested during a demonstration Friday
at a medical office complex.

   President Carlos Andres Perez on
Saturday urged Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to step down as commander
of the Panamanian Defense Forces and ruler of the nation.
   In his first press conference since being sworn in as president,
Perez said the next elections in Panama, scheduled for mid-year,
``should not be a farce ... but must really signify the sovereign
expression of the will of the Panamanian people.''
   He also said that Noriega, who by law should have retired last
year after 25 years in the army, ``could do Panama and Latin America
a great service by resigning his military power when the
Constitution and the Panamanian laws order him to do so.''
   Perez said he saw ``no possibility'' of Panama's rejoining the
Group of Eight unless Noriega, the de facto leader of Panama, steps
down and the country goes forward with democratic reforms.
   The group is made up by Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, Brasil,
Uruguay, Argentina and Peru. Panama was suspended in 1988 after
Noriega ousted the elected president from power.
   The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Panama to
pressure Noriega to step down.

   Two separate fires believed to have both
started in chimneys killed four people and critically injured a
fifth person early Saturday in this Grand Rapids suburb, authorities
said.
   The fires broke out within a 2{-hour period in homes of nearly
identical construction located about two miles apart, Fire Chief
Bill Thornton said. Both apparently began in chimneys, he said.
   ``The layout of the houses are identical. The interiors were
built the same; the stairways in the same way; the victims were
found in the same location of (each) house,'' Thornton said. ``There
were a lot of coincidences.''
   The first blaze killed Theresa Porter, 32; her 3-year-old son,
Andrew, and 13-month-old daughter, Jennifer, officials said. The
woman's husband, Hugh, was not home at the time.
   The victim of the second fire was identified as Dolores Berggren,
35. Her husband, David, 49, rescued their two young daughters before
being admitted to Blodgett Memorial Medical Center in Grand Rapids,
where he was listed in critical condition Saturday night with burns
over 70 percent of his body.

<TEXT>
   Telephone party lines and dial-a-date numbers are
being banned in Britian, where critics say teen-agers may be too
hung up on the costly social calls.
   British Telecom, the telephone company, ended its own service a
year ago and announced Friday that it was indefinitely suspending
the other privately run ``chatlines'' effective Monday.
   ``We have taken this action in the public interest following
acute and growing public concern over chatlines, which we feel has
brought the whole service into disrepute,'' said a company statement.
   Critics of the party lines _ with which people can call a number
and speak to like-minded strangers _ welcomed news of the cutoff but
expressed worry over those in debt to the telephone company.
   Costs for the services were 66 cents per minute during peak hours
and 44 cents per minute during off-peak times. Newspapers have
printed stories of parents facing phone bills of $5,000 to $10,000
run up by their children.
   Although British Telecom said it could not waive high bills ``we
will work out a way in which an account can be paid which is best
for the family,'' said Duncan Lewis, director of products and
strategy.
   The Independent Chatline Association, which represents most of
the 100 companies providing the services, was holding emergency
talks to consider the news.
   British Telecom was privatized in 1984 but remains the country's
main telephone company, with monopoly privileges and a near-monopoly
on services.
   A final decision on the party lines, which are enjoying wide
popularity in the United States, is expected after the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission publishes the results of a study on Feb. 28.

   An Alaskan cold front nearly completed its conquest of the lower
48 states today, putting highways on ice, chilling Mardi Gras
festivities and making weather forecasters the target of some
cabin-fever abuse.
   Frigid air pushed south and east, bringing subzero wind chills to
normally balmy south Texas, coating New York City and Philadelphia
with freezing rain and sending temperatures plunging across Georgia,
Louisiana and Alabama.
   By Sunday, the National Weather Service said, the arctic air is
expected to reach central Florida, completing the southeastward
march that began in Alaska about a week ago. Heavy snow fell in the
Rockies and the Sierra Nevada, and temperatures remained well below
zero across much of the nation's midsection. So far, at least 16

<HEAD>Major Gauguin Retrospective Opens in Paris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 300 works by Paul Gauguin, the French painter
who rejected the comforts of middle-class life to pursue art in the
Polynesian wild, have gone on show at the Grand Palais in the first
major retrospective of his work in 40 years.
   ``Gauguin,'' running through April 24, is a $2 million
co-production with the Art Institute of Chicago and the Washington
National Gallery of Art, which presented slightly different versions
of the show last year.
   The French have not had a comprehensive look at Gauguin since
1949, and they have wholeheartedly embraced his works. The show has
been billed as the blockbuster art event of the season, daily
drawing some 6,000 visitors.
   Critics say the show's highlight are 11 paintings on loan from
the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad and Moscow's Pushkin Museum, which
rarely leave the Soviet Union.
   They include ``Pastorales Tahitiennes'' (1892), a brightly
colored bucolic scene which Gauguin believed to be his ``best''
Tahitian effort.
   With its flat surface, exotic flowers and sensuous women in
native dress, the work sums up the essence of Gauguin. The distorted
perspective and bold use of color, which he once called a
``profound, mysterious language, a language of the dream,'' would
later influence works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and other 20th
century masters.
   The show begins with Gauguin's early work, including such
paintings as ``Effet de Neige'' (1883), a wintery village scene
reminiscent of Claude Monet's ``La Pie.''
   In the early years, when working as a respectable stockbroker and
painting on the weekends, Gauguin tried to master impressionist
techniques. Later, reacting against realism, he would reject them
altogether, opting instead for mystery and exoticism.
   Gauguin sought a primitive naturalness where ever he went and
became dependent on it for stimulation.
   In 1886 he left Paris for Pont-Aven in Brittany. There his eye
focused on the elaborate head pieces worn by the native women.
   Two years later, he went to Arles, in southern France, where he
painted the same sun flowers and haystacks Van Gogh immortalized.
Later, during two different stays in the South Pacific, he would
depict the tribal rituals and superstitions of ``true savages.''
   Besides bringing together so many remarkable paintings executed
after 1895 when he left France never to return, the Paris exhibition
features two important works not displayed in Washington or Chicago.
   In ``The Vision After the Sermon _ Jacob Wrestling With the
Angel'' (1888), Gauguin experimented with pure color and reduced all
forms to their outlines. In ``Papa Moe'' (1893) he portrayed a
native woman drinking water from a jungle source against a lush
backround of tropical flora and fauna.
   Also on show is ``Aita Tamari Vahine Judith Te Parari''
(1893-94), a bizarre portrait of a naked Polynesian adolescent
posing with an orange monkey. Anna the Javanese, as she was known,
was 13 years old when she became Gauguin's mistress and accompanied
him back to France from the South Pacific after his first stay there.
   On a visit to Brittany, the flamboyantly dressed Gauguin, Anna
and her monkey were laughed at by sailors, prompting the artist to
pick a fight. He sustained a broken foot and was bedridden for
weeks. Anna left him, returned to Paris and robbed his studio of
paintings and other valuables, leaving him practically destitute.
   The show ends on an optimistic note: the monumental door frame
sculpted in redwood and taken from the hut in the remote South
Pacific island of Marquesas where Gauguin died miserable and alone
in 1903 at the age of 55.
   Carved with flowers and nude native women, it bears the
inscription ``The House of Pleasure,'' and sums up Gauguin's life
credo: ``Be in love, and you will be happy.''

<HEAD>For Mexico's Cartoonists, The President Is Mickey Mouse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president, the military and the Virgin of
Guadalupe used to be off-limits for Mexican political cartoonists.
Now only the generals and the Virgin are taboo.
   The best of Mexico's cartoonists say what others can't _ or
won't. Their razor-sharp commentaries sparkle on gray pages awash in
windy pro-government prose.
   ``They are in the vanguard of free expression in Mexico,'' said
Carlos Monsivais, one of Mexico's most outspoken, acerbic social
analysts. ``They get away with things I never could.''
   The political ferment of 1988, a year of unprecedented losses at
the polls for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, sparked
a wave of graphic daring.
   More than one artist has depicted Mexico's diminutive, jug-eared,
balding new chief executive, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, as a
Disneyesque rodent named Mickey.
   ``They are tough, very tough,'' Monsivais said approvingly,
although President Salinas seems to be getting a bit more cartoon
respect than he did as candidate and president-elect.
   Jerry Robinson, head of the New York-based Cartoonists and
Writers Syndicate, agrees that something special is afoot.
   ``Mexico has a fantastically high number of exceptional
cartoonists,'' said Robinson, who syndicates many of Mexico's best.
``They are high-caliber graphic artists. It makes their work very,
very effective.''
   Rogelio Naranjo's razor-sharp pen has been on the cutting edge
for years. Day by day, stroke by ironic stroke, Naranjo has chiseled
away at the pretensions, foibles, hypocrisies and taboos that have
buttressed a one-party government for 60 years. He's honed a sixth
sense for what he can get away with in his 22 years of political
cartooning.
   ``It's like a mystical thing in my work. I navigate the line that
divides what is possible and what isn't,'' he said. When it comes to
government policy, now ``there are very few limits.''
   Government austerity programs and Mexico's crippling foreign debt
provoke some of the bitterest commentary.
   Naranjo resorted, literally, to gallows humor, depicting a plump
man representing the World Bank picking the pocket of a starved,
barefoot and hanged worker.
   Bulmaro Castellanos, who draws under the monicker Magu, showed
Salinas, architect of an austerity pact that controlled wages and
prices, as a crazed workman armed with a chainsaw standing over a
bloody body skewered by the pact.
   The generals are another story. Both official censorship and
self-censorship have a long history in Mexico, where few care to
rouse the military and endanger decades of civilian rule.
   ``The army is the most taboo thing,'' Naranjo said. ``Everyone
assumes the army is a great power in Mexico that can influence the
government in a radical and substantial manner.''
   As for the Virgin of Guadalupe, even Naranjo, who has lampooned
the pope, says such a revered symbol cannot be used to make a point.
A museum exhibit that included irreverent paintings of Mexico's
patron saint was shuttered after a public outcry.
   Although most of their satire is directed at the ruling
establishment, the cartoonists do take occasional pokes at the
opposition. Efren Maldonado showed opposition leader Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas as a giant head supported by a magic carpet in the image of
former President Lazaro Cardenas, Cuauhtemoc's father and a national
hero.
   Cartoonists such as Naranjo and Helio Flores began stretching the
limits of the possible as founders of the cheeky humor magazine La
Garrapata in 1968, a year of political upheaval in much of the
world, including Mexico.
   ``The notion of reverence disappeared,'' Monsivais said.
   In a show of impatience with the one-party status quo, thousands
took to the streets. The unrest lasted only a few months, until the
army opened fire on a demonstration in Mexico City, killing scores.
   Not long after the massacre, La Garrapata co-founder Eduardo del
Rio, who signs himself Rius, was kidnapped by uniformed men and
forced to stand next to an empty grave in front of what turned out
to be a mock firing squad.
   Subsequent administrations began slowly opening a safety valve
that included tolerance for press freedom.
   The Mexican chief executive was traditionally above reproach, no
matter how unpopular. Even now Maldonado, the first cartoonist to
put Dumbo ears on Salinas, insists he intends no disrepect.
   Flores remembers a cartoon of President Jose Lopez Portillo, who
left office to almost universal relief in 1982. ``He was drawn as
Hamlet _ but very, very handsome, very athletic,'' Flores said.
   With Salinas, cartoonists have gone far beyond making fun of his
ears and his austere economics, attacking the very legitimacy of his
presidency. His election was marred by accusations of fraud and
Cardenas still claims that he won.
   The most audacious cartoons appear in El Universal, a mainline
newspaper that gave significant space to the opposition in 1988, and
in two publications born after 1968: La Jornada, a liberal daily,
and the feisty weekly Proceso.
   But both Naranjo and Flores, who just won his second Gran Prix
from the International Salon of Cartoon, say even El Universal
sometimes refuses a cartoon it considers too daring.
   After the July 6 presidential election, which many say the ruling
party rigged, Flores did a sketch portraying Salinas as Dr.
Caligari, the eerie protagonist of a classic silent horror film.
   El Universal rejected it without explanation, he said. The
cartoon later ran in an opposition paper.

<HEAD>Largest Bailout Ever: A Ride for Taxpayers or Best Deal Possible?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The savings and loan crisis represents the
largest government bailout in history, an estimated $85 billion
rescue that has raised a multitude of questions over whether
taxpayers are being taken for a ride.
   Critics contend the bailouts negotiated by the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board are huge government giveaways with generous benefits for
the purchasers of sick S&amp;Ls that will saddle taxpayers with billions
of dollars of open-ended obligations.
   Board Chairman M. Danny Wall disputes those charges, saying the
agency, which regulates the country's 3,000 S&amp;Ls, is doing the best
it can to handle a gigantic problem with limited resources.
   In December, the bank board negotiated deals involving 75
bankrupt S&amp;Ls in a year-end frenzy spurred by the fact that
lucrative tax benefits available to the buyers were to be slashed in
half on Jan. 1.
   The $16.7 billion in government aid promised in December alone
dwarfed the combined $2.8 billion handed out to Chrysler Corp. and
New York City, the two previous record holders as the largest
government bailouts.
   To attract buyers, the government included such sweeteners as:
   _Multimillion-dollar tax breaks to some of the country's
wealthiest investors that in many cases have far exceeded what the
investors put up to purchase the S&amp;Ls.
   _Government guarantees extending over the next decade that make
many of the purchases virtually risk-free to the new S&amp;L owners.
   _Lucrative pay packages, which in one case will provide the
manager of a conglomeration of failed Texas S&amp;Ls with a salary of $1
million a year for the next five years.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, calls the deals, with their big tax
breaks, a ``back-door raid on the U.S. Treasury.''
   ``One of the impressive aspects of these deals is that an
outsider can march in with very little capital and utilize
substantial tax benefits,'' Leach said. ``If the thrift investment
works, the outsider makes a riskless killing. If it doesn't, because
of the nature of deposit insurance, the outsider has the right
simply to walk away.''
   With the government, once more, left holding the bag.
   Charles O. Bowsher, head of the watchdog General Accounting
Office, told Congress the bailouts are so complex that just
monitoring them will strain the bank board's resources.
   All of the controversy is coming as the Bush administration and
Congress are trying to find a way to pay for the bailouts, past and
future. The GAO estimates that in the deals negotiated so far,
including 205 institutions closed in 1988, regulators have spent or
promised to spend $26 billion more than they will take in over the
next decade. The GAO projects that $35 billion more will be needed
to handle 350 insolvent institutions still operating.
   In a report last week, the GAO recommended that the government
move promptly to take control of the remaining insolvent S&amp;Ls to
isolate them from the healthy part of the industry.
   For years, badly managed S&amp;Ls were allowed to remain open because
federal regulators didn't have the money to close them and pay off
depositors. All the while, the eventual bailout costs to the federal
government were mounting by $1 billion a month.
   It is this crunch that has left the bank board, which regulates
S&amp;Ls but not banks, scrambling to craft inventive ways to handle the
mess.
   Consider a medium-sized S&amp;L with $1 billion in assets and $2
billion in liabilities. The assets are home mortgages and real
estate loans, the stocks in trade of an S&amp;L. The liabilities are
depositors' savings. The institution is insolvent, with a negative
net worth of $1 billion.
   If the bank board closed the S&amp;L, the government would have to
pay out $2 billion immediately to depositors, who are protected by
federal insurance. Regulators would hope to recover the $1 billion
representing the failed institution's assets as it collected loan
payments and sold off repossessed properties.
   This traditional approach, still used by regulators of the
nation's 13,000 banks, requires huge up-front payments while waiting
years to recoup part of the expense.
   That is a luxury S&amp;L regulators don't have because their
insurance fund, unlike the bank fund, is busted. Instead, the bank
board has hit upon a strategy that for the first time makes the
government the guarantor not only of deposits but of bad loans as
well.
   Instead of taking over bad debts, the board is leaving them with
the new institutions and guaranteeing the new owners certain profit
levels for managing the soured loans.
   The bank board's bailout strategy features these elements:
   _PROMISSORY NOTES. These notes are provided by the board to bring
an institution's net worth back up to zero. For an institution with
a $1 billion negative net worth, that would mean pumping up its
assets with a $1 billion promissory note. The notes, which are
typically for 10 years, often carry an interest rate 2 percentage
points higher than the cost that other financial institutions in the
region are paying to obtain funds.
   For many new institutions, their biggest single asset is a
government note. In 1988, the bank board issued $14 billion in
promissory notes and now has more than $20 billion in such notes
outstanding.
   _GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES. In its year-end rush to close deals, the
bank board agreed to protect new owners against losses on old loans
over a 10-year period. These guarantees include ``capital loss
coverage,'' whereby the government agrees to cover any losses on the
book value of a loan when it is eventually sold, and ``yield
maintenance agreements,'' in which the government promises to make
up any loss of interest income on loans.
   Many of the agreements covered every loan in a failed S&amp;L except
for still-performing mortgages on single-family homes. These
guarantees carried a price tag of $18 billion last year.
   _TAX BREAKS. The board's assistance in the form of promissory
notes and guarantees is tax free. In addition, S&amp;L purchasers have
been allowed to deduct bad loans that had not been written off the
failed institution's books.
   Congressional critics have complained because these tax
write-offs can be carried from the acquired S&amp;L to the investors'
other businesses. Corporate takeover specialist Ronald O. Perelman,
the head of Revlon cosmetics, came away with tax breaks worth $900
million in his purchase of a group of failed Texas S&amp;Ls, three times
the capital he put into the deal. In all, the bank board dealt away
$5 billion in tax breaks for 1988.
   Beyond the tax breaks, the bank board projects that the Perelman
deal will cost the government $5.1 billion, including $2.9 billion
in loan guarantees.

   Included in the Perelman agreement was authorization to pay
Dallas banking executive Gerald J. Ford $1 million annually to
manage the newly created institution, First Gibraltar Bank. That
deal left lawmakers fuming. Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said,
``The public will not stand for that kind of salary because,
indirectly, it's taxpayer money.''
   Revelations such as these have prompted six congressional
committees to launch investigations. The GAO is sifting through the
deals and one court suit has already been filed by disappointed
bidders alleging the government acted improperly.
   But bank board officials insist they have put together the best
deals possible, maintaining that the favorable terms were necessary
to attract new capital and new investors into the troubled industry.
   ``I would rather be criticized for having acted than not having
acted,'' Wall says.
   Critics contend that the bank board deals are a recipe for
disaster. The new owners don't have a lot of capital in the deals
or, often, much experience in running S&amp;Ls. In some cases, the
failed S&amp;Ls were turned over to home builders or real estate
developers with an inherent conflict of interest in running a
financial institution.
   Some critics say Congress should not approve the money to mop up
the S&amp;L mess without changing the bank board's rules.
   The GAO said the board's current approach, with its heavy use of
government subsidies, could actually worsen the problem by making it
more difficult for marginal S&amp;Ls to survive without the subsidies.
   Lowell L. Bryan, a financial analyst for McKinsey &amp; Co., Inc.,
warns that the board's flood of deals has created a ``new interest
group of rich, powerful individuals who will fight to protect the
sweetheart deals they have struck,'' further complicating
congressional efforts to resolve the crisis.
   As if those weren't enough problems, some in the industry worry
that the bank board deals will work only if the record peacetime
economic expansion continues.
   ``These deals were built on certain assumptions on interest rates
and economic conditions and if those turn south, you could have a
second round of failures,'' said Mark Riedy, president of the
National Council of Savings Institutions, an industry lobbying group.

<HEAD>Despite Regulatory Actions, S&amp;L Crisis Far From Over In Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To assess the size of the savings and loan problem
in Texas, you need only look at the skyline of Boston.
   Boston? The Massachusetts capital has 39 million square feet of
office space downtown. In the Dallas area alone, almost an equal
amount of office space is empty, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a
real estate research firm.
   Much of that real estate is now foreclosed and owned by the
state's savings and loans, and the dead space remains one of the
biggest problems for the nation's struggling thrift industry.
   Despite last year's rescue of nearly one-third of Texas' thrifts,
the savings and loan business won't rebound, experts say, until the
state's economy recovers and tenants start to fill up all those
empty, money-guzzling buildings.
   It could take years.
   ``Unfortunately, their (S&amp;Ls) greatest exposure is to the weakest
segment of the Texas economy,'' said Alex Sheshunoff, an Austin,
Texas, banking expert. ``It's a bit of a spiral.''
   Half the repossessed assets now owned by the nation's S&amp;Ls is in
the Lone Star state. Texas savings and loans own so much repossessed
real estate _ nearly $13 billion worth _ they literally can't give
it all away.
   Texas got the nation into the S&amp;L mess, and Texas has continued
to make it worse. The thrift industry lost $8.8 billion in the first
nine months of 1988, and $8.3 billion of that was lost in Texas.
   Of the $38.2 billion spent last year by regulators to clean up
the colossal mess, $25.2 billion was spent in Texas.
   Yet after closing or merging 88 insolvent Texas S&amp;Ls last year _
nearly a third of all the S&amp;Ls in the state _ there are still 65 to
70 that regulators haven't gotten to yet.
   ``The ones that have the most notoriety as far as the fraud have
been addressed,'' said George Barclay, president of the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Dallas. ``But it's a moving target...Are there more
(insolvents) coming on stream? Yeah, there probably will be
additional ones, but they'll be smaller.''
   Barclay, one of the architects of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board's ``Southwest Plan,'' says that most of the remaining large
Texas insolvent thrifts will be dealt with by summer, that losses
will begin to end this year, and that regulators are making progress
and have the situation under control.
   That still doesn't mean the thrift crisis is over in Texas,
however. There are other areas of concern:
   _ Despite reports of widespread fraud that contributed billions
of dollars to the S&amp;L crisis, only a handful of S&amp;L officials have
been indicted. The Justice Department has assembled a huge task
force in Dallas, which has been at work more than one year.
   _ The Texas economy, which crashed with the oil-market collapse,
remains sluggish, dashing dreams of a quick turnaround that would
absorb many of the thrift problems. Should the economy dive again
with a new crash in oil prices, the cost of the thrift cleanup would
grow again.
   _ New owners of S&amp;Ls have brought with them $1.1 billion in fresh
capital, something regulators say is an accomplishment. But some
economists say that's just a drop in the bucket, and not enough to
return the state and the industry to solid footing.
   At the heart of the thrift crisis in Texas is the bank board's
often criticized ``Southwest Plan,'' which merges sick institutions
into healthier ones rather than liquidating.
   It was created with a premise that the government just couldn't
dump all the dead real estate in Texas _ that it would have to wait
for the economy to recover and absorb the vacant space.
   Now it's almost a Catch-22 situation: The S&amp;Ls need the economy
to recover, but the economy remains sluggish because of the S&amp;L
related problems, economists say.
   ``The ultimate question is how fast does Texas come back if it
does come back,'' said Salomon Brothers Inc. real estate analyst Bob
Hopkins.
   The Lone Star state's battered economy has begun growing again
slowly, but it's not keeping up with the rest of the nation.
   ``It's going to be awhile before we have growth consistent with
the rest of the U.S.,'' said William Gruben, a senior economist at
the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas.
   Construction has come to a near standstill because of the
oversupply of office buildings and homes. And banks and S&amp;Ls are
hesitant to lend money these days to anyone but the safest of
customers, making it tough for new businesses to get started.
   ``Lenders at virtually every financial institution are running
scared,'' Sheshunoff said. ``The reality on the Texas economy is
that the Texas economy is going to come back one job at a time.''
   And if the economy doesn't cooperate with the regulators, the
cost for the S&amp;L cleanup will undoubtedly rise.
   ``If the economic environment deteriorates further, if the value
of real estate, rather than coming back or stabilizing, goes down,
or if interest rates go up dramatically, that cost will go up,''
Barclay said.
   How the S&amp;L crisis came about is a story of part crime and part
circumstance. It was triggered by the downfall of the Southwest
economy, but it was exaggerated by the high-flying antics of
entrepreneurs, primarily in Texas, who, either through fraud,
mismanagement or bad decisions, created billion-dollar messes.
   At the same time, regulators had only skeletal forces in Texas,
and weren't keeping up.
   So widespread were S&amp;L shenanigans across Dallas that the Justice
Department task force reportedly subpoenaed the records of hundreds
of people.
   The task force, which occupies an entire floor of a federal
building in Dallas, has grown to 58, including 25 FBI agents, said
Richard M. Fishkin, an agent with the fraud section of Justice
Department.
   So far, 33 people have been indicted and 20 convicted. Four
trials are pending. But the major players in what has been described
as looting of thrifts, remain under investigation.
   ``These cases are complex and it takes a long time to accumulate
evidence and put the cases together,'' Fishkin said.
   Meanwhile, regulators have beefed up their examination forces in
Texas, both to prevent a recurrence of the disasters of the mid-80s,
and watch over their Southwest Plan creations.
   In the last five years, the Southwest regional regulatory bank,
which moved from Little Rock, Ark., to Dallas in 1983, has grown
from 92 examiners and supervisors with a $5 million budget to 450
professionals with a $33 million budget.
   This year, another 123 examiners and analysts will be added,
Barclay said, with another $11.5 million for the budget.
   ``We see an awesome responsibility to make sure that the mergers
we're putting together work,'' Barclay said.
   ``Everybody always learns from their experience. What happened
here in '83, '84, and '85 when the regulatory process wasn't up to
snuff, won't happen again,'' Barclay said. ``If anything, we may
even be overreacting.''

<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department will be turning to the
auction block again soon to peddle a barrage of new bonds and notes
that will help support the government's growing national debt.
   This time around, Wall Street's largest brokers will be asked to
buy $28.75 billion in new three- and 10-year notes and 30-year
bonds. They, in turn, will resell the securities to the public.
   Analysts said the auction plan outlined this past week was in
line with market expectations. It's set to begin Tuesday and end
Thursday.
   The only big difference between this auction and the previous two
is that it includes the 30-year bond, which was on hiatus because
Congress had failed to raise the ceiling on issuance of long-term
debt. Congress finally passed new legislation before it adjourned
last year.
   While there were few surprises in the size of the upcoming sale,
economists appeared divided on how well it might go in the wake of
the latest economic data.
   Adding pressure to the credit markets was the government's
January unemployment report, which pointed to continued strength in
the economy along with the possibility of higher inflation.
   The report, released Friday, showed that the nation's jobless
rate inched up to 5.4 percent in January from 5.3 percent at the end
of the year. But despite the slight increase, 408,000 new jobs were
created last month, and that was far more than most economists had
predicted.
   ``We believe the employment data is extremely negative,'' said
William V. Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It increases the pressures for the Fed to
tighten credit.''
   The Federal Reserve has indicated repeatedly that it will push
for higher interest rates to keep inflation in check, thereby making
borrowing more expensive and slowing down economic growth.
   Sullivan and several other analysts predict that interest rates
will be on the rise going into the upcoming auction.
   ``We don't think the current yield level reflects the underlying
fundamentals in the U.S. economy,'' he said.
   The upward slant in rates will put pressure on the Treasury to
make the yields of its new bonds and notes high enough to attract
domestic and foreign money.
   One saving grace, though, is the fact that the dollar has
remained strong in foreign exchange.
   ``The foreign exchange market is definitely a plus for the
Treasury auction,'' said Carol A. Stone, a senior economist for
Nomura Securities International Inc. ``I would say there will be
good foreign participation.''
   A rising dollar is seen as good news for foreigners because it
means they are likely to earn more on their dollar-denominated
investments.
   Proceeds of the upcoming Treasury auction will be used toward
raising about $13.7 billion in cash and redeeming $15.1 billion in
old obligations, which make up part of the $2.8 trillion national
debt.
   The sale will begin on Tuesday with $9.75 billion worth of
three-year notes, followed by $9.5 billion in 10-year securities on
Wednesday and $9.5 billion Thursday.

<HEAD>Tempers Flaring Over Who Bites $85 Billion S&amp;L Bailout Bullet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

   Arguments over who pays the estimated $85
billion-plus tab for cauterizing the wounds of the nation's savings
&amp; loan industry are growing louder and angrier, with auditors
criticizing regulators, depositors rebuking President Bush and his
chief of staff chastising banks.
   By the end of the week the government wasn't any closer to a
solution to what everyone agrees will be the biggest federal bailout
in history at a time the country can least afford it, given a budget
deficit of $150 billion. Bush told congressional lawmakers any
rescue plan ``will not be popular.''
   The underlying acrimony in the crisis afflicting many of the
nation's 3,000 S&amp;Ls seemed to turn uglier with each passing day in
Washington, where much of the feuding took place over how their
rescue should be financed.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
told lawmakers that federal regulators were wrong to rush into a
rash of deals late last year with promises of billions of dollars in
assistance and guarantees to buyers of broke, badly managed savings
&amp; loan institutions.
   The GAO recommended the government seize all remaining insolvent
S&amp;Ls to isolate them from the healthy part of the industry.
   In addition, GAO Comptroller General Charles Bowsher released a
report suggesting several accounting firms inexplicably failed to
report staggering loan problems at troubled Southwestern thrifts,
contributing to what some lawmakers called a massive coverup.
   At least one congressional critic of the government's handling of
the crisis, Rep. Henry Gonzalez, T-Texas, said he had asked the
Justice Department to explore taking unspecified civil action
against the errant accountants.
   At the same time, the first notable Bush gaffe in his 2-week-old
presidency _ suggesting S&amp;L deposits could be taxed to subsidize the
bailout effort _ not only refused to die but snowballed into a
serious political problem that raised new questions about his
judgment.
   Some lawmakers said they were inundated with constituent mail
denouncing the Bush idea. Reports surfaced nationwide that
depositors were withdrawing their money from both sick and healthy
S&amp;Ls to avoid the risk of a tax.
   Bush's chief of staff John Sununu, meanwhile, fired off his own
critical barrage directed at the banking industry over
advertisements run in three states that he said were designed to
raise thrift-depositor doubts about the sanctity of their savings.
He called the ads ``unequivocally irresponsible.''
   The American Bankers Association lobby group rejected Sununu's
outrage over the ads, which ran in Kansas, Texas and Arkansas, where
the S&amp;L crisis has been acutely felt. The ABA countered that it has
always maintained banks are more secure than S&amp;Ls and that history
is bearing the claim out.
   ``It is a very sensitive issue for bankers who have been under
siege for years now by some bankrupt savings and loans who are
trying to compete with below-market rates,'' said Mary-Liz Meany, an
ABA spokeswoman.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The government released reports that showed January unemployment
rose slightly, while in December, factory orders surged, personal
income and spending both climbed at the same rate and a key
forecasting gauge jumped. Analysts remained divided over whether the
data evidenced a slowdown or higher inflation ahead.
   _Market corruption crackdowns spread from Chicago and New York to
other big cities targeted by a special Justice Department task
force. At the same time, Chicago futures-exchange officials
intensified a self-policing effort in the aftermath of an FBI
bugging operation said to expose rampant fraud.
   _More fallout hit Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. as a result of its
agreement to plead guilty to securities fraud charges related to the
Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal, this time from New Jersey
gambling authorities who moved to sever the firm's ties to the
Atlantic City casino business. Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., another big
firm that paid a big fine a few years ago because of the scandal and
has been struggling since, was hit by a spate of resignations.
   _General Motors Corp. announced the indefinite shutdown of a
plant in Framingham, Mass., an indication the giant automaker is
still trying to cut operations despite claims of a turnaround.
Chrysler Corp., meanwhile, announced an agreement to market Hyundai
cars in the United States, becoming the last big U.S. automaker to
develop direct ties to a Korean counterpart.

<HEAD>Stocks Up, Inflation Fears Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A series of recent price increases suggests that
one group of economy-watchers is worrying less, not more, about
inflation.
   The prices in question are those of common stocks, up close to 15
percent on average over the last 2{ months.
   At their lows in mid-November, Wall Street was brimming with talk
that economic growth was straining the capacity of the nation's
factories and labor force.
   The resulting inflationary pressures, it was said, would push
interest rates sharply higher and set the economy on a course toward
recession.
   Since then, however, money managers at investing institutions
seem to have reassessed the inflation outlook, bidding stocks up to
levels not seen since before Black Monday on Oct. 19, 1987.
   A good many observers, including Chairman Alan Greenspan of the
Federal Reserve Board, have warned lately that inflation remains a
threat.
   But as people make their investment decisions these days, they
appear to be operating more and more on the assumption that the Fed
will keep inflation in check without stifling the business expansion.
   That thinking is evident in the behavior of long-term interest
rates in the bond market, which have actually declined a bit even as
the Fed has tightened credit and short-term interest rates have
moved up.
   ``The bullish sentiment in the bond market in January has partly
reflected the viewpoint that short-term rates will not have to rise
much higher and for a prolonged period in order for the Fed to
contain inflation,'' said Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Inc.
   Similarly, David Resler at Nomura Securities International Inc.,
observed, ``Through word and deed, Mr. Greenspan has proven his
commitment to hold inflation in check.
   ``We suspect that the principal reason for these rather euphoric
markets is the growing belief that discipline will govern both
monetary and budgetary policies during the year (and, perhaps,
years) ahead.''
   In the past week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
8.39 to 2,331.25, posting its fifth straight weekly gain since the
start of 1989.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.72 to
166.50; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 8.39 to 406.35, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 3.31 at 324.88.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 186.79 million shares a day,
against 196.40 million the week before.
   Fears that rapid employment growth might soon touch off
inflationary forces in the form of accelerating wage increases have
by no means been dispelled altogether.
   For some analysts, those worries were in fact heightened on
Friday when the Labor Department reported that payroll employment
increased by a larger-than-expected 408,000 jobs in January.
   ``Full employment is imminent. So is sharply higher inflation,''
asserted Charles Lieberman, director of financial markets research
at New York's Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp., in a report
published this past week.
   ``The pool of unemployed is sufficiently depleted that only about
800,000 to 900,000 more workers can be hired without unusual wage
inducements.''
   But Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities,
argues that low unemployment need not be an inflationary force.
   ``We believe that labor shortages will induce business,
particularly in the services sector, to boost productivity,''
Yardeni says.
   ``If so, then low unemployment rates, in effect, will boost our
national productivity, which should reduce inflationary pressures.
   ``During the 1970s, we experienced high unemployment and high
inflation. In the 1990s, we should experience low unemployment and
low inflation.''

   The financial markets showed little movement despite indications
the economy is expanding at a fairly strong rate with employment
levels, factory orders and auto sales all rising.
   On Wall Street, stock prices finished little changed Friday as
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.50 to 2,331.25.
   The dollar closed little changed against most currencies and bond
prices posted some modest losses.
   In Washington, the Bush administration assured American allies of
the president's commitment to lowering the U.S. budget deficit but
the participants said they reached no agreement on a new approach to
the troubling issue of Third World debt.
   The two days of meetings of finance ministers and central bank
presidents from Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and
Canada ended with officials projecting an upbeat view of the world
economy despite the continuing debt problem and the fact that trade
imbalances have begun widening again.
   The Labor Department said non-farm payrolls rose by 408,000 jobs
in January, well above market expectations. The strong job growth
overshadowed the announcement that the unemployment rate rose 0.1
percentage point to 5.4 percent in January.
   Analysts said the economy may be growing too quickly and
predicted the Federal Reserve would move to rein it in.
   ``It's a much stronger report than we thought,'' said Davis Wyss,
chief economist at Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass.,
forecasting firm. ``It suggests we are going into the first quarter
a lot stronger than we thought. The Fed is going to tighten and
short-term interest rates will be going up.''
   Some predicted that action will come next week, when the Federal
Reserve's Open Market Committee meets to set 1989 targets for growth
in the money supply. Tight growth restrictions act as a brake on
economic growth by pushing interest rates upward.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said factory orders
shot up 4.1 percent in December.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable
manufactured goods reached a seasonally adjusted total of $237.6
billion in December after rising 0.5 percent in November and 2.0
percent in October.
   The nation's automakers, meanwhile, reported that sales of
U.S.-made cars and light trucks rose 5.6 percent in late January.
   The automakers reported they sold cars and light trucks at a
daily rate of 41,798 vehicles during the Jan. 21-31 period this
year, compared with a rate of 39,571 during the same period a year
ago.
   Car sales were up 5.3 percent, led by a 14.8 percent increase by
Ford Motor Co., and truck sales rose 6.3 percent during the period.
General Motors Corp.'s U.S.-made car sales rose 2.1 percent while
Chrysler Corp.'s fell 11.9 percent in late January compared with the
same period last year.
