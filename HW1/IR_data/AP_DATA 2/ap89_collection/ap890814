   Unofficial results in Guatemala's first
presidential primary showed Christian Democratic Party chief Alfonso
Cabrera was ahead Monday amid charges of fraud from some party
members.
   Official results have not been released from Sunday's balloting.
   The date for the national presidential election has not been
announced but it is expected to be held late this year. President
Vinicio Cerezo's five-year term expires Jan. 14, 1991.
   Results broadcast by the Emisoras Unidas radio chain of the
primary vote indicated that Cabrera, a congressman and former
foreign minister under Cerezo, was ahead. He led Rene de Leon
Schlotter, a longtime party leader and former development minister,
and Cerezo's wife, Raquel Blandon de Cerezo who is a lawyer.
   Mrs. Cerezo, director of social welfare, has been active in the
party but did not openly campaign for the nomination.
   The president, a Christian Democrat, has backed Cabrera.
   An afternoon newspaper published a full-page advertisement
proclaiming Cabrera the elected candidate.
   But Schlotter claimed the vote was fraudulent. He said no
elections were held in certain towns, some voter registration lists
were altered and others were incomplete.
   Turnout for the primary was estimated at about 120,000.
   In other party primaries, Jorge Carpio Nicolle, founder of the
National Union of the Center, and Jorge Serrano Elias of the Joint
Action Movement were virtually assured of winning.

<HEAD>U.S. Supreme Court Halts Creation of Louisiana Desegregation Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Supreme Court justice Monday
temporarily halted creation of a new governing board to oversee
desegregation of Louisiana's 17 public colleges and universities.
   The ruling by Justice Byron R. White, who acted on emergency
requests from state Attorney General William Guste and the Southern
University Board of Supervisors, came as a state Senate committee
began confirmation hearings on 17 nominees for the governing board.
   John Kennedy, an attorney for Gov. Buddy Roemer, who opposes the
delay, agreed with Guste that the case raises major constitutional
questions on desegregation of colleges and universities.
   But in a brief filed with the high court, Kennedy said attempts
to postpone creation of the new board are politically motivated and
would hinder racial intergration. Keeping the Southern board ``is
merely another form of separatism which cannot be constitutionally
condoned,'' the brief said.
   A three-judge federal panel in New Orleans ordered the
abolishment of the state's four governing boards for higher
education as part of a plan to desegregate Louisiana's higher
education system. Under the panel's ruling, the board is scheduled
to begin operations Friday.
   White's order stops the elimination of the Southern board until
the full Supreme Court receives a response by Justice Department
lawyers. The order did not impose a deadline for the response. Guste
and the Southern board want the desegregation plan stopped until the
full Supreme Court can hear an appeal.
   The case began in 1974 when the Justice Department sued on behalf
of black students, prompting the three-judge court to rule that
``the present scheme ... has perpetuated illegal segregation in
Louisiana's higher education.''
   Last year, the court ruled that a 1981 consent decree had failed
to desegregate colleges and universities. The agreement had called
for the state to spend millions of dollars to upgrade Southern and
Grambling State University, the state's predominantly black
universities.
   Guste and the Southern board contend that the state is not
responsible for any vestiges of segregation that remain in
Louisiana's higher education system and the four-board system _ set
up by the state constitution _ should not be scuttled.
   ``We have had over 20 years without any (legally imposed)
segregation. A whole generation of students has grown up. They are
exercising their constitutional right of freedom of choice of
academic programs and constitutional right of freedom of
association,'' Guste said during a news conference.
   Guste said the proposed single board has been given a strict
timetable to implement a desegregation plan, including creation of a
community college system and specified roles and missions for each
university. Most of the changes are required to be implemented
within 120 days.
   A full appeal to the Supreme Court would take about a year, Guste
said.
   ``Can you imagine what would happen a year from now if the court
went back to the four boards? It would be total confusion,'' he said.

   A hot-air balloon collided with
another 2,000 feet over the Australian outback Sunday, plunging to
the ground and killing all 13 people aboard, officials said.
   An aviation expert called it the worst such accident in the
history of ballooning.
   Police said the balloon crashed during a sightseeing trip over a
desert near the central Australian town of Alice Springs.
   Witnesses said the sensed the tragedy before the collision
occurred.
   ``I could see one of the balloons rising fast under another
one,'' said a West German tourist, Irene Fielder, who was in a
third balloon. ``The lower balloon then came up and hit the other
balloon. Its top was touching the basket and it was shaking the
passengers around. I knew something horrible was going to happen.''
   Ken Watts, who was piloting a balloon four miles from where the
accident occurred, told the Australian Associated Press: ``It just
folded up and plummeted to earth. Myself and my passengers were
sickened.''
   The Civil Aviation Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety banned
all balloon flights over Alice Springs while they investigated the
accident.
   Northern Territory police identified the victims as 11
Australians, an Italian and a Dane.
   News reports said three of the victims apparently jumped out at
the last moment to try to save themselves.
   The 10 others were found huddled together in the woven basket
attached to the canopy filled with Liquid Propane Gas, officials
said. The 13 aboard were believed to include a pilot and 12
tourists.
   A spokesman for another company, Outback Ballooning, said the
balloon that crashed was owned by locally-based Toddy's Ballooning,
but no spokesman from the company was unavailable for comment.
   It took police three hours to remove the bodies, which were
wedged tighty in the bottom of the basket. The balloon fabric fell
in a heap beside the basket, which landed between two small trees
in rugged open scrubland about 10 miles from the Alice Springs
airport.
   Tourists go ballooning from Alice Springs to see nearby Ayers
Rock, a sacred aboriginal site and one of the world's biggest
monoliths.
   In Brisbane, former World Balloon champion Roger Meadmore
described the crash as the worst in the history of the sport.
   ``In the 206-year history of ballooning, no balloon that was
airworthy and properly maintained has ever crashed,'' he said.
``This is the worst balloon fatality in history and it is a
terrible thing for ballooning and a terrible thing for Australian
tourism.''
   It was the second fatal ballooning crash in nine days. On Aug.
5, pilot Robert A. Mock as killed when his balloon deflated at
3,000 feet during a national competition in Baton Rouge, La.
   Armond Edwards, an investigator for the National Transportation
Safety Board, said that Mock's balloon was leaking before take-off.

   Dozens of Dade County pit bull owners wore black
armbands to protest a new licensing ordinance for their dogs, but
grudgingly complied with a requirement they register and insure the
pets.
   The measure, which goes into effect today, requires owners to
keep their dogs securely fenced with a ``dangerous dog'' sign and
to have insurance in case their dogs attack someone.
   A young girl was badly mauled in the worst of several attacks
that led the Metro-Dade Commission to pass the ordinance earlier
this year.
   Some of the owners who registered their dogs and paid $50 fees
at the Dade County Animal Control center Sunday predicted the
commission would suffer a political backlash from angry dog owners.
   ``This commission has woken up a sleeping giant,'' said Bob
Sanchez, president of the 400-member Responsible Dog Owners of Dade
County.

<HEAD>British Liberties: Among The Casualties Of Northern Ireland</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Behind the lives destroyed in 20 years of violence
in Northern Ireland lies another casualty: the corruption of civil
liberties in Britain itself.
   In its attempts to crush the Irish Republican Army, a nation
that ranks among the world's older democracies has adopted laws
which opponents say would look more at home in a dictatorship.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher defends the practice of
detaining suspects for a week without charging them or banning
British radio and television stations from broadcasting interviews
with IRA members as part of the price for fighting terrorism.
   ``To beat off your enemy in a war you have to suspend some of
your civil liberties for a time,'' she said after last October's
imposition of the broadcast ban, which also covers members and
sympathizers of 10 other militant groups.
   ``None of us can be neutral as between the terrorist and the
law-abiding citizen,'' added Mrs. Thatcher, who survived an IRA
hotel bombing in 1984 that killed five people, including two senior
Conservative Party figures.
   Her critics, however, detect a gradual warping of democratic
freedoms since ``the troubles'' flared and Britain dispatched
troops on Aug. 14, 1969 to keep Northern Ireland's Protestants and
Catholics apart. Twenty years later, the troops remain.
   The Financial Times of London, in an editorial in December,
commented on ``a lengthening list of recent government decisions
each of which has given greater weight to reasons of state than to
the civic rights of the individual. Most, but not all, arise from
the troubles in Northern Ireland.''
   However, the most controversial legislation, the Prevention of
Terrorism Act, is a legacy of a Labor government _ enacted in 1978
after 21 civilians were killed by an IRA bomb in an English pub.
   The act, which applies throughout what is known formally as the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, includes
police powers to detain suspects for up to a week without charge.
   In the decade of rule by Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative
government, Northern Ireland's death toll climbed past 2,700 and
Britain has been cited 21 times _ the most by any country _ for
violating the European Convention on Human Rights.
   Her government imposed the broadcast ban on paramilitary groups
and limited, or proposed limiting, the right of a suspect to remain
silent.
   Since last fall, courts in Northern Ireland have been able to
interpret an accused's silence after arrest as an indication, in
some circumstances, of guilt. Those circumstances are:
   _ Failing to mention during interrogation any fact offered in
defense at trial.
   _ Refusing to be sworn or answer questions at trial.
   _ Failing to explain any possessions or marks on the defendant's
clothing or person at the time of arrest.
   _ Failing to give an account for being at a particular place at
the time of arrest.
   The courts themselves, which are convened without juries which
might be intimidated or split along sectarian lines, are also an
extraordinary step taken in 1973 to combat terrorism.
   Last month, a government advisory panel proposed limiting the
right of silence for ordinary criminals in England and Wales.
   Regulations under the anti-terrorist act have been used to
compel photographers and television stations to hand over material
to help police investigations.
   TV networks complained their crews were put in added danger
after being compelled last year to hand over unscreened footage of
an IRA funeral march in which two British soldiers were murdered by
a mob.
   ``We'd been pushed another step down a road with an uncertain
ending,'' commented Roger Bolton, an executive with London's Thames
Television station, after giving police tape of an interview with a
suspected terrorist.
   Britain's run-ins with the European Court of Human Rights are
partly due to the fact that this country has no written bill of
rights or constitution and thus issues are automatically
transferred to the court in Strasbourg, France, instead of being
filtered through domestic courts.
   Last November, Britain refused to implement a ruling by the
19-judge court that the anti-terrorism act's detention powers
violate the European Human Rights Convention and should be repealed.
   The case was brought by four Northern Ireland men who were held
for between 4{ days and a week in 1984 and then released.
   Britain invoked an article of the convention that says the
ruling need not be accepted ``in time of war or public emergency
threatening the life of the nation.''

<HEAD>Panama Canal at 75: Still Working, Still Controversial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CULEBRA CUT, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panama Canal celebrates its 75th
birthday Tuesday still a subject of controversy, a symbol of
destiny to the United States and a reminder to Panama of its
colonial days.
   The first trip through the man-made shortcut between the
Atlantic and the Pacific was made by the steamer Ancon on August
15, 1914, a voyage nearly lost in the rush of history as World War
I began in Europe.
   ``We made Panama the gateway to the world,'' said Arnold Small,
99, who came from Barbados in 1911 to work on the canal and is one
of the few surviving workers.
   The waterway made Panama an international trading center but it
also tied Panama to the United States, which guaranteed the young
country's independence from Colombia in 1903 in return for a chunk
of territory to build the canal.
   Ten years of work followed as a labor force that reached 36,000
built dams and locks, conquered yellow fever and malaria and sawed
through Gold Hill, now the peak of Culebra Cut, also known as the
Gailliard Cut for its chief engineer.
   The Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty of 1903 created a little America in
the 10-mile wide Canal Zone, with its own courts, police, stamps,
stores and lifestyle.
   It was also a land of high salaries for Americans and low wages
for Panamanians, a land where the racial segregation of the
American South was imposed.
   That history is still being used by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
and the Panamanian government to whip up anti-U.S. sentiment.
   In 1977, President Jimmy Carter and the late Panamanian dictator
Omar Torrijos signed the treaties that eliminated the Canal Zone
and called for the United States to give up all rights to the canal
it built and maintained at noon on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Noriega claims the United States plans to renege on its
commitment to turn the canal over to Panama and close down its
military bases. As commander of the Defense Forces, Noriega is de
facto ruler of Panama although he has been indicted in the United
States on drug charges.
   ``The canal has been good and bad for us,'' said Panamanian
historian Carlos Bolivar Pedreschi in an interview. ``It helped us
attain independence and created an efficient class of
administrators. But then the United States also created and
supported a Panamanian military class that, claiming it must
prepare to protect the canal, has suppressed the democratic
forces.''
   After 75 years the canal is working as well as ever. In 1988
more than 12,300 ships _ about 211 million tons _ passed through,
paying out more than $340 million in tolls.
   And traffic is increasing in both number and volume as more and
more ships are built to the maximum the canal can take _ the locks
are 1,000 feet long, 110 feet wide.
   Ships are lifted 85 feet from one ocean and deposited again in
the other through the locks, whose level rises or descends
depending on the ship's direction.
   In between, the ships sail through nine narrow miles at Culebra
Cut and cross Gatun Lake, 138 square miles of fresh water formed by
a dam across the Chagres River.
   While the importance of the canal to the United States has been
reduced by air and highways over the ``land bridge'' between East
and West Coasts and by the increased size of the U.S. Navy, 14
percent of U.S. maritime trade still moves through the locks.
   The canal is increasingly being used by Japanese, Korean and
other Far Eastern nations to export to the United States, Europe
and Latin America. Asia-East Coast trade accounts for 45 percent of
canal traffic by itself.
   And while the volume is lower, the canal is vital to economic
development in Latin American nations; the canal route from Peru to
the East Coast is 6,200 miles shorter than sailing around Cape Horn
at the tip of South America.
   ``Far into the 21st century, the canal will continue to be an
important route for many countries,'' said Deputy Administrator
Fernando Manfredo, the highest-ranking Panamanian on the Panama
Canal Commission.
   In the past two years the United States used its control to put
pressure on the Panamanian government to oust Noriega. The
short-term outlook is for more confrontation.
   U.S. forces, charged with defense of the canal, often carry out
maneuvers on Panamanian soil as a show of force. The short-term
outlook is for more confrontation.
   The U.S. government, which operates the waterway through the
Panama Canal Commission, has withheld more than $100 million in
canal tolls from the government of Panama.
   The Canal Commission's adminstrator is a U.S. citizen and the
deputy adminstrator a Panamanian, roles that are to reverse Jan. 1,
according to the Carter-Torrijos treaties.
   But the United States is not likely to approve a Panamanian
linked to Noriega and Noriega is unlikely to nominate Manfredo, who
might gain approval.
   ``You will have a deputy U.S. administrator running the canal,''
Manfredo said.
   Nevertheless, the canal will remain for a long time Panama's
main natural resource, according to Pedreschi.
   U.S. agencies involved in the operation of the canal paid more
than $224 million in wages and salaries to employees in 1988. In
addition, more than $200 milion went into the Panamanian economy as
payment for services, for direct purchases and for construction.
   Manfredo said that for the next 20 years canal traffic should
register a sustained growth of 2 percent annually, ``if the canal
is run efficiently and there are no exaggerated canal toll
increases, and if there are no political problems.''
   Manfredo says the Panamanians have the capacity to run and
improve the canal, pointing to ongoing work to control mudslides at
Gold Hill.
   The canal still arouses intense emotion among some in the United
States who believe that it should never be given up, but most U.S.
canal workers are reconciled to the fact.
   The work force of about 7,500 is 85 percent Panamanian. One
vital engineering area, the locks division, is 100 percent
Panamanian. Slowest to change have been the pilots, where 58 of 238
are Panamanian.

   When Solidarity agreed last spring to take
only 35 percent of Parliament seats, union strategists saw it as
the first step in a smooth four-year transition from a one-party
state to full democracy.
   But they did not reckon with the explosion in public
expectations that followed Solidarity's election victory in June,
or the sudden deterioration in the economy.
   Poles don't want to wait for change, and that's the reason
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa gave when he made an about-face last
week and urged formation of a Solidarity-led coalition government.
   According to Senator Jaroslaw Kaczynski, acting as Walesa's
personal envoy in the coalition talks, Walesa himself might become
prime minister.
   It is a far cry from the plan articulated by Solidarity
strategists after last spring's agreement that set the stage for
the opposition's entrance into parliamentary politics.
   As originally conceived, Solidarity would use this parliamentary
term to monitor communist authorities from the opposition bench
while getting familiar with the nuts and bolts of government and
creating independent political parties to win elections in 1993.
   In the meantime, the Communist Party and Poland's East bloc
allies _ especially the Soviet Union _ would have time to
accommodate themselves to the notion of a non-Communist Poland.
   Two months after the elections, that timetable already is
looking outdated.
   Desperately counting on changes for the better, Poles standing
in line for such basics as bread and meat are in no mood to talk
about waiting until 1993 for a change in government.
   Industrial production is falling, food prices went up sharply
Aug. 1, store shelves are often empty and there are signs Poland is
slipping into hyper-inflation.
   When the Communist Party named three familiar faces to the
country's three top jobs _ Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski as president,
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski as party chief, and Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak as
prime minister _ the public's patience seemed to snap.
   Walesa's quest for the government is a reaction to the resulting
``social impatience,'' said Senator Aleksander Paszynski.
   ``We asked ourselves, can we wait? The answer ... is no,'' said
Solidarity's parliamentary leader, Bronislaw Geremek.
   As early as June 2, Jaruzelski had proposed a ``grand
coalition'' government whose distribution of ministries would
reflect more or less the proportion of voting strength in
Parliament _ that is, two-thirds of the Cabinet for the Communist
coalition and one-third for Solidarity.
   Then, Walesa replied in essence, ``No thanks. We'll stay in
opposition.''
   He did not want Solidarity's name tarnished in the kind of phony
coalition rule that took place in Poland after World War II. Then,
figurehead ministers of various political stripes served to
camouflage the Communist consolidation of power beneath the surface.
   As a counterproposal, just before Kiszczak's election, Walesa
offered to take on the whole government, including the defense and
police ministries.
   Jaruzelski, as Walesa could have expected, rejected that.
According to opposition lawmakers, Jaruzelski made clear that the
Soviet Union would not support a Solidarity government.
   But after Kiszczak's election as prime minister Aug. 2, as the
protests rose from grassroots Solidarity chapters, Walesa went on
the offensive.
   He called for a non-Communist coalition government that would
include Solidarity and the previously Communist-allied minor
parties, the Peasants and the Democrats.
   Geremek broadened the offer, proposing places in the government
to reformist Communists.
   Walesa's move has touched off a flurry of meetings and
consultations. With the Peasants and Democrats expressing interest,
there have been rumblings of worry from Moscow.
   The Soviet ambassador even went to talk to the leaders of the
two minor parties.
   Where it will end is anyone's guess. All that can be said is
that the options for the next government have been significantly
widened.
   By merely putting up a fight for the government, Walesa has
scored at least three political successes.
   He has put the Communists on the defensive, forcing them to
justify to public opinion why they should lead the government.
   He has widened the rifts within the Communist coalition,
provoking the normally reliable Democrats and Peasants to show
unprecedented independence.
   And he has protected Solidarity from charges that it was
unwilling to take responsibility for leading the country.
   Now the stage is set for hard political bargaining.
   Jaruzelski's original idea of a ``grand coalition'' government
that would include some combination of Communists and Solidarity
ministers may still become a reality, but under terms negotiated to
Walesa's satisfaction.

   Ask anyone in Shirley Harrison's coal-mining
family what the United Mine Workers' strike is about, and the
answer will have nothing to do with money.
   They all believe that Pittston Coal Group has drafted a contract
designed to break the union.
   ``And we're going to fight like hell to see that they don't,''
Mrs. Harrison said.
   At a recent UMW rally at the Russell County courthouse in this
town in far western Virginia, Mrs. Harrison and her two daughters
were singing union songs while her husband, a disabled miner, stood
by. One brother was arrested for participating in a sit-down
demonstration on the front steps and another brother, a strike
captain, was videotaping the entire scene.
   The perception that Pittston is out to bust the union, which the
company disputes, is the main reason behind a bargaining deadlock.
Neither side expected an end to the stalemate as negotiators
prepared for their 139th bargaining session Tuesday. Talks began in
November 1987. The strike is in its fifth month.
   The issue of survival for Pittston's 1,695 union employees
caused wildcat sympathy strikes by about 46,000 UMW members at
other coal companies in 10 states last month. The wildcat strikers
returned to work the week of July 17.
   ``It's something we fight for from the heart because it's in the
heart. Coal mining is our way of life here,'' said Mrs. Harrison,
50, whose father, grandfather and great-grandfather mined the rich
coal veins of southwestern Virginia.
   In a normal summer, Mrs. Harrison said, she would be organizing
family picnics and barbecues at their Castlewood home. Now the
relatives gather at rallies, demonstrations and court hearings.
   ``We're closer than we've ever been,'' she said. ``Pittston is
actually making families and the union stronger.''
   The issues have not fundamentally changed since Pittston broke
away from the group of coal companies that negotiated a national
contract with the UMW last year.
   Union officials have portrayed Pittston's proposals as an
assault on the families whose forefathers were digging coal for the
company and its predecessors even before the UMW began organizing
the coalfields in the 1920s.
   Pittston President Michael Odom said the main issue for the
company, which exports 65 percent of its coal, is operational
flexibility. The company needs to cut labor costs if it hopes to
continue competing in the global market, he said.
   The company wants to operate its mines on a 7-day-a-week,
24-hour-a-day schedule, ease work rules, cut health care and
pension costs and contract out more labor.
   Odom said the company is offering higher wages and an
independent pension plan that is better than the industry-wide plan.
   UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran said that since 1984, Pittston has
been transferring coal reserves to new non-union coal mining
subsidiaries while laying off union employees. Corcoran contended
that Pittston is trying to gradually become a non-union operation.
   Odom denies that, pointing to a company promise to try to
maintain employment at the pre-strike level of 1,695.
   The company, however, is offering a contract without a
successorship clause. Such a clause requires that if any of
Pittston's 12 union coal companies is sold, the new owner must
honor the union contract and keep the union workforce.

   A coven of witches in Rhode Island _ the
state founded as a haven for religious dissenters _ hope they, too,
will gain public acceptance now that the state has declared them a
legitimate religious group.
   Members of the Rosegate Coven want outsiders to see them as
followers of a faith, not freaks who ride brooms and cast spells.
   In a recent interview in a kitchen adorned with skulls, pictures
of sorcerers, the obligatory broom and a humorous kitchen-witch,
coven members talked about their attempts to sensitize others to
their beliefs.
   ``We have to combat centuries of conditioning. People have been
conditioned by their religion ... and society to ridicule us, not
to take anything seriously that the Christian religion doesn't put
forth,'' said the coven's high priestess, Joyce Siegrist, also
known as Lady Genevieve.
   ``People don't easily give up their misconceptions _ they really
enjoy them,'' said Siegrist, 46, also the director of the New
England chapter of the Witches' Anti-Defamation League.
   At a meeting last October, the group, which has about 40
members, decided to incorporate as a non-profit religious group and
apply for an exemption from Rhode Island sales tax. Last week, the
state tax administrator overruled an earlier decision and approved
the request.
   The certificate granting the exemption is framed and hangs in
the modest kitchen, near an enlarged photograph showing the
Rosegate ``grove,'' or overall group of about 40 initiates. The
coven, or inner core of leaders, consists of about a dozen people.
   ``Obviously the intent wasn't to save the 6 percent sales tax,''
said Julian Bradford, who handles Rosegate's public relations. ``It
was to obtain the legitimization.''
   The coven, also known as Our Lady of the Roses Wiccan Church,
decided to come out of the closet in part because of the recent
publicity about Satanists.
   ``We've been lumped with them for 800 years. It makes us stand
up and say `enough is enough,''' said Bradford.
   It doesn't make sense to the witches that people confuse them
with Satanists. To believe in Satan you have to believe in the
Judeo-Christian tradition, Bradford said.
   The Wiccans believe in a diety with male and female attributes,
whose psychic energy can be tapped by anyone. Rosegate, a Wiccan
sect, emphasizes metaphsyics rather than simple magic, and does not
use many of the props often associated with witchcraft.
   ``In our tradition we are trying to erradicate needless
superstition,'' said Siegrist, citing as an example the use of
crystal balls. ``The ball doesn't have diddly. The power comes from
within.''
   From Siegrist's kitchen office, equipped with a copying machine,
the coven puts out a newsletter eight times a year, keeps track of
its 75-subscriber mailing list, arranges witchcraft classes and
plans meetings.
   The group has a small building fund and hopes someday to open a
center, complete with sanctuary and classrooms.
   Rosegate suffers little harassment overall, said Siegrist. A
crank caller who repeatedly called during the interview was
``really the first crank I've ever had to put up with,'' she said.
   But ``the mockery is always going to exist,'' said Bradford.
``We're the victims of eight or nine centuries of bad press.''
   When hostility surfaces, ``we try our best not to return it,''
Siegrist said.
   The witches profess to be uninhibited about their beliefs but
appear to be held back by their traditional upbringings.
   Sanura, 49, the secretary and musician of the group, said she
has told only one family member she is a witch. ``Those Irish
Catholics would disown me for sure.'' She declined to give her
non-witch name.
   Bradford, who fought in Vietnam and has ``mother'' tatooed on
his forearm, said, ``We're very open about what we are because we
have nothing to hide. We welcome the opportunity to educate
others.''
   He said others are accepting when they learn he is a witch.
   ``One guy made broom jokes at work until he had a problem I
worked out with a little magic,'' he said. Bradford, who works at
an East Providence car dealership, would not elaborate on the
problem or his solution other than to say there was ``no hocus
pocus, simply the application of proven metaphysical principles.''
   Now that the coven has proven it's legitimate, at least in the
eyes of Rhode Island's division of taxation, what does it want now?
   ``Give us a corporate broom to fly us to the Bahamas,'' joked
Bradford.

   Even in the dog-eat-dog corporate world, you
can't serve sloppy spaghetti at your dinner parties, business
students at Stetson University are told.
   At the University of Miami, aspiring moguls learn to put the
butter plate on the left _ and never forget to RSVP.
   While American business still runs on bare-knuckle competition,
a few institutions are recognizing that students need to learn some
manners before entering the fray.
   It's Amy Vanderbilt meets Donald Trump as courses in the social
graces and communication skills begin to appear at some business
schools.
   ``We were totally unprepared for the response,'' said Stetson
University professor Stephen Barnett, who incorporated several
etiquette lectures into his sales management class at DeLand
college last semester. ``The students had so many questions and
took such an interest in the topic, we've decided to expand.''
   This fall, Barnett is planning a weekly evening course in
etiquette that also would address such related subjects as proper
attire and cross-cultural business relationships. He plans to
stress social skills during the annual three-week overseas trip for
his students at the private university near Orlando.
   ``The key to the whole thing is making the students prepared for
all the different people and situations they'll face when they
leave school,'' said Barnett. ``Here, it's comfortable and they get
along well. But they may not be equipped to, say, entertain
properly or set a table. Some of this stuff is so basic it's scary
in a way.''
   Margaret Lee, wife of Stetson President H. Douglas Lee, has
become the unofficial mentor in Barnett's class by giving several
lectures and drawing on her experience as a seasoned hostess.
   For the course, Mrs. Lee offered tips on ``power entertaining''
and being a gracious guest.
   For example, she advises those holding a dinner party to
scrupulously plan and avoid leaving the table once the meal is
served. For guests, bringing a small gift or flowers is a nice
touch, even at business-related dinner parties.
   ``The things that one does for a regular party shouldn't change
because it's with business colleagues,'' said Mrs. Lee. ``Manners
are manners.''
   Many college-age students stumble socially and are perplexed by
protocol because of the way they were raised, said Karen Aronoff,
who began lecturing on business etiquette last year at the
University of Miami School of Business Administration.
   ``These are kids whose parents _ for the most part _ were part
of the '60s counter-culture. Their mottos were `do your own thing'
and `forget tradition,''' she said. ``It's not surprising their
children are not familiar with the traditional social routines.''
   Nelda Crowell, a spokeswoman at the American Graduate School of
International Business in Glendale, Ariz., predicts more campuses
will begin etiquette courses in anticipation of European Economic
Community trade reforms in 1992.
   ``We're going to have to teach American business people how to
work over there and not look like a fool,'' she said.
   Letitia Baldrige, whose 1978 ``Guide to Executive Manners''
still sells briskly, blames the dynamics of contemporary life for
creating frenzied workers who are uneasy in informal settings
outside the office.
   ``How many families get together for a meal and just to talk
these days?'' said Ms. Baldrige, chief of staff for the first lady
during the Kennedy administration. ``People now are caught up in
this fast-food, fast-paced mania, then go home and sit in front of
the television. No wonder people don't even know how to hold a fork
and knife.''

<HEAD>Research Center Creates Retirement Program for Chimps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retirement program for chimpanzees used in
hepatitis and AIDS research will house them in $63,000
air-conditioned bungalows, repayment for the apes' service to
humanity, a researchers says.
   ``We don't think of any of the animals as just tools of
research,'' said Dr. Jorg Eichberg, director of veterinary
resources at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research.
``They've done so much for mankind, this is one way we can pay them
back.''
   A $2.9 million ``pension'' fund is being established at a San
Antonio bank with some of the chimps' ``earnings'' _ the research
grants and fees private and government research institutions pay to
use the animals, The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday.
   A separate fund will pay for 12 air-conditioned retirement huts,
at a cost of $63,000 each, to house chimp retirees.
   Plans also are under way to build a playground for the chimps
similar to the $270,000 breeding colony now in use _ a large, airy
complex complete with swings, tires and grass.
   Huts inhabited by the animals during research have 19-inch color
televisions, but the retirees will have to do without, Eichberg
said.
   ``The retired chimps can visit with each other,'' he said.
``They don't get bored enough to watch TV.''
   The Journal of Medical Primatology has touted the plan as a
model for other research centers, the newspaper reported.
   The 192 chimps at the Southwest Foundation comprise one of the
world's largest captive colonies.
   Currently, 45 are used in research for vaccines against
hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS. The rest are used in other private and government
medical research or for breeding.
   In 1983, Eichberg became the first scientist in the world to
infect a chimpanzee with HIV. That chimp, 15-year-old Paul, is now
in retirement at the foundation.
   Since the chimps can't be used for other research _ and since
chimps can live to age 50 _ Southwest Foundation researchers felt
the need to find some way to take care of them. Officials said they
expect the retirement colony eventually to include 80 chimps.
   The foundation spends about $1 million a year, or $17 a day per
chimp, to feed and maintain its animals, according to foundation
president Duncan Wimpress.

   Echoes of the Woodstock festival reverberate in
American society 20 years after the counterculture concert rocked
the nation. But when it comes to rock 'n' roll itself, most people
say the tune's gone flat.
   Eight in 10 American adults have heard of the Woodstock
festival, held Aug. 15-17, 1969, on a muddy farm in upstate New
York _ and three in 10 of them wish they had attended, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   That high level of awareness was rooted in a view of Woodstock
as more of a historical milestone than simply a show. Most regard
it as the expression of a social movement, and half of them said
that movement continues today.
   Yet the view of Woodstock was not an idealized one. While nearly
six in 10 of those who knew of the festival said it has had a
lasting effect on American society, only half of them said the
effect was a positive one.
   Even more striking was the widely held opinion that times have
changed for the better. Just a quarter said the Woodstock era was a
better time than today, while half viewed it a worse time than now.
   But respondents were critical of the course of rock 'n' roll
music, the raucous hallmark of the Woodstock era: Rock music of the
Woodstock days was rated twice as highly as the rock 'n' roll of
today. Nearly half of all respondents said they still listen to
Woodstock-era rock.
   The poll, conducted among a random sample of 1,163 adults
nationwide, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
   As could be expected, it found a dramatic generational division
in views of Woodstock. For example, 40 percent of those younger
than 45 would have liked to have attended, compared with just 10
percent of the older respondents.
   Moreover, among those who saw a lasting social impact of
Woodstock, more than 60 percent of the younger group said it was a
positive effect, while only about a quarter of the older group
agreed.
   Interest in rock music followed similar lines. More than 60
percent of those under 45 said they listen to Woodstock-era rock
'n' roll now, evidence of the sizable audience for ``classic rock''
radio programming. Of those 45 and older, just 22 percent were
tuned in to Woodstock rock.
   Overall, 50 percent rated rock music of the late 1960s and early
1970s as excellent or good, while just 27 percent gave those
favorable ratings to the rock 'n' roll of today. Among respondents
under 45, seven in 10 gave high ratings to Woodstock rock, while
only four in 10 approved of newer rock.
   The Woodstock festival, featuring most of the top rock bands of
the day, drew half a million people to Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel,
N.Y. The term ``Woodstock Nation'' soon came to refer to young
people who were agitating for an end to the Vietnam War and the
loosening of social mores.
   Twenty percent of the poll's respondents said they knew someone
who attended Woodstock, and 25 of the 1,163 people polled said they
were there.
   The survey was conducted July 7-16. Media General Inc., a
communications company based in Richmond, Va., publishes the
Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa (Fla.)
Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and operates TV
stations WXFL in Tampa, WCBD in Charleston, S.C., and WJKS in
Jacksonville, Fla.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews July 7-16 with 1,163 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that 19
of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Have you heard of the Woodstock music festival that was held
in upstate New York in August 1969, or not? Yes: 81 percent. No: 17
percent. Don't know or no answer: 2 percent.
   2. (If yes) Do you happen to know anyone who attended the
Woodstock music festival, or not? Yes: 20. No: 79. DK-NA: 1.
   3. Did you personally attend the Woodstock music festival? Yes:
2. No: 98.
   4. Would you have liked to have been there? Yes: 29. No: 68.
DK-NA: 4.
   5. Do you think of Woodstock more as a music festival or as an
expression of a social movement? Music: 18. Movement: 70. DK-NA: 11.
   6. (If movement) Do you think that social movement continues
today? Yes: 53. No: 43. DK-NA: 4.
   7. Do you think Woodstock has had a lasting effect on American
society, or not? Yes: 56. No: 34. DK-NA: 10.
   8. (If yes) Would you say that's been a positive effect or a
negative effect? Positive: 50. Negative: 37. DK-NA: 14.
   9. In your view, was the Woodstock era a better time or a worse
time than today? Better: 24. Worse: 50. No difference: 11. DK-NA:
15.
   10. Overall, thinking of the rock 'n' roll music that was played
at the time of Woodstock _ that is, the late 1960s and early 1970s
_ how would you rate that music _ excellent, good, only fair or
poor? Excellent: 17. Good: 33. Fair: 22. Poor: 21. DK-NA: 7.
   11. Overall, how would you rate the rock 'n' roll music you hear
nowadays _ excellent, good, only fair or poor? Excellent: 5. good:
22. Fair: 27. Poor: 41. DK-NA: 6.
   12. Do you listen to rock 'n' roll music from the Woodstock
period now? Yes: 46. No: 51. DK-NA: 3.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Reagan Was More Than an `Acting President'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest book about former President Reagan
begins with a quotation from him: ``There ARE simple answers.'' It
only tells half the story, and that's the trouble with the book.
   The full quotation, which the authors of ``The Acting
President'' provide later in their first chapter is, ``There ARE
simple answers, but there are not always easy ones.''
   That gives a more complete picture of Reagan's point than the
partial quote selected by authors Bob Schieffer and Gary Paul Gates
as an epigraph for their volume, newly published by E.P. Dutton.
   Reagan has already been the subject of many books, and more are
in the works.
   Lou Cannon, who covered the Reagan White House for The
Washington Post and wrote about the former president previously
when he was governor of California, has already written two Reagan
books. His third, about the Reagan presidency, is to be published
late in 1990 or early in 1991.
   Reagan himself is at work on two books. A volume of speeches,
with introductions containing his own reflections on his career, is
due out in November. An autobiographical work will follow. Former
first lady Nancy Reagan will tell her version in a book due out
soon.
   Edmund Morris, Pulitzer Prize winning biographer of Theodore
Roosevelt, was selected by Reagan to write his authorized
biography. And former Attorney General Edwin Meese, a Reagan
associate since Sacramento days, is writing a memoir focusing on
``the Reagan era in modern political history.''
   Schieffer, chief Washington correspondent for CBS news who
covered the White House in the Ford administration, and his CBS
colleague Gates draw heavily on previous books and say they also
conducted scores of interviews.
   Their theme is that Reagan, the first president to have come
from the ranks of professional actors, was essentially a figurehead
manipulated by more knowledgeable aides.
   There is some truth to this. As a boy in Illinois, Reagan did
not set his sights on a political career; his first love was
acting. The skills he honed in Hollywood served him well in
Washington. He was not the first politician to be a public
performer, but he was better at it than most. Like other
presidents, he was often dependent on staff work, and aides jostled
each other for influence over him.
   It is no news that he often left details to others. Former White
House chief of staff and Treasury secretary Donald Regan, for
instance, has said that in four years at Treasury he never had a
discussion of economic policy with Reagan and that the president
rarely ``made a decision or issued orders'' in a meeting while he
was chief of staff.
   However, as the authors of the present book say, it was Reagan,
not former White House chief of staff James A. Baker III or some
other aide, who ``observed with more than routine interest'' the
troubles Jimmy Carter had with his foreign policy apparatus. And it
was Reagan, not his advisers, who lost patience with Alexander Haig
and accepted his resignation as secretary of state.
   The book's thesis also falls a bit flat when Schieffer and
Gates, describing how Baker and other key aides put together an
agenda for Reagan's first term, write that they had ``correctly
read the mood and the mind of the man they served.''
   In other words, Baker and others may have fleshed the ideas out,
but they were Reagan's ideas. It was the Reagan administration. If
Baker had been president, or if former Secretary of State George
Shultz or somebody else had been president, it would have been a
different administration.
   However much or little Reagan knew of the details of the
Iran-Contra affair, the driving force behind it was his
preoccupation with the fate of American hostages and his zeal to
aid the Nicaraguan rebels. As the writers correctly report, Shultz
and former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger tried to talk him
out of it.
   It might be possible to get through eight years as president by
just reading your lines, but ``The Acting President'' fails to
prove that it happened.

   The average price of gasoline fell nearly
three cents a gallon at the pump in the past three weeks, a
nationwide survey found.
   The national average was 112.95 cents a gallon on Friday, 2.71
cents below the average on July 21, according to the Lundberg
Survey. The average includes all grades, self- and full-service,
and all taxes.
   ``A drop of this magnitude during such a short period is
something that motorists have not seen since 1986,'' analyst Trilby
Lundberg said Sunday.
   The survey of 13,000 gasoline stations found that prices per
gallon at self-serve pumps were: regular unleaded 102.29 cents;
premium unleaded 118.32 cents; and regular leaded 102.64 cents.
   Prices per gallon at full-service pumps were: regular unleaded
129.55 cents; premium unleaded 141.74 cents; and regular leaded
129.25 cents.
   Ms. Lundberg said refiners and importers overcompensated to
forestall any shortage because of tight refining capacity, and new
vapor regulations on gasoline.
   As a result, she said, ``There is an abundance of supply and a
cleaner product.''

<HEAD>Lack of Data on Hostages: Legacy of CIA Disasters, Kidnappers' Secretiveness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its heyday in Beirut, the CIA counted among
its assets an exotic array of Lebanese politicians and generals,
dozens of agents from other Moslem countries and a handful of
highly placed Palestinian guerrillas.
   The CIA was even able to use the Palestinians to foil
kidnappings and killing of Americans.
   But over the past 10 years, U.S. intelligence capabilities in
Lebanon have eroded to the extent that the Central Intelligence
Agency cannot pinpoint the location of the eight American hostages
that remain after the reported killing of Marine Lt. Col. William
Higgins.
   The dearth of intelligence about the hostages and their
Iranian-allied captors is partly the legacy of a string of
disasters that has hounded CIA operations in Lebanon, and also the
result of the clannish nature and zealousness of the Shiite Moslem
kidnappers, officials and experts say.
   ``We don't have adequate information on where they live,
operate, train,'' said Robert McFarlane, the former national
security adviser who helped plan the White House scheme to free the
hostages by selling weapons to Iran in 1985-86.
   Under ideal conditions, he said in an interview, the CIA would
recruit native Lebanese or Americans of Lebanese origin to
infiltrate the hostage-takers and report on their activities.
   But Hezbollah, the umbrella group under whose auspices the
captors operate, defies penetration, said Sen. David Boren,
D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
   ``These little cells, these units, are like organized crime
families,'' Boren said in an interview. ``Strangers are easily
spotted, even if they're Lebanese,'' he added.
   Marius Deeb, a Lebanese who taught political science at the
American University of Beirut for many years, thinks many Lebanese
would be willing to give information to the United States about the
kidnappers.
   ``But they're terrorized. They're scared. They have to know for
sure that if they give information, their life will be protected,''
Deeb said.
   Such protection is impossible to guarantee in the chaos of a
country splintered by 14 years of civil war and foreign occupation.
And the history of CIA operations in Lebanon has not been
reassuring.
   Soon after the agency's Beirut station chief, William Buckley,
was kidnapped outside his home in 1984, some of the CIA's Lebanese
agents were murdered or disappeared, according to David Martin and
John Walcott, coauthors of ``Best Laid Plans.'' The book traces the
administration's attempts to fight terrorism in the Middle East.
   U.S. officials believe Buckley revealed many secrets under
torture, possibly in Iran, before being killed. His body has not
been recovered.
   On April 18, 1983, a car bomb explosion demolished much of U.S.
Embassy in Beirut, just as the CIA's chief Middle East analyst,
Robert Ames, convened a staff meeting in his office.
   Ames was one of 16 Americans killed, along with station chief
Kenneth Haas. Martins and Walcott say the blast wiped out all but
two of the agency's staff in Beirut.
   David Ignatius, a Washington Post editor who has written a
fictionalized account of the secret U.S. channel to the PLO, cites
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and the forced exile of Yasser
Arafat from Beirut as the turning point of the CIA's fortunes.
   ``As Lebanon became more anarchic and new groups emerged with
which we had no contact, the old board was broken and we never
really learned to play on the new one,'' Ignatius said.
   The CIA was dealt another blow last December when Matthew K.
Gannon, an agency official who had been on temporary duty in
Beirut, was killed on his way back in the explosion of Pan Am
flight 103 over Scotland, believed to have been caused by a
terrorist's bomb.
   McFarlane and others familiar with intelligence operations
suggest the CIA's ability to operate in Lebanon was hampered by a
decision 12 years ago by former agency chief Stansfield Turner to
concentrate more on technical intelligence gathering, through
satellites and electronic interceptions.
   The late CIA director William Casey ``faced great resistance
within the agency and the intelligence community when he tried to
expand human collection'' of intelligence, McFarlane said.
   Casey then turned outside the agency _ to former White House
aide Oliver North _ in an effort to find out what had happened to
the American hostages in Lebanon and how they could be freed.
North's dealings with Iran, including sales of U.S.-made missiles,
brought about the release of two hostages in 1986.

<HEAD>Residents in Gang-Plagued Los Angeles Vow to Take Back the Community</HEAD>

   The tall trees and large lawns can hardly
camouflage the fact that the Avalon Garden Housing Project lies at
the crack-addled nerve center of the city's gang wars.
   In the playground, above a mural of five of Snow White's seven
dwarfs, someone has scrawled ``Avalon Garden Crips,'' marking the
collection of small stucco apartment buildings as turf claimed by a
deadly street gang.
   ``Los Angeles is like a chameleon,'' observed Ralph Sutton of
Brotherhood Crusade, a social service group. ``There are places
that seem so serene and peaceful, and just the night before there
was bloodletting.''
   Crime-plagued blocks alternate and sometimes merge with the
safer blocks around the housing project, which lies in the heart of
the city's violent south-central region. It is not uncommon to find
a bullet-scarred crack house next to a well-kept cottage with
neatly trimmed bushes and a white wrought-iron fence.
   As a kind of war rages for control of the streets, many
residents in the mostly working-class black and Hispanic
nieghborhood have retreated behind barred windows and doors.
   But lately, a coalition of community leaders, social workers,
business people, church members and civil rights activists have
launched a project called ``Taking Our Community Back.''
   Coordinated by Brotherhood Crusade, the program has recruited
hundreds of volunteers to walk day and night through a 110-block
section of some of the city's worst streets, knocking on doors,
handing out literature, painting over graffiti, clearing alleys and
confronting drug dealers and gang members.
   ``We're not going to allow our community to be held hostage,''
says Danny Bakewell, president and founder of Brotherhood Crusade.
   The goal is to take control of the region for the next 30 to 45
days and give residents the motivation and courage to carry on.
   The patrols, until now scattered around the neighborhood, began
in force over the weekend. Hundreds of men, some responding to a
full-page advertisement in a local newspaper, have volunteered to
walk the streets.
   ``We're trying to create a different buzzing going on in the
streets, a different kind of interaction,'' Bakewell said. ``When
we leave, that community needs to be strong enough to sustain this
on an ongoing basis.''
   Police and city officials are cooperating with the organizers
and call the effort one of the city's most innovative. Residents
also are optimistic.
   But Los Angeles County averages more than one gang killing a
day, and some people suggest the program, while long on good
intentions, may be short on staying power.
   Police say a concerted effort is needed to make a dent in crime
in the neighborhood, where 52 assaults, 89 burglaries, 37 robberies
and 32 auto thefts were reported over last six months. Police did
not have murder statistics for the area.
   ``They're certainly on the right track, but they've got to
ignite people in the community to carry it on,'' said Deputy Chief
Bernard Parks, head of the department's anti-gang operations.
``Sustaining it and being able to endure are key.''
   Bakewell acknowledged that the task appears as daunting as the
area's alleys at night, but refused to accept negative talk.
   ``How successful this ultimately will be, I don't know,'' he
said. ``But what I do know is I'm not prepared to sit around and
declare my community dead, the future of the community null and
void. That's just no way to live.''
   Unlike New York City, where anti-drug crusader Maria Hernandez
was shot dead last week, apparently by drug dealers, authorities
have reported no lethal reprisals against community activists, and
the program already has enjoyed some success.
   On Aug. 5, more than 350 people attended a kickoff rally in
Green Meadows Park, a grassy battleground between turfs controlled
by the Crips and Bloods gangs.
   Since the rally, volunteers have chased away gang members who
used to congregate near the tattered nets of the park's two tennis
courts.
   Cleanup patrols roamed gang- and drug-plagued Wadsworth Avenue
behind the park, painting over the graffiti on fences and houses.
   ``It's taking back your neighborhood. That's exactly what it
means,'' said Ferdia Harris, who moved to the community in 1948.
``When we moved out here it was not the same. The children weren't
running the streets. We've got to make this work.''

<HEAD>`Difficult Choices' Needed to Raise Funds for Drug War, Bennett Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug policy director William J. Bennett says
he doesn't think new taxes are needed to wage his expanded war on
drugs, but Congress must ``make some difficult choices'' to find
the money.
   Meanwhile, Bush budget director Richard G. Darman said the
administration may be forced to consider raising taxes next year
unless Congress agrees to cuts in Medicare and other entitlement
programs.
   Bennett on Sunday defended Nancy Reagan's ``Just Say No''
campaign and other Reagan administration efforts to combat drugs,
saying that drug users themselves _ not failed government policies
_ are to blame for the way the problem has spread through society.
   Asked on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' if he would recommend raising
taxes as part of his new anti-drug strategy, Bennett replied,
``Don't think we need taxes.''
   But he insisted, ``The money will be there. We will put our
cards on the table. We will suggest what we want to do and we will
propose spending more money. Then we will see what the Congress
wants to do.
   ``It means making some difficult choices,'' he said.
   Bennett by law must forward a new national strategy for fighting
drugs to Congress by Sept. 5. It is expected to call for a major
boost in federal spending and emphasize both tougher penalties for
individual drug use and mandatory treatment for addicts.
   Bennett was asked if his approach marks a reversal from the
Reagan administration policy, which cut funds for treatment and
emphasized drug interdiction and arrests of kingpins.
   The $21 billion spent fighting drugs during the Reagan
administration ``wasn't wasted, and it wasn't all wrong,'' said
Bennett. ``There were some real successes during the Reagan era.
   ``I don't think anyone can deny that drugs are pervasive
throughout much of America,'' said Bennett, although casual drug
use is down.
   ``Although some people like to criticize the educational efforts
and the first lady's efforts, they obviously have had some
effect,'' said Bennett.
   ``It's the people who are taking drugs that are causing these
tragedies, not the government,'' he said.
   Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said he
will recommend that Bush seek fiscal 1991 cuts in the growth of
Medicare, agriculture, veterans and other entitlement programs, but
not Social Security.
   Darman, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' repeated Bush's resolve not
to raise taxes, but said:
   ``When the Congress comes back in September, if they don't fully
implement the bipartisan budget agreement, we will have to have a
sequester, and it will drive us toward having to face the tax issue
the following year, which we shouldn't do.''
   He said the administration and the legislative branch must find
savings of $25 billion to $30 billion to avoid an automatic,
across-the-board cut under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit
reduction law.
   He said Medicare payments for doctors' fees have risen ``at
about 15 percent a year. That can't go on forever; it's going to
consume the whole budget. So we have to restrain the growth there.''
   ``There are going to be some wealthy doctors, presumably, who
aren't quite so wealthy in the future,'' he predicted.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Leland's Plane `Basically Disintegrated'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Leland-Reax, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are ready to help investigate
the crash in Ethiopia of a plane carrying Rep. Mickey Leland and
his party if that country's government requests aid, a Pentagon
official says.
   Navy Capt. Stan Bloyer said on Sunday the retrieval of remains
was expected to begin today at the mountainside crash site.
   ``We would like to extend our deepest sympathy and condolence to
the families involved,'' he said.
   The bodies were to be flown by helicopter to the village of
Dembidola north of the crash site, then ferried to the Ethiopian
capital of Addis Ababa by C-130 cargo plane.
   They were expected to arrive in the United States within two to
three days on board a C-141 medical evacuation aircraft, after a
stop at Torrejon Air Base near Madrid, Spain, where full mortuary
facilities are available, Bloyer said.
   Forensic and medical specialists were dispatched from Addis
Ababa to aid in the retrieval work.
   Bloyer said U.S. officials are ready to assist should the
Ethiopian government request help in conducting an inquiry into the
crash.
   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., who was aboard the MH-60 search and
rescue helicopter that first spotted the wreckage, relayed ``that
in his judgment there was no possibility of survivors,'' Bloyer
said.
   The State Department also expressed condolences, saying the
crash ``apparently has resulted in the death of all those aboard.''
   ``The condition of the plane is extensively destroyed, basically
disintegrated,'' Bloyer said. ``The wreckage is located on a ravine
on a very steep mountainside and there is evidence of a post-impact
fire.''
   Bloyer said it was unknown whether the pilot was headed for an
alternate destination when the plane crashed, but it did not appear
to be attempting an emergency landing.
   ``It appeared ... that it just impacted at cruise speed in the
side of the mountain,'' he said.
   Bloyer said the area where the crash occurred had been searched
earlier, but bad weather had made it difficult to find the
wreckage. The improved visibility on Sunday was a major factor in
locating the crash site in the rugged mountain terrain, he said.
   Sixteen people were believed on board, but Bloyer said officials
were unsure how many Ethiopian observers had joined the delegation,
making an immediate exact count impossible.
   Leland, a Texas Democrat who heads the House Select Committee on
Hunger, was bound for the Fugnido refugee camp near the Sudanese
border when the Twin Otter plane vanished in bad weather on Aug. 7.
He was accompanied by eight Americans, including three members of
his staff, a friend of the congressman, three workers for the U.S.
Agency for International Development, and the wife of one of the
AID officials.
   The U.S. government had mobilized a massive search team for the
rescue effort, involving hundreds of people and a variety of
aircraft, including U-2 spy planes.

   House Speaker Tom Foley knows his way around
the power corridors of the nation's capital. It's finding his new
office that occasionally has him doing an about-face.
   ``Old habits die hard,'' said Foley, admitting that he
occasionally leaves the House floor and finds himself heading down
the stairs toward his old office.
   For eight years, first as Democratic whip and then as majority
leader, the cozy suite on the ground floor in the original part of
the Capitol building was home to Foley, his staff and his aging dog
Alice.
   Tourists wandering the main hallway would often peek inside
trying to catch a glimpse of someone famous. When mice were
discovered scampering about, Foley brought in a cat.
   Numbered paint chips of varying shades of yellow were taped to a
wall for months.
   Now, along with the challenges of being one of the pre-eminent
politicians in the country, Foley has a new office suite just off
the House floor.
   ``All in all it would have been convenient and comfortable not
to move,'' said Foley. ``It doesn't feel like home. It is still
unfamiliar, slightly awkward.''
   Foley knows well that along with the power of his new office
come the trappings. Besides, his new office is convenient to the
floor and the cloakrooms where much of the day-to-day business of
the House is conducted.
   A month after moving, Foley and his staff are settling in
although boxes of files are still stacked in the corners and
painters still wander around touching up.
   Foley's private office looks a lot like his old one.
   The Texas longhorn orange walls that former Speaker Jim Wright
left behind are now the same vivid blue of Foley's previous office.
The comfortable grouping of living room furniture is the same as
are most of the paintings.
   ``I don't care for the institutional beige or green common to
most government buildings,'' said Foley. ``I prefer either white or
pale or very bright colors.''
   Even though his ceremonial office, where he meets the press
daily and greets some visitors, has a battleship-sized desk,
Foley's private office does not.
   ``I don't feel comfortable sitting behind a desk when talking
with people,'' said Foley, who spends most of his time in a
comfortable easy chair on the phone or wandering in and out of his
staff's offices.
   While his former office suite was like a crowded rabbit's warren
the new one is spacious. Staffers complain it is not as conducive
to the intense give-and-take sessions common in their former
quarters.
   The offices look out over the east front of the Capitol, with a
view of the Library of Congress and the Supreme Court through the
trees of a grass plaza.
   The new suite dates back only to the early 1960s when the east
front of the Capitol was extended, though Foley's ceremonial office
dates to the Civil War era and the nearby women members' lounge was
the room where John Quincy Adams died.
   Foley said he plans ``no major renovations,'' but the dining
room will receive a facelift as the new speaker wants to have a
more formal setting for lunches with such people as visiting
foreign dignitaries.
   As for Alice, Foley said his pet has ``made the adjustment
pretty well. We haven't really done that much except move furniture
around. It will take a couple of months to feel comfortable.''

<HEAD>Pell Fundraising Inactive as Schneider Gears up for Senate Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and a veteran of 28 years in Congress,
isn't acting like a politician interested in six more years when
his current term expires.
   While other senators up for re-election next year have already
raised hundreds of thousands of dollars _ and in some cases several
million _ Pell's fundraising activities have been moribund.
   The Rhode Island Democrat received only a single $5,000
contribution in the first half of this year despite the threat of a
strong Republican opponent for the first time in nearly two decades.
   Pell aides insist he plans to run for the seat but that he has
his own timetable and will begin fundraising when he is ready.
   Republicans, however, say Claudine Schneider, an aggressive and
popular five-term GOP congresswoman, has a good chance of winning
the seat even if Pell does run. They say the incumbent could be
vulnerable because of his age, the historic difficulties that
Foreign Relations Committee chairmen have faced and his passionate
interest in psychic phenomena.
   Democrats hold a 55-45 advantage in the Senate, and Pell is one
of six Democratic incumbents being targeted by national GOP
strategists for 1990.
   Pell's lack of fundraising contrasts sharply to the other 30
senators who have established campaign committees for a 1990
re-election bid. They have raised an average of nearly $750,000
each during the first six months of this year, according to
campaign disclosure reports filed at the Federal Election
Commission.
   The numbers are more curious considering the 70-year-old
Democrat is likely to face his toughest race since his hard-fought
1972 victory over Republican John H. Chafee, who won the state's
other Senate seat four years later.
   Next year Pell likely would face Miss Schneider, who has all but
announced a Senate run.
   Miss Schneider reported more than $200,000 in campaign
contributions to her House re-election committee for the
January-June FEC reporting period.
   ``When he knows he could face someone as aggressive as Claudine
Schneider, I don't see how he can afford to take that passive
attitude,'' said Wendy DeMocker, a spokeswoman for the National
Republican Senatorial Committee.
   Pell aides say the senator's lack of fundraising is merely an
outgrowth of his concern that the campaign season has become too
long.
   ``He has said repeatedly he has every intention of running,''
said a senior Pell aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``He just feels very strongly that the campaign process has gotten
out of hand.''
   Pell does have $444,686 in his campaign coffers in preparation
for 1990, but 21 of the 30 other senators running next year have
more, according to FEC documents.
   Pell is one of the most popular politicians in Rhode Island
history, winning his Senate seat in 1960 by defeating two former
governors in a primary. He has been a leading advocate for the arts
and education and in 1986 became chairman of the powerful Foreign
Relations Committee.
   But chairmen of that committee have in the past have suffered at
re-election time, attacked by challengers who charge they are
paying too much attention to international problems and not enough
to parochial concerns. Five years ago, Democrat Paul Simon unseated
then-Foreign Relations Chairman Charles Percy, R-Ill.
   Miss Schneider has statewide recognition since Rhode Island has
only two House seats. And she is the type of Republican that
Democratic-dominated Rhode Island likes _ a liberal on social
issues with a strong environmental record.
   Age also could become a factor. Miss Schneider is 42, the same
age Pell was when he first came to the Senate nearly 30 years ago.
   Pell will be 71 in November and would be 78 at the end of
another six-year term.
   Pell, however, would still be a youngster compared to his
predecessor. Theodore Green came to the Senate at age 69 and
retired in 1960 at age 93.

<HEAD>Pesticide Group Says Farmers Could Help Keep Chemicals on the Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers who grow so-called minor crops may
want to band together to help pesticide manufacturers supply data
needed to keep chemicals on the market, says a spokesman for the
National Agricultural Chemicals Association.
   ``Manufacturers will not make pesticides that are not
profitable,'' said Ray S. McAllister, director of regulatory
affairs for the NACA.
   Many pesticides used on minor crops are being dropped because of
the high cost of tests needed to prove to the Environmental
Protection Agency that any residue left on the food is harmless to
humans, he said.
   ``I don't envision the individual farmer getting involved,''
said McAllister. But there may be a group producing a specialty
crop that could supply the resources for doing the tests, he said.
   Examples of crops affected are berries, cucumbers, melons,
squashes, kale, mustard greens, rutabaga, spinach, turnips,
asparagus, celery, lettuce, onion, peppers, pimiento, peanuts,
sunflowers, kumquats, papaya, sugar beets and garlic.
   An NACA survey directed by McAllister found that manufacturers
plan to cancel 20 commonly used pesticides because of the testing
requirements, while 39 others would be canceled for at least one
food use. Cost of testing was the most frequently cited reason for
dropping a chemical.
   The testing requirement is mandated by the 1988 amendments to
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.
   ``This is the first time complete re-registration is being
done,'' said Arthur Grube, economic analyst with the EPA. He said
it is to be completed by 1997.
   ``It is probable that some chemicals will disappear,'' he said,
saying they would be the ones used in relatively small volumes
which require significant testing.
   But he said Congress decided that ``if this stuff was going out
into the environment it was worth it'' to know how safe it is.
   He acknowledged that over the years, laws have become more
demanding because technology exists to research long-term health
effects of chemical use instead of just the immediate result of
exposure.
   ``We are going to pay for it,'' said Grube. ``But I think if you
asked most people if they were willing to pay a dollar more for
groceries to be assured the pesticide used on the food wouldn't
cause cancer, they'd pay it.''
   The EPA has said it will try to be flexible with chemical
manufacturers on some of the testing.
   McAllister said, for example, if a chemical has already been
tested on one kind of produce, he has been told certain assumptions
would be allowed without further tests on its effects on other
foods.
   Meanwhile, Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., will hold hearings next
month on legislation that would speed up the removal of pesticides
with proven health risks.
   The bill would create a review process to continually upgrade
health and safety information on pesticides, and put an ``early
warning system'' in place to keep agriculture research and
extension work ahead of pesticide regulatory decisions, he said.
   It would change the cancellation process, which currently
requires administrative hearings and grants a transition period to
farmers left with no pest control alternatives.
   Brown is chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on
department operations, research and foreign agriculture.

<BYLINE>Drug Tests Flag Risk of Poor Job Performance, Study Says ^By MALCOLM

<TEXT>
   Postal workers who tested positive for drug
use were more prone to absenteeism and getting fired, according to
a new study that could give private employers an indication of the
cost of workers' drug use.
   The analysis, one of the first studies of its kind, found that
drug users had a 41 percent higher absence rate and about a 40
percent higher rate of being fired, said researcher Jacques Normand.
   Results suggest that by spending about $1.8 million a year to
screen job applicants for drugs, the post office could avoid about
$3.1 million in costs related to absenteeism and firing in the
first year, he said. Over three years, the avoided costs would
surpass $17 million, he said.
   For private employers, the study provides hard data showing that
drug screening results are related to later job performance, he
said.
   Normand, a senior industrial psychologist at the U.S. Postal
Service in Washington, presented the study Sunday at the annual
meeting of the American Psychological Association.
   Few well-designed studies have examined the cost to employers of
worker drug use, commented Steven Gust of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse.
   Estimates have relied mostly on anecdotal information instead,
said Gust, who called Normand's work provocative.
   Normand said the post office is phasing in drug testing as part
of its evaluation of job applicants.
   Results of the drug tests on people included in the study were
not revealed to personnel officials to ensure that the results did
not influence hiring decisions.
   A total of 5,465 applicants at 21 hiring sites across the
country were screened by urine test for use of amphetamines,
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, marijuana, methadone,
opiates and phencyclidine.
   The job performance analysis focused on the 4,220 applicants who
were hired and completed a standard 90-day probationary period. Of
this group, 373 had tested positive for at least one drug.
   Among those testing positive, 251 showed evidence of marijuana
use only and 88 for cocaine use with or without marijuana. The
others fell in other categories.
   Absenteeism was calculated as the percentage of assigned working
hours that the employee was out sick, absent without pay or absent
without official leave. The calculations were done after an average
of eight months on the job.
   Workers who had tested positive for drug use were absent for an
average of 4.2 percent of their assigned working hours, in
comparison to 3 percent for the other workers in the study, Normand
said.
   The difference per employee is small, but it becomes more
significant when applied to a large workforce, Gust of the drug
institute said.
   Normand estimated that the greater absenteeism would cost the
post office $2.6 million in one year when applied to workers hired
that year.
   He also said the cost probably would increase as workers stay on
the payroll, because new workers are encouraged not to take leave
during their probationary period.
   The study also found 13 percent of positive-testing employees
had been fired, compared to 9.5 percent of those who had tested
negative.
   Gust said the study does not address the question of whether
drug use directly affects performance on the job. However, drug
test results may act as a proxy for some other behavioral or
personality trait that affects job performance, he said.
   The study is ``a marvelous take-off point'' for investigating
that issue, he said.

<TEXT>
   It's a question many pet owners would rather not
ask: What happens to the remains of the hundreds of thousands of
dogs and cats that are destroyed each year?
   Part of the answer is clear, though gruesome: As many as a third
wind up in rendering plants, where their remains are broken down
into a variety of products.
   Which products, however, is harder to say.
   Over the years various reports have traced pet remains to soap
and cosmetics, which are made with animal fats.
   Last week The Wall Street Journal, in an article on New York
City's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said
unclaimed stray pets destroyed at the society's shelter are
collected by a rendering plant in New Jersey where they are
``boiled down to byproducts used in cosmetics and other products.''
The article said a kitten could wind up ``as a bar of soap.''
   Are New Yorkers washing themselves with their former pets?
   Vito Turso, spokesman for the Sanitation Department, said
although the city pays $150,000 a year to Darling-Delaware Inc. to
collect the carcasses, he did not know what the renderer does with
them.
   The Newark, N.J., plant manager, Anton Weir, referred calls to
John Grayson, division manager. A half-dozen calls over three days
to Grayson were not returned.
   What really happens to pet remains brought to rendering plants?
Probably nothing sinister, according to an industry spokesman.
   Dr. Russell John, director of technical services for the
National Renderers Association, said almost all the small animals
collected by renderers are turned into animal feed or fertilizer.
   Soaps and cosmetics require high quality, white animal fats, he
explained. Those come mostly from cattle, not dogs and cats, and
accordingly they are acquired from slaughterhouses, not animal
shelters.
   Gerald McEwen, vice president for science with the Cosmetic,
Toiletry and Fragrance Association, said it ``boggles the mind'' to
think cat or dog remains would be used in cosmetics, given
manufacturers' needs for pure beef tallow.
   Even if pet remains are not in personal cosmetics, the problem
of disposing of animal carcasses is a disturbing and persistent one
for the nation's animal shelters and veterinary facilities, which
have three options: cremate the animals, bury them in a sanitary
landfill or turn them over to a renderer.
   Cremation is either illegal or impractical in many large cities,
including New York, Los Angeles and Washington, and landfills are
closing around the country.
   That leaves renderers, who cook down animal remains to obtain
substances used in a variety of manufactured products. In Los
Angeles, for example, remains are used to make fertilizer.
   Such uses ``do offend some people's sensibilities,'' said
Barbara Cassidy of the Humane Society of the United States.
   But given the vast numbers of stray or unwanted pets that must
be destroyed each year _ the Los Angeles County shelter alone puts
about 25,000 dogs and cats to sleep _ rendering is widely viewed as
a form of recycling.
   ``You're grateful if anyone will come and take the bodies
away,'' said Ingrid Newkirk, director of People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals and a former director of a Washington, D.C.,
animal shelter.
   ``They don't keep well. You have to put them in giant freezers.
It's hideous. A lousy, lousy situation,'' she said.
   Shelters that turn animal remains over to renderers usually
offer pet owners an alternative, including cremation and burial in
a pet cemetery. Cremation costs between $35 and $50, but a casket
and cemetery plot can cost more than $500.
   A person who puts an animal up for adoption in a shelter is told
the beast will be put to sleep if a suitable owner cannot be found
within a few days.
   But, ``usually, people don't want to deal with the remains,''
said Ed Cubrda, director of the Los Angeles SPCA. ``A lot of people
don't know what happens to them, and a lot don't want to know.''

   Thousands of workers rallied in this union
stronghold to offer support for striking miners, Eastern Airlines
workers and telephone employees and to show America's labor
movement is still a strong force.
   ``It's time we locked arms and marched together. It's time we
stood in the street and sat in the street together to show them
that this movement is on the march,'' Richard Trumka, president of
the United Mine Workers, said Sunday.
   ``Labor is not dead, and we will not die,'' said John Hovis,
president of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers.
   Members of dozens of labor unions came came by bus, car and
truck to Pittsburgh, headquarters of the United Electrical, Radio
and Machine Workers and the United Steelworkers. They marched
through downtown streets waving picket signs and American flags,
then gathered for the afternoon rally.
   Police estimated the crowd at one point at 5,000.
   The UMW has been on strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc.
since April in a dispute over wages and benefits. About 46,000
fellow union members stayed off the job for about a month in
wildcat sympathy strikes.
   The strike affects 1,900 Pittston miners in West Virginia,
Virginia and Kentucky. Union and company officials have been
meeting in Duffield, Va., but Trumka said the two sides remain far
apart.
   The UMW leader said workers must stop asking for, and begin
demanding, fair and decent contracts.
   ``The labor laws are designed for us to lose every single
time,'' he said. ``They are set up for a never-win situation with
labor unless and until we stand united and don't give lip service
to solidarity but give true service to solidarity.''
   United Steelworkers President Lynn Williams urged union members
everywhere to ``hang in there until we make the point and make it
well.''
   ``What time is it?'' USW Vice President Leon Lynch repeatedly
asked the workers, many of whom wore green camouflage outfits and
armbands to the rally.
   ``Union time,'' they shouted again and again.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, in a letter read at the rally,
chastised President Bush for doing nothing to help end the Pittston
strike. He also asked Congress to intervene in the Eastern dispute
and ``to recognize the legitimate interests of working people.''
   Many at Sunday's rally carried signs attacking Frank Lorenzo,
chairman of Texas Air Corp., parent company of Eastern and
Continental airlines. Others wore patches that bore circles with
lines through Lorenzo's name.
   Eastern machinists went on strike in March and were joined by
pilots and flight attendants. The walkouts virtually grounded the
airline, but the carrier has restored service at one-third the
pre-strike level.
   Wayne Dolan of the Airline Pilots Association said most Eastern
pilots remain on the picket line.
   ``We lost a lot of our pilots to other airlines. We lost them to
the Trump Shuttle. But we didn't lose them to Frank Lorenzo,''
Dolan said.
   Billowing over the crowd at the rally were red balloons
distributed by the Communications Workers of America, whose members
went on strike against Bell Atlantic Corp. on Aug. 6 in a dispute
over wages and health benefits. Bell Atlantic operates in
Pennsylvania, five other Eastern states and the District of
Columbia.
   ``I know it's wrong when a company making billions and billions
of dollars like Bell tries to take from its employees,'' Trumka
said.
   The CWA on Sunday struck Ameritech, a regional telephone company
serving the Midwest. The union and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers also are on strike against two other Baby Bells,
NYNEX and Pacific Telesis.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Sharply Against Yen, Tokyo Stocks Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar moved up against the Japanese yen
during afternoon trading on Monday, while share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange recovered morning losses.
   The dollar opened at 141.85 yen, up 1.75 yen from last Friday's
140.10-yen close, and finished at 141.93 yen. It varied between
141.48 yen and 141.95 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 6.84 points in
trading Friday, declined another 41.34 points, or 0.12 percent, to
close at 34,671.62 points.
   The U.S. currency's jump at the opening of the Tokyo market
followed gains in New York last Friday as investors were reassured
by economic indicators released in Washington, said a trader with
the Bank of Tokyo.
   The U.S. producer price index for July fell by 0.4 percent,
while the retail price index for July rose by 0.9 percent from the
previous month, indicating stability in the U.S. economy, analysts
said.
   ``The market started higher, but sales in the interbank market
and profit-taking pushed the dollar downward,'' said a trader at
Mitsui Bank.
   But the market appeared locked into a fixed range, she said.
   ``There were buyers when the dollar hit a low, and sellers when
it reached a high,'' she said.
   On the stock exchange, trading was thin with many market traders
taking summer holidays this week, said Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader at
New Japan Securities.
   ``Being a Monday morning, many traders were taking a
wait-and-see attitude,'' he said.
   There was some selective trading of high-tech issues, however,
he said.
   Nomura predicted there would be little movement this week.

<HEAD>Opposition Nominee Offers to Step Aside for La Prensa Director</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Social Christian
Party says he'll drop his bid for the presidency and back the head
of the opposition La Prensa newspaper if she is nominated by a
national coalition group.
   The opposition Social Christians, one of the country's
best-organized political groups, on Sunday nominated its leader
Erick Ramirez as its candidate in the presidential election set for
February by the leftist Sandinista government.
   But Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, director of La Prensa, has been
mentioned as a possible candidate and has said she would accept the
nomination by the 12-party National Opposition Union if offered.
   ``I would give up (my candidacy) and support her'' if the union
nominates her, Ramirez, a 45-year-old businessman, told The
Associated Press by telephone.
   The center-left Social Christians, founded in 1957, broke away
from the National Opposition Union and is one of 21 parties,
ranging from communist to conservative, registered in Nicaragua.
   The Sandinista government of President Daniel Ortega has
scheduled elections for Feb. 25. The elections are part of a pact
reached by five Central American presidents that includes an
agreement for the disbanding of Nicaraguan rebels.
   The Sandinistas have not yet announced their nominee.
   Luis Vega Miranda, a Social Christian spokesman, said that in
addition to nominating Ramirez the party convention approved a
platform to create a government ``based on the search for a
democratic society and community, dignity, liberty and personal
freedom.''
   The platform calls for an economic system ``neither capitalist
nor communist,'' an end to conscription, independence from the
superpowers, abolition of repressive organizations and agrarian
reform, he said.
   Ramirez said the party is ``a historical alternative between the
Sandinista and Somoza dictatorships.'' The Sandinistas led the
revolt that toppled the rightist government of President Anastasio
Somoza in 1979.
   Ortega and the presidents of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador
and Costa Rica announced at a summit last Monday in Honduras a
120-day timetable to disband and resettle the rebels, known as
Contras, who are based at camps in Honduras near the border with
Nicaragua.
   In exchange, the Sandinista government promised a general
amnesty for Contras who return home and electoral and press freedom.

<HEAD>Co-Inventor of Transistor William Shockley Dies At Stanford</HEAD>

   By helping to invent the transistor,
William Shockley did as much to shape the modern world as Louis
Pasteur or Madame Curie, colleagues said. But he died with a
reputation tarnished by his controversial racial theories.
   Shockley, who shared the 1956 Nobel Prize for physics, died
Saturday of prostate cancer at his home on the campus of Stanford
University, the university said Sunday. He was 79.
   He was among the fathers of the electronic age but spent his
later years embroiled in controversy over his theory that
intelligence is genetically based, and that blacks as a group are
inferior to whites.
   ``I would say he would have to be compared to people who opened
up huge new areas, such as Pasteur or the Salk vaccine,'' said
Professor William E. Spicer, Shockley's friend and colleague for 33
years.
   ``But certainly the controversies he got into later in life made
it much more difficult for him to get recognition for his key
contribution,'' said Spicer, a professor of electrical engineering
at Stanford.
   Shockley shared the Nobel Prize with his colleagues from Bell
Laboratories, John Bardeen and the late Walter H. Brattain. He also
was professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford.
   The team's first device, developed during what they later called
a ``magic month'' during 1947, was an innovation that made vacuum
tubes obsolete and the electronic age possible. Most modern
devices, from airplanes to wristwatches to computers, contain the
technical descendants of Shockley's work.
   Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories, the company he founded
after leaving Bell labs in 1954, was instrumental in the birth of
Silicon Valley and the electronics industry. His former employees
later invented the integrated circuit and the microprocessor, the
building blocks of the computer age.
   ``It's a great loss for Stanford,'' said Joseph W. Goodman,
chairman of the school's electrical engineering department.
   Shockley ``has made the most important revolution in the 20th
century,'' Makoto Kikuchi, the executive technical adviser of Sony
Corp. who has known Shockely since 1960, said in an interview. ``He
had not imagined his invention would lead to such a rapid
revolution in electronics.,''
   Shockley's sparked campus demonstrations by claiming that
intellectually inferior blacks were producing children faster than
mentally superior whites. His genetic theories also prompted debate
over the use of IQ tests in schools and over why blacks failed to
score as well as whites. Most experts have blamed this outcome on
biased tests and other factors not related to genetics.
   Many of Shockley's scientific colleagues ridiculed his racial
theories and abandoned their association with him, claiming he had
passed beyond his field of expertise and was acting irresponsibly.
   In his later years, Shockley tried several times to befriend
blacks he came into contact with, Spicer said. ``I think he very
much would have liked to have found a black person who would be a
personal friend,'' he said.
   A 1980 article in The Atlanta Constitution comparing Shockley's
theories to Nazism drew a libel suit from Shockley, who sued the
newspaper for $1.25 million. A federal jury awarded him $1 in the
case, and the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986 turned down Shockley's
attempt to revive the lawsuit.
   Shockley's wife, Emmy, said he considered his research on
intelligence his most valuable work and that he continued to write
papers on the subject until a few days before his death.
   At the age of 68, he contributed his sperm to a sperm bank in
Southern California that founders said was designed to help pass on
the genetic makeup of ``geniuses.''
   Shockley, whose father was a mining engineer and whose
grandfather was a whaling captain, was born in London and grew up
in Palo Alto, near the campus where he died.
   He was one of the children tested in Louis Terman's classic
study of gifted children but failed to test high enough to advance
to the follow-up study. He was fond of pointing out that Terman
passed over two later Nobel Prize winners.
   Shockley received his Ph.D. in the then-esoteric field of
solid-state physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in 1932 and joined the staff of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co.'s Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., in 1936.
   After a year of working on vacuum tubes as replacements for
mechanical switches in telephone exchanges, Shockley resumed his
research on how electrons behaved with crystals. He met Brattain
through that work.
   World War II put a stop to the research. Shockley went to work
for the government, and did not return to Bell Labs until 1945,
about the time that Bardeen joined.
   With Shockley and Bardeen as theoreticians and Brattain as the
experimenter, the team resumed efforts to create a solid-state
device that would amplify electronic signals like the more
vulnerable, bulkier and power-hungry vacuum tubes of the day.
Research teams at MIT, General Electric, Purdue University and the
University of Pennsylvania also were in the race.
   On Dec. 23, 1947, the Bell Labs team conducted the first
successful demonstration of a crude transistor: a pair of metal
cat's whiskers, 2,000th of an inch apart, stuck into a slab of
germanium.
   Shockley is survived by his wife; three children from a previous
marriage, two sons, William and Richard, and a daughter Alison
Ianelli; and one granddaughter.

<HEAD>`The Abyss' Makes $8.6 Million Weekend Box Office Splash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Abyss'' dove into the summer's pool of
blockbuster movies with an estimated $8.6 million box office splash
in its first weekend, putting the film second only to
``Parenthood,'' an industry source said.
   ``Parenthood,'' directed by Ron Howard, took in an estimated
$9.6 million, said the source, who asked not to be identified. In
third-place was ``A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,''
bringing in about $8.3 million.
   ``The Abyss,'' the $43 million underwater science-fiction drama
by 20th Century Fox, made a solid opening Wednesday, taking in $2.1
million at the national box office for a per-screen average of
$1,406, Daily Variety reported.
   The movie stars Ed Harris as the foreman of an experimental
underwater oil rig commandeered by a group of Navy SEALS to salvage
a wrecked U.S. nuclear submarine. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays
the foreman's wife and designer of the oil rig who makes contact
with alien beings.
   Much of the film was shot in the cooling tank of an unfinished
nuclear power plant in South Carolina that was filled with 7.5
million gallons of water.
   Cast and crew spent about 40 percent of a 3{-month shooting
schedule underwater. The work required director James Cameron,
actors, camera operators and a squad of technicians to remain
beneath the surface for up to 10 hours a day, often until 4 a.m.
   ``Parenthood'' stars Steve Martin, Tom Hulce, Jason Robards and
Dianne Wiest in an ensemble family drama that also features Mary
Steenburgen, Rick Moranis, Keanu Reeves and Martha Plimpton.

<TEXT>
   A city that thought itself free of the worst of
big-city problems has witnessed a summer of drive-by shootings,
murders and drug running, with violent crime nearly double what it
was a year ago.
   Queen Hyler, whose son was beaten unconscious by a street gang,
says Milwaukee residents are fed up.
   ``It's going to be turned around in Milwaukee. People are not
going to put up with this,'' said Ms. Hyler. ``And I'm prepared to
die for it. I refuse to give one inch to the drug dealers.''
   The sudden outbreak of violence and illegal drugs has shocked
residents of this city, which has strong ethnic roots, a tradition
of progressive government and a history of low crime rates.
   Through the first seven months of 1989, there were 69 murders,
compared to 54 for the same period last year. There were 1,020
violent crimes through July 1, compared to 565 for the first six
months of 1988.
   Acting Police Chief LeRoy A. Jahnke said the majority of the
city's violence has been drug-related.
   Jahnke has increased overtime staffing, putting 48 more officers
on the streets between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., when many shootings have
occurred. A new system that will allow clerks to write reports
formerly written by police officers should put 100 more officers on
the streets.
   To curb the growing supply of arms on city streets, Alderwoman
Larraine McNamara-McGraw said she would support an ordinance
banning the sale of small-caliber weapons.
   She also praised a program introduced in late July by Mayor John
O. Norquist, encouraging residents to turn in unwanted firearms to
police stations.
   After her teen-age son Byron was severely beaten by gang members
last year, Ms. Hyler took to social activism and became president
of the People United Association.
   Her group has staged marches and vigils this summer to call
attention to the growing crime problems in Milwaukee, particularly
on the highly segregated North Side where most of the city's black
population lives.
   Ms. Hyler said she worked hard to make a home in Milwaukee, and
she will not let drugs ruin her neighborhood.
   ``Somebody has to move, and I'm not going,'' she said.
   Still, she said, fighting the image of the drug dealer is often
difficult because it frequently takes a few years for authorities
to convict a violator. By that time, she said, young people have
already been dazzled by the dealer's Mercedes, gold chains and
other luxuries.
   ``It's hard to tell a kid that's not the right road,'' she said,
noting that working for the minimum wage of $3.65 an hour is not an
attractive alternative to the lucrative drug business.
   In addition to its lobbying efforts, People United offers young
people scholarships, group discussion sessions and constructive
youth recreation.
   ``We try to make kids feel good about themselves,'' and give
them good role models, she said.
   Ms. McNamara-McGraw agreed with that approach.
   She said education can raise young people's sense of dignity,
and can dissuade youths from ``buying into'' the drug world.
   ``We're a salvageable city,'' she said.

<HEAD>Health Insurance Costs To Be Major Labor Issue In Future</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The battle over health insurance cost-sharing that
helped spark phone workers' strikes in 20 states is likely to crop
up in many industries in the 1990s, according to business and labor
officials.
   Fifty percent of the union leaders and 38 percent of the
business leaders surveyed in a recent study commissioned by
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. said employee payments for health
insurance would be one of the top six negotiating priorities for
this year.
   ``Health care has been a major issue on the bargaining table and
as we progress into the '90s, it will become the No. 1 or No. 2
issue,'' Lorrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO in
Washington, said Friday.
   ``It certainly does seem to be a trend that will be a major
focal point with the rate health care costs are growing,'' said
Karen Brigham of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States.
   Health insurance has been the principal bargaining issue in the
contract talks among the seven ``Baby Bells'' and the unions that
represent their more than 300,000 workers.
   Workers at NYNEX Corp., Bell Atlantic Corp. and Pacific Telesis
went on strike last week, and workers struck Ameritech on Sunday.
   Workers and company officials reached agreement at BellSouth,
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. and U S West. In the latter two,
strikes were averted when the companies agreed to surrender their
demands that workers pay a share of health insurance premiums,
which up to now had been 100 percent company paid.
   Earlier this year, AT&amp;T averted a threatened strike by
abandoning demands that workers pay a share of health premiums.
   Ms. Brigham said health care costs have been rising at more than
twice the rate of inflation in the past few years.
   ``Employers realize they cannot absorb these increases year
after year and remain competitive,'' she said. ``Part of the
solution is to inject a little more individual responsibility into
the picture.''
   Ms. McHugh agreed on the need to get health care costs under
control but disagreed on the solution.
   ``We recognize the fact that as health care costs continue to
escalate, there needs to be an equitable solution, but if you
continue to shift the burden, you create barriers to care for many
working Americans,'' she said.
   The AFL-CIO's preferred solution, she said, is a national health
insurance plan. She said the umbrella labor organization will start
a campaign in November for an overhaul of the nation's health care
system.
   Myles Calvey, business manager of the Quincy, Mass.-based Local
2222 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said
NYNEX was profitable enough to be able to pay its workers' health
insurance coverage.
   But Peter Cronin, a spokesman for New England Telephone, a
division of NYNEX, said the company would be unusual if it
continued providing full health insurance coverage at no cost to
the workers.
   ``The way things have developed because of the high costs of
medical care, about 80 percent of the businesses in the country
require some kind of co-payment. The unusual thing is we have been
able to continue full payment as long as we have,'' Cronin said.

manatee.
   Now the state that has led the nation in recreational boating
deaths for the past two years is trying to establish a boating
speed limit, require more education and charge higher license fees
to bring the boating explosion under control.
   There are some 700,000 boat owners in the state _ seven times
the number of registered boaters in 1961. And that figure is
expected to double in the next 10 years, according to Florida
Marine Patrol estimates. Many boaters strongly oppose any new
regulations.
   The boating fatality rate in Florida is 2{ times the national
average, with the number of deaths soaring from 40 in 1986 to 102
in 1987 and 105 last year.
   The recent outcry for greater regulation was sparked by a
Memorial Day weekend collision along the Intercoastal Waterway in
Pinellas County that killed four teen-agers.
   Dr. William LaTorre, 48, was arrested Tuesday and charged with
four counts of manslaughter by culpable negligence after his sleek
35-foot boat collided with a 17-foot boat carrying five teen-agers
on the state's west coast near St. Petersburg.
   This week, the heads of state agencies will hold public hearings
in Orlando on a proposal by the Department of Natural Resources to
set a statewide speed limit of 30 mph, and 20 mph in 12 counties
heavily populated by manatees. The proposed speed limits are
scheduled to be voted on at a Sept. 14 Cabinet meeting.
   ``I think there's not a lot of sentiment right now for a
statewide (speed) zone,'' said Sally Munroe, an aide to Gov. Bob
Martinez.
   Marjorie Lamphear, education director of Save the Manatee Club
in Maitland, says the lower speed limits proposed for the 12
counties could help the manatee _ a large sea mammal also known as
sea cows.
   ``Manatees do recognize danger and try to get out of the way,''
she said. ``But between a speeding boat and a slow manatee, the
combination is not in favor of the manatee.''
   Between January and July, 103 manatees have been found dead,
with 37 deaths attributed to vessels, according the natural
resources department. During the same period last year, 29 of 93
manatee deaths were blamed on boaters. An estimated 1,200 of the
docile, plant-eating creatures, weighing more than 3,000 pounds and
ranging from eight to 14 feet long, live in Florida.
   ``We could lose 150 this year,'' Ms. Lamphear said. ``We need to
take drastic measures.''
   Next month, the natural resources department will ask the
governor and his Cabinet for mandatory education for boaters and
higher license fees to help pay for better enforcement of boating
laws, according to a draft report released last week by the agency.
   Some view the proposed regulations as an unnecessary intrusion.
   Last spring, the Legislature rejected a boating safety bill that
included a statewide speed limit.
   ``Why the heck should the government be sticking its nose in
something that should be individually involved?'' asked state Rep.
Jim King.
   Jim Robinson, state executive director of the Marine Industries
Association, doubts a 30 mph speed limit will lower the number of
deaths.
   Speed isn't the prime factor behind boating deaths, he
contended. They also were caused by lack of life jackets,
overloaded craft, carelessness and bad weather conditions, he said.
   Robinson called the proposed regulations an imposition on the
public, and warned, ``You better believe there's going to be a
battle.''
   But Col. Don Ellingsen, director of the Florida Marine Patrol,
said the regulations are needed because of the increasing
congestion on Florida waterways and the increase in speed.
   ``We don't believe that 30 mph will affect the vast majority of
boat owners,'' he said. ``We are trying to slow down the floating
rockets that go 80 to 100 mph.''

   A firebomb set a car ablaze
today and injured the four Israelis inside, the army said.
   Witnesses in this town north of Jerusalem said the four were tax
collectors riding in a car belonging to Israel's tax department
when at least two firebombs were thrown at the vehicle.
   An army spokesman said the injured were civilians but declined
to say whether they worked with the tax department.
   Ramallah and neighboring El Bireh, both about eight miles north
of Jerusalem, have recently been the scenes of battles over
non-payment of taxes as part of the 20-month Palestinian uprising
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Withholding taxes has been a major tactic of the uprising, and
earlier this month merchants in the area staged a one-day general
strike to protest the government's seizure of their identity papers
to force payment of taxes.
   Two of the victims suffered moderate to serious burns and two
were slightly injured, according to a spokesman at Hadassah
Hospital in the Jerusalem suburb of Ein Karem.
   Soldiers clamped a curfew on the area where the firebomb was
thrown and began rounding up suspects.
   An army spokesman, who is not identified under military
regulations, would not say how many were arrested, but at least
eight youths were seen in the custody of soldiers.
   Soldiers also began welding shut at least 10 neighborhood shops,
which the army commonly does as punishment when firebombs or stones
cause injuries.
   The army spokesman said two youths threw two or three firebombs
at the car on Palestine Street, near the Kadoura refugee camp, in
an area where stones and bottles have frequently been thrown at
Israeli vehicles.
   After the incident, soldiers also seized identity cards and
videotapes from two Palestinians who work as part-time cameramen
for television networks.
   Also in the West Bank, masked youths set ablaze a bus carrying
Arab workers to jobs in Israel, Israel radio said. No one was
reported injured in the attack in Nablus, the West Bank's largest
city.
   At least 536 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with
soldiers or Israeli civilians during the uprising. Thirty-eight
Israelis also have been slain.

   If you have something ``awesome'' to
sell to kids, forget it.
   And don't say ``fresh,'' because that bit of kidspeak is rapidly
going stale.
   The dweebs at the ad agencies don't always know it, but
appropriating teen-age slang for commercial purposes is like
totally risky. As sure as this year's stone-washed jeans become
next year's bell bottoms, the odd-sounding usages of youth can
tumble from the cutting edge to oblivion before they reach the ears
of adults.
   That's where Karen Forcade of Youth Research, a consulting
company, comes in.
   Companies such as Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nabisco
and Campbell's Soup hire Forcade, 45, to tell them how to
communicate with younger consumers.
   ``Children are very sensitive to the language that is used,''
Forcade said, adding that they regard ad writers who sling outmoded
terms at them as dweebs _ the latest word for ``nerds'' or
``geeks.'' A current toy commercial in which the child actor
exclaims ``awesome,'' for instance, is regarded as just awful.
   The lingo of youth is evanescent. A recent alternative to
``cool'' cropped up some years ago in ``radical'' (later shortened
to ``rad''). That gave way to ``critical'' (shortened, naturally to
``crit''). Now both terms are passe.
   Maureen Leopold, a counselor at Danbury High School, warns that
adults would be wise to leave kidspeak to the kids _ lest they
stumble, embarrass themselves and attain dweebhood.

   Twenty months have passed since a debate
by six Democratic presidential candidates at Pan American
University, but the judges who agreed to pay for the event still
owe $9,100.
   The university turned to a collection agency last week after its
repeated failure to get the Southwest Texas County Judges
Association to pay.
   Zapata County Judge Angel A. Flores was the only one of the 29
judges sponsoring the event who had paid his bill by then. A second
judge, Hidalgo County Judge J. Edgar Ruiz, paid his share on
Thursday.
   Ruiz, whose county hosted the Dec. 15, 1987, event, said the
judges always intended to pay the bill, but somehow ``put it aside
and just never got to it.''
   He said university officials ``have been more than patient with
us.''
   The candidates who took part in the debate were Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, Sen. Paul Simon
of Illinois, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   Pan American spokesman Bruce Erickson said university policy
prohibits the state-supported school from sponsoring partisan
activities, but that such activities are permitted when paid for by
off-campus groups.

   Strong thunderstorms moved across the upper Mississippi Valley
and the northern Plains early today, while rain continued to soak
New England.
   In South Dakota, hail an inch in diameter covered the ground at
Avon and marble-size hail fell on Brookings.
   Thunderstorms were diminishing over the northern Rockies after
one storm dumped more than a third of an inch of rain in two
minutes at Pony, Mont.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms, some with locally heavy
rainfall, extended from the Texas panhandle into central Oklahoma.
Between 1 and 2{ inches of rain drenched the Oklahoma City, Okla.,
area Sunday night.
   Strong thunderstorms scattered over southern New Mexico downed
power lines near Hobbs. Strong thunderstorms also were scattered
across the upper Great Lakes.
   An upper air disturbance triggered showers and thunderstorms
with heavy rains over New England. More than 2 inches of rain fell
Sunday in Boston.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included more than 2{ inches at Oklahoma City, Okla., nearly 1{
inches at Burlington, Vt., and more than an inch at Eau Claire,
Wis., and Spencer, Iowa.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms over Iowa,
the upper Great Lakes, Florida and much of the Atlantic Coast; and
scattered showers and thunderstorms from central Texas into

   The area contaminated by the Chernobyl nuclear
accident will be made a sanctuary to study such phenomena as
strangely heavy pine needles and rodents with genetic
abnormalities, the official Tass news agency said today.
   Three regions of Byelorussia that were evacuated after the 1986
accident will be set aside for scientists to observe how radiation
affects plants and wildlife, Tass said. Some sections of the
Ukraine on the other side of Chernobyl are already study areas.
   Tass said pine needles in parts of the poisoned forests remained
normal size but were ten times heavier than normal and that some
conifers had frown into giants.
   Scientists found high radiation levels in reservoirs, and
especially high levels in fish that feed off other fish, including
pike and perch.
   Although some rodents ``developed genetic abnormalities, no
marked changes occurred in their condition and behavior,'' Tass
said.
   Among mammals, wild boars, foxes and rabbits showed the highest
radiation readings, but scientists observed no abnormal behavior
among them, Tass said.
   The explosion and fire at the northern Ukraine nuclear plant's
No. 4 reactor April 26, 1986 killed 31 people and released a cloud
of radioactive material that eventually circled the globe. More
than three years later, the effects continue to be felt.
   Last week Tass reported that 3,000 people are preparing to
evacuate a small section of Russia near the power plant where
radiation has doubled the amount of illness. It did not specify
which illnesses became more common.
   The report followed a dispute between the government and
scientists in Byelorussia about further evacuations. Byelorussian
officials say an extra 11,000 people should be evacuated, but
scientists say some 106,000 should be removed, based on radiation
levels in the area.
   About 130,000 people have already been evacuated from the
vicinity of the plant.

   An airline official said there was no connection
between the tail engine failure that forced a Continental Airlines
727 to abort a takeoff and recent tail engine problems in DC-10
jetliners.
   An official at Boeing Co., the aircraft's maker, said Sunday's
incident was ``very unusual,'' and added that the company would
want to investigate it.
   Fan blades and other metal pieces of the Pratt &amp; Whitney engine
on the Boeing 727-200 were scattered over a runway at Stapleton
International Airport after the plane's No. 2 engine disintegrated.
   No one was injured.
   The runway was closed for about 90 minutes and the 128
passengers on the plane bound for Portland were put on another
flight. There also were seven crew members aboard when the engine
failed.
   Ron Holthouser, a retired American Airlines pilot from Oakridge,
Ore., said he heard a loud mechanical scream and a pop from the
rear engine during the acceleration for liftoff.
   ``Luckily, it happened on the ground but it was nip and tuck
there,'' Holthouser said.
   ``He did the right thing,'' he said, referring to the pilot's
decision to abort takeoff. ``I give him all the credit in the
world. It was a snap judgment and they didn't have much runway
left.''
   The No. 2 engine is mounted in the fuselage. The 727 also has
two other engines mounted near the rear of the aircraft, and it can
take off with just two engines, although it is designed to take off
with all three, Continental spokesman Ned Walker said.
   The No. 2 engine has come under scrutiny recently in DC-10
aircraft, made by McDonnell Douglas, which are larger than 727s,
but Walker said there is ``no comparison whatsoever to the DC-10
question.''
   On July 19, a United Air Lines DC-10 bound for Chicago from
Denver crashed in an Iowa cornfield while attempting an emergency
landing at the Sioux City airport. Its tail engine exploded in
midflight, apparently severing hydraulic lines that control the
wing and tail flaps. The crash killed 111 people but 185 survived.
   Last week, a Northwest Airlines DC-10 made an emergency landing
in Denver on its way to Minneapolis from Los Angeles after its No.
2 tail engine apparently started disintegrating in flight, nicking
the hydraulic lines but not severing them.
   On Friday, a third DC-10 bound for Denver aborted takeoff in
Boston because of a stalled compressor in the tail-mounted engine,
officials said.
   Walker said engine pieces did not perforate the engine's outer
cover in Sunday's incident.
   Because there were no injuries reported and the engine failure
was contained inside the covering, Walker said an investigation by
federal authorities was not required.
   But Tom Cole, a Boeing spokesman in Seattle, said a contained
engine failure in a 727 was rare and investigators from the
company, the NTSB, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Continental would want to
examine the engine.
   ``It is very unusual to have an engine do that on a 727,'' Cole
said. ``I can't remember the last time it happened, if it actually
ever happened at all.''

<TEXT>
   Most of the 13 people on a
hot-air balloon that collided with another over the Australian
outback locked arms before plummeting 2,000 feet to their death,
authorities said.
   An aviation expert called Sunday's accident the worst ballooning
tragedy in the 206-year history of the sport.
   The victims were 11 Australians, an Italian and a Dane, police
said.
   All balloon flights around Alice Springs, a central Outback
town, were canceled while police and aviation authorities
investigated the crash.
   The accident occurred after the balloon, one of four on a
sightseeing trip, rose quickly under a second, struck it, then
started to shake, said Germany's Irene Fielder, who was on her
first balloon ride when she witnessed the accident.
   A hole the size of a bed sheet was torn in the cavernous red and
black striped canopy, according to another report.
   Authorities said three of the victims apparently tried to save
themselves by jumping out at the moment of impact. The other 10
were found huddled, arms linked, in the woven basket attached to
the canopy.
   The balloon plunged to the ground in about 30 seconds, said Mike
Crofts, who was in another balloon. ``They didn't stand a chance,''
he said.

<HEAD>GOP, Democrats Square Off in Race for Wright Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican received the highest number of votes
in a special election to replace Jim Wright in Congress, but the
top Democratic finisher predicted a victory in the runoff.
   Republican Bob Lanier received 21,978 ballots, or 39 percent of
the vote, in Saturday's special election for the 12th District seat
surrendered by Wright, but Democrat Pete Geren was elated with his
32 percent showing _ 17,751 votes.
   Geren, a Fort Worth attorney, got quick endorsements from both
Wright and from Democrat Jim Lane, who finished third in the race
and with 22 percent of the vote was the only other candidate to
garner more than 3 percent.
   A runoff is necessary because no one in the eight-candidate race
to replace Wright received a simple majority.
   Geren received a ringing endorsement from Wright, who resigned
the seat June 30 after an ethics investigation uncovered 69
instances of alleged house violations.
   ``I want to ask all of you to redouble your efforts because
here's a man I want to be my successor,'' Wright told supporters at
a victory party late Saturday. ``He is steeped in the traditions of
our state and country.''
   Wright first won election in 1955 and was re-elected 17 times in
the next 34 years. He received 88 write-in votes in the special
election, after telling constituents he was not interested in
trying to win back the seat.
   The elections administrator asked Gov. Bill Clements to schedule
the runoff for Sept. 9. The runoff must be called 20 to 30 days
after the state canvasses the votes, a process that probably will
be completed in a week.
   Meanwhile, Dallas voters approved by a 2-to-1 margin a proposal
to reorganize the structure of city council. The proposal received
41,456 votes to 20,823 against.
   The so-called ``10-4-1'' proposal called for expanding the
council from 11 members to 15, with 10 elected from single-member
districts, four from overlapping ``super districts'' and the mayor
elected citywide. Currently, eight members of council are elected
from single-member districts and three _ including the mayor _ are
elected at large.
   Proponents said the plan would give minorities a greater voice
in city government. Opponents said it would dilute minority voting
power. Others said the plan wouldn't substantially change the
ethnic makeup of council districts.
   And Dallas Area Rapid Transit officials won a significant battle
when voters in four of five Dallas suburbs decided to retain the
agency. About one-fifth of transit agency's sales tax income was
riding on the five suburban elections, as was the fate of a truly
regional transportation system.

   Members of the Christian Democratic Party
voted in Guatemala's first presidential primary and an unofficial
count indicated party chief Alfonso Cabrera was winning.
   Official results from Sunday's balloting were expected later
today.
   The election date has not been announced, but it is expected to
be late this year. President Vinicio Cerezo's five-year term
expires Jan. 14, 1991.
   Results gathered by the local Emisoras Unidas radio chain
indicated Cabrera, a congressman and former foreign minister under
Cerezo, was leading Rene de Leon Schlotter, a longtime party leader
and former Development Minister, and Cerezo's wife, Raquel Blandon
de Cerezo, who is a lawyer.
   Mrs. Cerezo, director of social welfare for the presidency, has
been active in the party but did not openly campaign for the
nomination.
   The president, a Christian Democrat, has backed Cabrera and
voted in Sunday's election.
   Turnout was estimated at about 120,000.
   Jorge Carpio Nicolle, founder of the National Union of the
Center, and Jorge Serrano Elias of the Joint Action Movement are
virtually assured their party's nominations. Carpio Nicolle
finished second against Cerezo in 1985 and Serrano third.
   Executive committees of the conservative National Renovation and
Revolutionary parties say they back Fernando Andrade, foreign
minister in the 1983-1986 military government of Gen. Oscar
Humberto Mejia Victores and former ambassador of Cerezo's
government to the United Nations. Party conventions must be held to
confirm the nomination.

   Space shuttle Columbia's astronauts
were tight-lipped after returning to Earth from a military mission
believed to include the deployment of a spy satellite and tests of
``Star Wars'' equipment.
   ``We had a great time,'' Air Force Col. Mark Brown said after
the Columbia glided to a pinpoint landing at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., early Sunday.
   Neither he nor the four other astronauts had much else to say
about the five-day, one-hour and 56-minute flight, the first for
NASA's oldest shuttle in more than 3{ years.
   The crew was resting today but will return to the Johnson Space
Center on Tuesday for briefings about the flight.
   The five astronauts and their wives returned home to Houston on
Sunday afternoon. They were greeted at Ellington Field by their
families and about 300 cheering friends and co-workers.
   ``It wasn't nice, it was fantastic,'' pilot Richard Richards, a
Navy commander and one of three space rookies on the flight, told
the crowd.
   ``Our mission went perfectly smooth,'' said Brown, a mission
specialist and another first-timer in space. ``The vehicle was
flawless.''
   A news blackout ordered by the Department of Defense prevailed
over the flight, and only a few brief announcements broke the
silence. Even the landing was closed to the public.
   The main goal of the mission was widely believed to be
deployment of a powerful, 10-ton spy satellite that can snap highly
detailed photographs of military installations, troop movements and
other targets around the world. Such a satellite would help the
United States verify Soviet compliance with arms treaties.
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice confirmed last week that the
astronauts had deployed a satellite several hours after blastoff
Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Fla., but he would not elaborate about
its purpose.
   The astronauts also were believed to have conducted ``Star
Wars'' experiments and to have performed tests aimed at determining
the feasibility of monitoring military sites from space.
   Columbia was commanded by Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, a
veteran of two previous shuttle flights. The crew also included
mission specialists Navy Cmdr. David Leestma, who flew one previous
flight, and Army Lt. Col. James Adamson.
   The orbiter sustained little damage to its protective tiles, and
no tiles appeared to be missing, said Ed Jenner, shuttle support
manager for the Air Force at Edwards.
   The flight was the first for Columbia since January 1986, when
the spaceship flew on a mission that landed just 10 days before the
Challenger explosion, which killed seven astronauts.
   Columbia had remained in the hangar while the two newer
shuttles, Discovery and Atlantis, made two trips each since manned
missions resumed last September. Columbia eventually was
overhauled, undergoing more than 250 modifications.
   The mission was the 30th shuttle flight overall. Three more
shuttle flights are planned this year and nine are scheduled in
1990.

   A single-engine plane carrying U.S.
Rep. Larkin Smith disappeared from radar screens and is believed to
have gone down in a forest, a spokesman said today.
   John Walker, spokesman for the Mississippi Republican, said
rescuers searched by air and on the ground south of Hattiesburg in
the DeSoto National Forest.
   ``He left Hattiesburg at 9:10 p.m. (Sunday) and went off radar
at 9:25 p.m.,'' Walker said.
   Billy Thornton, an assistant to Smith, said staff members were
optimistic that the freshman legislator and the pilot, both of
Gulfport, would be found alive.
   He said it would take several hours for anyone to walk out of
the rural area.
   Thornton also said search aircraft during the night reported no

   An FBI agent's boat caught fire offshore,
forcing seven people to abandon ship before several hundred rounds
of ammunition began to explode.
   No injuries were reported Sunday afternoon.
   A pleasure boat picked up the passengers from the water as the
39-foot vessel burned a mile offshore, said Los Angeles County
sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner
   A passenger, Kirsten Rascati, 16, said 500 rounds of ammunition
were kept on the boat by owner and FBI agent Stanley Los, 47, of
Santa Barbara.
   She said the passengers smelled smoke and put on their life
jackets.
   ``Then we saw smoke and flames that came from the pilot house,''
said Ms. Rascati. ``(Los) yelled, `Jump' and we all jumped into the
water. Another boat nearby rescued us.''
   Bullets heated by flames began exploding about five minutes
after the passengers abandoned ship.
   Exploding ammunition hampered firefighters, and the boat was
gutted, Wehner said.
   He said the cause of the fire was under investigation.
   ``Stanley explained that the trawler, a 39-foot, twin-engine
diesel fishing vessel, was also his residence and that he kept both
guns and ammo on the boat. It is not against the law,'' Wehner said.

<HEAD>Fish-Processing Ship Sinks Off Alaska; Crew Safe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KETCHIKAN, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 166-foot fish-processing ship
carrying up to 18,000 gallons of fuel sank off the coast, but all
68 people aboard were rescued, the Coast Guard said today.
   The ship began to list Saturday evening and by about 9 p.m., the
crew was evacuated to a fishing vessel that had been nearby, said
Coast Guard Petty Officer Greg Robinson. Four crew members were
treated at a hospital for minor injuries.
   The steel-hulled vessel went down in the Tongass Narrows, a
waterway off Ketchikan on Alaska's southern coast, with between
15,000 and 18,000 gallons of fuel, Robinson said. It was not
immediately known how much fuel had escaped.
   Oil slicks were sighted on both sides of Pennock Island, which
is directly across from Ketchikan, Robinson said. Divers reached
the ship Sunday in 144 feet of water, sealing fuel vents to prevent
further seepage of oil, he said.
   Fuel remaining on board will have to be removed, and authorities
were considering raising the boat, which was upright on the sea
floor, Robinson said.
   The cause of the sinking was not immediately known.
   The Coast Guard assumed control of the spill and hired a cleanup
contractor after the vessel's owner refused to contract with a
salvage services to contain any oil slick and to accept financial
responsibility, Robinson said.
   Coast Guard records showed Ocean Pacific Fisheries of Seattle
owned the vessel, but Yak Inc. of Seattle told the Coast Guard it
was the owner, Robinson said. It will be billed for the Coast
Guard's services, he added.
   There was no immediate estimate of cleanup costs. No one
answered the telephone at Yak Inc. on Sunday.

   The congressional seat left vacant by the death
of Democrat Mickey Leland in a plane crash in Ethiopia will be
filled in a special election.
   Gov. Bill Clements can choose the next ``uniform election
date,'' Nov. 7, for the election to fill the downtown Houston seat
Leland held since 1979, or he can declare an emergency and hold one
sooner, said Clements' press secretary.
   Wreckage of a plane carrying Leland and 15 others to a refugee
camp in Ethiopia was discovered Sunday on a mountainside 100 miles
from the traveling party's destination. Pentagon officials believe
there were no survivors.
   The 18th Congressional District is a varied area that includes
one of the city's poorest slums but also middle-income
neighborhoods.
   Some 70 percent of residents are either black or Hispanic.
   They have a tradition of voting solidly Democratic, electing
Barbara Jordan to office before turning to Leland when Ms. Jordan
decided to retire in 1978.
   The special election would be the second this year to fill a
Texas congressional seat. Balloting Saturday to choose a successor
to former House Speaker Jim Wright failed to produce a clear
winner, and a runoff will be held.

^Total Eclipse of Moon May be Seen by More Than a Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A total lunar eclipse visible from five
continents occurs after sunset Wednesday when the full moon orbits
into the shadow of the Earth and slowly turns from a bright silver
into a copper or orange disk.
   More than a billion people will have a chance to watch as the
moon appears to be slowly nibbled away, changing from the normal
bright reflected light of a full moon into the colorful glow of
eclipse.
   The celestial show starts at 8:23 p.m. EDT over the United
States and will end about 5{ hours later. The eastern United States
will get the best viewing and Alaska will miss the eclipse
altogether.
   Visible eclipse phases will vary for the central and western
parts of the country because of the difference in sunset and
moonrise. In Los Angeles, for instance, the eclipse will have
started before the sun has set or the moon has risen. By the time
the sky has darkened completely in California, the moon will
already be in the deepest part of its eclipse. For Seattle, the
moon will still be below the horizon at mid-eclipse, but will rise
during the totality phase.
   Clouds, of course, could ruin the viewing at any location.
   With clear skies, though, some phase of the celestial spectacle
should be visible to observers in North and South America, western
Europe and Africa, and the Antarctic. Sailors at sea in the
Atlantic and in the eastern Pacific Ocean also will be able to see
part of the eclipse, weather permitting.
   A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow
created by the Earth blocking the sun's light. The moon, in its
orbit of the Earth, usually passes above or below this shadowline,
but every few years it follows a path that puts it completely in
shade for a time. When the whole moon passes through the shadow, it
is called a total eclipse.
   The last total lunar eclipse visible over most of North America
occurred in December 1982, and the next one is not until December
1992.
   Astronomers are forecasting that Wednesday's eclipse may be a
bright one.
   The moon can appear during an eclipse to be a bright coppery red
if there is clear, clean air between the lunar surface and the
observer on Earth. If smoke or dust obscure the view, the moon will
diminish to an orange color or perhaps even fade from view
altogether.
   Volcanic eruptions historically have dimmed eclipse viewing by
dumping tons of dust into the atmosphere. But astronomers say
enough time has passed since the last major volcanic eruption that
most dust has settled.
   The eclipse starts when the moon enters what is called the
penumbra. This outer fringe of the Earth's shadow will show up on
the moon as a grayish shading. After about half an hour, the moon
will edge into the umbra, the dark, central part of the shadow.
Total eclipse, when all of the moon is covered by the umbra, will
begin at about 10:20 p.m. EDT and last for one hour, 36 minutes.
   When the moon leaves the umbra, the events will occur in reverse
order. The eclipse ends about 1:53 a.m. EDT when the moon edges out
of the shadow altogether.
   While a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth blocks sunlight from
the moon, a solar eclipse is caused when the moon blocks sunlight
from the Earth.
   To experts, a solar eclipse is more interesting because it
permits unique measurements of the sun.
   ``Solar eclipses attract a lot of scientific attention,'' said
John Bangert, a U.S. Naval Observatory astronomer in Washington.
``A lunar eclipse is just a good show.''
   Here is when the various phases of the eclipse will occur. All
times are Eastern daylight.
   Moon enters penumbra: 8:23 p.m.
   Moon enters umbra: 9:21 p.m.
   Moon enters totality: 10:20 p.m.
   Middle of Eclipse: 11:08 p.m.
   Moon leaves totality: 11:56 p.m.
   Moon leaves umbra: 12:56 a.m., Thursday.
   Moon leaves penumbra: 1:53 a.m.
   Because of the differences in sunset and moonrise times, viewing
will start at different eclipse phases in the western parts of the
country.
   Here are times for the local events that affect eclipse viewing.
The first hour is for local sunset and the second is for local
moonrise. The best viewing will follow twilight which ends about 25
minutes after sunset. Local time zones apply in all cases:
   Baltimore: Sunset at 8 p.m. Moonrise at 7:53 p.m.
   Boston: 7:43 p.m. and 7:36 p.m.
   Chicago: 7:49 p.m. and 7:43 p.m.
   Cleveland: 8:25 p.m. and 8:18 p.m.
   Houston: 8:01 p.m. and 7:55 p.m.
   Kansas City, Mo.: 8:12 p.m. and 8:06 p.m.
   Los Angeles: 7:39 p.m. and 7:35 p.m.
   Philadelphia: 7:56 p.m. and 7:48 p.m.
   Salt Lake City: 8:24 p.m. and 8:20 p.m.
   San Francisco: 8:01 p.m. and 7:58 p.m.
   Seattle: 8:20 p.m. and 8:16 p.m.
   St. Louis: 7:54 p.m. and 7:47 p.m.
   Washington: 8:01 p.m. and 7:54 p.m.

<HEAD>Khamenei Slams U.S. After Iran Makes New Offer on Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, said today that Iran will never hold talks with the
United States. Hours earlier, Iran renewed an offer to help free
Western hostages in Lebanon.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
reported in a commentary late Sunday that Tehran was ``ready to use
its maximum influence for the release of all hostages'' if the
United States freed Iranian assets worth billions of dollars it
froze 10 years ago.
   But Tehran Radio, also monitored in Cyprus, quoted Khamenei
today as saying no Iranian leader will negotiate with the United
States.
   ``Next to the usurper regime ruling over occupied Palestine, you
are the most cursed government in the eyes of the Iranian people.
No one in the Islamic republic will hold talks with you,'' the
radio quoted Khamenei as telling U.S. leaders.
   Khamenei has been seen as a so-called moderate in Iran,
interested in restoring the country's ties with the West. His
comments underlined the divisions in Tehran over whether Iran
should help free the Western hostages in Lebanon.
   ``In Lebanon, America commits the greatest atrocities and
encourages its puppet Israel in kidnapping and hostage-taking,''
Khamenei said, referring to Israel's abduction July 28 of Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem clergyman.
   Khamenei did not specifically mention the Westerners held
hostage. Most are held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem fundamentalists.
   Khamenei was elected Iran's religious leader to succeed
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3. At that time, he was
clearly allied with Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, the
leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists who favor rebuilding
bridges with the West.
   Rafsanjani, who was elected Iran's president, has made clear in
recent days that dialogue with the United States on freeing the
hostages is possible. He was behind the clandestine
arms-for-hostages deal with the United States in 1985-86, during
which three American hostages were freed.
   But Rafsanjani's radical rivals in Tehran, led by Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, have said they oppose any dealings
with the United States.
   U.S. and Western intelligence officials have said Mohtashemi was
closely linked with the formation of Hezbollah, the radical group
believed to be the umbrella for factions holding foreign hostages.
   The IRNA commentary Sunday said the United States must pressure
Israel to free Obeid and secure the release of three Iranians
missing in Lebanon since 1982 and all ``Lebanese captives held by
Israel.''
   The Israelis said they kidnapped Obeid to arrange a swap with
three Israeli servicemen held in Lebanon. They later widened the
offer to include the release of Western hostages.
   Hezbollah has ruled out any exchange of the Israeli prisoners
until Obeid is released.
   The Sunday Times of London reported Sunday that Israeli
investigators who have questioned Obeid believe two of the Israeli
soldiers are dead.
   Israel's chief army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ephraim Lapid, said he
refuses to accept that.
   ``My consideration is that they are alive and we must do our
utmost to bring them home,'' Lapid told a news conference Sunday.
   `We consider our prisoners of war ... as living until positive
evidence proves the contrary,'' Lapid said.
   The Sunday Times quoted unidentified senior Israeli government
sources as saying Obeid's interrogators believe two Israeli
infantrymen, Yousef Fink and Rahamim Alsheik, died of wounds within
hours after their car was ambushed in south Lebanon in February
1986.
   The hostages in Lebanon include eight Americans. The hostage
held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The IRNA commentary Sunday said ``the hostages are not held by
Iran'' but by ``unknown and underground groups.''
   It said that ``the influence Iran has on these groups is merely
spiritual, which in certain cases in the past has proved
effective.''

   Police fired plastic bullets at
rioting youths in mainly Roman Catholic west Belfast today, the
20th anniversary of the arrival of British troops in Northern
Ireland.
   A police spokesman said many of those involved in the
disturbances were young and he urged parents to keep their children
indoors.
   ``Their parents have a responsibility to keep them off the
streets and out of trouble,'' he said, speaking anonymously in
keeping with British custom.
   There were no reported injuries in disturbances that started
about 6:15 a.m., said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force.
   Two buses and a truck were hijacked and set on fire, said the
spokesman. Bus service to the area was cut off for two hours to
prevent more hijackings, he said.
   Chief Constable Hugh Annesley appealed Sunday for calm across
Northern Ireland during events today marking the day British troops
entered Londonderry two decades ago to separate rebellious
Catholics from charging police. Troops moved into Belfast a day
later.
   ``I would like to see parents keep their children in,'' said
Annesley. ``I would like community leaders, church leaders,
politicians of all persuasions, to encourage those in the community
from one side to the other to please keep calm, to avoid being
provoked and to let this very difficult time pass by.''
   Protestants marched Saturday in a parade in Londonderry to mark
the 300th anniversary of a defeat over the Catholic King James II,
and Catholics marched Sunday up the Falls Road in west Belfast.
   Republicans planned to gather in Londonderry tonight to march
through Waterloo Place where British soldiers first arrived at 5
p.m. on Aug. 14, 1969, after sectarian riots had engulfed the city
for two days and nights.
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of
the outlawed Irish Republican Army, told Sunday's marchers:
   ``We have a lot to be proud of because we have come a long way
in 20 years. Our opponents have failed to defeat us.''
   Adams praised the IRA as ``the real freedom fighters.''
   Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, a leader in the Catholic civil
rights marches of the 1960's, told the cheering crowd:
   ``The British army came in 19 and 69 not because we were being
attacked, but because for the first time since the beginning of
this state _ this misbegotten tuppence ha'penny bastardized state _
we were fighting back.''
   ``The reasons they are still here 20 years after is because we
are still fighting back,'' she said.
   Looking back over 20 years, Mrs. McAliskey complained that
Catholics still suffer more unemployment than Protestants, local
government was powerless and the rights of criminal defendants,
including the right to silence, have been eroded.
   ``Everything we got out of them we squeezed out of them,'' Mrs.
McAliskey said. ``Yet it was nothing, because every time we gained
something they clawed it back.''
   The thousands who marched up the Falls Road to Andersonstown on
Sunday represent only a minority within Northern Ireland's Roman
Catholic community. In election after election, Sinn Fein has
pulled about half as many votes as the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, which is committed to peaceful change.
   Security was strict along the parade route. Annesley, appointed
last year to head the Royal Ulster Constabulary, surprised Sinn
Fein by coming in person. Later, he complimented the organizers for
a well-run parade.
   On Saturday, Annesley's men discovered an IRA bomb in
Londonderry that exploded before it could be defused. No one was
injured but a building was destroyed.
   More than 2,700 people, two-thirds of them civilians, have died
in 20 years of violence in Northern Ireland, which is divided
between Catholics who generally favor a united Ireland, and
Protestants who support continued British rule.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Return to Campus for Political Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at two Beijing universities at the hub
of last spring's pro-democracy movement returned to their campuses
today for mandatory political education before resuming regular
studies.
   The campuses of Qinghua University and the China People's
University bustled with students rushing to classes and picking up
old friendships.
   However, there were no overt signs of the activism of April and
May, when students boycotted classes to press their demands for
more democratic government.
   The student activists were at the center of a movement that
confronted the ruling Communist Party with its demands for more
democracy. Authorities finally put down the protests in June,
killing at least 200 people and carrying out a nationwide wave of
arrests.
   Since then, officials have taken additional measures to gain
control over the unruly student population.
   Officials at Beijing University said first-year students at that
school would be required to undergo a year of military training and
``cultural studies'' before beginning their academic work.
Previously, they were required to take only two weeks of military
training.
   Universities throughout China have reinstated political
education, which was largely ignored in recent years, in an effort
to prevent more student unrest.
   Most students went home for summer vacation in June, but
graduating seniors were required to take several weeks of political
education and write essays of ``self-criticism'' before receiving
their diplomas.
   The political crackdown and arrests have had a tangible impact
on the universities, which buzzed with political broadcasts and
discussions last spring.
   Pro-democracy posters plastered on dormitories have been scraped
off. Bulletin boards now carry a few ads and class announcements.
   During a boycott of classes last spring, students often gathered
to discuss the pro-democracy movement.
   Today, the few students who lingered outside their dorms were
subdued and cautious. ``Everything's just fine here,'' one young
woman. ``No problems.''
   Upperclassmen at most universities in Beijing will return to
campus by early September, and freshman students will begin their
studies about a month later.
   Beijing colleges that led the student movement have had their
freshman enrollments cut by half or more in a move linked to the
protests. Nationwide, the number of first-year students has been
cut by 30,000 to 610,000.
   Officials have arrested at least seven of 21 Beijing University
students sought for involvement in the spring protests. At least
two have fled the country.

<HEAD>Weather Frustrates American Paraplegic Who Wants to Swim Channel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FOLKESTONE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American said today he'll go home
later this week unless the weather improves and allows him to make
an attempt to become the first paraplegic to swim the English
Channel.
   Robert Patterson, of Maryland, N.Y., has been waiting at a
Folkestone hotel for one week to attempt the 20-mile crossing from
England to Cap Gris Nez, France.
   ``I just can't believe that this is happening,'' he said today
of the weather. ``I trained for this for two years. I put my heart
and soul into it.''
   Winds in the channel today were 20 mph and waves were three to
five feet high. The conditions were ``much too rough'' for
swimmers, said Ray Scott, chairman of the Channel Swimming
Association that authenticates the swims.
   ``It's a conspiracy of the fates,'' Scott said. ``But it's no
use swimming in high winds. You get buffeted about in high waves.''
   Weather forecasts were boding early improvement, Scott said.
   Patterson said if he can't swim Tuesday or Wednesday, he will
return home.
   ``I can't get any more demoralized than I am now,'' he said.
``It was excellent weather most of the summer, so this is kind of a
shock.''
   Patterson, 33, became a paraplegic three years ago when he fell
25 feet from a scaffold on a construction site. The accident broke
his spine and paralyzed him from the waist down.
   He swam eight miles across Otsego Lake in upstate New York last
year in six hours, 48 minutes. This June, he swam the lake again,
going nine miles while shaving one hour, two minutes off his time.
   Patterson's training includes weightlifting in the fall and
winter and swimming in the St. Lawrence River on weekends in the
summer. He also takes daily swims in an indoor pool or a local lake.
   Two other paraplegics have attempted to swim the English Channel
but failed.
   Patterson said if thwarted by the weather this time, he doubts
he'll come back for another attempt.
   A 27-year-old woman trying to become the first handicapped woman
to swim the channel is also waiting for the weather to improve,
Scott said.
   Lucyna Krajewska, who has had both legs amputated, attempted the
crossing in 1987 but gave up after covering only six miles in seven
hours.
   Ms. Krajewska, who was born in Poland, defected to West Germany
six years ago. She won the gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle
swim at the Paraolympics in Seoul last year.

   One of the most widely used psychological
tests in the world has undergone a personality change after about
50 years.
   The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, administered
millions of times a year to job applicants and others, has been
updated to reflect 1980s attitudes and ailments.
   For instance, it no longer asks test subjects if they enjoyed
reading ``Alice in Wonderland.'' The test has also done away with
male pronouns in questions pertaining to both sexes, no longer
assuming, for example, that political candidates are male in a
question about voting habits.
   Among questions removed were those about religion, sexual
preference and bodily functions such as excretion. Several
references that researchers thought were anachronisms were deleted,
such as one to the children's game ``Drop the Handkerchief.''
   ``Some of the questions were objectionable and some were out of
date,'' said James Butcher, a psychology professor at the
University of Minnesota who helped revise the test. ``My
conclusions were that it was basically a very sound instrument, but
it could be improved.''
   About 100 items have been added, designed to pinpoint such
modern problems as ``Type A'' achievement-oriented behavior, drug
abuse and attitudes about mental health treatment. Researchers
turned to alcohol treatment centers, mental health programs and
personnel settings to get a read on contemporary issues.
   The original test of 556 true-false statements was questioned by
critics because it used as a basis for normal personality the
answers from a sample group of about 700 rural Minnesotans,
averaging 35 years old with eighth-grade educations.
   Butcher last week said the revised sample is four times that
size and covers various ethnic, economic and geographic groups from
seven regions around the country.
   ``We've tried to make the test more applicable to today's
problems,'' he said. The revision is designed to be ``more user
friendly and of similar validity as the original test.''
   The test was developed at the University of Minnesota in the
1930s and 1940s by psychologist Starke R. Hathaway and psychiatrist
J. Charnley McKinley.
   They compared a sample group with a group of patients diagnosed
with problems including paranoia, schizophrenia, depression and
obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Results were intended to reveal
social and personal maladjustment.
   The test is used in more than 100 countries in scores of
translations, Butcher said. Originally used primarily in clinical
settings, it has spread to personnel, military and research
applications.
   Sample true-false questions include: ``I do not tire quickly,''
``I am worried about sex'' and ``I believe I am being plotted
against.''
   The seven-year revision was completed by Butcher and psychology
professors Auke Tellegen, also of the University of Minnesota, John
R. Graham of Kent State University and W. Grant Dahlstrom of the
University of North Carolina.
   The revised test is similar to the original, with test subjects
answering 567 questions on their feelings, symptoms, attitudes and
beliefs.
   Only licensed psychologists are authorized to buy the test,
whose rights are owned by the University of Minnesota Press.
   ``Anybody who can count can score it, but it takes expertise to
interpret it,'' Butcher said.

   A woman was beaten and stabbed to death in her
apartment as neighbors listened to her screams without going to
help, police said.
   Ruth Velez, 39, was repeatedly stabbed in the abdomen with her
own kitchen knife and beaten on the head, police said. No one
called the police emergency number until 11 p.m. Saturday, an hour
after the screams were first heard.
   ``Someone should have done something sooner,'' said Stella
Schectman, the owner of the three-family house in a comfortable,
middle-class section of Brooklyn.
   A neighbor who finally went to the victim's second-floor
apartment an hour after the violence began found Velez, a computer
programmer, dead amid a clutter of smashed furniture and overturned
house plants. Police said the assailant may have been a robber, and
they were questioning several people.
   Schectman said she returned from an errand in the middle of the
attack to find several neighbors gathered in the street.
   ``They said there was a lot of screaming coming from Ruth's
apartment. So I asked, why didn't someone go knock on her door? But
they were afraid,'' she said.
   Schectman then went to her apartment, separated by a thin wall
from Velez's, and watched television.
   ``I heard noises and heavy footsteps from Ruth's apartment. She
never had men in her apartment, but I knew she wasn't alone. Then
it was quiet,'' Schectman said.

<HEAD>Park Service Won't Salvage Ellis Island Ferry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Park Service has decided
against raising the sunken ferry Ellis Island, which carried 12
million immigrants to new lives.
   The Park Service can't afford the estimated $250,000 it would
cost to raise the 160-foot ferry, which rests under 14 feet of
water on Ellis Island, said spokeswoman Edie Shean-Hammond.
   The government may eventually try to bring up pieces of the
85-year-old boat, which sank at the former immigration station in
1968, she said.
   Officials said earlier that they would have to move the wreck
because it might interfere with boat traffic when a museum opens on
Ellis Island next year. But they have decided to work around the
boat, Ms. Shean-Hammond said.
   A Navy salvage unit decided in June that the boat's iron hull
was too weak to withstand the stress of being raised.
   The Ellis Island ferried immigrants and government workers
between the island and the mainland. The boat was moored at the
island after the immigration station closed in 1954.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria reportedly massed its troops and
armor in mountains overlooking this battered city today during
renewed shelling duels, stirring fears of another ground assault on
Christian areas.
   The fighting came a day after the Christian forces of Gen.
Michel Aoun repelled a ground attack on Souk el-Garb, a mountain
stronghold outside Beirut. It was the first ground assault in five
months of fierce artillery and rocket exchanges between Christian
forces and Syrian troops allied with Druse militias.
   Police reported three people killed and 12 wounded in today's
renewed shelling exchanges between Aoun's forces and the Syrian
army.
   The new casualties raised the overall death toll since fighting
broke out March 8 to 736 killed and 1,896 wounded by police count.
At least 37 civilians were killed and 120 wounded during shelling
between midnight Saturday and midnight Sunday.
   Police said the hilltop presidential palace, where Aoun has an
underground headquarters bunker, was repeatedly hit today by Syrian
mortar and rocket fire. But a police spokesman said there were no
casualties and that Aoun and his aides were safe.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified in keeping with
regulations, said the Syrians were massing troops and armor in a
central mountain near Douar, 11 miles northeast of Souk el-Gharb.
   ``They're bringing in T-62 tanks and dozens of mortars of
various calibers to positions overlooking Douar,'' he said.
   Douar is a major Christian military position beside the main
road through the mountains from the Syrian-held Bekaa Valley in
east Lebanon.
   Today's movements triggered fears the Syrians were planning a
new attempt to punch into the Christian enclave.
   Souk el-Gharb, which lies 15 miles southeast of Beirut, was
again hit by Syrian shellfire today.
   Police said 25 Syrians, 20 Druse militiamen and 25 Palestinians
were killed Sunday in the Souk el-Gharb fighting and in skirmishes
along Beirut's dividing Green Line. The Lebanese Army said four of
its men were killed and six wounded. They were no immediate reports
of casualties today.
   Aoun's aides said his forces were bracing for another assault.
   ``We're ready to take them on again,'' an Aoun aide said as
mortar and tank fire hit the town, abandoned by civilians six years
ago.
   The mountaintop garrison, under siege by Syrian-backed Moslem
forces since 1983, controls a network of roads that twist through
Lebanon's central range into the Christian heartland.
   If Souk el-Gharb fell, it would leave the way open for a Syrian
ground offensive into the beleaguered Christian sector.
   Aoun said his U.S.-trained 8th Brigade, reinforced by the 10th
Commando Brigade, repulsed a four-pronged attack on Souk el-Gharb
Sunday by 2,100 Syrian regulars, Palestinian guerrillas of the
radical Syrian-backed Fatah-Uprising faction and the Druse
Progressive Socialist Party militia.
   Aoun, the army commander and leader of a Christian Cabinet,
controls an estimated 20,000 troops opposed by about 40,000 Syrian
regulars and their Moslem militia allies. Aoun is also backed by
the 6,000-member right-wing Lebanese Forces, the main Chrisitan
militia.
   The recent fighting is the latest round in a 14-year-old civil
war.
   Today's bombardment began sporadically around dawn and
intensified by midday into sustained barrages on Christian east
Beirut and north along the coast. Aoun's artillery retaliated by
opening up on Syrian gun positions in west Beirut.
   A Syrian militiary spokesman in Damascus denied that any Syrian
forces were involved in Sunday's fighting at Souk el-Gharb.
   Syria's military headquarters in Lebanon said in a statement
that ``nationalist forces'' allies to Syria mounted the assault.
   The Druse party claimed its men staged a ``hit-and-run attack''
on the Christian base.
   But Aoun's headquarters said the Syrians threw most of their
41st Brigade into the combined assault with the Moslem irregulars.
   ``They suffered a resounding defeat,'' Aoun said in a victory
speech broadcast by Christian radio stations Sunday.
   Both sides have been locked in heavy artillery duels since
Thursday, firing hundreds of thousands of shells and rockets that
have devastated much of Beirut.
   Rescue teams used an overnight lull to remove civilians trapped
in wrecked buildings. Hundreds of cars smoldered in streets
littered with broken glass and rubble. The acrid smoke from scores
of apartment buildings that burned all night wafted through the
alleyways.
   Dazed residents cautiously emerged from their shelters after
some had been underground for four days. Long lines formed outside
the few bakeries that opened. Sandbagged supermarkets were crowded.
   An estimated 85 percent of Beirut's 1.5 million people have fled
in recent weeks as the fighting intensified.
   Syria's troops are in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. Aoun maintains they betrayed that mandate
when they sided the Moslems in the war.
   Syria refuses to negotiate with Aoun, who has vowed to drive the
Syrians out of Lebanon.

   They came to hear ``Exile on Main
Street.'' They wound up exiled on York Street.
   The Rolling Stones were inside Toad's Place, opening their 1989
tour with an unannounced gig at the small Connecticut club. But the
Saturday night show, a mere rumor at 6 p.m., was sold out in two
hours; one solid block of York Street was jammed with hopefuls who
never got inside.
   Which didn't bother Andy Broughal, 21, who paid a $3 cover and
did.
   ``Great. Exciting. Unbelievable. Phenomenal. The blues at its
best,'' Broughal exulted. He was about 15 feet from the stage when
Mick, Keith and the rest of the band played their first U.S. show
in eight years.
   ``Thank you. Good, good, good. We've been playing for ourselves
the last six weeks,'' Jagger told the screaming crowd _ a reference
to the band's stay at the Wykeham Rise School, a vacant girls'
school in rural Washington, Conn.
   While the Stones were the stars Saturday night, everybody inside
the club was eager to grab their own bit of the spotlight with
stories detailing assorted leaks about the ``secret concert.''
   Broughal got a phone call at 6:50 p.m. Saturday from a buddy who
heard the buzz near the club. A 50-ish woman came with her tuxedoed
husband, who worked security at Wykeham, for their first-ever
Stones show. Another guy spotted the club's owner at a local liquor
store buying Rebel Yell, Keith Richards' whiskey of choice, and
quickly called friends.
   Jane Prins, 30, got her tip from a friend of a friend of the
Stones' masseuse. On very short notice, she dropped her two kids
off with her mother and headed out with a friend.
   ``I said, `Mom, you have to do this.' My mother has no
conception of music, but she knows the Rolling Stones,'' Prins said.
   Once confirmed, the word spread quickly: the Stones really were
coming. The crowd ignored the sign outside announcing, ``Tonight.
Rock Dance Party with the Cruiser. Admission $3.01.'' By 8 p.m.,
the doors were closed.
   ``It's happening, man. They're here,'' said one depressed fan
wearing a Bill The Cat T-shirt. Another offered $20 to anyone on
the guest list who could smuggle him in, but he found no takers.
Still more looked for unattended doors behind the club, hoping to
slip in.
   Inside, the crowd was a curious mix of New York chic and Ivy
League prep. Yalies in sweatshirts rubbed shoulders with black-clad
Manhattanites, who appeared stunned by the ways of suburban club
life.
   ``You've got to PAY for drinks?'' asked one incredulous
scene-maker, his eyes growing large behind tinted shades, after
picking up his rum and coke.
   Why New Haven? ``It's like a thank you to their fans up here, I
guess,'' explained harried Stones tour publicist Lynn Tanzman. The
decision was also made at the last minute: Toad's co-owner Brian
Phelps said he was called Friday about the Saturday show, setting
off a whirlwind 24 hours.
   The important stuff: set list. Eleven songs, 56 minutes. ``Start
Me Up,'' ``Bitch,'' ``Tumbling Dice,'' ``Sad, Sad, Sad'' (new
album), ``Miss You,'' ``Little Red Rooster,'' ``Honky Tonk Women,''
``Mixed Emotions'' (new single), ``It's Only Rock and Roll,''
``Brown Sugar,'' ``Jumpin' Jack Flash.''
   While getting close enough to eyeball Mick's lips or choke on
Keith's cigarette smoke thrilled most, not everyone enjoyed the
show. New Haven Police Officer ``I'm not authorized to speak''
Bicki stood resolutely by, hand on walkie-talkie, as Keith and
Woody cranked out ``Start Me Up.''
   Once the show ended, things quickly reverted to normal. Bouncers
asked for two forms of ID, not if you were on the guest list. The
piped-in music was back on, Charlie Watts' drum kit taken down. The
block-long line outside Toad's was gone.
   Owner Phelps, after the biggest night in his club's 14-year
history, had just one regret.
   ``I never met 'em. At one point, I was downstairs with 'em
before the show, but they were into their own thing,'' he said.
``And 10 minutes after the show, they were gone.''

   Russian workers in Estonia kept up their 6-day-old
strike today, and workers at six factories in the southwestern
republic of Azerbaijan reportedly walked out to support demands of
a new nationalist group.
   In a third Soviet area threatened by nationalist strikes, the
Caucasus mountain republic of Georgia, activists said they will
decide at a mass meeting tonight whether to call a walkout for
Tuesday.
   In Estonia's Baltic Sea capital of Tallinn, strike leaders said
today at least 20,000 Russian workers stayed off the job to protest
a new law that tightens residency requirements for voters and
candidates.
   ``The strike is continuing,'' said strike committee member
Alexei Kutenyov in a telephone interview. He said the committee
expected decisive action on the stoppage from a Kremlin commission
on inter-ethnic affairs by Tuesday, but he did not elaborate.
   State-run Moscow Radio said today the Estonian strike has caused
losses of millions of dollars.
   It said the Estonian law will take the right to vote away from
more than 100,000 non-Estonians in the republic of 1.6 million.
   The new law limits voting to residents who have lived in the
same district for two years or anywhere in Estonia for five years.
Candidates must live in the same place for five years or in Estonia
for 10 years.
   In Azerbaijan, a local journalist reported workers walked out in
the late afternoon at six factories, including a steel plant, in
the capital of Baku.
   Of Baku's estimated 1 million workers, only about 1 percent
joined the stoppage, said Saveli Peretz, deputy chief of
Azerinform, the official Azerbaijani news agency.
   Speaking by telephone, he said the strike call, which was put
forth by the newly formed People's Front of Azerbaijan, would
probably be discussed at a mass meeting in Baku late today.
   The strike was meant to support demands that local leaders
``find political solutions instead of military ones'' to the
republic's ethnic violence, which has caused dozens of deaths, said
activist Aidin Amirbekov in a telephone interview Sunday.
   Some activists in Azerbaijan are also demanding removal of
Soviet troops from the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and
an end to curfews in the republic, but Amirbekov said authorities
consider relations too tense to take such a step.
   Troops reportedly have been halting clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh
on almost a daily basis.
   Traditionally Shiite Moslem Azerbaijan has been embroiled in a
dispute with neighboring Armenia, whose population is mainly
Christian, over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan but its population is
predominantly Armenian, and Armenia wants to annex it.
   In Estonia, Kutenyov said work had at least partially halted at
46 of the republic's enterprises, mainly in Tallinn and in the
mining town of Kohtla-Jarve. The labor newspaper Trud said Sunday
39 factories were involved in the strike.
   Estonian journalists said today some of the bus lines in Tallinn
were not running. ``That's the most acute thing for us,'' said
Estonian Radio commentator Harry Tiido in a telephone interview.
   Cargo railcars were piling up at Tallinn stations because train
workers were on strike, and the state airline Aeroflot was carrying
only emergency supplies and passengers there, Trud said.
   The strikers, most of whom work in industrial plants, also
object to a new national decision to give Estonia free rein over
its economy. The workers are demanding factories with a
predominantly Russian-speaking labor force remain under supervision
of the national government rather than be handed over to Estonia.

<TEXT>
   The West German government closed its
embassy in Budapest today to stop a flood of East Germans hoping to
go West. About 100 would-be emigrants were locked outside, but 181
occupying the embassy were allowed to remain inside.
   The Foreign Ministry announced Sunday the embassy would be
closed because its ability to assist the stream of East German
refugees was ``totally exhausted.''
   In Bonn, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher told
reporters those inside the embassy were being cared for by the
diplomatic staff and that Red Cross volunteers were erecting
temporary facilities outside the mission for new arrivals.
   Hungary's foreign minister, Gyula Horn, met today with Juergen
Suedhoff of the Bonn Foreign Ministry for talks focusing on the
situation, said Hungary's official MTI news agency.
   Talks dealt with ``the possible humanitarian solutions'' to the
problem, MTI reported without elaboration.
   Many of those at the embassy in Budapest are East Germans who
were caught trying to reach the West illegally. They are seeking
West German assistance out of fear they will be punished if they
return home.
   Schumacher said 141 adults and 40 children were inside the
compound. He said news reports estimating the number at up to 300
were exaggerated.
   More East Germans are thought to be sheltered in buildings
rented by West Germans.
   West German embassies in other East bloc capitals also have been
deluged by East Germans hoping to emigrate and fearing punishment
if they return home, despite East German assurances they will not
be punished.
   Bonn closed its East Berlin mission on Tuesday, after 131 East
Germans sought refuge there, and West German officials have said it
will not be opened again until normal operations can resume.
   About 20 East Germans were believed to have sought refuge at the
West German diplomatic mission in Prague, Czechoslovakia, but there
were no indications the Bonn government had any plans to close that
facility.
   The crush in Hungary began after that Soviet bloc nation began
dismantling barriers along its Western frontier with neutral
Austria.
   It is estimated at least 1,500 East Germans managed to make
their way to West Germay by going first to Hungary and then
crossing through Austria.
   Many were caught by Hungarian border guards as they tried to get
to Austria, and some took refuge in the West German compound.
   West Germany as a standard practice grants asylum to East
Germans, but West German Foreign Ministry officials have said that
only East Germany can grant the refugees exit visas. Applications
to emigrate often take years to process.
   Dozens of mostly young East Germans spent the night in front of
the Budapest compound despite the announcement the embassy would be
closed. Their numbers had swollen to about 100 by midday, when the
doors closed.
   West Germany expects about 100,000 East Germans to make their
way to West Germany by the end of the year through legal emigration
and escapes.
   Hungarian-language radio today reported that 471 East Germans
were caught trying to escape to Austria over the weekend from
Hungary.
   A Hamburg-based newspaper, The World on Sunday, said the West
German intelligence service has determined that 1.5 million East
Germans out of the population of 16 million want to emigrate to the
West.
   Hungary and Poland have followed the Soviet Union in
implementing political and economic reforms with greater individual
freedoms.
   But East German leader Erich Honecker has not wavered from his
hard-line policies.

<HEAD>Justice Postpones Order to Replace Louisiana Governing Boards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice today temporarily
freed Louisiana officials from having to replace four governing
boards with one to help racially desegregate the state's 17 public
colleges and universities.
   Justice Byron R. White, acting on emergency requests from the
Southern University Board of Supervisors and state Attorney General
William Guste, postponed the effect of a ruling that the
four-governing-boards system is a ``vestige'' of segregation that
must be eliminated.
   White was told that the Southern University board, under a
three-judge federal court's order, would cease to exist by Aug. 19
if he did not help.
   White's order stays the elimination of the Southern board until
the full Supreme Court receives a response by Justice Department
lawyers to the emergency requests filed by the Southern board and
Guste. The order did not impose a deadline for that response.
   Southern is Louisiana's largest predominantly black college,
with 13,000 students attending its three undergraduate campuses and
law school in Baton Rouge.
   Southern's board of supervisors, with 13 black members and four
white members, is one of four boards governing higher education in
the state.
   One board governs the Louisiana State University system, another
governs the mostly black Southern University system and a third
oversees all others. Those three boards answer to the State Board
of Trustees for Higher Education.
   ``The present scheme ... has perpetuated illegal segregation in
Louisiana's higher education,'' the three-judge court ruled in a
case begun in 1974 when Justice Department officials sued in behalf
of black students.
   The lower court's ruling last month would create a single
governing board, restrict admissions as some universities, limit
degree programs most can offer and establish a community college
system.
   The three-judge court ordered designation of LSU as the unified
system's flagship school, with the greatest number of graduate and
research programs and the strictist admissions requirements.
   It also called for creation of an intermediate level of four
institutions, including Southern, to offer significant doctoral and
other graduate programs, and for gradually merging the LSU and
Southern law schools.
   Eight other schools, including the predominantly black Grambling
State University, would be designated as a third tier and limited
to offering undergraduate degrees.
   Four colleges would become part of the new community college
system.
   State Sen. William Jefferson, a black New Orleans lawyer who
filed the emergency request on behalf of the Southern board, said
last month that the merger of the Southern and LSU law schools ``is
a real big problem for the board and for the black community.''
   More than 90 percent of Louisiana's black lawyers are graduates
of the Southern University law school.
   Guste's emergency request to White contended that any current
racial segregation among Louisiana's colleges and universities is
the result of student preferences and not any action or inaction by
state officials.
   ``Past constitutional infirmities of 20 years ago that have long
since been ameliorated does not justify judicial usurpation of the
inherently sensitive realm of higher educational policy,'' Guste
argued.
   The cases are Southern U. vs. U.S., A-126, and Guste vs. U.S.,
A-127.

   Bad weather today forced rescue
teams to postpone efforts to recover the bodies of Rep. Mickey
Leland and 15 others who died when their plane slammed into a
remote southwestern mountain.
   Heavy clouds and rain twice forced two Blackhawk helicopters
with U.S. and Ethiopian personnel to return to the capital before
the weather cleared enough for them to make the 250-mile flight to
the crash site by midafternoon.
   However, it was too late to begin full-scale recovery operations
by then, said James Haley, chief spokesman for the U.S. Embassy.
   ``We've got people down there and have started taking the
necessary photographs,'' said Haley. ``But we won't begin
retrieving bodies until tomorrow.''
   The bodies of 12 victims, including the Texas Democrat, were
found Sunday in the wreckage of the twin-engine plane, which
disappeared Aug. 7 on a flight to a refugee camp near the Sudanese
border.
   Three others who had been on board were presumed dead in the
crash that one U.S. Air Force pilot described as ``awesome,
unsurvivable.'' Workers were searching for the missing bodies in a
ravine below a jagged cliff at the crash site west-southwest of the
capital.
   ``The nose of the plane just ran into rocks,'' said Rep. Gary
Ackerman, D-N.Y., who was in the helicopter that first spotted the
wreckage of his colleague, who was chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger.
   ``The wings sheared off, and the engine and fuselage were
burned,'' Ackerman said after returning to Washington late Sunday.
   The cause of the crash was not known, but the weather was cloudy
and visibility was poor when Leland and his party left Addis Ababa.
Bad weather had delayed their takeoff by two hours.
   Flags were lowered to half-staff at the White House while
President Bush and other leaders expressed sorrow at the death of
Leland, who was en route to inspect conditions of 300,000 Sudanese
civil war refugees at a camp in Fugnido, about 100 miles southwest
of the crash site.
   The Twin Otter aircraft, owned by Ethiopia's relief agency,
crashed 4,300 feet up the side of the 5,500-foot mountain.
   The bodies were to be flown to nearby Dembidola and then ferried
by a C-130 cargo plane to the capital.
   Haley said the two Blackhawk helicopters would stay overnight at
Gambela, about 34 miles southeast of the crash site and begin
salvaging efforts at daybreak. They were expected to be joined by
two more Blackhawk helicopters carrying additional rescue crews in
the morning.
   About 100 recovery personnel were sent to the site today.
   Two C-130s carrying helicopter fuel also will leave for the site
at first light, said Haley.
   The bodies of the Americans were expected to be flown back to
the United States later this week aboard a C-141 hospital plane,
according to an administration official in Washington.
   Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Stan Bloyer said in Washingon that
Leland's plane did not appear to be attempting an emergency landing
when it crashed. He said it ``basically disintegrated'' after
hitting the side of the mountain, apparently at cruise speed.
   The wreckage was in terrain so rugged that medical teams,
including two doctors, had to be initially lowered to the site from
helicopters, said Haley.
   The bodies of the nine Americans were to be flown home via
Torrejon Air Base outside Madrid, Spain. Seven Ethiopians were also
on board.
   Leland's party consisted of two staff members; an aide to Rep.
Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif.; a friend of the congressman; three
officers of the U.S. Agency for International Development; and the
wife of one AID official. The Ethiopians included a U.S. Embassy
employee, three government officials and a crew of three.
   Mourned as a fighter for the homeless and hungry worldwide,
Leland was a six-term representative from Houston who began his
political career as a firebrand militant but won the respect of
both liberals and conservatives.
   Bush said in a statement from the White House, ``Mickey Leland
and the other members of his traveling party, both Americans and
Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the
hungry.''
   Leland often said his commitment to ending hunger was rooted in
a trip he made to Sudan in 1984, when a starving young girl died
before his eyes at a refugee camp. ``Every day I see her face,'' he
told reporters.
   The trip that ended with his death was his second there since
March; he visited Ethiopia and Sudan six times in the 10 years he
served in Congress. He was elected to fill the seat vacated by
Barbara Jordan when she retired.
   In Houston, friends and colleagues of Leland streamed into his
office as news spread the wreckage had been discovered.
   Rep. Mike Andrews, a Houston Democrat, said in a breaking voice,
``This is a very difficult time for Houston. We have lost one of
our most important leaders, and I've lost a very good friend.''
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements must decide whether to call a special
election in November or sooner to fill the downtown Houston
district seat Leland held.

   Passersby near the state Capitol complained to police Sunday

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. got a jump on
the school year today with the launch of its commercial-free news
show for use in the classroom.
   The producers of the program, CNN Newsroom, which made its debut
today, say they want to give principals and teachers a chance to
review the daily news program and decide if it fits their class
plans.
   There's another reason for getting an early start _ it gives Ted
Turner's Cable News Network a jump on the advertiser-supported
Channel One news service that Whittle Communications plans to offer
starting in March.
   ``School might not start until the first of September, but
teachers are already planning the fall semester,'' said Paul Amos,
an executive vice president at CNN. ``If they like it, they can put
the program on beginning day one of the school year for students.''
   CNN plans to carry the 15-minute shows without commercials at
3:45 a.m. EDT each weekday so that teachers may tape them and
replay all or parts of them in the classroom later in the day.
   The first show featured the day's headlines, including a report
on Rep. Mickey Leland, the Texas Democrat killed in a plane crash
in Ethiopia, and feature stories on a Georgia high school teacher
who publishes a folklore magazine, China's new student
indoctrination program and a weekend rock concert in Moscow.
   Along with the news shows, Turner is making a teacher's guide
available via computer mail to suggest ways the program can be used
to inspire discussions or research.
   The Channel One service, which runs 12 minutes a day with two
minutes of commercials, was tested for seven weeks last spring in
six middle and high schools. While the shows were generally
well-received by teachers and students in the test, several
national educational groups protested vehemently against giving
advertisers a vehicle for pitching products in the classroom.
   Officials in New York and California have banned Channel One
from their schools because of the commercials.
   Turner had planned to include public service-type commercials on
CNN Newsroom but decided to exclude advertising altogether and pick
up the seven-figure tab himself after hearing some eleventh-hour
complaints from educators.
   Channel One is planning to make massive donations to schools of
television monitors, satellite dishes and videocassette recorders
along with programming.
   It hopes to have 1,000 schools hooked up by launch date in March
and 8,000 by the fall of 1990.
   Turner is not donating TV monitors or recorders, but has
encouraged the cable systems that carry the program to provide free
hookups to schools and donations of VCRs or television sets where
needed.
   CNN's Amos said he expects 1,000 schools will make use of the
CNN Newsroom program when schools open this fall.
   Two other cable networks also are planning special programs for
the classroom; neither will carry ads.
   C-Span, the cable network that carries congressional sessions,
plans to run a student-oriented 10-minute program on a single
subject every week starting Aug. 22.
   The Discovery Channel will offer a daily one-hour show for the
classroom starting Sept. 18 with programming in areas such as
science, social studies and world events.

   As many as 47,000 nurses' aides, pharmacists and
other workers began a three-day strike today at 53 private
hospitals and nursing homes in the New York City area to press for
a raise.
   The strike by Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care
Employees Union began at 7 a.m., according to spokesman Bill Batson.
   The union's members have been working without a contract since
June 30 at the hospitals and nursing homes belonging to the League
of Voluntary Hospitals.
   ``Things are going fine,'' said Steven Alschuler, a spokesman
for the league. ``It's not going to impact patient care in any
serious way.''
   Management employees filled in for strikers. Batson said some
clinics were closed for the duration of the walkout, and some
elective surgery has been postponed.
   The striking union members include nurses' aides, pharmacists,
social and clerical workers, cooks, housekeepers and lab and X-ray
technicians.
   The union is seeking raises of 8.5 percent in each of the next
two years; the hospitals have offered 13 percent over three years.
   No talks were scheduled.

<HEAD>Kidnappers Release Hostages, Flee in Plane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four heavily armed fugitives who led police on a 10-day chase through
Brazil freed three hostages
and flew to Paraguay in a plane provided by authorities, local media reported
today.
   Brazil's O Globo newspaper said police in the Paraguayan city of Ciudad
del Este arrested two men after the fugitives' plane
landed at Hernandario airport, about 20 miles from the border. The men
were not identified.
   Neither Paraguayan officials nor Brazil's Air Force Ministry could
immediately confirm the report.
   The drama began Aug. 3 when 9-year-old Said Agel Filho was abducted
in front of his home in the central Brazilian city of
Goiania, 850 miles northwest of Rio.
   Six days later, police traced a phone call from the kidnappers to the
boy's family and surrounded a house on the city's
outskirts. The kidnappers negotiated a ransom of about $42,000 and an armored
car to escape.
   Three adults, including two television news reporters, then offered
to exchange places with the boy, and the kidnappers accepted.
   The kidnappers, identified as two married couples, headed for the Goiania
Airport, but authorities there refused to give them a
plane and pilot. The kidnappers then set off on a 500-mile trip through
the states of Goias, Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo.
   To eat, one kidnapper stepped out of the car holding a pistol to a
captive's head.
   The hostages were released unharmed Sunday after authorities in Presidente
Prudente, 630 miles southwest of Rio, provided the
kidnappers with a plane and a pilot.
   ``I lived for four days with a pistol at my head but not for one minute
did I believe I would die,'' said released hostage Monica
Calassa. ``A person who trades their life for that of another's can't die
like that.''
   A police spokesman, Nivaldo de Pirondi, told The Associated Press the
pilot who flew the getaway plane was Aniceto de Oliveira
Gomes, a rancher and a local mayor. De Pirondi said a second unidentified
man accompanied Gomes on the plane.
   Brazilian press reports said the group planned to fly to Paraguay where
their leader, identified as Rui Ribeiro de Campos, owns a
farm.
   Several previous attempts to negotiate the hostage's release in exchange
for getaway transportation for the kidnappers ended in
failure.
   A plane promised by police on Friday developed mechanical troubles
and was forced to land in a nearby field.
   On Saturday, police agreed to supply a helicopter and pilot to fly
the kidnappers to Paraguay. But the plan collapsed at the last
minute when the pilot refused to fly the craft after the kidnappers demanded
they carry submachine guns, hand grenades, pistols and
shotguns aboard.
   Police dispatched a plane Saturday night but the pilot was forced to
turn back as darkness made it impossible to land on the
narrow highway where the kidnappers' car was parked.

   Four congressmen plan to accompany Rep. Mickey Leland's body back to
the United States after it is retrieved
from the wreckage of a plane crash in Ethiopia, while President Bush says
he is ``truly saddened'' by ``this tragic accident.''
   The president said Sunday the Texas Democrat and his 15 companions
were ``engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the hungry''
when their plane crashed after taking off from Addis Ababa for a refugee
camp near the Sudan border.
   After learning that the plane was found Sunday on a remote Ethiopian
mountain 100 miles from its destination, Bush asked two
White House officials to accompany a congressional team that will bring
the bodies of Leland and eight other Americans back to the
United States.
   An administration official said a decision on when the delegation would
leave Washington would hinge on the identification of the
bodies.
   Flags were quickly lowered to half staff at the White House and elsewhere
in official Washington on Sunday and national leaders
expressed sorrow at the loss of the congressman and others on the plane.
   ``I want to ... simply express the profound sadness that we feel at
the loss of the lives in Ethiopia,'' the president said.
``It's a sadness for everybody. He was an outstanding man, a man of great
humor.''
   Bush also released a statement that said he was ``truly saddened to
hear that the discovery of Mickey Leland's aircraft revealed
that apparently there were no survivors of this tragic accident.''
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in a telegram today to Leland's
family, called him ``one of the champions of human rights,
a great friend of Israel and an enthusiastic supporter of the issue of
Ethiopian Jewry.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the House had lost one
of its most dedicated, committed and energetic members.
   ``In his search to look at into the plight of the world's most desperate
and hungry individuals, Rep. Leland represented the best
in compassion that we as a nation possess,'' Foley said. ``His was a mission
which, as we all know all too well now, was fraught
with potential danger.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, extended his sympathies
to relatives and friends of Leland and the other
victims. ``Leland had a special devotion to the less fortunate and particularly
to those who suffer from the tragedy of hunger,'' he
said.
   Rep. Jack Fields, a Texas Republican asked to make the trip by House
Minority Leader Bob Michel, said the remoteness of the area
and the weather would affect how quickly the bodies can be brought out
of the mountain ravine where scattered pieces of the plane
were found.
   The Pentagon said U.S. Air Force searchers confirmed there were no
survivors at the crash site. Navy Capt. Stan Bloyer said the
plane ``basically disintegrated'' when it slammed into a mountainside and
caught fire.
   Michel also designated Rep. Bill Emerson, ranking Republican on the
House Select Committee on Hunger, to make the trip, while
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley authorized Majority Whip William H. Gray
III, D-Pa., and Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of
the Congressional Black Caucus, to travel to Addis Ababa.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Frederick C. McClure, Bush's
chief liaison to Congress, and a deputy, Nicholas Calio,
would join the congressional delegation.
   Leland, chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, was making
his second trip to the Horn of Africa since March to promote
relief efforts for hundreds of thousands of starving Sudanese.
   Gray said the plane crash ``deprives us all of a man whose compassion,
commitment and leadership in the war against hunger saved
the lives of tens of thousands of the world's children. Those of us who
are his colleagues and friends can best keep his spirit
alive by renewing our commitment to the cause for which he gave his life:
eradicating hunger both here and around the world.''
   Leland's wife, six weeks pregnant with their second child, remained
in seclusion Sunday at her home in Houston.
   Members of the congressman's Washington staff received congressional
colleagues and friends privately in Leland's offices on
Sunday.
   Among those visiting was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said Leland had
worked tirelessly to ``prick the conscience of Congress''
about the starving in Africa.
   ``I have watched him stand in these halls and literally break down
crying, trying to appeal to other congresspeople to be
sensitive to the fact that people in Ethiopia ... were clutching to his
ankles and dying before his eyes,'' Jackson said.
   Dellums said those aboard the aircraft _ including one of his staff
members, Joyce Francine Williams _ ``gave their lives nobly,
in an effort to advocate on behalf of people much less fortunate than themselves.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said Leland died as he lived: ``On a
mission of mercy and hope for victims of poverty, injustice,
racism and hunger. Wherever suffering people existed on our planet, Mickey
Leland wanted to be there to help.''
   ``There is a special Jewish word that describes Mickey Leland, `mensch'
_ it means `a real human being.' The Anti-Defamation
League has been privileged to know and work with him,'' said league national
director Abraham H. Foxman.
   The State Department called Leland an outstanding statesman and humanitarian
and praised his efforts on behalf of the hungry.

   Spouses and children of U.S. Embassy personnel returned to Beijing
on Monday, and they were greeted with flowers,
American flags and hugs.
   The 40 American dependents had been evacuated from China shortly after
the army shot its way into Beijing to crush the
pro-democracy protests, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of unarmed
civilians. Shots also were fired into the U.S. diplomatic
compound.
   The evacuation order expired last week, allowing the families to be
reunited.
   ``It's great to have her back,'' U.S. Ambassador James R. Lilley said
after his wife, Sally Booth Lilley, arrived on United
Airlines Flight 829 from Tokyo.
   ``The situation was judged calm enough to allow their return,'' Lilley
said. ``There's still alot of work to do in China-U.S
relations.''
   Families of other embassies, including the British Embassy and the
Australian Embassy, returned to China last month.
   Mrs. Lilley left Beijing about one month after arriving with her husband,
who took up his post as U.S. Ambassador to China on May
2.
   ``I'm happy 'cause I get to see my mother,'' said one young girl, whose
mother, an embassy official, remained in Beijing after
her family evacuated to the United States.
   Five American oil company employees also returned to Beijing on the
same flight en route to an oil field in remote Gansu province
in China's arid northwest.
   ``Yeh, we're glad to be back,'' said Pat Pyle of Carlsbad, N.M.

   Twenty years after it rocked the nation, the Woodstock festival reverberates
in America's consciousness, a
national poll has found. But people say Woodstock's hallmark, rock 'n'
roll music, has lost its tune.
   Most Americans have heard of the three-day counterculture concert,
three in 10 of them wish they'd been there and nearly six in
10 say it has had a lasting effect on society, the Media General-Associated
Press poll found.
   But the view of Woodstock was not idealized. Only half those who saw
a lasting impact said it was a positive one, and just a
quarter of the 1,163 respondents said the Woodstock era was a better time
than today.
   Featuring many of the top rock 'n' roll bands of the day, Woodstock
drew half a million people to a muddy farm in upstate New
York from Aug. 15-17, 1969. The term ``Woodstock Nation'' soon came to
describe young people demanding an end to the Vietnam War and
the loosening of social mores.
   Of the eight in 10 respondents who had heard of Woodstock, 70 percent
said they regarded it more as the expression of a social
movement than simply a music festival. And half of them said that social
movement continues today.
   Woodstock-era rock 'n' roll did well in the test of time: Rock music
of the Woodstock days was rated twice as highly as today's
rock 'n' roll, and nearly half of all respondents said they still listen
to Woodstock rock.
   The poll, conducted by telephone among a random sample of respondents
July 7-16, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
   It found a distinct generational split in views of Woodstock. Forty
percent of the respondents younger than 45 would have liked
to have attended, for example, compared with just 10 percent of the older
respondents.
   Moreover, among people who said the festival had a lasting social impact,
more than 60 percent of the younger group said it was a
positive effect, while only about a quarter of older respondents agreed.
   Interest in rock music followed similar lines. More than 60 percent
of those under 45 said they listen to Woodstock-era rock 'n'
roll now, evidence of the sizable audience for ``classic rock'' radio programming.
Of those 45 and older, just 22 percent were tuned
in to Woodstock rock.
   Overall, half rated rock music of the late 1960s and early 1970s as
excellent or good, while just 27 percent gave favorable
ratings to today's rock 'n' roll. Among respondents under 45, seven in
10 gave high ratings to Woodstock rock, while only four in 10
approved of newer rock.
   Twenty percent of the respondents said they knew someone who attended
the Woodstock festival, and 2 percent, or 25 of the 1,163
people polled, said they were there.

<HEAD>Hair Dryer Recall Announced; Government Warns About Dangers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An estimated 17 Americans are accidentally electrocuted by hair dryers
each year, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Monday in announcing a voluntary recall of some 250,000
dryers by four firms.
   Officials of the commission said more than half of the victims are
children playing with hair dryers in the bathtub.
   David Schmeltzer, associate executive director for compliance and administrative
litigation, said the hair dryers being withdrawn
failed to meet a voluntary standard, adopted in 1987, requiring hair dryers
to have a cut-off device to prevent fatal leakage of
current when a dryer enters the water with the switch in the ``off'' position.
   ``The staff is contacting other firms seeking additional recalls,''
he said.
   Schmeltzer estimated there are about 80 million hair dryers still in
the hands of consumers that do not employ the new immersion
protection technology.
   ``Most consumers have the erroneous idea that when a hair dryer is
turned off it does not create an electrocution hazard,'' he
said. ``This is simply not the case.''
   Schmeltzer, holding a hair dryer in his hand, said, ``You don't have
to stretch your imagination to realize that a young child,
particularly a boy, can simulate or think that it appears like a gun.''
   ``It makes noises; it's like a ray gun, it's something that would come
out of `Star Wars,' `Star Trek' or even `Indiana Jones,'''
he said.
   Schmeltzer said children also turn the hair dryers on and use them
to propel sailboats, rubber ducks and other floating toys.
   Girls, he said, sometimes use them to dry their dolls' hair.
   Bill Walton, head of engineering sciences for the commission, described
what he said is a typical scenario:
   ``The hair dryer is plugged in, and the parent or grandparent leaves
the room for a few seconds, perhaps to answer the telephone,
perhaps to dry and dress another child, or perhaps to get clothing. The
child reaches up, takes the hair dryer and, either on
purpose or accidentally, inserts the hair dryer into the water. We have
a sudden death. The child's heart has stopped. There have
been no splashes, no screams, no noises at all. The parent comes back and
finds the child or children dead.''
   ``While any child's death is tragic, these electrocutions are particularly
devastating because they are all preventable,'' said
Anne Graham, acting chairman of the commission.
   She said the firms that have agreed to recall hair dryers, and the
dryers involved, are MBR Industries, Miami, Pomair Pro 2100
and 1900; Mustang Electronics, Hallandale, Fla, Mustang MU 2100; Major
International Inc., Orange, Calif., Major Styling Dryer Model
1250; and China Bazaar, San Francisco, Minimate Hair Dryer and Iron DS-601.
   The commission said the Minimate dryers had been stopped in inventory
before being sold to consumers. People who have bought one
of the others can take them back to the store and get a refund or replacement,
the commission said.
   In addition to seeking corrective action from importers of hair dryers,
virtually all of which are manufactured abroad, the
commission is urging householders to have ground fault circuit interrupters
installed in bathrooms. These are devices which
interrupt the flow of electricity if a dryer or other device is immersed
in water.
   ``At the very least, these hair dryers should never be left plugged
in, especially in homes with children,'' Schmeltzer said.

<HEAD>Connecticut Stops Segregating Inmates With AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Connecticut has settled a
federal lawsuit by agreeing to stop segregating inmates suffering
from AIDS.
   ``This consent decree reflects our new knowledge and
understanding of AIDS,'' Clarine Nardi Riddle, acting Connecticut
attorney general, said today.
   Judy Greenspan of the American Civil Liberties Union's national
prison project in Washington, praised the settlement as a landmark.
Attorneys said the settlement could affect similar lawsuits pending
in California and Alabama.
   ``By not segregating those with full-blown AIDS, Connecticut will
set an example for the rest of the country,'' Greenspan said.
   William Flower, a spokesman for the state prison system, said the
state stopped housing AIDS patients separately about six months ago
in response to the suit.
   Before that, inmates with AIDS symptoms were confined to an AIDS
ward for up to 23 hours a day at the maximum-security prison in
Somers. They were not allowed to take part in education, recreation
and religious programs.
   Under the settlement, there no longer will be a separate AIDS
ward, said Deborah Chang, an attorney for the inmates.
   Inmates' attorneys had charged that inmates put in the AIDS ward
with serious AIDS-related symptoms were kept there even after
showing improvement.
   ``The result was that a lot of people in the prison population
who were HIV-infected refused to go for treatment,'' said Chang.
   Five AIDS-infected inmates had brought the class-action lawsuit
against the state in 1988. Three of the inmates have since died.
   Flower said there is no reliable estimate of the number of
inmates infected with the AIDS virus. At last count, five were being
treated for AIDS-related illnesses in the system's acute care unit,
he said.
   But there is no mandatory testing for the virus, and some
officials have estimated that as many as 25 percent of the prison
system's 8,800 inmates carry the virus.

<HEAD>War On Drugs Has Crippled Drug Traffickers, Thornburgh Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's six-year war on drugs
has made significant inroads in crippling and dismantling major drug
trafficking organizations, U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh
said Monday.
   Thornburgh's comments were in stark opposition to those of Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., who set out a nine-point drug program during
an emotional address here Sunday before the same congress of
correctional officers.
   Thornburgh said that since the drug enforcement task forces were
created in 1983, prosecutors have announced nearly 5,000 indictments
naming nearly 17,000 defendants.
   ``The striking results reflected in this annual report not only
underscore the effectiveness of this effort, but provide notice to
criminal organizations dealing in drugs that our resolve to destroy
them is unwavering,'' Thornburgh told the 119th congress of the
American Correctional Association.
   Biden told the corrections professionals that U.S. politicans
talk about waging a war against drug abuse but haven't shown the
courage of matching their rhetoric with the money to pay for
education and treatment.
   He warned that unless the war on drugs gets serious, the nation
faces disaster.
   ``It's now time for politicans, myself included, to stop talking
and start paying for what we say America needs to fight the drug
epidemic,'' said Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   He blamed the lack of action on ``read my lips politics,'' a
pointed reference to President Bush's promise not to raise taxes.
Biden said Congress should instead ``read the lips of the American
people when they say, `Give us back our neighborhoods.'
   ``One thing is for sure, we have to get serious,'' Biden said.
``We have no war on drugs. We need a D-Day; we don't need another
Vietnam.''
   Biden outlined a program that emphasized drug treatment,
especially in prisons, research into cures for addiction and
education. He complained the nation was missing an opportunity to
break the ``drug-crime cycle'' because of the lack of drug treatment
programs in prisons.
   The drug problem is expected to be a major topic of discussion
throughout the five-day corrections conference.

<HEAD>Scientists Report Vaccine Protects Monkeys from AIDS Virus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTHBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists today reported that an
experimental vaccine protected monkeys from the AIDS virus, but they
warned that the approach is unlikely to work in humans.
   Scientists from the New England Regional Primate Research Center
gave inactivated virus to six macaque monkeys. Two remained free of
infection when challenged with live virus. The others contracted the
virus but did not get sick.
   The researchers said theirs is the first published report
describing successful vaccine protection against infection by the
AIDS virus.
   ``At the very least, this vaccine seems to delay or prevent the
onset of disease symptoms,'' said Dr. Ronald C. Desrosiers, who
headed the team. ``In some cases, it seems to have even prevented
infection.''
   Their report was published in today's issue of the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.
   The scientists cautioned that the experiment was conducted under
carefully controlled laboratory conditions. The monkeys were
monitored extremely closely and challenged with virus when their
immune response from vaccination was the strongest.
   Desrosiers said that a human vaccine would have to elicit a more
powerful and sustained immune response.
   ``While we believe that this demonstrates that it is possible to
achieve some protection, a similar vaccine with the human virus is
not likely to be useful in humans,'' he said.
   The work was first presented in June at an AIDS meeting in
Montreal. At the meeting, researchers from the the University of
California, Davis, reported trying a similar approach in monkeys,
but their attempt failed to protect the animals from infection.
   Both experiments used vaccine made from inactivated simian
immunodeficiency virus, or SIV. This virus is a close relative of
HIV, the virus the causes AIDS in people.

<TEXT>
   Some 270,000 American adults are suffering a
serious stress reaction from the killing of a family member, a new
study estimates.
   And about 1 million have suffered such a homicide-related case of
post-traumatic stress disorder at some point in their lives, the
study says.
   It also estimated that 5 million Americans older than 18 have
lost an immediate family member to homicide, and an additional 11.4
million have lost other relatives or close friends.
   ``The sudden, violent death of a family member brings with it
serious psychological consequences for many family survivors,'' said
Angelynne Amick, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor at
the Medical University of South Carolina.
   She discussed the work Sunday at the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association. The study defined homicide as
being killed by a criminal or a drunk driver.
   Post-traumatic stress disorder includes such symptoms as
persistent and intrusive reliving of the trauma and a general
numbing of responsiveness.
   The study involved a national survey of about 12,000 people and
detailed interviews with a nationally representative sample of 214
of them, Amick said.
   Two other studies of people affected by crimes against others
focused on the impact of rape.
   One work found that those emotionally close to a rape victim, the
people to whom she turns for support, often share ``the social
stereotypes of rape as, at least in part, the woman's fault,'' said
researcher Ellen Brickman.
   Preliminary results from a study of 75 people close to victims of
rape or assault found that rape victims were more often blamed for
the incident than assault victims were, she said.
   When blame is communicated, it does not seem to affect the amount
of emotional or practical support from the people doing the blaming,
said Brickman, of the Victim Services Agency in New York.
   This complex mix of reactions must be studied further, Brickman
said. The reactions ``can have a profound impact on what the people
closest to the victim communicate to her,'' and how the victim
endures the aftermath of violent crime, she said.
   Another study suggests that non-supportive behaviors of other
people have a stronger impact on a rape victim's recovery than
supportive behaviors do.
   Non-supportive behaviors include refusing to discuss the
incident, telling the victim to forget about it, blaming her for it
and asking the victim for emotional support for one's own problems,
said researcher Robert Davis.
   Supportive behaviors include such things as practical help with
daily activities, said Davis, of the New York victim services agency.

   Superior Court Judge Donald T. Dorsey accepted the unanimous
findings of an examining panel that David R. Peterson can understand
the charges and assist in his defense.
   At the same time, the panel found that Peterson was mentally ill
and had delusions of persecution.
   A hearing on the murder charges was set for Sept. 12.
   Police said that Peterson, 37, walked off the grounds of
Connecticut Valley Hospital, took a bus downtown, bought a hunting
knife and attacked Jessica Short at random in a crowd of hundreds.
She was stabbed repeatedly in the face and chest.
   Officials have since tightened security at state mental hospitals.

   President Bush, saying ``farmers have indeed
suffered,'' today signed legislation providing nearly $900 million
in disaster relief for farms where crops were battered this year by
rain, drought and other foul weather.
   In remarks at a signing ceremony, Bush said the Disaster
Assistance Act of 1989 brings ``important relief to farm families
hit by the extreme weather.''
   ``The farmer is at the mercy of the forces of nature, and
sometimes nature fails him,'' said the president, who persuaded
Congress to trim the relief package to $897 million from an earlier
$1.3 billion version passed by the House.
   ``This act will help farmers recover after damaging rain and wind
and will see others through a year when they've had to stand by and
watch their crops fail, Bush said.
   ``In a number of states from the Dakotas to the Texas Panhandle
and in the mid-Atlantic states as well, farmers have indeed
suffered, and this bill provides relief,'' he said. He also noted
that the winter wheat levels in Kansas were less than half normal
levels.
   ``The prevailing climate here in Washington is one of fiscal
restraint and money's tight. And that's why it is good news that the
cost of the disaster relief ... is reasonable,'' the president said.
   ``It will provide relief only to those farmers hardest hit by
adverse weather and it wisely rewards those who took the prudent
step of purchasing crop insurance,'' he said.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said later that $400
million of the new relief will go to wheat producers in his and
other states, who were hit the hardest.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said, ``We would much have
preferred to have a much more limited piece of legislation. And it
may work out, as a matter of fact, to be much limited in its
administration.''
   Farmers who participated in this year's price support program and
purchased crop insurance will be paid at 65 percent of the target
price for any losses beyond 35 percent of normal production.
   Those who were in the program but didn't buy crop insurance will
be compensated for losses beyond 40 percent of their normal
production. Those who were not in the program are eligible only if
their losses exceed 50 percent, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   Bush said he was also pleased that ``this law loosens some of the
controls that limit what farmers can plant, leaving more farmers
free then to choose the crops they grow and to diversify
agricultural production.''
   The president also was dispatching two aides with a congressional
delegation bound for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to bring back the
remains of Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and other Americans killed
in the crash of their mercy flight to a refugee camp. It was not
certain when the delegation would depart.
   Frederick McClure, the White House's top lobbyist, and a deputy,
Nicholas Calio, will join four members of Congress on the mission.
   Bush was informed at Camp David on Sunday that the wreckage had
been discovered on a remote hillside after an intense search. Bush
said in a statement that Leland and the others had died ``in a noble
cause _ trying to feed the hungry.''
   Later, after returning to the White House, Bush told reporters of
the ``profound sadness that we feel at the loss of the lives in
Ethiopia.''
   He said he had not yet spoken with the Texas congressman's widow,
Alison, ``but I certainly express my profound sadness, profound
regrets over all of this to her, and to their child.''
   He called the Houston congressman ``an outstanding man, a man of
great humor. Everyone from Texas knew of his lively nature and his
commitment to helping others.''
   With a smile, Bush recalled that both the Lelands had been his
guests ``in a happier time'' just 12 days earlier at a barbecue for
members of Congress on the South Lawn of the White House.
   Bush also conveyed his thanks to the government of Ethiopia and
to the U.S. military team that found the wreckage in what he called
``this almost unprecedented search.''
   The farm relief package is far less costly than the $4 billion
relief bill enacted during last year's drought. It will help farmers
still facing parched fields in parts of the Great Plans and western
Corn Belt, as well as farmers in parts of the South where flooding
wiped out rice and cotton crops.
   To qualify for relief, farmers in the government subsidy program
for corn, wheat, cotton, tobacco, peanuts and sugar must suffer a 40
percent crop loss. The threshold will be 45 percent for soybean and
sunflower growers and 50 percent for fruit and vegetable farmers.

   Three-fourths of all teen-agers and nearly half
of all adults are ready to volunteer time to drug prevention
programs, education and treatment and 9 in 10 Americans want tougher
anti-drug laws, a new Gallup poll showed today.
   ``The American people are in a wartime mode,'' said George Gallup
in a White House news conference.
   William Bennett, the national drug control director who will make
the Bush Administration's policy public early next month, said ``the
American people have given a very clear sense of direction to us,''
in the poll.
   ``The public is ready to take action on all fronts,'' he said.
   The survey showed that drug abuse was listed by 32 percent of
teen-agers as the most important problem facing the country, ahead
of fear of war, 14 percent;, economic issues, 13 percent;
environment and pollution, 7 percent; AIDS, 5 percent; crime, 3
percent; and abortion, 2 percent.
   Bennett said he didn't want to disclose the administration's new
policy prematurely but said ``if there is a subtitle to our
strategy, it is everybody plays. Everybody must do something.''
   Gallup interviewed 1,005 adults and 500 teen-agers in June and
July in what he said was the first project of the newly formed
Gallup International Foundation.
   ``A record number of Americans cite the drug crisis as the
nation's top problem, replacing the `guns and butter' issues of
international tensions and economic worries,'' he said. ``In the 50
years that the U.S. public has been asked to name the most important
problem facing the nation, it is virtually unprecedented for any
social issue to appear at the top of the list.''
   He said 75 percent of teens and 48 percent of adults said they
would be willing to work in drug programs and while there is a gap
between what people say and what they will do, ``it is clear there
are enormous numbers of Americans waiting to be mobilized in the war
on drugs.''
   The margin of error was given as four percentage points for the
adults questioned and six percentage points for the smaller group of
teens surveyed.

   Israel's Supreme Court on Monday rejected an
appeal by an American who sought to block his extradition to the
United States to face charges of attempted murder and arson, the
national news agency Itim said.
   Joel Davis of Silver Spring, Md., was accused in a U.S. court in
Baltimore in 1985 of hiring three men to kill an Internal Revenue
Service agent to block an investigation into Davis' financial
affairs, Itim said.
   Davis, 47, was also accused of paying $15,000 to burn down a
vacation village known as Torah Town that he owned in New York, in
an attempt to collect fire insurance, the news agency said.
   Davis reportedly fled to Israel shortly after he was indicted,
and his extradition was requested in 1987 after U.S. officials
discovered him in Jerusalem.
   A Jerusalem District Court ordered his extradition last year, but
Davis appealed to the Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Sullivan, Citing New Treatments, Urges More Voluntary AIDS Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan on Monday said
the success of new treatments should encourage more people to be
tested for AIDS, though he offered no assurance these therapies
would be available to those who cannot afford them.
   Sullivan also said the government and local communities must do a
better job targeting AIDS prevention messages to minorities, and he
said people with AIDS must not be treated as ``political footballs.''
   Speaking at the opening session of a national conference on AIDS
among racial and ethnic populations, the secretary noted that the
disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the minority community.
   Blacks, who comprise 12 of the U.S. population, represent 26
percent of adult AIDS cases in the United States and 53 percent of
pediatric cases, he said. Hispanics, who make up 7 percent of the
nation's population, represent 15 percent of adult cases and 23
percent of pediatric cases.
   ``We must increasingly develop accurate and credible information
campaigns that will successfully reach and motivate Americans who
have been missed by our previous efforts,'' Sullivan said. ``That
means we must develop culturally relevant and sensitive materials
that can be carefully targeted to an identified group.''
   However, he added, ``community standards must be respected'' in
messages designed to educate about the disease that is often
transmitted through sexual contact.
   Homosexual and bisexual men comprise 62 percent of the nation's
AIDS cases, though intravenous drug users who now represent 20
percent of the cases are the fastest growing segment of people with
the disease.
   Sullivan said the epidemic must remain focused on public health,
with no judgments about morality.
   ``People with AIDS must not be treated as bargaining chips or
political footballs. They must be given our compassion, our respect
and our best efforts,'' he said.
   He added: ``We must end the specter of discrimination.''
   As of July 30, The total number of Americans diagnosed with AIDS
reached 102,621, of whom 59,391 have died since July 1, 1981,
according to the Centers for Disease Control.
   Between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans are believed to be
infected with the virus, though many of them do not know it because
they have never been tested, Sullivan said.
   With new therapies being approved to treat the disease in its
early states and prolong survival, more people should be pursuaded
to get tested, he said.
   Asked in a brief session with reporters after his address how the
government plans to make these therapies available to those who test
positive but cannot pay for the treatments, he offered little
assurance.
   ``The federal role is not the sole responsibility for addressing
this problem,'' he said. ``Certainly state governments and local
governments as well as private insurance also have a role to play.
   ``The picture is one we're constantly evaluating, and if we find
we're falling short within an area we know we can do better, we're
going to be seeking those additional funds,'' he said.
   He said President Bush's proposed fiscal 1990 budget did not
include any money for early intervention treatments because when the
spending plan was drafted, the therapies now proving successful were
not known to be effective. He said he was ``looking to Congress to
address that.''

<HEAD>U.N. Team to Visit Cambodian Guerrilla Bases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. team working on a Cambodian peace
plan arrived Monday to visit guerrilla bases on the Thai side of the
border.
   The 15-member group, mostly military specialists, spent a week in
Cambodia to determine what would be needed to form an international
body to monitor a Vietnamese troop pullout and a truce.
   The team inspected the country's transport and communications,
and visited the Vietnamese border.
   ``We were able to see as much as we could in the days we were in
Cambodia,'' the team's leader, Lt. Gen. Martin O. Vadset of Norway,
said in Bangkok. ``It is difficult to cover every square meter of
any country, and the infrastructure in Cambodia implies that you
cannot move as fast as you could, even if you use helicopters.''
   Vadset said his team plans to meet with Foreign Minister Siddi
Savetsila of Thailand and representatives of the three Cambodian
guerrilla factions.
   Maj. Gen. Amporn Chuataputhi, Thai liaison officer for the U.N.
team, said the team would start Tuesday by visiting a northern base
controlled by forces of the joint resistance leader Prince Sihanouk.
   The group plans to travel to a camp of the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front on Wednesday and an area controlled by the
Khmer Rouge on Thursday.
   The Communist Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people
when it ruled Cambodia for nearly four years. Vietnam invaded in
late 1978, driving out the Khmer Rouge and installing another
Communist government.
   Jamshid Anvar, the U.N. team's political adviser, said the visit
to the resistance's military bases would be the first official one
by the United Nations.
   The Vietnamese pullout of 26,000 troops from Cambodia, announced
for late September, will leave the Vietnamese-installed government
in Phnom Penh fighting the guerrilla coalition unless international
peace talks in Paris take a dramatic turnaround.
   Nations at the talks sent the U.N. team to the region to help in
their efforts to prepare a settlement. The team plans to leave for
Paris on Sunday and report back to the conference.
   One team member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it may
require 120 personnel to monitor the pullout and about 6,000 to form
a peacekeeping force. The effort would cost hundreds of millions of
dollars and probably could not be organized outside U.N. auspices,
he said.
   The prime minister of the pro-Vietnamese government, Hun Sen, has
opposed a peacekeeping force and a U.N. role in the peace process.

<HEAD>HHS Proposes New Eligibility Rules for Disabled Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday proposed revised rules
for determining which children have mental impairments that make
them eligible for disability payments under the Supplemental
Security Income program.
   The Department of Health and Human Services said the proposed
changes would provide more explicit methods for evaluating childhood
impairments including chronic brain syndrome, psychotic disorders
and mental retardation.
   HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said the changes ``will assure
that our decision-making process keeps pace with the advances in
medical knowledge in the mental health field.''
   Social Security spokesman Phil Gambino said the changes, which
are subject to public comment for 60 days, could result in a slight
increase in the number of children who qualify for disability
payments.
   More than 250,000 children receive SSI benefits, almost half of
whom are mentally impaired.
   SSI, administered by the Social Security Administration, provides
a minimal income floor for the nation's aged, disabled and blind.
Maximum benefits are $368 a month.

   Oil's down, real estate's reeling and banks
are in the red. But politicians aren't letting that crimp their
big-spending style in the race to replace multimillionaire oilman
Bill Clements as governor.
   Political analysts are predicting a big-spending free-for-all
next year in the first race in more than 20 years in which an
incumbent Texas governor isn't seeking re-election.
   Democratic Attorney General Jim Mattox, who has collected more
than $4 million for his expected campaign, disagreed with a recent
newspaper report that suggested gubernatorial spending could hit $50
million.
   ``I think that's way too low,'' he said.
   GOP candidate Jack Rains, a former Texas secretary of state and
founder of the 3D International engineering and design firm, put it
another way:
   ``I am prepared to stand toe-to-toe and wad up dollar bills and
start throwing them,'' Rains said. ``They're going to run out of
money before all of my friends and I do.''
   Besides Mattox and Rains, the lineup of people planning or
considering bids for Clements' office includes a rising national
Democratic star, a pair of comeback minded ex-governors, a
millionaire oilman and rancher, a Democrat-turned-Republican, and
corporate raider T. Boone Pickens.
   But it doesn't include President Bush's eldest son, George W.
Bush of Dallas, co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team.
Although many Republicans said he would be the front-runner, Bush
bowed out Aug. 1, saying the only race he cares about is for the
American League pennant.
   Clements, the state's only Republican governor this century, had
announced shortly after winning his second term that he didn't
intend to seek a third. He'll be 73 when the term expires in January
1991. The last incumbent to voluntarily step down was John Connally
in 1968.
   In the wake of Republican inroads in Texas, Democratic national
Chairman Ron Brown recently said the state is crucial to party hopes
for the 1990s. He noted that no Democrat has been elected president
this century without carrying Texas, and added, ``We have got to
recapture the statehouse here.''
   But that's a costly proposition in a state that spans two time
zones and has more than 20 television markets. The 1986 race, for
example, saw combined spending by Clements and then-Gov. Mark White
of about $25 million though both had little opposition.
   While the primary isn't until March 1990, candidates in both
parties have been jockeying for months. Only three have formally
declared, but a fourth is ready to do so Tuesday and others are
raising money or admit to ``considering'' a race.
   State Treasurer Ann Richards is the only announced Democratic
candidate. She became an instant celebrity after her 1988 Democratic
National Convention keynote speech accusing President Bush of being
``born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' She has banked more than
$1 million and favors abortion rights and more action to help the
environment.
   Three other Democrats are considering a run:
   _ Mattox. Except for his first try for party precinct chairman,
he has never lost a race for public office. The former congressman
compiled an activist record on consumer fraud, nursing home abuse
and environmental issues.
   _ White. He ousted Clements in 1982, only to be ousted in return
in 1986. Now a lawyer in Houston, White says he'll decide by fall
whether to try a Clements-style comeback.
   _ Dolph Briscoe, who was elected governor in 1972 and lost the
Democratic primary in 1978. The 65-year-old multimillionaire rancher
and banker says there is a vacuum of conservative leadership in the
party.
   There are two announced Republican candidates and a third set to
make his formal announcement this week:
   _ Clayton Williams, oilman, rancher, telephone company founder,
who pledged to spend $3 million of his own to win the Republican
nomination. But his start was a little rocky when news reports noted
that Williams contributed to two Democratic potential rivals, Mattox
and Ms. Richards, last year.
   _ Rains. He was campaign strategist for Clements, who appointed
him secretary of state, the state's top political patronage job, in
1987. He quit the post when he launched his gubernatorial bid.
   _ Kent Hance, who is planning his formal announcement Tuesday. A
one-time Democratic congressman from Lubbock, he lost the 1984
Democratic nomination for Senate, then changed parties. His 1986 bid
for governor failed, but he has since become a member of the
powerful Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas production.
   In addition, oilman Pickens, who has staged takeover battles of
such well-known companies as Phillips Petroleum, is reportedly
looking for a new house in Dallas' Republican strongholds and has
said he will decide soon whether to seek a different type of chief
executive's chair.

<HEAD>3 Teens Die While Exploring Abandoned Mine; Gas Suspected</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of teen-agers exploring an
abandoned coal mine apparently were overcome by poison gas, and
three were killed, authorities said Monday.
   A fourth youth rescued from the mine was hospitalized in serious
condition.
   The fifth member of the group walked and ran more than five miles
through rugged desert to get help for his friends after they
collapsed late Sunday, said Mesa County Sheriff's Lt. Wayne Harms.
   Miles Slape, 17, the boy who went for help, reported he had
trouble breathing in the mine, and investigators believed the
teen-agers were poisoned by some kind of gas, Harms said. Autopsies
were ordered.
   ``Those old mines have all kinds of gas, the older the mine the
more gas they have,'' Harms said. ``They're very, very dangerous
things.''
   Killed were two girls _ Christian Rossman, 15, and Catherine
Schrettner, 16 _ and a boy, Greg Folchert, 17. Frank Warner, 16, was
listed in stable but serious condition Monday at St. Mary's
Hostpital in Grand Junction.
   Slape was unhurt, Harms said. He had to go on foot because he
didn't have keys to the car.
   The abandoned Carpenter Mine is northeast of Grand Junction in
eastern Colorado.
   The teen-agers hiked to the mine sometime late Sunday, Harms
said. Slape entered first, but came out to tell his friends he had
trouble breathing$
   ``They didn't believe him so they went in and never came back
out,'' Harms said.
   Slape got worried and went back in the mine but found he couldn't
help his friends, Harms said. He ran for help, and rescuers arrived
at the mine about 11:30 p.m. to find the teen-agers dead inside.

   A federal judge Monday issued a temporary
restraining order that prevents Hartford from awarding a disputed
$1.5 million rent subsidy contract, an attorney said.
   Judge Jose A. Cabranes also set a hearing Wednesday on a lawsuit
filed by Hartconn Associates Inc. of Bridgeport last week against
the city, according to attorney Sue Wise, who represents Hartconn.
   Hartconn claims it lost out on the contract to manage Hartford's
rent subsidy program because its competition, Imagineers Inc., had
better ties to Hartford politicians. The contract was awarded to
Imagineers in July. Imagineers has run the city's Section 8 program
for 13 years.
   Arthur Anderson, president of Imagineers, said last week that
politics played no role in the awarding of the contract and called
the charges ``baloney.''
   Wise said the restraining order would not interfere with the
services provided by the subsidy program.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Larkin Smith, a former sheriff
elected to Congress in November on a law-and-order platform, was
found dead today in the wreckage of a small plane that crashed in a
forest. He was 45.
   The twin-engine plane carrying the Mississippi Republican and his
pilot disappeared from radar screens about 9:30 p.m. Sunday and was
spotted early today from a Customs aircraft 25 miles from
Hattiesburg, authorities said.
   Searchers trekked through heavy woods to reach the site near the
community of Janice, removing the bodies of the congressman and his
pilot, Chuck Vierling, from the wreckage, said acting Harrison
County Sheriff Farley Rhodes.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation.
   Smith was the second congressman in a week to die in a plane
crash. Searchers on Monday discovered the wreckage of Mickey
Leland's plane on a mountainside in Ethiopia six days after the
Texas Democrat's aircraft vanished.
   Smith, who had succeeded Republican Trent Lott, now a U.S.
senator, was returning home to Gulfport from Hattiesburg, where he
had thrown out the first ball at youth baseball tournament, said
press secretary Charles Busby.
   ``The plane was all to pieces,'' said Perry County deputy sheriff
Gene McRee. ``It appeared it centered a big pine tree. There was no
way anyone could have survived.'' McRee said there was no fire.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., said he had spoken to
Smith about Leland's death the night before the crash and had warned
his colleague to be careful traveling.
   ``He was so happy and enjoying being a member of Congress,''
Montgomery said.
   Smith's plane took off in clear weather at 9:10 p.m. for the
90-mile trip to Gulfport, said John Walker, a spokesman for the
congressman.
   Busby said authorities got a call about 10:05 p.m. from a
resident who reported seeing a plane go down in the heavily wooded
area. Dozens of military, civilian and law enforcement rescuers
joined the search in the DeSoto National Forest.
   In his seven months in Congress, Smith, a former police chief
known as a law-and-order candidate, co-sponsored legislation to
strengthen drug laws. He recently objected to drug czar William
Bennett's ban on imports of semiautomatic assault weapons.
   The congressman supported making death penalty laws uniform
across the country, eliminating paroles and early release for
dangerous criminals and streamlining the federal appeals process,
which he called ``never-ending.''
   Smith, who represented Mississippi's 5th Congressional District,
was a member of the Judiciary and Government Operations committees.
He also served on task forces concentrating on defense, crime and
problems of the savings and loan industry.
   Smith, a graduate of William Carey College, was a former police
chief in Gulfport and was Harrison County sheriff before being
elected to Congress in November.
   Survivors include his wife, Sheila, a daughter and a grandson.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Issue Subpoena for Opposition Leader in Spy Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said Monday they have
obtained a subpoena to question opposition leader Kim Dae-jung in
connection with charges that two members of his party spied for
North Korea.
   Kim angrily denied any wrongdoing and said he would comply with
the subpoena to prove his innocence.
   He said his Party for Peace and Democracy has declared political
war on the government of President Roh Tae-woo, which he said was
out to destroy the country's leading opposition.
   ``Our party efforts to cooperate with the regime of President Roh
Tae-woo are over,'' Kim said. ``There can be no dialogue with people
out to destroy us.''
   Prosecutors said Kim would be asked to appear for questioning
Aug. 22 in connection with a secret three-day visit to communist
North Korea by party lawmaker Suh Kyung-won in August 1988.
   Suh, 52, and an aide, Pang Yang-kyun, 34, were indicted Saturday
on charges of being North Korean agents. If convicted, they face
life imprisonment.
   Prosecutors quoted Suh as confessing he had received $50,000
after meeting with North Korean President Kim Il Sung and had given
$10,000 to the party leader after returning to Seoul.
   They also quoted Suh as confessing that he reported back in
mid-April to Kim Dae-jung about his secret trip. That would be two
months earlier than Kim said he was informed of the trip.
   ``I never received a penny of money from him,'' Kim said. ``The
prosecutors' disclosures are 100 percent untrue. He never told me
anything of a secret trip to North Korea.''
   Kim has never denied Suh made the illegal trip. However, he says
his party was not involved and he knew nothing about it until Suh
informed party officials shortly before turning himself in June 25.
   The party leader said he was asking Amnesty International and the
Human Rights Institute in Washington to investigate charges the
South Korean intelligence agency and prosecutors were trying to
discredit the opposition.
   A subpoena also was issued for the party's former floor leader,
Kim Won-kie. Prosecutors said he also knew of Suh's trip in April
but failed to report it as required by law.
   Kim Dae-jung, who was defeated in presidential elections in 1971
and 1987, was questioned by government investigators last week about
whether he knew of Suh's trip in advance or sent a secret message to
North Korean leaders through Suh or other channels.
   After the 22-hour interrogation, Kim said he had been cleared of
all allegations involving him, but officials said their inquiry was
incomplete and would continue.
   Pro-Western South Korea only allows authorized visits to North
Korea, its bitter enemy since the peninsula was divided at the end
of the Korean War.
   Also on Monday, the official North Korea news agency said a
dissident South Korea student planned to try again Tuesday to cross
the border at Panmunjom to return home after an illegal trip to
North Korea.
   The Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, said the
Pyongyang government had again asked that U.N. officials stationed
at the border allow Im Su-kyong to cross. The U.N. Command has said
the nations must work out the dispute.
   Ms. Im, who has said she wants to make her trip a symbolic act
for reunification, originally planned to cross on July 27, but she
says South Korean officials refused.
   The 20-year-old student traveled to North Korea via Japan and
East Germany for an international youth festival July 1-8. She faces
arrest upon her return. Also Monday, the Rev. Allan Boesak of South
Africa told delegates to an international church conference in Seoul
that they should work for reunification.
   ``Supporting the reconciliation and reunification of Korea is a
catchy phrase, but we need to call for action,'' he said at the
conference of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   Boesak, a prominent critic of the South African government and
president of the alliance, also said the delegates should ``pay
special attention'' to the cases of Ms. Im and a clergyman on trial
for an illegal trip to North Korea.

   Vietnam is expanding its international
telecommunication links via another Australian-built satellite earth
station, the Vietnam News Agency said in a dispatch seen Monday.
   The station, named Saigon-1A, was inaugurated Saturday in Ho Chi
Minh City and was the third such project between Australia's
Overseas Telecommunication Commission and the Vietnamese government.
   The agency said the new earth station alllows Vietnam to broaden
its telecommunications services to many countries in the world
through the Intelsat Satellite System.
   Stations in Hanoi and the central Vietnam city of Danang will go
into operation this year, the news agency said. The first station
under the cooperation agreement was opened in Ho Chi Minh City in
1987 and a second started operation in Hanoi this year.

   Deputy Prime Minister M.A. Matin has
resigned following weekend Cabinet changes that elevated his deputy
to the post of prime minister, the government said Monday.
   Matin, who also was in charge of the Health Ministry, resigned
hours after the Cabinet shuffle announced Saturday by President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad, an official announcement said.
   Ershad has accepted the resignation.
   Matin said Monday he was resigning for personal reasons. ``I will
continue to be in the ruling Jaitya Party and pursue the politics of
President Ershad,'' he said.
   Sources close to Matin said he resigned to protest the
appointment of junior Deputy Prime Minister Kazi Zafar Ahmed as
prime minister.
   Ershad appointed prime minister Maudud Ahmed as vice-president
and fired the vice president, Nurul Islam, in the Cabinet shuffle.

   An American man who once pounded on the Berlin Wall
with a jackhammer and staged other protests at the barrier on Monday
entered East Berlin with Western newspapers but was quickly sent
back by East German guards.
   John Runnings of Seattle apparently intended to distribute
Western newspapers in East Berlin, where they are not available.
   But as soon as Runnings, 71, crossed into East Berlin through
Checkpoint Charlie, he was picked up by East German guards.
   Shortly afterward, reporters on the Western side saw Runnings
being picked up by a West Berlin ambulance and returned to West
Berlin. It was not immediately clear if Runnings had been injured.
   Runnings has carried out a one-man campaign against the wall for
several years.
   He had been given an 18-month suspended sentence by an East
Berlin court after he had climbed atop the wall in 1987.
   Runnings' latest action came one day after several protests on
the Western side to mark the 28th anniversary of the construction of
the Berlin Wall by the communists.

   The Who, a British rock band of the 1960s,
fell short of a sellout for their 25th anniversary concert, but for
devoted fans, their performance at the University of Colorado was a
hit.
   The band's reprisals of favorites _ from the overture to
``Tommy,'' the explosive ``Baba O'Riley'' and ``My Generation'' _
had the crowd cheering Sunday evening.
   ``We'll go as far as we have to go to see them,'' said Jon
Ellingson, 27, of Wayne, Neb., reverently dressed in a Union Jack
T-shirt and jeans. ``We've got our flags, our hats, our bandanas.
... We'll be listening to them as long as we can.''
   Fewer than 47,000 of the 57,000 tickets pre-purchased by Boulder
radio station KBCO were sold.
   ``Some people say it was the way we promoted the show, or that
The Who may not be the group that baby boomers wanted to see,'' said
KBCO's 40-year-old general manager Ray Skibitsky.
   ``If I knew the answer,'' he said, ``I would have sold out the
show.''

   Will they have to rename the show ``Jake and the
Trim Man?''
   William Conrad, 68, has lost a sizable portion of the girth that
led to the title ``Jake and the Fatman'' for his CBS series,
currently filming here for the upcoming season.
   ``I was down to 242 from 290 pounds,'' Conrad said in an
interview published Monday. ``This year, I was way down to 235. But
after I worked a couple of weeks, I was really tired. And I needed
to eat. So I know I've put back a couple of pounds. But I want to
get down to 220.''
   He says it hasn't been easy to lose weight in Hawaii, famed for
its international mix of cuisine.
   ``I do love that island food,'' he said. ``But the killer is the
mai tais and the chi chis _ Gosh! I can drink those all day long.''
   Conrad says the Fatman's role, rather than his waistline, will
expand this season.
   ``I simply didn't have enough to do,'' he said. ``I'd show up at
the end of the show and say something like, `Well, is everything OK,
Jake?' Now I look forward to going to work, not only because I have
more to do, but because the scripts have been absolutely great.
We're rolling.''

   Don Johnson has fans so worked up here to

Chamber of Commerce.
   The former star of ``Miami Vice'' and director Dennis Hopper on
Monday began filming ``Hot Spot,'' a crime thriller and love story
that is touted as being in the tradition of the steamy ``Body Heat.''
   Very few residents in this town of about 10,600 about 25 miles
north of Austin have voiced concerns that the movie appears to be
headed to a solid ``R'' rating. Bedroom scenes between Johnson and
Virginia Madsen are to be filmed in a 96-year-old stucco mansion,
according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
   ``What I tell everybody,'' said Chamber Executive Director Debra
Gore, ``is if you have Don Johnson in town you're going to have to

   It's a long way from Butcher Hollow, Ky., to
Boston's Symphony Hall, but country singer Loretta Lynn and her
sister, Crystal Gayle, didn't worry as they waited to rehearse with
the Boston Pops Orchestra.
   ``Well, of course, I did sing one time with Luciano Pavarotti,''
Mrs. Lynn recalled. ``We did an opera song. Don't ask me which one.
You know how opera songs are.''
   The sisters were interviewed by TV Guide magazine as they
prepared for their ``Evening at Pops'' program, scheduled to air on
PBS stations Aug. 25. Their comments appear in the Aug. 19 issue of
the magazine.
   Miss Gayle said her more citified ``pop'' style is one reason for
her success.
   ``There's only one Loretta Lynn,'' she said. ``If I were real
country, I probably wouldn't do as well because people would say,
`She's just trying to sound like her sister.'''
   The sisters teamed up with the 100-piece orchestra to perform
``We've Come a Long Way, Baby,'' ``Wrong Road Again,'' ``One's on
the Way'' and ``Rocky Top.'' Mrs. Lynn was asked if the Boston Pops
was the largest orchestra she'd ever appeared with.
   ``Well, they're the loudest,'' she said.

   Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak said today
he will give up his bid to form a new government and resign so the
leader of the small United Peasant Party can take over and form a
coalition government.
   His announcement, broadcast by the state-run PAP news agency,
came as Solidarity tried to persuade the Peasants, aligned with the
Communists in Parliament, to join in a non-communist coalition.
   ``At the moment, a situation has been created in which I can see
a chance to form a new government by (Peasant leader) Roman
Malinowski in which there would be representatives of all forces
represented at the Parliament,'' Kiszczak said in a statement issued
by PAP.
   Kiszczak was elected prime minister Aug. 2, winning a majority in
Parliament despite objections from the Solidarity caucus, which
holds 35 percent of Parliament's seats.
   Solidarity's Parliament leader, Bronislaw Geremek, refused
comment on Kiszczak's announcement. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
was not at home and could not be reached for comment.
   Walesa said last week that Solidarity could not support a
government formed by Kiszczak, and he invited the Peasant Party and
the Democratic Party, also aligned with the Communists, to join in a
coalition. That would give Poland its first non-communist government
since World War II.
   Earlier today, Walesa tried to arrange talks with Malinowski and
Jerzy Jozwiak, the leader of the Democratic Party, but the two
leaders apparently declined to meet with him.
   Kiszczak said Walesa's proposal ``complicates and prolongs the
process'' of trying to form a government.
   But he said the proposal also indicated Walesa's negative
attitude toward a coalition government had eased, creating a chance
for a ``grand coalition'' in which the opposition would be offered
several ministries.
   Kiszczak said he viewed Malinowski as having the best chance of
forming such a coalition.
   Solidarity has rejected the ``grand coalition'' idea, saying the
new government must have public support to rule and that a
Communist-led coalition would not have such support.
   Kiszczak said he would contact President Wojciech Jaruzelski ``so
that he considers the new situation and draws from it the proper
conclusions.''
   The speaker of the Parliament, Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, said
Jaruzelski must accept Kiszczak's resignation. He said the
Parliament would then have to vote on Malinowski if he were formally
nominated.
   However, Aleksander Bentkowski, the Peasant Party parliamentary
caucus leader, said in a telephone interview he was not sure
Malinowski would accept the nomination because of the slim chances
of successfully forming a coalition.
   Malinowski, 54, has led the Peasant Party since 1981, but he was
among the prominent Communist coalition candidates who failed to win
election in June.
   In the June 4 elections, Solidarity-backed candidates won all 161
seats open to them in the 460-member Sejm, or Parliament, and 99 of
100 seats in the newly created Senate.
   The Communists control 37 percent of the Parliament and
Solidarity has 35 percent. The Peasant Party and Democratic Party
hold the balance of parliamentary power.
   Earlier today, Solidarity Senator Jaroslaw Kaczynski read a brief
statement from Walesa in which he said his offer of a coalition with
the Peasants and Democrats stood.
   Kaczynski confirmed Sunday that Walesa himself was considering
being prime minister in a Solidarity-led coalition government.
   Kaczynski began talks with the two minor parties Thursday and
they continued through the weekend at an undisclosed site, he said.

<HEAD>NASA Says Columbia in Good Shape After Military Flight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot's seat on
Columbia jerked backward about one inch when the space shuttle was
launched last week, but the malfunction caused no problems, a NASA
official said today.
   ``It was exciting when it happened,'' but shuttle pilot Richard
Richards used a motor control to move the seat forward to its normal
position ``and it stayed,'' said Ann Montgomery, in charge of
processing Columbia after its five-day military mission.
   The shuttle's commander and pilot actually do very little during
liftoff, which is almost entirely controlled by computers.
   A leaky in-flight steering thruster will need replacing, but
Columbia's crew shut it down during the flight and used other
thrusters, Montgomery said.
   Only three of the shuttle's roughly 30,000 heat-shielding tiles
were damaged enough to require replacement, based on initial
inspection, she said. Two of the tiles may have been damaged when
yet-unidentified debris fell from the shuttle when it was launched
Tuesday from Florida, she added.
   Overall, Columbia ``looks absolutely beautiful,'' Montgomery
said, adding that workers will examine about 20 other minor
potential problems that developed just before or during Columbia's
flight.
   The shuttle landed at this Mojave Desert military base Sunday
morning after its five-day, one-hour mission to deploy a satellite,
which experts have said is a modified KH-12 spy satellite designed
to photograph military targets. The astronauts also reportedly
performed experiments related to the ``Star Wars'' anti-missile
defense system.
   Columbia probably will leave Saturday for a piggyback flight back
to Cape Canaveral, Fla., atop a modified Boeing 747 jetliner,
Montgomery said.
   Columbia's mission restored the shuttle fleet to three orbiters.
Columbia is the oldest shuttle. It last flew in January 1986,
landing 10 days before Challenger exploded during liftoff, killing
seven crew members. After the accident NASA concentrated on making
safety modifications to the two newer shuttles, Discovery and
Atlantis, before refurbishing Columbia.

<HEAD>Dith Pran in Tearful Reunion Relatives</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SITE 2 REFUGEE CAMP, Thailand (AP) _ Dith Pran, whose escape from
Cambodia during the murderous Khmer Rouge regime was told in the
film ``The Killing Fields,'' had a tearful reunion Monday with
relatives he left behind.
   Dith, 47, met with two sisters-in-law he had not seen since July
1979, when he left another refugee camp in Thailand to live in the
United States. It was his first return visit to the border.
   ``The Killing Fields'' tells the story of how Dith, an assistant
to former New York Times correspondent Sydney Schanberg, survived
the rule of the Khmer Rouge, the radical Communist group that killed
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians between 1975 and 1978.
   Dith escaped from Cambodia after the Vietnamese invasion which
ousted the Khmer Rouge in late 1978. He reached Thailand only after
a hazardous trek through rice fields filled with the bones of the
regime's victims.
   Dith was accompanied at the Site 2 refugee camp on the
Thai-Cambodian border by Haing Ngor, who portrayed Dith in ``The
Killing Fields,'' and David Hawk, of the Cambodian Documentation
Center in New York. Noor also is a Cambodian who escaped the Khmer
Rouge.
   Dith plans a week-long visit to Phnom Penh at the invitation of
Cambodian Premier Hun Sen. The invitation came when Haing and Hawk
met Hun Sen at the ongoing Paris conference on Cambodia earlier this
month.
   Ten years on, a quarter of a million Cambodians still live in
refugee camps in Thailand controlled by one of three guerrilla
factions resisting Hun Sen's Vietnamese-backed government. The Khmer
Rouge is the strongest of these.
   Vietnam has pledged to withdraw all its troops by Sept. 26. Many,
including Dith, fear the Khmer Rouge will make another bid for power.
   Hawk said the Cambodian Documentation Center, set up 10 years ago
to bring the Khmer Rouge to trial for war crimes, is concerned about
the repatriation of refugees should a negotiated settlement be
achieved in Paris.
   ``We are going there looking at the prospects and provisions to
prevent the return to power of the Khmer Rouge ... and the prospects
of safe voluntary repatriation of Cambodian refugees from
Thailand,'' he said.
   Dith said the only way to prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning
to power was to remove their senior leaders. The organization's
leadership hierachy _ which includes a role for Pol Pot, the man who
presided over their rule _ remains intact.
   ``If you cut the head off a chicken, it is easy to deal with the
body. We must not include any of the Khmer Rouge leaders,'' he said.
``We must cut the head off the Khmer Rouge chicken.''
   Dith said Cambodian refugees in Thailand were ``trapped between
the East and the West.''
   ``They want to go to the West but the West says no, they want to
go to the East, to Cambodia, but they cannot,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   West Germany closed its embassy and
consulate Monday to hundreds of East Germans trying reach the West
through Hungary, whose liberal refugee and border policies have
angered some East bloc allies.
   Officials of the three nations conferred in an attempt to ease
friction.
   On Sunday, the West German Foreign Ministry said the embassy and
consulate would be closed indefinitely beginning Monday because the
staff could not deal with so many people.
   Hungary has removed the barbed wire and other obstacles from its
border with Austria, and East Germans are pouring out of their
strict communist nation, which has rejected the political and
economic reform popular elsewhere in the Soviet bloc.
   Tens of thousands of politically and economically disgruntled
East Germans have gone to West Germany this year, the largest flow
to the West since the Berlin Wall was built in August 1961 to stem a
similar tide.
   Dozens of East Germans who spent the night outside the West
German consulate in Budapest in cars or sleeping bags were joined by
scores more on Monday, despite a sign announcing the closure.
   More than 100 had gathered by midafternoon, when Hungarian Red
Cross volunteers arrived with sandwiches and cold drinks.
   ``The embassy and the consulate are temporarily closed,'' said a
sign handwritten in red letters on the consulate gate in an
exclusive neighborhood on the Buda side of the Danube River. A
similar sign was posted on the wrought-iron embassy fence on the
Pest side.
   Officials in Bonn said 181 East Germans were inside the embassy
when the gates were closed and more than 100 soon gathered outside.
   At least 1,600 East Germans are estimated to have crossed
illegally from Hungary to Austria since May, when this liberal
Soviet bloc nation began dismantling the barriers on its western
frontier.
   In Vienna, they go to the West Germany Embassy for documents
needed to enter that country. Sources said at least 200 East Germans
arrived at the embassy over the weekend, which was the 28th
anniversary of the Berlin Wall.
   Hundreds of others did not make it across the border. The daily
Esti Hirlap quoted Interior Ministry officials as saying Hungarian
border guards caught and temporarily detained 471 East Germans
during the weekend.
   Hungary, with a relative abundance of consumer goods and vacation
spots, has been popular with East Germans, who have difficulty
traveling legally to the West.
   More than 1 million East Germans have visited Hungary in each of
the last several years, and this year the level has been running
about 15 percent higher, the Interior Ministry said.
   East Germans who feared authorities at home were told of their
attempts to emigrate illegally started going to the West German
Embassy last month. Many want guarantees of safe passage to the West
before leaving it.
   Members of the political opposition in Hungary say up to 400 East
Germans have gone underground, fearing persecution if they go home.
   West Germany closed its East Berlin mission Aug. 8 after 131 East
Germans seeking guarantees of passage to West Germany sought refuge
inside.
   Hanns Schumacher, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Bonn,
said Monday that 141 adults and 40 children were in the Budapest
embassy. West German media said at least 20 were in the embassy in
Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   East German leader Erich Honecker was quoted by the official news
agency ADN in East Berlin as condemning Western media coverage of
the situating but saying he was ready for ``qualitatively new
steps.''
   Officials in Bonn said, without giving details, that Chancellor
Helmut Kohl sent Honecker a personal message Friday about the
refugees.
   Juergen Suedhoff, deputy foreign minister of West Germany,
conferred with Foreign Minister Gyula Horn of Hungary on Monday, but
details of that meeting also were withheld.
   Hungary's official news agency, MTI, said the two-hour meeting
dealt with ``possible humanitarian solutions'' and that Horn later
called in the East German ambassador, Gerd Vehres, for a briefing.
   Foreign Ministry officials acknowledge privately that East
Germany is irritated by the current situation. Hungary has said
repeatedly that the matter is between the two Germanys.
   West Germany grants citizenship to any East German who reaches
the West, but obtaining an exit visa in East Germany can take years.
East Germans with recent military service or important job skills
are routinely denied permission to leave.

<HEAD>New Law Will Help Farmers Hit by Drought, Flood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed legislation Monday that
will speed $897 million in assistance to farmers whose crops he said
had been battered this year by ``the forces of nature.''
   The bulk of the aid _ $400 million _ will go to wheat farmers
whose winter harvest in Kansas and other states was devastated by
drought.
   At the other extreme, the Disaster Assistance Act will compensate
farmers in the South and elsewhere whose rice, soybean, cotton and
other crops were wiped out by rain, wind and floods.
   ``The farmer is at the mercy of the forces of nature, and
sometimes nature fails him,'' Bush said in a signing ceremony at the
White House.
   Bush, saying ``money's tight,'' said the package will ``provide
relief only to those farmers hardest hit by adverse weather. And it
wisely rewards those who took the prudent step of purchasing crop
insurance.''
   The House had passed a $1.4 billion drought relief bill in June,
but under pressure from the White House and the Senate, it acceded
last week to the version that came in just under $900 million.
   It is about one-quarter the size of the $3.9 billion relief
package that farmers got to cope with last year's devastating
drought.
   ``This act will help farmers recover after damaging rain and wind
and will see others through a year when they've had to stand by and
watch their crops fail,'' Bush said.
   ``In a number of states from the Dakotas to the Texas Panhandle
and in the mid-Atlantic states as well, farmers have indeed
suffered, and this bill provides relief,'' said Bush. He noted that
winter wheat in Kansas was off by more than 50 percent.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who had hoped for more
aid, said farmers were better off with getting the $900 million now
rather than waiting until September and hoping that Congress could
enact a bigger package.
   On the other hand, Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter said
the administration would have preferred ``a much more limited piece
of legislation.''
   Although a wide range of crop losses will be covered, Yeutter
said the main beneficiaries will be those who lost wheat to the
drought, as well as farmers hit by rains that damaged corn and
soybeans in the eastern corn belt and cotton in the deep South.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee issued a statement hailing the measure and saying,
``Because of Congress' quick work, winter wheat farmers will be able
to receive relief before next month's planting.''
   Farmers who participated in this year's price support program and
purchased crop insurance will be paid at 65 percent of the target
price for any losses beyond 35 percent of normal production.
   Those who were in the program but didn't buy crop insurance will
be compensated for losses beyond 40 percent of their normal
production. Those who were not in the program are eligible only if
their losses exceed 50 percent.
   The new law caps benefits at $100,000 for each producer, and
prohibits payments to those with $2 million or more in gross farm
revenues.
   Bush said he was pleased that ``this law loosens some of the
controls that limit what farmers can plant, leaving more farmers
free then to choose the crops they grow and to diversify
agricultural production.''
   Sen. Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo., said that flexibility will allow
farmers to plant non-traditional crops such as canola, rapeseed and
crambe on up to 20 percent of their base acreage without risking a
loss of future federal farm payments.
   Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden, who also attended the ceremony, said,
``We're very pleased that it could happen as fast as it did. Farmers
have got to be able to get the capital to plant this fall. This gets
the money out there so are producers can get back in the field.''
   Now, the governor added, ``we would just hope that the rain would
come.''

   The body of a trucker was found in a
tractor-trailer rig that sat _ with engine running _ in a parking
lot for nine days, authorities said Monday.
   Lester Peters, 55, of Laurel, Ind., apparently died of carbon
monoxide poisoning, said Joseph Inman, an investigator with the
Lucas County coroner's office.
   No foul play was suspected, Inman said, adding it appeared the
driver fell asleep. An autopsy was planned.
   Peters' decomposed body was found by police Sunday afternoon in
the cab of his tractor-trailor, which had been parked with its
engine running since Aug. 4 in the parking lot of a McDonald's on
the city's north side.
   The truck had enough fuel _ about 200 gallons _ to run for two
weeks. Inman said he didn't know why somebody didn't call police
until Sunday afternoon.
   ``Apparently they swept the parking lot around it. ... I have no
idea why. You would think someone would notice a truck in the
parking lot with its engine running,'' he said.
   The McDonald's manager didn't respond Monday to a telephone
request for comment.
   Peters, who was working for TMC Trucking Co. of Des Moines, Iowa,
picked up a shipment of steel at Heidtman Steel Products, about 1{
miles from the McDonald's, on Aug. 4. He was to take the shipment to
Greenup, Ill., and was expected to arrive Aug. 7, Inman said.
   On Aug. 9, the trucking company notified Peters' wife, Janice,
that he was missing. The family called the police and then launched
its own search of truck stops and rest areas along his planned
route, said Peters' sister, Shirley Combs of Connersville, Ind.
   ``They went everywhere where they thought he might be on the
road, somewhere. They took his picture and posted them in truck
stops and rest areas,'' Ms. Combs said.
   She said said her brother was going to quit his job and start a
truck repair shop. He had been working seven days a week over the
last few months to pay off his new truck and to open the shop.
   She said she found it hard to believe no one called police about
the truck.
   ``People nowadays are just in too big of a rush. They just don't
pay attention to one another,'' she said.

   Bad weather stalled efforts Monday
to recover the bodies of Rep. Mickey Leland and 15 companions from a
mountain ravine in remote southwestern Ethiopia, where their plane
crashed a week ago.
   Heavy clouds and rain forced two Blackhawk helicopters carrying
recovery teams to return to the capital twice before the weather
cleared enough for them to make the 250-mile flight to the crash
site in midafternoon.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman James Haley said they arrived too late to
begin full-scale recovery operations Monday.
   ``We've got people down there and have started taking the
necessary photographs, but we won't begin retrieving bodies until
tomorrow,'' he said.
   Leland, a 44-year-old Texas Democrat who headed the House Select
Committee on Hunger, was on his fifth visit to Africa and his second
this year.
   His chartered plane crashed Aug. 7 en route to Fugnido, one of
four camps in southwestern Ethiopia run by the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. They house more than 300,000 Sudanese who
have fled war and famine in the neighboring country.
   Twelve bodies were found Sunday on the slopes of a mountain where
the Twin Otter crashed on the way to Fugnido, about 350 miles
southwest of Addis Ababa. The small, twin-engine plane apparently
hit a cliff about 1,200 feet below the summit of the 5,500-foot
mountain in bad weather.
   The four missing bodies were believed to be in the wreckage.
Bodies and parts of the plane were strewn over a wide area of the
barely accessible slope, to which searchers had to be lowered from
helicopters on Sunday.
   In Washington, the State Department said Monday that recovery of
the bodies will require at least two days of good weather.
   ``Officials on the scene believe that the recovery will be a slow
and laborious process because of the weather, the rough terrain, and
the steep incline of the slope where the wreckage is located,'' said
spokesman Richard Boucher. He said the wreckage was on a 70-degree
slope.
   Boucher also said Ethiopia has accepted an offer from the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board to investigate the cause of the
crash. He said a team from the NTSB was en route to Ethiopia.
   Haley said the two Blackhawk helicopters would stay overnight at
Gambela, 35 miles southeast of the crash site, and begin retrieval
operations at daybreak. He said they would be joined by two more
Blackhawks with rescue teams, and two C-130 cargo planes carrying
helicopter fuel would leave for the area at dawn.
   After being taken by helicopter to nearby Dembidola village, the
bodies are to be flown by a C-130 to Addis Ababa. Nine Americans and
seven Ethiopians were on the Leland plane.
   The bodies of the Americans are expected to be taken to the
United States later this week on a C-141 hospital plane sent to
Ethiopia last week, according to Navy Capt. Stan Bloyer in
Washington.
   Bloyer said a four-member congressional delegation planned to fly
to Ethiopia to escort the bodies home but would not leave Washington
until the remains had been identified.
   Reps. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., Al Wheat, D-Mo., and the
sergeant-at-arms of the House of Representatives, Jack Russ, left
Ethiopia on Monday, Haley said. They had arrived Friday to observe
the search operation.

<HEAD>Inventories Rise, Sales Dip in June</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of ``economist'' in grafs 3 and 5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

   Business inventories rose 0.4 percent in June
as business sales fell 0.3 percent, the government said Monday.
Analysts said the report was in line with the economic
``soft-landing'' sought by the Federal Reserve Board _ slow but
continued growth with low inflation.
   Inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as
production exceeds demand, a process that sometimes leads to a loss
of jobs as businesses cut their output.
   Economists, however, said recent inventory-to-sales ratios are
not unusually high.
   ``Inventories are not out of hand yet,'' said Howard Roth of
Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles.
   ``The basic message is that inventory vulnerability is fairly
limited in the economy,'' commented Robert G. Dederick, chief
economist for The Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. ``This suggests
that the prospect of an outright recession is limited.''
   Inventories held on shelves and backlots climbed to a seasonally
adjusted $780.8 billion in June, the Commerce Department said. The
0.4 percent jump followed increases of 0.9 percent in May and 0.8
percent in April.
   Business sales, meanwhile, fell 0.3 percent to a seasonally
adjusted $516.4 billion after rising 0.1 percent in May and 2
percent in April, the department said. Sales had last fallen in
February, when they were down 0.9 percent.
   The June report was consistent with recent indicators that
economic growth had slowed as the Federal Reserve tightened credit
to restrain inflation.
   In a report Friday, the Labor Department said wholesale prices
one step short of retail had fallen 0.4 percent in July, their
biggest decline in three years. At the same time, the Commerce
Department reported that retail sales in July had risen a strong 0.9
percent after falling 0.1 percent in June.
   Roth said the July retail sales report means ``we'll probably
have pretty strong (business) sales in next report. As far as the
economy is concerned, it looks like the soft-landing scenario is
still pretty good.''
   Monday's business sales report includes transactions at three
levels _ manufacturing, wholesale and retail.
   The ratio of inventories to sales in June was 1.51, meaning it
would take 1.51 months to exhaust inventories at the June sales
pace. The ratio had stood at 1.50 in May and 1.49 in April
   Manufacturers' inventories, which represent 47 percent of the
total, rose 0.3 percent, while retailers' stocks were up 0.6
percent. Wholesalers registered a 0.1 percent increase.
   Total inventories were 8.2 percent higher than in June 1988.
   Manufacturers' sales, on the other hand, fell 0.5 percent.
Wholesalers' sales were off 0.3 percent while retailers' sales were
down 0.1 percent.
   Overall, sales were up 6.2 percent from a year ago.

<HEAD>Highlights of Farm Disaster Relief Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: ADDs 3 grafs on when program will go into effect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are provisions of the farm disaster relief
bill signed by President Bush.
   The new law:
   _Authorizes an estimated $897 million in federal payments for
farmers suffering crop losses from 35 percent to 50 percent this
year because of weather-related disasters ranging from drought to
flooding. Assistance also would go for replanting fruit trees killed
by freeze and to small commercial growers who lose trees from
drought and wildfires this year.
   _Provides payments covering 65 percent of a farmer's projected
lost income from the crop damage. In most instances, the income
levels will be based on federal crop subsidies or average market
prices farmers would have received had they not suffered losses.
   _Expands existing emergency livestock feed and water programs to
provide more assistance for producers facing drought-related
shortages for their herds. For example, the law will make money
available to farmers to provide water for livestock raised in
confinement facilities, and to build or deepen ponds used to water
livestock.
   _Caps benefits at $100,000 for each producer, and prohibits
payments to those with $2 million or more in gross farm revenues.
   _Requires farmers who received disaster assistance to buy federal
crop insurance in 1990 if their losses this year exceeded 65 percent.
   Here are the different eligibility standards under the new law:
   _Producers of wheat, corn, cotton, rice and other feed grains
participating in federal commodity programs, and who purchased
federal crop insurance, would be eligible for assistance on losses
above 35 percent.
   _Farmers without crop insurance, but growing the so-called
program crops, must suffer losses of at least 40 percent. Tobacco,
peanuts and sugar beets are treated as program crops.
   _Soybean and sunflower farmers would be eligible for assistance
if they suffered losses above 45 percent, regardless of whether they
purchased crop insurance.
   _Most crops not covered by government commodity programs,
everything from cherries and peaches to dry edible beans and
potatoes, must suffer losses exceeding 50 percent.
   _The same 50 percent loss requirement would apply to farmers who
are not enrolled in federal commodity programs but grow wheat, corn,
grain sorghum and other so-called program crops.
   The Agriculture Department said it soon will publish regulations
to carry out the program and inform state and county offices of the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service of how it works.
   The law requires the program to be phased in over the next 45
days, spokesman Ray Waggoner noted.
   He said livestock producers, winter wheat farmers and others
should be able to figure losses quickly from crops already
harvested, while more time will be needed to tally the losses from
corn, soybeans and other crops being harvested in the fall.

<HEAD>Estonia, Azerbaijan Plagued by Strikes, Unrest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Estonia's Communist Party chief called Monday for
Russian workers in his republic to end a six-day strike and
negotiate differences.
   Unrest flared in the southern republic of Azerbaijan, meanwhile,
with thousands of people holding a rally and saying they would
concentrate their strike on key industries.
   Strike leaders in Estonia's capital of Tallinn said at least
20,000 Russian workers stayed off the job to protest a new law that
tightens residency requirements for voters and candidates.
   ``We met with strike committee representatives and they later
said they were not satisfied with the results. If so, let's continue
the talks,'' party chief Vaino Vyalyas said in an Estonian TV
interview.
   State-run Moscow Radio said the strike cost millions of dollars.
   It said the Estonian law will take the right to vote away from
more than 100,000 non-Estonians in the republic of 1.6 million
people.
   The new law limits voting to residents who have lived in the same
district for two years, or anywhere in Estonia for five years.
Candidates must live in the same place for five years, or in Estonia
for 10 years.
   Strike committee member Alexei Kutenyov said by telephone that
work had at least partially halted at 46 of the republic's
businesses, mainly in Tallinn and in the mining town of
Kohtla-Jarve. Tass said about 20 businesses in Tallinn and 10 in
Kohtla-Jarve were affected.
   Cargo railcars were piling up at Tallinn stations because train
workers were on strike, and the state airline Aeroflot was carrying
only emergency supplies and passengers, the labor daily Trud said.
   Vyalyas admitted the rights of Estonia's minorities, whom he did
not identify but presumably including Russians, had not been taken
into account. ``This is our mistake and it must be corrected,'' he
said.
   The striking Russians, most of whom work in industrial plants,
also object to a new national decision to give Estonia free rein
over its economy. The workers are demanding that factories with a
predominantly Russian-speaking labor force remain the property of
the national government rather than be handed over to Estonia.
   In Azerbaijan, an estimated 10,000-15,000 people demonstrated in
the capital of Baku on Monday night and decided to make their strike
that began earlier in the day more selective, said activist Aidin
Amirbekov.
   Amirbekov, a member of the People's Front of Azerbaijan that
called the strike, said the protesters decided to concentrate the
walkout on vital industries such as an oil processing equipment
plant, while returning to work in light industry, which produces
consumer goods.
   Amirbekov said by telephone from Baku that one of the strikers'
demands is that the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh be
returned to Azerbaijan. The Kremlin placed the region under its
authority in January.
   Predominantly Shiite Moslem Azerbaijan has been embroiled in a
dispute with neighboring Armenia, whose population is mainly
Christian, over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but its population is
predominantly Armenian, and Armenia wants to annex it.
   Armenians have been striking in Nagorno-Karabakh for four months,
and ethnic violence, including use of home-made bombs, has
continued, Tass said Monday. Last year, nearly 100 people were
killed in Armenia and Azerbaijan in violence stemming from the
territorial dispute.
   ``Loss of life and the number of casualties among the Armenian
and Azerbaijani population and servicemen is growing,'' the news
agency said, without providing details.
   The region has been blockaded, with transportation disrupted by
extremists who are sabotaging highways and railways, Tass said.
   Food is reaching the region only because soldiers are guarding
shipments and ``the population is in constant fear,'' the news
agency reported.
   Political problems also are severe it said, adding that ``there
are unconstitutional attempts to create an alternative structure of
government bodies, calls for civil disobedience, for outright armed
struggle.''
   Senior Interior Ministry officials are helping local authorities
``take additional measures to prevent unlawful actions, cut short
acts of sabotage, interethnic clashes and mass disturbances, to
ensure safety of people,'' Tass said. It did not say what new action
was taken.
   In Baku, an editor said workers walked out Monday at six
factories: an oil equipment plant, a steel plant, a sewing factory
and three smaller machine-tool works.
   Of Baku's estimated 1 million workers, perhaps 1 percent joined
the stoppage, said Saveli Peretz, deputy chief of Azerinform, the
official Azerbaijani news agency.
   ``It's a very small number,'' Peretz said by telephone.

Botha's resignation speech, delivered in Afrikaans on national

South African Press Association:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   This morning, I had discussions lasting a few hours with members
of the Cabinet about my point of view. They all had their
opportunity of putting forward their point of view. With their
permission, a tape recording was made of the proceedings.
   Arising from their meeting on Saturday in Pretoria, they proposed
to me that I should depart for my private residence and appoint an
acting state president until after Sept. 6.
   I asked them what reason I could offer for such a step. They
replied that I could use my health as an excuse.
   To this I replied that I am not prepared to leave on a lie and I
have consequently decided to submit my resignation to the chief
justice today with effect from 15 August 1989.
   It is evident to me that after all these years of my best efforts
for the National Party and for the government of this country as
well as the security of our country, I am being ignored by ministers
serving in my Cabinet. I consequently have no choice other than to
announce my resignation.
   I thank the thousands of friends of South Africa of all language
groups who, through the years, have shown their goodwill toward me
and my wife. We leave this post with memories of friendship and
loyalty. ...

<TEXT>
   Unwanted children carry their emotional
neediness into young adulthood, according to a study of a group
whose mothers tried twice to abort them, a researcher said Monday.
   At ages 21 to 23, the unwanted children showed greater risk of
problems than a matched sample of other children, said Henry P.
David, a Maryland researcher who did the study in Czechoslovakia. At
least one American psychiatrist questioned the study's credibility.
   The problems included greater proneness to drug and alcohol abuse
or crime, less job satisfaction, more conflict with co-workers and
supervisors, less satisfaction with friends and more disappointments
in love, David said.
   A larger proportion had their first sexual intercourse before age
15 and had sexual relations with more than 10 partners, David said.
   Among married people, the unwanted group more often judged their
marriages to be less happy, and significantly more often said they
wished they were not married or not married to their current partner.
   David is the director of the Transnational Family Research
Institute in Bethesda, Md., a non-profit organization that studies
reproductive behavior.
   He described the work at a news conference at the annual meeting
of the American Psychological Associatioe percentage with a stepfather,
said Nigro, who is president
of a local physicians group that opposes abortion.
   David, in a statement distributed at the press conference, said
the children were matched for age, sex, school class, birth order
and number of siblings. But some three-child families had to be
matched with two-child families, the statement said.
   Mothers were matched for age, socioeconomic status and the
presence of a husband or partner in the home, the statement said.
   The study tracked 220 people born in 1961 to 1963 whose mothers
had twice sought to abort them, and compared them to 220 children
whose mothers had wanted or at least accepted their pregnancies.
   The denied abortions were blocked by Czech authorities who ruled
on abortion requests, David said. That power has since been
abolished, partly as a result of the study, David said.
   The study also found evidence of more problems among unwanted
childeren at ages 9 and 14 to 16, David said.

<HEAD>School Tries Going Without Principal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILL CITY, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There hasn't been a principal running the
Hill City school since last year, and the district is not even
looking for one.
   A committee of teachers runs the school, with supervision from
the district superintendent, as part of a three-year experiment that
takes teacher-power to a new level.
   The idea of giving more power to teachers, sometimes known as
site-based management or shared decision-making, is being widely
advocated by school reformers, and rural schools have been known to
share or do without a principal to save money. But only one other
district in Minnesota has gone as far as Hill City in letting
teachers run a school outright.
   ``It's not perfect, but ... I think if you were to go in the
building and ask if morale is better, they'd say yes,'' said Linda
Bauer, a counselor and teacher on Hill City's ``share team.''
   ``People here have the chance to express their opinions and
views. We use the strengths of all people on the staff _ bus
drivers, cooks, people who have a unique perspective on what's going
on in a student's life.''
   Hill City's school has about 330 students in kindergarten to
grade 12. The ``share team,'' about to begin its second year of
managing the school, has two elementary teachers, two secondary
teachers and the school secretary. Teachers are paid roughly $4,400
extra for the team work.
   Last year, the team met daily for about 45 minutes before school
and had regular weekly meetings lasting about 2{ hours. The
secretary made many decisions about such things as office supplies,
and one team member was free each day to function as a
quasi-principal.
   Not everyone in this north-central Minnesota community of 360,
and the rural area around it that also sends children to its school,
has been happy with the experiment. Vernon Bishop, a new school
board member, said parents have been frustrated with the lack of a
principal and some believe the system jeopardizes confidentiality.
   ``I'm willing to give this a chance,'' he said. ``(But) for
parents I have talked to, it's a real big concern.''
   Superintendent Darrell Nelson said some parents don't like the
fact that substitute teachers fill in for the team members when they
are doing management duties.
   Richard Mesenberg, manager of the state Department of Education's
Office of Educational Leadership, says he doesn't recommend the Hill
City system because sometimes committees can't make decisions.
   But in general, Mesenberg said, parent and teacher involvement in
school decisions is the first part of a long-term change in American
education. ``We're making schools fundamentally different than they
were yesterday,'' he said.
   State officials estimate 25 to 30 of Minnesota's 435 school
districts are seriously involved in some form of decentralized
management.
   ``There is no model, and that frustrates people,'' said Ted Suss,
administrator for the State Board of Education. But fostering a
model for local schools to follow would undo the very reason for
decentralization in the first place, he said.
   Two of the state's biggest school districts, Minneapolis and St.
Paul, are set to begin organized efforts this fall to give schools
more local control. Winona, enrollment 4,600, has one of the state's
oldest programs. The district's 10 regular schools have had ``school
site councils'' with teachers and principals for five years.

<TEXT>
   The State Department sharply condemned Syria
and its allies Monday for the eruption of large-scale ground
fighting in Lebanon and said the turmoil makes U.S. efforts to gain
the release of American hostages more difficult.
   There was no indication, however, that the Bush administration
was preparing any new diplomatic initiative to try to force the
warring factions to the negotiating table. Instead, the State
Department again deferred to the Arab League as being in the best
position to seek a settlement in the 14-year civil war between
Muslim and Christian forces.
   The condemnation of Syria, whose hold on Lebanese territory
appears to be expanding, was delivered by spokesman Richard Boucher
at the department's daily press briefing.
   An official who requested anonymity said the U.S. concern had
been conveyed to the Syrians ``in recent meetings in Damascus.''
   Boucher told reporters that ``Syria-supported forces have joined
the latest round of fighting in Lebanon.
   ``This represents an irresponsible escalation of the violence.
Syria and its allies should refrain from any further escalation and
accept immediately international and Arab League calls for a
cease-fire and a lifting of the blockade'' of Christian ports.
   At the same time, Boucher urged the Christians to observe a
cease-fire and to join in the ``political reconstruction'' of the
country. This means, in effect, agreeing to power-sharing
arrangements with Muslims that would reduce Christian Maronite
influence in the country.
   The United States has turned to Syria, as well as a number of
other parties including the Soviet Union, in the latest effort to
free the eight Americans believed to be held hostage in southern
Lebanon.
   But Boucher said that ``clearly the unsettled situation in Beirut
makes the situation regarding the hostages more difficult.'' He did
not elaborate.
   In the past, Syria has played an occasionally helpful role on
behalf of captive Americans and earned U.S. expressions of
gratitude. It has also been the target of now-lifted sanctions
imposed after the State Department concluded that Damascus had
supported terrorism.
   Apart from its dominant position in Lebanon, Syria is the only
major Arab ally of Iran. Shiite supporters of Iran are believed to
be holding all the American hostages.
   Large-scale ground fighting over the weekend carried the latest,
five-month spate of violence in Lebanon to bloodier heights. Muslim
and leftist militia aligned with Syria mounted an offensive near Suk
al Gharb, eight miles east of Beirut, and broke through the defense
lines of Christian forces led by Gen. Michael Aoun.
   Iraq, an implacable foe of Syria, is aiding the Christians in
their faltering attempts to stem the Muslim advance.
   Boucher, in response to a question, reiterated U.S. support for
the territorial integrity of Lebanon. Asked what the Bush
administration might do next if Syria did not relent, the U.S.
official said:
   ``We have to see where we go next. That's a job for the whole
international community.''
   He said the United States was engaged in a ``broad-based effort''
to support peace-making efforts of the U.N. Security Council and
France, as well as of the Arab League.
   ``We are actively involved,'' Boucher said. But, he repeated,
``the Arab League is in the best position to bring about some
solution to the problems of Lebanon.''

   Syrian troops were reported massing near
an important Christian garrison Monday for what the Christians
feared would be a new attempt to break through their defenses. New
artillery duels killed eight people.
   A police spokesman and sources in Gen. Michel Aoun's army said
the Syrians were assembling troops and armor in the central
mountains at Douar, east of Beirut.
   Douar is 11 miles from another strategic Christian position that
was attacked Sunday in the first ground assault since the latest
fighting broke out in March between Syrian and Christian forces.
   ``The Syrians are bringing in T-62 tanks and dozens of mortars of
various calibers to positions overlooking Douar,'' said an Aoun
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Sources at Aoun's headquarters said the Syrian National Socialist
Party, a Damascus ally, was joining in the troop buildup at Douar,
along the main road that leads through the mountains from the
Syrian-held Bekaa Valley.
   The party, composed mainly of Greek Orthodox fighters hostile to
the Maronite Catholics who dominate the Christian camp, previously
has stayed out of the fighting.
   Syrian-backed Palestinian radicals joined the fighting for the
first time Sunday when they helped attack the Christian stronghold
of Souk el-Gharb.
   A Syrian military spokesman in Damascus denied Syrian forces were
involved in the assault on Souk el-Gharb, but Aoun's headquarters
said the Syrians threw most of their 41st Brigade into the battle.
   Police said 70 attackers, including 25 Syrians, were killed in
the battle and that four defenders were killed.
   Souk el-Gharb was heavily shelled again Monday, and Aoun's aides
said the Christians were bracing for another assault.
   ``We're ready to take them on again,'' an Aoun aide said as
mortar and tank fire hit the one-time resort, which was abandoned by
civilians six years ago.
   The mountaintop garrison, under siege by Syrian-backed Moslem
forces since 1983, controls a network of roads that twist through
Lebanon's central range into the Christian enclave, which fans out
north of Beirut.
   Syrian gunners shelled the enclave again Monday. Police said
eight people were killed and 66 wounded, bringing the casualty toll
since the duels began March 8 to 741 dead and 1,950 wounded.
   At least 37 civilians were killed and 120 wounded between
midnight Saturday and midnight Sunday.
   In Washington, the State Department sharply condemned Syria and
its allies in connection with the ground fighting in Lebanon and
said the bloodshed makes U.S. efforts to gain the release of
American hostages more difficult.
   Department spokesman said Richard Boucher said, ``Syria and its
allies should refrain from any further escalation and accept
immediately international and Arab League calls for a cease-fire and
a lifting of the blockade'' of Christian ports.
   He also called on the Christians to observe a cease-fire and to
join in the ``political reconstruction'' of the country.
   The fighting, which broke out after Aoun blockaded illegal
militia-run ports, has left much of Beirut in ruins. More than 85
percent of the city's 1.5 million people have fled.
   In the Barbir district of Moslem west Beirut, one of the
worst-hit neighborhoods, cars smoldered in streets carpeted with
broken glass and rubble.
   In Ras al-Nabaa, virtually every building was damaged. Alleyways
were blocked by crumbled buildings. Broken power cables dangled from
splintered poles.
   Rescue teams used a lull in the fighting to pull civilians from
wrecked, burned out buildings. Many buildings still smoldered
because fire crews were unable to reach them.
   Dazed Beirutis emerged from their shelters. Some had been
underground for three or four days. Long lines formed outside the
few bakeries that opened. Sandbagged supermarkets were crowded.
   ``This is sadism,'' said Ali Shaker, a history professor at the
American University of Beirut. ``Beirut has been murdered. But the
murderer is not satisfied. He is mutilating its corpse, piece by
piece.''
   Aoun said Monday he was determined to drive the 40,000 Syrian
troops from Lebanon and that a truce would achieve nothing.
   ``Syria only understands the language of force,'' he said in an
interview with France's RTL radio. ``We must make Syria leave
Lebanon by force. A cease-fire is not a national objective.''
   The Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate, but Aoun said they betrayed that mandate by
siding with the Moslems in the 14-year-old civil war and declared a
``war of liberation'' against them.
   But Aoun's 20,000 soldiers are heavily outgunned and outnumbered
by the Syrians and their allies, who can muster abourt 60,000
fighters.
   Monday's bombardment began with sporadic Syrian salvoes around
dawn after an 11-hour overnight lull. It intensified by midday into
sustained barrages on Christian east Beirut and north along the
coast.
   Aoun's guns retaliated against Syrian gun positions in and around
west Beirut.
   Police said the hilltop presidential palace in Christian east
Beirut, where Aoun has an underground headquarters bunker, was
repeatedly hit by Syrian mortars and rockets. A spokesman said Aoun
and his aides were safe.

   Four armed fugitives holding three
people hostage in an armored car agreed Saturday to exchange their
captives for a pilot and airplane to fly them to Paraguay, officials
reported.
   The kidnappers were identified as two married couples who earlier
obtained a $42,000 ransom to free a nine-year-old boy they had
abudcted. They accepted the offer of a plane in place of a
helicopter they had demanded earlier and ``promised to release the
three hostages unharmed,'' the Sao Paulo State Security Department
said.
   ``The plane has landed on the highway where the armored car is
located and is refueling now,'' Security Department spokesman Jairo
Pires told The Associated Press by telephone. ``They (the fugitives)
agreed to board the plane fully armed and then release the three
hostages.''
   An earlier plan to provide a helicopter for the kidnappers'
getaway fell through when the pilots of the only two helicopters in
the area in south-centeral Brazil refused to fly the kidnappers
unless they first surrendered their arms.
   Pires said a local rancher from the city of Presidente Prudente
who alsi os a pilot volunteered to fly the fugitives to Paraguay in
a six-seat plene. Presidente Purdente is near the site of the
standoff and 636 miles southwest$
   The rancher volunteered to make the flight ``when negotiations
were at a critical impasse.''
   He gave no further details and declined to say when the exchange
might be made and the plane could takeoff.
   Police said the helicoter pilots refused the mission because the
kidnappers demanded that they be allowed to take with them grenades,
a submachine gun, pistols and shotguns .
   ``We have no idea where the plane may be going,'' Osmar Saraiva,
a duty officer at the Presidente Prudente police precinct said in a
phone interview. ``It has a fuel capacity of four-and-a half hours,
time enough to go anywhere.''
   Pires said the hostages _ two television reporters and the driver
of the armored car _ were in fair physical condition. The armored
car has been surrounded by about 100 police, including
shasrpshooters, since early Friday.
   The kidnappers began their crime spree on Aug. 3 when they
abducted a boy from his home in Goiania, 852 miles northwest of Rio.
   
   Six days after the kidnapping, police found the house on the
outskirts of Goiania where the two couples were holding the boy.
Police exchanged the boy for $42,000, the armored car, a driver, and
three local television reporters.
   After releasing one of the reporters, the kidnappers headed for
the Goiania Airport, where authorities refused to provide an
airplane in exchange the hostages.
   The armored car then sped off on a 500-mile jaunt through three
states with the police close behind. During one stop at a roadside
cafe, one kidnapper stepped out of the armored car and held a pistol
to a hostage's head.
   The chase ended early Friday when the kidnappers stopped on a
highway near Presidente Prudente, 635 miles southwest of Rio, and
demanded a helicopter in exchange for their three hostages.
   An Air Force helicopter was summoned from Brasilia to the
Presidente Prudente Airport and a private helicopter arrived later,
Jairo Pires, spokesman for the Sao Paulo State Security Department,
said by telephone.
   But a 3 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT) deadline set by the kidnappers passed
when the helicopter pilots refused to fly the couples unless they
surrendered their grenades, machine gun and two shotguns.
   About 100 heavily armed police continued to surround the armored
car and sharpshooters aimed their rifles at the vehicle's small
windows.
   The three local television reporters who volunteered to take the
boy's place at the beginning of the drama were identified as Solange
Franco, Monica Calassa and Carla Monteiro. The kidnappers later
released Monteiro.
   The standoff was the third in four months in which criminals took
hostages.
   In early July, six heavily armed men hijacked a packed passenger
bus in the northeastern state of Bahia after an unsuccessful bank
robbery attempt.
   After being chased 200 miles across the back woods of
northeastern Brazil with three hostages, police shot and killed
three of the fugitives.
   In April, three bank robbers in a remote northeastern town robbed
a bank, took five hostages and fled by plane 1,200 miles to the
Amazon.

   Police shot and killed a machete-wielding man after
a 2{-hour standoff Monday as television cameras recorded the
incident.
   Neighbors called police after Rolando Rodriguez, 59, threatened
them with a knife, police spokesman David Rivero said.
   Rodriguez's family said he had a history of mental problems, and
sought and received a court order for his arrest Monday, the officer
said.
   After efforts to negotiate his surrender failed, Rodriguez
emerged from his house swinging a machete at SWAT team officers who
had reached the porch.
   ``The officer gave him one chance,'' Rivero said, but Rodriguez
ducked back into the house. ``He came back out again, trying to
throw the knife at the officer, and that's when they shot him.''
   Officer Frank Fernandez, a four-year veteran, was only a few feet
from Rodriguez when he fired his service pistol directly into his
chest. Rodriguez fell, rolling down the porch. He was rushed to
Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
   ``He was shot through the heart, in the aorta,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Ann Prospero.
   Rivero said the shooting appeared justified but called it sad.
``It's a very unfortunate incident because it involves somebody who
had psychological problems,'' he said.

<HEAD>White House Softens Sting of Darman's Criticism of Federal Reserve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's spokesman on Monday praised
the Federal Reserve's ``good job'' on the national economy, seeking
to soften the sting from an attack on Fed policy by Bush's budget
director.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that the
administration was seeking ``continued economic growth with low
inflation. We believe the economy is generally on that course at the
present time and the Fed is doing a good job.''
   But at the same time, Fitzwater did not repudiate the statements
made on Sunday by Budget Director Richard Darman. Fitzwater noted
that Bush has made similar comments himself in the past.
   Darman, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said the Fed was
keeping interest rates too high and would shoulder the blame if the
country falls into a recession.
   Saying he feared the Fed ``may have been a little too tight,''
Darman urged the central bank to do more to lower interest rates and
said the Fed should ``be more attentive to the need to avoid tipping
the economy into a recession.''
   Private economists were surprised by the timing of Darman's
remarks, given the fact that recent economic statistics suggest
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan may be succeeding in his
effort to achieve a ``soft landing'' in which economic growth slows
enough to dampen inflationary pressures without pitching the country
into a recession.
   Some analysts suggested that Darman was positioning the Federal
Reserve to take the blame should the economy falter before next
year's congressional elections.
   ``This is a classic situation of setting up the Fed to be the
fall guy if something goes wrong,'' said Robert Dederick, chief
economist at Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   Economists said it was unlikely that Darman's remarks would have
any impact on upcoming Fed decisions. Top Fed policymakers will meet
again in Washington on Aug. 22 and many economists said they
expected the central bank to hold interest rates steady and not ease
further.
   From March 1988 through March 1989, the Federal Reserve pushed
short-term interest rates up by about 3 percentage points in an
effort to dampen economic growth as a way of cooling inflationary
pressures. Starting in June, the Fed reversed course and has made a
modest effort to lower interest rates in order to keep the economy
from tumbling into a recession.
   Those moves, which have made more money available to the banking
system, have allowed banks to cut their prime lending rate since
early June by a full percentage point to 10.5 percent currently.
Home mortgage rates have declined as well to the lowest levels in
two years.
   But with recent signs that economic growth is not as sluggish as
feared, many analysts said they were not looking for the Fed to push
interest rates lower in the near future.
   ``So long as the economy is OK, there is no reason for the Fed to
ease any more,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Sinai said mortgage rates may even climb by about one-fourth
percentage point as financial markets realize that the central bank
has decided to hold off on further easing moves.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said that
Darman's comments had made it more difficult for the Fed to ease
right away because the independent central bank would appear to be
bowing to political pressure, a situation which rattles financial
markets.
   ``I don't think the Fed has the political option to ease right
now after Darman's broadside,'' Evans said.
   Paul Getman, senior economist at the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., consulting firm, suggested that Darman may have felt compelled
to attack the Fed because of the just-signed legislation bailing out
the savings and loan industry.
   That measure projects spending $166 billion through 1999 to close
or merge failing S&amp;Ls, an estimate which could balloon if interest
rate assumptions used by the administration turn out to be too
optimistic.
   ``The administration's forecast of the bailout is predicated on
low interest rates. Darman knows that,'' Getman said.
   Darman's comments marked the first critical administration
statements since last winter when Bush and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady both complained that the Fed's year-long effort to
push interest rates higher ran the risk of aborting the record
peacetime expansion, now in its seventh year.

<TEXT>
   Columbia sustained only
minor damage to its heat-shield tiles during its first flight in 3{
years and had slight equipment problems during the secret military
mission, NASA said Monday.
   A steering thruster failed and the pilot's seat suddenly jerked
backward during launch, but none of the problems is considered
serious, said a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
spokeswoman.
   Columbia ``looks absolutely beautiful'' after its five-day,
one-hour classified mission, said Ann Montgomery, in charge of
processing the shuttle.
   Columbia landed at this Mojave Desert military base Sunday
morning after its mission to deploy a satellite, which experts have
said is a modified KH-12 spy satellite designed to photograph
military targets. The astronauts also reportedly performed
experiments related to the ``Star Wars'' anti-missile defense system.
   ``It was a very clean flight, so we didn't have a lot of
problems,'' Montgomery said.
   She said Columbia probably will leave here Saturday for a two-day
piggyback flight back to Cape Canaveral, Fla., atop a modified
Boeing 747 jetliner.
   When Columbia was launched from Florida last Tuesday, pilot
Richard Richards' seat jerked backward about one inch, but the
malfunction caused no problems, Montgomery said.
   ``It was exciting when it happened,'' but Richards used a motor
control to move the seat forward to its normal position ``and it
stayed,'' she added.
   The shuttle's commander and pilot actually do very little during
the spacecraft's liftoff, which is almost entirely controlled by
computers.
   A leaky in-flight steering thruster will need replacing, but
Columbia's crew shut it down during the flight and used other
thrusters, Montgomery said.
   Only three of the shuttle's roughly 30,000 heat-shielding tiles
were damaged enough to require replacement, based on initial
inspection, she said. A more detailed inspection was underway Monday.
   Two of the tiles are on the bottom of the orbiter and may have
been gouged when yet-unidentified debris fell from the shuttle when
it was launched, she added. The third damaged tile, which was
chipped, is located on the main landing gear door.
   Montgomery said workers will examine about 20 other minor
potential problems that developed just before or during Columbia's
flight, including some instrument glitches and failure of a thruster
heater and a nozzle that dumps water from the orbiter.
   Columbia's brakes and landing gear were in such good shape that
they didn't need to be removed before the shuttle was towed off the
hard clay runway on which it landed _ only the second time that has
happened, she said.
   Montgomery said she didn't know why Columbia appeared dirty, but
indicated the discolorations were heat streaks caused during
re-entry.
   Columbia's mission brought the shuttle fleet back up to three
orbiters. Columbia is the oldest. It last flew in January 1986,
landing 10 days before Challenger exploded after liftoff, killing
seven crew members. After the accident NASA concentrated on making
safety modifications to the two newer shuttles, Discovery and
Atlantis, before refurbishing Columbia.
   Columbia is scheduled to be launched again Dec. 18 to deploy a
Navy communications satellite and retrieve a bus-sized scientific
satellite that will fall to Earth within several months if not
plucked from its decaying orbit.
   The next shuttle flight is scheduled for Oct. 12, when Atlantis
will carry the Galileo space probe into Earth orbit so it can be
launched on a six-year voyage to Jupiter.

   Sinhalese extremists called for a
one-day general strike Tuesday to demand withdrawal of Indian
peacekeeping soldiers.
   Military officials said Monday that 14 more people were killed in
the island's ethnic violence.
   The killings were reported around central and southern Sri Lanka,
where members of the majority ethnic Sinhalese dominate, on Sunday
and Monday, military officials said.
   The strike was called to coincide with India's independence day.
The anti-government People's Liberation Front announced the strike
through posters and leaflets in the capital and its suburbs.
   The Sinhalese-language posters warned people to stay indoors.
Several earlier strikes called by the front have been largely
successful.
   Monday's posters denounced the presence of an estimated 43,000
Indian soldiers.
   The soldiers were deployed in the northeast to oversee a 1987
peace accord that aimed to end an ethnic Tamil insurrection for an
independent nation.
   The ultra-nationalist front says the presence of Indian troops
compromises the country's sovereignty. It also says the government
is making too many concessions to the Tamil militants, who began
their separatist campaign in 1983.
   The Tamils say they suffer discrimination from Sinhalese, who
make up 75 percent of the population.Tamils comprise 18 percent of
Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa has asked India to withdraw its
soldiers, but the results have failed to appease the extremists.
   India has pulled out 2,220 soldiers since Premadasa made the
request June 1 but says a quick withdrawal of all troops could lead
to more violence.
   Instead, it has said it will withdraw its soldiers in phases,
pulling them all out by February.
   The government accuses the front of killing at least 4,000 people
during the last two years. About 11,000 other people have died in
the 6-year-old Tamil revolt.
   With the latest killings, the toll in the extremist violence
since Saturday rose to 72, the military officials said.

<HEAD>Six Members of East German Opera Reportedly Defect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six members of East Germany's leading opera company
have defected in London after a two-week tour and are expected to
settle in West Germany, it was reported said Monday.
   The Daily Express newspaper said the six members of Komische
Oper, including singers and technicians, slipped away from a hotel
hours before the 320-member company was due to fly back to East
Berlin on Sunday.
   Officials at Covent Garden's Royal Opera House, the West German
Embassy and the British Home Office, which deals with asylum
requests, all said they knew nothing of the reported defections.
   East German Embassy spokesman Manfred Rudolph refused comment.
   The Daily Express said the six were staying at ``safe houses'' in
London.
   It quoted a lighting engineer, Fred Spodzieja, as saying he
wanted to get to the West ``to be free'' and to join his girlfriend
who fled to West Germany last year.
   ``There are so many reasons. But the main one is I want to be
free. I don't like the Berlin Wall. I want to be in the West,'' the
paper quoted Spodzieja, 41, as saying.
   The Komische Oper, on its first visit to London, was acclaimed by
critics and audiences and played to packed houses. Its performances
included ``Orpheus'' and ``Eurydice'' in modern dress.
   A West German embassy spokesman said the six had not contacted
the embassy.
   However, a BBC-TV report showed a man who it identified as
Spodzeija outside the embassy on Monday. He was shown smiling, but
said nothing.
   West Germany embassy spokesman Bruno Weber said was no need for
any East German defectors to contact the embassy because they had an
automatic right to settle in West Germany. They could simply fly to
West Germany from London.
   ``They basic law says Germans have to the right to travel freely
in Germany. They are our compatriots,'' said Weber.

   About 150 people kept vigil Monday at the
site of the Woodstock concert on the eve of the legendary event's
20th anniversary, police said.
   Police said campers on the farm once owned by Max Yasgur were
quietly milling about Monday as people strummed guitars, bought food
from vendors and watched movies on videocassette recorders powered
by portable generators.
   ``It's very quiet and orderly. No problems,'' Sullivan County
Sheriff Joseph Wasser said.
   Wasser said police have been keeping watch around the clock since
Saturday, but there have been no incidents or arrests.
   A mixture of original festival-goers and other people _ some not
even born when the original concert was held Aug. 15-17, 1969 _ have
been camping out since Saturday at the site of the festival that
drew about 400,000 people.
   The 500 or so people who showed up at the field Saturday found at
least one thing the same from 20 years ago _ the weather. Rain
discouraged revelers and by Sunday only about 200 people were
camping on the farm now owned by Charley and Debbie Gelish.
   The weather improved Monday, police said.
   Wasser said police expected more people to arrive through the
rest of the week in the tiny Sullivan County town of about 3,000,
but not too many.
   ``It's not like we're expecting an onslaught,'' Wasser said.
   Still, roads near the site had been converted to one-way to
improve traffic flow and will stay that way until Sunday, Wasser
said.
   While Bethel is planning no official remembrance on Woodstock's
20th anniversary, the Imperial resort hotel in Swan Lake is staging
a ``Remember Woodstock'' concert Aug. 17-19 featuring such Woodstock
alumni as Bert Sommer, Melanie and John Sebastian.

   P.W. Botha practiced
finger-wagging, confrontational politics for more than 50 years, and
ultimately it cost him the support of even his staunchest allies in
the ruling National Party.
   Nicknamed the ``Great Crocodile'' for his feared temper and
sometimes ruthless manner, Botha has served as head of government
for 11 rocky years.
   ``He has a gift for making enemies as other men have a gift for
friendship,'' newspaper editor Ken Owen once wrote.
   Botha liked to depict himself as the first South African leader
to pursue race reform, but he tenaciously defended the framework of
apartheid while leading South Africa through its worst racial
violence and deepest international isolation.
   Botha's foremost loyalties were to his fellow Afrikaners, yet his
moves to extend limited political power to non-whites split the
white tribe, prompting a mass defection of hard-line segregationists
from the National Party in 1982.
   Within the anti-apartheid movement, Botha was reviled but rarely
underestimated. As prime minister and later as president, his
unpredictable blend of reform and repression kept militant activists
off balance and enabled his government to maintain political and
military dominance despite sanctions, unrest and guerrilla attacks.
   Botha was in unquestioned control of the government until he
suffered a stroke Jan. 18.
   A week later, while still recuperating, he resigned as leader of
the National Party and was replaced by Education Minister F.W. de
Klerk, a man Botha did not support.
   Botha, 73, appears to have recovered from his stroke, but not
from his loss of political control.
   He wanted to stay on as president, ostensibly above party
politics, but the National Party caucus made it clear in March it
preferred that he step down immediately. He went on national
television to reject the suggestion, but was forced to agree to
retirement after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections.
   His bitterness became more obvious as he abruptly refused to
attend a farewell banquet held in his honor by the party he had
served for 54 years. Then he appeared unannounced at a provincial
party congress, requiring de Klerk to give up his seat at the head
table.
   His meeting with imprisoned African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela was praised, but it added to the growing impression
that he was capable of any unpredictable act to embarrass de Klerk.
   Botha found it necessary to announce: ``I am not a sulking old
man.''
   But with less than a month to go before the crucial elections,
Botha provoked another public confrontation, apparently
underestimating the support de Klerk enjoyed from the entire Cabinet.
   Botha said Friday he had not been properly informed of a planned
Aug. 28 trip to Zambia by de Klerk and Foreign Minister Pik Botha.
The meeting is an opening to black Africa that Botha had worked hard
to accomplish, and he had hoped to be the one making the trip.
   His decision to make public a dispute about a procedural point
not only embarrassed his party, but was seen as an unwarranted
attack on the veracity of the foreign minister. Pik Botha, no
relation to the president, had served him loyally for 11 years and
is credited with swinging his own supporters to P.W. Botha in the
tight battle for the prime ministership in 1978.
   Born Jan. 12, 1916, the son of a farmer in the rural Orange Free
State province, Botha never served in the military or graduated from
college. He quit university in 1935 to become a National Party
organizer.
   During World War II, Botha joined the Ossewabrandwag (Ox Wagon
Fire Guard), a group that was sympathetic to the Nazis and opposed
South Africa's participation on the Allied side.
   Botha won election to Parliament in 1948, the year the National
Party came to power and began codifying apartheid legislation. He
joined the Cabinet in 1961 and was named defense minister in 1966.
   He became head of the white-minority government Sept. 28, 1978,
and repeatedly stressed the paramount importance of national
security in the face of what he called a communist-led ''total
onslaught.''
   In 1984, Botha helped push through a new constitution that
brought Asians and people of mixed-race into the previously
all-white Parliament, but continued to exclude the 28-million black
majority.
   The constitution also changed Botha's title from prime minister
to president, with drastically increased powers. He used them to
declare a national emergency which, after three years, has stifled
the political violence that resulted from black anger over the new
constitution.
   Botha was credited with repealing some of apartheid's most
hurtful laws, but he made clear he would never consider the
possibility of black-majority government. He also promised that as
long as he was president, whites would retain segregated schools and
neighborhoods.
   Critics on the left said Botha's reforms were merely cosmetic,
while right-wing whites accused him of capitulating to blacks.

   A man arrested at the Capitol for killing
seven pigeons if they beat him to a peanut thrown by tourists could
have gotten a meal, the executive director of one downtown soup
kitchen said Monday.
   ``What I couldn't understand was if this was going on on a
continuing basis, why didn't the people stop feeding the pigeons,''
said Margaret Dockery, executive director of the Shepherd's Table
soup kitchen, about two blocks from where the man was arrested.
``There are plenty of places around here to eat.''
   People feeding peanuts to pigeons Sunday evening near Capitol
Square told police a man was killing any bird that reached a nut
before he did. Police said if a pigeon beat the man to the nuts, he
would wring its neck.
   Police said they had no idea if the incidents on Sunday were the
first time such a thing had occurred.
   Eladio Castillo, 65, was cited for violating a city ordinance
that makes it illegal to ``trap, hunt or otherwise kill ...
starlings or similar birds or fowl'' in an area declared a bird
sanctuary by the city, Lt. R.C. Friese said.
   Castillo is scheduled for a Sept. 18 court appearance. The
citation carries an unspecified fine and court costs as penalty.
   Although there were two soup kitchens within blocks of Capitol
Square, including the Shepherd's Table, neither was open at the time
Castillo was cited. The Shepherd's Table closes on weekends and The
Salvation Army's kitchen opened at noon Sunday, but closed 30
minutes later, according to a spokeswoman for the Raleigh mission.
   Ms. Dockery said she wasn't familiar with Castillo, although she
said she might recognize him if he had been to her kitchen. She said
if the man had been in Raleigh for any time, he should have known
about the Shepherd's Table.
   ``It's very well known,'' she said. ``We have been down here for
nine years. There's a camaraderie among the folks. Even if they
don't know the precise hours, we have a sign in the window.''
   Ms. Dockery said she has encountered people in her kitchen who
have needed more than attention to their nutrition.
   ``What is the major gap is in the mental health problem,'' she
said. ``A lot of times, one will make the other worse. They will
come in here sometimes and it's very obvious that they haven't been
eating because their minds are not organized enough to take care of
themselves.''
   Ann Burke, director of Urban Ministries, said she is aware that
the hungry will go through trash bins in search of food, but she had
never heard of anyone fighting animals for food.

   Iran's spiritual leader said Monday there
would be no dealings with the ``cursed'' United States, but the
foreign minister left open the possibility of negotiations on
American hostages held in Lebanon.
   ``American conditions for negotiations with Iran are
ridiculous,'' said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Most of the 16 Western
hostages in Lebanon, including eight Americans, are believed held by
pro-Iranian kidnappers.
   Tehran radio said Khamenei addressed these comments to U.S.
leaders: ``Next to the usurper regime ruling over occupied Palestine
(Israel), you are the most cursed government in the eyes of the
Iranian people. No one in the Islamic republic will hold talks with
you.''
   He was speaking to relatives of prisoners of war held by Iraq and
of soldiers missing in action in the 8-year war with Iraq, in which
a cease-fire was reached a year ago. The radio report was monitored
in Nicosia.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati arrived in Damascus, Syria,
Monday. When asked about the hostage situation, he said without
elaboration: ``No negotiations before the release of Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid.''
   Obeid is a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped by Israeli commandos
July 28 from his home in southern Lebanon. Israel has offered to
exchange him for three Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon and the
16 Western hostages.
   The differing viewpoints expressed by Khamenei and Velayati
reflects the divisions in the Iranian leadership on whether to help
arrange the release of the Western captives. Terry Andekson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, has been held
the longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Velayati said he was in Syria for talks on the situation in
Lebanon and had brought a letter to President Hafez Assad from
President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran.
   His remark on possible negotiations reflected a commentary Sunday
by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency outlining conditions
for release of the hostages.
   The agency said Iran would ``use its maximum influence for the
release of all the hostages'' if the United States freed $2 billion
in Iranian assets. The assets were frozen 10 years ago after
Iranians seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans
hostage for 444 days.
   It also linked freedom for the hostages to the release of Obeid,
who is affiliated with the Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah, or Party of
God, and to settlement of Lebanon's 14-year-old sectarian civil war.
   ``If the U.S. government really wants to solve the hostage issue
in Lebanon and has no plot in mind, it should first put Israel under
pressure to free Sheik Obeid at once,'' the commentary said.
   ``Secondly it should present a comprehensive plan for the release
of all the hostages, including the Iranian ones and the Lebanese
captives held by Israel.''
   Iran has long demanded the release of three Iranians missing in
Lebanon since 1982, who are believed to be dead.
   IRNA said Iran would ask ``the oppressed Lebanese Moslems to take
new steps toward solving the hostage crisis'' provided release of
the hostages would ``be a first step toward ... the return of
independence to Lebanon and restoration of the rights of its
Moslems.''
   President Bush said four days ago his administration wanted
better relations with Iran but would not engage in ``trading off or
negotiating for hostages.''
   Khamenei, usually considered a supporter of the those Iranian
leaders known as pragmatists, did not specifically mention the
Western hostages, but said of the Obeid kidnapping: ``In Lebanon,
America commits its greatest atrocities and encourages its puppet
Israel in kidnapping and hostage-taking.''
   Khamenei was chosen as Iran's religious leader to succeed
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian revolutionary patriarch who
died June 3.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the pragmatists, has indicated willingness
to negotiate with the United States. On Aug. 4, he said there were
``reasonable, prudent solutions'' to the ``problem of freeing the
hostages.''
   Radicals in Tehran, led by Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, have expressed opposition to any dealings with
Washington.
   Western intelligence officials say Mohtashemi was a founder of
Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella group for Shiite Moslem kidnap
gangs in Lebanon.

   The death of Rep. Larkin Smith in a plane crash
within 24 hours of official confirmation of Rep. Mickey Leland's
death brought to five the number of vacancies in the 435-member
House of Representatives.
   Three seats had been left vacant earlier this year by the
resignations of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and House
Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., and the death of Rep. Claude
Pepper, D-Fla.
   Smith, R-Miss., perished in the crash of a single-engine plane in
Mississippi Sunday night. Several hours earlier, rescue teams
confirmed the crash of a twin-engine plane on an Ethiopian
mountainside. Leland was among 16 people killed in the African crash.
   No arrangements had been set Monday for special elections to fill
the seat held by Leland, D-Texas, and Smith, a former Mississippi
county sheriff.
   Their deaths left the party lineup of the House at 255 Democrats
and 175 Republicans.
   In a special Texas election last Saturday to choose a successor
to Wright, Democrat Pete Geren and Republican Bob Lanier finished
one-two. The pair will now compete in a runoff election to be
scheduled probably in September for the Fort Worth district seat
that the Democrats held for 34 years before Wright resigned amid
allegations of ethical misconduct.
   In California, Democratcic state Assemblyman Gary Condit is
trying to succeed Coelho, who resigned in mid-June as questions were
raised about his financial dealings. Over the weekend, the San
Joaquin Valley Republican Party endorsed Clare Berryhill, a one-time
high-ranking California agriculture official who has entered the
campaign for the Sept. 12 primary.
   In Florida, Cuban-born state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen won the
Republican nomination earlier this month to succeed Pepper. In the
Democratic race, attorney Gerald Richman had 28 percent of the vote
Aug. 1 while former Miami City Commissioner Rosario Kennedy, also a
native of Cuba, had 27 percent and Jo Ann Pepper, niece of the late
Florida Democrat, garnered 24 percent. A runoff will pit Richman
against Kennedy on Tuesday with the winner facing Ros-Lehtinen on in
a general election Aug. 29.

   Africanized honeybees are still heading north
across Mexico but are not expected to arrive in the United States
until 1991 or later, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Popularly called ``killer bees'' by some, including movie
writers, the migrating bees were originally expected to reach the
southern United States in 1987 or 1988. Then, maybe 1989 or 1990.
   But department officials now say the bees won't reach the Rio
Grande Valley of southern Texas ``for another 18 months or later.''
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said a joint project with Mexico
has delayed the bees' arrival and ``should give researchers and
beekeepers enough time to study the bee and learn how to manage it.''
   The Africanized honeybee is the hybrid offspring of European
honeybees and pure African queen bees brought to Brazil in 1956 for
research. The African queens escaped and began interbreeding with
native honeybees.
   Africanized bees have been migrating northward since then and
were found in southern Mexico in 1986. Today, they are about 400
miles south of the U.S. border near Tecolutla in the Mexican state
of Veracruz.
   Although the venom of Africanized bees is no more potent than
that of the European bees that are common throughout the United
States, the hybrids can be more dangerous because of their
aggressiveness and the likelihood of them stinging in greater
numbers.
   Besides the notoriety as a fierce pest around humans and animals,
the Africanized honeybee also is feared by many commercial
beekeepers for what it might do to their industry.
   Glosser said his agency began working with the Mexican government
two years ago in a cooperative program to control the Africanized
bees.
   The program includes the detection and tracking of the bees as
they near the U.S. border; trapping and destruction of swarms to
reduce their numbers; and efforts to alter the bees genetically so
they pose less of a threat.
   ``Program personnel in Mexico have hung almost 60,000 traps in
the last 18 months and have caught more than 11,000 swarms of
Africanized bees,'' Glosser said. ``That's millions of Africanized
bees that will never reach the United States.''
   The project in Mexico also uses ``requeening'' to reduce the
transfer of Africanized traits to regular honeybee colonies.
   Beekeepers are encouraged to select queens from desirable genetic
stock and mark them with a bright paint so that it's easy to tell if
they are in the hive. If an unmarked queen is noted, that female is
replaced with a marked queen known to be of good genetic stock.

<HEAD>Device to Save Turtles Not Required by Shrimpers, Judge Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday permitted Gulf Coast
shrimp fishermen to temporarily avoid using devices attached to
their nets that protect endangered species of sea turtles.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan refused to disturb an
interim step instituted by the U.S. Commerce Department restricting
trawling times to 105-minute intervals.
   The National Wildlife Federation said the 105-minute requirement
fails to protect endangered sea turtles and has asked the judge to
require the shrimpers to equip their nets with the turtle excluder
devices, called TEDs.
   Hogan refused to rule on the merits of the 105-minute
requirement, saying he would await a final rule by the commerce
secretary.
   The interim restriction ``satisfies the court's order that some
conservation measures be put in place while permanent modification
of the existing TED regulations are being considered,'' Hogan said.
   ``It remains to be seen how the secretary will justify the sudden
shift away from TEDs and the adoption of a 105-minute tow time
restriction,'' said the judge.
   Hogan said the National Wildlife Federation raised ``substantial
concerns'' in a lawsuit regarding the adequacy of the 105-minute tow
time restriction, but called it ``premature'' to rule on their
objections.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has data from National Marine
Fisheries Service scientists showing the mortality rate from a
105-minute tow time is more than four times greater than what the
secretary has admitted, says the federation.
   Following an order issued by the judge, Mosbacher issued the
105-minute interim requirement. It became effective Aug. 8 and
expires Sept. 8.
   Mosbacher decided July 24 to suspend requirements for excluder
devices after Texas and Louisiana shrimp fishermen protested their
use by blockadng Gulf Coast shipping channels. The fishermen say the
turtle excluder devices reduce their catch by as much as a third.
   Hogan concluded that Mosbacher had failed to show good cause for
suspending the existing TED regulations for 45 days without adopting
an interim conservation measure.
   ``The secretary has utterly failed to show how the 45-day
suspension of any protection for endangered and threatened turtles,
during the height of the Gulf shrimping season, will foster
conservation,'' said Hogan's 17-page opinion.
   The wildlife federation, seeking to force the Commerce Department
to require the Gulf Coast shrimpers to use the TEDs, sued Mosbacher
the same day he suspended the regulations.
   The wildlife group is ``disappointed'' that the court is not
requiring the use of the excluder devices, said Robert Irvin, a
lawyer for the wildlife federation. ``We think that the 105-minute
tow time limit does not protect the turtles and that the government
has not presented any evidence to the contrary.''
   Irvin said he is ``pleased'' with the portion of Hogan's ruling
which ``makes it very clear that the secretary had no justification,
legal or factual, for the suspension'' of the regulation.
   The excluder devices are big boxes with hinged sides attached to
nets which allow turtles to swim through.
   Most shrimpers in South Carolina will continue to use the turtle
excluder devices, or TEDs, rather than pull their nets up every 105
minutes, said Wally Shaffer, executive director of the South
Carolina Shrimpers Association.
   Since South Carolina shrimpers can only drag their nets during
daylight, pulling the nets every 105 minutes for a half-hour would
substantially cut back the number of shrimp caught, Shaffer said.
   ``What it does mean is if a fisherman chose to go without TEDs,
he would have to have the nets out for two and a half or three hours
a day,'' he said. ``So most of them have chosen to use TEDs.''
   South Carolina mandated the use of the device before the TED
regulation went into effect for other states.

   Sixty-five soldiers parachuted into West
Texas early Monday, launching the first attack in the largest
air-defense artillery exercise ever conducted in the continental
United States.
   The mountains and desert of Texas and southern New Mexico are the
backdrop for the two-week, multiforce Exercise Roving Sands.
   Since the beginning of the month more than 8,000 soldiers, airmen
and Marines have been converging on Fort Bliss Army post along with
aircraft and artillery.
   The mock battles of the exercise will be carried out at Fort
Bliss, Biggs Army Airfield, White Sands Missile Range air space,
Holloman Air Force Base, N.M. and at Roswell, N.M.
   ``It's being done on this scale so that it can coordinate the
movements and activities for not only the Army but the Marines as
well and the capabilities of the Air Force,'' said Brad Rose, Fort
Bliss spokesman.
   Rose said similar scale practice maneuvers have been carried out
previously in Europe, but never in the United States.
   The 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, based at Fort Bliss, is
running the exercise.
   The operation has brought in Air Force units from Cannon,
Holloman and Kirtland Air Force Bases in New Mexico; Carswell AFB in
Fort Worth and Tinker AFB in Oklahoma. Also participating are
Marines from El Toro and Camp Pendleton and from Yuma, Ariz.
   ``The Marine Corps is playing the bad guys,'' said Sgt. First
Class James Swartz.
   The operation began at 6:30 a.m. Monday when the 65 soldiers
attacked the headquarters of the 11th Army brigade, Swartz said.
   Five AH-10 fighters have been flown in from Missouri and
Louisiana for the exercise. To transport equipment the troops will
use CH-54 ``Sky Crane'' helicopters from Birmingham, Ala.

   The number of workers employed by farmers
showed a seasonal increase in July but was down slightly from a year
ago, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   A quarterly report said the hired work force on farms was
estimated at 1,197,000 workers during the week of July 9-15, up from
830,000 in April. A year ago in July the work force was 1,200,000.
   Those did not include 351,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In April, those
totaled 198,000 workers, and in July 1988 they were estimated at
303,000.
   Rain in the Delta states and much of the Southeast during the
survey week limited fieldwork in many areas, the report said.
   The report said the national figures for hired workers had a
sampling error of 7 percent.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5.23
per hour, up from $4.90 per hour a year earlier but below the
average of $5.35 in April, the report said.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage rate
available. However, workers in California were reported at $5.80 per
hour, compared with $6.45 in April and $5.74 a year earlier in July
1988. Florida workers averaged $5.55 per hour, compared with $6.24
in April and $5.19 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Universities Bustle With Students Returning for Political Study</HEAD>

   Two Beijing universities were busy Monday with
students returning to campuses for mandatory political education
before going back to their regular studies.
   There were no obvious signs of the activism that marked last
spring's pro-democracy movement in which thousdands of students
boycotted classes and put up posters to press demands for reform.
   Instead, students on the campuses of Qinghua University and the
China People's University appeared to be occupied by by renewing old
friendships and rushing to classes.
   In April and May students demanded the ruling Communist Party
implement reforms, including press freedom. But in June authorities
responded with a military crackdown in which at least 200 people,
and perhaps several thousand, were killed. A wave of nationwide
arrests followed.
   Since then, officials have taken measures to gain control over
the unruly student population.
   At Beijing University first-year students will be required to
undergo a year of military training and ``cultural studies'' before
beginning academic work, officials announced. Previously students
had to take only two weeks of military training.
   And universities throughout China have reinstated political
education, which had been largely ignored in recent years.
   Most students went home for summer vacation in June, but
graduating seniors were required to sit through several weeks of
political education and write essays of ``self-criticism'' before
receiving their diplomas.
   On the campuses, which in the spring were rife with political
broadcasts and discussions, pro-democracy posters plastered on
dormitories have been scraped off. Bulletin boards now carry a few
advertisements and class announcements.
   On Monday, the few students who lingered outside their dorms were
subdued and cautious. ``Everything's just fine here,'' said one
young woman. ``No problems.''
   Upperclassmen at most universities in Beijing will return to
campus by early September. First-year students will begin their
studies about a month later.
   Beijing universities that led the student movement have had their
freshman enrollments cut by half or more. Nationwide, the number of
first-year students has been cut by 30,000 to 610,000.
   Officials have arrested at least seven of 21 Beijing University
students sought for involvement in the spring protests. At least two
have fled the country.

   Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak said Monday
he is ready to resign and abandon his bid to form a new government
so that the head of the smaller United Peasant Party can form a
coalition government.
   A Solidarity senator said the move appeared designed to block
Lech Walesa's attempt to form a government that excludes the
Communist Party.
   A Solidarity-led coalition has alarmed the Soviet Union and would
be the first non-communist government in the East bloc since the
late 1940s.
   Walesa has been trying for a week to persuade the Peasant Party,
led by Roman Malinowski and aligned with the Communists in
parliament, to join in a non-Communist coalition. Walesa has said he
cannot support any government formed by Kiszczak.
   ``A situation has emerged in which I see a chance for Roman
Malinowski to form a new government in which there would be
representatives of all forces in the parliament,'' Kiszczak said in
a statement carried by the PAP news agency.
   ``At the same time it would be a clear sign indicating the
priority given to agriculture and the food economy in Poland's
policy,'' Kiszczak said.
   Solidarity Sen. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Walesa's envoy to coalition
talks, said the independent trade union movement would not abandon
its efforts to form a government.
   Kaczynski said Kiszczak was trying to ``make it ... very
difficult, if not impossible'' for Solidarity to form the
government, but that he did not think that the proposal of
Malinowski for prime minister would succeed.
   Solidarity lawmaker Henryk Wujec, the first opposition lawmaker
to respond to the proposal of Malinowski to lead a government,
called it ``an idiotic move'' and in all likelihood unacceptable to
Walesa.
   Kiszczak was elected prime minister Aug. 2, winning a majority in
Parliament despite opposition from the Solidarity caucus, which
holds 35 percent the seats in the lower house.
   Walesa announced Aug. 7 he wanted to form a coalition government
and his representatives began talks Thursday with Malinowski's
United Peasant Party and the Democrats, the minor parties that hold
the balance of power.
   The United Peasant Party, which claims a membership of 500,000,
has been allied with the Communists since its creation in 1949 after
the forced merger of a pro-Communist Peasant Party and an opposition
Peasant Party. It has been allowed to develop a more independent
policy in the last decade, and about one-third of its 76 deputies
support Solidarity.
   The Communist Party responded with alarm when Walesa proposed
forming the government. On Friday, the Soviet Union joined in with
expressions of concern, warning against possible harm to the
stability of of Poland and Europe.
   By offering a non-Communist such as Malinowski to head the
government _ which in itself would be a first in postwar Poland _
the Communist Party apparently hopes avoid the once-unthinkable
prospect of a Solidarity government from coming true.
   Kiszczak said he had been trying to assemble a cabinet, but
Walesa's proposal ``complicates and prolongs the process.''
   He also said the Walesa proposal indicated the Solidarity
leader's negative attitude toward any form of coalition government
had eased, creating ``new chances'' for the ``grand coalition''
which he and the Communist Party have long advocated.
   For this reason, he said, he viewed Malinowski as having a chance
for forming such a coalition government.
   Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, speaker of the Sejm, said he did not know
what the effect of Kiszczak's statement would be, but it was ``a
proposal ... looking for another solution.''
   He said President Wojciech Jaruzelski must still accept
Kiszczak's resignation and the parliament would still have to vote
for Malinowski.
   However, Aleksander Bentkowski, the Peasant Party parliamentary
caucus leader, said he was not sure that Malinowski would accept the
nomination because of the slim chances of successfully forming a
coalition with Solidarity.
   Bentkowski said Solidarity has said repeatedly it wants to lead
the next coalition, so probably would not agree to support
Malinowski.
   ``Gen. Kiszczak in this way is presenting his resignation. ... In
an elegant manner he is making the president realize that somebody
else has to do it,'' Bentkowski said.
   ``In my opinion, the proposition of Lech Walesa (for a
Solidarity-led government) would be the best thing to do.''
   Solidarity's parliament leader, Bronislaw Geremek had no comment.
Walesa was unavailable for comment, his mother-in-law said.
   Malinowski, 54, trained as an economist, has been leader of the
Peasant Party since 1981 and in the previous term of the parliament
served as speaker of the Sejm. Malinowski was among the prominent
communist coalition candidates who failed to win election in June
parliamentary elections.
   Wujec said the Kiszczak announcement came as a surprise. Walesa
had traveled to Warsaw on Sunday in hopes of holding talks with
Malinowski and Democratic Party leader Jerzy Jozwiak, but returned
home Monday after neither agreed to a meeting.
   Solidarity Sen. Jaroslaw Kaczynski read a brief statement from
Walesa earlier in the day, in which he said the offer of a coalition
with the Peasants and Democrats stood.
   There was no further news on a possible meeting between Walesa
and Kiszczak, who on Saturday appealed for such a meeting. The
Solidarity leader said Sunday he hoped to meet Kiszczak ``in the
nearest future.''
   Kaczynski had confirmed Sunday that Walesa himself was
considering being prime minister in a Solidarity-led coalition.
   Under a political deal reached with the Communists before
partially free elections in June, the Communists have 37 percent of
the chamber and Solidarity 35 percent. Thus, the Peasant Party and
Democratic Party hold the balance of parliamentary power.
   Kaczynski began talks with the two minor parties Thursday and
they continued through the weekend at an undisclosed site, he said.
   Peasant Party deputies have said voters disliked the choice of
Kiszczak as prime minister, the election of Jaruzelski as president
and the selection of former Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski as
the new head of the communist party.
   The reshuffle left the impression among voters that nothing has
changed despite Solidarity's victory at the polls in June when union
backed candidates swept all 161 seats open to the opposition in the
460-member Sejm and 99 of 100 seats in the newly created Senate.

<HEAD>Missile Tests Conducted Near Remote Hawaiian Islands Despite Protests</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union, despite two high-level U.S.
appeals, last week conducted an intercontinental missile test near
two remote Hawaiian Islands, Bush administration officials said
Monday.
   The 8,000-mile-range, unarmed missile, launched from the Soviet
Union, flew between the two tiny islands, Necker and Nihoa, shortly
before splashing down Friday 1,250 miles southeast of Oahu.
   The Soviets had announced Aug. 7 their intention to conduct a
test sometime between Aug. 11 and Aug. 21. Neither of the two
private U.S. appeals to Deputy Ambassador Serge Chetverikov nor the
test itself was made public.
   ``It's somewhat disturbing the Soviets didn't take our concerns
into account,'' a U.S. official said Monday. ``There was no danger,
but there is always a risk, however slight, it might be that
something would go awry. That is why we felt it was inappropriate.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Raymond R. Seitz and his deputy,
Curtis W. Kamman, met last Monday and Tuesday with Chetverikov to
complain that the missile was likely to pass over the Hawaiian
Island chain before splashing down, two U.S. officials said.
   Seitz and Kamman are the senior officers in the State
Department's Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs.
   ``The U.S. government expressed its deep concern to the Soviets
over the planned test and asked that it be modified,'' the U.S.
official said.
   Chetverikov returned to the State Department on Wednesday to say
the test would be conducted strictly over international water.
   ``We did not find that response persuasive or sufficient, because
the Soviet missile test would pass over the Hawaiian Island chain,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It is not
a legal issue but an issue of political and safety considerations.
Once again, we strongly urged the Soviets to reconsider their
plans.''
   In the U.S. appeals to the Soviets, the planned test was
described as a ``provocation,'' said another U.S. official, who also
requested anonymity.
   U.S. relations with the Soviet Union have been on the upswing in
most areas of the world, although there have been recent
disagreements over U.S. assistance to rebels in Afghanistan and
Soviet overtures to Iran.
   Despite the U.S. appeals, the Soviets tested the missile, which
splashed down shortly after passing over the 600-kilometer channel
between Necker and Nihoa.
   As it turned out, the missile did not pass over either island.
The point of the U.S. complaint, one official said, was that ``it
was too close for comfort.''
   The Soviets' initial notice had said the targeted spashdown area
was a circle, with a radius of 30 nautical miles, about 1,200 miles
south of Oahu.
   Actually, one official said, the missile touched down about 1,250
miles south of Oahu.
   In their notice, the Soviets said another missile test might be
conducted within the Aug. 11-21 period as well, with a spashdown
target of a rectangle about 1,200 miles northwest of the Hawaiian
islands. Evidently that test was never conducted, but the reasons
why could not be learned.
   Two years ago, in a similar situation, the Soviets revised a
missile test near the Hawaiian chain when the Reagan administration
objected.

<HEAD>Panamanian Bank Laundered Drug Money, Fined $5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Panamanian bank pleaded guilty to
drug-laundering charges Monday and the United States, Canada and
Switzerland will share $5 million in seized drug trafficking profits
as a result, the Justice Department announced.
   ``This international cooperation in the war against drugs sends a
message to drug traffickers everywhere that it is going to be harder
for them to hide their ill-gotten profits, and easier for us to
recover them,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said.
   The department said Banco de Occidente of Panama pleaded guilty
in U.S. District Court in Atlanta to aiding Colombia's Medellin
Carter in laundering cocaine proceeds via wire transfers from the
United States to Panama and then to Europe.
   Chief Judge William C. O'Kelley ordered the bank to forfeit $5
million in substitute assets to make up for drug profits that had
been transferred to other accounts.
   The department said U.S. agencies will split $3 million of the
money and $1 million each will go to Canada and Switzerland.
   Under legislation enacted in 1986, the United States can seize
property owned or under the control of narcotics traffickers even
when the actual drug profits are no longer available for seizure.
   ``Moving the assets of illegal drug trafficing out of one bank
account and into another can no longer cover up the illegal act,''
Thornburgh said. ``It is like fingerprints that cannot be brushed
away.''
   The Panamanian bank and the Banco de Occidente of Cali, Colombia,
were charged as an outgrowth of the ``Operation Polar Cap''
investigation of the laundering of illegal drug profits.
   Charges against the Colombian bank were dismissed as a result of
the Panamanian bank's guilty plea to a two-count indictment. The
department said the Colombian bank guaranteed to the United States
the full payment of the Panamanian bank's forfeiture.
   The government said its evidence showed that the drug proceeds
were effectively removed from the United States and then passed
through Banco de Occidente.

   The Soviet Union has invited a
delegation of family and friends of Swedish diplomat Raoul
Wallenberg to Moscow to discuss his disappearance 44 years ago, an
official said Monday.
   Wallenberg, who would be 77, is credited with saving tens of
thousands of Hungarian Jews from Nazi concentration camps in World
War II.
   He was arrested by the Soviet army when it entered Budapest in
1945. Moscow has said he died of natural causes in prison in 1947,
but Soviet dissidents claimed to have seen him alive as late as 1986.
   The invitation to a four-member group indicated the Soviets might
release more information about Wallenberg's fate, said Sonja
Sonnenfeld, secretary of the Wallenberg Association.
   ``Just to repeat that old information would not be enough to
invite us,'' she said. ``The Soviets must be aware that there should
be new aspects.''
   It was the first time Soviet officials offered to meet
Wallenberg's family or association officials to discuss the case,
Ms. Sonnenfeld said.
   It was not immediately clear when the invitation was issued, but
Ms. Sonnenfeld said the group planned to travel to Moscow in
mid-October.
   Soviet officials invited Wallenberg's half-sister Nina Lagergren
and half-brother Guy von Dardel, Ms. Sonnenfeld and Per Anger,
Wallenberg's assistant at the Swedish Embassy in Budapest, she said.
   The group was promised meetings with high-level officials, Ms.
Sonnenfeeld said, ``but no names were mentioned and we didn't
insist.''
   Wallenberg issued Swedish travel documents to 20,000 Hungarian
Jews who were slated for Nazi concentration camps. His intervention
with German authorities was credited with the survival of another
100,000 Jews from the country's prewar community of 750,000.
   The Soviets never explained why Wallenberg was arrested. Some
historians believe he was mistaken for an American spy.

<TEXT>
   P.W. Botha resigned as
president Monday, after leading South Africa through 11 years of
racial and political upheaval and finally losing a bitter power
struggle within his National Party.
   Botha, whose power base began eroding after a stroke Jan. 18,
said Cabinet ministers forced him out and told him he could use his
health as an excuse.
   ``To this I replied, `I am not prepared to leave on a lie,'''
Botha, 73, said in a nationally televised speech.
   ``After all these years of my best efforts for the National
Party, and for the government of this country as well as the
security of our country, I am being ignored by ministers serving in
my Cabinet,'' Botha said.
   ``I have ... decided to submit my resignation to the chief
justice today with effect Aug. 15.''
   Botha showed no emotion as he read the 20-minute speech, seated
at his desk in his official residence in Cape Town. He showed no
signs of effects of the stroke.
   Botha previously had agreed, under pressure from party leaders,
to retire after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, but he
repeatedly provoked confrontations with the party and refused to
cooperate with younger leaders, forcing a showdown.
   F.W. de Klerk, 53, who succeeded Botha as National Party leader
in February, will be named Tuesday to serve as acting president
until the elections, the Foreign Ministry said.
   Botha began South Africa's first halting steps of race reform in
the late 1970s and early 1980s and liked to depict himself as the
first South African leader to pursue racial reform. But he always
defended the apartheid policies that deny the black majority a voice
in national affairs.
   His reform efforts slowed following nationwide black unrest in
1984, which erupted after Botha helped push through a constitution
that brought Asians and people of mixed-race into the previously
all-white Parliament but in separate chambers.The constitution
continued to exclude the black majority.
   The new constitution also gave Botha almost unlimited governing
power, which he used to declare a national emergency that has
stifled the political violence.
   The banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition, said the leadership change would make
little difference to South Africa's 28 million blacks.
   ``De Klerk was party to the disasterous policies of the
government under P.W. Botha's rule,'' the front said in a statement.
``The mass democratic movement demands the government as a whole
resigns so that democracy and peace may be established once and for
all.''
   De Klerk, a lawyer who appeared to agree with Botha on most major
policy issues, has spoken in vague terms of speeding up the pace of
race reform.
   However, he has not promised specific changes on major apartheid
issues such as power-sharing with the black majority or
desegregating schools and neighborhoods.
   Many whites have seen de Klerk as representing a new, more
conciliatory generation of National Party leaders. They welcomed the
vision of a nation in which, as he put it, ``all reasonable people
align themselves behind mutually acceptable goals.''
   Helen Suzman, an anti-apartheid pioneer in Parliament, said of
him: ``People are being too optimistic if they think he is going to
throw fundamental policy overboard, but I think he's pragmatic and
intelligent. He realizes that change is absolutely inevitable.''
   De Klerk said Botha's decision to retire ``was in the best
interest of South Africa.''
   ``We are sad that a man who has done so much for his country has
to retire under these unhappy circumstances,'' de Klerk said in a
televised interview after Botha's speech.
   The battle between Botha and the National Party turned into a
public showdown when Botha charged Friday he had not been consulted
about de Klerk's planned Aug. 28 meeting with Zambian President
Kenneth Kaunda.
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha, who is not related to the outgoing
president, had issued a statement Thursday evening saying Botha was
informed of the trip.
   The diplomatic mission could bolster South Africa's long-strained
relations with black Africa. As president, Botha had worked hard to
increase South African contact with the rest of the continent.
   However, Botha said it was ``inopportune to meet with President
Kaunda at this stage,'' because the African National Congress
guerrilla movement is based in Zambia. The ANC is the largest
guerrilla group fighting the South African government.
   ``President Kaunda's action is aimed at promoting the ANC's
image,'' Botha said.
   Botha's statements are likely to damage the National Party in the
September elections, particularly among conservative whites who
generally see the ANC as a terrorist organization.
   Botha, in one of his rare public comments in recent months,
insisted he was not a ``sulky old man.''
   But he never congratulated de Klerk, who had been the education
minister, on becoming National Party leader. Last month Botha
refused to attend a farewell banquet planned for him by the National
Party, which he served 54 years.

seriously burned two people in the car, the army said.
   Two men in the front seat suffered burns over 40 percent to 60
percent of their bodies, said Ruth Meckel, spokesman for Hadassah
Hospital in Jerusalem. A man and a woman in the back seat were
slightly injured.
   Israel radio said the radical Moslem group Islamic Jihad group
claimed responsibility for the attack, in a statement issued in
Amman, Jordan. The group has no known relation to kidnappers in
Lebanon who use the same name.
   Soldiers clamped a curfew on the area of Ramallah where the
attack occurred, and Israel radio said about 40 Palestinians were
detained.
   Soldiers also welded shut the doors of about 10 neighborhood
shops, a common punishment.
   There have been repeated confrontations between Israeli
authorities and Palestinians over non-payment of taxes. Underground
leaders of the anti-Israeli uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip have urged Palestians to withhold taxes to undercut
Israel's economy.
   In the past, the government has seized Palestinians' identity
papers to force payment of taxes.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, masked youths set ablaze a bus
carrying Arab workers to jobs in Israel. Arab reporters said no one
was injured because the youths ordered the driver and passengers off
the bus before setting it afire.
   Preventing Palestinians from working in Israel also is a tactic
of the uprising leaders.
   The Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal, claimed
responsibility for the bus burning in slogans painted on walls in
black and green paint.
   At least 536 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with
soldiers or Israeli civilians since the uprising began in December
1987. Thirty-eight Israelis have been slain.
   Right-wing and Jewish settler leaders said Monday a leading
rabbi's declaration that Jewish law could permit trading occupied
land for peace is dangerous and may lead to ``the bloodshed of our
homeland.''
   The statement by Rabbi Ovadia Yosef on Sunday night drew the
strongest ire from the Gush Emunim settler movement, which believes
Jews must retain the West Bank and Gaza Strip for religious reasons.
   Israel seized the land from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East War.
   ``It's a shame that a great man of Israel did damage to the
nation of Israel, especially now when we need to be united,'' said
Gush Emunim spokesman Noam Arnon.
   Yosef, spiritual mentor of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, is
considered one of the greatest experts on Halacha, or Jewish law.
   Right-wing legislator Geula Cohen, whose Tehiya Party advocates
annexing the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said Yosef was opening the
way for Israel's enemies to gain territory.
   ``He is calling on our enemies to threaten us with war,'' she
said. ``He is responsible for this, the bloodshed of our homeland,
not only our people.''
   Yosef told 1,000 Orthodox Jews that the government could return
occupied land if it saved Jewish lives and avoided war.
   Israeli newspapers Sunday reported that Yosef, a former chief
rabbi, has received death threats from extremists since his
statement.
   In Tunisia on Monday, U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr.
met for three hours with a Palestine Liberation Organization
delegation in the fourth formal session since the U.S.-PLO dialogue
opened last year.
   The dialogue began after the PLO renounced violence and
recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Pelletreau said the meeting in a suburb of Tunis was held at the
request of the United States. No details were released.
   The Palestinian delegation was led by Yasser Abd-Rabboo, a member
of the PLO executive committee, who said the discussions would
continue ``in the near future.''

<HEAD>Research Indicates Nicotine Impairs Brain Cells</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New research indicates that nicotine
impairs rather than stimulates brain cells, contrary to earlier
belief, and may explain the drug's calming effect, a pharmacologist
reported Monday.
   Linda Wong of the University of Texas-Galveston said that
nicotine, a substance found in tobacco, suppresses rat brain cells
that control basic behaviors such as learning, memory and emotion.
   Wong's conclusions, presented at the 40th annual meeting of the
American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics,
contradict the traditional scientific belief that nicotine
stimulates brain cells.
   Scientists have believed for years that the drug excites some
neurons, which in turn inhibit other brain functions to induce a
calming effect on smokers. Neurons are nerve cells.
   Wong said her studies on rats suggest that nicotine directly
reduces neuron activity in people.
   ``Being as it is an inhibiting response, it may be implicated in
anxiety relief,'' she said in an interview.
   Wong, who is to receive her doctorate in September, said her
findings were based on a two-year study in which nicotine was
applied to tissue removed from the brains of rats.
   She said the tissue was from a small area at the base of the
brain that integrates learning, memory and emotions. The nicotine
either was applied directly or included in a simulated spinal fluid
absorbed by the tissue.
   Wong said she and her supervisor, pharmacology professor Joel P.
Gallagher, originally sought to learn the mechanisms controlling a
neuron receptor linked to theta rhythm, an electrical current
produced by the brain.
   It was by chance they noticed that nicotine restrained neural
activity.
   ``It was startling and surprising, and we pursued it with all
gusto,'' she said. ``That really triggered our interest.''
   They found that nicotine makes it more difficult for neurons to
fire signals to other neurons because the drug causes the affected
neuron to release potassium, which plays a critical role in the
transmission of nervous impulses.
   Wong declined to say that she was certain the same effect would
be duplicated in people who consume nicotine, but said that appeared
to be the case.
   ``The rat is so well used as a model system, it may well provide
a good model'' for human cell response, she said.
   Such studies may also provide information about diseases linked
to neuron firing, such as Alzheimer's, Wong said. She said nicotine
affects a neural receptor that appears to be a factor associated
with the degenerative disease.
   Alzheimer's patients generally have fewer of the ``nicotinic''
receptors than those without the disease. Wong said that by better
understanding how the nicotinic receptors behave, scientists may
learn how Alzheimer's impairs such functions as memory.
   Wong said a paper describing her research was being considered
for publication by a national scientific publiction she declined to
identify.
   Wong has accepted a research position at Children's Hospital in
Boston, where she will focus on nicotine's effect on the size of
electrical signals between brain cell molecules.

<HEAD>Peruvian Miners Begin Indefinite Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mine workers began on Monday an indefinite
strike for higher wages and nationwide collective bargaining,
cutting this impoverished nation from its principal source of income.
   Reports from the central Andes mining regions indicated most of
the country's 80,000 miners joined in the strike and many pits were
closed.
   The Communist-led National Federation ofMine Workers called the
strike with nationwide collective bargaining a major issue.
Currently, each company neogotiates with its own workers and there
is a wide variation in wage scale.
   Jorge Quesada, the union's secretary-general, said 75,000 miners
were participating in the strike.
   He said that 27 miners, including nine union leaders, were
detained Monday by army troops at mines near La Oroya, 100 miles
east of Lima.
   Since last year the La Oroya area has been under a state of
emergency as part of the measures to fight Peru's leftist guerrillas.
   On Sunday the army imposed a 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew in the
mining region in anticipation of strike-related violence.
   Miners went on strike twice last year and stayed away from their
jobs for a total of three months over the issue of collective
bargaining.
   The mine-owners association has said the strikes cost Peru $497
million in lost production and exports. Mining exports, which were
$1.2 billion last year, account for more than half the country's
sales abroad.
   The union also is seeking a minimum wage of about $500 monthly
for all miners, regardless of employer. Large mines pay between $5
and $12 a day while small and medium-sized mines pay between $2 and
$6 a day, according to union figures.
   A spokesman for the U.S.-owned Southern Peru Copper Corp., Peru's
second- largest mining operation, said early reports from its
foundry in Ilo, 550 miles southeast of Lima, indicted 80 percent of
workers had walked off the job.
   Authorities in Huancayo, 150 miles east of Lima and in Peru's
central minining region, said most workers were respecting the
strike call.
   To end last year's strikes, the government in December signed an
accord with union leaders giving tentative approval to collective
negotiations. But mine owners rejected the agreement, which they
said illegally modified existing contracts.

   An armed assailant beat and handcuffed a
man Monday and abducted his wife and two young children, who were
found later huddled next to their mother's body in a wooded area,
police said.
   A 21-year-old man was arrested on charges of murder and
kidnapping at about 5:45 p.m. after he turned himself in for
questioning at a police station about 110 miles north of Augusta,
state police spokesman Randy Nichols said.
   Byron Raines of Gardiner, who was employed by an electrical
contractor in the Augusta area, was being held in the Kennebec
County Jail while awaiting arraignment on Tuesday or Wednesday,
Nichols said.
   Authorities said family members identified the dead woman as Peg
Shaw, 35, who had been reported abducted early in the morning.
   By early afternoon, police had put out an all-points bulletin for
Raynes. Nichols refused to say whether there was any evidence
putting him at the scene in the Shaw home in this Augusta suburb.
   Nichols identified the father who was struck on the head as John
Shaw, and the children as his son, Sam, 3, and daughter, Julia, 1.
The children were reunited with their father, police said.
   ``They're somewhat in a state of shock, as can be expected,''
Nichols said. ``They have no apparent physical injuries.''
   About 6:30 a.m., an assailant entered the Shaw home, striking
Shaw in the head with a wooden mallet and then handcuffing him in
the basement, Nichols said.
   About an hour later, neighbors heard Shaw screaming for help.
Police were notified, and while they were questioning Shaw, the
family's silver Toyota van drove by the house, Nichols said.
   ``Mr. Shaw points it out. The police took chase,'' Nichols said.
``We feel at that point that the suspect was alone.'' He did not
elaborate on what the suspect might have done with the family at
that point.
   The van was soon discovered abandoned at some railroad tracks
near downtown Gardiner and the Kennebec River, Nichols said.
   Early in the afternoon, a state police trooper noticed some
tracks coming from a muddy road in South Gardiner. Nearby, the
trooper found the woman's body and the two children huddled together.
   The man was believed to be armed with a handgun.
   ``Mr. Shaw is OK,'' Nichols said. ``He's at a neighbor's house
being taken care of.''
   ``We have no information on a motive at this time,'' Nichols
said. ``It's being handled as an abduction, a kidnapping, and an
assault, obviously, and what has prompted it, we're unable to
determine at this time.''
   Police at the scene were using an airplane to search the area,
and several boats were being used on the Kennebec, Nichols said.
   By late morning, authorities had also set up roadblocks on U.S.
201 between Augusta and Gardiner and on U.S. 201 at the
Kennebec-Sagadahoc county line, Deputy Police Chief Craig Marshall
said.

<HEAD>More Rain Soaks East Coast; Some Local Flooding Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Much of the nation's Eastern quarter was soaked again Monday as
showers and thunderstorms fell from eastern Georgia to southern New
England. Scattered showers fell over sections of the Plains and the
West.
   Some of the storms were rather slow-moving and contained heavy
rain, causing flooding in some areas. Heavy rains over the past
several days have saturated the ground and compounded the problem of
street flooding and flooding of low-lying areas along the Atlantic
Coast.
   Lightning strikes caused power outages in Mattituck, N.Y. Gusts
of up to 40 mph were reported during a thunderstorm in Houlton,
Maine.
   Showers and thunderstorms also fell on the Florida Panhandle, and
the heavy rain was expected to spread to northern Florida, southern
Georgia and the Carolinas.
   Showers and thunderstorms lingered from eastern half of Oklahoma
to central and eastern Texas, and showers and scattered
thunderstorms fell across Utah, northwestern Colorado, eastern Idaho
and western Wyoming.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included more than an inch in Brunswick, Ga., and Marquette, Mich.
   Low-temperature records for the date were tied in Meridian,
Miss., where the thermometer dipped to 62 degrees, and in Pueblo,
Colo., where it was 52.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Ely, Minn., to 106 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif. The
morning low for the Lower 48 states was 33 degrees in Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the mid-Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley and
the eastern Great Lakes region; along much of the East Coast; in
central and eastern Texas; and in the central and northern Rockies
and parts of Utah and Arizona.
   Highs in the 70s were forecast from the northern Plains and
Nebraska to the Great Lakes, in northern Maine and in the Pacific
Northwest; in the upper 9os to 105 degrees in the interior valleys
of California; up to 110 degrees in the desert Southwest; and in the
80s and 90s in most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Says Iran Made Two Attempts to Buy Hazardous Fungi in Netherlands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND de LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAARN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's attempt to buy poison-producing
fungi in the Netherlands in February was its second try in a year, a
spokesman for a Dutch research agency said Monday.
   An Iranian organization approached the Central Bureau for Fungus
Cultures last year about several types of fungus that can be used to
produce mycotoxin, a substance commonly called ``yellow rain,'' said
spokesman Huub van der Aa. Mycotoxins can be fatal in sufficient
quantities.
   The Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology in
Tehran made similar request in February, Van der Aa said. On Sunday,
the New York Times reported that Iran also tried to acquire the
fungi in Canada.
   ``We refused to provide the fungi last year because the Iranians
were unable to clarify what they needed the stuff for,'' Van der Aa
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from this Dutch
town 18 miles east of Amsterdam. He said he did not remember exactly
when the first request arrived.
   His agency, a branch of the Netherlands' Royal Academy of
Sciences, was advised by the Foreign Ministry this year of an
anticipated request and its possible purpose, Van der Aa said. The
academy is an independent institution partly financed with
government funds.
   A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Monday: ``We heard reports ... in an informal
circuit of like-minded nations'' that regularly discuss the global
flow of fungi and bacteria for commercial and scientific purposes.
   She said the informal group was made up ``several nations within
the OECD area.'' The Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development has 24 members, including all NATO nations, Japan and
neutral countries such as Austria, Finland, and Switzerland.

<HEAD>Church Membership Gains Slower Than Population</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church affiliation in the United States is still
growing slowly, but not as fast as the population, the latest
statistics showed Monday.
   Members of Christian religious congregations increased by less
than 1 percent from 142.7 million to 143.8 million in 1987, the
latest year for which figures have been gathered.
   But that increase lagged slightly behind population growth; as a
result, the percentage of Americans affiliated with a Christian
denomination inched downward a bit from 58.7 percent of the
population to 58.6 percent.
   The new figures were issued in the 1989 Yearbook of American and
Canadian Churches, compiled by the the research section of the
National Council of Churches.
   The Roman Catholic Church and several conservative denominations,
such as the big Southern Baptist Convention, increased in
membership, while many mainline Protestant bodies showed membership
losses.
   The mainline losses continued a longtime trend that began in the
mid-1960's.
   The losses this time were small, however, mostly just over a
percentage point, while the gains among others also were small,
generally about 2 percent.
   Overall Canadian church membership also grew slightly, from 15.5
million to 15.8 million.
   The yearbook also shows a steep rise in the proportion of women
clergy, with 7.9 percent of ministers now women in denominations
which ordain women.
   That's up from 4 percent, or nearly double, from 10 years earlier.
   The total count of ordained women _ 20,730 _ also is nearly
double the 10,470 a decade ago.
   Among nine denominations regularly reporting contributions, the
yearbook showed per captia giving increased 6.2 percent to an
average $342.67 annually per person from an average $320.70 the year
before.
   That rise outpaced the inflation rate of 4.4 percent.
   Denominations reporting membership dips, and a percentage loss,
included:
   Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), down 1.8 percent;
Episcopal Church, down 1.7; Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), down 1.3;
United Church of Christ, down 0.8 and United Methodist Church, down
0.7.
   Denominations reporting membership gains, and percentage gain,
included:
   Christian and Missionary Alliance, up 2.3 percent; The Church of
God of Anderson, Ind., up 2.4; the Free Methodist Church, up. 2.2;
International Church of Foursquare Gospel, up. 2.8; Jehovah's
Witnesses, up 2.8.
   Also Assemblies of God, up 1.2; the General Association of
General Baptists, up 1.7; Mennonite Church, up 1.9; Presbyterian
Church in America, up 1.5; Roman Catholic Church, up 1.1; Seventh
Day Adventist Church, up 1.4; and Southern Baptist Convention, up
0.7.

   Reps. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and Larkin Smith,
R-Miss., were the 16th and 17th members of Congress to be killed in
air crashes since 1928, according to the House historian.
   The remains of Leland's twin-engine plane were found Sunday in a
remote area of Ethiopia where it crashed while transporting the
congressman and 15 others to a refugee camp.
   Smith's private plane went down in a forest area in Mississippi
Sunday night, killing both the first-term congressman and his pilot.
   ``This is unprecedented outside of wartime in my experience to
lose two such promising members by accidental death in the same
week,'' Speaker Tom Foley said Monday.
   Another notable year was 1972 when three members of the House
were killed in crashes, two on the same aircraft.
   The plane carrying Reps. Hale Boggs, D-La. and Nick Begich,
D-Alaska, disappeared during a campaign trip in Alaska. The plane
was never found.
   Boggs' wife, Corrine C. ``Lindy'' Boggs ran for his seat and is
in her ninth term representing the New Orleans area.
   The same year, Rep. George Collins, D-Ill., died when the plane
he was riding crashed during a landing at Midway Airport in Chicago,
killing 44 other people as well.
   His wife, Cardiss Collins, was elected to fill his seat and is in
her ninth term in the House.
   Another congressional wife to win her husband's seat after a
plane crash was Katharine Edgar Byron. She was married to Rep.
William Byron, D-Md., who was killed in 1941 when his plane went
down at Jonesboro, Ga., near Atlanta.
   Her daughter-in-law, Rep. Beverly Byron, D-Md., now is in her
sixth term representing the same district, which she won after her
husband Rep. Goodloe Edgar Byron, elected to the seat in 1971, died
from a heart attack.
   Until this weekend, the most recent plane death among congressmen
was Rep. Larry McDonald, D-Ga., who was on KAL Flight 007 when it
was shot down by oviet fighter planes over the Sea of Japan in 1983.
   Two senators have been killed in plane crashes. Sen. Bronson
Cutting, R-N.M., died in 1935 in a crash near Atlanta, Mo., and Sen.
Ernest Lundeen, of the Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota, was killed
in a plane that went down in 1940 near Lovettsville, Va.
   Other victims of aircraft accidents, according to historian
Raymond Smock and congressional staff:
   _Rep. Thaddeus Sweet, R-N.Y., 1928, in Whitney Point, Broome
County, N.Y.
   _Rep. William Kaynor, R-Mass., 1929, near Washington, D.C.
   _Rep. John Ditter, R-Pa., 1943, near Columbia, Pa.
   _Rep. Robert Coffey, D-Pa., 1949, in Albuquerque, N.M.

<TEXT>
   Four armed kidnappers who freed three
hostages and escaped to Paraguay in a plane provided by authorities
flew back to Brazil Monday after a gunbattle with Paraguayan police,
officials reported Monday.
   They said the plane carrying the kidnappers, identified as two
married couples, landed on a farm in Toledo in southern Brazil and
the four stole a truck and drove south toward the Paraguayan border,
about 50 miles away.
   The fugitives, who last week obtained a $42,000 ransom in
exchange for a 9-year-old boy they had kidnapped, briefly took a
farmworker hostage after landing in Toledo but released him before
fleeing, local police spokesman Eduardo Silva said.
   He said police had spotted and surrounded the truck near the
Paraguayan border.
   Earlier, Brazilian police said they thought the plane had flown
north to Bolivia after the shootout with Paraguayan police..
   In Brasilia, the capital, federal police spokesman Paulo Marra
said the pilot and co-pilot of the twin-engine Cessna aircraft were
released when the plane landed in Toldeo and were questioned by
officials there.
   The two had volunteered to fly the fugitives from the town of
Presidente Prudente in southern Brazil to a destination of the
group's choice. They flew south to Paraguay, where the band's leader
reportedly owns a farm.
   But the plane was refused permission to land at a clandestine
airstrip near Hernandarias about 20 miles over the border. The four,
armed with hand grenades, submachine guns, pistols and shotguns,
exchanged gunfire with Paraguayan authorities, Marra said.
   ``The Paraguayan government did not authorize the plane to land
in its territory,'' Marra said. ``There was an exchange of gunfire,
and the co-pilot was shot in the right forearm.''
   In an interview with Globo television, the pilot, Aniceto de
Oliveira Gomes said, ``When we landed in Paraguay we were met by
gunfire. I thought I was seeing a film about Vietnam.''
   The Paraguayan Embassy in Brasilia confirmed the plane had landed
near Hernandarias and that it was surrounded by police but denied
there was a shootout.
   The drama that took police on a ten-day car chase through three
Brazilian states began Aug. 3 when 9-year-old Said Agel Filho was
abducted in front of his home in central Goiania, 135 miles
southwest of Brasilia, the capital.
   Six days later, police traced a phone call from the kidnappers to
the boy's family and surrounded a house on the city's outskirts. The
kidnappers negotiated the ransom and an armored car to escape.
   Three adults, including two television news reporters, then
offered to exchange places with the boy, and the kidnappers accepted.
   The group later released one of the reporters and headed for the
Goiania airport with the driver as the third hostage.
   But authorities there refused to give them a plane and pilot and
the kidnappers then set off on a 500-mile trip through the states of
Goias, Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo.
   The hostages were released unharmed Sunday after authorities in
Presidente Prudente provided the kidnappers with a plane and the
pilot, Oliveira Gomes, a rancher and a local mayor. The co-pilot was
identified as Antonio Seregatti.
   Brazilian police lost track of the plane soon ater it took off
late Sunday afternoon because it was flying at an extremely low
altitude.

was charged with making a terrorist threat on the TV anchorwoman.
   The district attorney's office said that for five years Hudson,
57, had been writing letters, making phone calls and sending gifts
to Miss Lange, which were returned.
   An executive at KNBC contacted the district attorney's office
last Thursday and said he had been notified of the threat, which
allegedly was made last Wednesday, authorities said.
   Police launched an investigation, interviewed the co-worker and
found out that Hudson had been fired Thursday from his job as a
laborer at a gold bullion exchange.
   Hudson was arrested Friday at a motel where he lived. Police said
they recovered a .38-caliber Colt revolver and ammunition when they
arrested him.
   Hudson was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday, and the district
attorney's office said they would ask for $50,000 bail.
   Ms. Lange and KNBC-TV had no comment on the arrest, said station
spokesperson Regina Miyamoto. ``This is in the hands of the police,
the district attorney and the courts,'' Ms. Miyamoto said.
   A recent spate of threats and acts of violence against
celebrities have produced concern and even legislation on the issue
of celebrity safety.
   Robert John Bardo, 19, described as an ``obsessed fan'' of
actress Rebecca Schaeffer, is charged with shooting her to death at
the door to her Los Angeles apartment on July 18.
   In response to Schaeffer's slaying, state assemblyman Mike Roos
announced Aug. 1 he planned to introduce legislation to restrict
public access to address information held by the Department of Motor
Vehicles.
   In June, a state parole board delayed for at least nine months
the release on parole of Arthur Jackson, convicted of a nearly fatal
knife attack on actress Theresa Saldana in 1982. From prison,
Jackson wrote letters threatening Ms. Saldana.
   Jackson's eligibility for parole after serving seven years of a
12-year prison sentence has been assailed by Ms. Saldana. It
inspired a new state law to keep violent, mentally ill prisoners in
mental hospitals after they complete their sentences.
   Last December, two guards were shot and killed at Universal
Studios last December by a man who demanded to see actor Michael
Landon, star of ``Highway to Heaven.''

<TEXT>
   Finnish conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen said
Monday he has agreed to succeed Andre Previn as music director of
the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
   The 31-year-old Salonen's appointment was formally announced at a
Music Center news conference.
   ``This is one of the happiest days of my life with the
Philharmonic,'' said Michael J. Connell, president of the
Philharmonic Association's Board of Directors.
   Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann said the appointment is
``sending a signal to the world that we mean business'' about the
orchestra's future.
   Salonen will be the 11th conductor in the orchestra's 70-year
history. He accepted the position, he said, because ``it's a great
orchestra and the artistic potential involved is enormous.''
   He said he felt he already had developed good rapport with its
musicians.
   Salonen has served as principal conductor of the Swedish Radio
Symphony and principal guest conductor of the London Philharmonia
since 1985. He also is principal guest conductor of the Oslo
Philharmonic.
   He will retain his post with the Swedish Radio Symphony when he
assumes his new position in Los Angeles. Under the contract, Salonen
will assume the directorship at the beginning of the 1992-93 season
and will continue through the 1994-95 season.
   Salonen won international attention in 1983 when, with less than
a week's notice, he conducted the London Philharmonic in a
performance of Gustav Mahler's Third Symphony.
   He made his U.S. debut the following year with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic and went on to lead the orchestras of West Berlin, New
York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Paris, Montreal, Minneapolis
and Washington.
   Also a composer, Salonen is known as a champion of contemporary
work and a supporter of avant-garde experimentation.
   ``My experience is you have to combine things, showing that
contemporary music is the result of the traditional, the older
music,'' Salonen said. ``If you make the right, interesting
combination, it works.''

<HEAD>Giant European Atom Smasher Produces Z Particles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at Europe's new particle accelerator,
the world's biggest, said Monday they have produced the first
specimens of a kind of particle from which they expect to gain clues
to the basic forces of nature.
   The successful start of the atom smasher, the Large
Electron-Positron Collider, paves the way for ensuring `'Europe's
position at the forefront of particle physics research throughout
the next decade,'' the European Laboratory for Particle Physics said
in a statement.
   Scientists shooting beams of particles _ electrons and positrons
_ around the 17-mile circular tunnel under the Swiss-French border
reporded the LEP produced its first so-called Z particle Sunday,
said the lab, known by its former French acronym CERN.
   A month after its first test run, LEP's giant detectors, more
than 5,000 magnets and other parts have proven to be ``working and
ready to produce results,'' CERN said.
   By the fall, LEP is expected to produce thousands of Zs daily,
creating a greater scope for detailed study than its innovative but
less prolific U.S. competitor, the Stanford Linear Accelerator at
Menlo Park, Calif., according to the statement.
   LEP, built over eight years with 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($790
million) from CERN's 14 members states, is the most powerful
particle accelerator and the largest scientific instrument ever
made, according to CERN.
   It said the machine will recreate with new sophistication the
dense swirl of matter just after the Big Bang, the explosion
scientists believe created the universe 15 billion years ago.
   Z particles existed naturally only for an instant after the Big
Bang. By watching them decay into other particles, CERN scientists
hope to get new insight into the structure of matter and the
development of the universe.
   In particular, results of the Z experiments are expected to help
complete a scientific model explaining the interaction of nature's
postulated four basic forces _ gravity, electromagnetism and the
weak and strong forces.
   Carlo Rubbia, the Italian physics professor who heads CERN,
shared the 1984 Physics Nobel Prize with Dutch scientist Simon van
der Meer for discovering the Z at CERN. But stronger colliders were
needed to make enough so scientists can draw well-founded
conclusions from the random ways the particle breaks down.
   One of the most fascinating results may be the discovery of an as
yet theoretical particle believed to be the key to mass _ why things
weight what they do.

<TEXT>
   The question rang out Monday at a Capitol
memorial service for Rep. Mickey Leland and three congressional
staffers who died with him: ``We ask God, `Why These?' They're our
best.''
   Across Capitol Hill, staff members from other representatives'
offices were pitching in, answering phones and doing other chores as
condolences poured into Leland's House office.
   Elsewhere, hunger organizations were coming forward with ideas
for memorializing the Texas Democrat's work.
   While workers were struggling to recover the bodies of Leland and
15 others who died when their plane crashed in a rugged area of
Ethiopia, the shock of Sunday's announcement that they had indeed
been killed was giving way back home to a resigned sadness and
promises to follow his lead.
   Leland, 44, chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, was
on his sixth visit to Africa and his second this year when his plane
crashed Aug. 7 en route to Fugnido refugee camp. The wreckage was
discovered Sunday.
   It was his second trip to the region since March to focus
attention on the need for hunger relief for hundreds of thousands of
Sudanese, who have been forced from their homes by the country's
long-running civil war.
   At the Capitol service, in the stately caucus room of the Russell
Senate Office Building, Senate aide Robert Mallett said, ``This
mission was a mission of mercy. It was the best our country had to
offer. It showed our compassion, our generosity, our interest in
seeing that there are no more hungry people, the children would not
die of hunger.''
   ``We ask God, `Why These?' said Mallett, an aide to Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas. ``I suppose the answer lies somewhere in thinking
about the condition of the world. They went about doing good. To
heal the world.''
   Mallett said, ``We're going to see that there are no more hungry
children in Ethiopia, anywhere in the world. In that way, we will
know that in your dying, you have challenged us to live.''
   On the crimson-carpeted platform behind him, four white candles
flickered in silver candlesticks. Velvet drapes covered the arched
windows, as mourners wiped away tears or hid their crying eyes in
their hands.
   ``We gather today with heavy hearts as we join with his staff,
his family, and Senate staff in this great, immeasurable loss,''
prayed Senate Chaplain Richard C. Halverson. ``We remember the
hungry and the homeless for whom he laid down his life.''
   The memorial service, sponsored by the Senate Black Legislative
Staff Caucus, honored congressional members of the entourage in
addition to Leland: Patrice Y. Johnson, Leland's chief of staff;
Joyce Williams, a staff member with Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., and
Hugh A. Johnson Jr., a staff member of the Hunger Committee.
   Elsewhere at the Capitol, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said,
``There will be a determination on the part of members of the House
to work for those goals that Mickey Leland sought to achieve, the
alleviation of hunger and suffering here and in Africa and elsewhere
in the world.''
   Foley said Leland's willingness to return to Africa time after
time, despite unstable political conditions and the risks of travel,
was a ``testament to his determination individually to follow
through on commitments and values that were very, very close to him.
   ``And I think other members will also be willing to assume those
risks and I don't think this will change,'' said Foley.
   Letters, telegrams and phone calls of condolence continued to
pour into Leland's office Monday, as staff members from other
congressional offices pitched in to help.
   Staff members from at least 10 members' offices had been helping
out through the weeklong vigil for word of Leland's whereabouts, and
after the sad news arrived early Sunday morning.
   Clara Pinzana, who is press secretary to Rep. Greg Laughlin,
D-Texas, said of Leland's own staff, ``They're doing really well.
They have burned the candle at both ends, but you wouldn't know it.''
   In Dallas, meanwhile, about 500 mourners gathered at the Peoples
Missionary Baptist Church for a memorial service sponsored by the
Interdenominational Ministers Alliance of Dallas.
   The Rev. S.M. Wright, president of the alliance, said Leland had
worked closely with many political and religious leaders in Dallas,
trying to solve statewide problems.
   ``He was like family to our elected officials here,'' Wright said.
   Meanwhile, hunger organizations that worked with Leland were
beginning to come forward with ideas for memorializing his work.
   One of them, Rev. Larry Jones, whose Feed the Children ministry
takes in about $40 million a year for international hunger projects,
said a feeding center in Ethiopia will be named for the congressman.
   ``I don't want what he stood for to die,'' said Jones, whose
non-profit organization is based in Oklahoma.
   An aide in the White House foreign press office said Monday that
a congressional and White House delegation that would be sent
accompany the remains of Leland and other Americans back to the
United States was ``currently on hold.''
   The bodies have to be recovered and identified, the aide said,
before a decision can be made on when the delegation would leave.
Four congressmen and two White House officials have been asked to
accompany the remains on their return home.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with other airlines cutting fares,
ADD background; picks up 6th graf, ```TWA wants ...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major U.S. airlines have cut roundtrip fares by
as much as $160 to attract passengers during the historically weak
fall season.
   TWA announced the initiative on Sunday. The reductions were
matched Monday by Pan Am Corp., USAir Group Inc., United Airlines,
Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines in
markets where they compete with TWA.
   American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, went one better
by matching the cuts for all mainland U.S. cities it serves, not
only those where it competes with TWA. American will also match
TWA's new fares to Europe on a competitive basis, said airline
spokesman Jim Brown.
   Pan Am did the same for international routes, cutting fares
across its entire overseas network except for the Soviet Union, said
Pan Am spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners in New York.
   Jim Lundy, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said the
Atlanta-based carrier was still studying the issue and expected to
make a decision Tuesday.
   The reduced fares are available through Sept. 1 for domestic
flights from Sept. 9 to Dec. 15 and international flights from Oct.
1 to May 21.
   Air fares had been steadily rising in recent months amid strong
passenger traffic and may have peaked for a while, industry analysts
say. Continental started a round of cuts Aug. 2 when it reduced to
$75 each way its weekend fares through Labor Day on most non-stops,
and lowered transcontinental fares to $100 each way.
   In an unusual arrangement in the latest fare-cutting, passengers
are allowed one change in travel dates. Discount fares normally
prohibit such changes. In addition, a ``lowest fare guarantee''
ensures that if the fares are reduced further after a ticket is
purchased, passengers will be refunded the difference.
   ``TWA wants to stimulate traffic during the historically weak
fall travel period, and passengers who act now will be getting a
great deal,'' said Robert Cozzi, TWA's senior vice president of
marketing.
   The offer covers more than 100 cities worldwide, he said.
Northwest said it would cut its fares to the same cities.
   Examples of TWA's new roundtrip fares for travel on Tuesday and
Wednesday are: St. Louis-Dallas, $148; New York-Los Angeles, $198;
Chicago-Denver, $168; San Antonio-Washington, $198.
   From New York to London, Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid and Rome, TWA
is cutting $100 off its previous roundtrip fares.
   Passengers must stay over on a Saturday night and tickets cannot
be refunded.

<HEAD>Brakeman on Derailed CSX Train Used Cocaine, Federal Agency Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREELAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brakeman on a chemical train that
derailed last month, forcing 3,000 people to flee, used cocaine
sometime in the 48 hours before the accident, a federal agency said
Monday.
   Blood and urine samples provided by the brakeman, who wasn't
identified, tested positive for cocaine, the Federal Railroad
Administration said in a news release. Samples provided by the
engineer and conductor tested negative.
   Railroad administration spokeswoman Claire H. Austin in
Washington, D.C., said the brakeman, whose name was withheld, was
riding on the lead locomotive of the 37-car CSX Transportation Co.
train when 14 cars derailed July 22.
   A fire that began in some of the derailed cars caused the
evacuation of about 3,000 people. Twelve people were injured.
   ``His role in the cause of the accident, if any, has yet to be
determined,'' Austin said.
   Two days after the accident, CSX spokesman R. Lindsay Leckie
announced that the brakeman admitted himself to a drug and alcohol
rehabilitation center.
   The federal agency also announced Monday that it will conduct a
safety audit of CSX's line between Midland and Toledo, Ohio. The
audit, which includes inspections and checks of maintenance
procedures, began Monday. A report is due Sept. 1.
   The National Transportation Safety Board discovered worn wheels
and brakes on the derailed train and found a variety of operating
violations.

<HEAD>Azcona Says Democratic Opening Exists In Nicaragua</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo said
Monday that moves toward democracy by Nicaragua's Sandinista
government allowed him to vote for disbanding that country's
U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The Honduras-based guerrillas, ``should understand that the
military option against Nicaragua was canceled in the Tela
meetings,'' Azcona said in reference to the Central American summit
in the Honduran port city last week.
   An accord, which was put together by Honduras and approved by the
five Central American presidents, calls for the rebels to be
repatriated in 120 days.
   Azcona's position is central to the accord's success because
Honduras has allowed the so-called Contras to operate from its
territory. If Honduras abides by the accords, the rebels will find
it difficult to survive.
   An agreement between the Nicaraguan government and its political
opponents shortly before the Tela summit ``weighed heavily in the
decision to approve the plan demobilizing the rebels,'' Azcona said.
``Nicaragua, undoubtedly, is experiencing a democratic opening.''
   Under the agreement, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega promised
fair elections in February and to end the draft. Ortega has also
granted an amnesty to all Nicaraguan rebels living in Honduras and
Nicaragua.
   The United States, which since last year has given only
humanitarian aid to the Contras, has said it will abide by the Tela
accord.
   But in Miami, a Contra leader reiterated that the rebels will not
lay down their weapons. Rebel leader Enrique Bermudez called for
Nicaraguan citizens to provide the rebels with aid.
   ``We call on peasants and workers in ... Nicaragua to support the
freedom fighters with food and clothes to maintain the struggle
against the Sandinista regime.''
   The peace accord calls for the United Nations and Organization of
American States to set up a verification commission within 30 days
to plan and monitor repatriation of the 11,000 Contras and 12,000
dependents living in Honduras. The Contras have fought the
Nicaraguan government since 1981, saying the Sandinistas betrayed
the ideals of the revolution that overthrew Anastasio Somoza in July
1979.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras agreed March 21 to suspend
offensive operations, but talks aimed at a permanent end to the
7-year-old war in which 50,000 people have died stand at an impasse.

<TEXT>
   A mental patient accused of fatally
stabbing a 9-year-old girl at a street fair after walking away from
a state hospital was found competent Monday to stand trial.
   Superior Court Judge Donald T. Dorsey accepted the unananimous
finding of competency by an examining panel made up of a
psychiatrist, psychologist and psychiatric social worker.
   The panel noted that David Peterson suffers from mental illness
and experiences delusions of persecution, but said the problems do
not compromise his ability to understand the charges against him and
to help in his own defense.
   Peterson, 37, had been committed to the state's care in 1988
after being found innocent by reason of insanity in the stabbing of
a neighbor in a rooming house.
   Peterson, who kept his eyes lowered during the 10-minute hearing,
was wearing a large bandage over his right hand and wrist. His
attorney, Assistant Public Defender Chris James, said he believed
Peterson had suffered the injury when he was arrested after the July
28 knife attack.
   Asked how Peterson has been acting since the slaying, James would
only say, ``He's a very sick young man.''
   James waived a hearing on the competency issue, but said he would
request that Peterson be re-examined before trial because competency
``is a day- to-day thing.''.
   The judge scheduled a probable cause hearing for Sept. 12.
Peterson was arrested on murder and weapons charges.
   Peterson walked off the grounds of Connecticut Valley Hospital in
Middletown on July 28, took a bus to downtown and bought a hunting
knife. He then went to a crowded street fair, where he attacked
9-year-old Jessica Short at random while her mother and several
other people looked on, police said.
   The attack lasted less than a minute, ending when police officers
and a bystander pulled Peterson away from the girl. She was stabbed
repeatedly in the face and chest and died less than an hour later.
   Peterson is now being held at the Whiting Forsensic Institute,
the maximum-security facility in Middletown for criminally insane
mental patients. Dorsey ordered that bond remain at $750,000.

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of raping and murdering a young
doctor from India was sentenced to the maximum prison term of 33 1-3
years to life on Monday.
   Dennis Scotto, 40, was convicted June 30 of second-degree murder
and rape in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn. In September 1987, he
entered the Brooklyn apartment of Sunita Movva, 24, sexually
attacked her, beat her with his fists and then stabbed her
repeatedly, according to trial testimony.
   Scotto ``caused unspeakable grief to the victim's family and
friends, who loved her dearly. This defendant deserved the maximum
sentence allowed, and I'm glad that is what he got,'' Brooklyn
District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman said after State Supreme Court
Justice Philip Lagana delivered the sentence.
   Scotto lived in an upstairs apartment with his mother. He had a
history of mental illness and had been arrested on nine previous
occasions, including five times for burglary.
   Ms. Movva and her husband, Sadasiva Katta, also a doctor, moved
from India to Chicago in 1986. They had lived in Brooklyn less than
a month when Ms. Movva was murdered. After the killing Katta moved
to Detroit.
   ``Whatever sentence is imposed ... she will not be returned to
me,'' Katta said in a letter read before the sentencing. ``But
please do not belittle the loss or devalue the worth of Sunita's
life, a young physician who could have served humanity.''

   Prosecutors on Monday dropped 12-year-old rape and
kidnapping charges against Gary Dotson, 10 years after he was
convicted on testimony later recanted by his accuser.
   Prosecutors took the action, which clears Dotson of any legal
wrongdoing in the case, immediately after a defense motion for a new
trial was granted by Circuit Judge Thomas R. Fitzgerald.
   Attorney Thomas Breen, saying high-tech genetic tests prove
Dotson's innocence, had asked Fitzgerald for a new trial.
   ``The only conclusion that can be drawn is that Gary Dotson was
convicted of a crime that never took place,'' Breen said outside the
courtroom.
   Prosecutors had contended that the test results were not enough
to clear Dotson, and that a new trial couldn't be granted unless it
was likely to reverse the outcome of the first one.
   ``I have my bitterness, yes. It's been hard to deal with,'' said
Dotson, convicted of rape and aggravated kidnapping in 1979 and
sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison for a 1977 attack on Cathleen
Crowell Webb.
   Six years later, Mrs. Webb recanted her testimony, a move that
led to clemency for Dotson.
   ``I forgave her a long time ago. I've no animosity against her,''
Dotson said.
   ``I'm sure she's very relieved that it's done,'' the Rev. Carl
Nannini, a Dublin, N.H., Baptist minister who acts as Mrs. Webb's
spokesman, said in an interview.
   Although Nannini said Mrs. Webb had not known about Monday's
action when he talked to her earlier in the day, the minister said
Mrs. Webb has contacts in Chicago who have kept her current on
developments in the case.
   Breen contended that genetic test results prove that semen found
on the underpants worn by Mrs. Webb on the night she said she was
raped in July 1977 did not come from Dotson.
   In August 1988, Edward Blake of Forensic Science Associates in
Richmond, Calif., examined the underwear and concluded Dotson
couldn't have been among the 5 percent of men whose genetic pattern
matched cells found in the stain _ a finding supported by a British
expert at the University of Leicester.
   The stain was a key piece of evidence in the prosecution's case.
   When she recanted her testimony in 1985, Mrs. Webb _ now a
Harrisville, N.H., homemaker _ said she invented the attack because
she feared she had become pregnant by her boyfriend.
   Gov. James R. Thompson granted Dotson clemency that year, saying
his punishment had been sufficient. But the governor has refused to
pardon Dotson, saying he did not believe Mrs. Webb's reversal.
   When Thompson heard the court news Monday, he ``was happy that
the whole thing is over,'' said David Fields, a spokesman for the
governor.
   ``He was frustrated that he gave Mr. Dotson repeated
opportunities and something always happened,'' Fields said.
   Dotson, 32, who has married and become a father since his
release, was paroled last August after recurring minor problems with
the law returned him to prison. He has been living in an alcohol and
drug treatment center under terms of his parole.

   U.S. Rep. Larkin Smith, a former
sheriff known for his strong law-and-order stance, was found dead
Monday with his pilot in the wreckage of a small plane that crashed
in a forest.
   The freshman Republican, whose plane disappeared Sunday evening
during a 90-mile flight from Hattiesburg to Gulfport, became the
second congressmen in as many weeks to die in an air accident.
   Rescuers spotted the wreckage of the single-engine Cessna 177
from the air about 8 a.m. Monday. Searchers had to bulldoze their
way to the wreckage in the thickly wooded DeSoto National Forest 14
miles south of here, authorities said.
   ``The plane was all to pieces,'' said Perry County Deputy Sheriff
Gene McRee. ``It appeared it centered a big pine tree. There was no
way anyone could have survived.''
   The plane's engine appeared to have been dead when it crashed,
said Dr. Michael West, deputy medical examiner for neighboring
Forrest County. West said there was no sign of fire or smell of
gasoline at the crash site.
   Smith, 45, was elected to Congress last November from the 5th
District, taking the seat of fellow Republican Trent Lott, who ran
successfully for the U.S. Senate. Before his election, Smith was
sheriff of Harrison County and, before that, police chief of
Gulfport.
   Gov. Ray Mabus ordered state flags to be flown at half-staff,
saying Smith ``had dedicated his life to public service.'' Smith's
seat will be filled by special election.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater read this
statement:
   ``President and Mrs. Bush deeply regret the news of the death of
Congressman Larkin Smith. The president knew and supported
Congressman Smith during his election to a seat vacated by Sen.
Trent Lott. Congressman Smith was just beginning a promising career
in the Congress.''
   Earlier Sunday, word had come from Ethiopia that the wreckage of
a plane carrying Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and 15 other people
had been found with no survivors. The plane disappeared Aug. 7 on a
flight to a remote village. Searchers on Monday began efforts to
recover the bodies.
   Smith and his pilot, Chuck Vierling, left Hattiesburg shortly
after 9 p.m. Sunday after Smith had thrown out the first baseball at
the Dixie Youth World Series. John Walker, a spokesman for the
congressman, said the plane went off radar at 9:25 p.m.
   Skies were reported clear in the area Sunday night, but former
Hattiesburg Mayor Bobby Chain said he flew in just before the crash
and there was a thick haze at 5,000 feet, making it ``easy for a
pilot to lose his horizons.''
   Dozens of military, civilian and law enforcement rescuers
searched for the plane after a resident reported that he thought he
heard a plane crash.
   ``My wife was preparing to go to bed, and we heard a plane coming
over,'' said the man, Lamar Breland. ``I thought at the time it was
unusal for a plane to be in the area at night.'' Breland said he
heard a ``revving sound, and then a crash.''
   The wreckage was first spotted Monday morning by a U.S. Customs
Service aircraft. The bodies were thrown from the wreckage, which
was shattered except for part of the tail section, authorities said.
   A Federal Aviation Administration investigator was on the scene.
   In his seven months in Congress, Smith had co-sponsored
legislation to strengthen federal drug law enforcement, and
criticized federal drug czar William Bennett for backing a ban on
semi-automatic assault weapons from other countries.
   He once took fellow Judiciary Committee members to an FBI
shooting range to demonstrate his belief that shotguns were just as
dangerous as assault weapons. He claimed 90 percent of crimes were
committed with pistols and shotguns.
   He advocated making death penalty laws uniform across the
country, eliminating paroles and early release for dangerous
criminals, and streamlining the federal appeals process, which he
called ``never-ending.''
   ``He was so happy and enjoying being a member of Congress,'' said
Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., who had joined Smith at
opening ceremonies at youth baseball series. ``He was doing a super
job as a member. He had emerged as one of the real leaders in the
freshman class of the 101st Congress.
   ``Our last conversation at the series was talking about the loss
of Congressman Leland, and I told Larkin that he should be careful
in traveling and performing his duties.''
   Six other congressmen have died in plane crashes since 1972.
Majority Leader Hale Boggs, D-Louisiana, and Rep. Nick Begich,
D-Alaska, died when their plane disappeared over Alaska in Oct. 16,
1972. Rep. George W. Collins, D-Illinois, was one of 45 people who
died Dec. 8, 1972, in the crash of a United Airlines jet in Chicago.
   Rep. Jerry Pettis, R-Calif., died in a private plane crash in
Banning, Calif. Rep. Jerry Litton, D-Mo., was killed Aug. 3, 1976 in
a private plane at Chillicothe, Mo., Municipal Airport shortly after
take-off. And on Sept. 1, 1983, Rep. Larry McDonald, D-Georgia, was
one of 269 people who died when the Soviets shot down a Korean
Airlines jet in Soviet airspace.
   In addition to the Judiciary committee, Smith was a member of the
House Government Operations committee and on task forces
concentrating on defense, crime and the savings and loan industry.
   He began his career in law enforcement in 1966. In 1977, he was
appointed police chief in Gulfport.
   Then in 1983, running as a reform candidate, he defeated
incumbent Leroy Hobbs to take over the scandal-ridden Harrison
County Sheriff's Department. Hobbs eventually was convicted of
racketeering and drug charges.
   Smith is survived by his wife, Sheila; a daughter; and a grandson.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

   Two bombs, one in
Londonderry and the other in Belfast, exploded late Monday amid
scattered rioting marking 20 years since British troops arrived in
Northern Ireland.
   Police issued a statement saying the Londonderry bomb was thrown
at an armored police Land Rover and the blast rocked the vehicle and
broke windows in nearby homes but injured no one.
   The Belfast bomb, also apparently aimed at security forces,
exploded in the Roman Catholic Ardoyne district, according to
police. They gave no details.
   In sporadic rioting, IRA supporters threw rocks and gasoline
bombs at police, who responded with plastic bullets. Police said two
demonstrators were injured but that their conditions were not
serious.
   Earlier, marchers paraded through downtown Londonderry chanting
``IRA! IRA!'' as they passed police patrols and the ruins of a bar
destroyed two days earlier by an Irish Republican Army bomb.
   During the day in Belfast, police fired plastic bullets to
disperse youths who set fire to at least four vehicles in scattered
violence. Police said there were no injuries.
   In this northern city where ``the troubles'' began, several
thousand people joined the march from Creggan, a Catholic district,
down through the Bogside, the Catholic area where fighting with
police prompted the dispatch of British troops on Aug. 14, 1969.
   Marchers went down the hill to the ``Free Derry'' corner at the
edge of the Bogside, with its sign saying ``You Are Now Entering
Free Derry.''
   The pub was left in ruins by a bomb that exploded four hours
before the huge annual Protestant march Saturday commemorating the
end of the Catholic siege of Derry 300 years ago. No one was injured.
   Central Londonderry was sealed off Monday after police noticed
two suspicious beer barrels, but reopened after midday when it was
concluded to be a hoax.
   Armored military Land Rovers blocked streets that were closed to
the march.
   The rally after the parade illustrated divisions within Northern
Ireland's Catholic minority. Only one speaker mentioned the Rev. Ian
Paisley, the Protestant militant, but four denounced John Hume,
leader of the largest Catholic political party.
   ``We've all risked our lives for 20 years, and I say fight on!''
said Martin McGuinness, vice president of Sinn Fein, the legal
political wing of the outlawed IRA.
   Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, a protest leader in the 1960s and
70s, urged continued organizing toward unification of Ireland as a
``32-county workers' republic.''
   She said she wanted democracy, equality and the right to say what
she thought without fear, and ``nobody can give them to me as a
present in a wee box. ... John Hume can't negotiate them.''
   It was a quiet and orderly crowd of 5,000 to 6,000. After the
speeches there was a large bonfire of scrap wood, discarded
furniture and tires.
   Opponents of the marchers within the Catholic community stayed
home.
   The division among Irish nationalists has been as persistent and
difficult to heal as the Protestant-Catholic split at the root of
the years of violence.
   Both the Social Democratic and Labor Party and Sinn Fein advocate
a united Ireland, but Sinn Fein backs the IRA's violent campaign
against British rule of the province. The SDLP advocates peaceful
change, saying more innocent civilians have been killed by the IRA
than by security forces.
   Londonderry was a focus of Catholic civil rights marches a
generation ago. Protestants were a majority in the province, but a
minority in Londonderry and resorted to gerrymandering and job and
housing discrimination there to keep control.
   It is revered by Protestants as the town where their ancestors
withstood a Catholic-led siege in 1689. Their annual commemorative
parade sparked the violence in 1969.
   ``History shows that oppression gives rise to resistance. The
only way to end the violence is to end the injustice,'' McGuinness
wrote in a 20th anniversary edition of the Derry Journal newspaper.
   ``The use of armed struggle for the IRA, supported by a large
section of the nationalist community, is as natural as the use of
violence by the defenders of the Bogside 20 years ago.''
   Hume, the Catholic political leader, said the IRA has caused many
of the province's troubles.
   ``We have emergency legislation. We have troops on our streets.
We have young people being continually stopped and searched. We have
house searches. We have checkpoints. We have prisons full of young
people,'' he wrote in the Derry Journal.
   ``Every man and woman in the street knows one simple way to end
those problems. If the IRA ended their physical force campaign
tomorrow and devoted themselves to peaceful means alone, then in a
matter of weeks the troops would be gone from streets.''
   Hume has defeated McGuinness twice in parliamentary elections. In
1987, the vote was 23,743 to 8,707.
   More than 2,740 people, two-thirds of them civilians, have been
killed in Northern Ireland since 1969 and dozens have died in
attacks in Britain, the Irish Republic and continental Europe.

   A 7-year-old boy who found a handgun in
the trunk of his uncle's car wounded a 5-year-old playmate Monday
while the boys were imitating the movie ``Robocop,'' police said.
   Ronelis Frendeles was in guarded condition at Bethesda Memorial
Hospital with gunshot wounds to both legs, said police spokeswoman
Lori Nedzweckas.
   The 7-year-old child told officers he found his uncle's
.38-caliber handgun and it went off while the boys were imitating
``Robocop,'' a violent movie about a half-man, half-robot
``supercop.''
   The shooting remained under investigation, police said.
   A recently passed state law, which takes effect Oct. 1, is
designed to deter just such a shooting in the wake of the
liberalization of Florida's gun laws.
   Under the new law, adults can be charged with a felony,
punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine, if a
child shoots himself or another because of the owner's carelessness.

   A wooden boat carrying 137 Vietnamese refugees
arrived in southern Japan early Monday and officials said they would
be transferred to Japan's only refugee reception center, which is
already overcrowded.
   The 66-foot boat with 112 men and 25 women aboard was discovered
near the Goto Islands 610 miles southwest of Tokyo, said Masataka
Sasahara, a spokesman for the Maritime Safety Agency.
   No injuries or sickness were reported among the group and
Sasahara said the boat people were resting in a tent set up by a
local village office.
   He said the Vietnamese told officials they had left the northern
port of Haiphong on June 25 but he had no further details.
   Sasahara said the boat people would be moved to Nagasaki for
health examinations and an immigration inspection before being
transferred to the nearby Omura Temporary Refugee Reception Center.
The reception center is overcrowded with 415 refugees waiting to be
granted permanent residence in Japan or to be accepted by other
countries, the agency spokesman said.
   Hisao Nishino, deputy director at the center, said the facility
has a capacity of 200 people and ``it is impossible to receive any
more.''
   The increase in the number of Indochinese refugees this year has
raised concern and some government officials have said Japan will
have to provide more facilities to house and process them.
   Refugee officials said 1,262 Indochinese arrived this year
compared to only 187 in 1988.
   ``It's just too much, and the government should do something
about it right now,'' Nishino said.

<TEXT>
   The brother-in-law of former Mexican President
Luis Echeverria was flown here from Texas on Monday and ordered held
without bail as a material witness in the 1985 torture-slaying of a
U.S. drug agent.
   Several informants have named Ruben Zuno-Arce as a major drug
trafficker in Guadalajara, Mexico, and have indicated he talked
about U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena's murder, said a government
affidavit filed with the arrest warrant for Zuno-Arce.
   Zuno-Arce's attorney and friend, Jeremiah Handy of San Antonio,
said his client is a successful Mexican businessman who deals in
lumber and vegetables, and has no history of drug trafficking.
   Zuno-Arce, a resident of Mascota, Mexico, was arrested Wednesday
in San Antonio by U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, who issued the arrest
warrant last week, said he would hold a bail hearing next Monday and
ordered Zuno-Arce held without bond until then.
   Handy said not setting bail on a prisoner who has not been
charged was unusual, but ``this is an unusual case.''
   The kidnapping and torture-slaying of Camarena and his pilot,
Alfredo Zavala-Avelar, turned into an international incident. The
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has vowed to pursue every
person involved in the killings.
   Several members of the Mexican federal police force were linked
to the slayings. One, Raul Lopez Alvarez, was convicted in Los
Angeles last year with two drug traffickers.
   Earlier Monday, a police officer from the western Mexican state
of Jalisco was arraigned in Los Angeles on an indictment charging
him with kidnapping, murder, racketeering and being an accessory
after the fact.
   The officer, Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, pleaded innocent to the
charges, and his trial was tentatively set for Oct. 3.
   Bernabe was arrested July 27 as he was about to return to Mexico.
According to a DEA affidavit filed at the time of his arrest,
Bernabe told two undercover DEA agents he was present when reputed
Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro-Quintero tortured Camarena.
   Camarena and Zavala-Avelar were killed after the agent led a
series of damaging raids on marijuana plantations allegedly operated
by Caro-Quintero, authorities have said.
   Camarena's body was found on a ranch 65 miles southeast of
Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco.
   Seven more men are charged with murder and conspiracy in the
case, including Caro-Quintero, who is in custody awaiting trial in
Mexico City.
   Camarena and Zavela-Avelar are believed to have been killed at
Caro-Quintero's Guadalajara home. The arrest warrant for Zuno-Arce
identifies him as the former owner of the home.
   Handy, however, said his client does not know Caro-Quintero
``except as a name in the paper like anyone else.''
   Zuno-Arce has been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand
jury in Los Angeles on Aug. 23, and the government is seeking his
testimony at Bernabe's trial.
   The affidavit signed by DEA Special Agent Abel Reynoso said
investigators believe Zuno-Arce is a major drug trafficker in the
Guadalajara area.
   The affidavit said it was suspected Zuno-Arce may have been a
witness to ``events surrounding the kidnapping and murder of special
agent Camarena.''
   Zuno-Arce is the brother of Echeverria's wife. Members of his
family attended Monday's court session. Echeverria was president of
Mexico from 1970 to 1976.

   British and Argentine officials are holding
talks this week on restoring diplomatic and trade relations for the
first time since the 1982 Falklands War, authorities said Monday.
   Argentina's willingness to temporarily set aside its claim over
the Falkland Islands led to the diplomatic breakthrough, officials
said, speaking with the condition of anonymity.
   None of the officials involved would provide details of the talks
under way in New York.
   But one diplomat said ``we cannot deny that the situation is very
dynamic, and something could happen in the next few days or weeks.''
   Diplomatic relations were severed in April 1982 when Argentina
invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands, a British colony since
1833. British forces recaptured the islands off Argentina's southern
coast in a 74-day war.
   Argentines call the islands the Malvinas and claim they inherited
them in 1810 after declaring independence from Spain.
   Argentina never formally declared an end to hostilities in the
Falklands War. It has refused to allow British planes or ships to
use Argentine ports or to allow British companies to bid on
Argentine public projects.
   Argentina also banned British products from its markets but
lifted restrictions earlier this month. Britain earlier removed a
similar ban on Argentine imports.
   Britain has said it wants to normalize trade relations with
Argentina, negotiate a fishing agreement, re-establish air links and
reduce tension.
   Argentina's new president, Carlos Menem, took the first step
toward restoring ties shortly after his inauguration in early July.
Previously, Argentina had said talks would have to start with the
sovereignty issue.
   Menem's government would like to recover fishing rights in the
area around the Falklands. Britain currently enforces a 150-mile
exclusion zone around the islands.

   A man convicted of West Virginia's
biggest bank robbery and in jail-escape and murder-for-hire plots
was sentenced Monday to life in prison plus 43 years.
   John P. McCoy, 43, of Slater's Branch, Ky., also was fined
$250,000 by U.S. District Judge Charles Haden II and ordered to make
restitution if proceeds from the bank robbery are found.
   McCoy also was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Robert Staker to
nine years and fined $12,500 on counterfeiting and conspiracy
convictions. The prison sentences are to be served concurrently.
   An accomplice, David Doyle Moore, 39, of Forest Hill, Ky., was
convicted in the holdup. Harden sentenced Moore to 29 years and
three months in prison, the maximum for robbery, conspiracy and
intimidating a witness.
   McCoy, who stood trial three times this summer, was convicted of
robbing the Matewan National Bank branch in Kermit of $286,000 in
January 1987, killing an accomplice, threatening and intimidating
federal witnesses, counterfeiting $800,000 in U.S. currency,
plotting a jail escape and hiring a contract killer.
   Despite being convicted on all but one count, McCoy said he
believed each of his convictions would be overturned on appeal.
   ``I feel very comfortable that it (the truth) will come to show
itself,'' McCoy said last week in an interview in federal prison in
Ashland, Ky.
   Haden sentenced McCoy to more time than was recommended under
uniform sentencing guidelines established in 1987.
   ``The court feels the guidelines really did not contemplate this
much criminal conduct out of one person,'' said Haden, who rejected
Moore's request that he be released on bond pending his appeal.
   McCoy claimed prosecutors and Haden were angry because he fought
them through legal services work he began after serving two years in
prison for mail fraud in the early 1980s.
   ``They've taken thieves, chauvinists and prosecutors to come
after me. The honorable Judge Haden has not afforded me the first
iota of justice,'' McCoy said.
   McCoy was convicted in June of the bank robbery, the subsequent
murder of accomplice Russell Davis, two conspiracy counts and the
threatening of federal witnesses.
   Davis' sister, Angie Dobson, traveled from her home in Pensacola,
Fla., to witness the sentencing.
   ``It was worth it,'' she said. ``I think he's been proven
guilty.''
   In July, McCoy and his girlfriend, Debbie Farley, 36, of Fort Gay
were convicted of counterfeiting conspiracy. McCoy also was
convicted of counterfeiting. They used a color photocopying maching
to make what federal agents said were relatively poor copies of U.S.
and Canadian currency.
   Two weeks ago, McCoy and three others, including his 21-year-old
son, Kennis, were convicted of hiring a man to kill witnesses and
family members. No one was killed or injured. McCoy also was
convicted of concocting a jail-escape plot that failed.

   The Protestant cry of ``no
surrender'' had echoes on the Roman Catholic side as Northern
Ireland today marked 20 years of living with British troops.
   ``We have a lot to be proud of because we have come a long way
in 20 years. Our opponents have failed to defeat us,'' Gerry Adams
told thousands of cheering supporters who marched up the Falls Road
in West Belfast on Sunday.
   Adams is president of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, and he praised the IRA as ``the
real freedom fighters.''
   The republican parade came a day after a big Protestant parade
in Londonderry to mark the 300th anniversary of the breaking of the
Catholic King James II's siege of the city.

   Four congressmen plan to accompany Rep. Mickey
Leland's body back to the United States after it is retrieved from
the wreckage of a plane crash in Ethiopia, while President Bush
says he is ``truly saddened'' by ``this tragic accident.''
   The president said Sunday the Texas Democrat and his 15
companions were ``engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the
hungry'' when their plane crashed after taking off from Addis Ababa
for a refugee camp near the Sudan border.
   After learning that the plane was found Sunday on a remote
Ethiopian mountain 100 miles from its destination, Bush asked two
White House officials to accompany a congressional team that will
bring the bodies of Leland and eight other Americans back to the
United States.
   An administration official said a decision on when the
delegation would leave Washington would hinge on the identification
of the bodies.

   More than 190,000 telephone employees were on strike nationwide
today after workers in five Midwestern states joined the walkout.
But two regional telephone companies reached settlements to keep
83,000 workers on the job.
   About 35,000 members of the Communications Workers of America
went on strike Sunday against Chicago-based Ameritech, which serves
12.3 million customers in the Midwest.
   They joined more than 156,000 operators, installers and other
employees at three other ``Baby Bells'' _ NYNEX, Bell Atlantic, and
Pacific Telesis _ who entered the second week of their walkout
today.
   There were few signs of progress in resolving any of the
disputes, which center on wages and company plans to cut back
health benefits.
   Nevertheless, the CWA reached agreement Sunday with U S West,
which serves 14 western states, and with Southwestern Bell

   Echoes of the Woodstock festival reverberate in
American society 20 years after the counterculture concert rocked
the nation. But when it comes to rock 'n' roll itself, most people
say the tune's gone flat.
   Eight in 10 American adults have heard of the Woodstock
festival, held Aug. 15-17, 1969, on a muddy farm in upstate New
York _ and three in 10 of them wish they had attended, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   That high level of awareness was rooted in a view of Woodstock
as more of a historical milestone than simply a show. Most regard
it as the expression of a social movement, and half of them said
that movement continues today.
   Yet the view of Woodstock was not an idealized one. While nearly
six in 10 of those who knew of the festival said it has had a
lasting effect on American society, only half of them said the
effect was a positive one.

in five continents on Wednesday when the full moon orbits into the
shadow of the Earth and slowly turns from a bright silver into a
copper or orange disk.
   More than a billion people in the western hemisphere will have a
chance to watch as the moon appears to be slowly nibbled away,
changing from the normal bright reflected light of a full moon into
the colorful glow of eclipse.
   The celestial show starts at 8:23 p.m. EDT over the United
States and will end about 5{ hours later. The eastern United States
will get the best viewing and Alaska will miss the eclipse
altogether.
   Visible eclipse phases will vary for the central and western
parts of the country because of the difference in sunset and
moonrise. In Los Angeles, for instance, the eclipse will have
started before the sun has set or the moon has risen. By the time
the sky has darkened completely in California, the moon will
already be in the deepest part of its eclipse. For Seattle, the
moon will still be below the horizon at mid-eclipse, but will rise
during the totality phase.

   Postal workers who tested positive for drug
use were more prone to absenteeism and getting fired, according to
a new study that could give private employers an indication of the
cost of workers' drug use.
   The analysis, one of the first studies of its kind, found that
drug users had a 41 percent higher absence rate and about a 40
percent higher rate of being fired, said researcher Jacques Normand.
   Results suggest that by spending about $1.8 million a year to
screen job applicants for drugs, the post office could avoid about
$3.1 million in costs related to absenteeism and firing in the
first year, he said. Over three years, the avoided costs would
surpass $17 million, he said.
   For private employers, the study provides hard data showing that
drug screening results are related to later job performance, he
said.

   Linford Schultz and four companions
are taking a walk _ 30,000 miles across the world. They figure
it'll take them about four years.
   They've been under way since May, starting out from Georgetown,
Guyana, home of their Continent-to-Continent Adventure Club.
   ``We've had a bit of activity,'' said Lawrence Renville, the
27-year-old second in command after Schultz and the walk's chief
diarist.
   The purpose is manifold: to commemorate the 500th anniversary in
1992 of Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New World; the 400th
anniversary of the arrival of African slaves in the Western
Hemisphere, and the 23rd anniversary of the independence of Guyana,
their homeland.
   Their route will take them across the northern tip of South
America, through Central America and Mexico, across Texas and the
Gulf States and up the East Coast to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in
Canada. From there the group will cross the Atlantic by ship to
Ireland and cross Europe to Greece. They'll sail across the
Mediterannean to the Middle East and walk to Pakistan and India.
Then it will be by boat across the Indian Ocean to Africa.
   Their goal to reach is Goree Island near Dakar, Senegal, in
northwest Africa by 1992, the anniversary of Columbus' discovery of
America.
   But Goree was the transhipment point for most of the slave trade
that reached what now is Guyana, formerly British Guiana, on the
northern shoulder of South America.
   ``We might stay awhile and do some exploring before we come
home,'' said the 48-year-old Schultz, explaining why the group
might not be back to Guyana until 1993.
   Long walks are not new to Schultz _ he walked from Central
America to New York City in 1968 _ but for others in his group, the
four years away from loved ones was not an easy choice.
   ``My girlfriend was sad, but there's some things a man's got to
do,'' said 24-year-old Gerald Gonsalves.
   The walking party already has had a brush with trouble.
   After setting out from Georgetown on May 26, the 23rd
anniversary of Guyana's independence, the group hiked 300 miles to
the town of Wauna, on the Venezuelan border. There they arranged
with Warao Indians to use two shallow canoes to paddle up the
Cuyubini River to Curiapa at the mouth of te Orinoco River in
Venezuela.
   But the canoe in Schultz's command capsized in the wake of a
passing motorboat, pitching the occupants into the
crocodile-infested river and sending some $2,000 worth of
photographic and camping equipment to the bottom.
   The group continued on, however, and made it to Caracas, where
they have started a fund-raising effort to finance the next leg of
the trip _ up Central America to the United States.
   ``We've attracted some interest from private individuals and
charitable organizations,'' said Renville, a former insurance
salesman who said he had to quit his job because his boss refused
to give him four years off.
   The YMCA in Caracas is providing the group accommodations in
exchange for voluntary work, such as talking about their
experiences with schoolchildren, and cleaning up the grounds.
   ``By the time we reach the States we hope to have a camper,''
Schultz said.
   The idea is to send the camper ahead with the group's equipment
while they hike during the day with local organizations, promoting
friendship and motivating others to seek adventure.
   ``In the past there was a great demand for adventure,'' said
Schultz. ``In fact, it was the basis for settling the New World.
Today we have trips to the moon. But what we are doing is exploring
the minds of our neighbors. This is the most exciting thing we can
do.''
   The group was assembled from the different ethnic groups that
make up society Guyana _ white, black, Asian, Amerindian and
mulatto.
   The other two in the group are Compton Ferguson, 48, a former
merchant seaman, and Troy Dasraph, 24.
   Schultz and Ferguson started out together for the walk to New
York in 1968, but Ferguson dropped out after going part of the way.
Schultz wrote a book _ ``Continent to Continent'' _ about that walk.
   ``We didn't see each other for 18 years,'' Schultz said of
Ferguson. ``Now we are back on the road with these new guys. They
are green but someday they will be able to look back with pride on
the journey.''
   Schultz added: ``When you embark on a mission like this, it's
always like finding your way in the dark, but there are always
helping hands out there that make it worthwhile. But we have to be
careful in some countries in Latin America where the political
situation is dangerous.''
   The group plans on crossing into the United States sometime in
the late fall and wintering over before continuing up the East
Coast to Canada and on into Europe.
   Once back home in Guyana, the group plans to write a book.

   He's still entitled to any sturgeon caught off
London Bridge and the password to the Tower, but gone are the days
when London's Lord Mayors roused the rabble and played banker to
the king.
   Celebrating the 800th anniversary of his office this year,
today's Lord Mayor, Christopher Collett, stays well away from
politics in ruling his now-tiny domain, called the City, at the
heart of ancient London.
   Yet while bereft of his predecessors' powers, the Lord Mayor is
not an empty figurehead. As representative of the City of London,
the one-square mile financial district, the mayor is an ambassador
for big business and, like the monarch, a symbol of the history
Britons cherish.
   ``People, even Britons, think the Lord Mayor is like Ed Koch or
Jacques Chirac,'' said Tony Travers, head of a London School of
Economics research group on capital government, speaking of the
mayors of New York and Paris. ``The contrast could not be greater.''
   London's only mayor _ the rest of the city has none _ ``does all
the things that a marketing department might do,'' Travers said.
   ``Certainly the emphasis has changed,'' Lord Mayor Collett said
from under a three-cornered hat in a spare moment at a public
appearance. ``We're now left as the titular head.''
   Like all the 660 mayors before him, Collett, an accountant, is a
wealthy man with ties to business. Mayors are nominated by members
of the City's ancient trade guilds and elected by aldermen. They
serve for a year.
   Early mayors often used their wealth to lend money to the crown
or pay court expenses and received in return favors ranging from
tax exemptions to gifts of royal venison.
   Merchant Henry FitzAilwyn, the first lord mayor, was also the
longest serving, with 20 years in office.
   Lord mayors had to pay expenses so weighty that men often chose
to pay fines rather than serve and in 1554, a law was passed
allowing mayors to cut down the number of courses served at their
feasts. Modern mayors still subsidize their terms, although they
receive entertainment allowances.
   Yet ample money did not always ensure good relations with the
crown, writes Valerie Hope, author of ``My Lord Mayor,'' a history
of the office published this year.
   Thomas FitzThomas _ one of the early rabble rousers _ landed in
prison for heading a rebellion against City aristocrats. Many of
his successors, particularly in the 18th century, were radicals,
some siding with the American colonists against George III.
   Most famous was John Wilkes, whose criticism of George III
brought him a prison sentence, which a mob tried to prevent.
Another, Brackley Kennett, was sentenced for exacerbating an
anti-Catholic riot in 1780.
   By this time the mayor wore quite a few hats.
   ``He arbitrated disputes between citizens or merchants, could
dispatch people to prison and sat as a justice,'' City Archivist
Jim Sewell said in an interview. ``He might have gone 'round to the
market and told poulterers off if they were overpricing'' or seized
fishing nets banned in the River Thames.
   The Lord Mayor is still the City's chief magistrate and can
preside at his official residence, Mansion House, in the ``Justice
Room.''
   A whirlwind of tree-plantings, business promotions, lunches,
meetings and trips, sometimes abroad, also occupies today's mayor,
who wears a medieval-looking costume of lacy shirt, flowing robe
and gold chain.
   His closest brushes with politics are hosting annual banquets,
where the prime minister and head of the Treasury make major
speeches, and presiding over meetings of the Common Council, the
City's administrative body.
   Added to Collett's duties this year have been anniversary
celebrations, from cutting a seven-foot-high birthday cake to an
extra special Lord Mayor's show, the mayor's popular election
parade.
   Dame Mary Donaldson, the only woman to hold the post, says she
gave 600 speeches and worked 17-hour days during her year in office
in 1983.
   ``You do have to submerge to a certain extent your own
personality,'' said the perky Dame Mary, a member of the
``Worshipful Company of Gardeners'' guild. ``Any thought of having
a personal life is just out.''
   Periodic efforts have been made to reform the City, which is
criticized as anachronistic with its medieval-era boundaries and
government dominated by business interests, said Travers.
   But he added, ``I can't imagine the Lord Mayor being abolished.
It's rather like Buckingham Palace and all those ceremonial
things.''

   When a medical emergency arises on the set of a
movie, it's not always part of the script.
   So when Dr. James D'Orta is not setting a broken bone at
Baltimore's Franklin Square Hospital or patching up a shooting
victim at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, the
emergency medicine specialist usually can be found on location.
   D'Orta is the founder of LifeStar International, a
Washington-based medical consulting firm that expands the walls of
the emergency room to movie sets.
   He and his colleagues have provided advance planning and
emergency medical care on the set for three recent movies:
``Licence to Kill'' and Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``Total Recall,''
both filmed in Mexico City; and ``The Abyss,'' an underwater
thriller filmed in an abandoned nuclear power plant that was
converted into a film studio in Gaffney, S.C.
   ``We're like the sprinkler heads in skyscrapers,'' said D'Orta.
``Producers with vision can see the necessity of taking preventive
measures to ensure the safety of their crews. It's several hundreds
of millions of dollars of movie budgets that we're protecting.''
   According to the New York-based Center for Safety in the Arts,
more than 1,000 injuries are reported each year in the U.S. film
industry, and since 1980, at least 19 people have been killed in
helicopter accidents on movie sets. Actor Vic Morrow and two
children were killed in 1982 during the filming of ``Twilight Zone:
The Movie,'' and five people died during the filming of Chuck
Norris' ``Delta Force 2,'' in the Philippines last May.
   D'Orta, 38, started the company after accompanying his
producer-cousin, Albert ``Cubby'' Broccoli, to Morocco to film
another James Bond movie, ``The Living Daylights,'' released by
United Artists in 1987.
   It was D'Orta's job to keep the new James Bond, Timothy Dalton,
and the rest of the cast and crew in good health while the movie
was filmed in the oasis of Ouarzazate, in the Sahara Desert. Time
lost on the set because of injuries or illness cost more than
$250,000 per day, or about $500 per minute. The doctor's work also
took him off the film set and into what he described as ``a
real-life James Bond drama.''
   He was approached in the desert by soldiers who were seeking
help for the victim of a motorcycle accident, the guard to the
prince of Bahrain.
   ``They said, `The prince will give you anything if you will come
and help us,''' D'Orta said. ``When we got there, the prince was
begging me to help the man and the guy was lying unconscious on the
street. He had a blood clot on the brain.''
   To the amazement of passersby, D'Orta inserted an intravenous
needle and hooked the patient to a cardiac monitor. The 007
airplane was summoned to take the guard to a hospital in Rabat,
Morocco.
   Mission accomplished, D'Orta left the hospital, but was stopped
by soldiers demanding his passport.
   ``I told them, `It's back in the desert on the movie set,'''
D'Orta said. ``They put me in a room where I sat and drank tea for
six hours until the king gave permission for me to leave.''
   D'Orta's patient recovered after surgery.
   ``If it weren't for Jimmy, I don't think he would have lived,''
said Michael G. Wilson, who produced and wrote the Bond flick.
``It's that kind of response that is very important to us, so when
it came time to film our next movie, we wanted him back.''
   D'Orta drafted Dr. Craig Feied, an emergency physician at George
Washington University Medical Center in Washington, and Vincent
Young, a Harvard business graduate, and founded LifeStar.
   D'Orta, Feied and a network of hundreds of emergency physicians
throughout the country have traveled to movie sets in such places
as the Philippines, Austria, Tangiers, Mexico and the Soviet Union.
In addition to motion pictures, the company also provided medical
consultation for Amnesty International's 1988 Human Rights Now!
concert tour, which performed in major cities all over the world.
   D'Orta also helped coordinate emergency medical teams after the
1985 earthquake in Mexico City, and was part of a group of
physicians who traveled to the Soviet Union after last fall's
earthquake in Armenia.
   ``The thing that makes us different from other entrepreneurs and
businessmen is that we truly practice medicine,'' D'Orta said.
``That gives us more credibility.''
   LifeStar uses computer links to the World Health Organization,
the Centers for Disease Control and the State Department to analyze
everything from rumors of unrest in Grenada to reports of a new
outbreak of resistant malaria in Zambia. The company checks each
person's immunizations, types their blood and has access to blood
that has been screened to be disease-free by U.S. and British
standards.
   Because many medications in the United States don't have exact
equivalents in other countries, LifeStar sends along a well-stocked
portable pharmacy. Detailed plans are made for rapid transport to
medical facilities in the event of injury or illness, and once the
filming begins, LifeStar physicians remain on the set.
   LifeStar's prices vary depending on the size of the production
and the risks and planning required, Young said.
   ``Any major film production can afford us,'' Young said. ``If
you compare what it costs for our services with what it would cost
without our services, it is free or very cheap for film producers.''
   Wilson agreed.
   ``It's a reasonable expense and it's worthwhile because they do
an excellent job and can turn a disaster into no time lost,'' he
said. ``When Tim (Dalton) cut his finger (during the making of
`Licence to Kill'), if we'd had to stop filming to take him to the
hospital, we would have lost at least half a day of filming. That
could mean anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000.
   ``But we had a doctor on the set who could stitch him up
immediately. We think Tim got better quality medical care and we
were able to go right on filming.''
   Lee Proimos, of Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., a Los
Angeles-based firm that insures 60 to 75 percent of all feature
films, said fast, effective medical care means fewer production
delays, reduced risk of lawsuits and lower insurance rates.
   ``It's a good situation for the actors, the crew and the
production company and it's good for the insurance company,''
Proimos said.
   Although his work appears to involve the glamour of Hollywood,
D'Orta says the LifeStar doctor is ``the one dose of reality in a
world of make-believe.''

<HEAD>Spain Cautiously Deciding Its Role in NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spain is cautiously feeling its way in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which it joined seven years ago.
   ``Most countries have been involved more years than us, so we
have to take things little by little,'' said Carlos Miranda,
director of international security affairs at the Foreign Ministry.
   Emerging from decades of political isolation under the
authoritarian regime of Gen. Francisco Franco, Spain is slowly
shaping the role that its defense forces will play in NATO.
   ``We are going to allow a great deal of flexibility ... for this
new player,'' said U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's top military
commander in Europe.
   Spain formally joined NATO on May 30, 1982, rounding out the
roster to 16 nations linking the United States and Canada to
Western Europe.
   Four years later, the socialist government of Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez put its membership to a popular vote, the first
NATO member ever to do so. A little more than 50 percent of the
voters agreed the nation should remain in the alliance _ but with
strings attached.
   Spain, they decided, would not be part of the integrated
military structure, nuclear weapons must not be stored on its soil,
and the U.S. military presence in Spain must be reduced.
   ``We are NATO with some special limitations,'' said Gen. Angel
Lobo, deputy director for international affairs in the Defense
Ministry's policy office.
   No Spanish troops are under NATO's command. The only other
country with forces outside the military structure is France, which
pulled out in 1966. Iceland, which also is a member, has no armed
forces.
   Unlike France, Spain takes part in key defense and nuclear
strategy sessions held regularly by the alliance. France has its
own nuclear force.
   Even with conditions attached, Western officials were relieved
that Spain continued to cast its lot with the alliance.
   Spain's membership, they say, strengthens the West's abilities
to deter any threat from the East.
   Lying between Portugal and France, Spain gives the alliance
extra depth in Europe.
   It offers important coastal access, particularly the strategic
Strait of Gibraltar, which links the Atlantic Ocean and the
Mediterranean Sea.
   Spanish defense officials have been holding a series of
discussions with NATO commanders to decide just how Spain will
coordinate its defense forces with those of the alliance.
   ``We have to invent sometimes formulas to suit the fact that we
are not integrated,'' said Miranda of the Foreign Ministry. ``But
we want to be efficient in coordination. ... ``We have to study the
way to do it. Sometimes it takes time.''
   The first two of six ``coordination agreements'' are expected to
be completed by year's end. The initial accords center on the air
defense of Spanish territory and air and naval operations in the
eastern Atlantic.
   Next on the list for discussion are the defense of Spanish
territory and naval and air operations in the western Mediterranean.
   Officials are putting off until last the most difficult areas _
controlling the Strait of Gibraltar and using Spanish territory for
transit, support and rear-guard logistics.
   Spain does not recognize NATO's command of Gibraltar, a British
colony. Spain claims sovereignty over the territory, a demand
rejected by the British government and seen as an obstacle to full
participation in NATO's military structure.
   Spain has been more successful in demanding a reduction of U.S.
troops on its soil.
   The U.S. and Spanish governments recently worked out an
agreement to withdraw a highly visible U.S. Air Force fighter wing
from the Torrejon Air Base on the outskirts of Madrid. The 72 F-16s
will be transferred over the next three years to southern Italy.
   The Spanish insistence on the unit's removal prompted complaints
that the Gonzalez government was not shouldering its share of the
Western defense burden. The fighter wing, a crucial part of the
U.S. striking power in Europe, is assigned to the defense of NATO's
southern flank along the Mediterranean.
   But even under the new agreement, about 8,000 American troops
will continue to be stationed in Spain, many of them at the huge
Rota naval base on the Atlantic.
   A NATO report released in December said about 70 percent of the
air-to-ground weapons training of the U.S. Air Force is conducted
in Spain, along with about 50 percent of the air-to-air weapons
training.
   Moreover, the report noted that Spain has increased its military
expenditures.
   On average over the last decade, it said, Spain was one of eight
countries that generally reached the NATO goal of increasing yearly
defense spending by 3 percent.
   Still, it said, the percentage of Spain's gross domestic product
_ the total value of goods and services _ earmarked for defense was
``well below'' the NATO median. The expenditures amounted to 2.4
percent of GDP in 1987, slipping to 2.2 percent last year.

<TEXT>
   The tiny Channel islands of Jersey and
Guernsey have become prospering offshore financial centers but some
natives are concerned their idyllic way of life may be lost in too
much wealth.
   ``The fear in all our minds is that we will become another Monte
Carlo,'' says Anne Perchard, a Jersey dairy farmer.
   With booming financial services industries and low taxes
attracting both job-seekers and the wealthy, the islands have
introduced rules to drastically cut immigration.
   Jersey now allows just five new millionaires to take residence
in the tax haven each year, down from 15, and it has what it claims
are the world's only price controls on homes.
   The islands' growing number of high-quality financial
institutions provide a place for individuals and companies to
legally shelter their money from their own countries' taxes and to
make more money on high-yielding investments.
   Income and corporate tax rates are 20 percent, and there are no
sales, inheritance or capital gains taxes.
   Attractions are the English language, political stability, the
British time zone, proximity to the Continent and freedom from
European Economic Community regulations.
   But the islands generally follow British financial regulations,
and an absence of bank secrecy acts has helped them avoid the
unsavory reputations of other tax havens.
   The result has been a job-creating economic boom that has
brought the big benefits of full employment and government budget
surpluses. But the downside has been immigration pressures,
high-rise buildings, traffic jams and strained water supplies.
   Natives who aren't sure they like this transformation clash with
the newcomers who want credit for improving the islands' living
standards.
   ``Jersey has to manage the success so you actually don't kill
the golden goose,'' said Jerseyman Martin Dryden, who is managing
director of Gartmore Fund Managers International Ltd.
   Jersey, which has an area of 39 square miles, has seen its
population swell to 82,000 from 60,000 in 1961. The population of
25-square-mile Guernsey has jumped to 60,000 from 54,000 in 1976.
   Many residents have one car and some have two, which works out
to about 100,000 automobiles on the islands.
   There are hopes _ and fears _ of more prosperity.
   The islands, which are dependencies of the British crown but not
members of the European Economic Community, are positioned to turn
into ``offshore Europe'' from ``offshore Britain'' when the
12-nation community becomes a single market in 1992.
   ``We see it as being a position of opportunity,'' says Colin
Powell, Jersey's leading civil servant.
   The Channel Islands, which also include the smaller, still rural
Alderney, Herm and Sark, are in the English Channel about 20 miles
off Normandy in France.
   Once part of the Duchy of Normandy, the islands retained their
allegiance to the king of England when Normandy was freed of
English rule in 1204.
   Although some patois and other French influences survive, most
people speak English. Gray, stone cottages have names such as
Hillsea View and gardening is taken seriously.
   Bailiffs appointed by Queen Elizabeth II preside over locally
elected legislatures. There are no political parties.
   During World War II, the Channel Islands were the only British
soil occupied by the Nazis _ for five long years.
   The islands' financial services industries began in the 1960s
and today, with hundreds of banks and insurance companies and more
than 1,000 investment funds, they dominate the islands' economies.
   Jersey says its finance sector overtook tourism in 1986 and
accounted for 40 percent of gross national product in 1987,
compared with 20 percent in 1975.
   The island's GNP doubled from 1962 to 1987, while Guernsey's has
grown an average 8.5 percent a year in the past three years.
   To stem the population growth, Jersey now requires companies to
obtain permission to increase staff and new companies need licenses.
   ``We are selective,'' Powell says. ``We would like to see
continued profit growth of the institutions without people growth.''
   Only people born on Jersey and their children are allowed to buy
and lease property. In Guernsey, 90 percent of the housing market
is reserved for locals.
   In Jersey, key professional workers can rent a home of their own
only after living in employer-provided accommodation for 10 years.
But that right expires next year. A right to buy a home after
living on the island for 20 years expires in the year 2000.
   Each year's five new millionaires have had to convince a housing
committee that they ``are of social and economic value to the
islands,'' says committee chairman Hendric Vandervliet.
   Seeking to protect young locals, the committee also reviews all
home sales and, if it thinks a price is too high, orders it
lowered. Prices would be 40 percent higher without these controls,
Vandervliet says.
   Real estate agents and other opponents say the controls
discourage sellers and make it more difficult for islanders to get
homes.
   ``All it's doing is closing the market up,'' says Sylvia Nixon,
a 44-year-old Jersey taxi driver, who after a two-year search
managed to find a property in bad condition for the equivalent of
$72,000.
   On both islands, natives worry that agriculture will die out.
   But Robert Lindell, general manager of Chase Manhattan Bank's
Jersey operations, says he is getting tired of the locals'
complaints.
   ``It's the financial industry that allows them to have a very
nice standard of living.''
   Says Norman Le Cheminant, Guernsey's top civil servant, ``Most
people would agree that the problems of prosperity are better than
not having prosperity.''

<HEAD>Instability in China Keeps Tourists From Hong Kong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tourism has fallen off sharply in Hong Kong
since the suppression of the students' pro-democracy movement in
neighboring China.
   Hong Kong's tourism boom came to an abrupt halt June 3-4 when
the Chinese army rolled into Beijing's Tiananmen Square and opened
fire on thousands of demonstrators.
   Legions of travelers, including many Americans, immediately
canceled trips to China that included stopovers in this British
colony, tourist industry officials said. Other visitors are staying
away from Hong Kong because of its proximity to China.
   The Hong Kong Tourist Association estimates that the number of
visitors to Hong Kong in June was 20 percent off from the same
month a year earlier and believes July's figures will turn out to
be similar when compiled.
   The decline has affected the $4.2-billion tourism industry from
the plush five-star hotels to the retailers who sell knick-knacks
at popular tourist haunts.
   One hotel executive said the current situation is good for
customers, because hotels have to be more guest-oriented.
   ``But for us it will be tough,'' he added.``We've been spoiled
in the past.''
   Internal figures kept by the hotel industry, based on 20 leading
hotels, indicate average occupancy plummeted to 75 percent in June
from 91 percent a year earlier. The South China Morning Post
newspaper said the rate in July was 64 percent.
   The news also is glum in the village of Stanley, a 30-minute bus
ride from downtown Hong Kong. It had become a tourist mecca because
of its narrow streets lined with stores selling discount clothes,
gaudy T-shirts and typical Hong Kong gewgaws, such as mechanical
toy pandas.
   The Stanley streets, often crowded with tourists, have become
uncommonly quiet even for the slow summer season, with some
retailers glumly seated outside stores empty of customers.
   ``The number of tourists has dropped since June 4, everybody
knows that,'' groused Ken Fu of the 2@3 Market in Stanley. In the
clothing shop's window was a sign advertising a ``Crazy Sale'' of
sweaters that had prices slashed by two-thirds after the Beijing
massacre.
   ``Because of the events in Beijing, we have had a great loss in
business,'' said a clerk at the Stanley Chinese Products Co.
   Ian Wade, chairman of the Retail Management Association of Hong
Kong, said sales in the colony were ``very depressed'' in June.
While he believes businesses are recovering, retail stores that
depend on tourism are probably still down 25 percent on average.
   Tourism, which accounts for roughly 10 percent of Hong Kong's
gross domestic product, had been on a long hot streak.
   Nearly 5.6 million visitors, primarily tourists, came to Hong
Kong last year, up 24 percent from 1987 and 154 percent from 1979,
according to tourist association statistics. About 2.4 million
visitors came to the colony in the first five months of this year,
a 15-percent increase from the same period in 1988.
   Most of those tourists came from Japan, where the rising yen
currency made Hong Kong prices cheap, and from Taiwan, where the
Nationalist Chinese government recently gave permission for its
citizens to visit China.
   Local hotels were delighted, maintaining occupancy rates at
levels of around 90 percent or higher. Generally, occupancy rates
of about 50 percent for established hotels and 65 percent for new
hotels are necessary to break even in Hong Kong.
   About three dozen more hotels are expected to open within the
next 30 months. A 91-story hotel with 2,400 rooms is scheduled to
open sometime after 1993.
   It is not clear whether all those new projects will remain
viable as existing hotels scramble to return to pre-June 4
occupancy levels. In one special promotion since the Beijing
crackdown, 37 hotels have offered six nights for the price of four.
   Meanwhile, the tourism association has been spreading the
message overseas that Hong Kong remains safe and is not part of
China. The organization also has increased invitations to foreign
journalists to visit the colony.
   But the key to recovery may well be the plight of China's own
tourism industry, which also came to a virtual halt after June 4
and has yet to recover. Recent statistics indicate that more than
one-fourth of visitors to Hong Kong were traveling to China.

   Today is Saturday, Aug. 26, the 238th day of 1989. There are 127
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Twenty-five years ago, on Aug. 26, 1964, President Lyndon B.
Johnson was nominated for a term of office in his own right at the
Democratic national convention in Atlantic City, N.J. Johnson
appeared before the delegates to announce he had chosen as his
running-mate Minnesota Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, who was also
nominated that night, by acclamation.
   On this date:
   In 55 B.C., Roman forces under Julius Caesar invaded Britain.
   In 1847, Liberia was proclaimed an independent republic.
   In 1873, radio electronics pioneer Dr. Lee DeForest was born in
Council Bluffs, Iowa.
   In 1883, the island volcano Krakatoa began erupting with
increasingly large explosions.
   In 1920, the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution,
guaranteeing American women the right to vote, was declared in
effect.
   In 1933, Helen Hull Jacobs captured the U.S. Lawn Tennis
Association singles title when Helen Wills Moody defaulted in the
third set because of back and hip pain.
   In 1939, the first televised major league baseball games were
shown on station W2XBS _ a double-header between the Cincinnati
Reds and the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field. (The Reds won the
first game, 5-2; the Dodgers won the second game, 6-1.)
   In 1957, the Soviet Union announced it had successfully tested
an intercontinental ballistic missile.
   In 1961, the official International Hockey Hall of Fame opened
in Toronto.
   In 1972, the Summer Olympics opened in Munich, West Germany.
   In 1974, Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly solo, non-stop
across the Atlantic, died at his home in Hawaii at the age of 72.
   In 1978, Cardinal Albino Luciani of Venice was elected the 264th
Pope of the Roman Catholic Church following the death of Paul VI.
The new pontiff took the name Pope John Paul I.
   In 1983, Soviet President Yuri V. Andropov offered to
``liquidate'' his country's medium-range missiles as part of a
superpower agreement on arms reductions.
   In 1987, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his country
would destroy its 72 Pershing I-A rockets if Washington and Moscow
were to scrap all their intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   Ten years ago: An Aeroflot jetliner remained parked at New
York's Kennedy International Airport for a third day, with U.S.
officials continuing to demand an interview with Soviet ballerina
Lyudmila Vlasova, whose husband, Alexander Godunov, had defected.
   Five years ago: Democratic vice-presidential nominee Geraldine
Ferraro celebrated her 49th birthday by noting it was also the 64th
anniversary of women's suffrage and urging women voters to make her
the nation's first female vice president.
   One year ago: Republican George Bush denounced Democrat Michael
Dukakis' criticism of Reagan administration's drug policies as ``an
insult,'' one day after the Massachusetts governor had said U.S.
dealings with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega were ``criminal.''
   Today's birthdays: Former Attorney General William French Smith
is 72. Washington Post executive editor Benjamin C. Bradlee is 68.
Author Ben J. Wattenberg is 56. Former Democratic vice-presidential
nominee Geraldine Ferraro is 54. Singer Valerie Simpson is 41.
   Thought for today: ``Spiritually a woman is better off if she
cannot be taken for granted.'' _ Germaine Greer, Australian

   Once, while Oliver North was riding high, a
spokesman for Ronald Reagan's White House issued a statement that
seemed to rule out U.S. talks with Lebanese hostage-takers. North
objected, saying that administration policy was to invite talks
while forbidding any concessions to terrorists.
   So the statement was amended.
   In that 1985 refinement, the Reagan administration said it had
offered to talk with anyone, including the kidnappers themselves,
but never had received a response.
   The distinction was a fine one, revolving around the question of
what would amount to negotiating with terrorists, as opposed to
talking with any and all parties about freeing the captives.
   To negotiate is to communicate with another party in an effort
to settle something. The word implies bargaining and compromise,
yielding one thing to get another. President Bush says he will not
permit that. Reagan said so publicly, even while his administration
was secretly breaching its own rule in the Iran arms-for-hostages
deal.
   As Bush seeks to open lines of discussion for the release of the
eight Americans held captive in Lebanon he has drawn the line
against the kind of negotiation that would amount to ransom for
hostages. ``I'm not going to do anything that would put some other
American, perhaps in some other place at some other time, at
risk,'' Bush said last week. ``And that means trading off or
negotiating for hostages.''
   Put another way, Bush said he would ``do nothing that will be
seen as quid pro quo for hostages.''
   The president said there was no subtle change in policy behind
his statements. The record bears him out. His position in the
current situation matches the avowed policy of the Reagan years,
when the Beirut hostage ordeal began. As vice president, Bush
headed a task force on terrorism which declared in its 1986 report
that there should be no negotiations for deals with terrorists.
   But there has been a change in tone in the heightened tension
over hostages since Israel seized a Shiite cleric in southern
Lebanon on July 28. Bush said he is looking for contact through
every possible channel.
   ``I'm not talking about terms, I'm talking about talking to get
people out that are held against their will,'' he said. ``And I
think I covered that pretty well in my inaugural address when I
said good will begets good will.''
   That message was directed to Iran, which holds some measure of
control over the Shiite Moslem factions holding the Beirut
hostages. Tehran is said to have offered help on the hostages in
exchange for the release of Iranian assets held by the United
States.
   The administration is willing only to suggest that good things
could happen if the atmosphere between the two nations were to
improve after a decade-long freeze _ and that nothing would do more
to improve it than release of the hostages. Longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   In a way, that does involve negotiations, guarded and indirect,
toward a long-term thaw that would bring freedom for the hostages
and later, presumably, would include the release of Iranian assets
impounded by the United States in the embassy hostage crisis a
decade ago.
   That won't be a simple process; U.S. and Iranian estimates of
the sums involved are billions of dollars apart, and an
international tribunal in The Hague is settling asset disputes.
Some $3.9 billion in Iranian assets were returned after the embassy
hostages were released in 1981.
   There's at least a chance that pattern could recur, and the
administration knows that if it did, there would be suggestions
that the whole deal had been cut in advance. But the White House
says it won't be done that way.
   ``We are not willing to link the Iranian assets questions to the
hostage question,'' Fitzwater said. ``...That fits within the
definition of our policy of not trading arms or money or whatever
for hostages and of not paying ransom for hostages.''
   He said that applies even though the assets were frozen in the
first place because Americans had been taken hostage.
   Then the other, conciliatory half of the message: the
administration is open to improved relations with Iran, and ``there
are benefits associated with having better relations with the
United States.''
   ``But we wouldn't speculate on any specific one,'' Fitzwater
said.

   Old Marshall Ferdinand Foch, who led the allies to victory in
World War I, said at the end of that conflict, ``This is not peace.
It is an armistice for 20 years.'' He was right, almost to the day.
   Nearly two decades later, after years of threat and bluster, of
depression and inequality, of fears and lies, on Sept. 1, 1939, 50
years ago on Friday, push finally came to shove. The first shots
were fired in World War II.
   No one could say the world did not have sufficient notice.
   For instance, on the last day of January 1939 at the White House,
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had called in the Senate
Military Affairs Committee to confide his fearful appraisal of the
world. His countrymen, many of them, suffered from a bad case of
isolationism. Yet he told the senators:
   ``About three years ago we got pretty definite information that
there was in the making a policy of world domination between
Germany, Italy and Japan...There are two ways of looking at it. The
first...is the hope that somebody will assassinate Hitler from
within; that somebody will kill Mussolini or he will get a bad cold
in the morning and die...The other attitude is that we must try to
prevent the domination of the world.''
   He had drawn the line. Adolf Hitler, whom he called a ``wild
man'' and ``a nut,'' was the enemy, whether the nation knew it or
not. Peace was slipping through the trembling fingers of Europe.
   Hitler had a timetable, had since he powered his way to control
of the German government on March 5, 1933, in Germany's last free
elections, a day after Roosevelt was inaugurated as president of the
United States.
   Hitler had taken a broken Germany, re-armed it in secret, bluffed
his way into the Rhineland which Germany had given up after World
War I. He buttressed the fascist dictator Francisco Franco in Spain
and conspired with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to divide
Europe. He bullied his way into Austria and Czechoslovakia and so
intimidated Britain and France that they welcomed the Munich pact
which British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain considered a
guarantee of ``peace in our time.'' It only convinced Hitler that
the old World War I allies were willing to pay for peace at any
price.
   Hitler had already put Poland on the plate; he needed it not only
for a breadbasket but as a source of labor. He would have Poland
even if it drew Britain and France into war. He was not, however,
ready to fight a war on two fronts.
   So he sought Joseph Stalin's assistance in the East, one of the
most bizarre alliances in modern history, the communist and the
fascist, philosophy be damned.
   The allies had dillydallied over a pact with Stalin to outflank
Hitler. They obviously did not savor doing business with the Soviet
leader. Hitler had no such compunctions. On Aug. 20, 1939, he agreed
to a Soviet-drafted non-aggression pact. In return, the Soviets
would get a free hand in the Eastern Baltic and a share of Poland.
   Hitler then put the Polish question on automatic. If the West
went to war, Italy promised to rattle sabers in the South to occupy
some French troops without actually joining the battle.
   Suddenly, on Aug, 31, the Polish ambassador's lines from Berlin
to Warsaw were cut. That night Hitler broadcast to his people peace
proposals to Poland which the Poles never heard, his usual ploy for
preparing the German mind for war.
   Finally he launched Operation Canned Goods, planned months
before. SS troops in Polish uniforms staged a mock attack on a
German radio station at Gleiwitz on the Polish border, leaving a
drugged concentration camp inmate, smeared with blood, as a German
``casualty'' of the attack. There were other such ``provocations''
along the border.
   Berlin was calmly asleep, but all communications to the outside
world were cut. Berliners would awaken to a war that would
eventually destroy them and much of Europe as well.
   At 5:20 a.m., Sept. 1, smack on Hitler's timetable, a German
warplane attacked the Polish fishing village of Puck and an adjacent
air base on the Gulf of Danzig. Twenty-five minutes later a shell
from the World War I battleship Schleswig Holstein made a direct hit
on a Polish ammunition dump at Westerplatte. At first light the
Wehrmacht began a motorized march toward Warsaw, and a new word,
``blitzkrieg,'' lightning war, was introduced into the military
lexicon.
   At 2:20 a.m., Washington time, four hours after the attack began,
the phone at President Roosevelt's bedside rang. It was his
ambassador in Paris, Bill Bullitt.
   ``Tony Biddle has just got through from Warsaw, Mr. President.
Several German divisions are deep in Polish territory and fighting
is heavy. Tony said there were reports of bombers over the city.
Then he was cut off...''
   ``Well, Bill, it's come at last. God help us all.''
   In London, mobilization was ordered. On Sept. 3, Britain went to
war. Winston Churchill, who had warned persistently of the German
threat, was made a part of an expanded war cabinet and first lord of
the admiralty, where he had served previously. Before he got there,
the word went out to the fleet, ``Winston is back.''
   In Berlin, Hitler received the news of Britain's declaration with
an immobile stare, but Hermann Goering, the head of the Luftwaffe,
said, ``If we lose this war, then God have mercy on us.''

   Hitler donned a military uniform and pledged to his people he
would not return to civilian clothes until the war was won, a
promise he kept to his death.
   The French played for time, adding a few insignificant hours to
their mobilization, before declaring war.
   There were those who thought the Poles could hold out for a
couple of months. Even the Germans thought in terms of weeks. But
German power had not been tested yet. It became a war of horse-drawn
artillery against motorized guns that could cover bad roads at 40
miles an hour, a war of lances against tanks.
   The Polish Air Force was destroyed in 48 hours by German bombers.
Stukas punctuated the sky, dive-bombing Polish troops who quickly
learned to lay low until the planes came out of their dives and fire
at them as they struggled for altitude.
   Cracow, Poland's second city, fell on Sept. 6. That same night
the Polish government fled the capital. Within one week Poland's 35
divisions had been either surrounded or destroyed by the fast-moving
Germans. It was all over in 17 days.
   The Germans tried to hurry the Soviets into the fray and to move
to pre-arranged borders as their part of the spoils _ and to take
some of the international blame. Wily Stalin, however, wanted the
Germans to agree to a statement that the Soviets had entered Poland
to spare White Russians from Nazi rule. The flabbergasted Germans
would not agree.
   So Stalin re-drew the occupation zones, giving up a small slice
of Poland for control of all the Balkan countries.
   Stalin got more than the German wanted to give him: Ukranian
wheat and Romanian oil and a buffer of countries against likely
German perfidy. Never mind that Hitler would take it all back in
June 1941, after he had conquered Europe. But for now it was a
secure border.
   The expected clash of the giants in the West didn't happen. The
French army, brought to the front by a divided government, sat
behind the Maginot Line, unwilling to force the issue.
   The first British troops could not be expected on the continent
until October. Besides, the conquest of Poland had been a
demonstration of incredible military force. Even Hitler was grateful
for the respite. Any incursion, any air raid, would require his
personal approval. The poised angels of destruction bided their time
behind the Siegfried Line.
   The stagnant war was called the sitzkrieg. The major
confrontation would be in abeyance until Hitler was good and ready,
in the spring of 1940.
   The German Navy, however, was given carte blanche. With the war
against Britain only 10 hours old, the British liner Athenia with
1,400 passengers was torpedoed without warning and sunk some 200
miles west of Scotland's Hebrides Islands. Of the 112 lost, 28 were
Americans.
   The Germans denied that their submarines had attacked (it was
later proved they had). They accused Churchill of putting a time
bomb aboard to influence British and international public opinion.
Nevertheless, in the first week of the war, the Germans sent 11
British ships to the bottom. For all of September U-boats claimed 26
ships sunk, and German mines took three more.
   Meanwhile, in the United States, Roosevelt sought to move his
nation out of its isolationist stance. He was, he said, ``almost
literally walking on eggs,'' so politically sensitive was the issue.
   At stake was the Neutrality Act. Finally, on Oct. 27, by a 63-30
vote, the Senate repealed the act with the House following. Arms
were now for sale on a cash-and-carry basis, and the first British
freighters began loading a week later.
   While all of this was going on, a curious and ominous letter
passed the president's desk, drafted by Leo Szilard, one of the many
displaced scientists who fled Hitler, and signed by another, Albert
Einstein. It told of advancements in atomic research, of potential
explosive devices of incredible power, each capable of destroying a
whole city.
   Roosevelt was slow to understand the cautious scientific
communication, but when an adviser pointed out that Napoleon once
had turned down Fulton's steamboat that might have carried his
troops to Britain, the president got the point.
   Roosevelt and Hitler were ironic characters of Shakespearean
proportions. Both rose to power a day apart in the depths of the
Depression. The world was out of work and out of hope. While
Berliners carted their nearly worthless Deutsche marks to market by
wheelbarrow, a third of America was unemployed, 400,000 rode the
rails. New York City had a million jobless, 82 breadlines and some
7,000 men and boys on the streets, shining shoes for pennies.
   Both leaders pulled their nations up out of despair by their
bootstraps, Hitler by edict, Roosevelt by innovative social
programs. They then led their peoples through a cataclysm such as
the world had never seen. And they would die within 18 days of each
other in April 1945.
   The failed German artist, who had lived in Viennese flophouses
and survived on charity soup, shot himself next to his poisoned
mistress-bride in a beseiged bunker. The patrician American with
withered legs was struck down by a massive stroke while waiting to
sit for his portrait, looking forward to the international
conference that would charter the United Nations.
   Within their political lifetimes, some 50 million people vanished
from the face of the earth in the violence of war, 20 million of
them in the Soviet Union alone. Of the 70 million men and women who
fought in the various armies, 17 million were killed.
   And the atomic bomb was born.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Few people have ever associated numbers with
sounds, but they play sweet music for Rajan Srinivasen Mahadevan.
His phenomenal recall of numbers has brought him fame and made him
the object of scientific curiosity, and left him a little wistful
about the blessings of ordinary life.

<TEXT>
   It's only fitting that Rajan's story begin
with a number: MYX1689, the number that started it all.
   MYX554 was the license plate on the second car that pulled up to
the house in Mangalore, India, where his parents were having a
party. MYX558 was the third.
   Some other 5-year-old might have sung a song or passed hors
d'oeuvres to show off to the grownups: Rajan Srinivasen Mahadevan
recited the license plates of all 40 cars in the order in which
they'd been parked.
   That was the first anyone knew of Rajan Mahadevan's astonishing
memory. Twenty-seven years later, millions know of it, and there are
days when he wishes he had sung a song or passed hors d'oeuvres.
   A memory that can hold fast to 31,811 random numbers yet
persistently misplace keys is a curious thing, a wondrous oddity
that can bring opportunity, fame _ perhaps even immortality _ to its
owner.
   But what of the other things a man has _ humor, creativity,
intellect? ``This damn thing overpowers everything else, to a
point,'' Rajan says.
   As a child, he says in the fluid, accented English he was raised
with, ``I used to be so lost in my own thoughts, I would talk to
myself. It was hard to fit in. Other kids didn't know what to make
of me.''
   Rajan's memory was not unexpected. ``It's like John Lennon's son
and music,'' he says. His father, a prominent surgeon, knows all
2,156 lines of William Shakespeare's 154 sonnets.
   ``I was expected to make it big in life. But my academic career
was like the drawing of a mountain range.''
   Rajan tried engineering and business administration, but felt no
affinity for either. Then someone suggested he put his memory to the
test, by trying to win a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
   He began studying a computer printout of the first 200,000 places
of pi, the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle.
The ultimate test of numerical memory, pi begins 3.14159, then
continues on indefinitely with no known duplication or pattern. Two
Columbia University mathematicians recently calculated pi to 480
million decimal places.
   On June 12, 1980, Rajan flew to Chicago, where he stunned the
fifth International Congress on Yoga and Meditation by reciting the
first 10,000 numbers.
   On July 5, 1981, he stood before a capacity crowd in a Mangalore
meeting hall and rattled off numbers so quickly the judges could
barely keep up. For three hours and 49 minutes, his memory never
faltered. Then, finally, a lapse: He forgot the 31,812th digit of pi
_ a 5.
   Never mind. The record _ 20,013 _ had toppled. ``On Feb. 16,
1983, I saw my name in the Book of Records, and I relaxed. That was
the argument stopper. Until then, people could say, `So you have a
good memory, so what?'
   ``But from 1981 to 1987, I was the best in the world.''
   In 1987, that honor went to Hideaki Tomoyori of Japan for
reciting 40,000 digits in 17 hours, 21 minutes.
   Still, memory expert Charles Thompson, a Kansas State University
psychology professor, is convinced Rajan's memory is superior. ``The
Japanese guy made up a story, a mnemonic, to help him remember the
numbers. His memory isn't as good.''
   In the lab where Thompson is studying Rajan's memory, numbers
flash past on a computer screen, one per second, and Rajan responds
as if to music. He taps his feet and rocks rhythmically back and
forth in his chair. Now and then he jiggles his legs.
   ``There's something about the way the numbers sound,'' he says.
``It's not the way they look, it's the way they sound.''
   For example, Rajan finds the numbers in pi from the 2,901th to
3,000th places _ 81911979399520614196 and so on _ particularly
melodic. The series between 3,701 to 3,800 _ beginning 2332609729 _
is ``very jarring.''
   ``Just as you can't describe how you remember your phone number,
neither can Rajan describe the process by which he remembers pi,''
says Thompson, who has been trying since January to figure it out,
along with Jerome Frieman, an animal behaviorist, and Thaddeus
Cowan, a cognitive psychologist.
   ``The first time we tested him, we said, `Oh my God!''' Thompson
thinks Rajan may have the most remarkable numerical memory known to
science since ``S,'' a patient immortalized in clinical literature
by A.R. Luria, the Soviet psychologist who studied him for nearly 30
years.
   ``S'' was S.V. Shereshevskii, a Soviet newspaper reporter whose
memory was discovered during the mid-1920s by an editor infuriated
by his failure to take notes. ``S'' didn't need to; he recalled
everything he'd ever seen or heard.
   What he couldn't do was forget. Ultimately, unable to distinguish
between conversations he'd heard five minutes or five years before,
``S'' wound up in an asylum.
   Rajan's memory is exceptional only for numbers. In all other
areas _ names, faces, words _ it is average. And unlike ``S,'' he
can forget, although ``it is hard to willfully forget numbers.''
Random numbers memorized one session come flooding back during
another. Keeping the sequences straight requires discipline and
concentration.

   These are tedious tests. This month's test records ability to
recall random digits that appear one per second on the screen. Ten
is extraordinary; most people remember about seven. Rajan has
recalled 64.
   His is not a photographic memory but a highly structured system
of some sort, Thompson says. ``Rajan has pi stored in a very
systematic way in his brain.''
   As photocopied from a textbook, the numbers are organized in
blocks of a thousand, with five blocks to a page. ``We'll say, `Give
us the 18,336th digit of pi.''' The time it takes Rajan to search
his memory for the right thousand block, then the right hundred, and
finally, to pinpoint the number, hints at how these storage and
retrieval processes work.
   So does the occasional error. ``If he makes a mistake, without
fail he'll be in exactly the right spot but a thousand digits off.
Or, he'll be in the right spot, only 10,000 digits off.'' Right
position. Wrong page.
   A three-year National Institutes of Health grant pays for the
research and for Rajan's work toward a master's degree in
physiological psychology. ``I want to know what neurons, what
neurochemicals, are responsible for memory.''
   The entire project ``could be interesting and fun and yet not
tell us a thing,'' Thompson says. ``What we hope is that we're
luckier than that. We hope his memory serves as a magnifying glass
to show us how ordinary memory works. That will depend if we're
clever enough and lucky enough to do the right tests. There are a
jillion tests.''
   As random numbers rush past, Rajan sometimes makes fleeting
associations with formulas learned in physics, chemistry or math,
with distances between cities, with zip codes or historic dates. Now
and then, he chuckles softly at some private numerical joke. As the
computer spits out 1,8,6,5, he murmurs ``Lincoln,'' who was
assassinated that year.
   Such connections don't help him remember, he says. They're merely
random thoughts that flit through his mind, small points of interest
along the infinite journey through the decimal expansion of pi.
   With testing over for another day, Rajan would much rather
discuss something else _ his talent for languages, artwork or
cooking. A man is more than his memory, no matter how good it is.
   ``Thirty years from now, I want to see myself as well-rounded. I
want to learn more languages, to learn musical instruments, to
become as accomplished as possible. One way to grow as a human being
is to develop your potential and expand mentally, then to help
others develop as well.''
   After 67 interviews in 56 days, he is tired of performing, tired
of being asked if he could memorize a phone book like Dustin Hoffman
in ``Rain Man,'' tired of explaining he's not an idiot savant.
   Rajan's growing celebrity is evident as he lopes along the wooded
paths of the campus, a solitary figure deep in thought, reed-thin
with dark eyes darting restlessly beneath inky curls. He shrugs off
his reverie and responds jovially each time a student approaches to
comment on this TV appearance or that magazine article.
   He chose Kansas State for its psychology department as well as
its generous financial aid, never imagining how lonely _ how
incongruous _ he might feel in a small town in Kansas, no matter how
friendly the town.
   ``There are far fewer distractions at KSU than at a UCLA or a
Columbia,'' he says philosophically. But he never misses a chance to
travel to bigger cities, and the distances are among the numbers
locked in his memory: 1,361 miles to New York, 1,294 to Washington;
498 to Dallas; 114 to Kansas City.
   There are other international students at KSU, but most are men,
and it isn't male company he longs for as he trudges back and forth
between the campus and his bachelor apartment. He shares it with
another Indian student, who's usually at his girlfriend's. ``I'm an
incredibly lonely guy,'' Rajan says.
   It's hard to tell at Fast Eddy's, the pool hall, where he seems
to greet everyone. For 20 joyful minutes, he stretches gracefully
over a table in the corner. His lanky arms send balls crashing as
Dave Jenson watches approvingly.
   The regulars know all about Rajan's memory but ``we try not to
talk about it,'' says Jenson, the owner's son. ``We take things in
stride.''
   Later, Rajan finds refuge with best friend Ruth Ridder, who feels
a kinship based on her own British upbringing. Ruth, husband Tony
and 3-year-old Hannah are ``my American family,'' he says. He and
Ruth take turns cooking each other Indian meals in her kitchen,
where his memory is as irrelevant as a trick knee.
   ``He's funny, he's generous with his time and his finances. He's
also unreliable, forgetful and annoying in lots of ways...He forgets
our phone number constantly,'' Ruth says.
   ``When it comes to his memory, I'm in the what's-the-point
category. I worry for him. He has a million acquaintances but he's
lonely. Too many people try to make him a performing animal. We try
not to talk about it.''
   In spite of himself, Rajan sometimes uses his memory to draw
people to him. Once, he got a woman at the cafe to give him 57
random numbers.
   ``He drank two cappuccinos, read Interview magazine from cover to
cover, and discussed the ill way we treat Nicaragua,'' Tony Ridder
recalls. ``Then he repeated them to her. Backwards.''
   Rajan admits to having hustled the occasional beer _ a beer he'd
barely touch _ but says that's all in the past. These days he
confines his wizardry to the lab ``so as not to contaminate the
research.''
   Besides, ``Nobody will touch me with a barge pole.''
   Tonight it's his turn to cook, and he arrives at Ruth's laden
with spices from the international market. He chases everyone into
the living room, strips off his shirt and spends the next hour alone
in the kitchen, shrouded in steam.
   ``I close my eyes and I'm back at my mother's table eating
supper,'' he says, lost in a memory not of numbers but of how it
feels to belong.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The governor of Puerto Rico calls it a
``historical first.'' If Congress approves the proposal _ it already
has the backing of President Bush _ residents of the Caribbean
island will be given a chance to vote on whether to become a state,
break away entirely from U.S. control or continue the commonwealth
form of government. It would be a first because the outcome of the
vote would be binding.

   Puerto Rico and the U.S. Senate are
preparing for the first vote in more than 20 years on whether this
tropical island of 3.3 million Spanish-speaking people will become
the 51st state.
   A plebiscite planned for 1991 would allow Puerto Rico to decide
whether to remain a U.S. commonwealth, break away to form an
independent nation or become the first state admitted to the Union
since Alaska and Hawaii in 1959.
   Under a bill approved by a Senate committee on Aug. 3, the
plebiscite would be self-executing; that is, the U.S. government for
the first time would agree in advance to accept whatever status
Puerto Ricans choose.
   ``It's never been tackled this way before,'' Gov. Rafael
Hernandez Colon said in an interview. ``It's a historical first.''
   President Bush endorsed the plebiscite proposal in his State of
the Union message in February and said he backed statehood for
Puerto Rico. However, the bill received committee approval by a
narrow vote _ 11-7 _ indicating it could run into trouble in the
full Senate and House of Representatives.
   Of the three options, only independence appears to have no
realistic chance of winning. But the plebiscite proposal has
rekindled anti-colonial sentiment. The biggest pro-independence
rally in recent history and a series of minor bombings coincided
with Senate hearings in San Juan in June.
   Hernandez Colon, who advocates continuation of the 37-year
commonwealth arrangement, but with more autonomy, proposed the
plebiscite in his inaugural address in January at the start of his
second consecutive four-year term.
   He says a referendum, the first since 1967, is needed to settle
the deeply divisive status issue, which has dominated Puerto Rico's
political debate virtually since Spain ceded the Caribbean island to
the United States in 1898 at the end of the Spanish-American War.
   As the home of Roosevelt Roads Naval Base, one of the world's
largest, Puerto Rico is strategically important. But successive
administrations have said Puerto Ricans should have the right to
determine their own fate.
   ``This issue goes to the very heart of our system of government,
to the principles of self-determination and of government by the
consent of the governed,'' Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman
of the Senate's Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said in
introducing enabling legislation.
   If Puerto Rico became a state, it would be by far the poorest and
the only one with Spanish as its main language. With its Spanish
heritage, customs, literature, salsa and merengue music and its
location in the Caribbean, it would also be a state with a
distinctly Latin American flavor.
   But after nearly 100 years of U.S. dominance and with more than 2
million Puerto Ricans living in the States, the island is
unmistakably American. U.S. post offices, the dollar, shopping
malls, and 31 Burger Kings in the San Juan metropolitan area alone
are just a few of the reminders.
   ``We're Latin Americans perhaps in our music, in our language,
but we're Americans in many ways in our daily lives,'' says Carlos
Romero Barcelo, a former governor and leader of the statehood party.
``In our attitudes, in our political heritage, we're definitely
American.''
   Yet, Puerto Ricans retain a strong sense of national identity.
Politicians invariably refer to Puerto Rico as a ``pais,'' or
country, and the people take pride in having their own Olympic team
and Miss Universe contestant.
   Under the commonwealth, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and are
eligible for military service, food stamps and most other benefits
available to other Americans. However, they pay no federal taxes and
cannot vote for president.
   Although Puerto Rico is self-governing, it has no control over
immigration, international trade or defense. The island sends no
senators or congressmen to Washington, only a non-voting resident
commissioner.

   Statehood and independence supporters say commonwealth is only
another name for colonialism.
   ``We are a territory by U.S. constitutional terms, and a colony
by international terms,'' Romero says. It is a status, he says, that
makes Puerto Ricans second-class citizens, with no vote and no
control over their destiny.
   The United States, he asserts, ``is one of the few colonial
powers left in the world _ that is a smear on the nation's face.''
   Commonwealth supporters contend that the status quo is the only
arrangement that allows Puerto Ricans to retain their cultural
identity while reaping the benefits of U.S. largesse.
   The federal government spent $6.5 billion on Puerto Rico last
year, and an estimated 60 percent of Puerto Rican families receive
money under the food-stamp program. The economy is further
underpinned by tax exemptions granted to U.S. subsidiaries, which
provide $10 billion in local deposits and an estimated 30,000 direct
and indirect jobs.
   ``The one thing that works politically is the fear that they may
lose some of these benefits,'' says A.W. Maldonado, a prominent
commonwealth supporter and newspaper columnist.
   The independence party has always maintained that the United
States has no right under international law to occupy Puerto Rico.
The party's leader, Ruben Berrios Martinez, has proposed a
transition period during which U.S. programs would be phased out to
avoid economic disruption.
   Berrios contends that Congress won't accept Puerto Rico as a
state because to do so would immediately boost the political clout
of Hispanics.
   ``Puerto Rico would be a representative of Latin America in the
Congress,'' he said in a recent interview with the pro-statehood El
Nuevo Dia.
   Earlier this century, the independence movement was a powerful
force, but support waned as the commonwealth took hold. There are
still extremists who advocate the violent overthrow of U.S. control,
but they have been less active in recent years.
   Some critics of statehood have suggested that it could result in
a situation similiar to Northern Ireland, with a militant element
perpetually trying to force separation.
   Since 1968, the commonwealth and statehood parties have held the
governor's mansion with almost equal frequency, and elections
usually result in near-dead heats. It is unclear, however, whether
either party could muster a 50-percent-plus majority in a status
plebiscite.
   In the 1967 plebiscite, 60 percent of the people voted to
continue the commonwealth relationship, 39 percent for statehood and
1 percent for independence. That vote was not binding on Congress
and the statehood and independence parties did not actively campaign.
   A poll published in February by El Nuevo Dia indicated that
commonwealth status is less popular than it was 20 years ago, but
remains the favored choice.
   The poll, carried out by the Yankelovich organization before Bush
publicly backed statehood, found 45 percent for commonwealth, 35
percent for statehood and 5 percent for independence, with the
remainder undecided. The survey of 500 voters had a statistical
margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.
   To bolster support for the status quo, Hernandez Colon has
proposed what he calls ``enhanced commonwealth'' in which Puerto
Rico could reject any federal laws deemed unfair to the island.
   The governor also has asked that Puerto Rico be given economic
jurisdiction over its territorial waters, authority to issue U.S.
passports and the right to negotiate international trade agreements.
He has acknowledged that Congress is unlikely to grant all the
concessions.
   Plans call for congressional passage of a plebiscite bill by the
end of 1990, so that the vote can be taken in 1991 before local and
national elections the following year. The plebiscite is tentatively
set for June 4, 1991.

   The grand old man of Puerto Rico's
statehood movement is Luis A. Ferre, a millionaire philanthropist
and former governor.
   At 85, the venerated ``Don Luis'' is still going strong,
overseeing his charitable foundation and chasing an ideal that has
eluded him over a political career spanning nearly half a century:
U.S. statehood for Puerto Rico.
   ``I knew that this was going to take time,'' he said in an
interview a few days before flying to Washington for Senate hearings
on Puerto Rico's future relationship with the United States. ``It
was a question of waiting for the thing to evolve to the proper
time.''
   Ferre says that time has finally come, and predicts a referendum
planned for 1991 will see a 60-percent majority in favor of
abandoning Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. commonwealth and making
the Caribbean island the 51st state.
   Ferre has played a prominent role in Puerto Rican politics since
World War II. He was a member of the assembly that produced the 1952
constitution, founded the pro-statehood New Progressive Party in
1967 and was governor from 1969 to 1972. Today, he is chairman of
the island's Republican Party.
   Yet, his most enduring work may be his philanthropy, and in
particular the Ponce Museum of Art, which London's Financial Times
called ``one of the most distinguished private collections in the
Western Hemisphere outside the United States.''
   Ferre opened the museum in Ponce, his birthplace in southern
Puerto Rico, in 1959 with 120 of his own paintings. Today, it houses
500 paintings, including several noted pre-Raphaelites, along with
hundreds of sculptures and artifacts, with a total estimated value
of $50 million.
   Ferre's grandfather was a French engineer who worked on the
Panama Canal before settling in Cuba. His father, Antonio, moved to
Puerto Rico as a young man and married Maria Aguayo Casals, a cousin
of the Spanish cellist Pablo Casals, who lived in Puerto Rico.
   Ferre studied engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where he was captain of the fencing team.
   He also trained at the New England Conservatory of Music. He is
an accomplished classical pianist, occasionally performing in
public, and still tries to put in a few hours of practice every day.
   It was during his university days, Ferre said, that he developed
a passion for the ``American way of democracy'' and eventual
statehood for Puerto Rico.
   On his return to the island, Ferre got a job as an engineer at
the Puerto Rico Iron Works. Later, he and a brother, Joseph, founded
the Puerto Rico Cement Co. in Ponce, the source of the family's
wealth.
   In his first philanthropic venture, Ferre founded the Ponce
Public Library in 1937. At about the same time, he bought the city's
newspaper, El Dia, which was in danger of folding. ``My theory was
that a city without a newspaper is a city without a soul,'' he says.
   When he became governor, Ferre sold the newspaper to his son,
Antonio, who moved it to San Juan. It is now the pro-statehood El
Nuevo Dia, one of the biggest of Puerto Rico's four dailies.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Vince Lane remembers a gentler time when
Chicago's public housing projects actually were nice places to live.
As chairman of the city's housing authority, he envisions again
having well-kept playgrounds and gardens and organized activities in
the projects. But first he has had to deal with crime, and in some
unorthodox ways.

   The tough-talking new boss of the Chicago Housing
Authority is determined to drive gang members and drug dealers out
of the projects even if it means stepping on the toes of some of the
tenants and upsetting some civil libertarians.
   ``It's like squeezing an orange, a door-to-door squeeze,'' says
Vince Lane, who last year took over as chairman of the CHA, whose 18
complexes are home to 150,000 people.
   ``I want them out. I want to keep them out.''
   His tactics have included unannounced police sweeps of the
projects and searches of many apartments, prompting a lawsuit by the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   Lane's efforts may rankle some tenants, but they yielded a
13-percent drop in the crime rate over the final seven months of
1988.
   Lane, 47, has a master's degree in business administration from
the University of Chicago. He drinks herbal tea for lunch and reads
Lee Iacocca books in his spare time.
   A divorced former developer and entrepreneur, Lane is accustomed
to getting his way and considers himself anything but a civil
servant. His supporters call that an asset. His critics call it a
detriment.
   ``I think some of the things he's done have been questionable
legally, but they've been understandable _ in dealing with the
social decay, the frustration of tenants,'' says Gary Orfield,
professor of public policy at the University of Chicago. ``It's a
lot better than doing nothing.''
   For example, at Rockwell Gardens _ the most dangerous CHA
development where eight in 100 residents were reported robbed,
raped, assaulted or murdered in 1987 _ the crime rate dropped 32
percent.
   Ironically, Lane says, the over-all crime statistics rose as
people became less afraid to report crimes and as gangs, pushed out
of their territories by the sweeps, went to battle rivals for
control of remaining domains.
   Despite the improvements at Rockwell, living there is no picnic.
   ``It's kind of tough,'' says Antonio Woods, 14, as he and a group
of youngsters cruised the project grounds one afternoon. ``You don't
know what's going to happen. You don't know who comes up to you.''
   Woods lives in a Rockwell building recently sand-blasted to
remove graffiti and secured by door monitors who check the
identification cards of anyone entering the building. When Lane
visited the building recently, some residents shouted ``Stop the
lockdown'' as he passed by.
   ``It's like jail,'' Woods says, acknowledging his ambivalence
toward the arrangement.
   Random shootings on the playground have stopped, but life is
still far from perfect, say Woods and his friends. ``We need a new
playground with some basketball rims,'' he says.
   Lane would like to see that happen, with a plan that comes from
childhood memories. In the 1950s, he lived across the street from a
housing project on Chicago's South Side.
   ``They had neat, nice basketball courts, swimming pools, the
whole bit,'' he says. ``It was far preferable to where I lived.''
   Swimming pools might be pushing it, he says. But his realistic
programs call for grass instead of mud-caked lawns, flowers instead
of weeds and resident programs instead of gang activity. Much of
those programs is to come from resident-organized groups financially
independent of the housing authority.
   ``Right now, gangs are the only organized activity for young
people,'' he says. ``When residents are able to not worry about
staying alive, they will actively participate in any other activity
of a normal community.''
   Jack Kemp, secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, has called Lane's plans a model for the nation. But
praise is more forthcoming than money.
   ``He has a lot of ways and ideas that are not orthodox for public
housing, and those unorthodox methods get people's attention,'' says
Gertrude Jordan, regional director of HUD, which funds the major
share of CHA's $150 million annual budget.

   But Lane says he is frustrated by a lack of money and the
quagmire of bureaucracy he needs to wade through to get it. Although
he has managed to add $8 million to this year's budget, he estimates
it would take $740 million to bring CHA's buildings up to par.
   Ultimately, what happens in the CHA depends on what happens in
Washington, Orfield says.
   ``Jack Kemp wants to pretend housing problems can be solved by
good will and enthusiasm at the local level, but you need money to
solve the basic problems,'' he says. ``My feeling is that if Lane
doesn't get some support on a serious level from Washington, his
enthusiasm will detely covered by stacks
of sheet music, and by shelves bulging with music books.
   The office is in old Public School 68, at 127 W. 127th St., on a
floor rented by the choir. Turnbull spoke over a muted background of
major third chords, sung in unison. About 30 boys were warming up in
a nearby classroom, its windows covered by heavy wire mesh and
overlooking a row of tenements disfigured by graffiti, some boarded
up and abandoned.
   The towering, robust tenor and former public school teacher took
over later, praising and cajoling as he conducted a selection of
works including Bach's ``Christ Lag in Todesbanden'' in German. One
passage that sounded perfect to the casual listener raised his ire.
   ``That's unacceptable, what kind of reading is that?'' he
thundered, slamming a meaty hand down on his note stand. The kids _
some in their mid-teens, all clearly respectful _ did it again
without a murmur.
   Turnbull holds a doctorate in music and is proud of the Boys
Choir's international reputation of excellence. Besides German, the
ensemble sings in French, Italian, Hebrew and Latin as well as
English and has toured much of Europe. It has sung in St. Paul's in
London and St.-Germain-des-Pres in Paris and was off to Japan this
month.
   ``It's a very unique sound,'' Turnbull says, rejecting attempts
at comparison with well-known European boys' choirs. Unlike those,
the Harlem ensemble includes tenors and basses as well as the
traditional trebles.
   ``There are those purists who say there is only one way to sing
it, but in fact the Boys Choir of Harlem experience is the Boys
Choir of Harlem experience,'' he says. ``I don't think anybody could
sing spirituals like the Boys Choir. But even if the boys' choir of
Vienna was doing the Haydn `Te Deum,' there will be a difference in
over-all feeling from the way we'll do it.''
   Turnbull also places emphasis on the non-musical opportunities
for choir members.
   Tutoring, in subjects ranging from English and mathematics to
music theory, is provided six days a week, and some kids go to the
choir's own school. Choir members must maintain a B average.
   Three full-time counselors give year-round career, family and
adolescent counseling. During the summer, choir members attend day
camp in New York City and a live-away camp in the Connecticut
countryside.
   The choir has received international rave reviews, and Barbara
Bush, the president's wife, commented after a June 5 White House
performance that the choir's program of all-round care should be
duplicated around the world.
   But Turnbull and his aides have trouble funding even the one
operation.
   Despite some generous corporate donations, the program is
chronically short of money _ $300,000 was lacking in May from a
projected budget of $1.4 million, although the choir is fully booked
with paying performance dates.
   Turnbull says the staff does what it can, despite financial
difficulties and invoked the choir's slogan, ``Boys Choir of Harlem
Saves Lives.''
   Most of the children come from one-parent, low-income or welfare
families, and Turnbull said the counselors often have their hands
full.
   ``There are problems within the family, with siblings who might
be dealing or messing with drugs, or in some cases even parents,''
he says. ``Poverty is the main problem. It all boils down to poverty.
   ``Sometimes parental problems are so severe that they make it
difficult to come to rehearsals every day, and once they stop coming
every day they kind of fall.''
   The boys also have to fight peer pressure from outsiders.
   ``Many kids are ribbed,'' Turnbull says. ``But then, their
comeback is, `Have you ever been to Japan? Have you been to Europe?
Have you traveled to the Caribbean?'
   ``There are all kinds of things that kids in the Boys Choir of
Harlem get to do that most kids would never get the chance to do.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He doesn't do ducks. But when it comes to carving
just about any other kind of bird, Larry Barth is a recognized
master of a craft most often associated with producing decoys for
duck hunters. Barth's birds are considered true works of art.

   Larry Barth is a heavyweight in a world
where a gram of wood shavings fluttering onto his workbench can
represent a hard day's work.
   He carves birds.
   The sharp steel edges of Barth's chisels bite into blocks of
basswood and tupelo and find song birds, predators and game birds
that possess an air of movement. With that he is helping to
transform wildfowl carving into something more than a sportsmen's
craft.
   ``There's a tremendous interest in wildlife art and probably has
been for the past 10 or 15 years,'' says Sam Dyke, immediate past
president of the Ward Foundation, a non-profit arts and education
organization which sponsors an international competition in Ocean
City, Md. ``But it's certainly not the kind of art that endures.
It's maybe calendar art. It's not generally regarded as fine art.
Larry's work is.''
   Barth, 31, works in a quiet, well-lighted shop in his home among
hardwood forests and manicured farms in the Laurel Mountains, 50
miles east of Pittsburgh.
   He is usually at his bench from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m., breaking for
lunch and supper. He often returns to work when the hubbub of
evenings with his wife, Linda, and their two young children
dissolves into night.
   ``For fun I go out and do brute force things that don't require a
lot of precision _ splitting firewood or building stone walls around
the place.
   ``That feels really good after a day of removing a gram of wood
from feathers the size of your fingernail.''
   Barth prefers to carve song birds, but is getting more mileage
out of birds of prey.
   ``I'm not into ducks,'' he says.
   Some people are. A decoy of a pintail carved by Elmer Crowell of
Massachusetts was auctioned several years ago for a record $319,000.
   That was probably an ``aberration'' in an emerging and unsettled
market, says Curtis Badger, editor of Wildfowl Art, the Ward
Foundation's quarterly magazine.
   The Ward Foundation purchases each year's winning entry for
$20,000, but antique decoys are where the big money is.
   ``You have to do what you know,'' Barth says. ``What I know about
are song birds, upland game birds and birds of prey.''
   Before lifting a knife or a chisel, Barth studies the bird he
plans to carve. He reads books, examines pictures and museum
exhibits and watches them in life, often at a bird-banding station
that Carnegie Museum operates a half- mile from his house.
   After the drawing comes the critical rendering in clay.
   ``Once I have the clay model done, as far as I'm concerned, the
piece is done,'' he says. ``The toughest decisions I make are in the
clay. After that it's just technical execution...the noodling out of
the detail.''
   Carving the wood can be grueling. Gluing blocks of wood together
and roughly shaping them with chisels is followed by the tedium of
carving the feathers, detailing each down to the space between the
barbs.
   ``I'm dealing with the top one-sixteenth of an inch of the
wood,'' he says.
   He chars the wood with an electrically heated blade to create the
distinct, hard feathers of the tail and wings, and he grinds the
wood to create the loose, soft feathers of the body.
   Barth established himself as a new force in the field with
back-to-back world class titles at Ocean City.
   He won in 1985 with a formidable and confident snowy owl, at
rest, smugly clutching a limp Bonaparte gull. Barth repeated the
next year with a pair of airborne terns, one flaring its tail and
wingtips, the other tucking a wing and arching its tail as the two
birds bank left in tight formation.
   Most recently, Barth received a commission from the prestigious
Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum in Wausau, Wis.
   The Woodson Museum, a general art museum with a specialty
collection of wildlife art, is paying Barth an undisclosed sum for a
carving of his choice. Indulging his preference for robust, chunky
birds, Barth is carving a tern being chased by two jaegers, the
black-hooded bullies of the seashore.
   ``He's showing situations that seem almost impossible to present,
given the medium,'' says Kathy Foley, director of the Woodson
Museum. ``Larry is a maverick, a marvel, a master. He's carved
circles around people who've been carving longer than Larry's been
alive.''
   The Woodson commission is the latest in a series of honors Barth
has received since he jumped into the spotlight at age 21 with a
family of great horned owls that won second place at the 1979 Ward
competition.
   Until then, he had carved in isolation, making his own tools and
developing his own techniques after being drawn to the craft through
his father's interest in wood carving and his mother's interest in
bird watching.
   Barth was in the ninth grade when he carved his first bird, a
thumb-size attempt at a rufous-sided towhee. He still has the black,
brown and white carving.
   A series of birds emerged from a sugar pine plank from the
family's picnic table. Barth sold many of his early carvings to
florists and others to use as decorations.
   Cornell University accepted him to study ornithology, but Barth
realized at the last minute that he didn't care how a bird's liver
works, only what the bird looks like. He entered Carnegie Mellon
University to prepare for a career in illustration. Carving remained
his hobby.
   He later redefined his major to carving.

   Jeffrey Jones calls his first television
series, ``The People Next Door,'' a ``light, romantic comedy with a
subversive twist.''
   In the CBS show, Jones plays a successful cartoonist named Walter
Kellogg who has a new wife, two kids and a powerful imagination. The
latter figures heavily in the stories because everything he imagines
springs to life.
   ``I became a cartoonist because things in my imagination suggest
cartoons to me,'' Jones says. ``But it's not cartooncie Allen.
   So welcome Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney in their latest enterprise
as stars of off-Broadway's eminently successful ``The Kathy and Mo
Show: Parallel Lives.''
   They play teen-agers, retired women, angels in heaven, lonely
folks in a bar, sometimes even men.
   But they're not just after laughs.
   Mo says, ``We get letters from people who say the show made them
think. And it just makes some people happy. I'm not saying every
scene we do has a message.''
   Kathy says, ``Even our two alcoholics in the country bar, we see
the fun in them and the reality of them and think they're not too
different from us. That's a fun piece to do.''
   But there is meaning and respect here, too, as the humorous
mini-plays roll off their stereotypical subjects, for instance a
couple of unsophisticated older women going back to college.
   ``Discrimination, for sexes and races, as a whole has bothered me
forever and will continue to until it's gone,'' Mo says. ``This is
pretty much what we have to say.''
   Kathy adds, ``If we're feeling particularly concerned with
women's self-esteem or how women and men think they're supposed to
be and how we go about fulfilling that, that's going to pour out in
our work. Society is obsessed with telling women how they're
supposed to be, under the auspices of being more liberated. It is
just another set of rules. I think we waste a lot of time when we
could just be living.''
   When they're creating, Mo says, ``Scenes begin with a character
or an issue or a situation. It's easiest to build around characters,
I think. You know what they'd do and say and what situation they'd
be in.''
   A San Diego native whose parents are from Beirut, Kathy Najimy
studied acting and directing at San Diego State. ``I had no thought
of being in a duo,'' she says. ``I was in feminist theater, Sisters
on Stage, in college. I was a director in San Diego, was in tons of
musicals. I have an alto, belting voice. I got tired of that real
quick. I did a couple of serious plays.
   ``I directed teen-agers in a stage show that got brought to TV
and won two Emmys. I did a one-woman show, `It's My Party,' did a
bit of stand-up at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles. For five years,
I was always in something.''
   Then Kathy and Mo met in 1982 and wrote some skits for ``The
Kathy and Mo Show.'' After a planned evening performance for
friends, the show played the Old Town Theater in San Diego, then
Don't Tell Mama here. In 1986, ``The Further Adventures of Kathy and
Mo'' opened at the Second Stage Theater here, then toured. Kathy and
Mo added some skits and opened the present version at the Westside
Arts Theater on Jan. 31.
   ``Now we've got TV, film and book offers we're thinking about,''
Kathy says. ``We might move to Oregon and open a Laundromat.''
   And, sadly, they might go separate directions for awhile. Kathy
wants to direct and perform in other things. Mo has been writing a
screenplay and would like to write for and act in films.
   Mo Gaffney, named Maureen by her mother who thought Maureen
couldn't be nicknamed, at 18 received stationary from a friend
emblazoned ``Messages from Mo-face.'' Mo stuck.
   ``I was in a feminist improv group, Hot Flashes, for a long
time,'' she says. ``We played women's festivals. I'm like a grown-up
feminist now. I always wanted to be an actor. Writing came almost
from having to, so you don't always have to audition for somebody
else's play.
   ``I was a funny little kid. It was easy to be in my family. We
didn't sit around the piano and sing but we had great lines shooting
back and forth.''
   Kathy, who met her boyfriend, painter and pianist John Boswell
here, says, ``We're very different. Most of the time the difference
is wonderful. Sometimes it's a problem. I loved New York right away.
Mo didn't adjust to it too well and does not want to live here.''
   Mo says, ``I keep the books. Kathy talks to people, goes to
business meetings. I type the scripts and do the correspondence. I
like working on my word processor. She's more outgoing. I like
keeping things in order.
   ``The only thing we're the same on is writing. That's where we
merge best. One of us comes up with an initial idea. There'll be a
certain amount of discussion and rewriting. This show is almost
exactly 50-50 as far as writing is concerned.''
   Kathy says that the hardest scene to play is one in which three
sisters meet. ``I play two of them. They're normal women, our age,
our economic bracket. It's not like one has a Southern accent. They
can't be that different. It's really difficult to find subtle
differences of people much like myself.
   ``It is easier to find truth in the dramatic parts. Comedy is
truth plus timing plus facial expressions.''

   Twelve years ago Sunday, an unlovely
collection of human engineering named Voyager 2 broke free of the
Earth's gravity and started a long tour of the solar system.
   The spacecraft has cruised the rings of Saturn, observed
Jupiter's Great Red Spot, watched volcanos erupt on its moon Io and
discovered clandestine moons circling Neptune.
   And in that blink of cosmic time there have been changes for
Voyager's creators and handlers, those who built it and shepherded
it across space, marking its 4 billion-mile course in human
milestones.
   ``There's people who remember their children's birthdays in terms
of where the spacecraft was. We've had people get married and people
who died during the mission,'' said Charles Kohlhase, the mission
design manager for Voyager. ``There are going to be a lot of people
who have been loyal to this project who are going to be sad when its
over.''
   The sad day is coming. After a close encounter with Neptune this
week that promises another set of spectacular pictures from a
distant planet, Voyager 2 will continue on its way out of the solar
system at 37,000 miles an hour, becoming the man-made object that
has traveled the farthest from Mother Earth.
   Voyager 2 was launched on Aug. 20, 1977. Its sister ship, Voyager
1, launched Sept. 5, 1977, has been cruising through an empty part
of the solar system following a 1981 flyby of Saturn.
   Only a skeleton crew of technicians will monitor the Voyagers as
they continue to sniff deep space for information, looking for the
heliopause, the zone where the sun's influence on the solar system
ends.
   With enough plutonium to keep their electronics running another
28 years, the gangly 1,700-pound creations resembling failed Erector
sets will likely outlive the humans who built them and whose
signatures, and the names of their families, are etched on thin
sheets of titanium bolted into the spacecrafts' side.
   ``Everybody in my family feels connected to what's happened with
Voyager,'' said Ray Heacock, the deputy assistant director at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory who oversaw development of Voyager. ``I've
worked on a lot of other projects, but this is my baby.''
   And others' baby as well. Thousands of people in dozens of
companies and universities across the country helped design and
build the sturdy spacecrafts.
   ``It was tremendously exciting and satisfying to be involved in
the project,'' said James McAnally, who led the Denver-based Martin
Marietta's efforts to develop Voyager's guidance system and
planetary radio receiver.
   At JPL, there are constant reminders of Voyager. Hallways and
offices are adorned with its pictures from Jupiter and Saturn like
the artwork of a favorite child. The facility's closed-circuit
television system offers updates about the progress of the mission.
   Yet Voyager is a success story that almost wasn't.
   Originally envisioned as an ambitious and expensive ``grand
tour'' of the outer solar system by four spacecraft, the plan was
scrubbed in 1972 as the nation, sated with moon flights, turned its
attention away from the space program.
   Instead, NASA dropped the idea of visiting Uranus and Neptue with
a new spacecraft and built two souped up versions of the proven
Mariner design for a mission to only Jupiter and Saturn.
   But scientists hoped it still might be possible to send one of
the spacecraft on to Uranus and Neptune by using gravitational
fields of the giant planets to bend Voyager's trajectory like a
billiard ball in a cushion shot.
   When it became apparent Voyager 2 could make the Grand Tour,
scientists had to improvise with its aging technology. While the
spacecraft has 5 million electronic parts _ the equivalent of 2,000
color TV sets _ it has only a quarter the computing power of today's
personal computers.
   So Voyager 2's onboard computers were reprogrammed from across
space to compress its bursts of data. A new tracking system was
devised for its cameras to ensure clear, detailed pictures despite
the increasing transmission distance to Earth and the feebler light
at the end of the solar system.
   More tracking dishes were added in the deserts of California and
New Mexico and in Australia, Spain and Japan to capture Voyagers'
weak radio signals that have spread and diffused over the billions
of miles.
   ``We've done things with it that we haven't done with any other
system,'' said Heacock.
   This technological creativity would have gone wanting if the
spacecrafts' key equipment broke down. There have been what Heacock
calls ``cliffhangers'': one radio that received Earth communications
blew a fuse, another became deaf to some frequencies. Voyager 2's
computer lost some memory and a platform that scans the planets gets
stuck if it moves too fast.
   Yet everything else has continued to work, despite a dozen years
of the absolute heat and cold of space and bursts of radiation from
Jupiter 1,000 times the lethal dose for a human.
   Even though the Voyagers have ``total redundancy'' _ basically
two of everything _ the odds of making it this far were considered
slim.
   The scientists had data on the reliability of the spacecrafts'
components, and said Heacock, ``None of those numbers that we used
had us operating at this point.''
   Kohlhase credited the human factor. ``I hate to sound trite, but
the people involved with the design of the spacecraft were
motivated, talented, creative people,'' he said. ``The reliability
is the result of those creative energies.''
   Heacock and Kohlhase say they don't think of the Voyagers as
living beings. And yet, said Kohlhase, ``We all feel affection for
them.
   ``It's sort of like we're connected to these machines. They are
not human, but they are extensions of our human qualities.''
   Kohlhase bears a strong resemblance to Star Trek's Mr. Spock, and
has gone to costume parties dressed as the science fiction
character. Now 53, he was 39 when he began working on Voyager. In
the time of Voyager he survived major surgery for cancer of the
thyroid.
   ``I was able to schedule it between the two Saturn encounters,''
he said, laughing.
   Also in the time of Voyager he saw his two daughters grow from
teen-agers into lives of their own. He now has a grandson whose
picture shares a spot on the office wall with images from space.
   ``I look forward to the time when I'm an old man telling my
grandchildren my name is on a spacecraft escaping from the solar
system to travel in the core of the Milky Way,'' he said.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Casualties of War''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The national conscience about the Vietnam War is explored once
more in Brian DePalma's shocking new film, ``Casualties of War.''
Again, American soldiers are the villains of the piece, and the
tragedy is heightened by the realization that the events actually
happened.
   The film is based on 1969 reportage for New Yorker magazine by
Daniel Lang. He wrote about a detail of soldiers who were sent on a
routine reconnoitering mission. The veteran sergeant in command,
Meserve (all of the actual names were changed), decided they would
take along some ``portable r&amp;r.'' He led the group to a native
village, where they abducted a young woman.
   The soldiers and their captive established a camp at a native
hut, where they raped her. All participated, some with reluctance,
all except a Vietnam newcomer, Eriksson. He was appalled by what he
saw and tried unsuccessfully to help the girl escape.
   Meserve led the soldiers and the girl into combat and decided she
had to be killed to destroy any evidence. The deed was willingly
performed by the radio man, Clark. After a fierce battle, the detail
returned to camp, where Eriksson decided to tell what happened. To
his astonishment, the brass seemed willing to let the rape-murder be
forgotten.
   Finally Eriksson reached high enough authority to bring action.
The resulting court martial convicted the four major participants in
the crime, and Eriksson's testimony made him a pariah among his
fellow soldiers.
   David Rabe's script faithfully follows the events of Lang's
article (notable exception: the four were tried individually).
DePalma is expert at intense, stomach-churning action, and he deftly
contrasts the brutality of war with the lush beauty of the jungle
landscapes (actually Thailand).
   The film is told in retrospect as the civilian Eriksson's
nightmare returns while he studies an Oriental girl on an urban
train. Apparently Rabe and DePalma felt that such a framing was
necessary, but it doesn't work. The conclusion is a puzzling letdown.
   ``Casualties of War'' stars Michael J. Fox as Eriksson and Sean
Penn as Meserve. Fox is ideal as the innocent of the squad; his
growing toughness and his moral indignation add credulity to the
plot. Oddly, Penn is a disappointment. The war-hardened sergeant
would seem tailor-made for an actor of his intensity, but Penn never
gets a firm handle on Meserve, and much of his dialogue is garbled
by his constant tobacco chewing.
   The Columbia Pictures release was produced by Art Linson. The
rating is R for the rape scene and a vast amount of soldierly
swearing. Running time: 120 minutes.

   ``Whisper to a Scream'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $79.95. Rated R)
   
   ``Whisper to a Scream'' is an ordinary movie about serial
murders. In this case, the victims are nightclub dancers who get
sliced and diced by the sleazy joint's weirdo disc jockey.
   It's a an amateurish production at best, and one wonders why such
a distinguished actor as Yaphet Kotto would want to be in it. He
plays the police detective assigned to solve the murders.
   The dancers are supposedly artist types but they do tend to take
off their clothes a lot. In addition there are sexual situations,
strong language and, of course violence as the women are strangled
and stabbed.
   Nadia Capone plays a struggling young actress who gives up a
promising part to stay with her painter-lover (Silvio Oliviero). To
make ends meet she works in a backroom of the nightclub talking
suggestively to guys who apparently like to pay for obscene
telephone calls, including the weirdo deejay, who likes to record
the sounds of the dying females for his ultimate muscial
composition. He thinks of Capone as his muse.
   As he begins to stalk her as his final victim, she suspects her
lover of rubbing out her co-workers.
   All in all, the movie looks like it was slapped together by a
group of unemployed actors and actresses who decided to make a movie
over the weekend with rented equipment in someone's loft.

   ``Land Before Time'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $24.95. Rated G)
   
   ``The Land Before Time'' is one of the few animated children's
features of recent years that can hold a candle to the old Walt
Disney classics. No surprise that it's primarily the creation of Don
Bluth, who worked for Disney before he left to start his own company.
   The film tells the simple story of Littlefoot, a lovable baby
brontosaurus, who must make his way from his homeland, which is
being wracked by earthquakes and volcanoes, to a green oasis known
as the Great Valley.
   Along the way, Littlefoot is separated from his grandparents,
sees his mother killed, fights off the villainous Sharptooth and
makes friends with other young creatures of varying shapes and
species.
   Bluth and his co-producers, John Pomeroy and Gary Goldman, manage
to make these primordial characters appealing without being
sickeningly cute. The animation is inventive and the dramatic scenes
_ like the big earthquake or Sharptooth's attack _ extremely vivid.
   Very young children may be frightened by these parts and upset by
the mother's death. But aside from that caution, this is that rare
film that can honestly be recommended for viewers of all ages. It
even holds up under repeated watching.

   ``In Step'' (Columbia) _ Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble
   
   The first solo on ``In Step'' is taken by pianist Reese Wynans.
That's a surprise, but it underscores the fact that Stevie Ray
Vaughan's blues guitar is not the record's sole raison d'etre
(French for ``reason to be purchased'').
   Vaughan's guitar is a remarkably expressive instrument, true. But
``In Step'' offers even more.
   Wynans, drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon play with
the same fire as the star. Horns on two cuts add further punch.
   The tunes are nicely varied, from boogie-woogie (``The House Is
Rockin''') to shuffle (``Tightrope'') to slow 12-bar blues (Buddy
Guy's ``Leave my Girl Alone''). Two instrumentals also alter the
pace. And the sassy-sounding ``Scratch 'n' Sniff,'' with Vaughan
showing he can sing as fast as he plays, justifies the inclusion of
a lyrics sheet.
   Vaughan belongs on any list of the best popular, contemporary
bluesmen. His music is as gritty as George Thorogood's, yet as
graceful as Robert Cray's. And what a guitarist!

   Quintets for oboe and strings by Arnold Bax and Arthur Bliss;
Phantasy Quartet for oboe, violin, viola and cello, Op. 2, by
Benjamin Britten; Pamela Woods, oboe and the Audubon Quartet (Telarc)
   
   Telarc dipped into the Cleveland Orchestra for Pamela Woods,
assistant principal there and a journeywoman oboist who has played
with the Cincinnati, San Antonio and Baltimore orcehstras, for this
satisfying program of English oboe music.
   Add her fat tone, seamless lines and fine musicianship to the
superlative Audubon, and the result is an excellent disc. Woods'
rich, round sound, unburdened by a heavy vibrato, blends perfectly
with the quartet. All are equals. If any fault can be found, it is
that Ms. Woods is sometimes on the nonchalant side when the music
needs a little more heat.
   The program is coherent. The pieces were composed between 1922
and 1932, all inspired by the great English oboist Leon Goossens.
The Bax-Bliss-Britten order moves from less tonal complexity to
more. The pieces, most in the Bax and least in the Britten, have
elements of British folk tunes, and all revel in a richness of
texture.
   Bax, also a poet who published under the name Dermot O'Byrne, was
enamored of Ireland and travelled widely there. The quintet's folk
melodies, most apparent in the last movement, bear out that bit of
biography. The piece has a lush quality and reminds one of the Ravel
string quartet. Doris Lederer's viola solos are particularly
beautiful.
   Bliss, a World War I veteran, succeeded Bax as Master of the
Queen's Music, and his quintet sounds inspired by the Bax work. His
variety of colors is greater, and Britten's even greater still.
Britten was 18 when he finished his Phantasy; it is one of his
earliest mature works.

based on him in a new movie. But he thinks the actor has one thing
to learn.
   ``I've got to get Matthew a little bit more egotistical,'' Morgan
chuckled, referring to the star of ``Memphis Belle,'' which retraces
the 25th and last mission in 1943 of that B17 and the 10 men who
flew it.
   The movie, budgeted at $20.6 million, began its 10-week shoot in
Britain July 17. Modine, the 30-year-old star of ``Full Metal
Jacket'' and ``Birdy,'' co-stars with Eric Stoltz (``Mask,'' ``Some
Kind of Wonderful''), who is the radio operator, and D.B. Sweeney
(``Eight Men Out'') as the navigator.
   John Lithgow, the original star of ``M. Butterfly'' on Broadway,
plays the public relations officer who views the Memphis Belle
mission as a chance to boost both war bond sales and sagging morale.
   Michael Caton-Jones, the Glaswegian filmmaker who made
``Scandal,'' directs from a screenplay by Monte Merrick. The film is
co-produced by Catherine Wyler, daughter of the movie director
William Wyler, and David Puttnam, the British producer of ``Chariots
of Fire'' and ``The Mission.''
   ``Memphis Belle'' is due for release in the United States in
September 1990, and in Britain one month later.
   It is Puttnam's first movie project since he finished a
much-publicized Hollywood spell as chairman and chief executive of
Columbia Pictures two years ago. And the 48-year-old Puttnam hopes
it will counter films such as the 1986 blockbuster ``Top Gun,''
which he said glorified air combat.
   ``I couldn't work out what that film was about other than men
zooming around the skies,'' he said in an interview on the set at an
abandoned Royal Air Force base in Binbrook, Lincolnshire, 180 miles
northeast of London. ``I was wondering if it was possible to take
the technical qualities of `Top Gun' and use them in a dramatic film
about human beings.''
   Puttnam said he was inspired by a 1944 documentary by William
Wyler about the Memphis Belle. Wyler flew in the bomber five times
to get the footage.
   ``That was unashamedly a propaganda film made for a job, but it
did its job rather well,'' said Puttnam. ``We all agreed it was the
basis for a really good film.''
   ``Memphis Belle'' relates 24 hours before the bomber's final
mission, a successful raid over Bremen in northwest Germany. The
aircraft was then brought back to the United States, where the same
10-member crew flew it across the country as a propaganda exercise.
In May 1987, it was restored and is now on display in Memphis.
   In the film, five B17s were used for the flying sequences. One
crashed during filming July 25, injuring two technicians. None of
the stars was aboard.
   The characters in the movie are fictionalized versions of the
original crew, eight of whom are still alive and were flown to the
Lincolnshire location to help promote the movie.
   Eugene Adkins, an original Memphis Belle gunner now living in
Johnson City, Tenn., said the on-set visit was ``like Christmas to
us. ... I never dreamed it would ever happen again.''
   Robert Hansen, the crew's original radio operator, said Eric
Stoltz's equivalent character in the movie undergoes a more
difficult ordeal than Hansen did in the actual mission.
   ``They have a tough time bringing Eric through,'' said Hansen,
who lives in Mesa, Ariz. By contrast, Hansen said he was ``a zigger
and a zagger. When they were shooting at me, I zigged, and when the
bullets went by, I zagged so they didn't hit me.''
   Stoltz said he was enjoying the challenge.
   ``This is a completely new arena for me, which is what I really
enjoy about being an actor; it gives me a chance to play-act,'' said
the 27-year-old actor, a Tony nominee for his performance last
season in the Lincoln Center revival of Thornton Wilder's ``Our
Town.''
   ``It gives me a chance to be in the military, which is something
I would never do in reality,'' said Stoltz, who spent what he called
an ``ego-bashing week'' with the rest of the cast at a training camp
in Dartmoor in southern England.
   Stoltz said the enduring rapport of the real Memphis Belle
veterans was an inspiration: ``It's fun to see a group of men still
glad to be alive, still loving life and they're 70.''

<HEAD>Matthew Modine: A Good Film Role Is Hard To Find</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BINBROOK, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matthew Modine has been widely acclaimed
as one of America's best young film actors, but the star of
``Married to the Mob,'' ``Birdy'' and now ``Memphis Belle'' says
good screen roles are hard to find.
   ``It's just so hard to find something you want to work on,'' he
said over lunch during a break in filming ``Memphis Belle.''
   ``When there's something good around, everyone knows about it.''
   The 30-year-old actor increasingly has been getting a sizable
share of what's good. Though the California-born Modine has appeared
in flops such as ``Vision Quest'' and ``Mrs. Soffel,'' he's best
known for starring in two attention-grabbing films about the Vietnam
War: Alan Parker's ``Birdy'' and Stanley Kubrick's ``Full Metal
Jacket.''
   Movies, he said, have a responsibility to their audiences, so he
is selective.
   ``Maybe, if I were in straitened circumstances, I wouldn't be
able to choose,'' he said. ``But fortunately, I can afford not to
work. ... There's so much garbage you read that is repetitious.''
   Modine said he was drawn to ``Memphis Belle'' by its tale of 10
ordinary men who are transformed into heroes. ``Memphis Belle''
relates 24 hours before the celebrated bomber's final mission, a
successful raid over Bremen in northwest Germany. The aircraft was
then brought back to the United States, where the same 10-member
crew flew it across the country as a propaganda exercise. In May
1987, it was restored and is now on display in Memphis.
   ``The propaganda machine said these guys did it so they must be
extraordinary human beings,'' he said. ``In fact, they weren't. They
were just the ones who did it.''
   He said the film was a ```Das Boot' in the air,'' referring to
the 1981 German movie about a World War II U-boat mission.
   Next up, Modine will be seen as a medical student who falls in
love with his teacher, played by Christine Lahti, in Thom
Eberhardt's ``Gross Anatomy.'' Beyond that, he is interested in
making a film that links AIDS to a conspiracy by the World Health
Organization.
   ``There's enough proof that the WHO asked for it,'' he said,
adding that the film, as yet untitled and unwritten, would be
similar in tone to the 1979 hit movie about a nuclear accident,
``The China Syndrome.''
   ``It's quite frightening. If it (the disease) was commissioned,
if this is what happened with AIDS, then the ramifications are
huge,'' Modine said.

   Danny Ransom spent the first six months of
his career tediously making deformed electric guitars for $10 each.
   Today, he creates near-perfect instruments, veritable works of
art, that sell for as much as $4,000 to a list of clients that
includes some of the world's best-known musicians.
   The average large-scale guitar manufacturer can produce one
guitar body and a dozen guitar necks in about seven minutes. But a
craftsman such as Ransom spends several days, sometimes weeks, on a
single instrument.
   ``These huge companies pour out these glossy ads that say, `We
build the most perfect machine in the world,' and most of their
stuff is junk,'' he says. ``I've had to make sure every instrument
is right.''
   Ransom, 36, has been in the guitar-building business 13 years. He
has built guitars for members of the Grateful Dead, Santana and
Alabama. Laurie Anderson and Jean Luc Ponty play $4,000 synthesizer
violins he made for a company called Zeta.
   Experimental guitarist Henry Kaiser bought one of Ransom's
Stratocaster-style guitars last year from a friend. He says Ransom
understands the complexities of the instrument and how the different
parts interact.
   ``He's very sensitive to all those things that go beyond most
guitar makers,'' Kaiser said. ``It's just a versatile, expressive
instrument.''
   An independent contractor, Ransom works out of a sawdust-filled
studio adjacent to ``Real Guitars,'' a collector's guitar store.
   There was a time when he was low man on the guitar-maker totem
pole. He first worked for a huge custom guitar manufacturer, now
defunct, initially building what he calls ``the worst garbage.''
   Then 23, he was hired because one of the staff builders had a
habit of taking LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) on the job and
``talking to the tools.''
   ``The day the bandsaw turned into a serpent was the day I was
brought in,'' Ransom recalls. ``They stuck me in a room with a bunch
of tools, handed me a guitar and said, `Make these.'''
   His first guitars took weeks to build and earned him a whopping
$10 each. They were stacked up and sold as seconds or thrown out.
   One particular guitar stands out in his memory. It was the first
time he'd completed a carved top for a Les Paul-style guitar. The
final touches required a butane torch, and one of his bosses decided
to show him how it was done.
   ``At first, it got these little red embers, like little coals
burning on it,'' Ransom recalls. ``I said, `Do you know what you're
doing?' He said, `Shut up, of course I do.' Then the glue line
started to lift off and the thing burst into flames right in front
of us.
   ``If you can imagine putting out a fire with coffee cups. ...
This is like watching your child burn.''
   Things started to pick up after other builders began teaching
him. Ransom says the difference between a good guitar and a bad
guitar lies in the details, such as the curves in the wood and
placement of the finger board and joints.
   ``There's a real learning that goes on with figuring out detail.
The better you can adapt your eye to detail, the better you will get
at whatever you do in terms of craft. That's really what I got from
some of the people who helped me early on.''
   His guitars, usually Stratocaster and Telecaster styles, are made
mostly from alder, ash and maple. Ransom often visits lumber yards
armed with density and moisture meters to find the right wood. Soft
woods, such as mahogony, tend to give off more mid-range sound while
harder woods, such as poplar, produce the higher, treble sounds. He
has ebony shipped from India, rosewoods from Brazil and swamp ash
from Louisiana.
   Ransom traces the guitar bodies and necks on templates, bandsaws
them out, then screws the templates back on. He runs the body off on
a pinrouter. Last, instruments are shaped and sanded, and the elbows
and bellys are cut by hand.
   As a lithography major at San Francisco State in the 1970s,
Ransom had planned to become a cabinetmaker. Prior to that, his
experience working with wood was building matchstick holders and
other ``goofy little things'' when he was a Cub Scout.
   Although he is an admitted `Deadhead' _ Grateful Dead fan _
Ransom is not much of a musician. He sees that as more of an asset
than a liability for an electric guitar and violin maker.
   ``The guitar builders who have an understanding of music but
aren't players tend to be much more versatile in their building and
are much more involved in the quality of their instrument, not just
the sound or the playability, but the overall quality.''

   Being on the road is nothing new for Gloria
Estefan, who was just a baby when her family fled from Cuba.
   For 10 years, she and Miami Sound Machine toured the world,
attracting millions of listeners with the sounds of salsa, samba and
conga. With a string of hit singles, including ``Rhythm Is Gonna Get
You'' and the No. 1 ``Anything for You,'' the schedule moves at the
pace of their hottest music.
   But they do take a breather on occasion, to sing a slow song on
stage, enjoy the sunshine of their adopted city or record another
album.
   ``We tried to arrange the album the way we try to do a show,''
Estefan said of their new record, ``Cuts Both Ways,'' a collection
of dance songs and ballads.
   ``You try to get a feeling. We really focused on how we could
make the people relax, have moments in the show to settle back and
then build it to a party atmosphere.''
   With their crossover ability beyond question, Miami Sound Machine
has decided to step back a bit on ``Cuts Both Ways,'' performing two
songs in Spanish and adding a stronger Latin beat.
   ``This band has spent two years touring together,'' said Estefan,
whose husband, Emilio, founded the group and now produces their
records. ``All the songs are ours, it was arranged by us, it was
co-produced by Emilio and two of the guys in the band. It was the
first time we had the opportunity to do that.
   ``We felt freer on this record. The Latin music is interwoven
into our songs a lot more. One song, `Get on Your Feet,' is not
Latin at all but has a Latin break in the middle.''
   What concerns Estefan more than anything else is the increasing
tendency to refer to the group as ``Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound
Machine,'' or just ``Gloria Estefan.'' She has no desire to follow
the path of pop stars such as Diana Ross and Deborah Harry, who left
their bands behind to pursue a solo career.
   ``If you were to pinpoint what Miami Sound Machine is, it would
be Emilio,'' Estefan said. ``It was a musical idea he had all along.
The only original member is me. The sound that was produced in the
studio was Emilio's.''
   She grew up Glorita Fajardo, the shy daughter of a former
bodyguard for the wife of deposed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.
Music was at that time, literally, a dream; she would imagine
herself on stage, dressed in black, picking up thick black coils.
   ``I was into music almost when I started talking. I would learn
all these songs and sing them,'' she said.
   She impressed relatives with her ability to memorize poetry and
was soon writing her own. As a teen-ager, she and her cousin would
strum guitars and sing at high school assemblies.
   ``I was staring at the floor because my friends would want me to
do it. They would hound me to death. We'd be at home and my mom
would drag out my guitar for her firends and I'd sing.''
   Emilio Estefan was a popular local musician, leader of the
``Miami Latin Boys,'' when he helped Gloria and some friends put
together a show for her parents.
   She was finishing high school at the time and heard little of him
until his band played at a wedding attended by Gloria and her family.
   ``I didn't want to go; my mother dragged me,'' she recalled.
``They were playing and he said, `I remember you' and asked me to
sing some songs with the band, who hated to have anyone sit in.
   ``We did two standards and `What a Difference a Day Makes.' I
just followed along. I have a good ear and we got a standing ovation
because everybody knew me since I was a child.''
   She had thoughts of majoring in psychology but eventually agreed
to join Estefan's band. Estefan can still remember the date of their
first concert, Oct. 25, 1975, when stage fright kept her from doing
little more than shake maracas.
   While Miami's K.C. and the Sunshine Band dominated the pop
charts, Miami Sound Machine took hold of the Spanish market,
starting with their very first single, the ballad ``Renacer.''
   They spent the next decade as the world's only arena-wedding band.
   ``We'd go to Latin America and play huge stadiums, 50,000 people,
and then we'd go back to Miami and play a wedding, maybe 300
people,'' Estefan said.
   ``We were on Latin radio, and little by little, maybe because
they could identify with the way I worded things, we became more
popular. Parents started saying their kids were listening to our
music even though they hated Latin music.''
   Pop success started in early 1986 with the Top 10 single
``Conga'' and hasn't let up. Perserverance, she says, is the secret.
Also the songs, like the ballad ``Don't Wanna Lose You'' off ``Cuts
Both Ways.''
   ``We played the song for the cousin of someone in the band. She
was a high school student, coming up for a school paper. She came in
while we were mixing it and sat down. By the end of the song, she
was crying. I thought, ``That's it, the tear test.'''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Mary Kay Blakely learned a lot about life
during the nine days she hovered, near death, in a coma.
   With the help of her friends and family, she revived. And with
their assistance and with her own vivid recollections, she has
pieced together a travelogue of her journey through the dream state,
commencing on March 23, 1984.
   When her lover, Larry, tried to wake her that morning, she
discovered she had no contact with her eyelids. ``Further
experiments proved that I couldn't swallow or move my limbs, clear
my throat or clasp my hand.
   ``When he spoke or touched me, I heard and felt him, but couldn't
speak or touch in return. ... But in the benevolent atmosphere of my
dream, I felt more curiosity than alarm, if I could claim any
feelings at all,'' Blakely writes in her new book, ``Wake Me When
It's Over'' (Times Books, $17.95).
   ``It was as though I were sitting alone in the back of a huge
auditorium for a private, unedited screening of my life. It was
strange to watch familiar scenes without feeling the attendant
embarrassment or anger or joy they usually inspired.''
   Doctors said her coma was caused by diabetes, surgery and other
medical problems. But Blakely _ a freelance writer whose work
appeared among The New York Times' ``Hers'' columns and in national
magazines _ says it was triggered by divorce; severe financial
strain; her brother's suicide _ and the hectic lifestyle of the
1980s.
   ``I cannot recommend a coma as a cure for depression and
stress,'' she said. ``In my case, it did solve a lot of problems.
But I like to think that there are other, less damaging routes to
the same information.''
   The warning signals were there. ``Everybody in my life could see
that I was exhausted. But I think we start to look at women as if
being exhausted is a normal state for them,'' she said. ``We have
forgotten what normal looks like and feels like.''
   The coma jolted her loved ones into action. She says her bubbly,
eccentric sister, Gina, literally talked her into living; her
feminist friends united in an ``energy circle'' to bring her out of
orbit.
   Later, they helped fill in the details as she reconstructed the
experience. And perhaps because there was no brain damage, she awoke
with ``a clear recollection of my dreams, the almost hallucinatory
moments of the coma. As in all dreams, you feel certain stimulation
and your mind kind of spins out.''
   She wrote about the hallucinations and the things she heard.
   ``I knew I was in a hospital because I heard two of the staff
members talking over my head about how hard it was to live in New
York City on a resident's income. But I didn't always interpret what
was going on rationally,'' she said.
   ``Sounds and voices I identified as real actions, real people,
would suddenly melt into the bizarre plots and characters of surreal
dreams,'' she wrote. ``It was as though my brain were leaking badly,
bleeding fact into fiction until reality was as unreliable as a
melting Dali timepiece.
   ``Far in the distance, I heard the light chatter of female voices
conversing, coffee-break style, above the low broadcast of a radio.
A four o'clock traffic report warned commuters about delays in the
Holland and Lincoln tunnels, and I made a mental note to avoid those
routes on the way home.''
   She recalled hospital workers parting her hair and applying a
paste before a brain activity test. It was ``the most amazing
thing,'' she remembered thinking. ``This was the weirdest goddamn
prison! After they suctioned your lungs, they frizzed your hair!''
   ``I suppose the favorite part of it was, once I was able to
comprehend this material, that's when my sense of humor returned,''
she said in an interview.
   As she awoke, she was confused to see an incongruous assortment
of family and friends, including one from Alaska, at her bedside.
   ``Maybe we were all in Juneau, Alaska, reaching the end of an
all-night pig roast,'' she thought. ``Everyone looked slightly
intoxicated, smiling with nonsensical joy but showing visible signs
of wear. It must have been some wild party _ I wasn't feeling all
that hot myself.''
   She has since reflected on the feelings of love and well-being,
the mysterious light that beckoned her through the coma.
   ``Here I am, an agnostic, having what is the equivalent of a
spiritual experience,'' she said.
   Was it the drugs? She and her doctors don't know, and ``my
feeling now is, that is the state we reach near death.
   ``It's completely altered my feelings about death. I don't regard
it any more as a terrifying alternative to life,'' she said.
``Without any contact with my body, I still existed as thought. It's
a very comforting notion that whatever is uniquely human about us
continues to exist.''
   The experience helped her deal with her brother's death. Gripped
by manic depression, Frank Blakely had killed himself, leaving
behind his writings.
   ``The reason we have suffering,'' he wrote, ``is that progress
can only be achieved at a price, because goodness has to be made out
of badness, and the raw material has to be refined by fire and mixed
with alloys before it can become strong.''
   Those words inspired his sister in her own odyssey. ``His
experience with that illness and his real heroism in dealing with it
_ he had this admirable courage and he was so able to articulate
what his experience with madness was like _ was always valuable to
me,'' the author said.

<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chris Hillman considers the Desert Rose Band the
best band in which he has ever been.
   In fact, he'd just as soon not even talk about the others,
including the most famous one, the Byrds _ which he and Roger
McGuinn founded just 25 years ago _ and the Flying Burrito Brothers.
   Country music fans like the Desert Rose Band, too. They've made
five straight singles go No. 1 on the best-selling country chart.
And ``Hello Trouble'' is climbing toward the top.
   The band also is nominated as vocal group of the year in the
upcoming Country Music Association awards, for song of the year for
``I Still Believe in You'' and for the Horizon Award, the
association's highest honor.
   Hillman and McGuinn are nominated for country event of the year,
for a performance at Red Rocks in Colorado. Their duet, ``You Ain't
Going Nowhere,'' also is on the current country singles chart.
   ``This band feels the best,'' Hillman says. ``The others never
felt right. The Byrds felt OK. It was such a diverse group of
individuals it self-destructed. This feels like the chemistry is
right.
   ``The six of us are trying to think alike, trying to focus
everybody's vision into one vision.
   ``This has got the best players and singers. It has proven itself
with the chart singles. We're right on the track. A man would be a
fool to wreck this train _ give me a pen, I've got a song title.''
   Guitarist John Jorgenson says, ``In Nashville, everyone is a
songwriter. Every third or fourth line of conversation, somebody
says, `That would be a good song.'''
   In January, Hillman, McGuinn and David Crosby performed as the
Byrds in Los Angeles, trying to trademark the name, countering an
attempt by the group's original drummer, Michael Clarke, to use it.
   ``They talk about re-forming the Byrds,'' Hillman says. ``I don't
think that is going to happen. The Byrds would be wonderful to do if
it didn't interfere with the Desert Rose Band.
   ``I love the other guys but I don't want to look over my
shoulder. This is something that's challenging right now. It takes
enough of my time just to keep abreast of the business and try and
come up with something unique each time we jump into the studio.''
   After the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Stephen Stills'
Manassas, Souther-Hillman-Furay, McGuinn Clark &amp; Hillman and time
out for spiritual stocktaking, Hillman cut two solo country albums
for Sugar Hill Records: ``Morning Sky'' and ``Desert Rose.''
   In his teens in San Diego County, he played in country bands
before he and McGuinn created folk-rock with the Byrds and he and
Gram Parsons pushed on into country-rock with the Burritos.
   ``You don't have to be from Kentucky to hear country music,''
Hillman says. ``In the '30s people came to California from
Appalachia, the Midwest and Texas because of the Dust Bowl. In World
War II, came the aircraft industry and then the housing boom which
attracted people from the Southeast, South and Midwest. They brought
their music with them _ hence the real country music style from
California.''
   In 1985, Hillman formed a quartet to open shows for Dan
Fogelberg. He named it the Desert Rose Band when he later added two
more players, making it an electric band with the ability to play
acoustic.
   ```Desert Rose' was one of my songs,'' Hillman says. ``It was a
nickname for somebody's child. I like the song. I've been toying
with the idea of recutting it with this bunch. These guys can play
and sing it better.''
   During a January 1986 booking at the Palomino in North Hollywood,
a Curb Records executive heard the band and later signed it. The
second LP on Curb, ``Running,'' came out last November. Curb is
distributed by MCA.
   Guitarist John Jorgenson, who was interviewed with Hillman in
MCA's office, says that the band early on performed songs from
Hillman's ``Desert Rose'' album.
   Hillman wrote most of the songs on ``Running,'' collaborating
with Steve Hill, a friend from Ventura, Calif. ``I write. We work it
out, see how she flies,'' he said.
   ``Hopefully it retains the personality of the band,'' Jorgenson
said. ``You've got the same six guys playing it, putting their ideas
and feelings into it. On our latest single, we've been hearing that
people listening to it say, `That must be the Desert Rose Band.'''
   Other band members are guitarist Herb Pedersen, Jay Dee Maness on
pedal steel, bassist Bill Bryson and drummer Steve Duncan.
   The hit singles include ``One Step Forward'' and ``He's Back and
I'm Blue'' from the 1987 ``The Desert Rose Band,'' and ``Summer
Wind,'' ``I Still Believe in You,'' ``She Don't Love Nobody'' and
``Hello Trouble'' from ``Running.''
   The band, touring since March 1, took off June to finish
recording a third album for January release.

   Wholesale prices, driven downward by new car
discounts and cheaper gasoline, fell 0.4 percent in July, their
biggest drop in three years, the Labor Department said.
   The Commerce Department also said Friday retail sales jumped 0.9
percent last month and that consumer spending in May and June had
not been as sluggish as previously thought.
   Analysts said the double dose of good economic news showed
inflationary pressures were easing and that the economy was in no
danger of tumbling into a recession.

<HEAD>Big Eight Whittled Down As Touche Ross, Deloitte Merge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Big Eight accounting group is down to the
six. The talk now is of the Giant Five.
   The firms Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and Touche Ross &amp; Co. said
Sunday their partners had approved a merger that will create a
worldwide firm with annual revenue of more than $4 billion.
   The merger of the two agencies, first announced last month, is
the second this year among elite U.S. accounting firms, reducing
the so-called Big Eight by two. In addition, two more top firms are
discussing a possible union.
   ``The Big Eight is gone,'' said Arthur Bowman, editor of the
Atlanta-based industry newsletter Bowman's Accounting Report. ``I'm
already calling it the Giant Five.''
   In May, Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young &amp; Co. agreed to combine
operations in a firm with worldwide revenue of $4.2 billion and
domestic revenue of $2 billion. That deal is completed and the new
firm, Ernst &amp; Young, formally begins operations Oct. 1.
   Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. and Price Waterhouse last month confirmed
they are discussing merging to form the world's largest accounting
firm. Analysts said the firms plan three more weeks of confidential
negotiations and the union is expected to go through.
   Analysts have attributed the merger wave in part to competition
in Europe leading to 1992, when the 12-nation European Economic
Community plans to implement a border-free market.
   A statement Sunday by the firms said the partners of Deloitte
and Touche Ross _ the smallest of the old Big Eight _ approved the
merger at separate meetings in Dallas last week.
   The new firm, to be known as Deloitte &amp; Touche in the United
States, will have 20,000 employees and projected 1989 revenue of
nearly $2 billion domestically and 65,000 employees and projected
1989 revenue of more than $2 billion in 100 other countries.
   ``This positions Deloitte and Touche near the top of the heap,
which is where neither one has ever been,'' Bowman said. ``It will
be interesting to see if they can continue to be the aggressive
upstarts they have been.''
   Touche Ross is considered strongest in the Far East with
Deloitte a major presence in Europe.
   Internationally, the new firm will be known as Deloitte Ross
Tohmatsu International. It will draw on the expertise of Japan's
largest audit firm, Tohmatsu Awoki &amp; Sanwa, a member of the Touche
Ross International organization.
   Partners outside the United States are expected to approve the
merger in votes in the next two months, the firms said.
   Despite their ranking at the bottom of the Big Eight, Deloitte
and Touche have posted the most rapid growth in recent years.
   According to Bowman, their average individual worldwide revenue
jumped more than 88 percent from 1985 to 1988. Last year their
worldwide growth averaged 26 percent, compared with an 22 percent
for the other Big Eight firms.
   Deloitte in 1988 had $820 million U.S. revenue and $1.92 billion
in international revenue, while Touche Ross had $796 million U.S.
revenue and $1.84 billion in worldwide revenue.
   Deloitte's audit clients include General Motors, Kimberly-Clark,
Monsanto and Procter &amp; Gamble. Touche Ross clients include American
Motors, Chrysler, Litton Industries and Pillsbury.
   An Andersen-Waterhouse merger would create a firm with $5
billion a year in projected worldwide revenue and $2.7 billion in
projected U.S. revenue, displacing the new Ernst &amp; Young at the top.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was mixed today in early European
trading. Gold prices were little changed.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar was supported by a wave
of buying enthusiasm and short-covering unleashed Friday by
diminished prospects that the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease
interest rates.
   Profit-taking by banks was working against the dollar, other
dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.83 yen to a closing 141.93 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 141.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.9378 West German marks, down from 1.9390;
1.6755 Swiss francs, up from 1.6705; 6.5480 French francs, up from
6.5455; 2.1848 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1685; 1,393.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,388.00; and 1.1745 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1754.
   In London, the dollar fell slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.5882 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5850 late Friday.
   Gold was steady in quiet trading and bullion dealers said the
market was watching the dollar for clues to the metal's near-term
direction.
   Gold opened in London at $362.55 a troy ounce, compared with
late Friday's $362. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $363.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $362.90, up from $361 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 7 cents to close at $364.30.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.17 a troy ounce, up from
Friday's $5.10.

   The U.S. dollar rose today against the Japanese yen
for the third consecutive trading day while prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange declined.
   The dollar closed at 141.93 yen, up 1.83 yen from last Friday's
close of 140.10 yen. It opened at 141.85 yen and ranged between
141.48 yen and 141.95 yen. The dollar now has climbed 3.08 yen in
three trading days.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which fell 6.84 points in
trading Friday, declined another 41.34 points, or 0.12 percent,
closing at 34,671.62 points.
   The U.S. currency's gain in Tokyo today followed its rise in New
York last Friday, when newly announced producer price and retail
price figures indicated stability in the American economy, analysts
said.
   But Yasuo Miyakawa, an analyst for Sumitomo Bank, said Tokyo's
exchange market was relatively quiet Monday.
   ``Dealers are waiting for the announcements of the U.S. trade
statistics and the consumer price index later this week,'' he said.
   The stock market was quiet too.
   ``With the beginning of the summer vacation, there is nothing
new today,'' said a trader with Yamaichi Securities, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Nikkei average lost 85.61 points in the morning but
recovered somewhat in the afternoon.
   The trader said Sony shares were bought, but no other single
issue attracted particular attention.
   A relatively light total of 380 million shares traded hands.

   Ole Bardahl, the founder of a worldwide
manufacturing company whose name appeared on motor oil additives,
hydroplanes, race cars and racing airplanes, died Friday of
emphysema. He was 87.
   Bardahl, who died at Ballard Community Hospital which he helped
establish, was born in Trondheim, Norway. He immigrated to the
United States in 1922, arriving in Seattle with $32 to his name.
   In 1939, Bardahl bought a small soap and cleansers manufacturing
company that became Bardahl Manufacturing Corp. and eventually had
operations in 70 countries.
   But it was motor sports that gave him much of his fame.
   He introduced his first Miss Bardahl hydroplane in 1957, and
went on to win six national hydroplane championships, five Gold
Cups and two world championships. He also sponsored race cars for
21 years in the Indianapolis 500 and a championship P-51 airplane
named Miss Bardahl.
   Besides his wife, Inga, Bardahl is survived by two daughters,
seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

   The stock market opened lower in moderate, early
trading today as investors continued to take profits after last
week's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.36 points at
2,679.63 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by about 8 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 600 issues down, 365 up and 490 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.9 million shares.
   Market analysts said profit-taking carried over from late Friday
was helping depress prices.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.43 at 191.84.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was off
0.42 at 380.22.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 28.64 at
2,683.99, after surpassing the all-time high during the session of
2,722.42, the level it reached on Aug. 25, 1987. The market had
tested that high on Thursday, closing at 2,712.63.
   The market got a strong start Friday from a report that the
producer price index declined 0.4 percent in July, suggesting
inflationary pressures had eased, but retreated after taking a
closer look at last month's retail sales figures.
   Brokers said a surprisingly robust 0.9 percent increase in
retail sales contributed to doubts that the Federal Reserve would
relax its credit policy further in the near future.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
586 up, 934 down and 477 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 197.55 million
shares, against 198.66 million in Thursday's session.

<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. reported a 10.9 percent decline
in second-quarter earnings Monday, due largely to
weaker-than-expected sales in May and lower shelf prices.
   The nation's second-largest retailer said it earned $145
million, or 72 cents a share, on revenue of $7.01 billion during
the company's second quarter this year, ended July 26.
   That compared with earnings of $162.8 million, or 81 cents a
share, on revenue of $6.68 billion during the same period last year.
   ``Unfortunately, weak sales in May resulted in below-plan sales
for the second quarter,'' K mart Chairman Joseph Antonini said.
``This sales shortfall from plan combined with lower gross margins
on items that have been reduced in price, causing a decline in
earnings for the second quarter.''
   For the six months ended July 26, the company said profits were
down 15.7 percent, falling to $239.1 million, or $1.19 a share,
from $283.6 million, or $1.41 a share, during the same time last
year.
   Revenue for the period this year were $13.07 billion, up 4.4
percent from sales of $12.53 billion last year.
   K mart operated 4,135 outlets at the end of the period,
including K mart discount stores, Waldenbooks, Builders Square and
Pay Less Drug stores.
   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. is the only U.S. retailer larger than K
mart.

   Directors of Elders IXL Ltd. on Monday rejected
an offer by Harlin Holdings Pty. Ltd. that values the Australian
conglomerate at $4.1 billion.
   Harlin, a closely-held concern controlled by Elders executives
including company chairman John Elliott, has offered to buy Elders
for 3 Australian dollars a share, or a total of about 5.4 billion
Australian dollars.
   Elders' board, as expected, told shareholders Monday Harlin's
offer did not reflect the full value of the company.
   The directors cited a report by Elders' advisers, the investment
firm First Boston Australia Ltd., that valued the company's shares
at between 3.36 Australian dollars and 3.79 Australian dollars.
   Harlin already owns about 18 percent of Elders. Its offer for
all of the company is aimed at appeasing critics who say
shareholders are entitled to the same price that Harlin plans to
pay for an additional 17 percent jointly owned by AFP Group PLC and
Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd.
   A number of international companies have agreed to supply Harlin
with funds to help it finance the offer for Elders.
   The companies, which agreed to buy new shares in Harlin, thereby
taking an indirect stake in Elders, are: Molson Cos., Prudential
Bache Interfunding Inc., Compagnie Financiere de Suez, Hong Kong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corp., and Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Harlin also has arranged debt funding for its offer.
   Elders' businesses include brewing, agriculture, financial
services and resources.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has received
$180,000 from McDonnell Douglas Corp. as a civil penalty for
failing to maintain its approved quality control program for MD-80
jetliners, the FAA's Northwest Mountain Region office said.
   On Feb. 24, 1988, the FAA cited McDonnell Douglas for allegedly
violating federal aviation regulations by failing to incorporate a
mandatory design change in the manufacture of 171 of its
twin-engine MD-80s. Payment of the fine was announced on Friday.
   The design change required the Long Beach, Calif., plane builder
to harden areas around the attachment holes of a ``doubler'' or
reinforcing part for the planes' upper anti-collision light to
prevent fatigue cracking. The doubler strengthens the structure
around the light and attaches the light housing to the airplane.
   The hardening process, called stess coining, increases
resistance to fatigue cracking, guarding against possible
strucutral failure and depressurization in flight, the FAA said.
   The FAA found fatigue cracking in doublers of earlier DC-9
airplanes and issued an airworthiness directive on Dec. 17, 1985,
for all DC-9s in service. The directive ordered either stress
coining of the doubler or repeated inspections for cracking after
planes had 30,000 flights.
   At the same time, the FAA approved the design change to modify
the doubler on all MD-80 airplanes in production. The MD-80 is
McDonell Douglas's designation for later-model DC-9s.
   Since 120 MD-80s were produced and delivered without the
required design change, the FAA has since revised the airworthiness
directive to include those planes for repeated inspections or the
doubler modification.
   Another 51 aircraft were produced without the modified doubler
but the deficiency was discovered and corrected before they were
delivered to customers.
   The FAA originally proposed a $200,000 fine for McDonnell
Douglas but FAA spokesman David Duff said that was reduced after
the manufacturer showed it had complied with some provisions of the
design change. Duff said the fine was received by the FAA on Aug. 1.

   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade after heavier-than-expected rain fell
over the weekend, analysts said.
   The weak tone of early trading also reflected a lack of
enthusiasm over last week's Agriculture Department harvest figures,
said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with LIT America Inc. in Chicago. The
USDA is projecting lower than expected grain and soybean production.
   Wheat futures appear to have some support because of
expectations of a major purchase by the Soviet Union. However,
rumors of a Soviet grain purchase have been around for some time
now.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 2} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.96 a bushel; corn was 4
cents to 4\ cents lower with September at $2.30 a bushel; oats were
5 cents to 5} cents lower with September at $1.36{ a bushel;
soybeans were 15 cents to 15\ cents lower with August at $6 a
bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures higher in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle was .02 cent to .05 cent lower with August at 74.67
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .33 cent higher with
August at 85.25 cents a pound; hogs were .015 cent lower to .35
cent higher with August at 46.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .30 cent to 1.68 cents higher with August at 25.40 cents a
pound.
   Livestock prices settled mixed and pork prices settled higher in
Friday's trading.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced today that four companies
have agreed to recall approximately
250,000 hair dryers that the commission believes present a danger of electrocution.
   In announcing the voluntary recall, the commission said it estimates
that 17 Americans die each year of accidental electrocution
by hair dryers, usually when they are dropped into bathtubs.
   Anne Graham, acting chairman of the commission, said that from eight
to 10 of the victims are usually children, often playing
with the hair dryers as toys.
   The firms and the hair dryers involved in the recall are MBR Industries
Inc. of Miami, Fla, maker of Pomair Pro 2100 and 1900;
Mustang Electronics Inc., of Hallandale, Fla., maker of Mustang MU 2100;
Major International, Inc. of Orange, Calif., maker of Major
Styling Dryer Model 1250; and China Bazaar of San Francisco, Minimate Hair
Dryer and Iron DS-601.
   The commission said all of the Minimate dryers had been stopped in
inventory before being sold to consumers.
   Consumers who purchased any of the other dryers can return them to
the store where they bought them and receive a refund or
replacement, Ms. Graham said.
   ``In addition to recalling the hair dryers, these firms have agreed
to market only hair dryers which meet acceptable minimum
safety levels,'' she said. ``This means that they are contacting their
foreign suppliers and demanding a safer product.''
   David Schmeltzer, the commission's associate executive director for
compliance and administrative litigation, said virtually all
hair dryers sold in the United States are imported.
   He said the dryers that are being recalled fail to meet a voluntary
standard laid down in 1987 that requires a device to avoid
any fatal leakage of current when the dryer enters the water with the switch
in the ``off'' position.
   Schmeltzer said there are still some 80 million hair dryers in the
hands of consumers that do not meet this voluntary standard,
and the staff is contacting other firms seeking additional recalls.
   ``Most consumers have the erroneous idea that when a hair dryer is
turned off it does not create an electrocution hazard,''
Schmeltzer said. ``This is simply not the case.''

<HEAD>Yen Pit Trader Pleads Innocent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Chicago Mercantile Exchange yen pit trader pleaded innocent
today to charges stemming from the FBI's
probe of suspected fraud in the world's largest futures markets.
   Michael Sidel, 42, of Lake Forest, entered the plea before U.S. District
Judge George M. Marovich. He is the 13th yen trader to
plead innocent.
   Forty-six traders from the Merc and from the Chicago Board of Trade
were indicted Aug. 2 on charges ranging from pre-arranged
trading to racketeering, conspiracy and tax fraud.
   The indictments stem from a 2{-year undercover FBI investigation into
trading practices at the two exchanges. The probe is
continuing and more indictments are expected this fall.
   Sidel, accused of defrauding his customers, is charged with one count
of violating the Commodities Exchange Act and one count of
mail fraud.
   Sidel and the other 12 former yen traders all deny charges they took
part in alleged schemes to pocket profits from trades made
for customers while passing on their own trading losses to customers.
   Five people have pleaded guilty so far in the investigation.
   Anthony Onesto, Sidel's attorney, said he expects former yen pit trader
Thomas Braniff to testify against his client. Braniff,
33, pleaded guilty last week to two counts of violating the exchange act
and two counts of mail fraud.

<HEAD>Kodak Chairman Says He Thought Company Would Win Polaroid Patent
Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. Chairman Colby Chandler testified today he knew that
getting involved in instant photography
could mean a lawsuit from competitor Polaroid Corp., but he said he was
convinced his company would win.
   Chandler testified in a U.S. District Court trial that will determin
how much Kodak owes Polaroid for infringing on patents for
instant-developing film.
   Asked if he had felt there was a chance Kodak's introduction of an
instant camera in the mid-1970s could provoke a suit from
Polaroid, Chandler answered, ``Yes.''
   But he said, ``I felt we had reduced the risk to such a low level it
was not a major consideration.''
   An earlier federal court decision already established that Kodak infringed
on the patents of Polaroid, the Massachusetts-based
pioneer of instant photography.
   Polaroid is seeking $12 billion, which would be a record award in a
patent infringement suit, while Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak
has argued it should pay $177 million, an amount equal to a royalty of
5 percent on the cameras and film it sold from 1976 to 1985.
   Chandler testified before Judge A. David Mazzone that Kodak's corporate
policies clearly state, ``We will not knowingly violate
or infringe'' another company's patents.
   Asked if he had any reason to believe that policy was violated when
Kodak entered the instant film business, Chandler said, ``No,
I did not.''
   Chandler said he relied on advice from the company's attorneys in deciding
that Kodak's product would not infringe on Polaroid's
patents.
   Asked if he had any reason to believe at the time the advice was faulty,
Chandler testified, ``No, I did not.''
   In May, Polaroid Chairman William J. McClune Jr testfied that Polaroid
and Eastman Kodak had a productive working relationship
for decades, with Kodak making film for Polaroid, but that things soured
in the late 1960s when Polaroid introduced its SX-70 camera.
   Kodak, McClune said, was asked to produce the new, complex negative
that Polaroid had developed for that instant color camera.
But he said Kodak demanded a license from Polaroid, which would have allowed
Kodak to develop its own instant photography.
   Polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities in
Massachusetts.
   McCune testified then that instant photography is Polaroid's ``bread
and butter'' and that Kodak's introduction of instant film
and cameras cut deeply into his company's profits.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has chosen Richard C. Breeden, the White House point
man on landmark savings-and-loan
legislation, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, administration
sources said today.
   The formal nomination was expected later in the day, said the sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The post requires
Senate confirmation.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater all but confirmed Breeden's
selection. ``Let's say that Mr. Breeden is an
outstanding candidate and I don't know that we have an announcement on
it today, but we expect to soon,'' Fitzwater said.
   Breeden, 39, a lawyer and banking specialist, would succeed David S.
Ruder, who announced in May that he intended to step down.
   Breeden helped write President Bush's plan for bailing out the nation's
ailing savings and loan industry, and represented the
White House in dealings with Congress as that legislation progressed through
Congress.
   The final plan, a major restructuring of federal banking laws and the
largest single-industry government bailout in history, took
effect with Bush's signature last week.
   Breeden, whose current job as presidential assistant for issues analysis
made him something of a White House troubleshooter, also
helped fashion administration policy for dealing with the Alaska oil spill.
   From 1982-85 Breeden was deputy counsel to then-Vice President Bush.
He came to the White House after four years in private
practice as a banking specialist in the Washington office of a Houston
law firm.
   The SEC is a five-member board that oversees securities markets, regulates
the sale of stocks, bonds and stock options and
enforces securities laws.
   Ruder, an appointee of former President Reagan, has been chairman of
the regulatory body since Aug. 7, 1987, some 2{ months
before the stock market crash.
   He announced last May that he wanted to step down, and would stay on
until a successor was selected. Ruder plans to return to
Northwestern University Law School, where he formerly taught.
   Breeden's nomination was not expected to run into any difficulties
in the Senate, which where he is reportedly well respected.

<HEAD>Rig Count Drops by 16 to Total 858</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After posting several increases in recent weeks,
the number of working oil and gas rigs in the nation declined by 16
this week to total 858, Baker Hughes Inc. reports.
   The rig count last week was 874, an increase of four from the
previous week. In the last 11 weeks, the rig count has increased
eight times.
   A year ago, the count totaled 940, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The company's rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma lost six rigs,
Wyoming's count was down by five and Texas had a decrease of four.
New Mexico and California each lost two, and Colorado lost one.
   Louisiana's rig count was up for four, North Dakota's increased
by two and Michigan gained one more rig.

   The White House today backed away from a
contention by President Bush's budget director that the Federal
Reserve Board is inviting a recession by keeping interest rates too
high.
   ``Our policy is to want continued economic growth with low
inflation,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We
believe the economy is generally on that course at the present time
and the Fed is doing a good job.''
   ``The Fed is aware of our policy objectives and we believe that
they share our concern for continuing economic growth,'' Fitzwater
added.
   Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and
Budget, sounded an alarm on central bank policy Sunday.
   ``I'm fearful that (Fed policymakers) have been a little bit too
concerned that things have been going well, and that they may have
been a bit too tight'' on interest rates, Darman said on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
   ``If we do have a recession, it will be because they have erred
on the side of caution,'' said Darman. ``... I think it's quite
important that the Fed appreciate that growth is indeed fundamental
to the health of this economy, and that they not become too obsessed
with concern about things going well for too long.''
   Darman's television interview prompted a humorous exchange
between himself and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter today at a
bill-signing ceremony at the White House.
   ``You were kind of ornery yesterday,'' a smiling Yeutter called
across the room to Darman. ``What do you mean?'' Darman replied.
``Work on it a little bit more, Dick,'' Yeutter said. ``I want to
refinance my home.''
   Fitzwater was careful not to criticize Darman.
   ``Dick is the director of the Office of Management and Budget,''
the spokesman said. ``He is a part of the economic team. We share
his thinking. He shares our thinking. But we think generally we're
on the right course here.''
   Fed spokesman Joseph Coyne said the agency would have no comment
on Darman's assertions.
   The U.S. economy has posted a record peacetime expansion since
emerging from the 1980-81 recession. The Fed began pushing interest
rates up in March 1988 when it began sensing that inflationary
pressures were building.
   However, the central bank changed course last June after
detecting weakness in the economy and has made three modest moves
since then to lower interest rates.
   But Darman called the moves insufficient, saying: ``I would say,
insofar as we are concerned about recession, we should all worry a
little bit about the Fed.''
   ``I think that there's no reason for us to have a recession,'' he
said. ``It's not necessary, if there is sensible management on the
parts of ourselves and the Fed.''
   Darman said he has shared his views with Greenspan and indicated
he did not see the perceived problem as the Fed chairman's alone.
   ``... I think we're (the Bush administration) under sensible
management, and it's important not merely that Chairman Greenspan
but the other members of the board and the (policy-setting Federal
Open Market Committee) that makes the crucial decisions on this ...
be more attentive to the need to avoid tipping this economy into a
recession,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lawyers in Eastern Case File For $7.4 Million in Fees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the lawyers involved in Eastern Airlines'
5-month-old bankruptcy case have filed applications for fees for
their work, amounting to a total of $7.4 million.
   Law firms representing Eastern, a committee of its major
creditors and a court-appointed bankruptcy examiner filed the
applications during the past week or so, a clerk in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court said.
   Altogether, at least 135 lawyers have worked on the case since
Miami-based Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on
March 9, five days after the start of a crippling strike. Eastern
has filed a reorganization plan to rebuild to an airline two-thirds
of its pre-strike size.
   ``Bankruptcy is a trough and all of the animals in the barnyard
come to feed in it,'' Bruce Simon, the lead attorney in the case for
the Air Line Pilots Association, said Monday. ``Especially in a
bankruptcy context, the fees that are paid typically are
outrageous.''
   The $7.4 million in fees, which must be paid out of Eastern's
assets, covers the first four months of the proceeding. The
applications must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland, who has scheduled a court hearing on the matter for Sept.
5. Legal fees generally are approved in bankruptcy cases.
   The attorneys representing Eastern's three striking unions _ the
pilots, Machinists and flight attendants _ are paid by the unions
and aren't required to disclose their fees to the court.
   Simon, a partner in the New York firm Cohen, Weiss &amp; Simon, said
he would ``happily accept'' only 25 percent of his adversaries' fees.
   Harvey Miller, the lead lawyer for Eastern who often has dueled
with Simon in court, put in 804 hours of work on the case at the
rate of $375 an hour, for a total of $301,650. His associate, Bruce
Zirinsky, is asking for $300 an hour for 1,156 hours of work, or
$346,890.
   Miller and Zirinsky are with Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, a New York
firm specializing in bankruptcy law which has 80 to 85 attorneys
working on the Eastern case, for fees ranging from $70 an hour to
Miller's $375. The firm's combined fee application of $3.8 million
was the largest chunk of the total filed.
   ``These are our standard billing rates,'' Miller said.
   Attorney David Boies of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, who is advising
Eastern and its parent Texas Air Corp., filed an application for
$298,000 on behalf of his firm. Lawyers for Eastern at other firms
are seeking a total of around $1.8 million.
   David I. Shapiro, the special examiner appointed by Lifland,
applied for $236,100 for 787 hours of work at $300 an hour. Fourteen
other attorneys in Shapiro's firm, Dickstein, Shapiro &amp; Morin of
Washington, D.C., asked for a total of $507,698 for 3,469 hours of
work on Eastern.
   Joel Zweibel, the principal attorney for the creditors'
committee, is seeking $241,500 for 644 hours at $375 an hour. His
firm, Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin &amp; Frankel of New York, applied
for a total of $946,106 for 36 lawyers and 13 legal assistants.
   The firms will be required to file new applications every three
months until the airline emerges from bankruptcy, a goal Eastern
hopes to achieve by the end of this year.

<HEAD>What The Numbers Tell Us</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A country is known by the numbers it keeps, and
some of those numbers of late suggest mystery, hope and a growing
health consciousness.
   These are not the usual economic numbers that relate to gross
national product and retail sales and productivity, but they
certainly have a lot to say about the present and future _ for those
who can figure them out.
   The first set of numbers, the mystery numbers, involve the
automotive industry's hopes of raising prices in spite of customer
resistance. Sales this year are likely to be lower than those of
last year, and sales next year might be lower again.
   Moreover, companies have been forced to spur sales this year with
rebates and below-market interest rates. Whenever the incentives
came off, sales came down. Without incentives, the sales decline
might have been worse.
   As matters stand, auto and light truck sales this year are likely
to fall as much as 5 percent, bringing the total to under 15
million. Few forecasters expect improvement next year; some see a
fall to 14.3 million.
   Under such conditions you might expect sellers to restrain their
pricing policies, to keep prices low in order to attract customers.
But that isn't so. General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. seem ready to raise rather than lower prices.
   Has the law of supply and demand been upset? Perhaps not, but
customers may be. Nobody likes to be confused, especially customers
contemplating one of the biggest expenses of their lifestyles. They
hardly can be blamed.
   As matters stand they find it impossible to compare one year's
prices with another year's because items that were extra one year
are standard the next, or vice versa. And even if base price is
unchanged, net price can rise sharply.
   Even if prices do rise substantially, however, it is conceivable
a customer might pay less if he or she has the patience and good
timing to obtain the best discount or rebate or below-market
interest rate. But who can say?
   It might actually be easier today to get a rough idea of the
market price of an entire auto company than just one of its cars, by
multiplying the number of shares by the per-share price listed in
the newspaper.
   The numbers are clearer, and offer more hope for Americans, in
regard to another aspect of life, the amount of time spent watching
television. The Japanese, it has been determined, watch more
television than Americans.
   The consequences of this become immediately apparent when it is
realized that the Japanese are perhaps the most formidable foreign
competitor in the American market. But can they watch TV and retain
their productive edge?
   Japanese television viewers watched an avereage of eight hours of
TV a day in 1988, according to Nielsen Media Research, a division of
Dun &amp; Bradstreet. That's one hour more than television viewers in
the United States.
   Those attempting to divine the economic future might find
significance in another Nielsen finding about Japanese culture. The
most popular programs, it says, are cartoons, followed by quiz and
audience participation programs.
   Meanwhile, Americans are changing their drinking habits, perhaps
for the better. There is a trend away from alcoholic drinks to more
natural products, and even to water, although commercial soft drink
figures are rising.
   In the past eight years, statistics from the beverage industry
and Wright Investors Service show, bottled water has been the
fastest growing commercial drink in the United States, from 2.7
gallons per capita in 1980 to 6.4 gallons in 1988.
   Meanwhile, per capita consumption of distilled spirits, powdered
drinks, beer and coffee has declined. The gainers are wine, juices
and fruit drinks, milk and soft drinks, the latter aided by the
attraction of fewer calories.
   By far the biggest percentage increase, 11.4 percent for the
eight years, was in bottled water of various sorts _ sparkling
mineral waters, flavored seltzers, spring water _ followed by soft
drinks at 3.7 percent.
   Coffee was down 1.2 percent to 25 gallons per capita in 1988.
Beer fell only slightly for the eight-year period, by just
seven-tenths of a gallon, but the decline was especially sharp in
1988 versus 1987. Tea remained flat.
   These figures might not electrify you, any more than might the
latest economic report about the gross national product.
Conceivably, though, they could provide an equal amount of insight.

   More than 190,000 telephone employees were on strike nationwide
today after workers in five Midwestern states joined the walkout.
But two other regional telephone companies reached settlements to
keep 83,000 workers on the job.
   About 35,000 members of the Communications Workers of America
went on strike Sunday against Chicago-based Ameritech, which serves
12.3 million customers in the Midwest.
   They joined more than 156,000 operators, installers and other
employees at three other ``Baby Bells'' _ NYNEX, Bell Atlantic, and
Pacific Telesis _ who entered the second week of their walkout today.
   Terry Tilden of the State Library in Harrisburg, Pa., said today
the reference desk has been receiving numerous calls from people
needing phone numbers but unable to reach directory assistance.
   ``One day last week I had the Manhattan white pages and the
Philadelphia white pages out and didn't bother reshelfing them
between calls,'' he said. ``One lady said something like trying to
get through to directory assistance was giving her heartburn.''
   In Indiana, 2,100 managers at Ameritech subsidiary Indiana Bell
braced for today's start of the work week after learning how to take
operator-assistance calls and service requests.
   ``We got through yesterday pretty good,'' spokesman Estel Gibson
said. ``Our management operators were answering calls in four to six
seconds, and we were staying current on repairs. Today's going to be
more of a challenge.''
   The regional companies already on strike have said that most
direct-dial calls were going through normally on automated
equipment. Some union jobs were filled by management employees, but
the walkouts disrupted installations and repairs, operator-assisted
calls and inquiries to directory assistance.
   There were few signs of progress in resolving any of the
disputes, which center on wages and company plans to cut back health
benefits.
   Nevertheless, the CWA reached agreement Sunday with U S West,
which serves 14 Western states, and with Southwestern Bell Telephone
Co., which has 11 million customers in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Texas and Arkansas.
   In both cases, the union accepted lower-than-hoped-for wage
increases in exchange for company agreements to maintain health
benefits more or less intact. Workers at U S West, based in the
Denver area, settled for an immediate 5 percent increase, while St.
Louis-based Southwestern Bell agreed to a 5.25 percent hike.
   The accords averted strikes by 42,000 U S West workers and 41,000
employees of Southwestern Bell.
   Union officials reached agreement Aug. 5 with the seventh
regional company, Atlanta-based BellSouth.
   In Boston, union leaders want customers to stop paying their
phone bills and are planning a rally Tuesday to draw attention to
their opposition to demands that employees pick up a larger share of
their health insurance.
   Calvey, business manager of International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers Local 2222 in Quincy, Mass., which is striking
against New England Telephone, said insurance is the major issue.
``The others you can compromise on,'' he said.
   ``If the big companies, the ones that can afford it, begin taking
a stand against paying medical benefits, the whole national health
care issue will go on the back burner,'' Calvey said. New England
Telephone is part of NYNEX.
   The Boston Herald reported today that former Democratic
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson would attend the rally to help
launch the protest.
   The seven Baby Bells were created by the 1984 breakup of American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph. Each has sought to get workers to pay a
larger share of their health insurance costs, which have soared at
twice the rate of inflation in recent years.
   In Chicago, CWA and Ameritech officials said they were willing to
talk, but neither side seemed in a hurry.
   Talks ``have not occurred in any of the states, nor do we
anticipate any occurring in the next few days,'' Ameritech spokesman
Steve Ford said Sunday. The company's subsidiaries in Illinois,
Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin were negotiating separately
with the union.
   The IBEW, which has been on strike against the three other
regional companies but settled its contract with Ameritech, was
respecting picket lines on Sunday, said Greg Kenefick, a CWA
spokesman in Cleveland. But Illinois Bell spokesman Larry Cose said
he had no indication the IBEW employees had joined the walkout.
   Talks in the Bell Atlantic dispute were scheduled to resume today
in Washington, where phone company representatives met for an hour
Sunday with union officials representing workers in Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware and the
District of Columbia.
   The strikes involve 60,000 workers at New York-based NYNEX, which
serves New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, and Connecticory     08-14 0250

   Share prices fell sharply Monday in a retreat from
its near 30 percent surge since the beginning of the year.
   Traders said the London market was also dented by Wall Street's
retreat Friday and mounting concern on the outlook for the British
economy.
   ``Trading was fairly thin and pretty calm,'' one trader said.
``It simply isn't a major setback. The market has had a good run and
this was an overdue correction.''
   The FT-SE 100 index ended down 28.3 points, or 1.2 percent, at
2325.9. The narrower Financial Times 30-share index ended down 19.3
points at 1950.3. Turnover at the close registered a moderate 434.9
million shares.
   The FT 500 index was down 15.62 at 1310.52.

   Stock prices were mixed in relatively slow
trading today with blue-chip issues showing the most strength.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 7.78 points to
2,691.77 at 2 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was down 0.95 point
at noon after a choppy morning session.

   Volume on the Big Board came to 95.08 million shares.
   Blue-chip stocks led the way in afternoon trading with the
broader market lagging behind, analysts said.
   ``We do have strength in the market today but it is a
narrow-based rally,'' said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst
for MKI Securities Corp.
   Profit-taking carried over from late Friday helped depress prices
early in the day in fairly light trading. The market crept up slowly
at mid-morning then turned flat around midday before resuming a slow
climb.
   Analysts said the market could pick up more momentum later in the
week when the government reports on housing starts, merchandise
trade and consumer prices.

   Stock prices were lower in moderate afternoon
trading today in what continued to be a choppy session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 7.02 points to
2,676.97 at 3 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 7.78 points
at 2 p.m.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by about 2 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 970 issues up, 472 down and 506 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 116.47 million shares.
   The market opened lower on profit-taking and behind a weak bond
market, then drifted up and down during the session.
   Blue-chip stocks rallied early in the afternoon but the broader
market failed to follow and the rally was soon aborted, analysts
said.
   In mid-afternoon, the bond market took a dive and stocks followed.
   ``I think this is another one of those bond squalls,'' said Gene
Jay Seagle, vice president of Gruntal Financial Inc., as stock
prices slipped by a falling bond market in the afternoon.
   On Friday, the bond market rose sharply in the morning after a
report that the producer price index declined 0.4 percent in July.
Bonds later lost more than a point after news that retail sales had
risen 0.9 percent, raising doubts that the Federal Reserve would
relax its credit policy further in the near future.
   This morning's report that business inventories rose 0.4 percent
in June was within expectations and had little impact on the stock
and bond markets.
   Analysts said the market could pick up more momentum later in the
week when the government reports on housing starts, merchandise
trade and consumer prices.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

<HEAD>Prices Drop on Forecasts of More Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed lower Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade as traders reacted to forecasts of rain
in crop-producing areas.
   Soybean prices were down sharply, after rising last week on an
Agriculture Department report projecting lower-than-expected soybean
production.
   ``All of the speculators who bought Friday were seen selling
aggressively on Monday,'' said William Biedermann, an analyst with
Allendale Inc. in Chicago. ``Rain in the forecast was the main
reason.''
   Forecasts on Friday called for dry conditions. But Monday's
forecasts called for rain in eastern crop areas early in this week,
and rain in western areas later in the week.
   ``Rain in August assures soybean producers a good crop,''
Biedermann said.
   Another factor on the soybean market is the South American
soybean crop, he said.
   Exports from South America are meeting international demand
before the U.S. harvest. Without sales from Brazil and Argentina,
the market would be tight, Biedermann said.
   Weekend rains and forecasts for more precipitation also put a
damper on corn and wheat prices.
   However, wheat futures rallied towards the close of trading, as
traders factored in Taiwan's bid for 300,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.95\ a bushel; corn was 3\
cents to 5{ cents lower with September at $2.28{ a bushel; oats were
5{ cents to 6 cents lower with September at $1.36 a bushel; soybeans
were 5 cents to 22} cents lower with August at $5.99 a bushel.

<HEAD>10.9 Percent Drop in Second-Quarter K mart Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp., faced with increased competition
from such sources as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., on Monday reported a 10.9
percent decline in its second-quarter profits.
   The company said lower-than-expected sales in May and higher
interest payments led to the drop.
   The nation's second-largest retailer behind Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
said its second-quarter profit came to $145 million, or 72 cents a
share, on revenues of $7.01 billion during the period ended July 26.
That compared with earnings of $162.8 million, or 81 cents a share,
on revenues of $6.68 billion during the same time last year.
   For the six months ended July 26, the company's profits were down
15.7 percent, falling to $239.1 million, or $1.19 a share, from
$283.6 million, or $1.41 a share, during the same time last year.
   Revenues for the period this year were $13.07 billion, up 4.4
percent from sales of $12.53 billion last year.
   ``In the first quarter we were disappointed by K mart's earnings
and we attributed it to Sears, Roebuck and the heavy promotion they
had for their new everyday pricing,'' said analyst Sally Schaadt of
Fourteen Research in New York City.
   ``This whole area (of discount retailing) has become extremely
competitive,'' she said. ``It's a tough market.''
   K mart Chairman Joseph Antonini said his company's sales in May
fell below expectations and the cost of borrowing money was higher
in the company's second quarter.
   He said things should pick up in the second half of the fiscal
year, as the company develops stronger merchandising programs and
increases the use of a company-wide computer link to monitor sales.
   K mart operated 4,135 outlets at the end of the period, including
K mart discount stores, Waldenbooks, Builders Square and Pay Less
Drug stores.

   The U.S. dollar was mixed in quiet European trading
Monday. Gold prices rose slightly.
   Foreign currency dealers said the market was positioning itself
before Tuesday's Assumption Day religious holiday, which will close
many European markets.
   Traders said confidence in the dollar remains high over the
medium term but few are willing to open big positions while the
currency ranges just below its recent highs.
   Should more traders change their minds about the dollar in the
holiday-thinned markets Tuesday, ``that could lead to some pretty
big jumps,'' said a London trader for a U.S. bank.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.83 yen to a closing 141.93 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 141.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at Monday's close compared with late Friday:
1.9395 West German marks, up from 1.9390; 1.6760 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6705; 6.5535 French francs, up from 6.5455; 2.1832 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1685; 1,393.75 Italian lire, up from 1,388.00;
and 1.1775 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1754.
   In London, the dollar gained slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.5840 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5850 late Friday.
   Gold was steady in quiet trading, with bullion dealers watching
the dollar for clues to gold's near-term direction.
   Gold closed in London at a bid price of $364 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's 362.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $363.50, up from $361.00 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 7 cents to close at a bid
$364.30 an ounce.
   Silver rose in London to $5.21 a troy ounce from Friday's 5.10.

<HEAD>Turner's Classroom News Show Debuts In Teacher Preview</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers and school administrators got their
first look Monday at Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s daily news
show for use in the classroom, a commercial-free alternative to the
sponsored news program that Whittle Communications plans to launch
next spring.
   Turner is calling its program CNN Newsroom and it will be carried
weekdays at 3:45 a.m. EDT on Cable News Network.
   The pre-dawn telecast is designed to enable teachers to tape the
program and review it to see if all or part could be used in class
later that day.
   The program was launched well before the new school year begins
to give teachers and administrators a chance to determine if it fits
with their lesson plans. Turner also gets a jump of several months
on Whittle's ad-supported Channel One news program that begins
nationally in March.
   With the notable exception of commercials, the first 15-minute
edition of CNN Newsroom resembled the 12-minute Channel One programs
that Whittle Communications tested over a seven-week period in six
schools last spring.
   Both programs are anchored by a youthful and demographically
balanced team. The CNN Newsroom anchors are Cassandra Henderson and
Brian Todd, Turner Broadcasting employees selected from a group of
more than 250 applicants.
   The programs open with news headlines, contain filmed news
footage, make liberal use of maps and carry several feature stories
chosen and developed to appeal to teenagers.
   CNN Newsroom had an expanded feature on the career of Rep. Mickey
Leland, the Texas Democrat who was killed in an airplane crash in
Ethiopia.
   It also had a feature on a Georgia high school teacher who gives
his students practical experience in using the English language by
having them research, write and edit stories for a folklore magazine
he publishes.
   And it had a feature on Chinese students who have found they must
sit through lessons taught by the army in the aftermath of the
bloody suppression of a student uprising this summer in Beijing.
   During its test run earlier this year, Channel One had features
on the life of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and series
that dealt with the environment and life in Russia for teenagers.
   The services are delivered differently.
   CNN Newsroom arrives by cable or is taped off television at home,
while Channel One is delivered by satellite.
   Atlanta-based Turner said it has endorsements or pledges of
support from cable operators representing nearly 50 percent of the
cable television hosueholds in the United States to deliver the
program to schools.
   Turner is paying the entire bill for producing the show and
providing a teacher's guide by electronic mail to help in using the
program in class.
   Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., is providing both the program
and delivery by using advertising revenue.
   Whittle said only a fraction of the nation's classrooms are
individually equipped with TV sets and that without them, teachers
are unable to make the best use possible of the daily news service
and other television programs.
   Channel One schools get an average of $50,000 in video hardware,
including TV sets, videocassette recorders and satellite dishes in
exchange for allowing Whittle to sell two minutes of commercials in
each 12-minute news program to advertisers. During the test,
companies pitched candy bars, deodorant and jeans to the
tough-to-reach teen audience.
   Several national education groups have blasted Whittle for taking
unfair advantage of students who are required to be in school and
may find it difficult to avoid the commercials.
   New York education officials have prohibited public schools in
that state from subscribing to Channel One and the top educational
officer in California has said any school in his state that takes it
risks losing state aid.
   Nonetheless, Whittle hopes to sign up 8,000 schools for Channel
One by the start of the 1990-91 school year. Turner expects teachers
in about 1,000 schools will use CNN Newsroom when school starts in
the next few weeks.

<HEAD>Thirteenth Yen Pit Trader Pleads Innocent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former trader in the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's yen futures pit on Monday became the 13th to plead
innocent to charges stemming from the federal probe of suspected
fraud in the world's largest futures markets.
   Michael Sidel, 42, of suburban Lake Forest, stood silently before
U.S. District Judge George M. Marovich as his lawyer entered the
plea.
   Sidel, accused of defrauding his customers at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, is charged with one count of violating the
Commodities Exchange Act and one count of mail fraud.
   Sidel and the other 12 former traders in the Japanese yen pit all
deny charges they took part in alleged schemes to pocket profits
from trades made for customers while passing on their own trading
losses to customers.
   Forty-six traders from the Merc and from the Chicago Board of
Trade were indicted Aug. 2 on charges ranging from pre-arranged
trading to racketeering, conspiracy and tax fraud.
   The indictments stem from a 2{-year undercover FBI investigation
into trading practices at the Merc and CBOT. The probe is continuing
and more indictments are expected this fall.
   Anthony Onesto, Sidel's attorney, said he expects former yen pit
trader Thomas Braniff to testify against his client.
   Braniff, 33, of Arlington Heights, pleaded guilty last week to
two counts of violating the exchange act and two counts of mail
fraud. He also has admitted to conspiring with an unidentified
trader on two transactions in September 1987.
   Onesto refused to speculate on what effect, if any, Braniff's
testimony might have.
   A total of 21 traders were indicted for alleged illegal
activities in the yen pit. The remaining 25 defendants traded in the
Swiss franc pits at the Merc and the soybean and U.S. Treasury bond
pits at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Federal sources have said more than 2,000 hours of tapes made by
FBI agents in the exchange pits would be used as evidence.
   Marovich said he would set a trial date for the 13 traders at a
Wednesday hearing. He said he expected to hear various motions
asking for either one trial or separate trials for all traders in
the yen pit.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Gillogly has predicted that
prosecutors will take two months to present their case against the
yen traders.

   Stock prices declined in relatively slow trading
today, as the market paused after last week's frantic activity.
   The market opened lower on profit-taking and behind a weak bond
market, crept up slowly by late morning then began a seesaw action
that lasted through the entire trading session.
   A government report that business inventories rose 0.4 percent in
June had little impact on the market. Analysts said the number was
within market expectations.
   Blue-chip stocks rallied early in the afternoon but the broader
market failed to follow and the rally was soon aborted, analysts
said.
   Analysts said the market was due for a correction after last
week's hectic pace.
   ``It's normal to expect some profit-taking in the short term,''
said Ralph J. Acampora, technical analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
``This could last several days. Once it's over we can expect people
to start buying again.''
   After peaking during Friday's session above the all-time high of
2,722.42 reached on Aug. 25, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
ended the session with its sharpest loss since late June, dropping
28.64 to 2,683.99. The market had tested the all-time high on
Thursday, closing at 2,712.63.
   Analysts said the market could pick up more momentum later in the
week when the government reports on housing starts, merchandise
trade and consumer prices.

   Drexel said it expects to pay $11.5 million overall to settle
with the states, avoid litigation and retain its ability to do
business, but some states still want to revoke the New York
investment firm's brokerage license, according to securities
regulators.
   The settlements follow months of negotiations between Drexel and
a three- member panel formed by the North American Securities
Administrators Association that yielded an unprecedented pact
governing state operations of a Wall Street firm.
   Drexel earlier this year agreed to plead guilty to six felonies
and pay $650 million to resolve fraud allegations stemming from the
government's lengthy Wall Street insider trading investigation.
   It also agreed to dozens of administrative changes and
unprecedented federal supervision in the April settlement of civil
charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Most states can revoke a firm's right to do business if it is
convicted of or admits to committing a felony. Drexel also must
settle with Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.
   ``Our objective is to retain our regulatory license in the 52
jurisdictions in which we do business,'' Drexel spokesman Steven
Anreder said. ``We're there already and we've already qualified and
we think it's proper as a good corporate citizen to do that.''
   The 10 states with which Drexel has reached agreements are
Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, Vermont and Wyoming.
   Oklahoma state securities administrator Susan Bryant, who headed
the Drexel settlement panel, said 20 other states have indicated
they expect to reach a pact under the basic agreement with some
additional provisions.
   Two or three holdout states want to revoke Drexel's license,
while settlements with the remaining jurisdictions still are
unresolved, Bryant said. She wouldn't name the holdouts.
   ``I think this approach has enabled smaller states to enter into
agreements with Drexel where they wouldn't have been able to if they
had been on their own,'' she said.
   Under the settlements, Drexel is contributing money to establish
a national foundation to promote investor education and securities
law compliance. That's an acceptable alternative to some state
securities regulators that lack fining authority or don't want to
lose the money to a general budget fund.
   ``I didn't want to structure this as a fine,'' said Ellyn Brown,
state securities commissioner in Maryland, which Drexel has agreed
to pay $200,000. ``It concerns me a little bit that the next people
in the door could say, `You sold Drexel their license _ how much for
us?' That appears to me as potentially problematic.''
   In Arkansas, Drexel is paying $100,000 even though the state has
no evidence Drexel did anything wrong there. In Oklahoma, Drexel
will pay $25,000 to reimburse fees for the securities division's
work but no fine. In Kansas, the $125,000 fine is designated for the
state's general fund.
   South Carolina is using its $150,000 to endow a chair in business
and ethics at the University of South Carolina's law school.
   Settling with the states relieves Drexel of possible litigation
by individual states and frees state regulators from having to
investigate the firm's trading activities from 1984 to 1986, when
the alleged SEC fraud occurred.
   The general pact requires Drexel's outside consultant to examine
possible state securities law violations and sets conditions on
Drexel's re-entry into the retail brokerage business, which Drexel
quit in April.
   It also requires Drexel to spread the word through newspaper
advertisements to investors who may be entitled to restitution under
the SEC settlement. Drexel has agreed to set aside $350 million for
investors and pay $300 million in fines to the government.
   Drexel faces class action lawsuits nationwide, some of which have
been consolidated in federal court in New York, by investors who
claim they were defrauded. Those who may be entitled to restitution
include people who bought stocks in 20 allegedly fraudulent
transactions cited by the SEC.

   The dollar finished higher against major foreign
currencies in brisk trading Monday, extending last week's strong
rally.
   Gold prices also rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery closed at $367.10 a troy ounce, up
$1.90 from Friday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late
bid for gold at $364.70 an ounce, up $1.20.
   Dealers said demand for the dollar held steady from Friday, when
the currency jumped to its highest levels since early summer on
speculation that U.S. interest rates won't decline any time soon.
   Interest rates soared in the credit markets Monday, with some
rates reaching a nearly two-month high.
   ``At the moment no one is focusing on lower interest rates,''
said Robert Ryan, a senior trader at Irving Trust Co.
   The dollar had fallen earlier in the month as traders expressed
concern the Federal Reserve might loosen its credit policies by
working to lower interest rates to prevent the economy from falling
into a recession.
   But economic data released on Friday suggested that inflation may
be abating while the economy continues to expand. The government
reported a moderate drop in July wholesale prices and a
higher-than-expected jump in retail sales during the same period.
   ``When the dollar came down, it came down a long way so we're
seeing a reversal going on here. Money is flowing back into the
United States,'' Irving Trust's Ryan explained.
   Lower interest rates are seen as bearish for the dollar because
it makes dollar-denominated securities, such as bonds, less
attractive to foreign investors. As foreign interest declines so
does the need to convert foreign currencies into dollars.
   Overseas, the dollar turned mixed Monday, with many traders
taking to the sidelines before Tuesday's Assumption Day religious
holiday, which will close many European markets.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.83 yen to a closing 141.93 yen. It was quoted at
141.70 yen in London, and at 141.925 yen in New York, up from 141.90
Friday.
   The dollar gained slightly against the British pound. It cost
$1.5840 for sterling in London, compared with $1.5850 late Friday.
One pound fetched $1.5770 in New York, down from $1.5820 Friday.
   Other dollar rates at Monday's close compared with late Friday,
included: 1.9485 West German marks, up from 1.9405; 1.6805 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6755; 6.5780 French francs, up from 6.5555;
1.17955 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17455; and 1,399.00 Italian
lire, from 1,395.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.9395 West
German marks, up from 1.9390; 1.6760 Swiss francs, up from 1.6705;
6.5535 French francs, up from 6.5455; 2.1832 Dutch guilders, up from
2.1685; 1.1775 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1754; and 1,393.75
Italian lire, up from 1,388.00.
   Gold was steady in Europe. Gold closed in London at a bid price
of $364 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's 362.00. In Zurich,
the bid price was $363.50, up from $361.00 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 7 cents to close at a bid
$364.30 an ounce.
   Silver prices also increased. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.195 a troy ounce from $5.192 Friday.
Silver gained in London to $5.21 a troy ounce from $5.10.

   Stocks retreated further in quiet trading Monday
from near-record levels reached last week, but brokers said the
underlying market remains strong.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 6.07 points to
finish at 2,677.92.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
986 issues down, 473 up and 532 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 142.01 million
shares, down from 197.55 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 166.84 million shares.
   The market opened lower behind a weak bond market and on
continued profit-taking after Friday's steep decline.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its sharpest
drop since late June after trading above the all-time high of
2,722.42, reached on Aug. 25, 1987. The market had tested the 1987
peak Thursday, closing at 2,712.63.
   Stock prices rose late Monday morning but quickly reversed course
again and seesawed through the remainder of the session. Blue-chip
stocks rallied early in the afternoon but the broader market failed
to keep pace and the rally was soon aborted, analysts said.
   ``The recent action is a timeout to our rally, not a topout,''
said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis. ``It just shows that sellers are not that anxious to
sell.''
   A late selloff in the bond market helped weaken stocks in the
final hour of trading.
   Wall Street analysts said the market's pause was not surprising
after recent gains and that the market continued to show an
underlying strength. Much of the weakness, they said, stemmed from a
lack of buying and some computerized selling strategies, not from
strong individual or institutional selling.
   ``The market's ability to stabilize after last week shows it has
some life to it and that upside potential is still viable,'' said
Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $15.72 billion, or 0.46
percent, in value, from Friday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.90 to 191.37.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, American Telephone and
Telegraph closed down ~ at 38{, General Electric lost } to 56|,
Hewlett Packard fell 2{ to 52} and Paramount Communications declined
1] to 59~.
   IBM rose { to 116[, Eastman Kodak advanced ] to 50] and Procter &amp;
Gamble gained 2[ to 126}.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.61 to 392.77, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index lost 1.16 to 343.06.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
2.49 to 459.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 379.00, down 1.64.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Playboy Enterprises Inc. on Monday reported losses
for the final quarter and all of fiscal 1989 due to costs of changes
in the company's cable television channel, organizational
restructuring and relocation of corporate headquarters.
   The net loss for the three months ending June 30 was $6 million,
compared to a loss of $5.1 million for the same period a year ago.
Net sales and revenues were $39.6 million for the fourth quarter,
down from $37.8 million for last year's period.
   For the entire fiscal year, Playboy reported a loss of $3.8
million, compared to a gain of $2.6 million for fiscal 1988. Revenue
for the year rose to $166.2 million from $159.8 million.
   ``While there was a cost to our actions which hurt fiscal 1989
results, we have appropriately and aggressively begun to make
investments that will grow this company into the 1990s,'' said
Christie Hefner, chairman and chief executive officer.
   On Aug. 3, the company announced it will change the marketing of
The Playboy Channel, renaming it ``Playboy at Night'' and offering
it on a pay-per-view basis. The channel has been offered on a
pay-per-night basis.
   Playboy also will be moving into new corporate headquarters in
Chicago this fall.
   The company reported that Playboy magazine had a 12 percent gain
in advertising pages and a 16 percent gain in advertising revenues
during the year.

<HEAD>Peruvian Miners' Strike Push Up Copper Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper prices surged Monday on New York's Commodities Exchange in
the wake of a miners' strike in Peru and expectations that copper
will be in short supply in coming months.
   In other markets, grain and soybean prices dropped, energy
futures were mostly lower, precious metals were up modestly, and
meat and pork futures were off.
   Copper settled 2.75 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in August at $1.2035 a pound.
   The strike in Peru had been planned for several weeks, but it was
expected that efforts by the government would prevent the walkout.
Talks broke down over the weekend, resulting in the walkout.
   ``At least two-thirds if not more of the miners are out,'' said
John Steel, an analyst with Refco Co. in New York, adding that the
walkout could have an adverse effect on supplies.
   The strike comes as copper production is already suffering due to
civilian strife in Papua, New Guinea. Also, a strike at Canada's
Highland Valley Copper Mine in British Columbia continues.
   Copper production in Chile could also be disrupted because
drought has cut power supplies, Steel said.
   Grain and soybean futures closed lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade as traders reacted to forecasts of rain in crop-producing
areas.
   Soybean prices were down sharply, after rising last week on an
Agriculture Department report projecting lower-than-expected soybean
production.
   ``All of the speculators who bought Friday were seen selling
aggressively on Monday,'' said William Biedermann, an analyst with
Allendale Inc. in Chicago. ``Rain in the forecast was the main
reason.''
   Forecasts on Friday called for dry conditions. But Monday's
forecasts called for rain in eastern crop areas early this week, and
rain in western areas later in the week.
   ``Rain in August assures soybean producers a good crop,''
Biedermann said.
   Another factor on the soybean market is the South American
soybean crop, he said.
   Exports from South America are meeting international demand
before the U.S. harvest. Without sales from Brazil and Argentina,
the market would be tight, Biedermann said.
   Wheat futures rallied towards the close of trading, as traders
factored in Taiwan's bid for 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to a { cent higher with September at
$3.97 a bushel; corn was 3\ cents to 6\ cents lower with September
at $2.27} a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 6 cents lower with
September at $1.36{ a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 20{ cents
lower with August at $6.02{ a bushel.
   Trading in precious metals was described as dull by Steel despite
the gains recorded by gold because of weakness in the dollar.
   Gold was $1.70 to $2.20 higher with August at $367.10 a troy
ounce; silver was .2 cent to .8 cent higher with August at $5.195 a
troy ounce.
   Livestock futures closed lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, as traders looked ahead to this week's Department of
Agriculture report on the number of cattle in feeding lots.
   It is expected the report will show heavier placements in feed
lots and lighter marketings than a year ago, said Tom Morgan, an
analyst with Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Pork prices were mixed, with support coming from expectations of
strong holiday demand for pork products.
   Live cattle settled .65 cent lower to .30 cent higher with August
at 74.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .25 cent
lower with August at 84.97 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower
to .22 cent higher with August at 47.07 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent to .58 cent higher with August at 25.15 cents
a pound.
   Energy futures were mixed in quiet trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``I think the market is satisfied with current prices,'' said
Robert Baker, an analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in
New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 12 cents lower to 10 cents
higher with September at $18.58 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent
to .16 cent lower with September at 50.04 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .08 cent to .63 cent lower with September at 52.09
cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Ford Explorer Truck to be Shown to Dealers Beginning This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new truck from Ford Motor Co. called the
Explorer will be shown to dealers beginning this week in advance of
its formal unveiling next spring, Ford Division General Manager
Thomas Wagner said Monday.
   The new sport-utility vehicle, which will serve as a replacement
for the Bronco II, will be offered in two- and four-door models and
will be made at the company's Louisville truck plant.
   Further details of the vehicle were unavailable, said company
spokeswoman Anne Booker. It will be described to Ford dealers
beginning Wednesday during closed meetings in Chicago.
   She declined to say if the Explorer would be made for both Ford
and Mazda dealerships, but all indications pointed to that being the
case.
   In April, Ford officials in Louisville said the company would
make trucks at that plant for Mazda dealers. Ford owns 25 percent of
Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan, the parent company for a variety of
companies in the United States.
   Production of the Bronco II will stop in mid-January and
production of the Explorer will begin the following month.
   Currently, Ford and Mazda have a manufacturing agreement
involving Mazda's plant in Flat Rock. Ford Probes and Mazda MX-6
cars are built side-by-side at that plant south of Detroit.

<HEAD>Government Wants to Reschedule IMF Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will try to
reschedule its debt to the International Monetary Fund in talks
later this month, Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli said Monday.
   Argentina virtually stopped interest payments in April 1988 on
the approximately $63 billion it owes to commercial banks and
governmental institutions like the IMF. Principal payments were
deferred in 1987.
   Total overdue payments amount to about $4.4 billion, Foreign
Minister Domingo Cavallo said last week.
   The Central Bank discloses few details about Argentina's debt,
and the total owed to the IMF is not clear. The newspaper La Nacion,
citing sources in the Economy Ministry, reported last month the
country is $620 million behind in payments owed to the IMF.
   Rapanelli met Monday with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford and discussed the program of budget austerity and
privatizations proposed by President Carlos Menem to stabilize the
economy and promote growth, the government news agency Telam
reported.
   ``There was a clear manifestation ... of the favorable attitude
of the U.S. State Department and the president that they are
supporting this stage of economic recovery,'' Rapanelli said.
   Mulford later was set to meet wtih Menem.
   Inflation in July was almost 200 percent, and unemployment has
soared in the recession that was touched off by a run on the Central
Bank's foreign exchange reserves, and a massive devaluation of the
austral.
   Menem, who was elected in May and inaugurated in July, would like
to reschedule Argentina's commercial and private debt, and arrange
new loans, including $1.5 billion from the IMF and a $350 million
bridge loan from the U.S. Treasury.

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-week-old strike at American assembly
plants along the border is threatening the growth of the industry
nationwide, plant officials said Monday. They're asking the
president of Mexico to end it.
   The 15 strike-closed plants in the border city of Reynosa want
the city's other 27 assembly operations to cease production in
sympathy, said Don King, manager of Reynosa's West Bend plant, one
of the affected companies.
   ``Some of the plants in Reynosa have been closed for three weeks
and to date we have not received any indication of support from the
(Tamaulipas) state government, except promises,'' the companies said
in a letter addressed to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Salinas was out of town Monday and did not respond immediately to
the request.
   ``We are with you in your modernization program and your fight
against corruption, but we need your action as soon as possible,''
the letter said.
   The foreign-operated assembly plants, most of them
American-owned, have been closed since July 25 over a power struggle
between two union leaders.
   Union leader Rafael Morales put up red and black strike flags on
the gates of plants whose laborers had organized under leader Abel
Hernandez.
   Morales argued that Hernandez had failed, among other things, to
get union control over the transportation of raw and finished
materials and the disposal of scrap.
   Morales also argues that Hernandez can no longer represent the
workers because Hernandez withdrew recently from the Federation of
Mexican Laborers, or CTM, said King.
   King said, however, ``Under Mexican labor law we don't have to
have a union affiliated with the CTM.''
   He said the companies contend that strike is illegal because only
workers, not a rival union, have the right to strike against a
company.
   King said labor law prohibits workers from crossing a strike
banner and American companies would not urge their employees to do
so.
   ``It concerns the safety of our workers,'' he said.
   King said the strike-closed plants are asking the rest of
Reynosa's 42 maquiladoras to lock out workers ``as a demonstration
of their support and a confirmation that they don't condone illegal
activies by the union.''
   Closing would put pressure on the Mexican government to solve the
problem, since the plants provide foreign capital and jobs and the
government does not want investors to get nervous.
   Although the state labor arbitration board already has ruled in
favor of Morales, some of the companies say they will close down
permanently unless higher authorities recognize Hernandez, King said.
   ``Tamaulipas (state) has had a history of labor instability,'' he
said.
   The plants, known as maquiladoras, take advantage of cheap
Mexican labor to assemble products in Mexico for export.
   The government has made efforts in the 1980s to woo plants to
this country because of jobs they provide and the badly needed
foreign capital they bring in.
   The industry has grown from 800 plants and 218,000 employees in
1985 to about 1,400 plants and 392,000 workers today.
   The strike, the industry's most severe in memory, ``could affect
the growth of the maquiladora industry in general, depending on how
this is resolved,'' said King.
   ``If the government is not going to support a foreign investor,
he's going to be more cautious about making an investment in this
country,'' he said.
   But James Gaffney, vice president of the Reynosa Association of
Maquiladoras, said Monday that the plants have ``no response at this
time'' to the request.
   Asked if his Calzado de Mexico plant, which makes Converse tennis
shoes, would support the strike, Gaffney said, ``I haven't talked to
our corporate people yet.''
   About 27,000 people work in the city's assembly plants. The
strike so far has locked about 2,000 people out of their jobs.
   The dispute has been in a federal court since last week, but no
decision has been made, King said.
   Officials of Invacare Corp. of Elyria, Ohio, said their Invamex
operations in Reynosa were not operating Monday but that they
expected the labor problems to be ironed out soon.
   The company, which makes wheelchairs, invested about $5 million
to start up the plant last year and was planning to expand next year.

<HEAD>Judge Upholds One Nokia Phone Patent; Knocks Down Two Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. administrative law judge has
recommended upholding a Nokia Corp. patent design of cellular mobile
telephones, but ruled against the company in two other patent
disputes brought by Motorola Inc., officials said Monday.
   Judge John J. Mathias in Washington recommended to the
International Trade Commission against Nokia on its patent for the
phone's keypad and temperature control device, said officials for
both companies.
   The Finnish telecommunications company's North American unit,
Nokia Inc., is based in Basking Ridge, N.J. The company said it
expects the trade commission to throw out the administrative law
judge's recommendation on the two component patents.
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., filed patent infringement
complaints with the ITC and in federal court in Chicago in April to
try to block the import of certain cellular telephones.
   Nokia and Tandy Corp. jointly make cellular telephones in South
Korea to be are sold under separate brand names. Tandy markets the
phones under its Radio Shack brand name and Nokia under the name
Nokia-Mobira.
   Motorola is seeking to temporarily bar Nokia and Tandy from
importing the cellular phones and, in the federal court proceeding,
is asking for unspecified monetary damages.
   ``The ruling was clearly very favorable to Motorola,'' said
Motorola spokesman Tim Kellogg.
   The ITC is to make an initial finding by Aug. 29, when the
commission would decide how large a bond the two companies must post
so they can continue selling the imported phones until a final
decision.
   The case is expected to be resolved next April.

<TEXT>
   Crude oil and heating oil futures finished mostly
lower Monday in listless trading, as the market continued in its
summer doldrums with no significant events on the horizon to
influence price movements. Gasoline futures were mixed.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September-delivery
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude, closed 10 cents higher at $18.58 per 42-gallon barrel. Most
contract months for later delivery declined, however.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded regular
gasoline for September delivery jumped 0.63 cent to 52.09 cents a
gallon. Many contracts for later delivery fell.
   Heating oil futures declined after leading the market higher last
week. The September contract slipped 0.16 cent to finish at 50.04
cents a gallon. Other contracts had smaller declines.
   Analysts said the market turned in a dull performance, with no
fresh news to influence prices. They said traders are looking
forward to Labor Day for a pickup in activity and beyond that to the
next scheduled meeting, on Sept. 23, of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``Fundamentally, there's no change in the market,'' said Linda
Simard, an oil futures analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
``Everyone's wondering when this is going to end.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack W. Schuler, Abbott Laboratories' president,
has resigned from the giant pharmaceuticals company, citing
``differences in philosophy'' with the company's chairman, officials
said Monday.
   Schuler stepped down Friday from his posts as Abbott's chief
operating officer and a member of the board, said company spokesman
Dick Hamilton. The resignation was effective immediately.
   ``There were differences in philosophy. That's it,'' Hamilton
said in a telephone interview. ``I can't elaborate.''
   Abbott Chairman Robert Schoellhorn assumed the additional post of
president for an undetermined period of time, Hamilton said.
   Schoellhorn served as the company's president and chief operating
officer from 1985 through 1987, when Schuler was named to the post.
   G. Kirk Rabb resigned as Abbott's chief operating officer in
1985, and James Vincent left the post five years earlier, said
spokeswoman Ellen Walvoord. She would not say what reasons they had
given for leaving the company.
   Schuler had been with Abbott for 17 years in various positions.
   He left Texas Instruments in 1972 to become director of sales and
marketing for Abbott's diagnostics division, and worked his way up
to executive vice president before he was made president in January
1987, Hamilton said.
   Abbott Labs is a worldwide manufacturer of health care products,
with 1988 sales of $4.9 billion. The company's worldwide
diagnostic-products sales total an estimated $500 million.
   The company in 1985 marketed the first AIDS blood screening test
to be approved by the government.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday selected White House
aide Richard C. Breeden, an attorney and banking specialist, to be
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Breeden, 39, has served in a variety of capacities under Bush,
most recently as White House point man on the savings-and-loan
restructuring legislation.
   The SEC post requires Senate confirmation.
   Breeden would succeed David S. Ruder, who has headed the
regulatory body since two months before the October 1987 stock
market crash. Ruder announced in May that he was stepping down to
accept a position at Northwestern Law School.
   Bush announced he technically would nominate Breeden to be the
numerical replacement for SEC member Charles C. Cox, whose four-year
term had expired. However, the White House said in a statement that,
upon Senate confirmation of Breeden as Cox's replacement, Bush would
immediately designate Breeden the new chairman.
   Ruder has indicated he will resign his regular SEC seat once
Breeden was confirmed, so Bush then would have to fill that vacancy,
too.
   According to the White House announcement, Breeden's experience
covers ``a wide range of securities, banking and other financial
transactions and matters, both in the United States and
internationally.''
   He is a 1972 graduate of Stanford University and a 1975 graduate
of the Harvard Law School. From 1981 to 1982, Breeden was an
executive assistant to the under secretary of labor.
   In advance of the formal announcement, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater called Breeden ``an outstanding
candidate.''
   Breeden helped draft the administration's initial plan for
bailing out the nation's ailing savings and loan industry, submitted
in February. He also represented the White House in dealings with
Congress as that legislation progressed.
   The final plan, a sweeping rewriting of banking laws and the
largest single-industry government bailout ever, was signed into law
by Bush last week at a Rose Garden ceremony attended by Breeden.
   Breeden, whose current job as presidential assistant for issues
analysis made him something of a White House troubleshooter, also
helped fashion administration policy for dealing with the Alaska oil
spill.
   From 1982 to 1985 Breeden was deputy counsel to then-Vice
President Bush.
   He was a banking specialist with a New York law firm before that,
and between government assignments worked in the Washington office
of a Houston law firm.
   He was also the director of a task force on deregulation headed
by Bush as vice president, and wrote the panel's report on the
deregulation of financial services.
   The SEC is a five-member board that oversees securities markets,
regulates the sale of stocks, bonds and stock options and enforces
securities laws.
   Ruder, an appointee of former President Reagan, has been chairman
since Aug. 7, 1987.
   He announced last May that he wanted to return to Northwestern,
where he once taught, but would stay on until a successor was
selected.
   Breeden's nomination was not expected to run into any
difficulties in the Senate.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 9-10, `In May ... instant photography,' to CORRECT

<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. Chairman Colby Chandler testified
Monday he knew getting into instant photography could mean a lawsuit
from competitor Polaroid Corp. but sid he was convinced his company
would win.
   Chandler was called to testify in a U.S. District Court trial to
determine how many dollars in damages his company will have to pay
Polaroid. An earlier federal court decision established that Kodak
infringed on patents of Polaroid, the Cambridge, Mass.-based pioneer
of instant photography.
   Polaroid is seeking $12 billion, which would be a record award in
a patent infringement suit, while Kodak has argued it should pay
$177 million, an amount equal to a royalty of 5 percent on the
cameras and film it sold from 1976 to 1985.
   Chandler answered ``yes'' when asked if he had felt there was a
chance Kodak's introduction of an instant camera in the mid-1970s
could provoke a suit from Polaroid.
   But he said, ``I felt we had reduced the risk to such a low level
it was not a major consideration.''
   Chandler, who is chief executive as well as chairman of
Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak, testified before Judge A. David Mazzone
that Kodak's corporate policies clearly state, ``We will not
knowingly violate or infringe'' on another company's patents.
   Asked if he had any reason to believe that policy was violated
when Kodak entered the instant film business, Chandler said, ``No, I
did not.''
   Chandler said he relied on advice from the company's patent
attorneys in deciding that Kodak's product would not infringe on
Polaroid's patents.
   In May, Polaroid Chairman William J. McCune Jr. testfied that
Polaroid and Eastman Kodak had a productive working relationship for
decades, with Kodak making film for Polaroid, but that things soured
in the late 1960s when Polaroid introduced its SX-70 camera.
   Kodak, McCune said, was asked to produce the new, complex
negative that Polaroid had developed for that instant color camera.
But he said Kodak demanded a license from Polaroid, which would have
allowed Kodak to develop its own instant photography.
   Polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities
in Massachusetts.
   McCune testified then that instant photography is Polaroid's
``bread and butter'' and that Kodak's introduction of instant film
and cameras cut deeply into his company's profits.

<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Upjohn Co. said Monday it is launching an
aggressive new ad campaign for its hair loss treatment now that the
federal government has banned all other would-be competitors.
   On Wednesday, the Kalamazoo-based pharmaceutical company will
unveil full- and half-page print advertisements in 29 newspapers
that will represent one of the few times the name of a prescription
drug has appeared in consumer-directed ads.
   The new ad features a clip of a New York Times story about the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration's ruling against non-prescription
products that claim to promote hair growth or prevent hair loss.
   The headline for the ad reads: ``The good news is there's one
product that's proven to grow hair ... Rogaine.''
   The ads also will appear in many national magazines beginning
next week.
   On July 7, the FDA said that none of the manufacturers of the
dozens of non-prescription creams and lotions on the market has
shown that any of those products work.
   When the ban goes into effect in January, manufacturers of any
non-prescription drugs claiming to prevent baldness or grow hair
will have to provide proof that it is safe and effective before it
can be put on the market.
   The agency will remove the products from the market on a
case-by-case basis if their distributors continue to make such
claims without proof.
   Upjohn estimates American men spend more than $200 million each
year on such unproven hair-loss products.
   Rogaine, a 2 percent minoxidil solution, is the only FDA-approved
hair loss treatment. It has been on the market since last September.
   ``What this does is enable us to more directly refer to Rogaine,
and, at the same time, use the FDA ruling to differentiate Rogaine
from all the other would-be treatments,'' Upjohn spokesman T.R. Reid
said.
   Financial analysts, who have been disappointed with Rogaine
sales, have blamed part of the product's lackluster performance on
ambiguous advertising. In the past, Upjohn hasn't used the name of
the product in its ads because the FDA requires full disclosure of
possible side effects.
   The ads have used only the company name and advised balding men
to see their doctors if they are concerned about hair loss.
   The latest ads list the product's possible side effects, such as
itching of the scalp, as well as its effectiveness. The topical
solution has been shown in testing to grow hair in about 39 percent
of young men who are in the early stages of balding.
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration rules prohibit companies from
advertising brand names of prescription drugs unless the ads also
list possible side effects and any warnings about use of the drug.
   The ads, which feature a toll-free number for more information,
also offers a $10 certificate ``as an incentive to visit your
doctor.''
   The drug costs about $60 for a one-month supply.
   The ads also say that 2 million men have tried Rogaine. Upjohn,
which doesn't release sales of individual products, said the
product's performance continues to climb.

   A union official Monday blasted a proposal by one of four
strikebound regional telephone companies, while a company car
belonging to another ``Baby Bell'' was burned and a man was
critically injured in a picket line accident.
   Nearly 200,000 operators, clerks, installers and other workers
stayed off the job in 20 states and the District of Columbia.
Strikes began the weekend of Aug. 5-6 at New York-based NYNEX,
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic and San Francisco-based Pacific
Telesis. On Sunday, workers at Chicago-based Ameritech joined them.
   Workers at the other three so-called Baby Bell companies have
reached tentative settlements with the two big telephone unions, the
Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers.
   They are Atlanta-based BellSouth, which settled Aug. 5, and
Denver-based US West and St. Louis based Southwestern Bell, which
both reached settlements Sunday.
   Officials at the four struck companies said customers were
experiencing some delays in directory assistance, operator-assisted
calls and repair services, but management employees were being
trained to take up part of the slack.
   ``Four thousand people can't do the job of 12,800, but they're
doing the best they can,'' said Eileen Dixon, a spokeswoman for
Michigan Bell, an Ameritech subsidiary.
   Libraries have reported a high demand from people wanting
telephone numbers but unable to reach a directory assistance
operator.
   ``One day last week I had the Manhattan white pages and the
Philadelphia white pages out and didn't bother reshelfing them
between calls,'' Terry Tilden of the State Library in Harrisburg,
Pa., said Monday.
   Representatives of Bell Atlantic and striking workers met for
about an hour Monday afternoon, and the company presented a revised
proposal, said Kenneth Pitt, a company spokesman. The company was
awaiting a union response, he said.
   ``We've been making progress, obviously,'' Pitt said. ``We'd like
our people back and every day we hope it's the last day of the
strike.''
   But CWA spokesman Jim Willer said the company's health-insurance
proposal was ``unacceptable.'' According to Willer, the company
continued to demand that workers pay deductibles in addition to half
the premiums for relatives other than spouses and children. The
union refuses to pay any deductibles or premiums.
   Willer said the company agreed to give an advisory committee on
health benefits more power, but said, ``This obvious superficial
attempt to settle the contract is yet another in a long list of
insults.''
   The issue of who pays for health insurance has been a key issue
in several of the negotiations, as management has tried to shift
some of the costs onto the workers.
   A spokesman for Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of Pacific Telesis,
said talks were planned later in the day. But no talks were
scheduled at NYNEX or at the strikebound subsidiaries of Ameritech.
   In the East, there were several incidents of trouble linked or
possibly linked to the strike:
   _ A NYNEX picket, Edward G. Horgan, 34, was hospitalized in
critical condition after he fell off a car that had brushed him on a
picket line in the New York suburb of Mount Pleasant, police said.
   Police Chief Paul Oliva said that an 18-year-old NYNEX employee
was driving on the service road of a NYNEX facility when her car
brushed Horgan, after he and several other pickets gathered around
her car and yelled at her.
   Horgan mounted the hood of the slowly moving car and pounded on
the windshield, but slid off and hit his head on the pavement,
according to the police account. The union disputed that, saying he
fell onto the hood when the young woman accelerated. No charges were
filed.
   New York Telephone Co. President Fred Salerno appealed for calm
after the accident and said he had asked the union to resume
negotiations ``to try and calm the waters.''
   _ In Elmont, N.Y., police said a NYNEX car was burned shortly
after midnight in a company parking lot. The fire, which police
described as suspicious, also caused minor damage to a building
nearby.
   _ Most of West Virginia was without long distance service for
about eight hours beginning late Sunday when an aerial cable was
damaged. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone spokeswoman Roberta Fowlkes
said vandalism couldn't be ruled out as the cause of the outage,
which affected 600,000 customers. Lines also were damaged in the
Sissonville area, affecting local service.
   Scattered incidents of strike-related vandalism were reported
last week, including several incidents of damaged lines in New
Jersey. Peter Ventimiglia, a spokesman for New Jersey Bell, said
Monday that the company had counted more than 175 incidents of
vandalism or sabotage last week, but no new incidents had been
reported Sunday night or Monday morning.
   The ``Baby Bell'' companies were formed in 1984 by the
court-ordered breakup of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. AT&amp;T
reached union contracts earlier this year and was not directly
affected by the strike.
   The Ameritech walkout affected 35,000 CWA members and 12.3
million customers in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and
Wisconsin. Ameritech subsidiaries also employ 13,500 IBEW members,
most of them in Illinois. That union advised members to follow their
own consciences when deciding whether to work or honor CWA picket
lines; it appeared Monday that most were going to work.
   Pacific Telesis has 42,000 CWA members and 2,500 IBEW members on
strike. It sewrves northern Nevada and all of California.
   Bell Atlantic has 41,000 CWA workers and 11,500 IBEW members and
provides service in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
   NYNEX has 40,000 CWA workers and 20,000 IBEW members and provides
service in all or part of New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Connecticut.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Higher, Share Prices Rise Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar traded higher against the Japanese
yen Tuesday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
rose marginally as many participants took summer holidays.
   The dollar opened at 142.40 yen, up 0.47 yen from Monday's close
of 141.93 yen, the ending rate in New York also.
   Its higher start followed a similar uptrend on overseas markets,
traders said.
   Minori Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said early
dealing was initiated by Japanese commercial banks, which were
mainly buying the dollar.
   ``There was little dollar-selling incentive now in the market, so
the dollar was getting stronger against other currencies, too,'' she
said.
   The dollar's upswing began when the U.S. jobless rate was
released two weeks ago and the nation's unemployment rate fell by
0.1 percent in July.
   Market players were further reassured about the steady growth in
the U.S. economy by a 0.4 percent decline in the producer price
index and a 0.9 percent rise in the retail price index for July,
both released Friday in Washington.
   ``The dollar was moving little after the opening, and partcipants
are not energetic enough to push the currency over the 143-yen
mark,'' Ms. Takeuchi said, adding that trading was thin because many
investors are on summer vacations this week.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues grew by 3.03
points, or 0.01 percent, to reach 34,674.65 within the first 15
minutes of morning trading.
   Dealers said trading was inactive also due to summer holidays.

<HEAD>EPA Calls For Less Sulfur In Diesel Fuel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday
said it plans to lower sulfur concentrations in diesel fuel to curb
motor vehicle exhaust pollution and improve air quality in urban
areas.
   Under the EPA proposal, which still must be adopted as a formal
agency regulation, refiners would be required to reduce the maximum
permitted sulfur content of diesel fuel by 80 percent before October
1993.
   Diesel engines are one of the major sources of particulate
pollution, or smoke and soot, from motor vehicles in urban areas,
especially in major cities in the West. Sulfur compounds contribute
to the problem, forming fine acidic mists that can worsen breathing
problems and contribute to acid rain.
   ``Heavy-duty diesel engines are a major source of particulate
emissions, including the smaller, fine particles that are of
greatest concern in protecting public health,'' said EPA
Administrator William K. Reilly in a statement announcing the
proposal.
   The EPA proposal would call for the same reduction in sulfur
content in diesel fuel by 1993, from 0.25 percent by weight to 0.05
percent, as recently called for by state officials in California.
   The California requirement also calls for changes in the fuel to
reduce the level of certain pollution-promoting chemicals, called
aromatic compounds. EPA's proposal would cap concentrations at the
current level instead of reducing them.
   Bob Yuhnke, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund in
Denver, said the EPA is taking the right step in calling for
reductions in sulfur, but he criticized the agency for not also
proposing reductions in the aromatic chemicals.
   ``Going only half way leaves the states holding the bag,'' Yuhnke
said. Without additional curbs on diesel fuel emissions, some states
may have trouble meeting urban air quality requirements expected in
clean air legislation now being debated in Congress, he said.
