<HEAD>Judge: No Crime in Police Shooting of Window Washer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled that a policeman committed no crime
when he shot a street car-window washer to death last August, but he
said the officer abused his authority and failed to control himself.
   County Judge Morton Perry cleared Officer Efrain Grillo after a
two-day fact-finding inquest used in investigations of police
officers.
   ``I am on the record here and now as saying this officer used
poor judgment,'' Perry said. ``If there are many more like him
around, I'd be very concerned.''
   Grillo is currently relieved of duty for allegedly fondling a
prostitute in September in an unrelated incident.
   On Thursday, Perry said there was insufficient evidence to
disprove Grillo's account of the shooting of Larry Davis, a homeless
man who earned small change by washing car windows in traffic.
   Grillo, who had arrested Davis earlier in the day but found him
back at the same window-washing spot later, said the two argued and
Davis lunged at him with a knife.
   One witness, Turner Williams, who also washes windows, claimed
the knife belonged to Grillo, not Davis.

<HEAD>59 Wiring and Plumbing Problems in Boeing Jets Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has received
59 reports of miswiring or faulty plumbing in cargo-hold and engine
fire-suppression systems of Boeing commercial jets since 1981,
officials said.
   FAA officials said 32 of the problems were found by airlines
between March 1988 and Jan. 31, when the agency issued an
airworthiness directive ordering checks of all Boeing aircraft built
since Dec. 31, 1980, and flown by U.S. operators, covering 741
planes in all.
   The other 27 problems have been found since Jan. 31, the latest
on Thursday.
   None of the discrepancies directly affected the airworthiness of
the aircraft, the FAA said in a news release Friday, but the agency
said flight crews could have been misled into taking the wrong
action during an inflight engine or cargo compartment fire.
   All of the problems were corrected before the planes were
returned to service, the FAA said.
   Of the 27 problems found since the Jan. 31 order, six were on
U.S. aircraft and 21 on foreign planes.
   Eleven of the problems were in engine fire warning and
suppression systems: five on 737-300s and 737-400s, three in 767s,
two in 757s and one in a 747. Sixteen problems were found in cargo
compartment fire warning and suppression systems, 13 in 747s and
three in 767s.
   Boeing Co. said it is redesigning some parts and overhauling test
procedures to try to prevent future errors.
   Meanwhile, a letter dated Jan. 26 from Leroy Keith, local manager
of the FAA's Aircraft Certification Service, to Boeing officials
renewed concerns about delays in reporting safety problems to the
federal agency, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported Friday.
   Boeing learned of crossed wires in a 757 cargo fire-suppression
system last August but reported the problem four months later, Keith
noted.
   ``Until now, I had been encouraged that there were definite
improvements,'' his letter said. ``The 757 issue, however, indicates
that more needs to be done.''

<HEAD>Disputed Carving in Hair Gets Student Suspended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother of an elementary school pupil has
ruled out the barbershop for her son even though he was suspended
because of what school officials contend is a martini glass design
shaved on his scalp.
   The school principal said Thursday the hair design, which the
mother contends is an hourglass, encourages alcohol abuse.
   ``My son has missed three weeks of school because of a haircut,''
said Debra Muhammad, whose 11-year-old son, Isaiah, attends Robert
E. Lee Elementary School. ``I've never heard of anything like this
in my life. I could see if he was a troublemaker. But for a
haircut?''
   Mrs. Muhammad said Isaiah's older brother has the same hourglass
design carved in his hair.
   Principal Gregory Muzik said all the youngster has to do to get
reinstated is get a haircut. ``I'm not saying the child is out of
school forever,'' he said. ``There has to be some willingness to
cooperate.''
   Hair carvings have become popular among students, Muzik said.
Most designs depict the name of sports heroes or somebody's initials
and are no problem. But any design that seems to encourage drug or
alcohol abuse or Satanism is prohibited, the principal said.
   Only one other Lee pupil has run afoul of the rule, Muzik said,
and that boy's parents promptly took him to a barbershop. But Mrs.
Muhammad said a haircut for Isaiah is out of the question.
   ``It's the principle,'' she said. ``Other kids have the same
haircut, but he has been singled out.''
   Isaiah was suspended under the Richmond school division's
standards of student conduct, which give principals wide latitude in
enforcing rules on appearance, Muzik said. It bars students from
immodest, unhealthful or distracting appearance.
   Muzik conceded the design in the boy's hair could be subject to
interpretation and said it is unlikely an 11-year-old even knows
what a martini is. But in his view, and that of two teachers at the
school, it is a martini glass.
   ``It's clearly alcohol-related,'' Muzik said. ``A strong stand
has to be taken. It's a significant enough problem.''

   Petty crime in the Brussels subway has
increased 26-fold in the 1980s, but the Metro remains among the
safest subway systems in the world, transit authorities say.
   Thefts of purses, money and jewelry in the trains and in the
subway's 57 stations surged to over 800 cases last year from 30 in
1980. These and other petty crimes were 26.6 times as high last year
as in 1980.
   But officials said Friday that no murder or rape has ever been
committed in the subway system, which is used by 650,000 people each
day.
   Subway vandalism also was reported on the rise. In 1988, the
subway system spent $100,000 repairing damage by graffiti writers
and vandals.

   An oil-refinery tank caught fire during

fumes enveloped the area, police reported.
   They said there were no casualties from Friday's blaze at the
state-owned refinery in Sapugaskande, 10 miles north of Colombo, and
the fire apparently was caused by lightning.
   ``People began running from their homes near the refinery fearing
the fire would spread to the other 24 tanks'' in the refinery, a
police official said.
   The tanks set afire contained naphtha and rain helped firemen
bring the blaze under control within two hours, according to the
police.

   Two women and a man armed
with pistols entered a branch of the Bank of Spain in this
northwestern city and killed two Civil Guards, police reported.
   They said the killers fled without taking any money.
   Friday's attack was blamed by police on terrorists of the
left-wing GRAPO organization, but no individual or group asserted
responsibility.
   GRAPO is a Spanish acronym for the 1st of October Revolutionary
Anti-Fascist Group.
   The organization became inactive in the early 1980s after scores
of terrorist assaults but on Oct. 4 two women and a man shot to
death a policeman stationed at a government office in Madrid and
GRAPO claimed responsibility.

<HEAD>Foreigners Describe `Warlike' Scene; Martial Law Keeps Tibetans Off
Streets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's tight military lock on the Tibetan capital
of Lhasa kept Tibetans off the streets and thwarted demonstrations
on the 30th anniversary of an unsuccessful anti-Chinese uprising.
   Chinese television said Friday that the martial law crackdown in
the Himalayan city had stopped a plot to stage a riot.
   The official China News Service said a convoy of 72 vehicles and
more than 1,200 troops drove through Lhasa on Friday in a massive
show of force. The report said the patrol included 10 vehicles with
automatic rocket guns.
   Authorities declared martial law Tuesday after three days of
bloody separatist rioting. More protests had been expected Friday,
the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.
   China's official media said calm had returned to the city of
70,000 and quoted Lhasa residents as expressing gratitude for the
military intervention.
   The Xinhua News Agency quoted a Tibetan scholar as saying
Tibetans have a ``deep hatred'' for the rioters. It depicted
Tibetans offering water, straw mattresses, tea and shelter to
Chinese troops.
   Tibetans contacted by telephone, however, spoke of police
roundups and a climate of fear. They spoke of heavy military
presence on the streets and said they had been told to remain
indoors.
   One woman said large-scale arrests began after most foreigners
left the city Thursday. The nightly news Friday said more than 30
``rioters'' had surrendered to police.
   Foreign tourists were told to leave Lhasa when martial law was
declared. Two British journalists who entered Lhasa as tourists
during the riots were subjected to interrogations and fined.
   A New York man and four Swedes reached Katmandu, Nepal, from
Lhasa on Friday. They left the Tibetan capital Tuesday in a
four-wheel drive, rough terrain vehicle and had to trek through snow
part of the way.
   ``I feel very lucky to get my passport back from the Chinese and
make my journey safely to Katmandu,'' said New Yorker Russell
Liebman, 22.
   Liebman said on Sunday, ``we went to the roof of a house and saw
the beginning of the demonstration. We took lots of photographs. We
noticed some policemen were standing on the roof of another nearby
house. We heard shots.''
   Policemen later stopped them at their hotel and took their film
and their passports, they reported.
   ``We heard shots,'' said one of the Swedes, who identified
himself only as Pontus. ``The shots fired by the soldiers. When I
looked out from the window you can see a warlike scene. Once in a
while dead body being carried in pushcart.''
   China says the protests left 16 people dead and more than 100
hurt. Western travelers say most Tibetans place the death toll at
between 20 and 30, with some estimates much higher.
   During the rioting, mobs of stone-throwing Tibetans ransacked
Chinese-owned shops, set fire to Chinese property and attacked
government office buildings. They demanded independence from China
and expressed loyalty to the Dalai Lama.
   The March 10 anniversary marks a failed uprising when tens of
thousands of converged on the Dalai Lama's palace to prevent what
they thought was a Chinese military attempt to kidnap him.
   A week later, the Chinese allegedly fired two mortar shells into
the palace grounds, and the Dalai Lama and his family fled secretly
to India. The Chinese army moved in to destroy the Tibetan
resistance, killing at least hundreds.

<HEAD>Rodriguez Accepts Presidential Nomination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who seized power
in a coup that ousted President Alfredo Stroessner, says he has
agreed to be the presidential nominee of the governing Colorado
Party.
   The elections are set for May 1.
   ``At no moment was I inspired by inferior motives or a hunger for
power,'' Rodriguez said Friday. ``My decision was inspired only in
the happiness of my country and the well-being of all my fellow
citizens.''
   Rodriguez said that if elected, he will work within an
``exemplary multiparty system'' to carry out constitutional reforms
that would give Paraguay ``a respected image.''
   Opposition politicians have called for elimination of a clause in
the constitution that allows a president to continually seek
re-election.
   They also want anulled a 1970 criminal law called the ``defense
of public peace'' that was widely used under Stroessner to harass
dissidents for allegedly doing such things as ``inspiring class
hatred'' among Paraguayans.
   ``The nomination was no surprise,'' said Domingo Laino, president
of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, Paraguay's largest
opposition group.
   ``Since the 1940s, the Colorado Party has been nominating
generals for the presidency. They seem unable to separate themselves
from men in uniform.''
   Rodriguez, a 65-year-old cavalry general, organized the Feb. 3
coup that ended Stroessner's 34 years in power.
   Meanwhile, former Interior Minister Sabino Augusto Montanaro left
Paraguay for political asylum in Honduras. Montanaro, 66, was given
refuge in the Honduran Embassy in Asuncion the day of the coup. A
telephoned bomb threat delayed his flight for two hours on Friday.
   Montanaro was one of Stroessner's most trusted aides and
president of the Colorado Party.
   He was one of five ministers and seven high government and party
officials accused of ``crimes against public administration'' after
the coup.

<HEAD>McFarlane Denies Knowing Many Actions of Subordinate North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane says he was unaware of many of Oliver North's activities
for the Contras but thought the efforts of a single military officer
would be ``inconsequential.''
   Testifying Friday in North's trial on charges stemming from the
Iran-Contra affair, McFarlane said he didn't know how his former
aide had become involved in private fund-raising for the Contras or
was determining how private contributions were being spent.
   McFarlane also said he hadn't known that North had used a public
relations consultant to get a quick $30,000 donation for the Contras.
   Earlier, McFarlane said former President Reagan knew in 1984 that
arrangements had been made to get $1 million a month from Saudi
Arabia for the the U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua.
   And Reagan said ``we'll all be hanging by our thumbs'' if word
got out that McFarlane or other administration officials were
seeking help from abroad at a time that Congress had forbidden
direct U.S. aid to the Contras, according to minutes of the 1984
meeting read into the court record.
   Despite a series of memos from North to McFarlane between
December 1984 and May 1985, McFarlane said he didn't know specifics
of North's activities such as his help in directing the Contras in
opening of another front in Nicaragua.
   ``I had been in the military for 20 years and I knew the
activities of a single officer in setting up a Southern Front was
inconsequential,'' said McFarlane, like North a former Marine. ``It
didn't occur to me that North ... could set up a Southern Front.''
   In the late summer and fall of 1985, two congressional panels
began asking about news reports of North's involvement with the
Contras. Four of North's 12 criminal charges say he prepared
responses for McFarlane's signature essentially denying that North
was doing anything for the guerrilla force.
   McFarlane has pleaded guilty to four charges of withholding
information from Congress and was sentenced last week to two years'
probation, 200 hours of community service and fines of $20,000.
   A March 5, 1985, memo from North to McFarlane says Guatemala
should get extra U.S. aid because Guatemalan officials supplied
phony certificates that permitted a clandestine arms shipment to go
to the Contras.
   ``I didn't even look at the certificates at the time,'' said
McFarlane, saying they were ``one of 10,000 documents'' that crossed
his desk.
   McFarlane said that ``there was a relation'' between the
certificates and the suggestion for additional aid, although the
extra aid ``stood on the merits.'' But the ``fact they helped the
freedom fighters certainly didn't disqualify them'' from getting
additional assistance, McFarlane said.
   The request for extra aid went to top Cabinet officials and the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff without mentioning that phony
end-user certificates had been provided.
   The end-user certificates state that a country, such as
Guatemala, is the ultimate destination of arms.
   A March 16, 1985, memo suggests having a tax-exempt charitable
organization collect private donations that would be used to aid the
Contras, a move that would be illegal.
   McFarlane acknowledged that a tax-exempt organization cannot
raise money for military items for use in a foreign country, but
said that even ``the president suggested that a time or two.''
   In response to a Dec. 4, 1984, memo from North, McFarlane refused
to authorize having the U.S. government let the government of Taiwan
know that the United States supported that nation making a
contribution to the Contras.
   ``I thought the problem ... was our seeking military help from
another country,'' McFarlane testified.
   North is accused of lying during congressional and presidential
inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair.

<HEAD>Survey: 1988 Was Bad Year for Smog in 31 Cities and Rural Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen areas of the country registered their
highest readings of ozone smog this decade in 1988, according to a
survey by a private research group.
   Another 15 areas _ cities and rural locations _ had their highest
ozone smog readings of the past five years, said the study released
Friday by th U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
   The organization is a self-styled, national non-partisan research
and lobbying group on consumer and environmental issues, financed by
citizen contributions.
   In another indication of worsening air across the country, the
report found that smog levels in 32 cities exceeded federal safety
limits 10 or more days last year.
   Thirteen of the 32 cities had 20 or more days of extremely
unhealthy air by exceeding the federal limits.
   ``Today, 19 years after Congress set the national goal of safe,
healthy air quality, we are faced with a situation in which an
estimated 96 areas, in which 150 million people live, are too
polluted to meet one or more of the air quality standards,'' the
report said.
   The report used state government information to collect data on
ozone in 67 areas _ cities or rural areas _ and data on carbon
monoxide from 21 areas. Significant amounts of either gas results in
unhealthy air.
   Ozone, the primary component of smog, is a gas formed when two
other pollutants, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, combine in the
presence of sunlight. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless and
poisonous gas produced by incomplete combustion of carbon.
   In looking back to 1980 the study found that in 31 areas surveyed
``the peak level of ozone smog in 1988 was higher than it had been
in five years.''
   In 16 of those areas, ``the peak level of the ozone smog in 1988
was higher than it had been in any year of the decade,'' the report
said.
   The study noted an improvement in carbon monoxide. In 1983, the
study found, at least 10 cities exceeded the federal safety limit
five or more days. In 1987, however, only six cities were in that
category.
   The report said the air can be made cleaner with tighter auto
tailpipe standards, mandatory cleanup steps for cities and severe
pollution penalties for areas that do not meet air quality standards.
   Here are the 31 areas that encountered their highest readings in
at least five years, with a 10 denoting a 10-year high:
   Illinois_Chicago 10; Maine_Gardiner 10, Acadia National Park,

<HEAD>US Revises Plan for Third World Debt Stresses Voluntary Efforts</HEAD>

   The Bush administration has shifted gears and
put forward a new plan to deal with Latin America's debt crisis _
one that envisions major reductions in the billion-dollar debt
burden.
   The proposal, unveiled Friday by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady before an audience of international bankers, members of
Congress and leaders of international lending institutions, is
getting generally positive reviews.
   Brady called for a ``great cooperative effort'' among all nations
to solve the 7-year-old crisis.
   ``Our objective is to rekindle the hope of the people and leaders
of debtor nations that their sacrifices will lead to greater
prosperity in the present and the prospect of a future unclouded by
the burden of debt,'' Brady said.
   The plan marks a shift from Reagan administration policy under
the so-called ``Baker Plan,'' which opposed writing off the
obligations of the debtor nations. The plan, devised in 1985 by
then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, now secretary of State,
suggested a voluntary increase in loans by the commercial banks in
return for basic economic reforms by the debtor nations.
   Instead, the new proposal endorses voluntary efforts on the part
of commercial banks to forgive part of the $400 billion they are
owed by the largest debtor countries, such as Mexico, Venezuela and
Brazil.
   And to encourage the banks to forgive portions of the debt, the
administration is calling on the 151-nation World Bank and its
sister organization, the International Monetary Fund, to help
provide guarantees for the remaining debt owed by the poor countries.
   A frequent critic of the Reagan policy, Sen. Bill Bradley,
D.-N.J., termed the new proposal ``a significant change of
direction.''
   He warned, however, that it would have no chance of success
unless the administration created a special post of ``debt
ambassador.''
   Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, praised Brady's
initiative as ``timely and welcome.''
   Camdessus said he looked forward to working with Brady to
implement the plan, and urged other countries to give it ``a
positive response.''
   ``The secretary is correct to emphasize the importance of
continued economic reforms in the debtor countries'' and the need
for further loans to the Third World and a reduction in their debt,
Camdessus said.
   He said banks should be more flexible in their treatment of the
problem.
   Foreign reaction was also generally favorable, with Japanese
Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama telling reporters in Japan that the
his government welcomed the Bush initiative and pledged an
unspecified amount of financial backing.
   The United States is counting on Japan to recycle a portion of
its huge trade surpluses into support for Third World countries.
   President Bush had asked Brady to review the former
administration's debt policy.
   Last week's riots in Venezuela, one of the most politically
stable democracies in Latin America, added some urgency to the
review.
   More than 300 people were killed in disturbances that erupted
after the government announced new austerity measures aimed at
satisfying international creditors.
   The Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. estimates that the foreign debt of
the 15 principal borrowers, including 10 Latin American countries,
rose to $505 billion last year, with interest the countries had to
pay totaling $42 billion.
   The debt owed by all Third World countries totaled $1.32 trillion
at the end of 1988, up from $800 billion in 1982, the year the debt
crisis first erupted with the announcement by Mexico that it could
not meet its obligations.
   The largest debtor country is Brazil, with $110 billion owed,
followed by Mexico with $107 billion owed. Other big debtors are
Argentina, $50 billion, and Venezuela, $33 billion.

<HEAD>DC Delegate Could be Investigated by Independent Counsel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   District of Columbia Delegate Walter Fauntroy
could become the first congressman investigated by a special
prosecutor if Attorney General Dick Thornburgh approves.
   The Justice Department's criminal division on Friday asked
Thornburgh to appoint an independent counsel to investigate a
possible payroll-padding scheme involving Fauntroy, the district's
non-voting delegate to the House.
   The request came after a three-month FBI investigation into
allegations that Thomas John Savage, the son of Rep. Gus Savage,
D-Ill., did little or no work in fellow Democrat Fauntroy's office.
   David Runkel, a spokesman for Thornburgh, said the request had
been submitted but the attorney general had not yet reviewed the
report. Runkel added that he did not know when Thornburgh would
decide on the case.
   The appointment would be authorized under an order issued last
August by then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, setting up the
procedure to deal with charges of wrongdoing against members of
Congress. Officials of the executive branch of the federal
government can be subject to investigation by special prosecutors
under a separate law, and Meese himself was twice investigated by
independent counsels.
   In the Fauntroy case, Savage earned $21,398 while on Fauntroy's
payroll between September 1987 and June 1988. During that time, the
younger Savage also swore in notarized Illinois election documents
that he was living full time in Chicago, where he was running for a
state House of Representatives seat.
   Several law enforcement officials said that the focus of the
investigation is possible violations of federal fraud laws.
   Sources familiar with the investigation and speaking on condition
of anonymity told The Associated Press that Fauntroy and his staff
have refused to cooperate with the FBI.
   ``We have concluded that there has to be an independent
prosecutor simply because there are a number of unanswered questions
out there and we have individuals who won't talk,'' said a Justice
Department source.
   An independent prosecutor would have the power to subpoena
Fauntroy and his staff to testify before a grand jury about the
younger Savage's whereabouts. FBI agents conducting the preliminary
investigation said they did not have the authority to ask for such
subpoenas.
   Fauntroy said through a spokeswoman that he had not learned of
the Justice Department's action, while Rep. Savage did not return
repeated phone calls to his Capitol Hill office. Thomas Savage, when
reached in Chicago, refused to comment.
   Investigators based their case around records which were also
obtained by The Associated Press that suggest the younger Savage was
in Chicago while he was on Fauntroy's payroll, the sources said.
   Among those documents are notarized residency records and
election petitions the younger Savage filed with the Illinois Board
of Elections last year. Those records indicated that he was actually
in Chicago assisting his father's re-election campaign and
organizing his own run for office while he was on Fauntroy's office
payroll, the sources said.
   If the case continues, investigators likely will examine
Fauntroy's office records for the past five years to determine
whether other hiring irregularities have occurred, said sources
familiar with the case.

   Senators anxious to put the controversy over
John Tower behind them swiftly praised President Bush's selection of
Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming as defense secretary and said
confirmation hearings would begin next week.
   Bush announced the nomination of Cheney, a sixth-term congressman
and the No. 2 Republican leader in the House, on Friday, calling him
a ``widely respected man of principle.''
   Dismissing as ``history'' the long battle over Tower that ended
in defeat Thursday, Bush predicted Cheney would win confirmation
rapidly.
   Shortly after the White House announcement, leaders of the Senate
Armed Services Committee said confirmation hearings would begin next
week.
   ``I know of no impediment to his nomination,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee and a leader of the
successful effort to reject Tower.
   Nunn and John Warner, the ranking Republican on the armed
services panel, said in a joint statement that work will be
completed ``as expeditiously as possible consistent with the
president and the nominee providing the requisite background and
financial material and consistent with thoroughness and fairness.''
   The Pentagon has been without a defense chief since Feb. 1.
   ``Too much time has been wasted here,'' said Bush, who told
reporters he ordered the FBI to speed up its background checks on
Cheney.
   The announcement just 24 hours after the Senate rejected Tower in
the sharply partisan struggle was surprising in its swiftness.
   A spokesman for Cheney said White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu called Cheney before Thursday afternoon's Tower vote and
asked him to be at the White House for the roll call. Cheney got
there after the vote and spoke with National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Sununu about being defense secretary, said the
spokesman, Pete Williams.
   Bush formally offered him the post by telephone after an
hour-long meeting Friday afternoon at the White House, Williams said.
   ``Obviously things have moved very quickly in the last 24
hours,'' said Cheney, 48. ``I did agonize. It was not an easy
decision.''
   A former White House chief of staff under President Ford, Cheney
has been at the top of the party leadership in the House, but has
none of the direct defense background that Tower had.
   ``Obviously there are areas that I need to know and I'll have to
work hard to master,'' he told reporters.
   Rancor from the Tower battle was still evident even as Democrats
lined up quickly to praise Cheney and say Bush had made a shrewd
move, with little stomach evident for another drawn out
investigation.
   ``This time it will be a confirmation, not an execution,'' said
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., a member of the Armed Services
committee, said, ``I know of no reason why it wouldn't be unanimous,
but I want to reserve judgment.''
   Even amid the air of relief that Cheney had been picked, Vice
President Dan Quayle accused Senate Democrats of engaging in ``a
McCarthyite mud-slinging campaign'' against Tower and waging an
``assault on the powers of the presidency.''
   Bush said he hadn't read Quayle's remarks them. ``So I can't tell
you whether he speaks for me,'' he said.
   Cheney said he underwent heart bypass surgery last August, but
returned to work three weeks later. He said he had checked with his
doctor before accepting Bush's offer of the appointment, and was
assured his health posed no barrier.
   Cheney's selection leaves a vacuum in the Republican leadership.
As Minority Whip, Cheney had been seen as the likely successor to
House Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois.
   Conservative Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia is expected to compete
for the Republican Whip's position Cheney will leave vacant.

<HEAD>Rep. Kennedy Says He Won't Run For Governor, Announces Separation
From Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

   Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II ended speculation he
would run for Massachusetts governor in 1990, saying he did not want
to campaign while serving his congressional district and caring for
his children.
   Kennedy, 36, also announced Friday he was separating from his
wife, Sheilah, and said it was a factor in the decision not to run.
   The eldest son of the late Robert F. Kennedy was considered the
early front-runner for the 1990 race to succeed Massachusetts Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis.
   Kennedy left Boston on Friday for an undisclosed location to
spend the weekend in seclusion with his 8-year-old twins, said Chuck
McDermott, the congressman's top aide and long-time friend.
   ``This has been a very painful day for me and my family,''
Kennedy said in a prepared statement. ``As a father, my principle
obligation and deepest personal desire is to assist my children
through the most difficult time in their lives.
   ``I also have a commitment to serve the people of the 8th
Congressional District. Therefore, I feel it impossible at this time
to take on the added burden of running for another office. To end
any further speculation, I wish to make it clear that I do not
intend to run for governor.''
   Kennedy, the first member of the latest generation of Kennedys to
enter politics, instantly became a powerful fixture in Massachusetts
politics when in 1986 he won the House seat held by his uncle, John
F. Kennedy, and later former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.
   Speculation about a gubernatorial run soared when Dukakis, the
failed Democratic presidential nominee, announced in January that he
would not seek a fourth term and Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn said he
would not run for governor.
   In a separate statement on his marriage, Kennedy said he and his
wife decided to separate ``only after long and intense efforts to
find another course.''
   Kennedy married Sheila Brewster Rauch, a banker's daughter and
Philadelphia Main Line debutante, on Feb. 3, 1979. Mrs. Kennedy, 39,
a 1971 graduate of Wheaton College, met Kennedy while she was doing
graduate work at Harvard University.
   The couple had their only children, twins, Joseph Patrick Kennedy
III and Matthew Rauch Kennedy, on Oct. 4, 1980.

   Every president seems destined to call in
moments of stress for one of a stable of utility fielders _
experienced hands who know how the town works and have made few
enemies but plenty of friends along the way.
   They're called ``pragmatists.'' And Dick Cheney fits the mold.
   Cheney, a six-term congressman from Wyoming and the House
Republican whip _ second ranking Republican in the House _ was
nominated Friday by President Bush to be secretary of defense after
the Senate shot down Bush's first choice, John Tower.
   Like his friend, former Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld, and like
Frank Carlucci, who also fits the mold and who served President
Reagan as defense secretary, Cheney has plenty of Washington
experience and is known as street smart when the street is
Pennsylvania Avenue.
   Cheney, 48, has heard the call before.
   In 1974, Gerald Ford had the presidency thrust upon him when
President Nixon resigned. Rumsfeld, a Ford friend, asked Cheney to
join Ford's White House staff. Cheney wound up putting in 14
grueling months as the president's chief of staff.
   ``In the six months before the (1976) election,'' recalled
Cheney's wife, Lynne, ``Dick was home for one whole day _ one Sunday
_ and that was all.''
   When Ford was defeated, Cheney went home to Wyoming to win the
sparsely-populated state's seat of congressman-at-large in 1978. He
was re-elected by large margins five more times.
   After one term, fellow Republicans elected him chairman of the
House Republican Policy Committee, the fourth highest rung in the
Republican ladder. Ever since, it has been assumed that Cheney
someday would become speaker of the House if he stayed there and if
the GOP ever won control.
   Cheney suffered a mild heart attack in that first race for the
House. Last August, he underwent heart bypass surgery after
suffering two more in the next 10 years. He said after the bypass
that he anticipated ``15 or 20 trouble-free years.''
   The first question put to him Friday by the White House press
corps was whether his health was up to the strain of the new job.
   He said he had been back at work three weeks after the bypass
operation and that he had skied at Vail, Colo., last Christmas. He
said he checked with his cardiologist before accepting Bush's offer;
his doctor said there was no medical reason why he couldn't take the
job.
   Bush praised Cheney as someone who had struggled with a budget,
become familiar with defense issues as a member of the House
Intellignce Committee, knew arms control, strategic defense policy
choices, Central American policy.
   ``He's a thoughtful man, a quiet man, a strong man,'' said Bush.
   Said Cheney:
   ``I am glad to be part of the team and eager to get to work.''
   Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., the son of a longtime
Agriculture Department worker, and attended elementary and high
school in Casper, Wyo.
   His courtship of Lynne began in high school. He was football
co-captain and senior class president; he helped her win election as
homecoming queen.
   He attended Yale _ Bush's alma mater _ for two years but didn't
like life in the East and transferred to the University of Wyoming,
where he caught up with Lynne.
   They married in 1964 and both went off to the University of
Wisconsin for doctorates. She earned hers but politics lured him to
Washington in 1968, where he was a congressional fellow and became a
Rumsfeld protege.
   Cheney served under Rumsfeld in the anti-poverty agency of the
Nixon years, on the Nixon White House staff and under Rumsfeld again
as assistant director of the Cost of Living Council, Nixon's agency
to combat inflation.
   In the House, Cheney has fought for aid for the Nicaraguan
Contras and fought on the floor against one of the most powerful
Democrats _ Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee _ to make a tax revision bill closer to Reagan's designs
than Rostenkowski would have preferred.
   During the Reagan years, Lynne Cheney became as well known in
Washington as her husband. She raised two children, put in a stint
as an editor at the Washingtonian magazine, took over _ and still
runs _ the National Endowment for the Humanities, wrote a novel,
``Executive Privilege'' and, with him, wrote ``Kings of the Hill,''
a study of eight past speakers of the House.
   She dedicated her novel, ``To Dick, who has shaped my life and
even one or two of my opinions.''

   ``Today'' show weatherman Willard Scott
might see it as a warming trend from the west _ a blast of good will
from letter-writers who want to help him weather his stormy
relations with host Bryant Gumbel.
   ``A group of us at the office felt Willard might not get a great
shake unless we got together to say we want Willard,'' said Thom
Ris, organizer of the ``We Want Willard'' Campaign.
   Ris was moved to action by reports of a Gumbel memo to NBC brass
that criticized Scott and said he was killing the show with his
``bad taste.''
   ``My feeling is that the people in the networks get kind of
isolated, but there's a real desire for corny, comic relief from
some of the serious stuff we get in the morning,'' Ris said Thursday.
   He said the campaign is aimed at getting 250,000 Scott supporters
to write to NBC on Scott's behalf.

   Spiritual channeler J.Z. Knight and her estranged
husband, Jeffrey Knight, tried to cut down on their expenses, but
could only get by on slightly less than $40,000 a month, according
to court papers.
   Neither of the Knights is commenting publicly on the breakup, but
their lawyers say the two are working out a settlement agreement.
   Ms. Knight purports to be the medium for a 35,000-year-old spirit
named Ramtha, whose followers include actress Shirley MacLaine, who
has written that she knew Ramtha in a previous incarnation.
   Ms. Knight, one of the first spirit channelers in the New Age
movement, runs seminars in which people pay hundreds of dollars to
hear the pronouncements she delivers in a gruff voice she says
belongs to the spirit.
   According to papers filed for Knight in Pierce County Superior
Court, Ms. Knight has monthly earnings of $240,000 from the Ramtha
seminars.
   Knight said in the court papers that he and his wife had tried to
keep expenses to $20,000 a month, but they couldn't keep below
``$37,000 in any one month as a personal budget _ the bulk of that
being spent on her.''
   Knight asked for a ``small monthly amount'' of $10,000 in a
request for spousal support. A trial date is set for April 8.

   Former Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins,
honored by hundreds of well-wishers on his 80th birthday, says he
has no regrets about the tough decisions he made that may have cost
him politically.
   ``So many times my own conscience was different than what would
say the majority conscience was,'' said Collins, who is credited
with helping the civil rights movement in the 1950s while governor.
``In those times, I stayed with my own conscience. ... Usually it
brought me out fine.''
   Several hundred people, including Collins' wife of 57 years, Mary
Call, and their children and grandchildren, gathered Friday at the
Florida State University Law School Commons to honor the former
governor.
   In 1957, Collins vetoed a bill that would have given school
boards the power to shut down schools rather than admit black
children. The veto was upheld by a slim margin.

   Joe Clark, the high school principal
whose disciplinary methods are the focus of the film ``Lean on Me,''
says he's not questioning his suspension for arranging an assembly
at which four strippers performed.
   What he does bother him, he said Thursday, is that the Board of
Education in Paterson, N.J., and superintendent are ``puritanical
demogogues.''
   ``For them to get sanctimonious on me,'' Clark said. ``They were
going to suspend somebody. So I said, `You want to suspend somebody,
suspend me. I need a rest. I'm tired and you're going to pay me.'''
   The five-day suspension is to begin Monday.
   The assembly at Eastside High School in New Jersey included an
act by a dancer who stripped four male dancers down to their
G-strings. Clark was not at the school the day of the assembly last
month and has said he never expected the dance group he hired to
lapse into lasciviousness.
   Clark, interviewed during a speaking engagement at Slippery Rock
University, said the controversy over his hard-line disciplinary
methods has followed him since he became principal of Eastside in
1982.
   ``I'm seriously thinking about getting out of education,'' Clark
said.

   Olympic gold medalist Tim Daggett says
civil liability laws are threatening youth sports programs and could
hurt the United States' ability to compete internationally.
   Daggett, who won a gold medal in 1984 as a U.S. gymnastics team
member, said Friday he does not have to look far to see the impact
of lawsuits on youth sports. His former high school, which named its
gymnasium for him, recently dropped gymnastics because of liability
risks.
   ``That hurts a lot,'' said Daggett, 26, a native of West
Springfield, Mass.
   Daggett was in Green Bay to speak at a reception sponsored in
part by state Sen. Jerome Van Sistine, who has been a proponent of
changing state liability laws.
   ``If we don't dramatically change our civil liability laws, we
could seriously damage our chances to be competitive in all
sports,'' Daggett said.

   A bobcat turned wimp is being sent to
Texas for survival training.
   The 35-pound male cat has been in captivity at the Swope Park
nature center since September, when it blithely entered a home.
Naturalist Kevin Hogan said the cat, which obviously had been around
humans, was as tame as a domestic cat and would not survive if
placed back in the wild.
   Hogan said the feeble feline was being sent today to ``real
bobcat experts,'' Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Inc. in Boerne,
Texas.
   The 8-to-9-month-old cat will be removed from human contact and
placed among other cats on a 75,000-acre refuge in northwest of San
Antonio.
   ``It's not difficult as long as they're fairly young, less than a
year,'' said Kathleen Dowling, assistant director of the refuge.
   ``The instincts click when they get around other bobcats,'' she
said. ``All the memories come rushing back.''
   To summon up its feral instincts, the cat will be fed small
rabbits, rodents, chickens and other birds it would catch in the
wild.
   ``We want them to learn to identify these animals as food and not
just as toys,'' she said. ``When he is showing typical wild bobcat
behavior he will be released.''

   Thanks to his pet German shepherds, Merrill
Cole awoke and escaped from a house fire. And by day's end, he found
he had eight more canine best friends.
   ``I was asleep and could feel something hitting me. When I woke
up everything was in a blaze and the dog was there waiting for me,''
Cole said in recalling the electrical fire that began at 3 a.m.
Thursday in his living room, and the subsequent efforts of his dogs,
Jason and Pup.
   ``Praise the Lord, I'm lucky to be living. They say a dog is
man's best friend. Well, these dogs are definitely my best
friends,'' he said.
   Little did Cole know the day's excitement had only begun with the
fire.
   Cole and his daughter, Bonnie Kelly, went to the house to see
what could be salvaged, returning with only an antique framed photo
of the family. Then they found Pup with eight newborn puppies.
   ``I think all the commotion got to her,'' Cole said.

   The government has, for the first time, set
national hydrocarbon emission standards for gasoline.
   In an attempt to head off an increasingly severe urban smog
problem this summer, the Environmental Protection Agency announced
Friday that gasoline volatility levels in most parts of the country
has been set at 10.5 pounds per inch. Gasoline volatility generally

<HEAD>Younis' Sky Piracy Trial Goes to Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury deliberations in the sky piracy trial of
Fawaz Younis are set to resume Monday to determine his fate on
charges in connection with the hijacking of Royal Jordanian Airlines
flight in June 1985.
   The judge's instructions to the jury which met for four hours
Friday may have undercut the defendant's argument that Younis, who
witnesses identified as the leader in a group of four heavily armed
men that stormed the plane, acted as he did because he was a victim
of the civil war that has engulfed Lebanon since 1975. .
   ``Orders to hijack a plane ... are illegal orders,'' U.S.
District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. told jurors. ``Obedience to
illegal orders is no defense,'' said Robinson, emphasizing that only
if Younis did not know that hijacking was illegal should he be
acquitted.
   Neither the two Americans aboard the aircraft nor any of the
other 70 passengers and crew members were injured in the incident
which is viewed as a test of a 1984 ``long-arm'' statute that
asserts U.S. jurisdiction over cases involving American hostages
taken abroad.

   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico applauded a Bush administration proposal to
help nations with crushing foreign debts, but embattled Venezuela
called the proposal a ``too timid'' approach to a potentially
explosive problem.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on Friday unveiled the
proposal that endorses voluntary efforts by commercial banks to
forgive part of the $410 billion they are owed by the largest debtor
countries, including Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela.
   In so doing, Brady signalled that the Bush administration intends
to shed the 1985 ``Baker Plan,'' promoted by then-Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III, that had favored new lending instead of debt
forgiveness.
   The government of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
which is trying to restructure payments on its $107 billion debt,
called Brady's suggestions ``a first and positive response to
Mexico's position.
   ``The change of emphasis that gives priority to the reduction of
the debt and its servicing, and not to further indebtedness as was
the case in the past, is particularly positive,'' Mexico's Treasury
Department said in a statement.
   Salinas ordered Mexican Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe to
Washington on Monday to take up the proposal with Brady.
   The Argentine government said the proposal was ``a promising step
forward,'' and that it hoped follow-up developments ``are congruent
with the expectations awakened'' by the plan.
   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, where rioting last
week over government austerity measures spurred by the nation's
foreign debt left more than 300 dead, had a lukewarm reaction.
   ``I think the (proposals) are very timid and that they do not
satisfy the minimum aspirations of Latin America,'' Perez said.
   ``However, this opening will lead us to a dialogue with the
administration of President Bush (that will result) in a better
understanding of the situation we are going through and our urgent
needs,'' Perez added.
   In Brazil, the Third World's largest debtor nation, Finance
Minister Mailson da Nobrega called reports of the new plan ``very
positive.''
   But he warned the crushing debt continued to threaten political
stability in Latin America. Without decisive action from creditor
countries, ``populists and demagogues'' will arise to power, da
Nobrega warned.
   ``People will believe in messiahs. Radical groups will replace
moderate ones,'' he said.
   The Venezuelan riots were a ``clear alert'' that Latin America's
debt situation is ``socially and politically unbearable,'' he added.
   Brazil, which in 1985 returned to civilian government after 21
years of military rule, holds presidential elections on Nov. 15, the
first popular vote since 1960. Media polls show leftist leaders with
high popularity.
   Latin American nations have spent $139 billion since 1984 to
service the debt, but with no appreciable reduction of indebtedness,
according to the Latin American Economic System, a regional
think-tank based in Caracas, Venezuela.
   To encourage the banks to forgive part of the debt, the Bush
administration called on the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund to help provide guarantees for the remaining debt owed
by the poor countries.
   Emphasizing its initiative, the administration late Friday said
it was extending a $450 million emergency loan for Venezuela. The
short-term financing is to be repaid when Venezuela begins receiving
new loans from the IMF in April.
   Brazil's Planning Ministry announced Friday the World Bank had
offered Brazil $1 billion for electric power development, despite
past objections to the country's nuclear energy program.
   In a joint communique, the ministry and bank also said the bank
had offered a special 2-year aid program to help Brazil meet the
bank's requirements for matching funds.
   Foreign credits are essential to Brazil's efforts to service its
$115 billion foreign debt. Each year, Brazil pays between $12
billion and $14 billion on interest payments alone.
   Mexico paid $14 billion in interest and principal in 1988 and
will pay another $16 billion this year. Latin America's other big
debtors are Argentina, $50 billion, and Venezuela, $33 billion.

<HEAD>U.N. Envoy Sees Progress In Iran-Iraq Peace Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.N. official says Iran and Iraq are
making progress toward breaking their stalemate and agreeing on a
permanent peace in their Persian Gulf war.
   ``We may be on the right track,'' said Swedish U.N. Ambassador
Jan K. Eliasson, the special U.N. envoy to the gulf talks. He would
not discuss specific proposals that have been considered by the two
sides.
   Eliasson met for two days last week with Iranian diplomats led by
a deputy foreign minister, and held meetings Wednesday and Thursday
with the Iraqis, led by U.N. ambassador Ismat Kittani.
   The talks are aimed at arranging a meeting between Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq
Aziz.
   ``We discussed with the parties, at length, both matters of
procedure and matters of substance, and how we are now to best
proceed to make progress,'' Eliasson told reporters.
   ``I would say we are making some progress when it comes to
defining the framework, the shape of the talks, and we hope this
progress will continue and will be evident on the ministerial level,
the political level,'' he said.
   The Iranian and Iraqi foreign ministers were tentatively
scheduled to meet in late March, but Eliasson indicated that
deadline may not be met.
   Since the Moslem month of daytime prayer and fasting, Ramadan,
begins in late March and lasts four weeks, the talks could well be
delayed until May.
   Velayati and Aziz are to meet at an undisclosed location
somewhere near U.N. headquarters to resume the peace talks, which
deadlocked as soon as they began last Aug. 25 in Geneva.
   The talks broke down over Iraq's demand that Iran give up the
right to search ships in international waters for war cargo bound
for Iraq. Tehran has not actually searched any ships since a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect Aug. 20.
   Baghdad also insists that Iran agree to a plan to have the United
Nations dredge the Shatt al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the
sea.
   Tehran insists that the next step in the peace process must be a
withdrawal of troops to their own territory. Iraq still holds about
260 square miles of Iranian territory.
   Tensions along their 740-mile front line are becoming
increasingly tense, especially near an artificial lake Iranian
engineers created as a barrier near the Shatt al-Arab.
   Shelling broke out near the water work on Monday and Tuesday,
according to the office of top U.N. peacekeeper Marrack Goulding.
   Reports of the exchanges sent jitters through the oil markets
Wednesday as a rumor circulated that the war had resumed.

<HEAD>Nakasone's Account of Role in Scandal Questioned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who last
month denied knowledge of a Japanese company's controversial
purchase of a U.S.-built computer, was aware of the sale more than
three years ago, reports said today.
   Nationally-circulated newspapers and televison news here said
Nakasone told a news conference in New York in October 1985 that
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. would buy a supercomputer from
the United States.
   Nakasone, prime minister between 1982 and 1987, told reporters
Feb. 27 he knew nothing in advance about the supercomputer deal,
which is linked to widening stock scandal involving scores of public
officials.
   The inconsistency of his statements likely will worsen a
political deadlock in the administration of Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita and increase opposition pressure for Takeshita to resign,
analysts said.
   Nakasone released a statement saying his 1985 comments in New
York was the result of a misunderstanding.
   ``I think I made the statement based on my memory of news reports
back then,'' it said. ``The trade friction between Japan and the
United States was at its critical stage then and I wanted to show
our willingness to buy supercomputers made by Cray Research.''
   The scandal-ridden NTT purchased a supercomputer made by
Minneapolis-based Cray Research Inc. in May 1986 and resold it in
December to Recruit Co., a publishing conglomerate at the center of
the massive stock-trading scandal.
   Opposition parties charge that Nakasone directed NTT to buy a
U.S.-made supercomputer and sell it to Recruit amid the friction
between Tokyo and Washington over access to the supercomuter market.
   The parliamentary session on the 1989 fiscal year's budget has
been stalled since Wednesday when the government and the governing
Liberal Democratic Party rejected opposition demands to call
Nakasone to Parliament for questioning.
   Nakasone was among 159 politicians, business leaders and
bureaucrats who bought bargain-priced stocks in Recruit-Cosmos, a
subsidiary of Recruit, before the shares went public.
   Buyers earned handsome profits when the company was made public
shortly afterward and share prices shot up.
   Three Cabinet ministers have stepped down since December because
of their link in the Recruit scandal and the administration's
popularity ratings have hit their lowest levels since Takeshita took
office in November 1987.
   Prosecutors have arrested 10 corporate executives and public
officials for bribery and securities law violations. More arrests
are expected.
   Opposition lawmakers investigating the scandal charged Nakasone
was heavily involved. Three of Nakasone's aides earned more than
$465,000 in profits from the stock deal.
   NTT, the former public telecommunications utility, was privatized
in 1985. Three NTT executives, including ex-chairman Hisashi Shinto,
were arrested for taking bribes from Recruit.
   NTT, the largest company in the world in terms of stock values,
announced Friday that in a gesture of public regret it will cut the
salaries of 35 executives next month up to 20 percent for six months.

<HEAD>Opposition Gets Access To Media During Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solidarity labor movement says the
government has promised the opposition free access to state-run
media during the new parliamentary elections.
   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, spokesman for the outlawed movement, also
said the union will support candidates in the June voting and wants
Solidarity candidates to be able to present themselves publically as
Solidarity members.
   ``If these elections are supposed to be at least partly
democratic, we must have a chance to fight in them. And that is why
our access to the mass media during the ... campaigns is so
important,'' Onyszkiewicz said.
   An agreement between the government and the opposition will
create a new national legislature _ a senate _ that will act as the
upper chamber of Parliament. The current legislature, the Sejm,
would be the lower chamber.
   Opposition candidates will be allowed to take part in what may be
the first national democratic elections in the communist block. In
addition, 35 percent of the seats in the existing Sejm will be set
aside for contested elections.
   However, a new office of president with broad powers also will be
created, and that likely will remain in the hands of the ruling
communists.
   Nevertheless, the agreement is so far the most significant
development during the six weeks of talks between the opposition and
government on ways to solve Poland's crushing economic and social
problems.
   The discussions also have resulted in agreements in principle to
legalize Solidarity and other independent groups outlawed after a
martial-law crackdown in December 1981.
   It had been uncertain if the oppositon, which has no legally
functioning political party and no legal newspapers or broadcast
media, would be able to get its message to the voters.
   Solidarity activist Adam Michnik, speaking after a meeting of
negotiators Friday, said authorities promised that opposition groups
will be able to use state television, radio and newspapers.
   ``The government coalition side declared that the opposition, or
let's call it the social side, will have access to the mass media
for the period of the election campaign,'' he said. ``But we don't
treat it as access to the mass media in general. ... This is still
the subject of deep conflict.''
   The opposition is seeking some program time on state television
and radio to use as it chooses. Communist Party negotiators oppose
that, saying it would undermine the internal integrity of the
state-run broadcast media.
   Authorities have agreed that the opposition will be allowed to
publish its own newspapers.
   The powers of the new Senate have not been established, but
negotiators said it would exercise some sort of veto control over
acts passed by the Sejm.
   Opposition negotiators have agreed to a guarantee that the
Communist Party and its allies would control 65 percent of the
Sejm's 460 seats, but for the first time opposition candidates who
gather 3,000 nominating signatures will be able to run for the other
seats.

<HEAD>Eastern To Restore Flights; Unions Charge Continental Crews Brought

   Eastern Airlines prepared to more than double its
strike-depleted flight schedule, but union leaders questioned its
ability to expand operations and vowed to extend pickets to sister
carrier Continental Airlines.
   Eastern announced its expansion plans as passengers began
returning to its Northeast Shuttle, lured by bargain fares of $12 a
seat. A federal bankruptcy judge also helped the carrier keep some
planes aloft by authorizing Eastern to pay non-striking employees.
   Meanwhile, lawyers for 8,500 striking Machinists accused the
airline of timing Thursday's bankruptcy filing to avoid paying wages
to union members. Attorney Robert Clayman said he would go to U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York to get an estimated $7.5 million owed
for the past week.
   The crippled carrier said it planned to restore 80 flights a day,
mainly major East Coast and Latin American routes. That would raise
its total number of flights to more than 140 a day _ less than 15
percent of its prestrike schedule.
   ``This is the beginning of a new smaller, restructured and viable
Eastern Airlines,'' Eastern President Phil Bakes said Friday.
   Eastern said it had 200 pilots available at the start of the
week, when it laid off 9,500 workers and drastically reduced
operations. In addition, spokeswoman Cory Zywotow said that ``since
the bankruptcy filing, pilots have been calling in to report back to
work.''
   The pilots' union, which has been honoring the Machinists'
pickets as well as flight attendants, questioned whether the company
could sustain the increased schedule for long without violating
Federal Aviation Administration restrictions on individual flying
time.
   ``They're going to be able to slightly augment the current
schedule, but they're just trying to maximize the available pool of
pilots,'' said J.B. Stokes, a 17-year Eastern pilot and spokesman
for the Air Line Pilots Association.
   Pilots accused Eastern of ``stepping up its campaign to threaten,
coerce and otherwise entice pilots to cross'' the picket line.
   ``This includes illegal offers of bonuses for second officers and
phone calls to pilots' homes, attempting to intimidate spouses, and
even their children, with threats that their breadwinner will never
be able to work again for Eastern,'' said Ron Cole, a pilots' union
spokesman.
   Strikers also contended the crews on the restored flights
beginning Sunday and Monday will be from Continental and vowed to
picket that airline, which like Eastern is owned by Texas Air Corp.
   Machinists' union officer Wally Haber said Eastern has brought
100 pilots and 60 mechanics from Continental to Miami to operate the
restored flights.
   Union members today planned a show of solidarity at labor rallies
in several cities including Miami, Chicago and Buffalo.
   The Machinists began picketing Continental in its home base of
Houston and at Philadelphia International Airport, and more than 300
people rallied Friday in support of the strikers at Continental's
terminal at Newark International Airport in New Jersey.
   ``There's going to be an all-out effort to stop Continental from
operating _ legally,'' said Frank DeMaria, secretary-treasurer of
the Machinists local in Newark.
   Travel agents were wary about booking travelers on Eastern after
thousands of ticket holders were stranded around the nation. Many of
those became unsecured creditors when the company filed for Chapter
11 reorganization and will have to file claims with the bankruptcy
court to get a refund.
   Eastern intends to resume service between Miami and 13 Latin
American cities, and between Boston and Washington, Miami and San
Juan, Puerto Rico, Miami and New York, and New York and Montreal,
Eastern officials said.
   Company officials said they have recalled about 90 non-union
reservations agents to prepare for the expansion, spurred in part by
Friday's offering of a $12 one-way fare on Eastern's shuttle between
Washington, New York and Boston.
   Steve Davis, an Eastern spokesman at Boston's Logan International
Airport, said Boston-New York shuttles flew 90 percent full Friday.
Shuttle flights earlier in the week reportedly carried as few as
seven passengers.
   The $12 fare will go up to $49 Monday, still below normal prices
of $69 to $99 on weekends and $99 on weekdays.
   Before the strike, Eastern was the nation's seventh-largest
carrier with 1,050 flights a day and some 31,200 employees. The work
force has dwindled to 1,500 and losses have grown to some $4 million
daily since the strike began.
   Meanwhile, a judge in New York extended indefinitely an order
barring commuter railroad workers from honoring any picket lines
thrown up by Eastern's machinists. A federal appeals court in
Philadelphia issued a similar ban for that area.

   Analysts say prospects are good for
cutting conventional arms in Europe because of the similarities in
the initial proposals of NATO and Warsaw Pact nations.
   ``The starting positions are quite reasonable (and) give plenty
of room for compromise,'' said Richard Fieldhouse, a research fellow
at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden.
   The 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
seven of the Warsaw Pact began negotiations Thursday in Vienna on
reducing conventional arms in the region.
   ``We are not really that far apart,'' chief U.S. negotiator
Stephen Ledogar said after the opening session. Soviet negotiator
Oleg Grinevsky said the gaps were not insurmountable.
   ``It looks like there's political will (and) interest to do the
things required for an agreement,'' Fieldhouse said Friday. ``The
question is: Can those things be maintained _ are they real and are
they permanent?''
   Negotiators will be under enormous pressure to succeed. A 15-year
effort to cut those weapons in Central Europe failed.
   In their starting proposal, NATO negotiators called on the Warsaw
Pact to cut tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers. NATO would
make smaller cuts of 5 percent to 10 percent in those categories.
   In its initial offer, the Warsaw Pact proposed a first-phase
reduction ranging between 10 percent and 15 percent of the lowest
level of arms held by either side.
   The percentage cuts proposed by each side are not far apart,
although the East wants the trims to include aircraft, which Western
officials oppose.
   NATO contends the Soviets and their allies have built up a huge
superiority in conventional weapons in Europe. The alliance wants
the East bloc to make much greater cuts in their forces to bring the
two sides to equal strength.
   Analysts said the Soviets appear ready to follow the West's call
for greater East bloc reductions to reach parity in the weapons
systems.
   They noted Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's recent promises
of reductions in his nation's troops and defense spending.
   ``You don't make unilateral cuts unless you recognize you have a
lot and too many,'' said Fieldhouse. ``That's a big point in favor
of progress.''
   The West would like a total of 40,000 main battle tanks, 33,000
artillery pieces and 56,000 armored troop carriers in Europe. Each
side would be allowed half the total.
   U.S. officials estimated this would require the Warsaw Pact to
get rid of 31,000 tanks and NATO, 2,551. For artillery, the cuts
would amount to 26,900 for the East and 828 for the West.
   The officials calculated the Warsaw Pact proposals, using a 10
percent reduction, would mean cuts of 31,849 Eastern tanks and 3,069
for NATO. The East's artillery would be slashed by 20,206 pieces and
NATO's by 5,706. The East would give up 28,120 armored personnel
carriers and the West 4,690.
   Despite similarities in positions, the differences portend long,
possibly acrimonious, debates.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has insisted the
talks cover aircraft, an area in which the Soviets contend the West
holds the edge.

<HEAD>Government To Free Former Somoza Guards This Month</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government will free nearly 1,900
former members of ousted President Anastasio Somoza's national guard
on March 19, the chief of state security said.
   Commander Lenin Cerna said the jailed guardsmen will be freed
after the National Assembly formally approves a pardon request from
President Daniel Ortega.
   The pardons are the result of agreements signed by Ortega and the
presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica at a
Feb. 13-14 summit in El Salvador.
   Cerna, who presides over a commission overseeing the releases,
said no restrictions will be placed on the former guardsmen. They
will be free to leave the country, he said Friday.
   Ortega said earlier this week that 41 ex-guardsmen would remain
in jail.
   The president defended the plan to pardon the former guardsmen,
who were jailed after the leftist Sandinistas ousted Somoza in a
1979 revolution.
   Ortega called on Nicaraguans to give guardsmen who are released
``the opportunity to reintegrate themselves into society.''
   ``The guardsman who wants to rejoin society has nothing to
fear,'' Ortega said. But he warned that those who ``return to their
criminal activities'' would face ``popular anger in its full force.''
   The 1,894 prisoners will be released during a ceremony at the
Modelo Prison in Tipitapa, 14 miles west of Managua, Cerna said.
   In their agreement, the region's presidents also said they will
draft a plan by May 15 to dismantle the 11,000-member Nicaraguan
rebel army. The rebels, known as Contras, fled to Honduras after
U.S. military assistance ended last year.
   The United States began supporting the Contras in 1981. The
Sandinista government and the rebels signed a provisional truce in
March 1988, but talks on a permanent cease-fire have broken down.

   A fugitive Indian arrested on kidnapping
charges after failing to obtain asylum at the Soviet consulate says
he is a victim of persecution and sees ``no hope in the American
government.''
   Eddie Hatcher, 31, was arrested by FBI agents Friday on a warrant
for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for his role in taking
hostages at a North Carolina newspaper last year, said FBI spokesman
Chuck Latting. He was arrested immediately after leaving the
consulate.
   Hatcher had gone to the Soviet consulate to seek asylum and
protest alleged inequities in the U.S. justice system, said
Bernadette Sambrano, a friend who accompanied him. Soviet officials
asked him to leave after about three hours, said Sambrano, a member
of the International Indian Treaty Council.
   Consulate press attache Sergei Aivazian declined comment.
   Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs, 20, held up to 20 people hostage in
the offices of The Robesonian newspaper for 10 hours on Feb. 1,
1988. The two Tuscarora Indians said they wanted to draw attention
to their claims that law enforcement officials were involved in drug
trafficking and other corruption.
   The siege ended when Gov. Jim Martin agreed to investigate their
charges. A task force found no evidence to support the claims, and
Martin later said they were based on ``rumor and gossip.''
   In October, a federal jury acquitted both men on federal
hostage-taking and firearms charges after a three-week trial. But a
Robeson County grand jury indicted the two men on kidnapping charges
in December.
   Hatcher was arrested in Pembroke, but Jacobs fled the state and
sought sanctuary at the Onondaga Indian Reservation near Syracuse,
N.Y.
   Hatcher fled to the same reservation after his $25,000 bond was
posted by the National Council of Churches. He later left New York
and sought refuge on the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho. He
disappeared several weeks ago after being taken into tribal custody.
   ``The state of N.C. and the government of the United States has
made every vindictive attempt to destroy my life, my family and my
people,'' Hatcher said in a handwritten statement sent out of the
Soviet consulate. ``They will not cease until they have accomplished
this.
   ``I see no hope in the American government, nor do I see
fairness.''
   Jacobs was arrested in New York after leaving the reservation and
a state judge is considering whether he should be extradited to
North Carolina.
   Harris Tabac, an attorney representing Hatcher, said the decision
to retry Hatcher on state charges was a ``boldly illegal move'' by a
``brutally racist county.''
   ``In our attitude, the trial already occurred and we won,'' he
said.
   Tabac said he will ask for court hearings to argue that Hatcher
would be risking his life by returning to North Carolina and has no
chance of getting a fair trial there.
   Earlier, in a telephone call from the consulate to The Associated
Press bureau in Raleigh, N.C., Hatcher said, ``I'm tired of being
persecuted for winning the federal case.''

   A 7-pound cubic sculpture set to soar into space on
Monday aboard the shuttle Discovery is the nation's first official
interstellar art offering and _ for the foreseeable future _ its
last.
   ``Boundless Aperture,'' the creation of Boston artist Lowry
Burgess, was cleared for space travel by a National Aeronautics and
Space Administration committee in August 1984 as part of a new
non-scientific payload program.
   That was at a time when the space agency was looking both to open
the shuttle program to the public and to accommodate civilians'
repeated requests to fly non-scientific objects.
   But the committee was disbanded less than two years later after
the shuttle carrying teacher Christa McAuliffe and six astronauts
exploded. The tragedy prompted space agency officials to rein in
civilian access to the space program.
   Burgess' work will be on Monday's scheduled flight as a special
exception based on a prior commitment, said NASA spokeswoman
Graciela Iguina.
   ``There is no intention to send any other objects up at this
time,'' said Tony Maull, who was staff director for the
Non-Scientific Payloads Committee that had approved Burgess' work.
   In his bid to put his work in orbit, the artist traveled several
times to Washington, appeared for questioning before a NASA panel,
made hundreds of phone calls and sent as many letters over the last
decade in an effort to persuade officials his work was worthy of
flight.
   ``I make no claim to understanding his work,'' Maull said, ``but
he definitely is not attempting to get a free ride for a commercial
enterprise at the taxpayer's expense.''
   NASA had been approached through the years by more than a few
hucksters who sensed the profit potential in selling ballpoint pens
or pendants that had been to space and back, but Maull said the
agency was interested in taking the cultural high road.
   ``This is a man who's invested a substantial portion of his life
in this project,'' he said.
   Burgess conceived the ``Boundless Aperture'' more than two
decades ago as part of a larger project entitled ``The Quiet Axis.''
As part of a visionary axis, the artist has already embedded one
sculpture in the Pacific Ocean floor off Easter Island and hauled
another into central Afghanistan, where it was placed amid the Hindu
Kush mountain range.
   Burgess, a professor at the Massachusetts College of Art in
Boston, said ``Boundless Aperture'' extends his work to space, a
metaphor for the potential of the human imagination.
   ``It's a part of saying there are many possibilities for us ...
that space is going to open up many new things for us both out there
and back here on Earth,'' he said.
   Burgess said the sculpture, which will on its return be placed
inside a rock outcropping on the grounds of the DeCordova Museum in
the Boston suburb of Lincoln, is ``a nothing surrounded by nothing
that is something.''
   It consists of a 6-inch cube filled with distilled water, inside
of which floats another cube bearing colorful holographic plates
inscribed with poetry.
   The artist concedes his latest sculpture is fairly esoteric, but
insists that anyone can appreciate space art.
   ``There are more art enthusiasts out there than the people at the
museums,'' he said. ``A lot of people are very eager to see a
cultural dimension to the space effort. It's humanizing.''

   The military investigation of last summer's
shootdown of an Iranian airliner found the Navy cruiser Vincennes
was clearly responsible for the accident, but the Pentagon's brass
decided no disciplinary action was warranted.
   In a case that went all the way up the ladder to then-Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and Adm. William J. Crowe, the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon announced last August the
ship's crew had made several understandable mistakes under ``the fog
of war.''
   The military board of inquiry reported the Vincennes was in the
midst of a surface battle with Iranian gunboats when Iran's Flight
655 took off from Bandar Abbas, and the ship's crew misidentified
the commercial plane as a hostile F-14 jet fighter flying a direct
course for the cruiser.
   The board also concluded that Iran bore a substantial measure of
blame itself for allowing a commercial plane to take off from an
airport used by both commercial and military aircraft during the
middle of a battle.
   The Iranian airliner also failed to respond to repeated radio
warnings, the board found.
   Carlucci and Crowe said they had concluded the crew members acted
as they did because they weren't about to take any chances with
their own ship's safety. That attitude had been reinforced by the
fate of the USS Stark, which was struck by two missiles in May, 1987
when accidentally fired upon by an Iraqi jet fighter. A total of 37
crewmen were killed.
   ``It was only prudent for Capt. (Will) Rogers to assume that the
(radar) contact was related to his engagement with the Iranian boats
until proven otherwise,'' Crowe said on Aug. 19 in releasing the
inquiry report.
   ``The proof never came,'' Crowe said. ``Given the time available,
the commanding officer could hardly meet his obligation to protect
his ship and crew and also clear up all of the possible anomalies or
ambiguities.
   ``I believe that given the operating environment, Capt. Rogers
acted reasonably and did what his nation expected of him in the
defense of his ship and crew.''
   The destruction of the airliner was ``a by-product of the
Iran-Iraq war,'' the admiral concluded.

<HEAD>Border Troops Alert For Possible Chakma Rebel Attack</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bangladesh placed troops on alert along
the Indian border to guard against attacks by Buddhist rebel
tribesmen, military sources in the region said today.
   The sources in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in southeastern
Bangladesh said they had received reports that rebels from the
Chakma tribe were planning raids from sanctuaries in India.
   India has repeatedly denied the rebels have sanctuaries on its
side of the border.
   The Bangladeshi sources, who were contacted by telephone and
spoke on condition of anonymity, also said India had placed its own
military troops on alert along the border.
   An Indian government spokesman in New Delhi called the report ``a
load of rubbish.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The rebels have been fighting a bush war against the Bangladeshi
government in an effort to win autonomy for the region and push out
Moslem settlers. More than 3,000 people have been killed since the
revolt began in 1974.
   On Feb. 28, the Bangladeshi government passed legislation to give
the hill tracts limited autonomy in an effort to end the insurgency.
Under the new law, hill tract residents would elect local councils
with the powers to administer and develop the region, appoint police
and maintain law and order.
   The military sources said the anticipated rebel offensive may be
an effort to sabotage the government's peace plan in an effort to
win greater autonomy.
   Chakmas make up about 75 percent of the 800,000 people living in
the hill tracts. At one point the number of Moslem Bengali settlers
reached 300,000, but in 1985 President Hussain Muhammad Ershad
banned further Moslem migration to the area.
   The number of settlers declined as the Chakmas continued their
attacks. Western diplomats have estimated only about 100,000
settlers remain. Some other Buddhist tribes also live in the region.
   The area is impoverished but has unexploited pockets of natural
gas. Efforts to survey and tap the gas in the early 1970s were
halted because of rebel attacks.
   The region is one of the few parts of Bangladesh that generally
remains above water during perennial floods in the densely populated
nation of 110 million people.

<TEXT>
   Additional allegations of fraudulent activities
have been leveled against former Philippines President Ferdinand E.
Marcos and his wife, Imelda, by a federal grand jury in Manhattan.
   In a superseding indictment made public Friday, the Marcoses were
accused of illegally funneling an additional $77 million into this
country.
   Missing from the new indictment was the name of Panamanian lawyer
Jaime Alberto Arias, who originally was charged with obstructing
justice and mail fraud.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston declined to comment on
why the 54-year-old Arias was not listed or say if he was
cooperating with prosecutors.
   Except for the Marcoses, all of the other defendants had been
classified as fugitives. Among the remaining defendants in the case
are Saudi Arabian businessman and arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi.
   The Marcoses, living in exile in Honolulu since fleeing the
Philippines three years ago, were indicted for an alleged
racketeering conspiracy in October.
   That indictment, which named eight co-defendants as well as a
California bank, accused the Marcoses of plundering more than $100
million from their homeland's treasury to buy choice Manhattan real
estate and expensive artworks.
   The new allegations, while not adding any more counts to the
six-count indictment, accused the Marcoses and other co-conspirators
of fraudulently bringing to this country an additional $65 million
allegedly stolen from the Philippines.
   The source of an additional $12 million in stolen funds cited in
the 90-page superseding indictment was not explained.
   ``I don't know how this helps or hurts the government's case. I
suppose they're refining the charges because they suppose the
leading defendant will not be available,'' Marcos attorney John J.
Tigue said.
   The defense has contended that Marcos, 71, who suffers from
heart, lung and kidney ailments, is dying. He remains hospitalized
in Honolulu.
   ``We are as prepared as ever to defend against the charges in the
superseding indictment,'' Tigue said.

wasn't quite slick enough when caught trespassing on a closed

   Bon Jovi, 27, of Rumson, N.J., his girlfriend and another couple

said.
   They were given summonses for trespassing at Wollman Rink and
released within an hour, leaving plenty of time for Bon Jovi to
perform at a sold-out concert Friday night at the Nassau Coliseum.
   A spokesman for the group said Bon Jovi, who was booked under his
real name, John Bongiovi, and the rest of the band were off Thursday
night and Bon Jovi and his friends left their room in the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel to take a carriage ride in Central Park.
   When they couldn't find a hansom cab, they decided to go ice
skating in their shoes and sneakers.

<HEAD>Vice President Decries `New McCarthyism' in Tower Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, saying Americans
``won't condone a new wave of McCarthyism,'' harshly criticized some
of his former Senate colleagues over the failed nomination of John
Tower to be secretary of defense.
   ``I think virtually every objective observer of Senate
proceedings in this matter has been deeply troubled by the `raw
sewage,' as one Republican senator termed it, that has spilled into
the Senate chamber in the form of excerpts from FBI reports and
unsubstantiated anecdotes repeated for public consumption,'' Quayle
said in a speech in Indianapolis Friday.
   ``Everyone understands this is not politics as usual, that this
is trial and conviction by rumor and is a violation of the standards
of decency,'' said Quayle. ``We will not condone a new wave of
McCarthyism in this country.''
   Tower, burdened by reports of alcohol abuse and womanizing, was
rejected by the Senate as secretary of defense 53-47 Thursday. On
Friday, President Bush announced he selected Rep. Richard Cheney,
R-Wyo., as the new nominee for defense secretary.
   Asked about Quayle's remarks, Bush said in Washington: ``I
haven't seen what he said so I can't tell you whether he speaks for
me. I speak for myself. He speaks for himself.''
   However, Bush said he understands why Quayle feels the way he
does.
   In Washington, responding to Quayle's remarks, Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., said: ``I fought Sen. Joe McCarthy in the 1950s,
when Dan Quayle was still in kindergarten. I can inform the vice
president that he is using the same tactic Joe McCarthy used:
guilty-by-association.''
   Three times during his 25-minute speech, Quayle said the Tower
debate recalled the 1950s, when Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy of
Wisconsin used innuendo and trumped-up charges to accuse people of
having ties to communism.
   Quayle, a 42-year-old former Indiana senator making his first
trip home since becoming vice president, said allegations based on
rumor and innuendo shouldn't be used to tear down the reputation of
a public figure.
   Asked at a news conference if he believed a Senate debate on one
public figure amounted to a trend toward McCarthy tactics, Quayle
said, ``What I'm doing is just putting out a warning that if they're
going to rely on this kind of information for denying people a
position in the cabinet, we will not condone it nor will the
American people.''
   Quayle, speaking to 1,500 people at a luncheon meeting of the
Economic Club of Indianapolis, also said the rejection of Tower's
nomination signals a legislative attack on the power of the
presidency.
   ``Why has the Tower affair evoked such intense feelings?'' Quayle
said. ``I think it's because every Republican senator understands
that it is not just the Bush administration that is under attack. It
happens to be the constitutional prerogatives of the executive
branch.''
   Quayle said he had never ``encountered such anger and bitterness
in the Senate chamber'' as he did Thursday.

   Experts tried to delete a skunk from the
city schools' computer services building, but the critter appears to
have won by a nose.
   Jerry Cavatta, director of data services, said the skunk was
discovered about three weeks ago. School district officials tried a
deodorant, but that smell mixed with the skunk's odor and only made
things worse, Cavatta said.
   Employees complained of nausea, headaches and sinus problems, and
productivity dropped, he said.
   ``Finally ... I said, `That's it,' and we moved everyone out,''
Cavatta said earlier this week.
   The district also has tried trappers, animal experts from New
Mexico State University and exterminators, but he said all were
skunked.
   ``I would never have believed one skunk would disrupt a computer
center,'' Cavatta said.
   Cavatta said he thinks the skunk may be caught in a trap placed
in the crawl space under the building, which contains computer
programmers' labs and support services.
   He said the seven employees, office supplies, furniture and
equipment will be moved to a maintenance warehouse. Cavatta said the
offices needed to be moved anyway because the skunk-occupied
building was old and crumbling.

<TEXT>
   Christian units of the Lebanese army
clashed today with Syrian-backed Moslem militias in Beirut's
abandoned commercial district.
   Police said no casualities were reported from the exchanges of
machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades. The sporadic battled
erupted late Friday and continued intermittently into this morning.
   Hostilities broke out Wednesday between Christian army units and
Druse militiamen in hills southeast of Beirut and spread to Beirut's
bomb-scarred old commercial district straddling the city's harbor.
   By police count four people were killed and 15 wounded in the
escalation of tension, which followed a decision by Christian army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun to prevent commercial ships from docking
at militia-run ports.
   Aoun's naval force has seized at least two commercial ships
heading to a port south of Beirut run by Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militia.
   Aoun's move aims at stripping the private armies of their revenue
which they make mainly from the illegal ports.
   But this step was rejected by Jumblatt and other Syrian-backed
Moslem leaders, who vowed to bombard Beirut port in retaliation.
   Aoun also heads the Christian cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government.

<HEAD>Sihanouk To Send Envoy To Meet With Hun Sen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk today said he would send an envoy to Paris to meet with
Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, the prelude to possible peace
talks.
   Hun Sen had requested last week that such a meeting be held in
order to prepare for a Cambodian summit involving the Vietnam-backed
government and the rebel groups fighting to overthrow it.
   Hun Sen also requested the participation of the two other
guerrilla factions. ``There are elements that show that a
fundamental agreement is possible,'' he said in a letter to Sihanouk.
   Sihanouk responded by saying he would send the director of his
cabinet and another representative.
   In a related development, Sihanouk announced he would meet on
Sunday in Beijing with the leaders of the two other guerrilla
factions, Son Sann, a Western-leaning politician, and Khieu Samphan,
of the Khmer Rouge.
   He said the meeting would ``take all measures to reinforce the
union, solidarity, cooperation and mutual support of the three
armies of the resistance.''
   The sometimes fractious alliance will probably attempt to forge a
unified platform to take to Paris.
   The new developments came several weeks after a regional meeting
on the decade-old conflict ended without result in Jakarta,
Indonesia.
   At the meeting, the resistance coalition and Hun Sen's government
disagreed on the formation of a government after the withdrawal of
the Vietnamese army, which has occupied the country since 1978. They
also are deadlocked about a mechanism for monitoring the troop
pullout.
   Vietnam, with the aid of the Soviet Union, invaded the
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in late 1978. An
estimated 70,000 Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia. Vietnam has
said that it will withdraw its troops by September if the four
warring parties can arrive at a political solution.
   The Khmer Rouge killed about one million people when they ruled
Cambodia from 1975-78. The Vietnamese invasion drove them from
power. Still, they remain militarily the strongest of the guerrilla
groups.
   Cambodian guerrillas, meanwhile, reportedly recaptured a major
base, a Thai military officer in Bangkok said today, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Son Sann's Khmer People's National Liberation Front retook Ampil
camp in an early morning attack on Monday, the source said.
   Vietnamese forces seized Ampil in January 1985 as part of a
four-month offensive in which they toppled every major guerrilla
stronghold along the Thai-Cambodian border. Ampil is along the
central sector of the border.
   Resistance radio ``many'' enemy soldiers were killed, but gave no
figures.

   Six police officers from a black
homeland have been sentenced to prison in the killing of Eric
Mntonga, a black activist who died after a brutal interrogation.
   Mntonga's body was found in the nominally independent homeland of
Ciskei on July 25, 1987. A day earlier, according to testimony, he
was assaulted during interrogation at a Ciskei police station. No
testimony was offered that Mntonga, 35, had committed any offense.
   Two generals from Ciskei's security police unit, who were accused
of ordering a cover-up after being informed of Mntonga's death, were
sentenced Friday to two-year prison terms.
   Sentences ranging from four to 12 years were issued to four other
policemen, including a major and a colonel. They were convicted of
culpable homicide and defeating the ends of justice.

   A couple was awarded $600,000 by a jury
that ruled doctors at a university hospital acted recklessly in
removing organs from the couple's brain-dead son without permission.
   The Monongalia County Circuit Court jury deliberated for just
over two hours Friday before awarding Ronald and Carolyn Crawford of
New Freeport, Pa., $500,000 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in
punitive damages.
   The Crawfords had asked for $400,000 in their lawsuit against the
state Board of Regents, which ran the hospital _ then called West
Virginia University Medical Center, now WVU Hospitals Inc. _ at the
time of Adam Crawford's death on July 27, 1984.
   ``For once in my life, I've seen justice done,'' said Mrs.
Crawford, a 44-year-old coal miner. ``I can't tell you how happy I
am.''
   ``I would have won even if they didn't award us anything,'' added
Crawford, 48, a disabled former truck driver.
   ``That hospital will never do anything like this again. That's
all I wanted from the beginning.''
   George McLaughlin, a Wheeling attorney who represented the
regents, declined comment.
   Adam Crawford, 17, became ill July 19, 1984, while playing
basketball at a camp near Waynesburg, Pa. He was taken to the WVU
Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead eight days later after
suffering a brain aneurysm.
   The Crawfords denied the contention by hospital officials that
the couple had given their permission to remove the youth's organs.

<HEAD>Moslems Don't See Need To Disrupt `Satanic Verses' Reading</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Arab students who helped sponsor a public
reading of ``The Satanic Verses'' say they may not like author
Salman Rushdie, but they want to show that not all Moslems support
Ayatollah Khomeini's death decree against him.
   About 300 people attended Friday night's reading and panel
discussion on the University of Iowa campus. Twenty-five people read
two-minute selections from the book that many Moslems claim
blasphemes their faith.
   Wan Hasni, a member of the Iowa City Islamic Society and a
statistics student, said he and other Muslims attended the session
at the Iowa Memorial Union ``to hear the views, the feelings of
others in the American community have about this book.''
   ``A demonstration is appropriate if we need one. But it would
have served no purpose to disrupt the reading,'' he said.
   Saadi Simawe, a representative of the Arab Students Association
who organized the event, said the reading aimed to demonstrate that
not all Moslems support Khomeini's action.
   ``Fanaticism is always an aspect of insecurity,'' Simawe said.
``I read the Koran, I respect the prophet. I think Islam is a great
religion if taken personally. Once you are going to impose it on
others, it is very dangerous.''
   ``The Koran is not fragile, it is not a (blade) of grass that you
can destroy it by a book. It is a living book,'' said Simawe, a
doctoral student from Iraq studying English and African-American
World Studies.
   Bill Fuhrmeister, director of security at the university, said a
handful of officers stood guard at the reading in case of
disruptions or violence.
   But the only signs of protest were two Islamic Society members
who quietly held large posters defending Iran's order that Rushdie
be killed.
   ``Freedom of speech does not mean you can insult one-fifth of
earth's population,'' said a sign held by Mubarak Al-Ajmi, also a
student at the University of Iowa.
   ``If someone insults your family, you would stand up and do
something about it. Well, what Rushdie has insulted is my religion,
which means more to me than even my family,'' Al-Ajmi said.
   Mahmoud Rizig, president of the Iowa City Islamic Society, said
he urged his group's members to attend the reading and carry protest
signs but not disrupt the event.
   Rushdie, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family in
India, has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Iranian clerics
offered a $5.2 million reward for his death.
   The Writers' Workshop and the International Writing Program at
the university sponsored the reading along with the Arab Students
Association, the General Union of Palestinian Students, the Indian
Students' Association and the Pakistani Students Association.

<HEAD>Rebel Interim Government Meets In Afghanistan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SHOAWI, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel leaders who have formed an
interim government held their first Cabinet meeting inside
Afghanistan and said they would soon begin planning national
elections.
   The guerrillas met Friday in eastern Paktia province at a rebel
training base about seven miles from the Pakistan border.
   The alternative government, announced in February by
Pakistani-based Afghan rebels, is intended to take power if the
Soviet-backed communist regime in Kabul falls.
   ``This is the first meeting in a free atmosphere inside
Afghanistan,'' rebel leader Rasul Sayyaf, and the designated prime
minister of the guerrilla government, said during a news conference
in a hillside bunker.
   Hundreds of rebels armed with assault rifles stood guard.
Guerrilla forces lined the rocky hills and scanned the sky for enemy
airplanes or missiles.
   The calm was broken once by a 10-second burst from a hilltop
anti-aircraft gun.
   President Najib, who leads the Kabul government, on Friday asked
the United States and the Soviet Union to help stop fierce guerrilla
attacks on Jalalabad and other eastern cities, the British
Broadcasting Corp. said, monitoring Kabul radio.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported ``fierce
fighting'' around the Jalalabad airport this week, with the rebels
launching artillery shells, missiles and anti-tank guided missiles
at Afghan army positions. Government troops responded with
concentrated bombing.
   Government casualties apparently were heavy. Tass reported that
reinforcements ``making up for recent losses in manpower'' brought
the Jalalabad garrison to 15,000 troops.
   Tass also said rebel leaders have ordered a massive coordinated
shelling attack on all large cities and supply routes. It also
reported shelling of the Kabul airport.
   Attending Friday's rebel meeting were guerrilla leaders Nabi
Mohammadi, declared the interim president, Sayyaf and several other
Cabinet ministers. All belong to the seven-party rebel alliance
based in Peshawar, Pakistan.
   Afghan rebels based in Iran, mainly Shiite Moslems, so far have
rejected the interim regime which is composed mainly of Sunni
Moslems.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islami
rebels based in Pakistan, recently went to Iran in a new attempt to
persuade them to join in.
   Sayyaf said he was optimistic. ``The talks were hopeful,
promising,'' he said. ``We hope that in a week or 10 days our
problem will be solved.''
   Sayyaf declined to disclose details of Friday's cabinet meeting
but said they would meet again soon ``closer to Kabul.'' He said
that once all the cabinet posts are filled his government would
begin laying groundwork for elections.
   Soviet forces ended nine years of involvement in the Afghan war
on Feb. 15. They left the country's key cities in the hands of Kabul
government troops, but insurgents control the countryside.
   The rebels' interim government has pledged to hold national
elections within six months as a step toward forming a Parliament
and drafting the constitution of a post-war Islamic republic.
However, their efforts have been hindered by a power struggle
between moderates and fundamentalist extremists.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Clears Way For Simmons Execution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prison officials began preparing for the
execution of convicted mass murderer R. Gene Simmons after the state
Supreme Court ruled he was competent to waive his right to appeal
his death sentence.
   Friday's ruling clears the way for Simmons to become the first
person to be executed in Arkansas in 25 years.
   Simmons is to die by lethal injection Thursday for the December
1987 slayings of 14 family members. Their bodies were found in his
home and on his property near Dover, Ark., about 75 miles northwest
of Little Rock.
   Simmons, 48, was sentenced to death last month by Circuit Judge
John Patterson. He was convicted and sentenced to death last May for
two other deaths that occurred during his 1987 shooting rampage.
   The state Supreme Court ruling came one day after Simmons asked
the court to expedite its review of his competency to waive appeals
from last month's conviction.
   ``After a careful review of the record and exhibits, we affirm
the trial court's decision that the petitioner has knowingly and
intelligently waived his right to appeal,'' the court said in a
three-page opinion.
   Simmons asked that no one interfere in the case after an
execution date was set in his first trial. He said the sentence was
just, pleading, ``Let the torture and suffering in me end.''
   Edith Nesby, sister of Rebecca, Simmons' wife, told The
Associated Press by telephone from her home in Briggsdale, Colo: ``I
think this is one of the few times that Gene and I agree that
justice is being served.''
   David White, a spokesman for the state Correction Department,
said preparations for an execution usually begin about one week
prior to the execution date.
   White said prison officials have to ensure that the execution
chamber is in working order and that the director must choose
executioners and witnesses.

<HEAD>West Coast Dampened By Rain; Much Of Rest Of Nation Stays Dry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A subtropical flow of warm, moist air extended today from Hawaii
to the Oregon and northern California coasts, which were pelted by
showers and thundershowers while much of the rest of the nation
stayed dry.
   More than 2 inches of rain fell at Ben Lomond, Calif., as the
storms spread along much of the upper West Coast on Friday.
   Areas in the northern Sierra Nevada have received 4 inches of
rain since Thursday afternoon, and heavy rains have kept the
Sacramento River above the flood warning stage near Colusa.
   Winds gusted late Friday evening over western Nevada, with
clockings of 59 mph at Reno and to 64 mph at Stead, north of Reno.
   The remainder of the nation had predominately dry weather this
morning, but snowshowers fell in eastern upper Michigan. Sault Ste.
Marie, Mich., got another inch Friday night, giving the city a total
of 27 inches on the ground.
   Still, a sampling of spring continued across the central and
southern Plains, with temperatures in the low- to mid-60s from
western Kansas into the southern plains of Texas this morning.
   Record highs for the date on Friday were set in 34 cities in the
West and Southwest, and the nation's high was 97 at Tucson, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for rainshowers widespread in the Pacific
Northwest and scattered in northern and central California into the
northern Plateau; rain or snowshowers in Montana, northern New York
state and northern Vermont; an drainshowers widely scattered from
North Dakota into upper Michigan.
   Predicted highs were 30s and 40s from northern Montana across
North Dakota and Minnesota to northern Michigan, and from New York
state to northern New England; 70s in Florida, the central Gulf
coastal states and the lower half of the Mississippi valley; 70s and
80s from the southern Plains across the southern Rockies to Southern
California; 90s in southern Arizona, southwest Oklahoma and parts of
Texas.
   Elsewhere, highs were expected to reach the 50s and 60s.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 2 degrees at
Houlton, Maine, to 74 at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Sikhs Given Life Terms For Killing Religious Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Sikh men angered by the teachings of a
religious leader were sentenced to life in prison for killing the
guru as he spoke to hundreds of his followers.
   Rajinder Singh Batth, 39, and Mangit Singh Sunder, 26, wearing
orange turbans, chanted, ``God is great, victory to the God,'' as
they were led to their cells at the Old Bailey Central Criminal
Court.
   Judge James Miskin said the two took part in a ``disgraceful
pre-planned slaughter'' on Nov. 11, 1987, that left three people
dead and one wounded.
   Miskin sentenced both to life in prison and recommended Batth
serve a minimum of 30 years and Sunder at least 20 years.
   Prosecutor Jean Southworth said the gunmen were fundamentalists
whose target was Mahraj Dharshan Das, 34, who arrived in Britain in
1980 and led the breakaway Sikh sect called Shahkand Nanak Dhan,
which has 7,000 followers.
   The plotters decided to kill him for criticizing Sikh separatists
who want an independent state in India, she said. They also objected
to him being called a guru.
   ``What stuck in the gullet of some Sikhs was that Das was not
born a Sikh,'' Miss Southworth said.
   The prosecutor said Das traveled from his home in Birmingham to
Southall in west London, 100 miles away, to address hundreds of
supporters in a school.
   She said that as Das was about to answer questions, Batth and
Sunder walked toward him. Sunder fired a sawed-off shotgun at him
but missed and Batth then killed Das with a pistol shot through the
back of the head.
   His followers ran to tackle the gunmen, and Sunder drew a silver
pistol and killed Jaga Singh, 44. Batth shot wildly and killed
Satwan Singh Panesar, 41.
   Batth, who had pleaded innocent, was convicted of murdering Das,
the manslaughter of Panesar and wounding Dharan Singh Brimbrah, 53.
He was cleared of murdering Panesar and of attempting to murder
Brimbrah.
   Sunder, a factory worker, admitted taking part in the murder of
Das and the manslaughter of Singh.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says INS Memos Reveal Vice Among Mexican Authorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal probe has found evidence that
Mexican authorities extorted money from aliens headed for the United
States, leading some smugglers to alter their routes, a newspaper
reported.
   The alleged corruption was described in three internal U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service memos dated Feb. 22 and Feb.
23, The Brownsville Herald reported Friday.
   The memos were written by E.M. Trominski, INS district director
in Mexico City, to the Office of Foreign Operations in Washington,
D.C.
   One memo quoted an INS special agent working in Matamoros, across
the border from Brownsville, as saying: ``The bus depot is being
worked by Mexican Customs and other agencies, all on the take. The
bribe situation has caused the smugglers to off-load groups outside
of Matamoros and to get them downtown by other means, avoiding the
bus station.''
   Border Patrol intelligence officers in South Texas and Silvestre
Reyes, sector chief in McAllen, failed to return repeated phone
calls.
   Verne Jervis, INS spokesman in Washington, said he was unaware of
any INS agents operating in Mexico. ``To do that, you have to get
permission of the host country,'' he told the newspaper.
   The memos addressed activities of INS anti-smuggling teams in 10
Mexican cities, Guatemala and El Salvador, detailing techniques used
by alien smugglers and steps taken by INS agents in Mexico to
infiltrate smuggling operations.
   ``Major smugglers are chartering buses'' to move aliens, one memo
stated. ``The buses reportedly stay away from the federal highways
because of fear of `ripoffs''' by Mexican authorities, using back
roads instead, it said.
   One memo said a group of 38 Guatemalans and 1 Salvadoran was
``ripped off in the amount of 5 M (million) pesos ($2,100) by the
Federal Highway police who then called the municipal police.''
   A cable from San Salvador ``had specific information regarding
alien smuggling by air from San Salvador to Tapachula (Mexico),''
one memo said. ``The information was specific, including names of
pilots and aircraft tail numbers.''
   Trominksi wrote, ``I gave my personal observation that, if true,
such an operation could not take place without some sort of
`official' help.''
   Two memos also reported that Mexican Immigration Director General
Susana Torres Hernandez was concerned that the recent policy to
immediately detain illegal aliens in South Texas might leave large
numbers of undocumented Central Americans stranded in Mexico,
straining the country's scarce social services.

<HEAD>North Korean Armed Forces Put On Alert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea today put its armed forces on alert
because of what it called the danger of war posed by the U.S.-South
Korea military exercises that begin next week.
   The North's official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in
Tokyo, said President Kim Il Sung issued the order and warned that
if the United States and South Korea ``dare provoke a war against
us, our revolutionary armed forces and entire people will turn out
as one in the fight to defend the sacred fatherland.''
   About 200,000 U.S. and South Korean troops are expected to take
part in the 10-day annual joint exercises called ``Team Spirit''
scheduled to begin on Tuesday in the South.
   North Korea has demanded a halt to the exercises, calling them a
preparation for a nuclear attack on the North. U.S. and South Korean
officials say the exercises are defensive and vital to South Korea's
security.
   North Korea has issued similar orders in the past at the time of
the annual exercises.
   ``The (North) Korean people love peace but do not want
confrontation and war,'' the news agency said. ``But we will never
allow any attempt of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean
puppet clique to threaten and provoke us at random.''
   South Korea estimates North Korea's military manpower at 870,000,
compared to 650,000 in the South.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South at the end of World War II in 1945, when U.S. and
Soviet troops ended Japan's colonial rule over the region. The two
Koreas have remained enemies since the 1950-53 Korean War.

   The pilot of a Braniff Airways flight
made an emergency landing and all 47 passengers slid down chutes
after people smelled gasoline on board _ but the odor was later
traced to a man's pants leg.
   Without warning from the pilot, Flight 796 to Orlando made an
abrupt 180-degree turn about 30 minutes after taking off from
Southwest Florida Regional Airport in Fort Myers on Friday,
passengers said.
   ``The stewardesses were all frantic. They kept running in and out
of the cockpit on our way back,'' said Trish Merkel of Fort Myers.
   Passengers said the plane flew so low returning to the airport
that cars below them looked almost life-size. And the plane's
landing was as abrupt as its turnaround, some said.
   ``I thought we had gone too far and overshot the runway the way
we stopped,'' said Eric Swanson, 20, of Chicago. ``He really hit the
brakes hard and stopped us fast.''
   Forty-seven passengers used emergency slides to escape. But
firefighters called to the plane realized within minutes that the
gasoline smell had come from a passenger's pants.
   ``Apparently one of the men on board had spilled some gas on
himself while he was filling up his car before the flight,'' said
Braniff spokeswoman Sandy Smith, who declined to identify the
passenger.

<TEXT>
   FBI investigators tried to determine whether
vengeful terrorists were behind the bombing of a van driven by the
wife of the USS Vincennes skipper who mistakenly ordered the downing
of an Iranian airliner.
   Sharon Rogers, 50, the wife of Capt. Will Rogers III, narrowly
escaped injury Friday when she got out of the van after it was
rocked by what sounded like two backfires. Moments later, a pipe
bomb explosion engulfed the vehicle in flames, authorities and
witnesses said.
   Concerned that terrorism may have penetrated America's borders,
the FBI began a massive investigation involving scores of
investigators, said Tom Hughes, special agent in charge of the local
FBI office.
   ``We're going to be working this with every available resource of
this division and other divisions if necessary,'' said Hughes.
   Ted Royster, assistant special agent in charge of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' Los Angeles office, said he has
assigned six ATF agents to help the FBI.
   ``They view this incident as an act of retribution against Capt.
Rogers for the incident in the Middle East,'' Royster said.
   A Justice Department source in Washington who spoke on condition
of anonymity said investigators suspect the bombing was the work of
terrorists. However, local FBI investigators would not confirm that
theory.
   ``We certainly do not rule out the potential retribution to Capt.
Rogers for his ... command in the Navy,'' Hughes said. ``But on the
same token this could have been perpetrated for some other reason
unknown at this time.''
   Mrs. Rogers received a threatening call last July, shortly after
the Iranian jetliner was shot down, from someone she guessed might
have been Middle Eastern, The New York Times reported today, quoting
an unidentified Pentagon official. The caller said, ``Are you the
wife of the murderer?'' frightening Mrs. Rogers into hanging up, the
newspaper said.
   An unidentified Justice Department source told The San Diego
Union that Rogers and his family received at least two telephoned
death threats from callers who said they were acting in response to
the jetliner's destruction.
   One of the calls was placed to Rogers at the San Diego Naval
Station the day before the December bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people, The Union reported
today.
   Rogers' reaction to the van bombing was one of disbelief,
according to a friend, U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery. Rogers hadn't expected
his family to be exposed to danger on the homefront, said Lowery,
R-Calif.
   Rogers said military personnel stationed abroad realize they're
in peril, but ``no one expects you have to be worrying about your
wives and kids back home,'' Lowery quoted Rogers as saying.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who also spoke with the couple,
quoted Mrs. Rogers as saying, ``Thank God this did not happen on
Thursday because (I) was carrying six children in the van that
morning.'' She teaches fourth grade at La Jolla Country Day School.
   Rogers was in command of the Vincennes, a guided-missile cruiser
based in San Diego, when it exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats
in the Persian Gulf last July 3. During the battle, an aircraft that
Rogers thought was an Iranian F-14 fighter appeared on the U.S.
warship's high-tech radar. After the plane failed to respond to
warnings on civilian and military channels, Rogers gave the order to
shoot it down.
   The aircraft was actually an Iranian Airbus A300, a civilian jet
wih 290 people aboard. All died when the plane was hit by a
Vincennes missile.
   Rogers later said he regretted the deaths but that his decision
was made in defense of his ship and crew. The skipper was backed by
the Reagan administration, which also decided to compensate the
victims' families.
   But after the shooting, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called
for an all-out war against the United States. Speculation after the
destruction of the Pan Am jetliner focused on whether that bombing
was in retaliation for the Vincennes' action.
   Mrs. Rogers was driving alone to school and was stopped at a red
light when the bomb exploded at about 7:45 a.m. Friday. The pipe
bomb, pieces of which were recovered, was planted on the underside
of the white Toyota van, police spokesman Bill Robinson said.
   An unidentified official told the Los Angeles Times that Mrs.
Rogers thought her van had been rear-ended when she heard the two
popping noises and got out to look for damage.
   ``She got out just as it blew,'' said Kurt Lent, a construction
worker.
   Lent, who watched the van explode, said he heard a pair of
backfires, separated by a 10-second interval, and then a loud
explosion.
   ``It went `Boom!' `Boom!', then `Bam!''' he said. ``It worked
real quick.''
   John Christy, a masonry contractor supervising a work crew near
the blast scene, said he ran over to the burning vehicle and saw a
woman standing near it.
   ``For what had just happened, she reacted (like) a real strong
type of person,'' he said. ``I called her husband, he came down here
maybe about four minutes later. They embraced and went from there.''
   The couple was taken to an undisclosed and protected location,
Navy spokesman Cmdr. David Dillon said. Their son, who attends
Colgate University, was notified and offered protection, the FBI
said.
   The Navy increased its security at the San Diego Navy base and
other facilities, Navy Chief Petty Officer Craig Huebler said. Other
Vincennes crewmembers and their families were notified and they were
urged to take whatever precautions they deemed necessary.
   The Vincennes returned from its six-month Persian Gulf deployment
last October. It remains in port and Rogers remains its skipper.

the Richter scale hit the area at 4:12 p.m. It was 25 miles below
ground in southern Ibaragi prefecture, about 60 miles northeast of
Tokyo.
   Earlier in the day, a weaker earthquake struck north of Tokyo in
Tochigi prefecture, the agency said.
   That quake registered 3 in the city of Nikko on the Japanese
scale that goes to 7. No Richter reading was available.
   The quake rattled windows and doors in Nikko, forecasters said.
   Agency officials said that quake's epicenter was 75 miles north
of Tokyo at a depth of six miles.
   In Turkey on Friday, an earthquake rocked the eastern Anatolian
provinces of Erzurum, Van and Kars, destroying some homes but no
causing no casualties, state radio reported.
   The broadcast said that quake, measuring 4.2 on the Richter
scale, hit the area at 10 a.m.
   It said the quake destroyed 10 homes and left cracks in the walls
of 120 houses in villages in Erzurum.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake. Each
increase of one digit represents a tenfold increase in strength. A
quake with a magnitudee of 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas and a quake registering 4 can cause moderate damage.
   The Japanese scale measures ground motion at particular locations.

   Police recovered a stolen Rodin sculpture
from the basement of a downtown building a day after arresting a man
for the theft.
   ``Mask of the Man with the Broken Nose,'' a 10-inch tall bust
done by Auguste Rodin 125 years ago and valued at more than $75,000,
was found Friday wrapped in brown paper under a tarpaulin hidden
beneath a sewer line in the basement, police said. It wasn't damaged.
   ``Isn't it wonderful? You never believe that it could happen,''
said Robert Montgomery Scott, president and chief executive officer
of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which oversees the Rodin Museum.
   ``The theft, you never want to have happen, but the recovery is
the really exciting thing.''
   The discovery came one day after police arrested Stephen W. Shih,
24. He was charged with stealing the bust at gunpoint on Nov. 23
after firing a warning shot and shackling three museum guards
together.
   Shih was awaiting arraignment on charges of robbery, theft,
unlawful restraint, simple assault and weapons offenses, Capt.
William Demski said.
   Police and FBI agents found the bust in the basement of the
building where Shih's mother lives. Police arrested Shih near the
building Thursday after receiving an anonymous tip linking him with
the theft.
   Police don't plan to charge Shih's mother, Capt. Thomas McGinty
said.
   The museum's insurer had offered a $10,000 reward for information
leading to the sculpture's recovery, but Scott said no one has
claimed it.

   Actor Sam Melville, who played Officer Mike
Danko on the early 1970s television series ``The Rookies,'' died at
his home of heart failure, his publicist said. He was 52.
   Melville died Thursday at his Hollywood Hills home, publicist
Susan Patricola said Friday. The actor had complained of chest pains
recently but otherwise had been ``the picture of health,'' she said.
   In ``The Rookies,'' Melville played a green and idealistic cop
dedicated to more humane methods of police work. The series was on
the air from 1969 to 1972.
   Melville had been a regular guest star on the old ``Gunsmoke'' TV
series. He also appeared in such motion pictures as ``Big
Wednesday'' and ``The Thomas Crown Affair.''
   Melville is survived by his wife, Annie, his mother and father
and two sisters.

<HEAD>Infants-Parents Reunited After Hospital Confirms Mothers Got Wrong
Babies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rosetta Kirks had been nursing her newborn son
for three weeks when she noticed he looked small. Then she realized
she'd been given the wrong infant.
   Today, she's back home with her real 9-pound son, Nicolas.
   ``I'm sure this is the right one,'' a beaming Ms. Kirks, 30, of
Inglewood, said Friday night as she cradled the boy. ``I'm just glad
to have my baby back.''
   Genetic tests completed earlier Friday confirmed Nicolas was Ms.
Kirks' son and that she had received the wrong infant when she left
the maternity ward at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center.
   ``Based on our own investigation and corroborating blood tests,
it appears that two infants were in fact discharged to the wrong
sets of parents,'' said Kaiser spokeswoman Janice Seib.
   The hospital was investigating the apparent mix-up and reviewing
its procedures, Ms. Seib said.
   ``Both families and infants have gone home with the right
people,'' she said. ``As far as we're concerned, that's it.''
   But the attorney for Ms. Kirks and Tommy Milligan, the father,
told reporters he will work to see such mix-ups don't occur again at
Kaiser.
   ``Something's wrong or faulty. Nobody should be put through what
those people have been put through. The hospital shouldn't have done
that,'' said attorney Jerome J. Eisenberg.
   The other parents, identified as Nicholas and Firdowsa Amad
Mallet of Baldwin Hills, couldn't be reached for comment. Hospital
officials said they wanted privacy.
   Both babies were born at Kaiser on Feb. 11.
   Ms. Kirks became suspicious last Sunday when she looked at a
photograph taken just after her son's birth and noticed the infant
she was caring for seemed smaller, said Gene Murphy, a spokesman for
Eisenberg.
   ``That baby had chubby cheeks, and the one she had at home had
`itty bitty' cheeks,'' Murphy said.
   Ms. Kirks' son was 21 inches long and weighed 9 pounds, 3 ounces
at birth, said Shelly Shellmire, another spokesman for Eisenberg.
The baby Ms. Kirk had gone home with initially was 18 inches long
and weighed 6 pounds, she said.
   ``She got nervous,'' Shellmire said. ``She went to the dresser
and got the baby's arm band and discovered that it had a different
name on the arm band.''
   The mother then took the baby back to Kaiser and asked for her
son.
   Blood typing, chromosome studies and DNA typing confirmed the
babies' identities.
   Hospital officials said they wouldn't speculate how the mix-up
occurred until the investigation was completed.
   ``The policies and procedures that we have in place at this time
are in accordance with numerous regulating and governing agencies.
We are confident that they are in every way adequate and
appropriate. We are reviewing adherence to those policies,'' Ms.
Seib said.

<HEAD>Main White Church Declares Apartheid A Sin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main church of the ruling
white Afrikaners for the first time has declared apartheid a sin and
expressed guilt over its role in promoting racial segregation, a
church leader said today.
   The black and mixed-race branches of the Dutch Reformed Church
praised the admission, but said the mother church must act to bring
down apartheid.
   ``We confess with humility and sorrow the participation of our
church in the introduction and legitimation of the ideology of
apartheid and the subsequent suffering of people,'' the white branch
of the Dutch Reformed Church said.
   ``(Apartheid) cannot be accepted on Christian ethical grounds,
because it contravenes the very essence of reconciliation,
neighborly love and righteousness,'' it said.
   It is the most explicit condemnation of South Africa's system of
legal race discrimination made by the white branch of the church. In
1986, the church reversed its decades-old support of segregation and
said apartheid was a mistake, but stopped short of calling it a sin
or heresy.
   The statement was released late Friday after a weeklong meeting
between the white and black and mixed-race branches of the church.
   The black and mixed-race branches welcomed the statement, but
said strong differences with the mother church remain.
   ``It is encouraging that there are ministers in the (white) DRC
that call for fundamental and comprehensive changes,'' said the
black and mixed-race churches. ``But it is vital that they should
embark on acts of liberation within church and society.''
   They called on the white church to condemn specific apartheid
laws and ``develop a theology counteracting apartheid.''
   Piet Roussouw, chief executive of the white church, said today
such issues would be addressed at a meeting next week.
   ``The important thing is that we are working together to address
the problem of discrimination and suffering,'' Roussouw said.
   The Dutch Reformed Church is by far the largest and most
influential church among South Africa's 5 million whites. It counts
President P.W. Botha and virtually all his Cabinet ministers among
its congregants, giving it considerable influence in national
policy. About 1.1 million of the nation's 28 million blacks are
members of the black branch, and 680,000 of the 3 million mixed-race
people belong to their branch.
   In 1986, the white church opened membership to all races, but few
non-whites responded. There are a handful of white church ministers
who serve black congregations, and a few blacks occasionally attend
services in churches of the white branch.
   The church provided the scriptural foundations for apartheid when
the governing National Party came to power in 1948 and began
codifying racial segregation. D.F. Malan, the prime minister from
1948-54 when most apartheid laws were enacted, was a minister in the
church.

   Discovery's countdown was put on hold
for seven hours today, but NASA said the delay should not affect the
space shuttle's scheduled launch on Monday with a crew of five.
   Most of the holdup was blamed on gusty winds up to 30 mph that
buffeted the launch pad Friday and prevented workers from sealing up
the engine compartment and removing work platforms.
   NASA had planned to clear the pad at midnight to load propellants
into the shuttle's power-producing fuel cells. That activity did not
start until 7 a.m. today.
   But NASA said the countdown has 37 hours of hold time built into
it to allow for such contingencies. With seven hours lost, it still
had 30 remaining.
   Liftoff is set for 8:07 a.m. Monday.
   After four years of waiting, the five astronauts say they are
more than ready to go.
   ``We've had a lot of ups and downs and a lot of frustrations over
those years, but this crew has held up incredibly well. ... We're
certainly ready to go,'' the commander, Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats,
said Friday as the five arrived here to make final preparations for
flight.
   The crew originally had been assigned in 1985 to fly a 1986
mission, but those plans were interrupted by the Challenger
explosion that killed seven astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Noting the winds after the astronauts flew here from their
training base in Houston, one of the crew members, Marine Col. James
F. Buchli, commented to reporters, ``God willing, and if the weather
is good, we'll leave Florida for a real adventure on Monday.''
   The others are Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, Marine Col. Robert
C. Springer and Dr. James M. Bagian, a physician.
   They are to make the third post-Challenger shuttle flight, the
first of seven missions planned this year as NASA moves toward a
goal of routine, once-a-month launches by 1992.
   During five days in orbit, the crew will release a $100 million
communications satellite and conduct medical and science experiments.

<TEXT>
   The Socialist International, an
organization of left-wing political and government leaders,
denounced the Czechoslovak government's crackdown on dissidents.
   In the past month, at least 12 activists have been convicted in
Czechoslovak courts on a variety of charges.
   During Friday's closing session of a two-day conference, former
West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, president of the Socialist
International, praised moves toward reform in some East bloc
countries.
   But he criticized Czechoslovakia for its treatment of dissidents.
   ``I would like to express our deep concern in view of the
persecution to which dissidents are being subjected in
Czechoslovakia,'' Brandt told reporters.
   He also called for authorities to release playwright Vaclav
Havel, the country's leading human rights campaigner.
   Havel, whose works are banned in his country, was convicted last
month of incitement and obstructing police after participating in
demonstrations. He was sentenced to nine months in prison.
   Brandt also said the Socialist International planned to hold a
``fact-finding'' meeting on the Middle East in Brussels, Belgium in
May.
   ``We hope members of the U.N. Security Council will be present as
well as representatives from Israel, and Palestinians,'' he said.
   He did not say whether the Palestine Liberation Organization
would be invited. Israel considers the group a terrorist
organization and refuses to participate in peace talks with it.

   Actor Carroll O'Connor, best known for his role as
blue-collar bigot Archie Bunker in television's ``All in the
Family,'' underwent heart bypass surgery today.
   The surgery was ordered Friday after a routine physical
examination at Emory University Hospital indicated the need for a
coronary artery bypass operation, Maggie Begley, the actor's
publicist, said in Los Angeles.
   Hospital officials announced this morning that O'Connor's surgery
had begun; further details on his immediate condition were not
available.
   The 64-year-old O'Connor, now the star of ``In the Heat of the
Night,'' was admitted Friday to the hospital for a coronary
angiogram.
   ``The angiogram was requested because of a positive stress test
during a routine physical examination by his physician in Covington,
Ga., where Mr. O'Connor has been filming,'' spokeswoman Judy Smith
said in the statement.
   O'Connor, who stars as Police Chief Bill Gillespie on NBC-TV's
``In the Heat of the Night,'' was accompanied to the hospital by his
wife, Nancy.
   ``Carroll is in great spirits and is resting comfortably,'' she
said Friday night.
   David Gerber, chairman of MGM-UA Television, the show's
producers, said studio officials would meet this weekend to
determine how the program would deal with O'Connor's hospitalization.
   Gerber said, however, that production of the popular show was
proceeding as usual. He said 18 of the planned 22 episodes already
had been completed.
   ``All in the Family'' was bounced from network to network and
went through several pilots before CBS-TV finally put it on the air
in January 1971.
   O'Connor played Archie Bunker in the 1970s hit ``All in the
Family,'' a trailblazing comedy that took a satirical look at
bigotry.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Enos Nkala has resigned
from the Cabinet over his involvement in black market sales of motor
vehicles.
   He is the second Cabinet minister to quit since a commission
began investigating sales of locally assembled vehicles to senior
government officials who allegedly sold them at illegally inflated
prices.
   Nkala told a three-member commission Friday that he handed his
resignation to acting President Simon Muzenda the previous day.
   To thunderous applause from the packed High Court room, Nkala
said he did this ``when it became clear to me what was going to
happen here, and to show you the gravity with which I treat the
matter.''
   Earlier, Nkala had testified to the commission that his wife,
Thandiwe, had sold a Toyota Cressida on his behalf for the statutory
price of $14,500. But the buyer and Mrs. Nkala on Thursday testified
the car actually was sold illegally for $45,000.
   Nkala told Judge President Wilson Sandura he also has tendered
his resignation from all posts in the governing Zimbabwe African
National Union. As treasurer, Nkala was fourth in the party
hierarchy.
   The minister told the judge that Muzenda had not accepted his
resignations immediately, but was holding them for President Robert
Mugabe's return from a visit to Europe.
   Frederick Shava, the minister of state for political affairs,
resigned Tuesday after admitting he lied to the commission.
   He was the first casualty of the commission instigated by Mugabe
to investigate irregular sales of cars by a local assembly plant to
politicians, military chiefs, civil servants and business executives.
   He also is the first government minister to resign under a cloud
since Mugabe led the white-ruled British colony of Rhodesia to
independence as black-governed Zimbabwe nine years ago.
   The ministers' departure strengthens many critics' charges that
high-level corruption is widespread.
   Shava and Nkala were among six ministers to testify before the
commission about buying cars and trucks from Willowvale Motor
Industries Pvt. Ltd. and then allegedly selling them for fat profits
above fixed retail prices.
   Zimbabwe has a brisk black market in vehicles which are in short
supply because of foreign currency shortages.
   The other ministers denied any wrongdoing.

   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown
told his party today to carry on its debate about the role of
government and be ``firm about the future of our party and our
country.''
   Brown spoke to a meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council at
which party leaders debated how to break their presidential campaign
losing streak.
   ``For the first time in a long time we are thinking big,'' said
Brown. ``We are acting like a party that believes in sensible
government.''
   The party chairman said Democrats ``are also acknowledging that
we understand the limits of government and the responsibilities of
prudent stewardship of government.
   ``If we carry forward this debate vigorously, we can be firm
about the future of our party and our country because in the thick
of this debate lies the seeds that will grow into our party's next
national victory.''
   The difficulty Democrats are having framing a message that will
appeal to the middle class without alienating poor and minority
voters became clear at the DLC meeting Friday when Jesse Jackson
sparred with party leaders who view him as trying to take the party
in the wrong direction.
   ``The issue is not just who leads us, but who needs us,'' Jackson
told the meeting.
   He urged the Democrats to declare their support for striking
Eastern Airlines workers.
   ``If we don't show those workers we're on their side we're
missing something big,'' Jackson said.
   But Sens. Charles Robb of Virginia and Sam Nunn of Georgia made
it clear they want the party to aim its message more to the middle
class.
   While acknowledging that ``we can't take our base for granted,''
Robb said Democratic candidates have to convince voters that they
believe in a strong defense and firm measures against crime.
   He said one reason Democrat Michael Dukakis carried only 10
states in the 1988 presidential election was that ``the American
people did not view him as credible.''
   He praised Jackson's eloquence and said that if the two-time
candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination would ``deliver
our message, there is no question in my mind we can carry the day.''
   But, Robb continued, the Democrats must ``help Jesse get that
message straight.''
   Nunn said he agreed with Robb and added that he and Jackson
``have some very fundamental differences in philosophy.''
   The Georgia senator said he acknowledged that Jackson was ``one
of the people in the country who has the largest following and the
people who support him are an extremely important element in the
Democratic Party.''
   He said that any Democratic presidential candidate must be able
to bridge the different groups championed by Jackson and more
conservative Democrats.
   The political assessments heard by the conference were
unrelievedly gloomy.
   ``Democratic support is hemorrhaging in the heart of the
electorate,'' said Nunn, the current chairman of the DLC.
   ``A party in exile,'' was how Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the
party's 1988 vice presidential candidate, described the Democrats'
status as a national party.
   ``The Democratic Party has lost the ability to sustain a
presidential majority based on a progressive agenda,'' said William
Galston, former issues adviser to Walter Mondale's presidential
campaign in 1984 and now a professor at the University of Maryland.
   ``Rather than facing reality, we have embraced the politics of
evasion,'' Galston said. ``The result has been repeated defeat. And
if we do not stop and learn and change, we will keep on losing.''
   Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, the state that gave Bush his greatest
margin of victory over Democrat Michael Dukakis, talked about ``the
McDonaldization of American politics,'' and said Americans ``are
electing to buy their hamburgers at the Republican stand.''
   Nunn cited the DLC's role ``as a catalyst for new thinking in the
party and the country.
   But he said the DLC's progress ``has been overshadowed by a
larger failure _ the collective failure of Democrats to reverse our
party's dismal record in national presidential elections.''

<TEXT>
   North Korea said today the trial of a woman who
confessed to planting a bomb on board a South Korean airliner that
disappeared in 1987 was an attempt to dampen South Korean desires
for reunification.
   ``We have already made it clear that we have nothing to do with
the incident,'' the North's official Korean Central News Agency said
in a report monitored in Tokyo.
   The report was the first North Korean reaction to the trial in
Seoul, South Korea, of a woman identified as Kim Hyon Hui.
   She has confessed to being a North Korean agent and placing a
bomb on the Korean Air Boeing 707 before it disappeared near Burma
over the Andaman Sea in November 1987. All 115 people aboard are
presumed to have died.
   The trial began Tuesday, and the North Korean news agency said
prosecutors ``only repeated the old plot full of contradictions
which they had used several times to shift the blame for the KAL
incident onto us in a far-fetched way.''
   It did not explain the contradictions.
   Through the trial, South Korean officials ``seek an aim of
emasculating the South Korean people's sentiments for
reunification'' with the North, the report said.
   After the plane disappeared, the woman and a companion, an
elderly man, were arrested in Bahrain. They attempted to commit
suicide by taking cyanide hidden in cigarettes. The man died, but
the woman recovered and was extradited to Seoul.
   The woman told the court that Kim Jong Il, son and political heir
of North Korean President Kim Il Sung, had ordered her to blow up
the plane.

   Yaacobi blamed the losses mainly on greater military spending, an
increase in army reserve duty, a drop in production and tourism, and
difficulties in attracting foreign investment, said spokewoman Naama
Henig.
   ``He also warned that the costs to the economy might be at the
same level this year,'' Ms. Henig said. Yaacobi, a member of the
left-leaning Labor Party, was economics minister until November,
when he became communications minister.
   The uprising-related costs nearly wiped out Israel's economic
growth, initially forecast at 2.5 percent, Israel radio quoted
Yaacobi as saying. Instead, Israel's $35 billion economy grew by 1
percent in 1988, considerably less than the 5 percent in 1987.
   In a related development, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was
quoted as saying today he decided to shift the burden of putting
down the uprising from reserve soldiers to regular troops and
specially trained border police units.
   ``We want to reach a situation where reserve soldiers serve a
maximum of 44 days a year, instead of many now serving 62 days,''
Rabin said on Israel radio.
   The interview was broadcast a day after the army shifted some of
its troops out of Gaza Strip refugee camps in an effort to reduce
tension and fatal clashes.
   The redeployment also came as Foreign Minister Moshe Arens left
for a 10-day visit to the United States where he was expected to
counter pressure to reduce friction in the occupied lands.
   Rabin denied that the redeployment was designed to appease the
United States, saying the main objective was to ``reduce the burden
on the reserve soldiers.''
   Paying for thousands of reserves is proving costly. The Defense
Ministry has estimated the cost of combating the uprising is about
$14 million a month.
   The uprising has also hurt tourism, with only about 1.3 million
tourists entering the country in 1988, down 14 percent from the
previous year. Israeli officials had expected 1988 to be a banner
year because of the state's 40th anniversary celebrations.
   Production was hurt because as many 30,000 of the 110,000
Palestinians employed in Israel have quit their jobs.
   At the same time, the sale of Israeli goods to the territories
fell 70 percent in 1988 to about $140 million, according to the
Industry Ministry.

<HEAD>Rushdie Novel Becomes Key Foreign Policy Factor</HEAD>

   The dispute resulting from Salman Rushdie's new
novel goes far beyond an argument over ethics and theology. It has
disrupted diplomacy and global trade, pitted Western notions of free
speech against Islamic fervor, and added a frightening element to
the issue of foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Unlike previous episodes in the West's rocky 10-year relationship
with Iran, the crisis over ``The Satanic Verses'' seems to offer no
room for compromise.
   ``Is this a religious conflict, a political conflict or a little
of both?'' mused Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway,
one of 15 Western countries that recalled their ambassadors from
Iran in protest of the death order.
   ``How can we meet the Iranian problem without compromising our
basic principles, while avoiding escalation and the danger of
dramatic conflicts?'' he said.
   Stoltenberg's question sums up a dilemma facing Western
governments four weeks after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on
Moslems to kill Rushdie.
   Whatever the economic stakes, no Western politician can afford to
be seen condoning a murderous threat to artistic freedom. And no
Moslem leader can be seen to condone a book that allegedly
blasphemes Allah and Mohammed, his prophet.
   ``We're being confronted with an extreme demand. There's no
middle ground. It's not a thing on which there can be any
compromise,'' says Bernard Adamczewski, an analyst at the
London-based Institute for the Study of Terrorism.
   The crux of the problem, he says, is that Islam does not
recognize the concept of separation of religion and state and cannot
accept the Western argument that governments are powerless to
suppress books on religious grounds.
   Iranian religious leaders have offered a $5.2 million bounty for
the death of Rushdie, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem
family 41 years ago. The writer is in hiding under police guard.
   Moslem countries share a united sense of outrage over the book,
and most have banned it, but only Libya has supported the death
sentence unequivocally.
   Most Moslem governments balk at the death sentence, saying
Rushdie should at least be tried by an Islamic court.
   Britain has solid backing from its 11 European Economic Community
partners but fears this solidarity may waver. ``We have a beady eye
on the weaker brethren,'' Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave
said Thursday.
   Countries as mutually hostile as India and South Africa have
banned the book. Israel's chief rabbi has urged his country to ban
it ``so as not to strain Moslem-Jewish relations any further.''
   The Soviet Union must perform a delicate balancing act: it has
been asked by the United States and Britain to intercede with Iran,
but it is mindful of its own burgeoning Moslem population.
   In India and Pakistan, with their large Moslem populations, ``The
Satanic Verses'' is fraught with political danger, and anti-Rushdie
riots have killed at least 19 people.
   Western nations have universally denounced the death threat, and
the EEC countries, along with Austria, Norway, Canada and Sweden,
have withdrawn their ambassadors from Tehran in protest.
   Japan canceled a visit to Tehran by Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno.
   Britain, which in December was enjoying a long-awaited thaw in
its ties with Iran, has supplanted the United States as the West's
``Great Satan'' in Iranian terminology.
   Iran severed diplomatic relations with Britain on March 7, and
hopes dimmed for the release of three Britons held hostage in
Lebanon.
   Britain advised British citizens to leave Lebanon, and an Iranian
newspaper said the cut in ties will have a ``negative impact'' on
the fate of the British captives, who are believed held by
pro-Iranian extremists.
   The British tried to soothe Iranian anger by ackowledging ``The
Satanic Verses'' insulted Moslems and some Britons as well. But they
apparently see no more room for maneuver. On Wednesday the
government announced it was expelling up to 30 Iranians as security
risks.
   Britain's stance has already cost it a major oil technology trade
fair it was planning in Tehran this month.
   Industrialized countries vary in their willingness to reduce
economic ties with a nation poised to spend billions on
reconstruction following its eight-year war with Iraq.
   Even Britain says it doesn't want a trade cutoff.
   Trade with Iran is vital to some countries, and no one put it
more bluntly than New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, when he
said he wouldn't jeopardize $153 million worth of farm exports to
Iran and ``cause New Zealand sheep farmers to go out of business
because of a threat made to a bookwriter in London.''
   Domestic criticism made Lange back down and register a protest
with Iran, but he refused a British request to recall his ambassador
from Tehran.
   Probably the harshest retaliation came from West Germany, Iran's
biggest trading partner, which has suspended negotiations on export
credits reportedly totaling at least $1 billion.
   France advised its oil companies to reduce imports from Iran.

<TEXT>
   The Senate, burned by the bitter partisan
struggle over the nomination of John Tower as defense secretary, is
moving with lightning speed on the selection of Dick Cheney with
both Democrats and Republicans predicting quick confirmation.
   Almost as soon as President Bush announced his choice Friday,
Sen. John Warner, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, consulted with Sen. Sam Nunn, the chairman, and told
reporters hearings on the nomination would begin this week.
   ``They will probably be related to policy issues and thereafter
the issues of background and financial data will follow and as soon
as that material is completed, the committee will complete its
actions and send the nomination to the floor,'' said the Virginia
senator.
   The quick schedule, which Warner summed up in seconds, bears no
resemblance to the Tower confirmation proceedings that dragged on
for nearly seven weeks and ended with a rancorous debate that
divided the Senate.
   Tower, whose 24-year stint in the Senate included chairmanship of
the Armed Services Committee, was dogged by allegations of excessive
drinking, womanizing and conflict of interest for his lucrative
defense consulting work.
   Senate debate on the nomination was unprecedented because of its
detailed discussion of Tower's alcohol consumption, questions about
the use of material from a confidential FBI report and various angry
accusations and insinuations flying back and forth among the
debaters.
   A bit of anger lingered Friday when Vice President Dan Quayle
prepared a speech accusing Democrats of engaging in ``a McCarthyite
mudslinging campaign'' against Tower and waging an ``assault on the
powers of the presidency.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, commenting on the Cheney
nomination, got in a dig. ``This time it will be a confirmation, not
an execution,'' he said.
   Whatever the undercurrents of resentment, Bush and Senate
Republicans were talking quick confirmation of the 48-year-old
Cheney, a six-term conservative congressman from Wyoming who served
as White House chief of staff during the Ford administration.
   As minority whip, Cheney is No. 2 in the House Republican
leadership structure.
   ``I believe this will go very fast,'' Bush said in announcing the
nomination. ``I believe we will have smooth sailing.''
   The president said Friday he would order the FBI to speed up its
background checks to get the nomination moving. ```Too much time has
been wasted here,'' he said.
   GOP members of the Armed Services panel said they did not foresee
any roadblocks to confirmation and there was nothing from Democrats
to challenge that assessment.
   ``I do not know what possible skeletons could exist in that
closest,'' said Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop, a fellow Wyoming
politician.
   Warner called Cheney ``a wonderful, perfect nomination'' while
Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, No. 2 Republican on the Armed
Services panel, said the nominee is ``a man of integrity and
dedication.''
   ``He's widely respected in Congress and a first-rate choice for
quick confirmation,'' said Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va.
   ``He's a very able and impressive person,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth,
D-Colo., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``He's one
of the smartest people in Congress.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine said he was
``pleased that President Bush has moved quickly'' and added that
Cheney ``has served with distinction in the U.S. House of
Representatives since 1978.''
   The true gauge of Cheney's prospects will be Nunn, the powerful
committee chair who led the fight to defeat the Tower nomination.
The Georgia Democrat was reserved in his reaction, issuing a joint
statement with Warner that called Cheney ``well known and highly
respected by the members of the Senate.''
   Later Nunn told reporters, ``I know of no impediment to his
nomination.''
   Unlike the twice-divorced Tower, Cheney has been married for 28
years _ to Lynne Vincent of Caspar, Wyo. She is a well known
Washington figure herself, currently as head of the National
Endowment for the Humanities.
   Cheney is on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
and was a member of the House panel investigating covert arms deals
with Iran.
   Cheney's selection came as a surprise because he lacks defense
experience, but even Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California
didn't see that as a problem.
   ``I think Dick Cheney knows what one needs to know when one takes
over that post,'' Cranston said. ``He will learn a lot more detail
now. He is well aware of the broad concepts and as chief of staff at
the White House he had to know a great deal about national defense
matters.''

<TEXT>
   Since a recent stroke,
President P.W. Botha has lost his stature as the domineering master
of South African politics. Suddenly, he is depicted as a tragic
figure, clinging to power against the wishes of former loyalists.
   Those who have done Botha's bidding for a decade now are engaged
in a concerted campaign to push him into retirement. Botha signaled
his intention to fight back, but there has been a dramatic lack of
public support for the man whose tough tactics earned him the
nickname ``The Great Crocodile.''
   The result, for the moment, is a power struggle between Botha and
his heir apparent, Education Minister F.W. de Klerk.
   De Klerk took over as leader of the governing National Party when
Botha resigned that post Feb. 2, two weeks after his stroke.
   Since then, de Klerk has consolidated his support among
Nationalist members of Parliament and has made no move to disavow
reports he wants Botha to quit the presidency.
   Botha, 73, struck back last week by announcing he planned to
return to work March 15, two weeks earlier than expected. He gave no
indication he was considering early retirement or a power-sharing
arrangement with de Klerk.
   De Klerk and three senior party leaders emerged tight-lipped from
talks with Botha on Thursday. The talks were ``incisive'' and will
resume at a later date, de Klerk said.
   ``The Crisis Continues,'' said the front-page headline the next
day in Beeld, a pro-government daily.
   De Klerk briefed members of the National Party caucus about the
talks with Botha. Although sworn to secrecy, several legislators
were quoted anonymously in the press as saying there was almost
unanimous support in the caucus for de Klerk and widespread anger at
Botha's perceived intransigence.
   South African political correspondents reported many caucus
members blamed Botha's attitude on misleading information provided
by his inner circle of advisers during his recuperation. Because of
this misinformation, several reports said, Botha underestimated the
depth of caucus support for de Klerk and overestimated its loyalty
to the president.
   In the aftermath of the de Klerk-Botha meeting, there was
sympathy for the president among party officials, wrote Business Day
political reporter Mike Robertson, ``because, having been sheltered
by his personal staff, it was probably the first time he had been
confronted with the reality that virtually the entire caucus wanted
his reign to end.''
   But there is no evidence any such sympathy translates into active
backing. There have been appeals for Botha to be allowed to step
down with dignity, but there have been virtually no calls for de
Klerk to pull back and leave Botha in total command.
   There also are doubts about the president's health. Botha
indicated in his statement Thursday doctors feel he is ready to
resume work. But his left arm was trembling markedly during his only
post-stroke public appearance last month, and his daughter, Rozanne,
was quoted Friday as saying she was ``extremely worried'' about her
father's condition.
   De Klerk, 52, is widely viewed as more pragmatic and open-minded
than Botha, although he is not expected to push through radical
political changes. Many South Africans are seeking the transfer of
power in hopes it will change the mood in the country, with de
Klerk's relatively conciliatory approach replacing the sometimes
bullying demeanor of Botha.
   De Klerk's brother, Willem de Klerk, a former newspaper editor
who broke with the government because of his opposition to South
Africa's system of racial segregation, recently wrote a magazine
article assessing a possible de Klerk presidency.
   ``As a good negotiator, he is certain, within the system, to
defuse some of the tension that has accumulated under the Botha
regime,'' he wrote of his brother. ``He is by nature a democrat. .
.. He is fair, friendly and humble.''
   By contrast, the Johannesburg financial newspaper Business Day,
in an editorial Thursday, said Botha's imperious style had set the
stage for his current plight.
   ``Since his elevation to the presidency, he and his royal family
have been strutting and posturing like hereditary monarchs, holding
ridicule at bay only by the fear that he inspired,'' the editorial
said. ``The fawning around his feet was pitiful to see.''

   Salman Rushdie's new novel, ``The Satanic Verses,''
has cast a shadow over the foreign policies of many nations. Here,
at a glance, are some of the major repercussions of the novel:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IRAN _ Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini orders Rushdie put to death,
and clerics offer a $5.2 million bounty. The government severs ties
with Britain, and an Iranian newspaper says the cut will have a

   BRITAIN _ Rushdie remains in hiding following Khomeini's Feb. 14

Britons to leave Lebanon. A major British oil technology fair in
Tehran is canceled.

<TEXT>
   A trucker described by his family as a gentle
man driven to desperation by personal problems has been sentenced to
four years in prison for a car-ramming rampage that terrorized
motorists for 40 miles.
   Although a county probation report recommended that Charley Tom
Lee be placed on supervised probation, Superior Court Judge Judith
Chirlin sentenced him to state prison, saying his actions had
instilled fear and terror in drivers.
   She said some people had told her: ``This was the commuter's
greatest fear, as reliant as we are on our cars and the freeways.''
   Lee, 26, of Haltom City, Texas, pleaded guilty Nov. 18 to five
counts of assault with a deadly weapon. He has been jailed since the
May 18 incident in which about 30 cars were rammed but no one was
injured.
   He drove at speeds of up to 80 mph from Temple City to Los
Angeles before California Highway Patrol officers stopped him at
gunpoint on the Hollywood Freeway.
   In a letter to the judge, Lee apologized and said he still could
not explain the outburst.
   His mother, grandmother and wife testified that Lee was a
nonviolent, responsible family man before the incident.
   Lee's wife, Tammy, said he had been disturbed about being unable
to support his family adequately. His mother, Billie Lee, noted that
his father had attempted suicide several months before the rampage.

Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   'Twill be a grand St. Patrick's Day after all for millions of
Catholics who faced the disheartening possibility of eating their
cabbage and potatoes straight up.
   Some fellas named O'Connor and Quinn and a few of their pals have
decided to make a wee bit of an exception March 17 to the rule
forbidding Roman Catholics from eating meat on Fridays during Lent.
   The ``special dispensations'' granted by bishops in Irish
enclaves throughout the country in recent days will permit many of
the nation's 53 million Catholics to have their corned beef and eat
it, too.
   ``We're very grateful that (they) understand that fish doesn't
have any place in a good Irish stew,'' said Dorothy Cudahy, who will
be grand marshal of the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York City.
   Up until the 1960s, the Catholic Church banned meat on all
Fridays. It was a penitential practice in commemoration of the death
of Jesus Christ on a Friday ``and also in expressing sorrow for
one's sin,'' said the Rev. Michael Walsh, head of the Office of
Pastoral Research and Practices for the U.S. Catholic Conference.
   The rules changed in 1966 when Pope Paul VI issued a papal
document allowing church leaders in each country to establish their
own rules on doing penance.
   In the United States, bishops decided to encourage Catholics to
do other forms of penance most of the year, but kept the Friday ban
on meat during Lent, which runs from Ash Wednesday to Easter.
   ``The basic principle is that it is good for the soul to do some
sort of penitential practice,'' said Bill Ryan, deputy director of
the Office of Media Relations for the Catholic conference.
   But individual bishops still hold the right to grant special
dispensations, and that's just what many did after they realized St.
Patrick's Day falls on a Friday this year.
   They include Cardinal John O'Connor of New York; Archbishop John
Quinn of San Francisco; Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston; and their
counterparts in Chicago; Cincinnati; Buffalo, N.Y.; and Newark, N.J.
   The prelates have asked those who eat meat on St. Patrick's Day
to observe another day of abstinence or do some other additional act
of penance.
   Individual Catholics always remain free not to follow the fasting
regulations for ``just and serious cause,'' Walsh said, but the
bishops' action ``kind of eases everybody's conscience.''
   ``We have an old expression in the Latin _ Ecclesia est benigna
mater: The church is a kind mother,'' said Monsignor William
Stanton, pastor of a church in predominantly Irish South Buffalo.
``Her children are feasting, and why not?''
   One observer in San Francisco said Quinn was just a step ahead of
his flock with the dispensation.
   ``Sure, sure, sure, they'll all be eating corned beef, especially
in the places where it's free,'' said John Whooley, publisher of the
Irish Herald newspaper. ``The archbishop was wise to do that because
they'll all be eating it anyway.''
   A Cincinnati restaurant owner said there's only one item they
could have banned that would affect affect her business on March 17.
   ``Most people, as long as they can get green beer _ that's all
they care about,'' said Helen Russum, co-owner of the Crow's Nest on
the city's west side.
   Not everyone agreed with dropping the ban on meat.
   The Rev. Daniel Hurley, a campus minister at St. Bonaventure
University in western New York, said he would prefer the church keep
the centuries-old ban as a sign of reverence _ but he is not going
to be ``holier-than-thou'' about the whole thing.
   ``If it were my decision, I'd probably stick with it throughout
Lent,'' Hurley said. ``Since it isn't, I'll probably take advantage
of it.''

   A small twin-engine plane slammed into a
two-story building in a Lima suburb, killing the eight American
tourists and two Peruvians aboard, the U.S. Embassy said Saturday.
   The plane, owned by the privately owned Aerocondor airline,
crashed into a partially constructed building in heavy fog Friday
evening. Witnesses said the engines were sputtering before the plane
slammed into the building, which belongs to the University of San
Martin de Porras.
   The eight tourists and Peruvian pilot and co-pilot were killed,
the embassy said. A man at the construction site was injured, police
said.
   The embassy identified the Americans as:
   _ John Howe, 81, and his wife Barbara, 72, of Hagerstown, Md.
   _ Robert Fisher, 66, and his wife Ruth, 62, of Moorestown, N.J.
   _ Dorothy Menzies, 77, and her daughter, Virginia Fennel, 48, of
Hickory, N.C.
   _ Virginia Hall, 78, and her granddaughter, Mary Shuford, 28,
also of Hickory, N.C.
   Investigators have not said what caused the accident.
   An official for Aerocondor, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the plane was returning after having flown over the famous
Nazca lines, 250 miles southeast of the capital.
   The Nazca lines are giant pre-Columbian drawings on the desert
believed to represent a primitive calendar.

   Weeks of small-scale Tibetan protests,
arrests, tightened security and wild anti-Chinese rumors built up to
last week's violent clashes in Lhasa, according to Western and
Tibetan sources.
   They painted a picture of steadily mounting tension in Tibet's
capital and persistent acts of defiance by Buddhist monks and nuns
who have initiated most protests since Chinese troops entered Tibet
in 1950. The sources' identity and whereabouts cannot be revealed
for fear of reprisals.
   Tensions burst last week, they said, when Tibetans tried to
commemorate two anniversaries: a March 5, 1988, clash with police
that left 24 people dead, and a March 10, 1959, uprising against
Chinese rule in which hundreds died and Tibet's spiritual and
temporal ruler, the Dalai Lama, fled to India.
   The commemorations brought more bloodshed: 16 dead and more than
100 wounded by official count, many more by Tibetan count.
   Pressure began building shortly after a Dec. 10 clash, when
police fired on marchers, killing at least one monk and a Tibetan
child. Twenty days later, students from Tibet University held a
brief peaceful march to protest the police action.
   On Jan. 3, city education officials said students who even stood
on the sidelines of future protests would be expelled, according to
a copy of their order shown to The Associated Press.
   Buddhist monks at Lhasa's leading monasteries, meanwhile, decided
to boycott a major prayer festival because Chinese authorities broke
a promise to increase the quota of people allowed to become monks.
   The official media did not report the boycott. They said the
festival was canceled out of respect for the Panchen Lama, Tibetan
Buddhism's second-ranking religious leader who died of a heart
attack Jan. 28.
   The Panchen Lama's death led to new tensions. A rumor began
circulating that the overweight, 50-year-old monk was assassinated,
because days before he died he criticized Beijing's policies in
Tibet. No evidence was produced, but the rumor triggered a small
protest, Tibetans told an American traveler.
   Another rumor said Chinese plans to renovate the Potala in Lhasa
were an excuse to destroy part of the revered 17th century building.
The huge stone palace on a hill, Lhasa's most prominent feature, was
seat of Tibet's theocratic government. In recent years it has been
turned into a tourist site.
   On Feb. 3, monks at Lhasa's Sera Monastery hoisted the banned
snow lion flag over their buildings, where it flew all morning
without police action.
   Three days later, on Tibetan New Year, Lhasa residents woke to
see the nationalist flag flying over the Jokhang Temple, Tibetan
Buddhism's most sacred site. Pilgrims tossed white ceremonial
scarves to the roof.
   ``There must have been hundreds of scarves piled up by midday,''
said Steve Marshall, of New Orleans, who witnessed the silent
protest. The flag was taken down in the middle of the night.
   Four times in late February and early March, small groups of
monks and nuns walked around the Jokhang carrying a picture of the
Dalai Lama or chanting independence slogans.
   Tibetan witnesses and one participant said bystanders intervened
several times to hustle marchers away before they could be arrested.
   But the police also seemed anxious to avoid confrontation.
Instead, said one Tibetan, they photographed the marchers in order
to arrest them later. He reported seven arrests.
   Advance word about the March 5 protest, circulated among
Tibetans, indicated it also was planned as a small-scale event.
   The pattern broke when police opened fire.
   From then on, the Tibetans' anger turned on anything Chinese.
They vandalized their stores and stoned Chinese cyclists.
   Still unclear is why police shifted tactics.
   Martial law imposed midnight Tuesday remained in force Saturday,
with heavily armed soldiers manning checkpoints throughout the city.
   More anniversaries are coming. March 17 is the day the Dalai Lama
left Lhasa for India in 1959. On March 19 and 20, 1959, the Chinese
army used heavy artillery to suppress the uprising.
   Most protests have been the work of individual monasteries. There
is no evidence of a central resistance organization.
   The goals are simple: to express four decades of anger over what
is perceived as alien rule, and possibly win outside support. One
Tibetan source said protesters hoped the United Nations would open
an inquiry into Chinese human rights policies in the region.
   Independence remains a vague concept except among young,
Westernized Tibetans in India. None of the Lhasa protesters has
articulated goals beyond the return of the Dalai Lama.
   Even Tibetan college students inside China say they have not
considered how Tibet would be ruled if it were independent.
   ``We can't even talk about independence,'' said a 20-year-old
woman. ``There are too many Chinese and too few of us. What we want
is for the Chinese to understand our culture and stop discriminating
against us. If not, in a short while, there will be no more Tibet.''

<HEAD>Cash-Filled Garment Bag Could Cost Federal Judge His Black Robe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a crisp October morning, William Borders
drove out of a suburban motel parking lot with a garment bag packed
with cash and an FBI undercover agent beside him in the front seat.
   Minutes later, the high-living and well connected Washington
attorney was under arrest and headed down to the road to a five-year
prison term. But that was far from the end of the tale.
   After seven years, District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami is
still waging a stubborn fight to hang onto his black robe as the
Senate prepares for his impeachment trial arising from events of
that fateful day, Oct. 9, 1981.
   If convicted, the 52-year-old Hastings, Florida's first black
federal judge, would not face criminal penalties. He was acquitted
of conspiracy by a jury in 1983 and he claims that verdict should
have settled the matter.
   The outspoken Hastings, however, does stand to lose his seat on
the bench and his $89,500 salary if the Senate convicts him.
   ``This isn't some agriculture bill we're talking about,''
Hastings said in February following a Senate Rules Committee
session. ``This is my office.''
   The Senate this week takes up a Hastings move for dismissal of 16
of the 17 charges in the bill of impeachment approved Aug. 3 by the
House, 413-3. They say he plotted with Borders to obtain a bribe and
lied about it at the 1983 trial. Another count says he improperly
divulged data produced by a wiretap and thus torpedoed a federal
investigation.
   The Senate plans to hear arguments on Wednesday and make its
decision concerning dismissal of the charges on Thursday.
   Presentation of evidence, if it comes to that, will take place
later before a special Senate committee with videotapes of the
proceedings available for senators unable to attend the sessions.
When that will happen is unclear, but Hastings attorney Terence J.
Anderson says it should not happen at all.
   ``The Senate should ask itself, can a trial that is fair be
conducted?'' Anderson says. ``Is it feasible? Is it practical? is it
possible? And if the answer is no, the Senate should just say, we're
not going to do it, we're not going to take the time out from our
schedule and subject the man to this ordeal.''
   But both sides are digging in for weeks of skirmishing.
   Hastings has been going on Washington radio shows in recent weeks
and urging sympathizers to attend the Senate session.
   Hastings stands accused of conspiring with Borders to obtain a
$150,000 payoff from brothers Frank and Tom Romano of Miami who had
been convicted of skimming more than $1 million from a Teamsters
pension fund loan.
   In return, say authorities, Hastings planned to restore to the
brothers more than $1 million they forfeited because of their
conviction and guarantee them no prison time.
   The Romanos, however, both of whom have since died, had no
interest in paying a bribe.
   They did send a go-between to a meeting in a Miami paint and body
shop with Borders associate William Dredge, a North Miami antique
dealer. But the two brothers wanted no part of the proposed fix.
   That did not stop the FBI. Dredge, under indictment in a
Baltimore narcotics case and eager to please, was persuaded to
introduce retired agent H. Paul Rico to Borders under the name of
Frank Romano.
   Soon, Rico, masquerading as Romano, was asking Borders for some
gesture that would prove he really was working with the judge. They
hit on a deal in which Hastings would appear for dinner in the main
dining room of Miami's Hotel Fountainbleu at 8 p.m. on Sept. 16,
1981.
   Hastings did appear at the appointed hour but scoffs at the
notion that he did so as a signal in a bribe plot.
   It is not the only circumstantial evidence. Prosecutors claim
Hastings gave a coded signal he was about to fix the case when he
said in a wiretapped phone conversation with Borders: ``I'll send
the stuff to Columbia in the morning.'' Nonsense, says Hastings.
   About the only thing certain is that many of those involved spent
hours wandering through the Fountainbleu in the course of the
investigation.
   At one point, FBI agents acting on a Dredge tip followed Borders
to the Fountainbleu lobby where he met with Florida mob boss Santo
Trafficante, at the time a defendant in another case before Hastings.
   It was more than enough to raise eyebrows. At the time, Borders
was aprominent Washington criminal lawyer, a former president of the
National Bar Association and a member of the District of Columbia's
powerful judicial selection committee.
   He also was an effervescent high roller, who seemingly always
could arrange a suite at Washington's plush L'Enfant Plaza Hotel and
thought nothing of taking his girlfriend to Las Vegas for the Thomas
Hearnes-Sugar Ray Leonard fight for her birthday.
   ``During the term of President Carter,'' according to a 1987
House Judiciary Committee report, ``Borders became a very high
political advisor, primarily through the Democratic National
Committee.''
   Indeed, a testimonial dinner topped off by a moonlight boat ride
was planned for him on Oct. 9, the day he accepted a garment bag
packed with $125,000 in cash from Rico, still masquerading as Romano.
   As Borders pulled out of the parking lot and turned onto
Interstate 395, he was surrounded by FBI cars and he told Rico
glumly, ``We're busted.''
   Hastings, who had checked into the L'Enfant Plaza in advance of
the testimonial dinner, received word of the arrest and that FBI
agents were searching for him from another guest, Hemphill Pride, a
one-time law school classmate.
   The judge hastily packed his suitcase and returned to Miami,
where he was located later than night and placed under arrest.

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders from 24 nations today
signed a pact asking the United Nations to police efforts to curtail
ozone-destroying chemicals and other air pollutants.
   Those who signed the accord included King Hussein of Jordan and
presidents Francois Mitterrand of France, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
   The meeting, arranged by the Dutch government, followed an ozone
conference of 123 nations earlier this week in London. At that
session, 20 countries promised to join 33 nations that have already
agreed to halve emissions of ozone-destroying chemicals by the end
of the century.
   The United States and the 12-nation European Community have gone
further. They have pledged to try to ban the chemicals, called
chlorofluorocarbons, by 1999 if safe alternatives can be developed.
   The compounds have widespread use in aerosol spray cans and
refrigerators, as well as in the electronics and plastics industries.
   The new pact, billed as the ``Hague Declaration,'' says the
United Nations should be given authority to set and monitor air
pollution rules, according to a Western diplomat familiar with the
document's contents. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   However, the proposal would be an agreement in principle without
legal force on the nations that sign it, the diplomat said.
   He said the document does not specify whether there should be a
new U.N. body to fight air pollution or whether the new
responsibilities should fall to a strengthened U.N. Environment
Program, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya.
   Either way, he said, the United Nations would get authority to
``define standards to enhance or guarantee the protection of the
atmosphere and monitor compliance,'' the diplomat quoted the Hague
document as saying.
   The participants at the conference discussed the gradual
depletion of the delicate ozone shield that protects Earth from
cancer-causing solar radiation and the rise in global temperatures
known as the greenhouse effect.
   Government leaders at the Dutch gathering included West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and premiers Felipe Gonzalez of Spain,
Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden and Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway.
   The Hague document says the World Court should back up U.N.
efforts to control the chemicals, the diplomat said. But he
acknowledged that the court, the U.N.'s legal arm, depends on
voluntary compliance.
   He said details of the proposal will be worked out in the next
few months and a broader international accord on atmospheric
pollution is expected to be signed by October. Any changes in U.N.
authority would also need approval of the body's General Assembly in
New York.

<HEAD>Urban Poverty Seen Worsening and Escape Growing Less Likely</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Poverty in America's cities has grown more
persistent and concentrated over the last two decades and its
victims have less chance of escape, according to a report by the
National League of Cities.
   The study describes a changing face of poverty since 1970, with
the nation's poor more likely now to live in metropolitan areas and
concentrate in low-income neighborhoods.
   It said the proportion of children living in poverty has
increased and the likelihood of people climbing above the poverty
level has declined.
   ``Poverty in cities is changing in quality and intensity,'' the
report said. ``It is more persistent among particular households,
more concentrated within particular neighborhoods, and more isolated
from traditional avenues of escape.''
   The league released its report, ``Poverty in Cities,'' as nearly
3,000 municipal leaders gathered in Washington for the
organization's annual winter meeting, which runs through Tuesday.
   ``Both the figures and the trends are alarming,'' Alan Beals,
executive director of the National League of Cities, said in
releasing the report. ``Such conditions are devastating for those
caught up in it, especially children.''
   The report, an analysis and compilation of previous research,
said poverty in America declined through much of the 1970s, to a
rate of under 12 percent at the end of the decade. But a resurgence
brought the rate to more than 15 percent by 1985, and the average
rate for the years 1980 through 1987 was over 14 percent, the league
said.
   The portion of the nation's poor living in metropolitan areas
grew from 62 percent in 1979 to 70 percent in 1985 _ an increase of
7.6 million people, with the majority living in central cities, it
said.
   The report said the persistence of poverty _ that is, the length
of time a person remains poor _ has grown. It cited previous studies
of the proportion of urban poor in a given year who escaped poverty
the following year and said in the late 1960s, that figure was 32
out of 100.
   Called the ``escape probability,'' the figure rose to 37 out of
100 in the mid-1970s, meaning that poverty became less persistent,
but began declining and was 23 out of 100 by the early 1980s.
   ``There has been a substantial decrease in the chances that a
poor person will escape poverty within the following year,'' it said.
   An increase was also recorded in the proportion of poor residents
of big cities who live in neighborhoods that are classified as
extremely poor _ where at least 40 percent of residents live below
the poverty line. Among the 50 largest cities, the
concentration-of-poverty rate increased from 16 percent in 1970 to
24 percent in 1980 _ meaning nearly one-quarter of the large-city
poor lived in extremely poor neighborhoods.
   The report said poor neighborhoods of large central cities have
become increasingly isolated from the rest of the metropolitan
areas, with more clear differences in socioeconomic and physical
conditions.
   As more ghetto dwellers live in more isolated deprivation, their
opportunities for jobs, training and other means of climbing out of
poverty are reduced, it said.
   The study said blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whites
to live in extremely poor neighborhoods, and poverty among blacks
was more persistent than for other groups. More than 21 percent of
blacks living in big cities were persistently poor throughout the 10
years between 1974 and 1983, it said, compared to a rate of less
than 3 percent for non-blacks.
   The poverty rate among children, it said, grew from 16 percent in
1979 to over 20 percent in 1985, which it called ``a startling
increase.''
   The report was written by Mark Alan Hughes, assistant professor
at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. David Scheider is having a
difficult time practicing what he preaches when it comes to Middle
East hostage Terry Anderson.
   Scheider has been urging residents of Anderson's hometown in
upstate New York not to despair over the journalist's nearly four
years of captivity in Beirut, Lebanon.
   ``We Americans are an action-oriented people. It's so difficult
for us to sit back and just pray,'' he said.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, by Moslem extremists in Beirut
and has been held the longest of 12 foreign hostages.
   Residents of Batavia will gather this week to observe the
anniversary of Anderson's abduction.
   ``There isn't a person in town who doesn't know who Terry is and
who doesn't regret what's happened to him,'' said Steven Hawley, a
high school classmate of Anderson, a 1965 graduate of Batavia High
School.
   Batavia, a city of 17,000 located 35 miles east of Buffalo, has
shown its concern. To mark the third anniversary of Anderson's
capture, hundreds of residents donned yellow ribbons and marched in
a candlelight vigil. And people turned out by the thousands to sign
greeting cards that were sent to Beirut for his 41st birthday last
October.
   However, the events masked deep anxiety within the community over
what to do about the hostages.
   Many people support Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, who has
traveled throughout the world, urging national leaders to work for
her brother's release.
   However, her outspokenness, including complaints that American
officials have not done enough for the hostages, has put off some
members of the community.
   Batavia is a conservative town built around a Veterans
Administration hospital with a sign that reads ``The Price Of
Freedom Is Visible Here.''
   Some people even considered Mrs. Say unpatriotic for criticizing
the Reagan administration, said Hawley, a Republican legislator in
Genesee County.
   Even Mrs. Say's supporters, such as Ann Zickl, acknowledge that
her comments were difficult for some people to accept.
   ``She's a strong, strong woman and this is a traditional
community,'' Mrs. Zickl said.
   Some questioned whether negative attention generated by Mrs.
Say's comments served the captors' purposes.
   ``At some point, many people began to wonder whether the media
attention may have been responsible for prolonging things,'' said
Kathy Conley, another classmate of Anderson who had been active on
his behalf. ``And, I think I might agree that his captors certainly
know what an issue he has become.''
   Mrs. Say acknowledges that the situation became politicized, but
she insists she had no other option but to speak out.
   Former hostages have told Mrs. Say that Anderson's captors would
kill him if they thought Americans had forgotten him.
   ``My path is clear,'' she said. ``We've got to keep the pressure
on because that's what has kept Terry alive.''
   Mrs. Say spoke from her home in Cadiz, Ky., where she said she
and her husband, David, moved last year for privacy.
   She has returned to Batavia several times to meet with supporters
and for interviews with the local media, and was expected to return
Sunday for an ecumenical service at Notre Dame High School.
   Her supporters say attitudes are changing.
   ``You don't hear real criticism of her anymore,'' said Terry
Fritts, the host of a talk show on local radio station WBTA. ``I
think people understand better what she was trying to do now.''
   ``There is also a lot of sympathy for her and her family,'' Ms.
Fritts added.
   In addition to Anderson's captivity, the family has suffered the
death of his father and brother.
   Scheider said the ordeal has been a challenge for people to
separate political issues from humanitarian concerns.
   Hawley said that although people have disagreed with Mrs. Say,
there is no animosity toward her.
   ``I'm not sure I wouldn't do the same thing if it was my
brother,'' he said.

   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson said
Saturday he believes his telephone has been tapped, and he expressed
fears that phones of other senior officials also have been bugged.
   Speaking in a Swedish radio interview, Andersson answered with a
decisive ``yes'' when asked whether he thought he had been bugged.
He declined to identify suspects, saying he lacked evidence.
   ``I know I've been bugged ... It's very alarming,'' he said.
Efforts to track down the perpetrators have failed, he added.
   Parliament speaker Thage G. Peterson told the radio there is no
proof that phones in the Parliament building have been bugged.
   Other officials of the government Social Democrats have
complained of illegal eavesdropping. Swedish newspapers have
suggested alleged extensive wire tapping was part of an unofficial
investigation last year into the unsolved Feb. 28, 1986,
assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   Swedish law permits bugging with court approval.

   Rep. Richard Cheney's personal and campaign
finances indicate he approaches his nomination as defense secretary
with almost none of the baggage that helped sink the first man
President Bush picked for the job.
   Unlike John Tower, who was rejected by the Senate in part because
of his relationships with the defense industry, Cheney's financial
benefactors have been dentists, insurance companies, farm groups and
energy companies.
   And although the Wyoming Republican has been paid better than
most of his House colleagues for giving speeches, raising a total of
$81,350 in 1987, he gave $59,000 of that to charity, according to
his most recent financial disclosure forms.
   That was more than he had to give away to meet House limits, and
none of the money had come from the defense industry.
   Over the last five years, Cheney has raised more money through
speaking fees, $266,875, than even House Republican leader Robert
Michel, who got $250,888, according to a study by Common Cause. He
kept $107,937 of that _ an average of a little over $20,000 a year.
   Cheney's disclosure forms show that he is financially comfortable
but is not rich.
   In 1987 he earned between $226,333 and $290,833 and had assets
worth between $200,000 and $530,000. He had less than $50,000 in
debts.
   Cheney depended on special interests to pay for about a third of
his last re-election campaign, which cost some $292,000 _ a
relatively small amount for congressional races.
   While much of his campaign money came from energy, insurance and
farming interests, Cheney did raise more than $13,000 from defense
contractors. However, all but one of those defense interests gave
far less than the legal limit, according to records filed with the
Federal Election Commission.
   That one company, FMC Corp., gave Cheney the $5,000 legal limit
through its political action committee.
   Other defense contractors contributing to his 1988 campaign
included Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp., which each
donated $1,500, and TRW Inc. and United Technologies Corp., which
each contributed $1,000.

<HEAD>Nunn's Nonpartisan Image Damaged In Tower Fight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the aftermath of the Senate's rejection of
former Texas Sen. John Tower for secretary of defense, Republican
punsters grumbled that their nominee had been brought down by a
relatively new phenomenon _ ``Nunnpartisanship.''
   The play on words _ a part snide and part comical reference to
Sen. Sen Nunn _ underscored both the pivotal role the Georgia
Democrat played in the struggle over the Tower nomination and the
irony that Nunn's influence in a partisan battle stemmed largely
from his reputation as the Senate's bipartisan defense expert.
   Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said when
the Tower debate began that he expected ``some permanent bruises''
before it was all over.
   And for the first time in his 16-year Senate career, as the
debate raged throughout last week, unn heard Republican colleagues
hurl heated and repeated charges of partisanship in his direction.
   ``This goes into the memory banks,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole of Kansas said after singling out Nunn for special criticism
following Tower's defeat.
   But while the Tower fight may have tarnished Nunn's reputation
for nonpartisanship, political observers say his stature within the
national Democratic Party has been enhanced.
   ``With a number of moderate to moderate-liberal Democrats, this
will increase his influence,'' Kevin Phillips, a Republican
political analyst, said in an interview Friday.
   ``He has chits with them that he may actually be able to cash in
for what some people would think of as more responsible defense
policy,'' Phillips said. ``This gives him leverage to pull hitherto
non-defense Democrats into a more defense posture.''
   William Schneider, a political analyst with the American
Enterprise Institute, said Nunn's role in the Tower fight will move
him onto center stage in national Democratic Party politics.
   ``Within his party, he will probably have more clout because he
delivered,'' Schneider said. ``He delivered a real punch to the
president of the United States. ...
   ``He's enhanced his image of power, as a national Democratic
player and as someone who delivers,'' he said. ``On the other hand,
there is obviously a downside. He's sacrificed some of the
bipartisan appeal he had in the past.''
   Both before and during the Tower debate, Republicans accused Nunn
of using the battle to increase his control over U.S. defense policy
and to launch his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in
1992.
   Nunn repeatedly denied any such motivations, saying his actions
were being questioned simply because he had the evidence on his side
and was leading the fight against Tower.
   Schneider said he has seen nothing to suggest that Nunn was
motivated by a desire to dominate national defense policy or to
enhance his presidential prospects.
   ``But if he does want either one of those things, the Tower fight
has helped both of those ambitions,'' he said. ``He's more of a
player in national security policy and he's more of a figure in
Democratic Party politics, no question about it.''
   There's also little question that the controversy over the Tower
nomination has changed the way Nunn is viewed in the Senate. The
hard feelings generated by the fight, as Dole's comment suggests,
won't soon be forgotten.
   ``The difficulty for Nunn and the difficulty for everybody else
is going to be that it is a whole new ball game,'' Phillips said.
``It's not the old ball game that Sam Nunn had been playing in, that
he had scored very well in.
   ``This is a new national ball game and it's going to be a
different one and it's going to have its share of unpleasantness,''
said Phillips.

   The Southern California Rapid Transit District, hoping to
discourage seat-destroying vandals, plans this summer to begin
replacing soft, cushioned seats in more than 1,000 of its buses with
hard plastic ones.
   ``Unfortunately, there will be some reduction in comfort without
a padded cushion,'' said RTD Associate General Manager John
Richeson. ``However, we believe it is a reasonable trade to make. It
is a question of what is the best use of the public's transit
dollars.''
   Officials say it costs $400,000 a year to replace soft seats
ripped up by vandals.
   The RTD has set aside $3 million to install hard seats on 1,355
of the district's 2,150 buses.

<HEAD>Top Democrats Call for Setting Aside Rancor of Tower Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders of Congress endorsed
Saturday their party's search for a new agenda and signaled
President Bush that they are willing to set aside the bitterness of
the debate over John Tower.
   In a joint appearance at the annual meeting of the Democratic
Leadership Council, House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell made pointed references to the need
for a bipartisan foreign policy.
   For his part, Bush also appeared eager to put the Tower debate
behind him. Within 24 hours of the rejection of his first choice for
secretary of defense, the president selected Rep. Dick Cheney,
R-Wyo., for the post and Democrats greeted the choice warmly.
   ``Notwithstanding the Tower nomination debate, I believe our
first objective must still be to re-establish a bipartisan foreign
policy,'' Mitchell told the DLC.
   ``We shall seek avenues of agreement with this new president,''
said Wright. ``We'll support a bipartisan foreign policy and many of
Mr. Bush's domestic goals. But we'll not be subservient.''
   ``It is a Democratic tradition to take the risk of proposing new
ideas and defending them,'' said Mitchell. ``It is a Democratic
tradition to have an agenda.''
   Sen. Jim Sasser of Tennessee sounded a more partisan note when he
said, ``The fresh breeze that we heard in January has rapidly turned
into the doldrums of March.''
   He described the new Republican administration as ``a government
adrift'' and said, ``It appears there is a policy vacuum at least
for the time being.''
   While there was widespread agreement on the need for a bipartisan
foreign policy, the Democrats were engaged in a sometimes heated
debate on the direction the party should take on domestic issues.
   The DLC was formed four years ago by officeholders determined to
stem what they saw as the national party's leftward drift.
   Wright warned that the idea that Democrats must choose between
representing the poor and minorities on the one hand or middle class
whites on the other was ``quite possibly the most foolish suggestion
I have ever heard.''
   ``To make a choice between the interests of the median income
Americans and those of the less fortunate who want only to scale the
ladder to join the median income ranks would be an act of
self-defeating folly,'' said the House speaker.
   Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown told the DLC the party
must define what it stands for and that Democrats ``must not lose
our sense of direction or our sense of confidence.''
   Brown praised the DLC for developing a public service proposal
now endorsed, in part, by Bush.
   ``Republicans think community service is something you are
sentenced to after you are caught,'' quipped the chairman.
   As a former aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Jesse Jackson,
Brown won the chairmanship over the opposition of many DLC members.
   ``I know there are many in this room who were less than wildly
enthusiastic about the prospect of Ron Brown being chairman of the
Democratic National Committee,'' said Brown.
   But he said he was attending the DLC meeting to demonstrate ``how
committed I am to working with you.''
   ``It's very important that you are here and I appreciate the
spirit that you bring,'' Sen. Bob Graham of Florida told Brown after
his speech.
   Brown offered an optmistic view of where the party was heading in
the wake of its fifth loss in the last six presidential elections.
   ``For the first time in a long time we are thinking big,'' he
said. ``We are talking like a party that believes in sensible
government ...''
   ``If we carry forward this debate vigorously, we can be firm
about the future of our party and our country,'' he said.

   Space shuttle Discovery's cargo bay
holds a $100 million satellite whose deployment will complete an
orbiting communications network and enable NASA to shut six ground
stations at a savings of $3 million a month.
   The astronauts' release of the 2{-ton Tracking and Data Relay
Satellite into its own orbit 22,300 miles up is the main goal of the
28th space shuttle mission scheduled for liftoff here Monday morning.
   The first TDRS was launched from Challenger in 1983, and
Challenger was carrying a second one that was destroyed along with
the seven-person crew in the disaster of Jan. 28, 1986.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration considers the
TDRS system so vital to space communications that TDRS satellites
were assigned to two of the first three shuttle missions after the
Challenger explosion.
   On the first of those missions, Discovery's crew successfully
launched a TDRS last September. If the third satellite is
successfully launched Monday on the third post-Challenger flight,
the system will be complete, with the two newest satellites in use
and the oldest one serving as a spare.
   Liftoff is set for 8:07 a.m. Monday for a five-day mission, with
five astronauts on board. Discovery's countdown was put on hold for
seven hours Saturday morning because high winds on Friday had slowed
launch preparations, but NASA said the delay should not affect the
launch.
   Under the current system, 14 ground stations are stationed around
the globe, and the shuttle communicates with Earth by beaming
messages down to whatever station is closest, which then relays the
information to mission control. Because the stations are so widely
spaced, astronauts aboard the shuttle can't radio Earth at all for
85 percent of the time.
   With the TDRS system, the shuttle will be out of radio contact
with mission control just 15 percent of the time and it will be able
to transmit much more data. Instead of radioing down to a ground
station, the shuttle will send and receive its messages by
transmitting upward to the TDRS satellites, one high over the
Atlantic and the other high above the Pacific.
   Because the TDRS satellites are positioned much farther away from
Earth than the shuttle in orbit, they have the vantage points that
will allow the shuttle to maintain radio contact with a single
ground station on Earth almost all the time.
   The TDRS also will improve communications with other satellites,
including some military satellites.
   With its seven antennas, a TDRS satellite can transmit to the
ground station at White Sands, N.M., the equivalent of a 20-volume
encyclopedia in one second.
   Scheduled for closing are stations at Ascension Island in the
South Atlantic; Santiago, Chile; Guam; Kauai, Hawaii; Dakar,
Senegal; and Yarragadee, Australia. They employ a total of nearly
400 people, and most stations date back to Mercury, America's first
man-in-space program, in the early 1960s.
   Three of the stations, at Madrid, Spain; Canberra, Australia; and
Goldstone, Calif., will not be closed but will be used by a space
project managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
   The other five stations will provide tracking data as a shuttle
is launched or is landing. They are at Merritt Island and Ponce de
Leon in Florida; Bermuda; Wallops Island, Va.; and Dryden Flight
Research Facility, Calif.
   Charles Hunter, TDRS project manager for NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center in Maryland, said the closings will save NASA ``about
$3 million a month, once we get operational.''
   Astronauts Robert Springer and James Bagian are to release the
satellite from Discovery's cargo bay 6 hours 13 minutes after launch
at an altitude of 184 miles.
   An attached rocket stage is to ignite and boost the satellite to
a stationary orbit 22,300 miles up. A series of ground-controlled
maneuvers over several weeks will shift it to its permanent outpost
high above the Pacific near South America.
   TRW Space &amp; Technology Group builds the TDRS satellites for
CONTEL, which leases them to NASA.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's turn-about proposal
aimed at dampening Latin America's debt crisis is getting generally
good reviews, despite some reservations that it may not go far
enough to quell the region's explosive social unrest.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, spurred on in part by the
Venezuelan riots that claimed 300 lives two weeks ago, announced
Friday that the U.S. government was switching gears and looking
favorably for the first time on forgiving some of the Third World's
crushing $1.3 trillion debt.
   The new plan turns away from the Reagan administration's policy
of piling new debt on top of the old. It is directed primarily at
Latin America's most heavily obligated nations, such as Mexico,
Venezuela and Brazil, which have accumulated some $410 billion in
loans.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a key member of the House Banking
Committee and a specialist on international finance, lauded the
shift.
   ``It is clear that the administration has finally kicked the
habit. New money will no longer be used to bail out the bad,''
Schumer said after the Brady speech.
   But Schumer said, as did others, that Brady's proposal lacked
detail and did not define how extensive the debt relief might be. He
noted that the proposal calls for voluntary action on the part of
the lending banks.
   ``Two looming questions remain _ how much relief can actually be
provided on a voluntary basis and how carefully will that relief be
channeled to actually raise living standards in Third World
countries,'' the congressman said.
   In their attempts to meet the demands for economic reform from
their creditors, Latin American nations have cut wages and
government subsidies, resulting in sharply reduced living standards
amidst stalled economic growth.
   The result, a rising tide of political and economic instability
in those key Latin nations, has become the focus of increasing
concern to members of Congress and the administration, as well as
the international banks that have extended the billions in loans.
   In order to encourage the commercial banks to look more favorably
on debt forgiveness, the administration also called on the two major
international lending institutions _ the World Bank and its sister
organization the International Monetary Fund _ to provide guarantees
of interest and other assurances against debts that go bad.
   James D. Robinson, chairman of American Express Co. and the
author of his own debt relief plan which he put forward in 1988,
said after Brady's address:
   ``The good news is that the momentum is getting underway ... The
financing techniques are within reach. The question is whether the
political will is there.''
   He quipped that he was pleased that the concepts of debt relief
and debt forgiveness ``are no longer ... X-rated words.''
   Robinson cautioned that the administration must keep the momentum
moving and make the plan a top priority when the IMF and World Bank
meet in Washington at the end of the month. And it must be pursued
at the annual economic summit of the world's leading democracies in
Paris in July, he added.
   ``This is no longer a banking problem, it means jobs and
international security,'' Robinson warned.
   Such expressions of concern were echoed by Venezuela's President
Carlos Andres Perez, who termed the Brady proposals ``very timid,''
adding that ``they do not go far enough to satisfy the minimum
aspirations of Latin America.''
   But the Venezuelan leader also welcomed the proposals for opening
``a dialogue with the administration of President Bush.''
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari hailed the
proposal as ``a first and positive response to Mexico's position''
and he sent his Treasury Secretary, Pedro Aspe, to Washington for
talks with U.S. officails.
   Mexico, which is attempting to restructure payments on its $107
billion debt, is seen by several debt experts as the most promising
candidate for the new approach.
   Both Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., a member of the Senate Finance
Committee, and World Bank head Barber Conable, asked on Friday for
special consideration for Mexico because of its progress toward
economic reform.
   ``If investment is not made and jobs are not created in Mexico,
the United States could face a tidal wave of illegal immigration,''
Bradley warned.
   Bradley, in a commentary published in Friday editions of The New
York Times, noted that the rise of Mexico's leftist Cardenista Front
for National Reconstruction has exactly paralled the drop in living
standards.
   Unless Mexico is granted sufficient debt relief in a timely
fashion, Bradley asserted, America's southern neighbor ``will be
thrown into economic chaos or revert to self-destructive
nationalism.''

<HEAD>Horde Of Potential Heirs Appear To Claim Miser's Fortune</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News reports of a 77-year-old miser who
died with no known relatives and had $250,000 stashed in banks
across the country have drawn out a horde of would-be heirs.
   And now the lawyer in charge of the man's estate has got a judge
to agree to a search for even more money.
   At least 400 people claiming blood ties to Henry Drummond have
called the Ingham County Probate Court or Paul Rosenbaum, the
state-appointed lawyer handling Drummond's estate. An additional 150
have written.
   ``I have about 100 people asking for checks who say they are
second cousins twice-removed,'' Rosenbaum said. ``It's like `Send me
a check, we'll figure out how I'm related later.'''
   If no relatives are found, Drummond's estate will go to the state
of Michigan.
   Thanks to bank correspondence found in Drummond's $49-a-week room
at the YMCA in downtown Lansing, Rosenbaum has located accounts
holding more than $250,000 in nine banks from Denver to Boston.
   And during a hearing Thursday in Ingham County Probate Court,
Rosenbaum said Drummond's fortune could be even larger than first
thought, swelled by what he believes are extensive holdings in
stocks and bonds.
   In addition to the mail from banks in Drummond's room, the lawyer
said he found a key to a safe-deposit box, but it doesn't fit any
safe-deposit boxes in Lansing. Judge George Economy authorized
Rosenbaum to spend $5,000 to hire a private investigator to scour
the country for the box that matches the key.
   Drummond died Jan. 28, three weeks after he was found unconscious
in his $49-a-week room at the YMCA in downtown Lansing.
   He had come to town in 1985, and spent his days roaming the
streets.
   He wore an old fedora, an old coat and had unwashed, scraggly
hair and a beard. He apparently did not bathe often. Workers in the
Federal Building once chipped in and bought Drummond a suit and
other clothes. He never wore them.
   If anyone asked about his past or his family, he would become
evasive, said postal worker Francis Dodge.
   In Drummond's room, Rosenbaum found hundreds of pairs of used
shoe laces, three old suits, eight pairs of shoes and 50 pairs of
white socks. One drawer was full of clippings and pictures of
Princess Diana of Great Britain.
   Rosenbaum also found journals in Drummond's handwriting, from
which he has been able to put together a sketchy history.
   Drummond was born June 27, 1911, in Houston. His father was John
T. Drummond, a carpenter for the Southern Pacific Railroad. His
mother's maiden name was Westelle Rosalie Howard. He was an only
child.
   When Drummond was 4, his father left and later died in Denver.
His mother died in 1952 at the age of 80.
   Drummond graduated from high school in Pasadena, Calif., and
worked in a bank. He was drafted in 1942 and served four years in
the Army as a clerk-typist, before returning to the bank.
   Drummond wrote that he was fired from his bank job in 1959 by a
man who accused him of stealing adhesive tape and other supplies. He
then worked as a postal clerk in Pasadena until he retired in 1973.
   Then it was on to Denver, where he lived at a YMCA until 1981. He
spent the next four years roaming the East Coast, staying at YMCAs
and opening bank accounts.
   Drummond was earning some $20,000 a year in interest and his
government pension when he died.

   Actress Cybill Shepherd says she is
saddled in the tabloids with a reputation for being difficult
because she tends to her 16-month-old twins while on the set of the
TV series ``Moonlighting.''
   ``Mostly it's all garbage,'' Shepherd said in Sunday's editions
of The Tennessean newspaper. ``I know I'm a good mother. My kids are
near the `Moonlighting' set with me all the time. That's part of
what causes me to have a reputation for being `difficult.'
   ``I won't ignore them. I know they may be a nuisance in the eyes
of some people, but everybody at the studio who matters was told I
was going to do it. The twins don't nurse as much now, so they're
not quite so much trouble,'' she said.

   Rock star Jon Bon Jovi ended up in handcuffs
after he and some friends were caught trespassing on a closed
skating rink in Central Park.
   Bon Jovi, 27, of Rumson, N.J., his girlfriend and another couple
were arrested by a Parks Department patrol officer and taken to the
Central Park Precinct station house early Friday morning, police
said.
   They were given summonses for trespassing at Wollman Rink and
released within an hour, leaving plenty of time for Bon Jovi to
perform at a sold-out concert Friday night at the Nassau Coliseum.
   A spokesman for the group said Bon Jovi, who was booked under his
real name, John Bongiovi, and the rest of the band were off Thursday
night and Bon Jovi and his friends left their hotel room to take a
carriage ride in Central Park.
   When they couldn't find a hansom cab, they decided to go ice
skating in their shoes and sneakers.

   MELBOURNE, Australia _ Former Olympic and world ice-skating
champion Christopher Dean suffered back and neck injuries in a motor
racing crash Saturday at Calder Park near here.
   Dean, who has achieved worldwide fame with skating partner Jane
Torvill, was driving a Holden Commodore in a 10-lap challenge race
when he lost control of the vehicle.
   A witness said Dean's vehicle skidded into the outside wall of
the oval speedway suffering damage to the front and rear ends.
   Dean suffered a whiplash injury and aggravated an old back
complaint, according to a Calder Park spokesman.
   Although the injuries were not considered serious, doctors sent
Dean to Melbourne's Prince Henry's hospital for precautionary
X-rays. A hospital spokesman said Dean had not been treated and the
X-rays were not urgent.

officer stopped to help him with his broken-down van.
   Rush, 51, of Jackson, whose real name is Emmett Ellis Jr., has
denied any knowledge of the foot-long plastic pipe found under his
van before being arrested Thursday by police Capt. Robert Dowe.
   The pipe contained a substance believed to be cocaine, surrounded
by a spicy substance which can conceal drug odors from trained

   Madeline Kahn loves the role of Billie Dawn in
the Broadway revival of ``Born Yesterday,'' but she lives with being
compared to Judy Holiday, who created the role onstage in 1946 and
later won an Oscar for the film.
   ``I knew, accepting the challenge of the role, that I might
fail,'' she said in an interview in Saturday editions of the New
York Post.
   ``A lot of actresses who are known and who are risking a
reputation, rather than an unknown and risking nothing, would not do
this role, because they don't want to be unfavorably compared to
her. I decided to do it, but it was always a ghost in the back of my
mind.''
   She called the part in the Garson Kanin comedy ``a wonderful
classic role.''
   The revival closely follows the original, but Miss Kahn says she
once experimented with modernizing a line. It was effective, she
said, but changing it once was enough.
   ``To say to a man in 1946, `drop dead,' was beyond belief. Now,
the equivalent would be obscene. I know. I tried it once,'' she said.
   In the scene, she paused, turned to co-star Ed Asner, who plays
the part of the rude, crude and wealthy junk dealer Harry Brock, and
suggested that he kiss a certain part of her anatomy.
   ``The audience was shocked, and they laughed a lot,'' Miss Kahn
said, ``but I wouldn't do it a second time. It's funny, but it's not
what the playwright wrote, and it's not in the spirit of the
writing.''

   U.S. officials said Saturday following an
unprecedented inspection of Soviet mental hospitals that they could
not determine whether patients still are held because of their
political beliefs.
   A team of psychiatrists, lawyers and interpreters interviewed 27
patients and former mental patients in a review spurred by Western
charges of widespread psychiatric abuses.
   The Soviet Union withdrew from the World Psychiatry Association
in 1983 under pressure from the West. It has pledged to end abuses
and hopes to be readmitted this year to the association.
   At a news conference Saturday, the Americans refused to discuss
individual cases or their conclusions about the Soviet mental health
system.
   ``We will not deny that this has been a very sensitive and
difficult undertaking to carry out to our full satisfaction,'' said
delegation leader Robert W. Farrand of the State Department's Bureau
of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs.
   Asked if he could say if there were any political prisoners still
in Soviet mental hospitals, Farrand responded that ``no one can
prove the negative.''
   He said, however, that the human rights situation in the Soviet
Union had improved substantially. The number of people the U.S.
government lists as political prisoners is ``well down'' from 750
two years ago, Farrand said.
   ``We would not have agreed as a government to come to Moscow in
1991 for a human rights conference if we had not been convinced that
the question of political prisoners had, in the main, been
resolved,'' he said.
   The team's lead psychiatrist, Dr. Loren H. Roth of the University
of Pittsburgh's Law and Psychiatry Program, said Soviet officials
were late in providing some medical records and that some patients
had been discouraged from consenting to interviews.
   However, he said the group eventually was able to interview those
people.
   Delegation sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said they
had no indication of retribution against patients who gave
interviews.
   Yuri A. Reshetov, head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Office of
International Cooperation and Humanitarian Affairs, said there are
no political prisoners in mental hospitals.
   But he said some people named on Western human rights lists may
be ``undergoing treatment due to specific concrete actions against
the law.''
   Of the 27 people interviewed, 15 were in mental hospitals and 12
were former mental patients, Farrand said.
   All were being held for political reasons, according to reports
by Western human rights monitors. Patients were permitted to request
that Soviet doctors not be present during the interviews.
   The Americans visited seven mental hospitals, including
facilities in Kazan, Leningrad and Chernyakhovsk under the control
of the Interior Ministry, which is responsible for the Soviet
Union's uniformed police.
   Hospitals controlled by the ministry have been identified as
places where dangerous criminals and political prisoners have been
held.
   Under a government decree in January 1988, those hospitals are
being transferred to the jurisdiction of the Health Ministry, which
runs all other mental hospitals. The decree also made it a crime for
anyone to knowingly commit a sane person to a mental institution.
   U.S. officials said they still were reviewing medical records
provided by Soviet doctors and will complete a summary of their
report in four to six weeks. It then will be turned over to Soviet
officials to add their comments before it is published.

   The first time William Haast brought home
poisonous snakes, his horrified mother left home for three days. She
came back only because she realized her son's interest wasn't about
to slither away.
   At 78, Haast remains a self-described ``snake-aholic,'' who has
kept his energy and enthusiasm though he just weathered his 148th
snake bite. It is not surprising it was the viper, not Haast, who
passed on.
   Haast is founder and director of the Miami Serpentarium
Laboratories, which he started in Miami in 1946. He relocated the
lab to Salt Lake City five years ago to concentrate on venom
research and production.
   Haast claims to be the first to standardize snake venom and
produce it for research use. His clients include Wyeth Laboratories,
the only producer of antivenins in North America, and almost every
university in the country. He also has helped foster research into
the use of venom against such diseases as polio, multiple sclerosis
and AIDS.
   Haast was in his lab collecting venom from a Pakistani pit viper
Feb. 28 when the serpent bit his left thumb. Not overly concerned,
he waited to see if the weekly venom injections he has given himself
for 40 years would provide immunity to the poison.
   When the bite was still bleeding after 24 hours, he took himself
to the hospital and was diagnosed in critical condition, the venom
robbing his blood of the ability to clot. Doctors said he could have
bled to death from a bump or fall.
   ``I guess I excited every hematologist (blood doctor) in town,''
he said. ``They dug up all the information they had on snake bites.''
   Haast, who was released from the hospital Wednesday, praised the
extraordinary efforts in his behalf to obtain antivenins from
California, England, the Soviet Union and even from private sources
in Iran. A White House aide helped contact foreign sources and ease
passage of the medicines through Customs.
   ``Those people involved in getting the antivenins are the heroes
of the story,'' he said. ``All I am is the result of an accident.''
Haast's condition started improving after he received the serum from
California, and doctors in the end opted not to use the foreign
serums.
   The night before Haast was bitten, he and Nancy Harrell, who
helps direct the lab, went to a local steak house for what she
called ``anything goes day.''
   Sometimes at the end of the month Haast abandons a strict routine
that includes eating animal protein only on even-numbered days and
never touching refined sugar. This night, he consumed four chocolate
sundaes.
   ``When I let myself go, I really let go,'' he said.
   The next day, Harrell said, Haast was a little hastier than usual
in his work. ``He was really buzzing around the lab that day,'' she
said.
   He believes his strict regimen _ which also includes always
walking up the 11 flights to his condominium _ helped him overcome
the viper's venom and to cleanse his system. It wasn't until nine
days after the bite that he ate solid food. Meantime, the snake had
died of natural causes.
   Haast, first bitten in 1926, says his interest in snakes dates
back nearly 70 years to when he collected garter snakes out of
canals in Paterson, N.J.
   In Miami, Haast's serpentarium near the highway to the Florida
Keys was as much a tourist attraction as a laboratory. Visitors
could watch from a glass-enclosed amphitheater while Haast extracted
venom from hundreds of different species of snakes.
   He and Harrell moved the facility to Salt Lake City in 1984 to
focus more on research. He declines to say just how well the
business is faring except to say it's ``holding its own.''
   Haast collects venom from each snake about once a week, at the
same time they are fed a high-protein formula he mixes himself.
Harrell helps with the feedings; feeding and venom collection are
done at the same time to minimize trauma to the snakes.
   Nearly 50 years ago, Haast had a hunch that snake venom may be
valuable in treating polio and was proved right. Later, he had the
same feeling about multiple sclerosis and more recently has explored
the possibility of using venom in the fight against AIDS.
   Haast and Utah businessman Alan Glanville have organized AIDS
experimental treatment and research in Mexico. Both hesitate to
discuss the project, saying it is in its infancy and the hospitals
and researchers involved require anonymity.
   Even after his latest brush with death, Haast says there is
little chance he will retire. In fact, he plans to start giving
himself booster shots to create an immunity to the species of viper
that bit him.

   Soldiers and police took over two
jails and arrested the wardens and 40 guards to thwart a planned
breakout by 10 people held on drug trafficking charges, a police
chief said Saturday.
   A special force of 60 soldiers and police took part in the raids
late Friday at a prison and a nearby penal farm in the northern port
of La Ceiba, said Col. Rolando Valencia, a district Public Security
Administration chief.
   Valencia told The Associated Press the government took action
after authorities were tipped off that 10 Hondurans arrested on drug
trafficking charges were planning ``a massive jailbreak.''
   He refused to elaborate on the police tip, but he said the 10
also received special treatment from the wardens and guards.
   The prisoners were picked up last week, and authorities said they
were trying to smuggle 26 pounds of cocaine into the United States.
   Valencia said there was no violence in the operation at La Ceiba,
a Caribbean port 260 miles north of Tegucigalpa. He said the force
arrested the 40 prison guards and the two wardens, Edgardo Cabrera
and Adolfo Velasquez.
   ``The action was justified in view of the magnitude of the
problem it would have caused,'' Valencia said. ``The operation was
also carried out to do away with the corruption that was prevalent
in these jails, in which the wardens apparently were accomplices.''
   Justice Minister Enrique Ortiz Colindres ordered the wardens
fired, Valencia said.
   A special force raided the Central Penitentiary in Tegucigalpa on
Feb. 20 after rumors circulated that some of the 1,500 inmates,
including a number of suspected drug traffickers, planned an escape.
   Its warden and deputy warden were fired, and more than 150 guards
were arrested.
   The remote, sparsely populated north coast of Honduras has become
a favorite stop for smuggling South American cocaine into the United
States.
   During the past six years, the army located and destroyed more
than 50 clandestine airstrips, which smugglers' airplanes used as
refueling stops.
   Juan Ramon Matta, a reputed cocaine smuggler, escaped from a
Colombian jail in 1986 and established a center of operations in
Honduras until April 1988, when Honduran authorities arrested him
under U.S. pressure.
   The deportation of Matta to stand trial in the United States set
off violent demonstrations during which the U.S. Consulate in
Tegucigalpa was set afire.
   The U.S. District Court in Pensacola, Fla. last year convicted
and sentenced Matta to three years in prison for a 1971 escape from
a Florida prison. He is under indictment in three drug trafficking
cases in California and one in Arizona.

<HEAD>Red Noses Raise Millions For Charity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Britain's love affair with plastic red noses raised
millions of dollars for charity for the second straight year,
organizers said Saturday.
   Millions of Britons donned the clown-like protuberances Friday
and put them on cars, planes, mountaintops, statues and pigtails in
50,000 fund-raising events capped by a seven-hour Red Nose Day
television spectacular.
   One jogger, Sam Freemantle, streaked two miles through a Bristol
shopping center wearing only a red nose.
   Comic Relief, the coalition of comedians and aid groups that
organized the event, said Saturday it expected to raise far more
than the $27 million collected from the first Red Nose Day last year.
   Television viewers had pledged $17.9 million by Saturday morning,
far above the $4.3 million pledged at the same time last year.
   In addition, 6 million shiny red noses were sold at pubs, stores
and charity shops for 86 cents each. Another 2 million larger models
for trucks, taxis and cars went for a $1.72 apiece.
   ``It is unbelievable,'' said a Comic Relief spokesman, commenting
on condition of anonymity. ``People have been offering us cars and
percentages from the sale of their houses.''
   Two-thirds of the money raised will go to Third World projects
and the Save the Children Fund, and the rest to programs in Britain
to help young people and the elderly.
   Benny Watts, 20, from Taunton in Somerset, will remember his
contribution forever: he raised $515 by having two red noses
tattooed on his buttocks, and he dropped his trousers in his local
pub to prove it.
   In Bournemouth, an armed gang wearing red noses burst into a Post
Office and pistol-whipped the postmaster but fled empty-handed.

   Carroll O'Connor, who played the irascible Archie
Bunker on television's ``All in the Family,'' had coronary bypass
surgery Saturday at Atlanta's Emory University Hostipal.
   O'Connor, 64, was doing fine after five hours of cardiac bypass
surgery, in which doctors performed six grafts to repair damage
around his heart, said hospital spokeswoman Judy Smith.
   He was scheduled to remain in Emory's cardiovascular intensive
care unit for two or three days, then move to a standard hospital
room for another week or so of recovery, Ms. Smith said.
   ``The doctors say his cardiac function is good. He's doing
well,'' she said.
   O'Connor's surgery was ordered Friday after a physical
examination at Emory indicated the need for coronary artery bypass,
according to his publicist, Maggie Begley.
   An angiogram test was performed because of a ``positive stress
test'' on O'Connor during a routine physical examination by his
physician in nearby Covington, where the actor was filming, Ms.
Smith said.
   O'Connor, who now stars as Police Chief Bill Gillespie on NBC's
``In the Heat of the Night,'' was accompanied to the hospital by his
wife, Nancy.
   David Gerber, chairman of MGM-UA Television, the show's
producers, said studio officials would meet this weekend to
determine what effect the star's hospitalization might have on the
show's schedule.
   Gerber said, however, that production of the show was proceeding
as usual. He said 18 of the planned 22 episodes already had been
completed.
   O'Connor is best known for his portrayal of Archie Bunker, an
outspoken, bigoted Queens, N.Y., family man, on the trailblazing
comedy ``All in the Family.'' The show began on CBS in January 1971.

<TEXT>
   After two successful space shuttle
launches, intensive tests and examinations of Morton Thiokol's
redesigned booster rockets have revealed only one minor mystery, a
company spokesman says.
   For some reason, the metal ``capture features'' added to the
booster's field joints in the wake of the 1986 Challenger disaster
have exhibited small scratches, said Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky
Raab.
   However, Raab said in an interview from Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
that the scratches, also called ``fretting,'' pose no threat to
flight safety and the aerospace manufacturer is convinced its
booster ``really is the best rocket motor ever made.''
   As in the past two flights, the twin solid-fuel boosters that are
scheduled to hurtle Discovery skyward on Monday carry special
instruments to track every nuance of their two-minute performance.
   The instruments, modified versions of the kind used on six
full-scale booster test-firings at Morton Thiokol's Wasatch
Operations in northern Utah, are intended to ``record the actual
flight environment to compare with the test environment,'' Raab said.
   ``That's to ensure that the tests are accurate for predicting
flights, and that no unexpected phenomena occur,'' he said.
   Raab said that except for the scratches, which did not occur
during the test-firings, and the harmless loss of small pieces of
cork insulation on the earlier flights, ``there appear to be none.''
   The capture feature consists of a metal-to-metal lip that helps
hold the joint together under the intense stress of firing.
   Raab said engineers have speculated the scratches may have been
caused by wave action in the ocean, where the boosters fall after
spending their propellant and are towed to land by ships.
   He said that while safety isn't an issue if the scratches
occurred at that point, the reusability of the rocket casings may
be. The cases are designed to be used repeatedly.
   ``It's not clear yet,'' Raab said. ``The bad news is that because
we don't understand it, we've proposed to NASA that we put
instruments on the towback to record what happens, but they haven't
funded that yet.''
   The capture feature, the only metal-to-metal part of the
redesigned field joint, was one of scores of changes to the
booster's three field joints to ensure that no superheated gas
escapes, as it did in the Challenger explosion.
   A presidential commission found that a faulty joint allowed a
plume of gas to escape, triggering the blast that destroyed
Challenger, killed its seven astronauts and grounded the nation's
manned space flight program for more than 2{ years.
   Investigators determined that subfreezing temperatures before the
doomed launch stiffened an O-ring seal, causing it to lose
pliability and contributing to the failure.
   The redesign project was estimated to have cost well over $500
million, and equipping the first three flight rockets with
instruments to measure temperatures, pressures, stresses, motion and
vibration has cost at least $3 million, Raab said.
   He said that over the next several months, Morton Thiokol
analysts will compile the information gathered on the boosters, then
turn it over to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   NASA, in turn, will ``make the decisions on what, if any, changes
should be made,'' Raab said.
   Morton Thiokol is betting that the redesigned motor will retain
NASA's favor, despite the agency's call for industry proposals for a
new generation of advanced shuttle rocket motors.
   Several aerospace companies, including Utah's Hercules Aerospace,
have submitted proposals and NASA is to announce its decision later
this month.

   Lord Crook, a former British delegate to the United
Nations and vice president of the U.N. Administrative Tribunal for
nearly 20 years, has died, his attorney said Saturday. He was 88.
   Crook, of Carshalton, who received his title in 1947, had been
ill for 3{ years and died Friday at a nursing home in Purley south
of London, said attorney Martin Smith.
   Born Reginald Douglas Crook on March 2, 1901, he joined the Labor
Party and became a senior civil servant, serving as chairman of the
National Dock Labor Board from 1951 to 1965 and general secretary of
the Ministry of Labor Staff Association for 20 years.
   In 1950, he was a member of the British delegation to the U.N.
General Assembly. The following year he became a member of the U.N.
Administrative Tribunal, which resolves work and wage disputes among
employees in the world body. He served as the tribunal's vice
president from 1952-71.
   He is survived by his son, Douglas, who inherits his title.
   There was no word on services or funeral arrangements.

<TEXT>
   The Eastern Airlines saga, a 60-year story of a
carrier that World War I flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker helped make
soar but Apollo 8 astronaut Frank Borman couldn't keep out of a
tailspin, is in Chapter 11.
   An unhappy ending is likely, with management blaming ``suicidal''
unions, who say corporate head Frank Lorenzo wants to kill organized
labor.
   Most clues to the case of who's killing Eastern Airlines point to
murder-suicide.
   At Eastern's headquarters, a towering fountain in tribute to
Rickenbacker today is guarded by double-stacked, razor-sharp
concertina wire while strikers on the other side of a fence topped
with more barbed wire chant: ``Hey, hey; ho, ho, Lorenzo's got to
go!''
   Inside, handfuls of management employees rush through quiet halls
past darkened offices as they struggle to maintain a skeleton
schedule during a crippling strike.
   This is the airline that once boasted of flying more passengers
than any carrier other than the Soviets' Aeroflot, and was the
nation's seventh-largest until nearly all union employees walked out
March 4, leading to Thursday's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Although Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo and Eastern
President Phil Bakes say Eastern will be rebuilt, unions will fight
them with their own reorganization plan and continue seeking a
buyout.
   The unions say Eastern is under deadly assault by Lorenzo, who
brought a union-busting reputation to the company three years ago
and a ``take-it-or-lose-your-job'' management style to a company
with some of the industry's strongest-willed unions.
   Massive concessions were demanded; firings, suspensions and
grievances skyrocketed; assets were spun off or sold, mostly to the
benefit of Lorenzo's parent Texas Air; and complex loans and
long-term notes from Eastern made it appear the carrier was helping
subsidize Lorenzo's non-union Continental Airlines.
   Charged with what management calls ``economic suicide'' are the
unions, particularly the pilots. Few were surprised that the
Machinists union's 17-month contract dispute and refusal to make
more concessions ended in strike, but management was stunned when
nearly all 3,600 pilots refused to cross picket lines.
   The pilots union remembered that Lorenzo used pilots to keep
Continental flying during a Machinists strike in 1983, but that the
pilots, too, lost their contracts in bankruptcy reorganization.
   Leading the Machinists is fiery District 100 President Charles E.
Bryan, with a stubborness born of studies of Zen, yoga, Gandhi and
Martin Luther King Jr., and a view of the conflict as that between
good and evil.
   ``Charlie is like one of those birthday candles that you blow out
and it comes back on,'' former company negotiator Jack Johnson once
said.
   Borman recently compared Bryan to cult leader Jim Jones, who led
the 1978 mass suicide in Guyana, and says he has ``a certifiably
insane dream of running the airline himself.''
   Eastern's history has been a long roller-coaster.
   It was born May 1, 1928, as Pitcairn Aviation, a mail carrier
that made its first Miami landing Dec. 1. It began passenger service
in 1930 and was renamed Eastern in 1938.
   The carrier was losing money in 1935 when Rickenbacker climbed
aboard, using his war-hero status and forceful personality to build
Eastern into a giant force in the industry.
   Eastern became the dominant north-south carrier east of the
Mississippi and boomed when post-World War II prosperity brought
leisure time to most Americans.
   National Airlines introduced jets to commercial aviation in 1958,
but Rickenbacker didn't believe they would work for carrying
passengers.
   By the time he left Eastern in 1963, the company was losing money
and had become known for benign neglect of passengers, some of whom
formed the ``We Hate Eastern Airlines'' club.
   Borman became president and chief executive in 1975, after the
company lost a then-staggering $53 million in 1973.
   As with Rickenbacker, Borman capitalized on his hero status and
brought a new style of pride and dedication. In 1976, he persuaded
his unions to accept a wage freeze.
   A 1976 profit led to a five-year Variable Earnings Program _ the
company held 3.5 percent of the workers' earnings, but if profits
were made the workers would get that 3.5 percent back plus an
additional 3.5 percent.
   The first two years brought employees nice Christmas checks, but
then came airline deregulation and stronger competition. Borman
countered by buying more planes, expanding service, going deeper in
debt.
   Bryan became the Machinists leader in 1980 after attacking the
VEP. The company unilaterally extended the program by a year,
leading to a 1983 showdown in which Borman, on the day of a strike
deadline, gave the Machinists 32 percent raises he said Eastern
couldn't afford.
   Borman gave the unions seats on the board of directors and
replaced the VEP with a stock-for-pay program that allowed employees
to acquire 25 percent of Eastern stock.
   By early 1986, Bryan was urging a full employee takeover.
Management fought back by demanding concessions. The pilots and
flight attendants agreed to 20 percent cuts.
   Bryan refused to make concessions unless Borman left. The board
refused to allow Bryan to dictate to it and sold out to Lorenzo on
Feb. 23, 1986.
   The next day, Lorenzo said: ``There ain't no Santa Claus.''
   Employees lost voting shares in the transaction and their seats
on the board.
   Lorenzo's management called for nearly 30 percent in cuts from
unions that had been giving back wages for much of the past 10
years. It made no bones about its plans _ if Eastern couldn't be
fixed the way management wanted, it would be tanked.
   The unions decided to take their chances.
   ``So here we are,'' reflected James Ashlock, an Eastern spokesman
or lobbyist for 22 years. ``At least now maybe we have a chance to
rebuild it right.''

<TEXT>
   VATICAN CITY _ U.S. Roman Catholic leaders ended a special
meeting with the pope Saturday acknowledging differences with the
Vatican but predicting the session won't ``change the shape of the
American Catholic Church.''
   ``This was not the bad schoolboys being called home to be
disciplined by their father,'' Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of
Cincinnati declared.
   Pope John Paul II called the extraordinary meeting to discuss how
bishops can spread Catholic teaching in an American society strongly
influenced by such secular trends as divorce, sexual promiscuity and
materialism.
   Because of the United States' worldwide influence, the Vatican
sees it as a battleground on which the church can win or lose its
fight against these trends.
   During four days of meetings, Vatican cardinals urged the 35
bishops to assert church teachings more vigorously and bring their
often independent-minded flock into line.
   Echoing those conclusions, the pope told the bishops gathered
Saturday in an underground stone hall:
   ``We are guardians of something given, and given to the Church
universal; something which is not the result of reflection, however
competent, on cultural and social questions of the day, and is not
merely the best path among many, but the one and only path to
salvation.''
   Some U.S. bishops responded that Catholic teachings only can
flourish when they take into account a society shaped by democracy
and give-and-take.
   ``Surely there are differences,'' Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of
Chicago said in a report summing up the talks. ``But these
differences stem from a single, burning desire: to teach and
evangelize in the most effective way possible, given the cultural
and societal realities of our time.''
   Speaking for the bishops, he called for clarification on how much
dissent can be allowed and said compromise sometimes is needed ``to
remain in the public debate and influence public morality.''
   Bernardin also suggested establishing a commission to increase
Catholic influence over segments of American culture, including the
media, art, entertainment and economics.
   He said the bishops additionally feel an ``urgent need'' for a
theological critique of radical feminism. Elaborating, Cardinal
Bernard Law of Boston inal Antonio Innocenti, the prefect of the Vatican's
Congregation for the Clergy, criticized some women for asking to be
priests, which the church considers a role only for men.
   ``There can be suspicions that this desire is fed more by the
search for power than the idea of service,'' he told reporters.
   Despite the Americans' recommendations and strong words from the
Vatican, the bishops indicated they expect little concrete change
soon because of the meeting.
   ``I don't think it will change the shape of the American Catholic
Church,'' said Pilarczyk.
   For the Vatican, Innocenti said he thought the meeting was a
``great step foward'' in unifying the church.
   Vatican and U.S. church leaders appear to remain apart on several
issues.
   For example, Vatican officials placed heavy emphasis on
artificial birth control, while Bernardin and other U.S. bishops
barely touched the subject. Large numbers of American Catholics
ignore the church's ban on artificial contraception.
   ``I would say that the issue has been dealt with implicitly ...
in the many times we looked at cultural factors which inhibit
acceptance of and living out of faith,'' Law said.
   While the Vatican questioned the U.S. annulment process and said
it seemed too many marriages are being annulled, the American
bishops defended their tribunals. Law said he foresaw no changes in
the process.
   However, there also was debate among the American prelates,
reflecting divisions within the U.S. church. American bishops
differed among themselves on such issues as the value of general
confession of sins, and the degree to which compromise is
permissible to adapt church teachings to U.S. society.

   A small plane carrying American tourists back
from a sightseeing trip crashed into a construction site on a
college campus, narrowly missing crowded classrooms but killing all
10 people aboard, officials said Saturday.
   Officials at Lima's airport said the pilot of the plane radioed
the control tower that he was having problems shortly before
Friday's crash in the capital's San Miguel neighborhood.
   ``It was flying as if it were a truck without brakes. It sounded
as if the motors were turned off,'' said Jesus Tarazona. Tarazona
was on the roof of his two-story home when the plane slashed through
thick fog shortly before nightfall and smashed into a two-story
building under construction at the University of San Martin de
Porras.
   A building next to the construction site was filled with about
150 students attending classes.
   The U.S. Embassy identified the American victims as John Howe,
81, and his wife Barbara, 72, of Hagerstown, Md.; Robert Fisher, 66,
and his wife Ruth, 62, of Moorestown, N.J.; Dorothy Menzies, 77, and
her daughter, Virginia Fennel, 48, of Hickory, N.C.; and Virginia
Hall, 78, and her granddaughter, Mary Shuford, 28, also of Hickory,
N.C.
   The Aerocondor flight's pilot and copilot, both Peruvians, also
were killed.
   Johan Leuridan, a university dean who was visiting the work site,
was hit by falling bricks and hospitalized with a back injury.
Police said all the workers at the site had left 15 minutes before
the crash.
   Hugo Monzon, general manager of Aerocondor, a small airline that
provides air taxi service to small towns in Peru, said the plane was
a British-made Norman Islander purchased six years ago.
   He said the cause of the accident had not been determined.
   The plane crashed nearly four miles from the Lima airport.
   Some students in the classroom building near the crash site told
reporters the sound from the crash was so loud they thought a
terrorist bomb had gone off or their building was collapsing.
   The plane smashed into a wall on the second floor of the
partially constructed building. A wing landed on the floor, and part
of the fuselage tumbled into a garden below.
   Several residents of the San Miguel district said they heard the
plane's engines sputtering seconds before the crash. But they said
they were unable to see the aircraft because of heavy fog.
   An Aerocondor official said the plane was returning to Lima after
having flown over the famous Nazca lines 250 miles southeast of the
capital.
   The Nazca lines are giant pre-Columbian drawings on the desert
believed to represent a primitive calendar used for calculating
planting and harvesting seasons.

   Sikh militants in the northwestern state
of Punjab killed at least 12 people, including a politician who had
survived two earlier assassination attempts, news reports said
Saturday.
   Suraj Prakash Malhotra, a local leader of Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's Congress Party, and Gajjan Singh, a state leader of the
Communist Party of India, were among the victims in a series of
attacks, Press Trust of India said.
   Militants have waged a bloody insurgency for an independent Sikh
nation since 1982, claiming they are discriminated against by the
country's Hindu majority.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's population but are a majority
in Punjab state.
   Malhotra, a former town president, was slain by militants Friday
night in his house in Ropar, the United News of India said. Malhotra
had survived two earlier attempts on his life, UNI said.
   Ropar is 155 miles north of New Delhi.
   Singh was gunned down by Sikh militants Saturday in the village
of Kalake near Amritsar, PTI said. Amritsar is about 280 miles
northwest of New Delhi.
   UNI said militants also shot to death a man outside the Golden
Temple in Amritsar. Another victim was dragged from his house in
Chak Sikander village and killed, and two neighbors were slain when
they tried to help him, the news agency said.
   Police said at least six others had been killed in separate
incidents across the state in the past 24 hours, PTI said.
   At least 2,400 people were killed by Sikh militants last year,
more than double the number killed in 1987.
   More than 380 people have been killed so far this year.

   Longtime companions Ryan O'Neal and Farrah
Fawcett tried tying the knot once _ but they ran out of gas.
   They say a second attempt is forthcoming, but the actors aren't
sure when.
   ``We were headed for the church but ran out of gas,'' Miss
Fawcett says of an attempt to wed during a vacation three years ago.
``It was a blizzard and no one would stop for us. It took hours to
get back to a warm place and, by that time, we were no longer in the
wedding mood.''
   The couple met 10 years ago while Miss Fawcett was wife of the
``Six Million Dollar Man,'' actor Lee Majors.
   ``Lee asked if I played racquetball, which I never did. I
reluctantly agreed to come over to the house and Farrah cooked
dinner. She had trouble getting rid of me from then on,'' O'Neal
says in an interview published in the current issue of USA Weekend.
   O'Neal, 47, and Miss Fawcett, 42, have a 4-year-old son, Redmond.
   ``We will definitely get married. We just haven't found the right
time. I feel married now,'' Miss Fawcett said.
   O'Neal's latest film, ``Chances Are,'' which he calls ``a kind,
decent picture,'' is now opening around the country. But, he says,
he doesn't work much anymore.
   ``Mostly I'm offered Rambo ripoffs. I'm pretty much semi-retired.
I don't want to be in any more bad pictures, so I'm not in a hurry
anymore,'' he says.

   A fire swept through a hillside
slum area in northern Rio de Janeiro on Saturday and left 500 people
homeless, but no one was injured, officials said.
   The fire started at around 5:00 a.m. in a home in the Parque
Alegria hillside community, fire chief Lt. Silvio Souza said.
   Souza said the flames raced through more than 150 fragile wood
and brick huts that sit atop the hills overlooking Rio's north zone.
   Firefighters, struggling to get trucks and water hoses up the
rugged hill, battled the fire for three hours in a confused scene of
smoke, screams and fire engine and ambulance sirens.
   Residents threw buckets of water on the flames and rushed madly
about with refrigerators, stoves, and cabinets on their shoulders
and backs to save them from the flames, the fire chief said.
   Miraculously, Souza said, no one was hurt.
   ``The whole area was completely destroyed,'' the fire chief said.
``Only some hollow huts made of brick were left standing.'' He said
the cause of the fire was not known.

   An Iranian envoy has been dispatched to
encourage other Moslem nations to support Iran's position on the
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' at a conference this week, according to
news reports Saturday.
   In England, home of the novel's author, Salman Rushdie, Moslems
staged demonstrations in two cities.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that
Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said during an audience with
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini the controversy over the book was
helping export the Islamic revolution.
   Khomeini did not speak during the meeting at a mosque in a Tehran
suburb, said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   IRNA said Ayatollah Ahmed Jannati, a special envoy, was touring
Moslem states in the region to try to forge a united front on the
issue at the Organization of Islamic Conference meeting scheduled to
begin Monday in Saudi Arabia.
   Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan said in a meeting
with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, that he hoped the
OIC ``will take a decisive stand to condemn the book,'' IRNA
reported.
   Observers expect a showdown between the majority Sunni and the
minority Shiite Moslems over the issue.
   There are 100 million Shiites among the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems. More than half the Shiites live in Iran, which has
called on Moslems to kill Rushdie.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggesting Mohammed wrote the Koran rather than receiving it from
God.
   Most nations in the Middle East have banned the book, as have
Asian countries with large Moslem populations.
   At least 19 people have been killed in India and Pakistan in
riots over the novel.
   Rushdie, a naturalized British citizen born to a Moslem family in
India, went into hiding after Khomeini issued his death threat last
month and Iranian religious leaders put a $5.2 million bounty on his
head.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain on March 7 over its
refusal to suppress the novel.
   On Saturday, 2,000 Moslems marched five miles through the town of
Slough west of London and burned an effigy of Rushdie.
   Dozens of police officers escorted the marchers and lines of
officers stood guard outside bookshops. Police said the march was
peaceful and there were no arrests.
   Busloads of protesters from around the English Midlands converged
on the central England town of Leicester, and about 5,000 marched
three miles through the city center.
   Police stopped the protesters from burning an effigy of Rushdie.
No one was arrested.

<TEXT>
   In a major report certain to
stir controversy, a government-appointed commission called Saturday
for an end to all apartheid laws and the creation of voting rights
for the black majority.
   The South African Law Commission said all attempts at race reform
were unlikely to succeed unless the government allows the country's
28 million blacks to participate fully in national elections.
   The commission's report was released one day after the main
Afrikaner church declared for the first time that apartheid is a
sin. The Dutch Reformed Church, which includes President P.W. Botha
and virtually his entire Cabinet as congregants, also expressed
guilt for its role in supporting apartheid.
   The commission report was the first time a government body called
for black voting rights, although individuals in government have
made similar statements on occasion.
   The commission was appointed by Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee in
1986 and includes officials in the Justice Department as well as
some of the country's senior judges and legal scholars.
   The government had no immediate comment on the report.
   South Africa should draw up a new constitution that guarantees
individual rights but expressly prohibits race-based ``group
rights,'' the report said.
   A bill of rights should ban all forms of discrimination, include
the right to appear in court after being arrested, and guarantee the
rights to peaceful protest and participation in political
organizations, the commission said.
   Under South Africa's apartheid policies of racial segregation,
the country's 5 million whites maintain economic and political
control over the 28 million blacks.
   Also, the government's 33-month-old state of emergency allows
authorities to detain people indefinitely without charge. Most forms
of peaceful protest are banned or restricted under the emergency
regulations.
   Botha has said repeatedly he will not even discuss the
possibility of a black majority government. He also has said he is
committed to segregated schools and neighborhoods.
   Botha is recovering from a stroke suffered Jan. 18. His heir
apparent, Education Minister F.W. de Klerk, has been depicted as
more flexible, but he appears to agree with Botha on most major
policy issues and his given no indication he would introduce radical
change.
   However, the law commission report repeatedly stressed the
importance of universal franchise to break the political deadlock.
   ``A bill of rights will not be accepted as legitimate if the
black people in South Africa are not given the vote,'' the
commission said. ``The right to vote is one of the fundamental human
rights that must be enshrined in any constitution.''
   The commission said before a new constitution is drawn up the
present statute book should be purged of discriminatory legislation.
   The report cited several legal obstacles to reform:
   _The country's 1983 constitution, which includes separate houses
of Parliament for whites, people of mixed race and people of Asian
descent but not for blacks.
   _The Population Registration Act, which requires all people to be
classified by race.
   _The Group Areas Act, which segregates neighborhoods by race.
   _Security legislation that allows for detention without trial.

<HEAD>Christian Government Orders Beirut Airport Closed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Christian Cabinet ordered Beirut's
airport closed Saturday after Druse militiamen shelled the city's
port and the Defense Ministry compound. Police said at least six
people died in the latest violence.
   As thunderous explosions echoed around the city, the Cabinet
headed by army commander Gen. Michel Aoun ordered the closure
because of ``threats to civil aviation safety.''
   But Moslem officials running the airport on Beirut's southern
edge said they would not comply.
   One official, Rida Fawli, said the airport _ Lebanon's only civil
aviation facility _ ``will remain open and functioning.''
   The fighting underscored heightening tensions over an air-and-sea
blockade enforced by Aoun since Monday. The blockade is aimed at
illegal ports operated by the country's warring militias.
   Police said at least six people were killed and 32 wounded in
four days of fighting, the worst across Beirut's dividing Green Line
and hills overlooking the capital in the past two years.
   Clashes erupted Wednesday around the mountaintop town of Souk
El-Gharb, where Aoun's predominantly Christian units have fought
with artillery and tank cannon almost daily against militiamen of
Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party.
   According to police count, four civilians have been killed and 15
others wounded in the fighting around Souk El-Gharb, 15 miles
southeast of Beirut.
   The deserted summer resort town, whose population of 15,000 fled
early on in the 14-year-old civil war, is in a strategic network of
mountain roads leading to the Christian heartland northeast of
Beirut.
   On Friday evening, Aoun's forces battled Syrian-backed Moslem
militiamen in the abandoned commercial district straddling Beirut's
shell-ravaged official harbor.
   On Saturday night, Druse gunners perched on Lebanon's central
mountain range around Souk El-Gharb shelled the port, the Defense
Ministry housing Aoun's command in suburban Yarze and the nearby
officers' residence complex in Jamhour, police said.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said at least two people were killed and 17 wounded in
the shelling in Jamhour.
   The spokesman said there were no casualties or damage reported at
the Defense Ministry, about five miles northeast of Beirut.
   The artillery duels later spread to 21 Moslem and Christian
residential districts around Beirut, and thousands of residents
sought refuge in basements and bomb shelters, police said.
   ``In view of worsening security conditions that pose a threat to
the safety of civil aviation and passengers at Beirut international
airport ... the government orders the airport closed until further
notice,'' Aoun's public works minister, Maj. Gen. Edgar Malouf, said
in a statement.
   But a statement issued by Jumblatt's office at the airport said:
``Nothing could happen as long as the Syrian army controls and
protects the airport. It shall continue functioning without
interruption.''
   Jumblatt serves as public works and tourism minister in the
Moslem cabinet of acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   Hoss' cabinet and Aoun's Christian administration have been
embroiled in a power struggle since Sept. 22.
   Jumblatt is allied with Syria, which maintains 40,000 troops in
northern and eastern Lebanon and in western and southern Beirut
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   The two Cabinets emerged when President Amin Gemayel's six-year
term in office expired and Parliament was unable to elect a
successor.
   Minutes before he stepped down, Gemayel named Aoun prime minister
of an interim military Cabinet.
   Moslems and leftists rejected his appointment and pledged
allegiance to Hoss.

<DATELINE>TICKFAW, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people were expected to gather
in the tiny southeast Louisiana town of Tickfaw on Sunday in hopes
of seeing an apparition of the Virgin Mary.
   ``We have calls coming in from all over. I understand there will
be charter buses from all over the United States,'' police Capt. Ted
Panning said Saturday.
   He said between 5,000 and 60,000 people were expected to converge
on Tickfaw, a town of 500 about 45 miles north of New Orleans.
   Their destination was a field where a wooden cross has been
erected beside a mobile home belonging to Alfredo Raimondo. Raimondo
says the Virgin Mary appeared to him in Chalmette, a New Orleans
suburb, and told him to go to Tickfaw to honor St. Joseph.
   The site is located between the Antioch Baptist Church and the
Sisters of St. Benedict Monastery. The pilgrims planned to celebrate
Mass outdoors, have a candlelight procession and pray the rosary,
said Robbi Mayfield, a pilgrimage organizer.
   Panning said as many as 50 law enforcement officers would be on
hand to help guide traffic and keep cars moving.
   ``We're going to try to be as understanding as possible,''
Panning said.
   Mayfield, who owns a shop that sells religious items in
Chalmette, said everyone wanted to know when the Virgin Mary would
appear.
   ``I don't know what's going to happen at Tickfaw. I don't know if
she intends to appear. I just know that she wants us to be there,''
Mayfield said.
   Raimondo and his wife are natives of Italy but have lived in
Chalmette for years, using the trailer in Tickfaw as a weekend camp,
acquaintances said.
   Mayfield describes Raimondo as deeply religious and said he has
reported witnessing apparitions in Medjugorje, Yugoslavia, and
Lubbock, Texas.

   The student artist who enraged veterans by placing
a flag on the floor of the School of the Art Institute said Saturday
that the exhibit is a revolutionary statement and he has no
apologies.
   Flanked by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, artist
``Dread'' Scott Tyler said the exhibit, titled ``What is the Proper
Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' has gone beyond the issue of free
speech to that of race and revolution.
   ``I hope it will represent the hopes and inspirations of the
oppressed minorities both here and internationally,'' said Tyler,
wearing a T-shirt that bore the logo of the rap group ``Public
Enemy.''
   Tyler called the veterans groups who have protested the exhibit
``racists and Rambos,'' and said the flag has been more a symbol of
the Ku Klux Klan and world imperialism than of minorities.
   Protests began about week after the exhibit opened Feb. 17, and
veterans and others have tried to remove the flag several times. But
a state judge has rejected a lawsuit contending the work desecrates
the flag and the exhibit remained open Saturday.
   The flag is part a minority student exhibit and features the flag
positioned on the floor so that viewers are likely to step on it
while writing comments in a guest book. The exhibit also shows
photos of flag-draped coffins and South Koreans burning the flag.
   ``Apparently Ayatollah (Ruhollah) Khomeini isn't the only one who
thinks artists ... deserve a death sentence,'' Tyler said, referring
to the Iranian leader's condemnation of author Salman Rushdie for
the novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Tyler, 24, said he and his mother have received a number of death
threats. He planned to lead a rally of supporters Saturday at the
Art Institute but backed out fearing for his safety.
   At the rally, about 30 students surrounded by police barricades
chanted: ``Mandatory patriotism we say no; the thought police have
got to go.''
   ``It is not desecrating the symbol'' by placing it on the floor,
shouted Kate Donley, 16. ``It is elevating the symbol. That's what
freedom of speech is about.''
   About the same number of veterans and their supporters, also
surrounded by barricades, waved flags and signs asking drivers on
busy Michigan Avenue to honk in support of attempts to end the
display.
   ``The American flag is at stake,'' said Dan Calin, 63, a veteran
of World War II. ``Freedom of expression yes, but not when it's our
flag. It's an insult.''

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two dozen nations Saturday agreed
to enlist the United Nations as the world's environmental watchdog
but decided against arming it with the weapon of economic sanctions.
   Presidents, premiers and ministry-level officials from 24
countries signed a document they stressed was a political
declaration rather than a legally binding commitment.
   It agrees to set up a ``new institutional authority'' in the
United Nations to ``develop instruments and define standards'' to
combat atmospheric pollution.
   The body could take unspecified ``appropriate measures'' to
enforce its decisions, the document said.
   That phrasing differed from an earlier text giving the United
Nations authority to impose ``economic sanctions ... on goods
produced under conditions with negative impact for the atmosphere.''
   ``We should avoid accentuating (the idea of) penalties,'' Dutch
Premier Ruud Lubbers told reporters.
   ``We stuck to the word `measures' because we need a good balance
between measures in terms of penalties and measures in terms of
assistance'' to help countries comply with the U.N. rules, he said.
   The International Court of Justice, the U.N. judicial arm based
in The Hague, would be the ultimate authority to settle disputes,
according to the document.
   At issue in the gathering was the gradual heating of the earth's
atmosphere known as the ``greenhouse effect,'' and the depletion of
the globe's protective ozone shield, which filters out
cancer-causing radiation from the sun.
   ``What we call for is unprecedented,'' said Norway's premier, Gro
Harlem Brundtland. She organized the conference with Lubbers and
French Premier Michel Rocard.
   ``If we don't begin immediately, life on earth will be impossible
chemically in three centuries' time,'' Rocard said. ``But if we
begin immediately, we need not panic.''
   Other key figures included King Hussein of Jordan, and presidents
Francois Mitterrand of France and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
   Also present for Saturday's signing ceremony were Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of West Germany, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe,
Premier Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, and President Daniel arap Moi of
Kenya.
   Other signatories are Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ivory Coast,
Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malta, New Zealand,
Senegal, Sweden, Tunisia and Venezuela.
   The document said Third World countries where pollution-fighting
measures would be ``an abnormal or special burden'' should get
financial aid.
   A Western diplomat told The Associated Press several Third World
nations privately had demanded a blanket guarantee the West would
shoulder most of the financial burden.
   Charles Secrett, a spokesman for the Friends of the Earth
environmentalist group, said of the gathering, ``There's a real
danger of (political) leaders jumping on the environmental bandwagon
to show how `green' they are.''
   Earlier this month, the 12-nation European Community agreed to
phase out by 1999 all production of chlorofluorocarbons, the
chemicals that deplete the ozone layer.
   In Hong Kong on Saturday, the government of the British colony
said it is drafting legislation to reduce imports of
chlorofluorocarbons and ban their production.
   Many aerosol spray cans and domestic refrigerators contain the
harmful gases, which also are used in the electronics and plastics
industries.

   The Palestinian uprising cost Israel $666
million in 1988 and nearly wiped out its economic growth, and it may
exact a similar toll this year, a Cabinet minister was quoted
Saturday as saying.
   Gad Yaacobi blamed the losses on higher military spending,
reduced production, and lost tourism and foreign investment.
Yaacobi, of the left-leaning Labor Party, was economics minister
until November, when he became communications minister.
   Arab reports said four Palestinians were wounded in clashes with
troops Saturday. The army confirmed two injuries.
   Israel radio quoted Yaacobi as saying Israel's $35 billion
economy grew 1 percent last year, instead of a forecasted 2.5
percent. In 1987, it grew 5 percent.
   At the same time, the value of goods and services in the occupied
lands shrunk from $1.5 billion in 1987 to $1.2 billion, according to
Palestinian economist Samir Abdullah.
   Also Saturday, Israel television reported authorities plan
gradually to reopen the 1,200 West Bank schools, shut for most of
the 15-month uprising.
   Olivier Rafowicz, spokesman for the military government, said
they would decide later this week. ``We want to reopen the schools,
but we want to be sure this is not accompanied by violence,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, meanwhile, said Palestinian
leaders have expressed support for his proposal to hold elections in
the occupied territories to choose a delegation for direct peace
talks with Israel.
   ``I have received hints that the approach I proposed appeals to
not just a small number of the leading figures among the residents
of the (occupied) territories,'' Rabin said in an interview Israel
radio broadcast Saturday.
   His remarks came after leading Palestinians rejected the plan,
saying the Palestine Liberation Organization is their sole
representative and elections only can be held after Israel withdraws.
   ``The people here will not elect a leadership to be in
competition with the PLO,'' Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij, a political
moderate, said Saturday. ``It will only drive a wedge between us and
our brothers on the outside.''
   Four Palestinians, including a 12-year-old boy, were shot and
wounded in Saturday clashes with Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip,
Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed two wounded.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, 394 Palestinians have been
killed. Seventeen Israelis have died.
   Rabin outlined a troop redeployment plan to ``reduce the burden''
of reserve soldiers by cutting their duties from a maximum of 62
days a year to 44 days.
   ``In Gaza and the West Bank, regular forces and fewer reserve
troops will serve in areas known as trouble spots,'' Rabin said. In
addition, specially trained border police units will take over some
areas.
   The radio interview was broadcast a day after the army shifted
some troops out of Gaza Strip refugee camps. It marks a shift in
government policy from emphasizing a widespread army presence to
using fewer, but better-trained anti-riot units.
   The redeployment also came as Foreign Minister Moshe Arens left
for a 10-day visit to the United States, where he is expected to
encounter pressure to reduce friction in the occupied lands.
   Rabin denied troops were redeployed to appease the United States.
``There is no connection to whether the Americans want this or
not,'' he said.

<HEAD>Yazov Says Vienna Talks Can Spur Strategic Weapons Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense minister was quoted as saying Saturday
that new East-West talks on cutting conventional weapons and
increasing European security should spur reductions in strategic and
chemical weapons.
   ``We hope that the beginning of the Vienna negotiations will
boost the general disarmament process, specifically negotiations on
50 percent cuts in Soviet and U.S. strategic weapons and on a
convention to ban and eliminate chemical weapons,'' the official
Tass news agency quoted Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov as saying
in an interview.
   ``This process should also involve tactical nuclear weapons and
naval forces, and confidence- and security-building measures should
be extended not only to ground troops but also to the navies and
independent air force activities,'' he told Tass.
   The Vienna talks between the 16 nations of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the seven countries of the Warsaw Pact began
Thursday.
   Warsaw Pact states proposed a reduction of 10 percent to 15
percent below the lowest level of arms held by either side in the
first phase of conventional arms reductions. Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze has insisted the talks also cover aircraft,
an area in which the Soviets contend the West has an advantage.
   The Western alliance called for extensive cuts in East bloc
battle tanks, artillery, and armored troop carriers, which it
considers the key forces that could be used for an invasion or
surprise attack on Western Europe.
   NATO has offered to make smaller cuts in those categories.
   The United States and the Soviet Union agreed in 1987 to
eliminate their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles, but
subsequent talks bogged down on a proposed cut in strategic weapons.
   The Soviet Union has said it is eager for progress in that field,
but understands the administration of President Bush will need time
to put together a negotiating position.
   Yazov said parallel Vienna talks on conventional weapons and
better monitoring facilities to build confidence in Europe ``offer
the possibility of moving toward durable security in Europe on a
larger scale, combining limitations of and reductions in armed
forces and armaments with more openness with regard to military
activities under strict control.''
   Both sides in the conventional arms talks have called for tough
verification measures to ensure the opponent is not cheating.

   A lawyer was arrested Saturday on extortion
and perjury charges in the July 1988 kidnapping of the elderly wife
of a multimillionaire former business associate, federal authorities
said.
   Newton Alfred Winn, 64, of St. Petersburg, Fla., was arrested in
a parking lot in De Land, Fla., said Wayne Taylor, agent in charge
of the FBI in Mississippi.
   Taylor said there is no information on the whereabouts of Annie
Laurie Hearin, 72, wife of businessman Robert Hearin, who was
abducted from the couple's Jackson home July 26.
   No trace of her has been found, except for a letter in her
handwriting, postmarked Atlanta, sent to Hearin a couple of weeks
after her disappearance that urged him to comply with a ransom note
left when she was abducted.
   Winn was charged with extortion in connection with the mailing of
that letter, Taylor said. He also faces charges of lying to a
federal grand jury on Aug. 3, when he denied any knowledge of the
disappearance, the agent said.
   When asked if Winn was a suspect in the actual disappearance of
Mrs. Hearin, Taylor would say only that ``he has been arrested on
extortion and perjury charges.''
   ``We intend to pursue the kidnapping aspect of the investigation
just as intensely as we ever have,'' he said. ``And the same applies
to the efforts to locate Mrs. Hearin.''
   Taylor said Hearin, who did not attend the news conference, ``was
pleased with the progress'' made in the case. The family, which also
includes two grown children, had pleaded for Mrs. Hearin's release,
saying she needed medication for a potentially fatal intestinal
ailment.
   Winn was held in Baker County Jail in MacClenny, Fla., and was
scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate in Jacksonville,
Fla., on Monday, the FBI said. Authorities say he will then be
brought to Jackson.
   He was one of 12 people named in a crudely phrased, typewritten
ransom note found at the Hearins home shortly after Mrs. Hearin
disappeared. The note said Hearin had wronged the 12 and demanded
that Hearin pay an unspecified amount of money to them.
   All of them are current or former franchisers with School
Pictures of Mississippi. Hearin was once its largest stockholder and
remains on its board of directors. The company, which takes
classroom photos, sued Winn and the other 11 in the early 1980s,
claiming the franchisers owed money from loans, materials, and film
processing fees.
   The day after getting the letter from his wife urging him to
comply with the ransom note, Hearin reportedly paid nearly $1
million total to the 12, calculating the amounts sent to each based
on how much was involved in the lawsuits. Several of the 12,
including Winn, returned the money, Taylor said.
   After Winn was sued by School Pictures in 1983, he was ordered to
pay $153,000. After that, he and School Pictures continued to battle
in court because he failed to pay the judgment against him,
according to a statement released by the FBI. An eviction hearing
had been scheduled for Aug. 8, in Clearwater, Fla., to remove Winn
from his home and office.
   Taylor said that the FBI investigators concluded that Winn paid a
woman friend to mail a letter for him outside the state of Florida.
The woman had been misled about what the letter contained and was
not arrested, he said.
   Hearin's worth reportedly exceeds $100 million. In addition to
being co-owner of Mississippi Valley Gas Co., he and his partner,
New Jersey oil man Leon Hess, own controlling interest in Lamar Life
Corp., a Mississippi-based insurance company that also has bank
holdings.
   NBC's series ``Unsolved Mysteries'' aired a segment on the
kidnapping last fall.

   The space shuttle Discovery's
countdown was running smoothly Saturday and back on schedule for
Monday's launch, after high wind stalled the countdown for seven
hours during the night.
   There were no reasons to believe the launch would not go as
scheduled, said Robert Crippen, NASA's deputy director of shuttle
operations.
   ``We don't have any significant issues that we are working,''
Crippen said after a Saturday afternoon mission management meeting.
He added that the weather was expected to cooperate for Monday's
liftoff.
   Launch preparations were stalled for seven hours after wind
gusting to 40 mph slowed some of the final maintenance and testing
on Discovery late Friday. Loading of liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel
for the spacecraft's electricity generating fuel cells, scheduled to
have started at midnight, was delayed until 7 a.m. Saturday.
   Ronald L. Phelps, launch preparation test director, said the
countdown schedule had a planned eight-hour hold. That hold was
reduced to one hour, and workmen cleared the launch pad and began
loading propellants.
   By then the wind had calmed considerably.
   ``Losing those seven hours really didn't hurt us much,'' Phelps
said. Despite the problems, he said, the countdown has ``been one of
the smoothest'' ever.
   Discovery's liftoff is set for 8:07 a.m. Monday. Forecasters
predicted improving weather through the weekend with clear skies and
calm winds by launch time.
   Once in orbit, the crew of five will deploy a $100 million
communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments during
five days in orbit.
   Monday's launch will be the third since NASA's shuttle flights
resumed after the hiatus that followed the explosion of the shuttle
Challenger in January 1986.
   Discovery's commander, Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats, and his
pilot, Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, practiced shuttle landings
early Saturday in a training aircraft modified to handle like the
shuttle. All of the crewmen later spent an hour flying T-38 jets.
   Others on the crew are Marine Col. James F. Buchli, Marine Col.
Robert C. Springer, and Dr. James P. Bagian, a physician.
   The astronauts arrived at the Florida spaceport Friday and said
that after a four-year wait they were ready for orbit.
   The crew originally was named in 1985 to fly a mission the
following year. But the Challenger explosion that killed seven
astronauts delayed all shuttle flights.
   Discovery's launch is the first of seven scheduled this year.
NASA hopes for routine, monthly shuttle flights by 1992.

   Administration officials were close-mouthed
about the San Diego car bombing that triggered speculation about
possible terrorism, as President Bush monitored developments through
news accounts, a source said Saturday.
   While FBI headquarters dispatched a special explosive team to
California, Bush headed to the presidential retreat at Camp David,
Md., for the weekend. He was briefed on the explosion Friday before
he left Washington, said Andrew Card, deputy to the chief of staff.
   ``He's monitoring the news accounts. He's concerned about it,''
said another White House official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``Proper agencies of the government are playing their
role. There's not any reason for the White House to become
involved,'' because the case is under investigation by the FBI, the
source added.
   ``We're obviously watching it and concerned about it,'' the
source said.
   Officially, the White House was mum on the situation, referring
all calls to the FBI.
   ``We don't have any information on it ... We won't have any
comment until the FBI completes its investigation,'' said White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   FBI headquarters in the capital sent its explosive team to San
Diego Friday night to help investigators looking into the explosion,
which destroyed a car driven by the wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers
III, said FBI duty officer Kathy Kennedy.
   Sharon Rogers escaped injury. Rogers was the skipper of the USS
Vincennes who mistakenly ordered the downing of an Iranian airliner,
which led to speculation that Friday's bombing may have been a
retribution act.
   ``When anything like this happens we're not going to rule
terrorism out, that perhaps this might be a retribution,'' said
Kennedy. ``But we're going to look at all the angles.''
   ``Obviously ... we investigate terrorism.''
   The explosion engulfed the van in flames moments after Mrs.
Rogers, 50, got out.
   Two days before the San Diego explosion, FBI official Oliver
``Buck'' Revell told Congress that thousands of ``zealous'' Iranian
students in the United States pose a threat of violence against
publishers and others over the controversial novel, ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Revell, testifying about Ayatollah Khomeini's death threat
against the book's author, Salman Rushdie, said some Iranians are
``zealous adherents to the Khomeini rhetoric ... and pursuit of
violence.'' Revell, the executive assistant investigations director
of the FBI, said some 30,000 Iranian citizens are in the United
States on student visas, and at least that many more are in the
country illegally. Some 10,000 to 15,000 are activists with
sympathies for Khomeini's fundamentalist Shiite regime, he said.
   Some have known links to Iranian terrorist and intelligence
networks and are routinely tracked by the bureau, Revell told the
Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism.

   Labor rallies boosted the spirits of striking
Eastern Airlines workers Saturday while the struggling carrier
attracted travelers ``like gangbusters'' to its bargain Northeast
shuttle and worked to restore routes.
   Aircraft were again reported flying near capacity on the second
day of $12 fares on the Northeast shuttle linking New York with
Washington and Boston, once Eastern's most profitable service. The
pre-strike fare was $99.
   ``The shuttle's going like gangbusters,'' said Eastern spokesman
Robin Matell. ``This ($12 fare) has just created a tremendous
groundswell of interest in traveling between the cities.''
   Joe Scott, an Eastern spokesman in New York, said the shuttle
remained popular Saturday, but ticket lines at LaGuardia Airport
were not as long as they were Friday.
   Many flights were crowded with college students heading home for
spring break. Because the hourly shuttle works on a first-come,
first-serve basis, many passengers waited for hours before getting
on a flight.
   Matell suggested the solidarity of pilots honoring Machinists
union picket lines might be cracking. ``We have more than 200 pilots
now, and yesterday we had inquiries from about 300 pilots inquiring
about procedures for returning to work,'' he said.
   But Air Line Pilots Association spokesman Jim Bost, an Eastern
pilot for four years, discounted that report, saying: ``So far they
are still hanging tight with us. As far as we can tell the line is
still holding solid.''
   Machinists leader Frank Ortis said the pickets' resolve was
unwavering, despite urgings from Eastern to return to work.
   ``Management is calling people to go to work, saying it's all
over,'' Ortis said. ``This is company rhetoric, and we're telling
members disregard that _ we're still on strike.''
   Meanwhile, corporate shuffling by Eastern parent Texas Air Corp.
continued as Eastern Express, a non-union commuter carrier that fed
Eastern flights, was renamed Continental Express. Non-union
Continental Airlines, another Texas Air company, has picked up some
Eastern routes since the strike began March 4.
   Picketing continued at airports in Miami, New York, Washington
and other cities.
   At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, civil rights leader
Jesse Jackson joined machinists, pilots and flight attendants on
picket lines for about 10 minutes, donning pilots' caps, shaking
hands and kissing babies. About 1,000 people attended a related
rally.
   ``I intend to march until victory is won,'' said Jackson, who got
a rousing reaction Thursday from Eastern strikers in Miami. ``I
don't know of any airplanes that fly in reverse.''
   Ed Weiss, an Eastern pilot for 10 years, was among about 200
people who linked hands along the main service road at the Greater
Buffalo (N.Y.) International Airport in a gesture of labor unity.
   ``We're out to show the public that we are firm and standing
strong and we will prevail,'' Weiss said.
   The AFL-CIO announced Saturday in Washington the establishment of
a relief fund to help union members at Eastern and said it reached
$250,000 almost immediately. It started with an AFL-CIO contribution
of $100,000, followed by $50,000 from the United Auto Workers and
$100,000 from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland sent a letter to other affiliated
unions and state and local federations seeking contributions to what
was named the Fairness at Eastern fund.
   In Miami, striking employees were joined by their families for
picket duty at Eastern headquarters, and a food drive was organized
for union members who are ineligible for unemployment under Florida
law because they went on strike rather than agree to contract
concessions.
   ``I know some people are really hurting as far as paychecks, but
we all knew this was going to happen,'' said mechanic Les Davison,
picketing with his 6-year-old daughter Christina, who sported an
anti-Frank Lorenzo sticker targeting Texas Air's chairman on her
frilly pink dress.
   Terry Cullen, a veteran flight attendant picketing with her
husband and 5-year-old daughter, said their creditors have been
understanding.
   ``Almost everybody I've talked to when they hear Eastern says
we'll sit down and work with you,'' Mrs. Cullen said.
   After being all but shut down at the beginning of the week-old
strike, Eastern was preparing to resume 40 round-trip flights Sunday
and Monday, including service to 13 Latin American cities from Miami.
   ``We'll just play it slowly and conservatively and see how the
operation is going and add in increments,'' Matell said.
   The Machinists union was drafting its legal response to Eastern's
Chapter 11 financial reorganization petition filed Thursday at U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York.
   Under that filing, paychecks for all but the carrier's 1,500
remaining employees have been held up. The 8,500 Machinists were
scheduled to be paid Friday.
   Machinists attorney Robert Clayman said documents would be filed
soon at the court to ``correct the pay situation and make sure these
employees get paid as quickly as possible.''
   Workers suffered fresh blows Friday when Eastern confirmed that
medical coverage had been suspended for 600 workers and at least
four South Florida store chains refused to accept checks drawn on
the Eastern Airlines Federal Credit Union, which is unaffected by
the strike.
   Officials at the credit union, which has $875 million in assets,
reported withdrawals have been slightly above normal. Of 135,000
members, 30,000 are Eastern workers.
   ``My husband told me to get all my money and put it in a bank,''
said Alicia Barroso, an Eastern accounting clerk who withdrew money
Friday.

<HEAD>Navy Cruiser Cowpens Launched At Bath Iron Works</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATH, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy's new guided-missile cruiser Cowpens
was launched Saturday at the Bath Iron Works.
   The cruiser, the latest in the Ticonderoga class, is named after
the Revolutionary War battle that was fought on Jan. 17, 1781, near
Cowpens, S.C. It is the second Navy ship to bear the name.
   Navy Secretary William L. Ball Jr., a South Carolina native,
praised the launching as the latest in ``an unbroken series of
successes'' in the service's Aegis cruiser program.
   The Cowpens, he said, ``represents revitalization of the Navy and
the restoration of national pride.''
   A delegation of congressional representatives from South Carolina
also attended the launching.
   The cruiser Cowpens is 567 feet long, 55 feet wide and displaces
about 9,600 tons. Considered the most sophisticated air-defense ship
in the world, the cruiser will carry a unique wrap-around radar
system that allows it to ``see'' in all directions at once.
   The Cowpens is the fifth Aegis cruiser to be launched by the Bath
Iron Works, and is to join the Monterey and Normandy at the
shipyard's outfitting piers.
   A crowd estimated at about 3,000 attended the launching along the
blustery banks of the Kennebec River.

<TEXT>
   A maverick Communist leader said Saturday that just
four men decided to send troops into Afghanistan _ President Leonid
Brezhnev, Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov, Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko and Politburo ideologist Michael Suslov.
   It has long been reported that only a handful of members of the
ruling Politburo were involved in the fateful decision that sent
15,000 Soviet soldiers to their deaths in Afghanistan.
   But Boris Yeltsin, a former candidate member of the Politburo who
was demoted from Moscow Communist Party chief after criticizing the
leadership, was the first official to name the individuals.
   Yeltsin's revelation came in a speech Saturday before 800 people
at the Kuntsevo Theater, where he was campaigning for the new
Congress of People's Deputies. He did not give his source, but he
likely would have been one of the first let in on the secret. He
remains one of the 300-odd members of the Communist Party's
policy-making Central Committee.
   Other members of the Central Committee said last year they did
not know who was responsible. But the subject suddenly was opened to
discussion in February when the Soviet troops left Afghanistan after
nine years of war.
   The four men Yeltsin identified were all top Kremlin power
brokers in 1979, and likely candidates for a coterie close-knit and
powerful enough to make such a drastic decision.
   Brezhnev, then 73, held the top positions in both the government
and the Communist Party _ president and party general secretary.
Gromyko, then 70, had ruled the Foreign Ministry for 22 years.
   Gen. Ustinov, then 71, was both minister of defense and marshal
of the army. And Suslov, then 77, was the Politburo member in charge
of ideology who took on a number of Brezhnev's duties in 1979.
   Gromyko retired from the presidency and the Politburo last
autumn; Brezhnev and Suslov died in 1982 and Ustinov died in 1984.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda raised official doubts about the
wisdom of intervening in Afghanistan in a front-page article Feb.
15, the day the last Soviet soldier came home.
   ``It is possible to doubt the Brezhnev leadership's evaluation of
the level of military threat,'' Pravda said. ``Such vitally
important decisions as the use of troops cannot be decided secretly
by a small circle of people, without the sanction of the
Parliament.''
   Yeltsin said Saturday that Brezhnev, Gromyko, Ustinov, and Suslov
made the fateful decision ``and then told the Politburo.''
   The Politburo is the ruling body in the Soviet Communist Party's
oligarchy, and its members, then 14, would have been expected to
take such an important step as a group.
   ``If the people had decided, there would have been a different
decision,'' Yeltsin said in explaining his campaign call for a
referendum law in the Soviet Union. Instead, 15,000 Soviet soldiers
died and, in the end, the Soviet Union didn't win the war, he said.
   Yeltsin was ousted as Moscow Communist Party leader in 1987 after
his harsh attacks on corruption angered too many people. He is now
first deputy chairman of the State Construction Committee.
   Yeltsin is running against the director of a Moscow auto factory
in the first multi-candidate national elections in Soviet history.
He called for more rapid economic reform and cancellation of all
privileges enjoyed by the elite, particularly access to hard-to-find
goods and services.
   ``If we lack something, then workers, government ministers and
the general secretary should lack the same things.'' he said to loud
applause.

   For the second time this year, a Washington
D.C.-area resident has claimed a ``Lotto America'' jackpot prize,
district lottery officials said Saturday.
   ``Lightning can strike the same place twice,'' said Lorraine A.
Green, district lottery executive director.
   Conrad Yanguba, 40, a computer operator from Prince George's
County, Md., won $3 million in the March 4 drawing in the Des
Moines, Iowa-based lottery.
   Yanguba did not attend Saturday's press conference because of
``family commitments,'' lottery officials said. His winning numbers
were 3-9-24-33-37-49. Yanguba will receive 20 annual payments of
$150,000 before state and federal taxes.
   He is the second area lottery player to win at Lotto America
since the game began in February 1988. The first winner, Lee Nelson
of Alexandria, Va., won $16 million in the Feb. 18 drawing.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell Saturday on the high country of the Nevada-California
border, while warm weather elsewhere melted snow and caused local
flooding.
   Wind gusted to 70 mph south of Reno, Nev., during the morning as
a result of a strong cold front which left 6 inches of snow
overnight at higher elevations of the Tahoe Valley along the
Nevada-California border, and about 2 inches of snow at lower levels
near Lake Tahoe.
   Unseasonably warm temperatures elsewhere melted snow cover and
there was flooding on the Big Muddy River at Murphysboro, Ill., the
National Weather Service said.
   Melting snow also added to problems at Hooper, Neb., where an ice
jam caused local flooding.
   Other streams for which warnings were posted include the
Pecatonica River in southwestern Wisconsin; the Weiser River near
Weiser, Idaho; the John Day River at Service Creek, Ore.; and the
Umitilla River at Pendleton, Ore.
   Elsewhere, light rain was scattered over North Dakota at noon,
and showers were widely scattered over the northern coast of
California. Rain and freezing rain extended over northern and
western Montana.
   Afternoon temperatures were much warmer than normal for mid-March
over much of the Plains, and from Arizona across southeastern Idaho.
   Record highs for the date included 89 at Amarillo, Texas; 71 at
Cheyenne, Wyo.; 87 at Lubbock, Texas; and 82 at Pueblo, Colo.
   Temperatures only hit the upper 50s in Michigan but people took
advantage of the break, with more than 500 golfers turning out by
noon at the Maple Lane Golf Course in Sterling Heights, said golf
pro Linc Jackson.
   ``It's more like a Saturday in early May,'' Detroit Zoo cashier
Gwen Lanier said of attendance.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 21
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 92 at Childress, Texas. Saturday's
low for the Lower 48 states was 4 degrees below zero at Houlton,
Maine.
   For Sunday, scattered snow showers were forecast over northern
New England and northeastern New York state. Showers were forecast
along the northern Pacific Coast, and over northwestern Montana.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted over northern Maine, Upper
Michigan and northeastern Minnesota; in the 30s and 40s from the
remainder of New England across the remainder of the Great Lakes,
the upper Mississippi Valley, North Dakota, the northeastern half of
South Dakota and northeastern Montana; in the 50s and 60s from New
Jersey and the remainder of New York state across North Carolina,
the Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley, the middle Mississippi
Valley, the central Plains, the remainder of South Dakota, the
Rockies, the Great Basin, the northern Plateau and the northern
two-thirds of the Pacific Coast; in the 90s over north-central
through central Texas, and from southwestern Texas across southern
Arizona; and generally in the 70s and 80s elsewhere around the
nation.

<HEAD>Man Says Threat To Blow Up Poet's Tomb Was A Joke</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAVENNA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested a retired merchant who
allegedly threatened to blow up the poet Dante's tomb, but the man
said his threatening letters were just a joke, police said Saturday.
   A police investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the letters from the man in Ravenna threatened to blow up the tomb
because Dante supposedly blasphemed the prophet Mohammed in his
classic ``Divine Comedy,'' written more than 650 years ago.
   The retired merchant arrested Thursday admitted writing the
threatening letters ``only as a joke and had no idea all this fuss
would have been created,'' the police official said.
   Police were posted at the tomb after Ravenna Mayor Mauro Dragone
and a newspaper received letters last week attributed to a group
called ``Guardians of the Revolution.''
   The writer of the letters said Dante, in his classic ``Divine
Comedy,'' placed the founder of Islam in hell.
   The police investigator identified the merchant as Vincenzo
Strocchi, a self-styled Dante scholar, and said authorities have not
decided whether to charge him.
   The letter to the mayor demanded that Dragone publicly announce
that Dante lied about Mohammed and that ``Divine Comedy,'' revered
as the most magnificent poetic creation in the Italian language,
should not be studied or read.
   Dante's epic, a work of more than 14,000 lines in 100 cantos,
recounts a poet's journey through hell, purgatory and heaven. It
places Mohammed in the ninth pit of hell.
   The threats to blow up Dante's tomb sparked a furor in Ravenna
because of the recent death threats made against British author
Salman Rushdie, whose novel ``The Satanic Verses'' makes references
to Islam and Mohammed that Moslems call blasphemous.
   Iranian clerics have called for Rushdie's death and have placed a
$5.2 million reward on his head.

<HEAD>U.N. Hopes To Reach Agreement On Relief Supplies To Sudanese</HEAD>

   Atan Maywin stood under the harsh sun in
front of her makeshift hut Saturday describing how her six children
died from starvation and disease as they fled the civil war in
southern Sudan.
   She arrived in this town, 460 miles southwest of the capital of
Khartom, on Thursday _ one of about 300 refugees who enter Muglad
daily seeking safety and food.
   Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled battle areas and an
international relief program under United Nations auspices hopes to
transport 170,000 tons of food and supplies to distribution points
before the rainy season starts in May.
   But there has been no agreement between relief organizers and
leaders of the rebels' Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) on
shipments of the supplies. In previous years SPLA forces have fired
at planes and trucks carrying relief supplies, saying the army was
using them to transport equipment to its troops.
   There are some 2.25 million people in southern Sudan. Last year
it is estimated that as many as 500,000 perished from war-related
causes, with many starving in isolated villages.
   James Grant, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) returned to Khartoum Saturday after a day of talks with
SPLA leaders in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.
   Grant said Gen. Lon Akol, the SPLA's second in command, asked for
time to study a proposed ``month of tranquility,'' which would
virtually amount to a cease-fire, to move relief supplies into
position.
   Grant spoke with reporters after meeting Prime Minister Sadek
Mahdi and informing him about the talks with the rebels. Mahdi's
government has accepted the relief plan.
   ``The SPLA took a strong position that there was a need for food
and that they would work to get it to their people,'' Grant said.
``We have yet to receive a formal reply.
   We are going to work with the assumption that we will get
agreement, if not on a month of tranquility, then at the very least
on bubbles of tranquility for the eight points in the plan,'' he
said.
   The eight points involve transporting aid by airlifts and truck,
train and barge convoys to both government- and rebel-held areas.
   In Addis Ababa an SPLA official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said no agreement had been reached on a cease-fire to
allow relief shipments into the south.
   The official commented on the meeting with Grant, Julia Taft,
head of the U.S. office of Foreign Disasters Assistance, and
representatives of Western donor agencies.
   ``We discussed with them recent developments in Sudan, but we did
not reach any conclusive agreement,'' the official said. The SPLA
has its headquarters in Addis Ababa.
   U.N. officials have estimated that 100,000 people might perish if
the ``month of tranquility'' operation cannot be carried out. Other
officials have said the death toll could exceed 600,000.
   The Sudanese government is dominated by Moslems and has imposed
Islamic law, while many people in the south are Christians and
animists. The SPLA took up arms against the government in 1985,
demanding autonomy and a larger share for the south of Sudan's
wealth and development.

   The main church of ruling
Afrikaners has declared apartheid a sin and asked forgiveness for
its long support of the racially discriminatory system.
   ``We confess with humility and sorrow the participation of our
church in the introduction and legitimation of the ideology of
apartheid and the subsequent suffering of people,'' said the white
Dutch Reformed Church.
   The black and mixed-race Dutch Reformed Churches welcomed the
most explicit condemnation of apartheid made by their white mother
church but said it also must work to destroy the system it helped
create.
   President P.W. Botha and virtually his entire Cabinet are among
congregants of the repenting church, which probably is
Afrikanerdom's strongest single unifying factor.
   There was no immediate reaction from the government to the
church's declaration or to a government-appointed commission's
report Saturday that called for voting rights for the black majority
and an end to all apartheid laws.
   The government has said repeatedly that it is dismantling
apartheid and wants to move away from discriminatory legislation.
However, Botha has repeatedly refused to even discuss the
possibility of a black majority government and says he is committed
to segregated schools and neighborhoods for whites.
   The white church made its statement late Friday after a weeklong
meeting between white, black and mixed-race church leaders in
Vereeniging, 38 miles south of Johannesburg.
   ``(Apartheid) cannot be accepted on Christian ethical grounds,
because it contravenes the very essence of reconciliation,
neighborly love and righteousness,'' the white church said.
   The black and mixed-race delegation said: ``It is encouraging
that there are ministers in the white DRC that call for fundamental
and comprehensive changes. But it is vital that they should embark
on acts of liberation within church and society.''
   Among the black and mixed-race leaders were some of the country's
best-known anti-apartheid figures, such as the Rev. Allan Boesak and
the Rev. Beyers Naude, one of the few white ministers who belongs to
the black church.
   They called on the white church to condemn specific
discriminatory laws and ``develop a theology counteracting
apartheid.'' They also issued a document promoting civil
disobedience, which the white church did not endorse.
   ``One cannot be a Christian and not resist apartheid,'' the
document said. ``Resistance to this evil system is both the calling
and duty of the church.''
   Piet Rossouw, a top official in the white church, said Saturday
its leaders would address such issues at a meeting this week.
   ``The important thing is that we are working together to address
the problem of discrimination and suffering,'' Rossouw said.
   With about 1 million adult members, the white Dutch Reformed
Church is by far the largest and most influential church among
Afrikaners, who make up 3 million of the country's 5 million whites.
The church opposes political activism but is in close contact with
the government behind the scenes.
   Johan Heyns, leader of the white church, told The Associated
Press late last year he recently had spoken to Botha about sensitive
political issues, including the possible release of imprisoned black
leader Nelson Mandela.
   In 1986, the church reversed its decades-old support of
segregation and said apartheid was a mistake, but it stopped short
of calling it a sin or heresy.
   At the same time, it opened membership to all races. But most
churches remain segregated because of tradition. About 50 ministers
and 30,000 congregants who believe in strict segregation have broken
away from the white church in the past three years.
   The Dutch Reformed Church provided the scriptural justification
for apartheid when the governing National Party came to power in
1948 and began codifying racial segregation. D.F. Malan, the prime
minister from 1948-54 when most apartheid laws were enacted, was a
minister in the church.
   Over the years, church leaders cited dozens of biblical passages
they said supported apartheid, under which the black majority has no
voice in national affairs. They argued biblical references to
``peoples'' and ``nations'' supported policies to preserve cultural
identity, and the right way to do this was to divide different races
into their separate ``nations.''
   About 1.1 million of the nation's 28 million blacks belong to the
black Dutch Reformed Church and 680,000 of the 3 million mixed-race
people belong to their Dutch Reformed Church.
   Also Saturday, blacks planning a sit-in at a whites-only park in
Carletonville, 45 miles west of Johannesburg, canceled the protest
after police warned organizers they would be held responsible if any
trouble broke out.
   Blacks in Carletonville have been protesting a recent town
council decision to resegregate public facilities that had been
integrated.

<TEXT>
   Most Americans approve of President Bush's
performance in office, even though they are split over whether he
should have withdrawn John Tower's name from nomination as defense
secretary, according to a Newsweek poll released Saturday.
   The copyrighted poll, conducted by the Gallup Organization,
showed that 62 percent of those interviewed said they approved of
Bush's handling of the presidency so far, compared with 16 percent
who disapproved and 22 who said they did not know.
   Thirty-two percent said Bush was performing better than they
expected, while 26 percent said he was not doing as well as they
expected and 30 percent said his performance was about what they
expected.
   Forty-six percent said he should have withdrawn Tower's
nomination and chosen someone else, while 43 percent said he handled
the nomination properly and 6 percent said he should have fought
harder on Tower's behalf. The Senate rejected Tower's nomination on
Thursday, and Bush on Friday nominated Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., for
the job.
   The Newsweek poll also said 52 percent of those questioned said
they expected economic conditions in the United States to be the
same a year from now, while 23 percent said they expected conditions
to be better and another 23 percent expected them to be worse.
   The telephone was conducted among 756 respondents on March 9-10
and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.

   Rescuers searching Saturday for the
Minnesota pilot of a small plane that plunged into the Atlantic
Ocean spotted a bright orange object that appeared to be a life
jacket.
   A search for another American whose small plane also crashed into
the Atlantic was called off.
   Todd Michaelson, 29, of Minneapolis, ditched his Piper Saratoga
into the sea about 990 miles northeast of St. John's, Newfoundland
on Wednesday after reporting engine trouble while flying to Ireland.
   A flare thought to have been fired by Michaelson, who had a
survival suit and life raft, was spotted late Wednesday night and a
seat cushion was seen Thursday.
   Rescue officials said they continued that search because of the
flare sighting.
   Rescue aircraft and commercial vessels on Friday halted the
search for a Cessna 210 that ditched in the same area 12 hours after
Michaelson's plane went down.
   Its pilot, an American in his 40s, has not been identified. His
plane also reported engine trouble while en route to Ireland.
   Capt. Patrick Phelan of the Halifax search and rescue center said
the American pilot was presumed dead. A spokesman for his employer,
Tim McCandless Inc. of Waterloo, Iowa, said the Cessna left Gander,
Newfoundland.
   ``We've determined that the possibility for survival is next to
nil right now due to the conditions during the ditch and the
temperatures and the extensive search area coverage with no
indication right now,'' said Capt. Patrick Phelan of the Halifax
Search and Rescue center.
   A U.S. Coast Guard plane and a Soviet weather ship joined a
Canadian vessel in Saturday's search for Michaelson.

   A tanker and a cargo ship collided
near the Pacific Ocean entrance of the Panama Canal and an estimated
200 tons of combustible oil spilled into coastal waters, an offical
reported Saturday.
   Jose Reyes, operations director for the National Port Authority,
told The Associated Press that port authority workers and members of
the Panamanian Defense Forces were working to clean up the spill and
to direct the oil out to sea.
   He said the accident occurred Friday when the Ecuadorean cargo
ship Isla Santay, 528 feet long and 75 feet wide, collided with the
599-foot-long, 105-foot-wide British petroleum tanker Probobravo
near Panama Bay.
   One of the Probobravo's oil tanks was ripped open, Reyes said.
   He said he did not know if the spill had damaged marine and plant
life but the collision had not affected traffic in the 50-mile-long
waterway. An average of some 33 ships pass through the canal daily.

   What's in a name? Well, that depends on
whether you consider yourself Michigander, a Michiganite, a
Michiganian _ or maybe even a bit Michiganer.
   Abraham Lincoln is said to have coined ``Michigander'' in 1848 in
a sarcastic speech. State archivists have found one 1800s reference
to ``Michiganite.'' An 1871 pamphlet referred to ``Michiganer.''
   The Associated Press in Michigan uses ``Michiganian.'' The
Detroit Free Press _ after some energetic writers conducted a poll _
endorsed ``Michigander'' and included it in its stylebook for
writers.
   State government skirts the issue. Roger Peters of the
Legislative Service Bureau said drafting experts have no policy and
tend to avoid the matter.
   In 1981, the state House debated the matter, defeating
Michigander 51-42 and selecting Michiganian for official use. But
the Senate never passed the measure.
   The only official reference experts could uncover was a 1980 law
creating a state commission to serve the aging. It included the
title: ``This act shall be known and may be cited as the older
Michiganian Act.''
   That _ absent a counterattack from 'gander backers _ apparently
has carried the day.
   ``Technically, I think Michiganian is preferred,'' said David
Anderson, professor of American thought and language at Michigan
State University. ``You're not from Michigand, you're from Michigan.
Michigander adds something that doesn't belong.''
   But, he added: ``It's not one of the pressing problems Michigan
has to solve.''

   A Detroit-area arena has a sympathetic
ear for those parents who take their children to rock concerts and
can't stand the high decibels of heavy metal music.
   The Palace, home of the Detroit Pistons basketball team,
introduced the ``Quiet Room,'' at a March 4 concert featuring the
heavy metal band Poison, said Patrick O'Connor, a spokesman for the
stadium. About 125 parents used it.
   ``We actually got a lot of calls from parents saying they were
concerned about letting their kids go to the show,'' he said. ``The
Quiet Room is a way to alleviate those concerns.''
   In the Quiet Room, parents can peacefully kill time while their
kids enjoy the show, O'Connor said. It solves the problems involved
with dropping off the children and returning to pick them up, he
said.
   Parents need not buy a ticket to use the quiet room _ actually a
banquet room. They can read, watch television, or even catch the
concert on the in-house closed-circuit monitors, he said.
   After the concert, parents catch up with offspring at a
designated meeting place, O'Connor said.
   Marilyn Desjardins, another Palace spokeswoman, said the Quiet
Room concept was adapted from a similar program at the Capital
Centre in Landover, Md. Other arenas nationwide also have quiet
rooms, she said.

   Honduran officials and rebels
fighting the Nicaraguan government will meet in Washington this week
to discuss a peace plan that includes disarming the rebels, a
Honduran official said Saturday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro said in a telephone
interview the meeting will be held Monday and Tuesday. He refused to
give further details.
   Officials in Washington could not be reached immediately for
comment.
   In February, the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras and Costa Rica agreed to the peace proposal, which includes
freeing hundreds of former Nicaraguan national guardsmen and free
and open elections in that country.
   As part of the agreement, the leaders said they would draft a
plan by May 15 to disband the 11,000-member rebel force fighting
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Most of the rebels, known as Contras, fled to border bases in
Honduras after U.S. military assistance ended last year.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a provisional truce in
March 1988.
   Castro said two senior diplomats and two army colonels will
represent the Honduran government at the Washington talks. He said
Contra leaders Adolfo Calero, Aristides Sanchez, Roberto Ferrey and
Enrique Bermudez will represent the rebels.
   Honduras has reluctantly tolerated Contras in its territory since
1981, when the rebels _ with U.S. assistance _ started battling the
Sandinistas.
   The presence of rebel supply and training bases along the border
with Nicaragua has soured relations between the two countries, and
there have been frequent clashes between soldiers from the two sides.
   On Saturday, the Nicaraguan Defense Ministry accused Honduran
troops of attacking the Nicaraguan border post of Murupuchi, 110
miles north of Managua, the Nicaraguan capital. It said the post was
attacked 13 times in February and this was the sixth in March.
   A Defense Ministry news release in Managua said Honduran troops
opened fire on the post with automatic weapons and mortars but did
not say when the attack took place or give other details.
   There was no immediate public response from the Honduran
government.
   As part of the peace initiative, the Sandinista government said
Friday it will free this month 1,984 former members of ousted
President Anastasio Somoza's national guard.
   Nicaraguan security chief Lenin Cerna said the guardsmen will be
freed after the National Assembly formally approves a pardon request
from President Daniel Ortega.
   Cerna said the guadsmen, who were jailed after the Sandinistas
overthrew Somoza in a 1979 revolution, will be free to leave the
country.

<HEAD>Gorbachev's Rival Diverges on Agricultural Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just four days before Communist Party leaders are
to revamp agricultural policy, Mikhail Gorbachev's strongest rival
on the Politburo on Saturday publicly broke with the president's
call for more individual farming.
   Yegor Ligachev, the head of the Communist Party's commission on
agriculture, characterized his preference for collective farming as
a group decision without identifying who supports him.
   Ligachev, the former ideology chief of the Communist Party who
was shifted to agriculture last fall in what was widely regarded as
a demotion, was interviewed on Soviet television during a trip to
view agriculture in Czechoslovakia.
   ``We have become convinced one more time that the basis for any
progress in food programs is actually development of collective
forms of management, such as collective farms and state farms, along
with a steady development of self-financing,'' or accounting for
profits and losses, Ligachev said.
   Such accounting is a major part of Gorbachev's reform program.
However, Ligachev did not mention Gorbachev's repeated praise for
experiments in leasing state farm land to families and small groups.
   Just last week, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told a news conference
that the Kremlin leaders intended to significantly expand family
farming through leasing of land.
   Although Ligachev was appointed by Gorbachev, he has differed
with the Soviet leader on a number of occasions.
   Czechoslovakia's agriculture is almost entirely collectivized but
operates under a much more flexible system than Soviet farms.
   The Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee, the policy-making
body of about 300 people, is scheduled to meet Wednesday to enact
drastic reforms in Soviet agriculture. Although bread is in
plentiful supply, the country is suffering serious food shortages,
with meat, cheese and sugar rationed in many cities.
   There has been evidence in recent weeks that the Kremlin
leadership is finding it difficult to agree on agricultural reform.
The central committee meeting was postponed from February into the
beginning of plowing season. Last week, the 12-member Politburo's
meeting covered agricultural reform, among other items, and ran for
two days instead of the usual one.
   The Central Committee, which meets irregularly only a few times a
year, is the only body with the power to change the leadership of
the Communist Party.

   A week of fierce fighting between
anti-communist insurgents and Afghan government forces holding a
strategic city has killed scores of people and wounded hundreds, a
guerrilla spokesman said Saturday.
   Thousands of guerrillas blasted Jalalabad in a relentless attack
with long-range rockets and heavy artillery, said Mohammad Shoaib of
the Jamiat-e-Islami insurgent group.
   The city, Afghanistan's fifth-largest, is seen by the guerrillas
as a stepping stone to the capital of Kabul, 75 miles to the west.
   ``Fighting is close to and around the city,'' said Shoaib.
``There are rumors that some mujahedeen (guerrillas) have entered
the city from the north, but there is no confirmation.''
   Several guerrilla sources said the insurgents now control a key
government garrison on the outskirts of Jalalabad, which is 45 miles
west of the border with Pakistan where many guerrilla groups are
based.
   The guerrillas captured as many as 500 government troops in the
battle for the post, said Naeem Majrooh of the Afghan Information
Center, which opposes the Marxist government.
   Majrooh said casualty figures ``are very high. Most of the deaths
are from mines and bombardments.''
   The government of Afghan President Najib said 1,500 guerrillas
had been killed in the weeklong fighting around Jalalabad. It did
not give figures for government forces.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Afghan government
forces in Jalalabad attacked the rebels with bomb strikes and
rockets, killing 350 insurgents and wounding 200. It said government
units suffered 15 killed and 12 wounded.
   Tass also said a large government convoy reached Jalalabad from
Kabul with arms, ammunition and reinforcements.
   Western journalists returning from the Afghan-Pakistani border
said a convoy of ambulances was headed for Pakistan.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross runs a hospital in
Peshawar, Pakistan, about 30 miles from the border, and the staff
reportedly was working around the clock treating war wounded.
   Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said
nine rockets hit the capital Saturday, killing one person and
injuring another.
   The Tass dispatch said a Soviet civilian jet of the Aeroflot
airline was slightly damaged in a rocket attack on Kabul airport.
   It did not say if the plane was on the ground or in the air or if
there were any casualties, but it said the rockets killed an
unspecified number of people in residential buildings mear the
airport.
   Najib asked the United States and the Soviet Union to intervene
to stop the fighting, according to a radio report Friday.
   The United States, Pakistan and Iran have aided the guerrillas.
The Soviets in February withdrew the last of their troops from
Afghanistan after nine years of intervention in support of the
government.
   Boris Yelstin, the former Moscow Communist Party chief, revealed
Saturday in a speech that only four men made the fateful decision to
send Soviet troops into Afghanistan: President Leonid Brezhnev,
Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and
Politburo ideologist Michael Suslov.
   Yeltsin, who was demoted from Moscow party chief after
criticizing the party leadership, was the first official to name the
individuals involved in the decision, which led to the deaths of
15,000 Soviet troops. It had long been believed that only a few top
officials were involved.
   The guerrillas have been fighting the government since a Marxist
coup in 1978 and have vowed to overthrow Najib now that the Soviets
are gone.
   They recently formed an interim government and on Friday held
their first Cabinet meeting inside Afghanistan, about seven miles
from the border in eastern Paktia province.
   An alliance of seven guerrilla groups that operates from
Peshawar, Pakistan, formed the government with hopes it will
eventually replace Najib's.
   Sudan on Saturday extended formal recognition to the rebel
government.
   The move made Sudan the second country, after Saudi Arabia, to
recognize the government.
   Malaysia's foreign minister said Saturday his country will
propose that other Moslem countries recognize the guerrilla
government at the Organization of Islamic Conference meeting in
Saudi Arabia on Monday.
   Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar said he would present the
proposal at the conference.

   Federal agents with brooms and metal detectors
focused Saturday on the burned-out wreckage of a van driven by the
wife of the Navy captain who mistakenly ordered the destruction of
an Iranian passenger jet.
   Officials said the case was being investigated as a possible
terrorist attack.
   The home of Capt. Will Rogers III, commander of the USS
Vincennes, was sealed off and he and his wife, Sharon, were in
hiding. Officials confirmed the couple received at least one
threatening call about the missile strike on the airliner.
   The van remained in the cordoned-off intersection where it
exploded and burned Friday, moments after Mrs. Rogers got out when
she heard a noise witnesses described as ``two loud pops.''
   There also was increased security at the several military
facilities in San Diego, the nation's largest Navy complex.
   The van was the center of intense scrutiny Saturday by
investigators from the FBI and other federal agencies, who had a
command post set up nearby.
   ``We are into an exhaustive, painstaking, lengthy investigation
to determine what type of bomb it was, what was used in it, how it
was detonated,'' said Thomas Hughes, agent in charge of the San
Diego FBI office. ``There are fragments ... that would lead one to
believe this was a pipe bomb.''
   However, he said at a briefing Saturday that it had still not
been determined whether it was a pipe bomb.
   Investigators set up barrels covered with sieves and sifted
through debris collected from the area shortly after Friday's
explosion. Other investigators swept beds of plants lining the
avenue with metal detectors.
   The debris will be taken to a lab in Washington. Bomb analysts
from the Los Angeles FBI office and the Washington FBI explosives
unit were at the scene.
   The roofs of buildings in the area also were being searched for
any kind of evidence, Hughes said.
   ``Teams of investigators are running out just hundreds and
hundreds of leads,'' Hughes said.
   He said the Rogerses were being kept in a secure location. Their
son, who attends school in upstate New York, was notified and
offered protection, the FBI said.
   Hughes declined to comment when asked about a report that a red
car was seen behind Mrs. Rogers' van and made a quick U-turn after
the explosion.
   Rogers, who joined his wife at a nearby police station after the
bombing, had driven the van earlier Friday, The New York Times
quoted a Bush administration official as saying.
   The couple's home was kept behind a security seal, with
authorities blocking the street so far away that the house was not
visible to reporters.
   Three official-looking vehicles with heavily tinted windows were
allowed through the barricade Saturday.
   A Justice Department source in Washington who spoke on condition
of anonymity said investigators suspect the bombing was the work of
terrorists. However, local FBI investigators would not confirm that
theory.
   ``This could have been perpetrated for some other reason unknown
at this time,'' Hughes cautioned.
   ``When anything like this happens we're not going to rule
terrorism out, that perhaps this might be a retribution,'' said FBI
duty officer Kathy Kennedy in Washington. ``But we're going to look
at all the angles.''
   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for an all-out war
against the United States after the Iran Air passenger plane was
shot down.
   Some members of the Iranian Reolutionary Guards have entered the
United States as students, Oliver B. Revell, executive assistant
director of the FBI, said earlier in the week. He said there was a
``hard core'' of 200 to 300 Iranians who were of concern to his
agency.
   No White House comment was planned until the FBI completes its
investigation, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Saturday.
   President Bush was ``monitoring the news accounts. He's concerned
about it,'' said another White House official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   FBI spokesman Michael Kortan said no incidents linked to Mideast
terrorists have occurred in this country since 1983, when FBI
Director William Webster said the agency had stopped an attempt by
Iranians to bomb a Seattle theater occupied by Iranian opponents of
Khomeini's regime. Seattle Mayor Charles Royer said city police were
informed of the possibility of a threat but ``nothing happened.''
   Last July 3, in the Persian Gulf, the guided-missile cruiser
Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats.
   During the battle, an aircraft that Rogers thought was an Iranian
F-14 fighter appeared on the U.S. warship's advanced radar. After
the plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military
channels, Rogers gave the order to shoot it down.
   The aircraft was actually an Iranian civilian jet with 290 people
aboard. All aboard were killed.
   Rogers later said he regretted the deaths but that his decision
was made in defense of his ship and crew. He was backed by the
Reagan administration, which also decided to compensate the victims'
families.
   Mrs. Rogers received a threatening call last July from someone
she guessed might have been Middle Eastern, The New York Times
reported Saturday, quoting an unidentified Pentagon official. The
caller gave her the name of an organization that was unfamiliar to
her and said, ``Are you the wife of the murderer?'' frightening Mrs.
Rogers into hanging up, the newspaper said.
   The Navy found no indication that the named organization existed,
the Times said.
   An unidentified Justice Department source told The San Diego
Union that Rogers and his family received at least two telephoned
death threats from callers who said they were acting in response to
the jetliner's destruction.
   The Union said Rogers received one of the calls 24 hours before
the December bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. There
has been speculation on whether that bombing was in retaliation for
the Vincennes' action.
   Navy Cmdr. David Dillon, acting as a spokesman for the couple,
said Mrs. Rogers received a threatening phone call shortly after the
airliner's destruction.
   The Vincennes has been at San Diego, its home port, since
October, except for several short training missions, Chief Craig
Huebler, spokesman for the San Diego Naval Base, said Saturday.
   He confirmed security was tighter at military installations in
the area, but declined to give specifics.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., spoke with the Rogerses on Friday.
``Mrs. Rogers said, `Thank God this did not happen on Thursday'
because she was carrying six children in the van that morning.'' She
teaches fourth grade at La Jolla Country Day School.

<HEAD>Hypothermal Musher Rescued in Dog-Sled Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAYLING, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A helicopter crew flew to a remote
encampment Saturday to rescue a competitor in the Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race who was reported to be suffering from hypothermia and
shock.
   Mike Madden, 27, of North Pole, was rescued by a military
helicopter at about 9:30 a.m., eight hours after fellow musher Jerry
Austin told race officials that Madden needed help, members of the
race board said.
   Madden was 30 miles east of the checkpoint at Iditarod, which
marks the half-way point of the 1,168 mile race. Race officials said
Madden's condition stabilized after he was flown to McGrath en route
to an Anchorage hospital.
   The National Weather Service in Anchorage said the low
temperature in Iditarod early Saturday was probably about 5 degrees.
   An HH-3 ``Jolly Green Giant'' helicopter from Elmendorf Air Force
Base flew a doctor, accompanied by Austin, to help Madden, who also
was reported to have injured his knee while chopping dogfood earlier
in the race.
   Austin intended to take care of Madden's dogs after the
evacuation, said Leo Rasmussen, president of the Iditarod board. The
detour was a setback for Austin, who has already been hampered by
sick dogs.
   ``It destroys his chances for a top 20 finish, and will probably
make him one of the last teams to come into Nome,'' race board
member Tom Busch said. Busch added that three rookie mushers who
stayed with Madden while Austin was fetching help probably ruined
their chances for the Rookie of the Year award.
   Madden, a carpenter, moved to Alaska from Billings, Mont., in
1983 and began mushing the following year. He was running in the
Iditarod for the first time.
   Veteran musher Martin Buser led the Anchorage-to-Nome race on its
eighth day. Buser, 30, left Grayling at 3:34 a.m., about four hours
ahead of Susan Butcher and Rick Swenson. Grayline is 497 miles from
the finish line in Nome.
   Butcher has won the last three races and Swenson is a four-time
champion. Buser, who runs a kennel in Big Lake, has never won the
Iditarod but finished third in last year's race.
   With Madden apparently out of the race, the field of contenders
fell to 41, the lowest figure since 1985. Forty-nine mushers were in
the lineup when the race began March 4.
   Mushers are vying for a $250,000 purse, including $50,000 for the
winner.

<HEAD>Man Escapes From U.S. Penitentiary; First In 12 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted bank robber used a disguise
to walk out the front door of the U.S. Penitentiary, the first
prisoner in 12 years to escape from the maximum security prison.
   Robert Allen Litchfield, 40, who was serving 140 years for armed
robbery and a previous escape, was reported missing after the 4 p.m.
count Friday at the maximum security prison.
   Kent Pekarek of the U.S. Marshal's office would not say how
Litchfield was dressed, and officials at the prison refused to say
how the prisoner was allowed to walk out.
   Pekarek said Litchfield had arranged to have a taxi waiting at
the prison and was driven to a bank in Leavenworth. He went into the
bank and brought out a package.
   He then told the taxi driver that he was a safety inspector from
Washington, D.C., and needed to have the package delivered to Kansas
City International Airport.
   The cab driver took the package to the airport as instructed, but
found no one waiting to pick it up. ``That was just to throw us off,
to make us think he went to the airport,'' Pekarek said.
   Litchfield walked to a grocery store and dropped off his disguise
in a dumpster, Pekarek said. He then walked to a restaurant and met
an accomplice, who gave him $5,000 in $100 bills.
   Pekarek said officials know the identity of the accomplice, but
didn't say how they knew the precise amount of the currency.
   After getting the money, Pekarek said, Litchfield flagged down
another cab and asked the driver to take him to a place near Bonner
Springs, about 20 miles south of Leavenworth, where he said his
wife's car had broken down.
   During that ride, Litchfield reportedly changed his instructions
and told the driver to take him to an appliance store at the Indian
Springs Shopping Center in Kansas City, Kan.
   The driver dropped him off at the store at 4:30 p.m., and
authorities are picking up the trail at that point, Pekarek said.
   ``We have additional sources and are receiving more information
about his activities, which we expect to lead to his arrest,'' the
marshal said.
   Litchfield used a similar method to escape from the Federal
Correctional Institution in Talladega, Ala., two years ago, Pekarek
said.
   Dan McCauley, a prison spokesman, said Litchfield was serving
time for bank robbery and use of a firearm in Florida and Georgia,
and for prison escape. His last known address before being sent to
prison was Boca Raton, Fla.
   Pekarek said Litchfield is considered armed and dangerous.

<HEAD>Rebel Followers Say UNITA Chief Tortured And Killed Opponents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former followers of Angolan rebel chief
Jonas Savimbi on Saturday alleged the chief ordered the torture and
killing of dissidents in his ranks, but a Savimbi spokesman denied
the allegations.
   Alcides Sakala, a spokesman in Lisbon for the U.S.- and South
African-backed rebel group UNITA, contended the Soviet-supported
Angolan government is waging a campaign to discredit the rebels.
   Sakala also denied a report in The New York Times that Tito
Chingunji, UNITA's former Washington representative, was being held
against his will in the rebels' southern stronghold of Jamba in the
former Portuguese colony.
   He said Chingunji remained the second-ranking official in UNITA,
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   In London, Independent Television News' ``The World This Week''
broadcast on Saturday an interview with a young man indentified as
Chingunji's nephew, Dinho Chingunji, a UNITA-funded student in
London who had asked for asylum in Britain.
   ``I believe Savimbi killed six members of my family including my
father and grandparents, has also been responsible for the killing
of several UNITA prominent members and also been responsible for the
burning and killing of young children,'' Chingunji said.
   He spelled out the separate cases which he said occurred over a
period of 20 years. He said he had been told by relatives recently
that Savimbi was behind the killings.
   Sousa Jamba, described as a young UNITA writer in London and the
brother of Savimbi's education secretary, said Savimbi was
eliminating any rivals to his leadership.
   ``He feels he's destined to rule Angola,'' said Jamba.
   He reported a 1983 incident that he said was witnessed by his
family, in which Jamba residents were gathered around a bonfire and
a family was doused with gasoline and burned for witchcraft.
   He said one woman tried to escape and Savimbi drew his pistol and
tried to shoot her.
   The New York Times, in a report from London Saturday, quoted
former UNITA supporters as saying Savimbi ordered the torture and
killing of rebel dissidents.
   The Times said witnesses told the human rights organization
Amnesty International that Savimbi had opponents accused of being
witches and then burned in bonfires at public rallies.
   Sakala said the accusation was false and contended three Angolan
students who told the newspaper of the killings ran a front
organization for the Angolan government, aimed to spread reports of
splits within the rebel group.
   UNITA has been fighting the Marxist-oriented Angolan government
since shortly after the country's independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The rebels reject the U.S.-brokered peace accords signed in New
York in December between Angola, South Africa and Cuba, and have
vowed to continue fighting until the government of Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos agrees to negotiate with them.
   Some 50,000 Cuban troops supporting the Angolan government have
begun to leave Angola as part of the agreement.

<HEAD>Former High Commissioner to Germany and Assistant Secretary of War
Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John Jay McCloy, a presidential adviser
and former head of the World Bank who as U.S. high commissioner to
post-World War II Germany helped its transition to civilian control,
died Saturday. He was 93.
   McCloy also served as an assistant secretary of war during World
War II and was chairman of Chase National Bank.
   He died at his home in Stamford, his private secretary, Terry
Recca, said.
   President Bush, in a statement from Camp David, Md., said, ``We
are saddened by the death of John J. McCloy, one of our country's
most outstanding citizens.
   ``Barbara and I send our most sincere condolences to his family.
John McCloy set high standards for public service. His decency and
his sense of honor will long remind us of the very best in our
tradition of service to country.''
   McCloy left a law practice in 1940 to assist fellow Republican
Henry L. Stimson, then the secretary of war. Shortly afterward, he
was appointed assistant secretary of war, for which he eventually
won the Distinguished Service Medal.
   McCloy went to the Casablanca, Cairo and Potsdam conferences of
the Allied war leaders as a consultant.
   As one of the few who knew of the U.S. plan to drop an atomic
bomb on Japan, McCloy suggested the Japanese be warned first and
given a chance to surrender. He was overruled.
   In 1946 and 1947, he was a member of the State Department
Committee on Atomic Energy. From 1947 to 1949, he was president of
the World Bank.
   McCloy capped his public career by going to Germany in 1949 and
serving for three years as U.S. high commissioner.
   His appointment marked the beginning of a changeover from
military to civilian control in the American, British and French
occupation zones. McCloy had resigned as president of the World Bank
to accept the job in Germany.
   ``He knew a great deal about Germany and knew it was essential
that Germany come back into the democratic community of nations, ''
said Shepard Stone, who was McCloy's director of public affairs
while he was high commissioner.
   ``He felt that there were sufficient number of Germans who had
not been Hitlerites or Nazis and that it was essential to help them
in the rebuilding of their country,'' added Stone, who is honorary
chairman of the McCloy Scholar Program at the John F. Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard University.
   McCloy, born March 31, 1895, in Philadelphia, graduated from
Amherst College in Massachusetts and then entered Harvard Law
School, where his studies were interrupted by World War I.
   As a second lieutenant, he went with the 77th Field Artillery to
France. After the war he served with the Army of Occupation in
Germany. Then he re-entered Harvard Law School and obtained a degree
in 1921.
   In 1930, he married Ellen Zinsser. She died in April 1986.
   In 1953, after his service in Germany, McCloy left government to
become chairman of Chase National Bank. Before his retirement in
December 1960, he led Chase into a merger with the Bank of Manhattan
Co. and the bank became the second largest in the nation.
   McCloy later was an unofficial disarmament adviser to President
Eisenhower, and was tapped by President Kennedy to be his official
adviser on disarmament and negotiations. He later served as a
special consultant to U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson.
   In April 1985, President Reagan honored McCloy in a Rose Garden
ceremony, hailing him as a visionary. At that ceremony, two German
officials _ President Richard von Weizsacker and Berlin Mayor
Eberhard Diepgen _ declared McCloy an honorary citizen of West
Berlin.
   He is survived by two children, John Jay McCloy II and Ellen Z.
McCloy, and two grandchildren.

   A twin-engine plane crashed in a field just
north of the Manassas Airport shortly after takeoff Saturday,
killing all five people aboard, state police said.
   ``Somebody heard like a backfire in the engine, and that's all we
know. After that, the plane lost altitude and it crashed,'' police
Sgt. R.S. Keevill said.
   The plane, a 1973 Beechcraft, had left Claymont, Del., earlier in
the day to be shown to prospective buyers in Manassas, Keevill said.
The plane was refueled at Manassas Airport and had just taken off at
2:25 p.m. when it crashed in a field between the airport and the
city of Manassas.
   A state trooper and several people at the airport saw the crash,
Keevill said.
   ``I think it was pretty much intact until it hit. All we know
right now is when it hit the ground, it exploded,'' he said.
``Everything's pretty much close together.''
   The names of the victims were withheld until their families were
notified. According to Keevill, three were from Somerset, Pa., one
was from Toughkenamon, also in southeast Pennsylvania, and one was
from Delaware.
   State police, the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the crash,
Keevill said.

   Work crews using snowmobiles and snowplows
recovered bodies from a woods and looked for clues Saturday to the
cause of an Air Ontario jet crash in central Canada that killed 24
people.
   Officials on Saturday found the voice and flight data recorders,
or black boxes. While they were badly burned in Friday's crash, they
could still be used, said Chief inspector Joe Jackson of the
Canadian Aviation Safety Board.
   At the crash site, dozens of investigators tagged blackened
bodies and body parts as they waded through thigh-deep snow to
photograph and probe the wreckage of the Fokker F-28 jet. Both
pilots were among the dead.
   Jackson refused to speculate on the cause of the crash that
occurred shortly after takeoff from Dryden's airport.
   Provincial police said two of the 47 survivors died later in
hospitals. At least eight of the injured were in serious condition,
said provincial police Constable Bill Brayshaw.
   A temporary morgue was set up in a local sports arena in Dryden,
a paper-mill town of 6,500 people about 200 miles northwest of
Duluth, Minn. A police statement said bodies were to be flown Monday
to Toronto for identification.
   Police said 10 bodies were recovered, but their removal from the
crash site was hampered by freezing weather, deep snow and uneven
bushy terrain.
   Purses, one red high heel shoe and a wheel of the aircraft were
among the debris spread through the trees and on the ground near the
wreckage of the airplane. A woman's gray and pink sweater clung to a
birch tree that had been cut in two during the crash.
   The Dutch-built Fokker-28 was headed for Winnipeg, Manitoba, with
65 passengers and a crew of four when it clipped treetops, plowed
into the woods and burst into flames just after taking off in a
snowstorm.
   Some survivors walked out of the woods on their own, many without
coats or shoes in the deep snow.
   ``All we saw was snow and fire and pieces of metal flying,''
passenger Danny Godin told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. He said
the plane broke apart and, ``Most people were yelling, screaming and
just scrambling.''
   Godin said the plane ``was loaded very heavy. ... We were delayed
in Thunder Bay an hour and we had to take fuel off the airplane
because we were above the legal load limit.''
   ``It was like struggling _ you could hear the (plane)
shuddering,'' said passenger Paul Tagger, 43, of Appleton, Wis., who
escaped with bruises.
   A stewardess, he said, shouted: ``Oh my God, we're going to
crash. Get down! Keep your heads down!''
   Airline vice president Paul McKnight denied the plane was
overloaded.
   The crew members killed included Capt. George Morwood, 52, of
London, Ontario; co-pilot Keith Mills, 35, of Thunder Bay; and
flight attendant Katharine Say, 31, of London. Flight attendant
Sonia Hartwick, 26, of Toronto was not injured.
   Morwood, a 25-year veteran pilot, had been with Air Ontario for
16 years and Mills had been with the airline for 10 years.
   Flight 363 originated in Thunder Bay, an Ontario city on the
north shore of Lake Superior. It made a brief, scheduled stop in
Dryden to pick up passengers and took off about 1 p.m. Friday.
   Norm Pascoe, a spokesman for the Canadian Aviation Safety Board,
said visibility was about half a mile when the plane took off.
   Dryden resident Roxanne Groves heard the aircraft fly overhead.
   ``It didn't sound normal and then all of a sudden we heard a
thump, a good thump. I looked out about five minutes later and there
was black smoke all over the place,'' she said.
   Air Ontario is based in London, Ontario, and is among a number of
rapidly growing commuter airlines providing service to Canada's
scattered towns and cities.
   The last fatal crash in Canada of a regularly scheduled
commercial flight was in 1979, when a Quebecair Fairchild 27 went
down in Quebec City, killing 17 people.
   Canada's worst air disaster occurred in 1985, when 256 people,
mainly American servicemen returning to Kentucky from the Middle
East, died in the crash of a chartered DC-8 in Gander, Newfoundland.

<HEAD>Iranian Community in San Diego Fears Blame For Bombing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Vincennes-Bomb</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Members of San Diego's small Iranian community
say they fear that a suspected terrorist bombing here may add to the
burden of blame they already carry for their roots in the troubled
Middle East.
   A fiery explosion Friday destroyed a van driven by the wife of
Capt. Will Rogers III, who directed the July 1988 missile attack
that mistakenly downed an Iranian airplane in the Persian Gulf.
   The van bombing, which left Sharon Rogers uninjured, has stirred
speculation that the attack was to avenge the deaths of the 290
people aboard the civilian jetliner.
   ``People blame us for everything the ayatollah (Khomeini of Iran)
does, from book-burnings to hijackings,'' said Sara Ahamadianfard,
who came to the United States in 1975 with her husband, a student at
United States International University here.
   ``So it won't surprise me if people assume Iranians had something
to do with this,'' she said.
   Mrs. Rogers received a threatening call after the jetliner's
destruction, Navy Cmdr. David Dillon said. No one has claimed
responsibility for the attack, which is under investigation by
federal authorities.
   Adeeb Nozar Ahmadi, who works at a San Diego grocery store, said
he worries that someone angered by the van bombing might take out
their frustration on him or his young son.
   ``I can tell when some people come into the store that they don't
think I deserve to be here, that I am somehow a terrorist because of
the actions of people I don't even know,'' he said. ``I wonder a lot
what they would do if they got mad enough, if I could become their
victim.''
   Several immigrants in the local Iranian community, estimated at
5,000 in the early 1980s, said they don't necessarily condone
Khomeini's actions, such as the death sentence issued to author
Salman Rushdie for his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``It's like blaming all Germans for the Holocaust,'' said Akbar
Khasravi, an English tutor of Iranian immigrants.
   Khasravi said he abhors any act of violence directed against
innocent people, including Iranians.
   ``Please remember that the people on the jetliner shot down by
the American Navy were innocent, too, just as the woman in the van
was innocent.''

<HEAD>Venturian To Plead Guilty In International Bribery Case</HEAD>

   A company that markets weapons systems to
the U.S. government and more than 60 other countries has agreed to
plead guilty to bribing foreign officials and will pay $1 million in
penalties.
   No charges have been filed in the case, but officials of The
Venturian Corp. said Friday that the company's lawyers had made a
plea agreement with federal prosecutors after a 1{-year grand jury
investigation.
   The grand jury continues to investigate and could indict
officials at the company, which markets a wide range of weapons
systems including armed patrol boats and accessories for the M16
family of military rifles.
   In a public statement released Friday, Venturian said its plea
agreement could bar the company from receiving defense contracts and
strip it of export privileges.
   Venturian's president Gary Rappaport said in a news release, that
if the government does limit the company's operations, he doesn't
believe the restrictions would be in place for a long time.
   A ban on defense contracts and exporting could wipe out as much
as 95 percent of Venturian's annual sales, the company statement
said.
   Rappaport said the company agreed to plead guilty to ``put the
matter behind us. The acts which were the subject of the
investigation were isolated instances, and the person allegedly
involved is no longer with the company.''
   In addition to the bribery charges, the company has agreed to
plead guilty to assisting the preparation and filing of false tax
returns and conspiring to violate various federal antifraud laws and
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   The government will require Venturian to pay restitution,
penalties and fines totaling $1 million. The guilty pleas are
expected to be lodged late next month.
   Venturian, through its subsidiary, Napco International Inc.,
sells spare military parts and other equipment to the governments.
It had sales of about $33 million and profits of about $900,000 in
1987.
   Through the first nine months of 1988 Venturian reported losses
of $125,000 on revenues of $23.1 million. Rappaport told Venturian's
115 employees that the company has an investment portfolio worth
about $5 million and no debt.
   The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime for U.S.
companies to bribe foreign officials, and holds the corporations
accountable even when foreign employees violate company policy by
making the bribes.

   Left-wing guerrillas fired a grenade early
Saturday at an armored police vehicle guarding the headquarters of
the governing Aprista Party and a bystander was wounded, police
reported.
   Friday night, in a nationally televised address, Prime Minister
Armando Villanueva appealed for greater public support of the fight
against Peru's guerrilla groups.
   He said at least 14,000 people have been killed in
guerrilla-related violence since the Maoist Shining Path movement
began its campaign in May 1980 to gain power.
   Police blamed the attack Saturday on guerrillas of the pro-Cuba
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, which is smaller and less active
than the Shining Path and took up arms in 1984.
   Police said the grenade fired from a station wagon fell short of
the armored car, injured a bystander and shattered windows in
buildings.
   Villanueva called on Peruvians to join in a campaign against
terrorism and said the government was authorizing security forces to
commandeer vehicles of state ministries to use against the
guerrillas.
   ``The resources of the state and the government will be mobilized
to give priority to the anti-insurgency struggle,'' he said.

   President Augusto Pinochet said Saturday
he is willing to consider some constitutional changes sought by the
opposition. Critics suggested he was maneuvering to be allowed to
run in the December elections.
   Small groups of anti-government demonstrators battled with
Pinochet supporters in the downtown streets after the president's
speech at a government office building. Police used water cannons to
stop the fighting and there were no immediate reports of arrests or
serious injuries.
   Pinochet is the army commander who led the coup that ousted the
government of Marxist President Salvador Allende in Sepember 1973
and he has headed the military government since then.
   A constitution drafted by his government was enacted in 1981,
barring a president from succeeding himself. Several opponents said
Pinochet might consider some constitutional reforms in exchange for
an amendment that would permit him to be a presidential candidate in
this year's balloting.
   Pinochet said in his speech that ``the only intention the
government has in indicating its willingness to modify the
constitution is to perfect it.
   ``Our aim is far from the intentions of those who want to
dismantle our institutional structure or those who think that the
president who leads the country is acting with some hidden personal
aim,'' he added.
   After the speech he told a cheering crowd outside the building
that they should unite behind a candidate who would continue his
policies.
   Pinochet lost a referendum in October on a proposal to extend his
rule to 1997. The loss, by a vote of 3.9 million to 3.1 million,
obliged him to call open elections scheduled for Dec. 14. He is to
hand over power to the new government on March 11, 1990.
   Pinochet said in the speech that he had instructed Interior
Minister Carlos Caceres to study several constitutional changes
proposed by opposition groups.
   He said he found ``worthy of study'' suggestions that would
modify an article banning Marxism, shorten the planned eight-year
presidential term and eliminate the president's emergency power to
send citizens into exile.
   Opponents said the changes are needed to ensure democracy when an
elected government takes office. The amendments would have to be
approved in a national referendum.
   Pinochet said he also would consider changes to shorten the
presidential term and erase the president's power to dissolve the
House of Deputies and exile opponents.
   Some opposition groups oppose the constitution's provision for a
presidential term of eight years. Before the 1973 coup the president
served for six years.

<TEXT>
   A judge, responding to an artist's appeal, has
ordered workers to stop dismantling a government-commissioned
sculpture once described as a potential ``terrorist device'' by a
security specialist.
   The artist, Richard Serra, filed legal action Friday when workers
with jackhammers began digging up the cobblestones around the
sculpture ``Tilted Arc'' in a lower Manhattan plaza on government
orders.
   ``This government is savage. It is eating its culture,'' Serra
said Saturday, a day after he asked Judge Robert P. Patterson of the
U.S. District Court in Manhattan for a last-ditch action.
   At 8 p.m. Friday, Patterson issued a temporary restraining order
valid until Thursday.
   Serra's lawyer, Jay Topkis, argued Serra's work falls under the
Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
which the United States joined March 1.
   The 112-foot-long, 12-foot-high rusting metal curve _ for which,
Serra said, the Carter administration paid $175,000 _ was installed
in front of a government office building at 26 Federal Plaza in 1981.
   The metal arc soon became the object of complaints.
   ``The removal of the sculpture will result in the community
receiving more open space,'' said William J. Diamond, the regional
administrator of the General Services Administration in charge of
the plaza.
   Removing the sculpture to a motor-vehicle compound in Brooklyn,
would ``allow for more benches and chairs and a more livable
environment,'' he said in Saturday's New York Times.
   Serra warned if his sculpture is removed, every artistic and
literary work commissioned by the government was in jeopardy of
censorship.
   ``It's a death blow, it's thoughtless and barbaric,'' said Serra.
``The U.S. government has never before destroyed a work of art it
has commissioned.''
   He blamed Diamond for the decision, saying the administrator was
responsible for a March 1985 public hearing in New York that
recommended the removal of ``Tilted Arc.''
   ``Diamond convened a hearing at which he was both the prosecutor
and the judge,'' Serra said. ``Diamond found the piece distasteful,
but that's no reason to destroy it.''
   GSA officials reached by telephone said Diamond would not be
available on Saturday to respond to Serra's charges.
   At the hearing, Serra said, ``a government security agent said
that `Tilted Arc' was a terrorist device, comparing it to those used
by bomb experts.''
   According to a transcript of the hearing which Serra quoted,
Vickie O'Dougherty, a security specialist for the GSA, testified
that ``the front curvature of the (sculpture's) design is comparable
to devices which are used by bomb experts to vent explosive forces.
For instance, they have bomb trucks designed for this purpose which
are cylindrical in shape and ... angled comparable to that (of
`Tilted Arc').
   ``This (device) vents an explosion both upward and in an angle
toward both buildings,'' including a nearby FBI building and pistol
range, Serra quoted her as saying.
   At the request of the GSA, a National Endowment for the Arts
panel convened in December 1987 in New York and recommended the work
not be removed, Serra said, but ``the GSA decided to ignore the
record of hearing.''
   After the hearings, Serra filed suit, arguing that moving the
work would ruin it because it was site-specific, ``a cylinder that
is impaled into the ground.'' He also charged the government was
violating his First Amendment rights.
   A federal judge in August 1987 dismissed the suit, saying the
sculpture was an expression of free speech as protected by the First
Amendment, but that the government had the right to do what it
wished with its property.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's action
in May.
   Serra called controversy around his sculpture ``a test case of
moral rights for all artists, so that the government can't at whim
destroy art works.''
   The ``moral rights'' clause of the Berne Convention gives an
artist the right, even after sale of a work, ``to object to any
distortion, mutilation or other modification'' that ``shall be
prejudicial to his honor and reputation.''

   Capt. Will Rogers and his wife Sharon had
settled into a quiet lifestyle where the mistaken destruction of an
Iranian airliner was rarely discuess, friends said. But with the
bombing of Mrs. Roger's van, all that changed.
   The couple's home and neighboring houses and cars immediately
were searched following Friday's bombing which destroyed Mrs.
Roger's Toyota van, as federal investigators sought clues to
determine if terrorism had been behind the blast. Mrs. Rogers
escaped unharmed.
   The FBI said the couple was under guard and in seclusion
Saturday. Protection was offered to their son, who attends college
in upstate New York.
   Whether or not the bombing was the act of terrorists seeking
revenge for Iranian deaths, the event had come home just as
neighbors and friends had feared.
   ``We watched her every single day,'' said Mary Petrou, who lives
across the street from the Roger's home in suburban University City.
   Mrs. Petrou said she set her son's alarm clock so that he would
wake up in time to see Mrs. Roger's leave for work and make sure she
was OK.
   They and other neighbors knew the threats of revenge that
followed the mistaken shooting in July of the airliner by the USS
Vincennes, commanded by Rogers in the Persian Gulf. All 290 people
aboard the plane died.
   Capt. Rogers returned home in October and told reporters he
regretted the loss of lives, but added, ``My absolute responsibility
was for the safety of my ship and crew.''
   Even close friends said the couple hadn't spoken about the
incident since.
   Neighbor George Petrou, who called the Rogers ``good people,''
said they ``never talk shop.''
   ``We talked for happiness, not for business,'' Petrou said. ``But
he is a tough guy, a good soldier.''
   Petrou said he gave the couple some strawberries just before they
left for work. ``When they left, about 7:30, they were laughing and
smiling, and they drove down the street together.''

   A school bus driver who unknowingly left a
mentally impaired 9-year-old boy overnight on her bus in freezing
weather has been fired, school officials said.
   Belinda Rounds, 27, was fired Friday and was not available for
comment.
   The child, whose family has asked that he not be identified, was
found early Thursday by another driver and was taken to a hospital
where he was treated and discharged.
   The boy's parents didn't miss him Wednesday night because they
thought he was staying at a city-run center overnight. Center
officials thought he was at home because he had been absent due to
illness Monday and Tuesday.
   The boy suffers from autism or some other type of disorder that
prevents him from communicating. School officials and the boy's
parents have declined to specify the disorder.
   School officials continued to investigate whether the special
education personnel who work with the boy failed to follow proper
procedures and should be charged with misconduct.

<TEXT>
   Communist rebels on Saturday claimed
responsibility for the killing of a prominent supporter of U.S.
military bases, and the military said nearly 160 Moslem insurgents
surrendered.
   The communist New Peoples Army said in a statement that its
guerrillas shot businessman Remigio Nepomuceno, 43, in Angeles City
last Wednesday because he committed ``crimes against the people,''
including murder and rape.
   Nepomuceno's family owns an electric company and a school and is
involved in real estate and financing in Angeles City, home of the
U.S. Clark Air Base 50 miles north of Manila.
   Police believed Nepomuceno was slain because he helped organize
several rallies in support of the bases. The rallies coincided with
leftist demonstrations urging the government to close the U.S.
facilities.
   The rebels said Nepomuceno's support for the bases was not the
motive for the killing.
   ``We in the NPA respect the political beliefs of other people
even though these are opposed to our position,'' the statement said.
   They accused Nepomuceno of killing a student activist, forcing
women into prostitution, raping three women and serving as a channel
for funds to anti-Communist vigilante groups.
   There was no comment from the victim's family or police on the
allegations. Nepomuceno comes from one of the most prominent
political families in the Angeles area and no criminal charges were
pending against him.
   Also Saturday, the military said 159 Moro National Liberation
Front guerrillas and supporters surrendered Saturday on the southern
island of Tawi-Tawi, 650 miles south of Manila.
   Air Force chief Maj. Gen. Jose de Leon, who accepted the
surrender, promised government assistance to the rebels to
reintegrate themselves into national life. The rebels turned over
about 50 weapons.
   Two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos accepted the
surrender of nearly 900 Front guerrillas and supporters on Jolo
island, which is near Tawi-Tawi.
   Both islands are strongholds of the Moro National Liberation
Front, largest of three Islamic groups which have been waging a
nearly 20-year insurgency for self-rule in Moslem areas of the
southern Philippines.
   President Corazon Aquino promised autonomy to Moslem areas when
she took power three years ago after the overthrow of Ferdinand
Marcos. But few steps have been taken and a bill to establish an
``autonomous region'' in the south has been stalled in Congress.
   In the past, both Communist and Moslem rebel groups have accused
the military of faking surrender ceremonies for propaganda purposes,
rounding up civilians to take oaths of allegiance before television
cameras.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of miles from the Middle East conflict,
a group of Palestinians and Israelis sat down together Saturday to
begin discussions on common goals for peace.
   Officials from the PLO, liberal members of Israel's parliament
and a leading representative from the occupied territories joined
with Arab- and Jewish-American leaders for the symposium at Columbia
University.
   The symposium, sponsored by the Israeli journal New Outlook and
the Palestinian weekly Al Fajr, along with U.S. groups, was based on
principles including the mutual right to self-determination,
renunciation of violence and support for an international peace
conference to include both the Israeli government and the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   There was also to be discussion on resolving conflicts, such as
the 15-month uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that has
claimed the lives of almost 400 Palestinians and 17 Israelis.
   While there would be much discussion, there would be no
unexpected announcements or concessions, said Nabil Shaath, chairman
of the Political Committee of the Palestine National Council, the
legislative arm of the PLO.
   ``There is a lot to do before we are asked again for new
concessions,'' Shaath said Saturday before the meetings began.
   The major concession _ the PLO's recognition of the state of
Israel's right to exist _ has already been made, he said.
   Yossi Sarid, a Knesset member in the left-wing Citizens Rights
Movement, said that regardless of the outcome ``the success is the
very existence of this meeting.''
   Sarid noted polls that show about 55 percent of Israelis support
holding talks with the PLO, yet 90 percent believe the PLO is a
threat to Israel. ``The PLO must search its own soul _ why don't
people believe it?'' he said.
   Also in New York were Knesset members Ran Cohen, Shulamit Aloni
and Yair Tsaban. They have parliamentary immunity from an Israeli
law barring Israeli citizens from meeting with PLO officials.
   Also scheduled to attend was Faisal Husseini, a top PLO supporter
in the occupied lands.
   Three Palestinians, Shaath, Noha Tadross, a member of the PLO's
Foreign Affairs Department in Tunis, and Afif Safieh, PLO
representative to the Netherlands, were granted waivers to a U.S.
law that generally prohibits visas to PLO members.
   Safieh said the New York meeting was a continuation of a series
of gatherings, including one in Paris and one in the Hague.

<HEAD>Report: Baker's Third World Debt Plan May Have Violated Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III may have
violated a Justice Department conflict of interest ruling while he
was treasury secretary in 1987, The Boston Sunday Globe reported.
   The Globe, in Sunday's editions, said Baker rejected a proposal
to force U.S. commercial banks to forgive a large portion of
Brazil's debt while he owned stock in one of the banks.
   The newspaper's report came nearly a month after Baker appeared
to have put the controversy over his holdings in Chemical New York
Corp. behind him. After the issue arose early last month, Baker
quickly moved to silence critics by selling those assets as well as
all other publicly traded stocks that he held in a blind trust.
   Members of Congress noted at the time that Baker had acted on
Third World loan issues while treasury secretary under President
Reagan. Baker was credited with developing the ``Baker plan,'' which
called on Third World nations to make good on their debts.
   According to the Globe, it was at a September 1987 meeting with
Brazil's finance minister that Baker, who at the time owned an
estimated $2 million in Chemical Bank stock, rejected that country's
proposal to restructure some of its $70 billion debt to U.S. banks.
   Chemical Bank has lent $4.5 million to Third World nations,
Brazil among them.
   Three months before Baker took the action, his general counsel
received a Justice Department ruling that high-ranking federal
officials should not take part in any decisions effecting their
personal finances, the Globe said.
   A subsequent study by a economics professor at Stanford
University said Baker's decision had a positive effect on the market
value of the bank's stock. The stock's value rose 40 percent in the
first six months after the decision, from $20 to $28 a share.
   D. Edward Wilson Jr., the Treasury Department's former deputy
general counsel, said that in retrospect, he probably should have
warned Baker about the possible conflict.
   ``If there was a screw-up, it was mine,'' Wilson, now a private
attorney, said Saturday. ``He probably should have been warned there
was a potential problem there.''
   Robert M. Kimmitt, then the Treasury Department's general
counsel, said last week that Baker's participation in the Brazil
decision had been cleared by the department's ethics officer.
   Miklos Lonkay, the ethics officer who cleared Baker's
participation in the Brazil decision, confirmed that he advised
Kimmitt, now Baker's general counsel at the State Department, that
Baker was not required to remove himself from Third World debt
issues generally.
   Like Wilson, however, Lonkay said he did not know the specifics
of the Brazil proposal.
   The Justice Department ruling said the federal
conflict-of-interest law should be interpreted as prohibiting
officials from participating in any ``rulemaking and general policy
matters'' if their decision would have a ``direct and predictable''
effect on their personal holdings.
   C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel, stressed the Justice
Department ruling as his principal argument in persuading a
reluctant Baker to divest himself of his Chemical stock last month,
the Globe said.
   Baker said he was selling the stock to avoid the perception of a
conflict of interest.
   Wilson said he and other lawyers in the Treasury office had
examined the ruling and concluded that it was unlikely Baker could
set a policy or make a single decision that would have a direct
effect on his holdings in Chemical.
   ``I checked every meeting Baker had to make sure that there was
no chance'' a potential conflict-of-interest problem ``might
arise,'' Wilson said. ``On this one, I must have overlooked'' how
much Brazil owed Chemical, he told the newspaper.

<TEXT>
   A Mount McKinley climbing party of three
Japanese men is presumed dead 3,000 feet below the summit of North
America's tallest peak, the National Park Service said Saturday.
   ``I'm afraid I see no hope for the survival of the three men,
knowing what we know right now,'' Ranger Bob Seibert said in calling
off a search by specially-equipped Army helicopters and an
international group of climbers.
   Searchers in a twin-engine airplane Friday flew over part of the
20,320-foot peak and observed three objects, possibly bodies, at the
17,400-foot level, 200 feet above the Japanese party's camp. A
follow-up flight by two CH-47C Army helicopters was organized
Saturday in an unsuccessful attempt to make identification.
   Climb leader Noboru Yamada, 39; Teruo Saegusa, 31; and Kozo
Komatsu, 34, all of Tokyo, set off on their expedition Feb. 16 and
last were seen by an Austrian team descending the mountain as the
Japanese were climbing.
   ``We've had two days of good (mountaineering) weather and we've
seen nobody,'' Seibert said. He said earlier that if the men were
alive and well, they would be moving about.
   Seibert said he no longer could justify the risks the search
posed for the rescue team aboard aircraft hindered by turbulence and
severe downdrafts.
   ``Sometimes we had no aircraft control,'' said Chief Warrant
Officer Myron Babcock, a pilot with 16 years of experience flying
Chinook helicopters.
   In trying to reach the bowl where the reddish-orange objects were
observed, the helicopters Saturday encountered downdrafts that
forced them downward at than 2,000 feet per minute, even with the
aircraft operating at maximum power.
   What were presumed to be the bodies were sighted just below
Denali Pass, an area notorious for its ferocious wind.
   ``It's my guess they were blown right out of the pass,'' Ranger
Roger Robinson said. If that happened, the Japanese would have
fallen 800 vertical feet, Robinson said.
   Searchers had waited most of the week for safe flying weather. On
Friday, a week after the return date the climbers stated when they
set out, winds abated enough for the airplane, but not for the
helicopters.
   Before Friday's flight, Seibert had said he was optimistic the
Japanese were alive. He described the men as well-equipped,
experienced climbers and said it was possible they were waiting out
the weather in snow caves.
   Park Service officials said the climbers also were aware of the
agency's food cache at the mountain's 17,200-foot level.
   ``I wish we could have done more and found more, but sometimes it
doesn't work out,'' Seibert said when he announced the search was
over.

   FBI Director William Sessions said
Saturday that the bombing of a van owned by the wife of the USS
Vincennes commander does not signal the beginning of a new frontier
for international terrorism.
   ``I don't think we're seeing a trend at all,'' he said, referring
to the explosion that destroyed the van of the wife of Navy Capt.
Will Rogers III, who mistakenly ordered the destruction of an
Iranian passenger jet.
   ``We are deeply concerned about that kind of activity _ whether
it is in fact a terrorist act,'' Sessions said at a news conference.
``You just can't tell at this stage.''
   Sessions didn't offer new information on the FBI's investigation
into the explosion Friday that Sharon Rogers escaped unhurt. But
investigators have speculated the bombing was to avenge the 290
people killed in the Vincennes' destruction of an Iranian jetliner
last July.
   Sessions said there is no direct evidence that it was a terrorist
bombing, and he said it may be some time before FBI investigators
are able to determine that.
   ``It is always troubling and, of course, the FBI pays very
careful attention on all those investigations because they are all
very important, because terrorism is a very disturbing and very
divisive and difficult matter to deal with,'' he added.
   Counterterrorism has been a priority with the FBI for the past
six years and will continue to be so, said Sessions, who would not
acknowledge that the nation has become more vulnerable to terrorist
acts.
   ``Both the domestic terrorism investigations and the
international terrorism investigations have had a great deal of
effect on our ability to curtail terroristic acts in the United
States.
   ``At the same time, international terrorism last year suffered
some 875 different incidents, of which about 25 percent involved
American citizens.''
   Sessions, a former U.S. attorney and federal judge, addressed
Drake University Law School students Saturday night.

<HEAD>Report: Bush To Ask Israel And PLO To Ease Tension In Mideast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush Administration, seeking to lay the
foundation for peace talks, plans to ask the Palestine Liberation
Organization and Israel to to reduce tension in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, a newspaper reported.
   In its Sunday editions, The New York Times quoted a senior Bush
administration official who said specific suggestions for Israel
will be presented Monday when Israel's foreign minister, Moshe
Arens, meets with President Bush and members of his staff.
   The administration official told the newspaper that suggestions
for the PLO will be presented to the PLO through the American
ambassador in Tunis, Robert Pelletreau, Jr.
   The suggestions the Bush administration is expected to put
forward to the Israeli government include ending or limiting
administrative detention of Palestinians, reopening schools in the
occupied territories and releasing some Palestinians involved in the
15-month uprising against the Israelis.
   The PLO is expected to be asked to end all violent demonstrations
in the territories, block anti-Israeli raids from southern Lebanon
and stop distributing inflammatory leaflets.
   The newspaper said Bush hopes the suggestions will be the first
steps toward peace talks between Israel and the PLO. However, the
administration official said the Bush proposal does not include a
full-fledged peace plan.
   One senior State Department official said the Bush plan comes
from the conviction that ``peace in the Middle East cannot be made
in America. In the last analysis the parties out there have to make
the tough decisions and all we can do is help them lay the proper
foundations and build the proper frame as they go along.''
   The senior administration official said the president will move
slowly and ``only move when we think there is a reasonable chance of
success.''
   The newspaper also said Israel will be asked to ease some of the
economic restrictions it has imposed on Palestinians from the West
Bank and Gaza who have not paid their taxes since the uprisings
began in December 1987.
   Palestinians who have not paid taxes cannot obtain identity
cards, drivers licenses or travel permits.
   The administration official said it could be difficult for the
PLO to convince Palestinians that concessions on their part would
improve the chances for peace in the area.

<TEXT>
   An overcrowded boat loaded with Haitians
trying to reach the United States capsized off the east coast of
Cuba, leaving 23 dead, the official Cuban news service Prensa Latina
said Saturday.
   There were 166 Haitians aboard the Archaie when it sank off the
coast of Holguin province, according to a Prensa Latina dispatch
monitored in Mexico City.
   The news service blamed bad weather for the accident. It did not
say when the accident occurred and provided few other details.
   Cuban authorities helped rescue the survivors, who were being
given medical attention, clothing and other care, Prensa Latina said.
   The news service said Cuban authorities would investigate the
accident and help identify the victims.
   Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, is on the
island of Hispaniola about 100 miles east of Cuba. Migrants trying
to reach the United States must sail past Cuba's northeast coast to
reach Florida or the Bahamas.
   The Prensa Latina dispatch quoted the Cuban National Information
Agency as saying a similiar accident occurred off the Cuban coast in
the past year, but did not provide any further details.

<HEAD>U.S. Devising Plan to Buy Stingers Back From Afghan Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, fearful that hundreds of
Stinger missiles it sold to Afghan rebels may fall into the hands of
private arms dealers or terrorists, is devising a plan to buy back
the weapons, The New York Times reported.
   The Times in its Sunday editions said, however, that senior
administration believe it may be an impossible task to persuade the
rebels to return even some of the Stingers.
   At an interagency meeting Wednesday at the White House headed by
Robert Graves, the deputy national security adviser, the CIA was
given the task of developing a strategy for the Stinger recovery,
the newspaper reported.
   The United States may try to barter state-of-the-art irrigation
equipment, trucks, tractors and medical facilities as well as sheep
and mules in exchange for the shoulder-held rockets, according to
the Times.
   The Bush administration also is considering trying to shift
covert military aid approved by Congress into funds for
reconstruction and the return of up to five million refugees.
   Some of these funds would then be set aside for Stinger recovery,
the newspaper said.
   ``It's prudent for the administration to try to recover the
Stingers, but I personally doubt it will succeed,'' said Rep.
Charles Wilson, D-Texas, who was instrumental in persuading the
Reagan administration to give the rebels Stingers.
   Frank C. Carlucci, the former secretary of defense, told the
Times, ``We'll never get them back, never.''
   American intelligence officials estimate the rebels have 200 to
500 Stingers, but have no clear idea what rebel groups have the
weapons or where they are stored, the Times said.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, the Arizona Democrat, said, ``We were
assured that the Stingers were turned over to teams of Afghan
mujahedeen who were identifiable so we could monitor them and get
them back, but I'm fearful that may not be the case.''
   The Stinger is the Army's most advanced infantry anti-aircraft
missile; it is often referred to as the perfect terrorist weapon.
   Since mid-1986, when the first Stingers were delivered to the
rebels, some of them have fallen into the hands of Soviet commandoes
and Iranian revolutionary guards.
   Bush administration officials told the newspaper the United
States will urge Pakistan, which has been responsible for funneling
American military aid to the rebel groups, to help in the Stinger
recovery efforts.

<HEAD>With AM-Vatican-US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the address given
Friday to U.S. bishops by Cardinal Eduard Gagnon, the president of
the Pontifical Council for the Family:
   INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY
   The authentic teaching of the Church has usually to go against
what is commonly promoted in the secularist schools and mass media
(and) is often misunderstood or misrepresented inside the Church
itself.
   It is indeed cumbersome and irritating at times to hear families
complain about what is being taught to their children, ... but
listening to them might be the only way we have to know what is
happening at the grass roots of our Catholic communities and
institutions.
   What happens in your country always has an influence, especially
in the developing countries, but also in Europe.
   ABORTION
   Our Council has witnessed with great interest the progress which
the courageous work of laity and clergy since the Roe vs. Wade
decision has realized in forming consciences and changing
mentalities.
   The American Church has not yet obtained everything it would
desire, but it has demonstrated that even adverse public events can
become a providential occasion for that essential part of
evangelization which is to defend the most fundamental right of the
human person.
   You have made many to understand what is expressed in the Charter
of the Rights of the Family: `Economic aid for the advancement of
peoples must not be conditioned on acceptance of programs of
contraception, sterilization or abortion.'
   The bishops in charge of the family apostate for bishops
conferences in more than 50 countries ... have begged their brother
bishops of politically powerful nations to protect them from the new
form of colonialism which anti-life programs constitute. They are
sure you can do something to defend them.
   PORNOGRAPHY
   I know you are trying to work with all people of good will in
defending youth and adults alike against the danger to their
personhood coming from pornography and the potent industries behind
it.
   I would suggest that we do something too about another and more
subtle pornography, that is the degrading of moral values vehicled
by cinema and TV shows which pretend to depict normal American life.
At a U.N. meeting, a sociologist defined the developed and
underdeveloped nations as those who looked at or could not look at
the Dallas TV series.
   We feel our fellow citizens are adult enough to resist such
poisonous food. But the pastors of other worlds would like us to
reflect on what we export can do to the conscience of their people.
   NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING
   A problem has emerged about which we have to be vigilant. That of
combining Natural Family Planning with methods of artificial
contraception, at times because International Planned Parenthood
Foundation or similar groups try to infiltrate Catholic
associations, and corrupt and pirate N.F.P. methods.
   MARRIAGE INDISSOLUBILITY AND TRIBUNALS
   The prevalent divorce mentality has rendered the role of marriage
tribunals most essential and at the same time most complex.
   We know you are worried about the problems you are confronted
with because of the lack of personnel for the tribunals and the huge
number of broken marriages.
   Women religious can be very helpful in dealing with marriage
cases, but we have to be careful that their tender hearts do not
play tricks on them.
   MARRIAGE PREPARATION AND DOCTRINE
   I think we should not be pessimistic about the possibility of
reversing trends and changing the climate of hostility which has
been prevalent against the Magisterium's doctrine on conjugal
morality.
   The number of good young couples who look for sound spiritual
guidance is much greater than we would think.
   A new challenge is offered to the Church by the efforts of
Planned Parenthood to set up school-based clinics for abortion
referral and contraception. A way to oppose this menace in all
dioceses would be to develop a united policy and practice on a
national level. Planned Parenthood programs of sex education in no
way resolve the problem of teen-age pregnancies, but rather increase
it by encouraging promiscuity. The statistical fact surprisingly
turned up in one of their own surveys.
   OTHER ISSUES
   Another question is the spreading of euthanasia. ... Word
engineering that leads to idea engineering ... could ultimately lead
to legalization of euthanasia, as it has done for abortion.
   A further question is that of the ministry to remarried
divorcees. Some forms of such ministry, ignoring the principles set
in Familias Consortio, have degenerated into dating services for
divorced Catholics who are not free to marry. I know that their
promoters are personages who cannot easily be brought under
episcopal control. Maybe some guidelines coming from your Conference
could help priests and faithful in their discernment.
   It is evident that ideological feminism has a deleterious
influence on the family. But conversely the best way to counter its
influence will be to care more about the family and make every one
in it more conscious of his or her vocation ``to serve and not be
served,'' as Christ has taught us.
   Much is being said here of feminism. I would just like to remark
that when we work, as we should, for the promotion of women, we
should be careful in choosing the persons we work with.

<TEXT>
   About 100 whales are grounded on a
beach in the Strait of Magellan and some apparently are dead, the
navy reported Friday.
   It said the whales were seen Thursday on a beach of Bahia Lomas
on Tierra del Fuego at the western end of the strait.
   A navy spokeswoman said no other details were available and that
a ship was sent to the area to investigate, but preliminary reports
indicated a number of the mammals were dead.
   It was the second incident of grounded whales in the Strait of
Magellan, at the southern tip of South America, this week.
   On Wednesday 38 whales measuring 9 to 30 feet long were stranded
on a beach at Punta Delgada, also in the western section of the
strait.
   Officials said 26 were able to return to sea with a high tide but
12 perished.
   They said the cause of the mass groundings has not been
determined. Some specialists suggested the unusual warmth of the
normally frigid water might have interefered with the whales' sonar
directional systems.

<HEAD>Commission Ends Session After Votes on Cuba, Romania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Human Rights Commission ended its 1989
session on Friday with votes on Cuba and Romania, rounding out a
list of more than 100 resolutions and decisions in a six-week
meeting.
   Under a measure backed by Romania's Warsaw Pact ally Hungary and
by all Western and some Third World countries, Romania will come
under a U.N. inquiry for alleged grave human rights abuses.
   In coming under scrutiny, it joins such nations as Chile, El
Salvador, South Africa.
   Relations between communist neighbors Romania and Hungary
deteriorated after Hungary publicly accused Romania of depriving its
ethnic Hungarian minority of their ethnic and cultural rights.
Romania denies it.
   A vaguely worded resolution on Cuba, supported by both the Havana
government and the United States, dashed Washington's hopes of a
continued U.N. surveillance of the human rights situation under the
Fidel Castro government.
   A Western proposal that would have added Iraq to the list of
suspected human rights violators failed to come to a vote. Iraq
blocked it by a procedural motion backed by most Third World
countries, which had a majority in the 43-nation panel.
   The commission approved a draft convention on the rights of
children and a draft protocol designed to promote the abolition of
the death penalty. Both drafts go before next fall's U.N. General
Assembly for a final decision.

   Officials sealed off beach areas Friday as
gusting wind and waves battered oceanfront cottages and motels, but
the weather service predicted relief from the storm.
   Officials estimate that the storm has inflicted $4.5 million
damage.
   Kitty Hawk was hardest hit, with $2 million in damages reported
by Friday night, said Dare County civil defense officials. Damage at
Nags Head ran to $1.9 million, Kill Devil Hills had $430,000 and
Hatteras Island $200,000.
   ``That's the breaks,'' Ernie McGlothlin said as he watched the
sea batter the beachfront retirement home he bought two years ago.
``I don't know if the whole house is going to go or just the front
half. But if it goes, it goes. There's nothing I can do about it.''
   His house was one of 70 cottages and motels damaged or destroyed
by the storm that kicked up tides and wind, eroding the slender
beaches of the northern Outer Banks of North Carolina.
   When McGlothlin bought his house, a 15-foot sand dune blocked the
view of the ocean from the first floor. A storm last month wiped out
the dune and the waves have crept closer to his foundation all this
week.
   ``First, it took the porch, and we thought, well, maybe it won't
come any further,'' said Marie Coble of Kitty Hawk, a friend who has
helped McGlothlin renovate the home. ``That's when we moved the
furniture to the back of the house. Then the side wall came down and
collapsed the front bedroom. If it comes any further, it could cause
the rest of that end to collapse.''
   A proclamation by Nags Head Mayor Donald Bryan sealing off the
beach was the first of its kind in nine years. It bars pedestrians
and traffic from the beach road in South Nags Head, except for
property owners. It also forbids anyone to enter damaged buildings
along the beach.
   National Weather Service forecasters said the threat might lessen
after Friday as a storm packing 60 mph winds moves to sea. The storm
has battered the coast for three days, causing damages expected to
be in the millions of dollars.
   ``I got to laugh to keep from crying,'' said Kitty Hawk resident
Joseph Verscharen as he and his wife, Janet, surveyed the damage to
their oceanfront lot on Thursday. ``This was our castle.''
   About 10 feet of their cottage hung over a 6-foot cliff where the
ocean had eroded more than 75 feet of beach and a dune the
Verscharens built after storm damage in April.
   Since the storm began Tuesday, North Carolina Power has
disconnected electric lines to 45 endangered residences, primarily
in South Nags Head and Kitty Hawk.
   The high tides had Hatteras Island officials worried about the
Herbert C. Bonner bridge, the only connection between the island's
5,000 residents and Bodie Island. Late Thursday night, officials
said water was sloshing over both ends of the bridge.
   About 75 feet of the Hatteras Island Fishing Pier in Rodanthe
washed away. In Kill Devil Hills, bulkheading supporting the Avalon
Pier was undercut, prompting officials to rope it off.
   But National Park Service officials said the Cape Hatteras
Lighthouse has been spared by a sandbar offshore.
   In Virginia, officials in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach region said
the storm caused five deaths, including a homeless man who died of
exposure Friday, and had caused $776,000 damage to 45 coastal homes.

wife of the USS Vincennes skipper who mistakenly ordered the downing
of an Iranian airliner.
   Sharon Rogers, 50, the wife of Capt. Will Rogers III, narrowly
escaped injury Friday when she got out of the van after it was
rocked by what sounded like two backfires. Moments later, a pipe
bomb explosion engulfed the vehicle in flames, authorities and

confirmation hearings would begin next week.
   Bush announced the nomination of Cheney, a sixth-term congressman
and the No. 2 Republican leader in the House, on Friday, calling him
a ``widely respected man of principle.'' Dismissing as ``history''
the long battle over Tower that ended in defeat Thursday, Bush
predicted Cheney would win confirmation rapidly.
   Shortly after the White House announcement, leaders of the Senate
Armed Services Committee said confirmation hearings would begin next

   Rescuers hunted for bodies in dense forest
and deep snow after an Air Ontario jet crashed into trees and burst
into flames shortly after taking off in a snowstorm. Police said 23
people died.
   Forty-six people survived the spectacular crash, which occurred
just minutes after the jet left a small airport in western Ontario
on Friday, authorities said. The cause was under investigation.
   The Dutch-built Fokker-28 was bound for Winnipeg with 69 people
aboard when it clipped treetops and exploded into flames at about
1:10 p.m., officials said. The plane cut a swath a half-mile long
and about 100 feet wide near Dryden, a town of 6,500 people about
200 miles northwest of Duluth, Minn.

   The Bush administration has shifted gears and
put forward a new plan to deal with Latin America's debt crisis _
one that envisions major reductions in the billion-dollar debt
burden.
   The proposal, unveiled Friday by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady before an audience of international bankers, members of
Congress and leaders of international lending institutions, is
getting generally positive reviews.
   Brady called for a ``great cooperative effort'' among all nations
to solve the 7-year-old crisis. ``Our objective is to rekindle the
hope of the people and leaders of debtor nations that their
sacrifices will lead to greater prosperity in the present and the
prospect of a future unclouded by the burden of debt,'' Brady said.

   Democratic leaders are learning just how hard
it is to craft a message that will appeal to middle class voters
without alienating the poor and minorities who have become the
party's most reliable base.
   That problem, which has cost three straight presidential
elections, surfaced Friday at a meeting of the Democratic Leadership
Council in which Jesse Jackson sparred with party leaders who view
him as trying to steer them in the wrong direction.
   ``The issue is not just who leads us, but who needs us,'' Jackson

   Forget plastics. The glow is off computers.
Hazardous waste disposal is the high-tech growth industry of the
1990s.
   So say some of the 500 environmental entrepreneurs, executives
and consultants who recently stormed a two-day conference on how to
profit from America's toxic waste problem.
   ``Two or three years ago if you'd said you're having a hazardous
waste business conference, you'd get very few people showing up,''
said Stephen L. Irish, whose company extracts heavy metals from
contaminated wastewater.
   But it was standing room only at a recent session in the Copley
Plaza Hotel's ornate ballroom.
   The subject: ``Identifying Market Opportunities in the Hazardous
Waste Industry,'' or, as one attendee put it, ``Given that companies
don't publicize their hazardous waste problems, how do we identify
potential customers?''
   Other sessions covered how to comply with environmental
regulations, how to minimize legal liability, ``Surviving
Hypergrowth'' and ``Preventing Your Employees from Becoming Your
Archrivals,'' that is, how to protect toxic trade secrets.
   The beverage served everywhere was mineral water.
   Hazardous waste processing will be a $5 billion industry this
year and could hit $12 billion by 1994, said conference organizer
Richard S. Golob, publisher of the weekly newsletter ``Harzardous
Materials Intelligence Report.''
   There is no shortage of stuff to clean up. The Environmental
Protection Agency has identified 30,000 potentially hazardous sites,
of which 1,000 now qualify for Superfund clean-up money. According
to Golob, other surveys have estimated that up to 430,000 U.S.
manufacturing plants may have some kind of contamination.
   And the Department of Energy has estimated the cost of managing,
disposing and cleaning up radioactive and hazardous contamination at
its own facilities could range from $53 billion to $92 billion,
department spokesman Will Callicott said.
   Heavy industry is by no means the only culprit. The manufacturing
of pharmaceuticals, consumer products and even decaffeinated coffee
produces hazardous waste.
   As state and federal environmental regulations get stiffer,
companies that can deal with infectious waste, radioactive
contamination and dirty drinking water are in special demand.
   Stephen Irish's enterprise was born last year from tougher state
and federal groundwater regulations. Electroplating plants produce
rinsewater that includes heavy metals, including nickel, lead and a
cancer-causing chromium compound, said Irish, director of marketing
for UNC Reclamation, a Mulberry, Fla., subsidiary of UNC Inc.
   UNC Reclamation installs equipment that extracts the metals from
rinsewater, Irish said. The residue is turned into metal salts that
can be sold back to the electroplaters, he said.
   The service costs electroplaters less than dumping their metallic
sludge in landfills did. And it eliminates their long-term legal
liability, Irish said. The process also ensures that no contaminants
will leak from a landfill into groundwater.
   ``Clearly it's the intent of Congress to keep anything from going
into the ground,'' Irish said. ``Reclamation is what they want.''
   UNC Reclamation generated a slight profit last year and sales are
expected to hit $12 million this year, he said. The firm plans to
expand into cleaning up toxic sludge from batteries that have been
dumped into some Gainesville, Fla., lagoons.
   The environmental boom has already produced some hazardous waste
millionaires, Golob said. One high-tech entrepreneur is Alan S.
McKim, who founded Clean Harbors Inc. of Boston in 1980 at the age
of 25. The company said it now has nearly 1,000 employees and had
sales of $73 million last year.
   But the industry has to cope with more than its share of
regulation and red tape, said Thomas Moran, vice president of
DartAmerica of Freehold, N.J.
   DartAmerica transports toxic, low-level nuclear and solid waste
to approved disposal sites. It is regulated by the EPA and the
federal Department of Transportation, and has to have a panoply of
permits that allow it to truck waste in 48 states. It takes three
full-time employees just to handle shipping permits, Moran said.
   ``In New York, PCBs are regulated and (waste) oil isn't. In New
Jersey, oil is regulated but PCBs aren't,'' Moran said. ``You're
like a slave to 48 masters.''

   As he fled, wounded, through the jungles of
Cambodia, Sichan Siv never could have imagined that in 13 years he
would be a top aide to an American president.
   For Siv, 41, deputy assistant to President Bush for public
liaison, the term American dream is not a cliche. His almost
unbelievable story is the stuff of movies.
   In a symbolic gesture, Siv opted to start his job Feb. 13, the
13th anniversary of his escape from Cambodia. But he said, with a
smile, the highlight of his 4-week-old tenure at the White House
came when he met Bush last week, and the president ``pronounced my
name right.''
   In his new job, one of two deputies in the office, Siv is Bush's
contact with ethnic and minority groups. He deals with issues like
civil rights, education, the homeless and refugees.
   Siv's tortuous path from wounded refugee to presidential aide
began after the Khmer Rouge, a brutal communist insurgency, defeated
the U.S.-backed government of Lon Nol in April 1975.
   Before his escape, Siv rode a bicycle across Cambodia for 20
days, survived in a Khmer Rouge labor camp eating a bowl of rice a
day and worked myriad jobs from dawn to dusk.
   ``I dug irrigation canals. I plowed land. I planted rice. I
harvested rice,'' he said.
   He fled Cambodia 10 months after the Khmer Rouge takeover by
jumping off a timber truck and running through the jungle without
food for three days until he reached Thailand. En route, he stepped
on a land mine.
   About 15 family members, including his mother, were among the
hundreds of thousands of people killed by the Pol Pot regime.
   It was his mother, a Buddhist, whose philosophy helped him
survive, Siv said.
   ``The two things she told me are, `As long as you live you must
always have hope,' and, `Happiness is something you can't keep
unless you give it away.' Those are the basic values of life that I
have always kept with me,'' he said in an interview.
   Siv's new life, working in an ornate, high-ceilinged office at
the White House complex, seems light years away from the Cambodian
bush.
   But Siv, who dresses in pin-striped suits with suspenders and
speaks English with an accent, keeps mementos nearby: native musical
instruments, silver ornaments and books about his native land.
   The son of a policeman, Siv received his high school and college
education in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital. Before the capital
fell, he worked with the airline, as a high school teacher and as an
administrator with CARE, the relief organization.
   He was supposed to be evacuated from the U.S. Embassy by
helicopter, but missed the last flight out on April 12, 1975 by 30
minutes. It took him until the following February to make his break.
   During that time, Siv was forced to conceal his education from
the Khmer Rouge, who were determined to stamp out the intelligensia.
And his decision to get to the Thai-Cambodian border meant a
traumatic separation from his family.
   Arriving in Thailand, Siv was jailed as an illegal entrant, but
was later released and placed in a refugee camp. There, a Catholic
relief group found a couple in Wallingford, Conn., willing to
sponsor Siv. He arrived in the United States with $2 in his pocket.
   ``He's a person with a great deal of charisma,'' said Bob
Charles, the Wallingford man who brought Siv to this country.
Charles is a housing consultant.
   With nothing to his name, Siv picked apples and worked in an ice
cream parlor before New York City beckoned. There he drove a taxi
cab for six months, and, later got a job with the Lutheran
Immigration and Refugee Service.
   Eager to improve his lot, Siv won a scholarship from Columbia
University where he obtained a master's degree in international
affairs. Degree in hand, Siv worked at the United Nations and for
the Institute for International Education.
   Siv also a Texas connection through his wife, Martha, a United
Nations librarian from Pampa, Texas. ``I'm the honorary mayor of
Pampa,'' Siv said, proudly displaying a key to the city. Married in
1983, the couple has no children.
   In 1987, Siv went to work for Bush as, he says, ``one of the many
faceless volunteers'' in New York. He raised money and made contacts
with the Asian community.
   Once Bush was elected, Chase Untermeyer, a Texan who heads the
White House personnel office, recommended Siv for his present job.
John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and David Demarest, the
communications director, approved the hiring.
   ``I was impressed not only with the substance and drama of his
backround, but also his political acumen, his character and his
obvious knowledge of how to get things done, and a drive and
stick-to-it-iveness that you need in the job he's got,'' Demarest
said.
   Court Robinson, an analyst with the U.S. Committee for Refugees
who knows Siv, said the new White House aide has focused heavily on
Cambodian issues. But refugees like Siv often have a keen interest
in the domestic issues of their adopted country, he said. ``He's
always struck me as bright and articulate,'' Robinson said.
   Siv attributes his rise to his adaptability. ``I have been
fortunate to get myself adjusted into new situations very quickly,''
he said.
   Hard work is another must for the upwardly mobile. Siv said he
has promised himself he won't work more than 13 hours on weekdays
and 10 hours on the weekend.
   ``It doesn't matter how many hours I put in ... there is no
single minute that is boring or dull,'' he said.

<HEAD>A Musical ``Metropolis'' Comes To Life In London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Fritz Lang had known that his 1926 film
``Metropolis'' would become a musical, he might have laughed.
   Perhaps Victor Hugo would have also. After all, if Hugo's epic
19th-century novel ``Les Miserables'' could become a hit musical,
why not Lang's classic vision of the future?
   ``I think `Les Miz' is the best thing ever; that's what I'd like
our show to live up to,'' said Joseph Brooks, who wrote the Grammy
award-winning song ``You Light Up My Life,'' from the 1977 movie of
that name.
   ``Metropolis,'' which opened in London March 8, cost 2.5 million
pounds ($4.38 million), and is the first of several large-scale
musicals to open this year in London.
   Its bow at the Piccadilly Theater follows a bad period for
British musical productions in 1988, when ``Chess'' and ``Carrie''
flopped on Broadway and ``Can-Can,'' ``Budgie'' and ``Ziegfeld''
died in London.
   Brooks has co-written the music, book and lyrics of
``Metropolis.'' Frenchman Jerome Savary, who staged a hit Paris
revival of ``Cabaret'' in 1986, is directing, with choreography by
Tom Jobe, the American who starred in ``Chess'' in London.
   Brian Blessed, the original Old Deuteronomy in ``Cats,'' heads
the cast as John Freeman, the evil master of the machine-age
metropolis where the action takes place. The romantic leads are
played by Graham Bickley and Judy Kuhn, who was nominated for a Tony
for her role in the American production of ``Chess,'' in a show
that, despite its emphasis on technology, aims to put emotion first.
   ``I'm hopeful that the music and the emotional content of what we
want to say are what will be taken home,'' said Brooks.
   Brooks moved to London in 1985 with his wife and two children,
intending to write a musical, and he was searching for strongly
visual material that would transfer well to the stage.
   His wife, Susan, asked the British Film Institute for a list of
its movies, Brooks recalled. When the title ``Metropolis'' appeared,
her reaction was, ``That's the film.'' A series of screenings
ensued, followed by negotiations with the Fritz Lang estate in
Vienna.
   ``Metropolis'' is a stupefying tale about workers in a
modernistic city who live underground. A sweet girl named Maria
soothes their unrest until a mad scientist creates an artificial
evil Maria who leads the workers to revolt. The silent film, a
benchmark of German expressionism, was reissued in 1984 with a
colored tint and a score by Giorgio Moroder.
   The play is Brooks' first writing for the theater. He composed
the music for the films ``Marjoe,'' ``The Garden of the
Finzi-Continis'' and ``The Lords of Flatbush,'' and has written over
140 advertising jingles, mostly for television.
   ``I grew up in Manhattan loving all the old standards:
`Carousel,' `Oklahoma!' They all had tremendous melodies; that's
what I've tried to do.''
   But the initial appeal of ``Metropolis'' may well lie in its
scenery, which takes up one-third of the musical's budget. Its
massive gray-and-black, pipe-filled sets evoke an oppressively cold,
mechanistic environment populated by two worlds _ the underground
one of the two lovers and the elitist one ruled by the evil inventor
(Freeman).
   Brooks and his colleagues dispute suggestions that ``Metropolis''
is another British techno-spectacle such as ``Cats'' and ``Starlight
Express.''
   ``If ever a show required a big visual statement, it's this
one,'' said Ralph Koltai, the Hungarian designer responsible for the
ill-fated ``Carrie'' and a frequent collaborator at the Royal
Shakespeare Company. ``You couldn't do `Metropolis' on an empty
stage with a chair.''
   Judy Kuhn, who makes her West End debut as the saintly Maria,
said: ``This show is about machines; it's about what man has created.
   ``As long as technology helps the show, it's OK. It's technology
for its own sake that's the problem.''

<HEAD>Behind the Seams, Velcro Packs 'Em In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAUDIA COATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If one had to sum up the quick-change artistry of
``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' in one word, that word might be _
Velcro.
   The way Velcro opens and closes at a touch helps make it possible
for two dressers to whiz actor Jason Alexander through a 10-second
costume change. That's all the time it takes for him to turn from an
ancient Roman in ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum''
into a 1912 dandy for ``High Button Shoes.''
   One of the secrets of how Alexander, who has the lead role of The
Setter, can change so fast is that his high-button shoes don't
button. To save time, they're rigged with zippers.
   ``I think the audience loves quick changes. It's like magic to
them,'' said Barbara Matera, owner of Barbara Matera Ltd., the shop
that made the costumes.
   Velcro, a fabric with a surface of clinging pile, is ``a very big
word in our vocabulary,'' said the show's supervising costume
designer, Joseph Aulisi.
   With nearly 400 costumes in the show and with a cast of 45 doing
18 numbers, there are lots of magical quick changes every night. In
fact there are so many of them that sometimes the entire cast is
backstage whipping clothes off and on, he said. Twenty dressers help.
   Because the critically-acclaimed show is a pastiche of old
Broadway musicals that Robbins has either directed or choreographed
or both, there's enough variety to send a costume maker reaching for
a headache powder.
   The musicals are as disparate as ``The King and I,'' set in Siam
in the 1860s, and ``West Side Story,'' set in Manhattan in the '50s.
   Matera recently talked about some of the quick-change tricks
besides Velcro and zippers she and Aulisi employ to help the singers
and dancers assume identities from 11 different times and places.
   One trick is to dress the cast members in layers that peel off to
reveal the costume for the next number. But for dancers, it's not
too comfortable to perform under bright lights as well as layers of
fabric.
   Another ``behind-the-seams'' secret is to line clothes with a
slippery fabric so they slide easily on and off.
   And some belts aren't what they appear to be on stage. They're
not threaded through belt loops, but sewn right onto the pants. ``If
a costume consists of various parts you have to sort of bash them
all together,'' Matera said.
   Barbara Matera Ltd. has about 30 employees most of the time, but
has given work to as many as 100 people at one time when there's a
lot to do.
   While the company was costuming ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' it
also did a full-length version of ``Swan Lake'' for the American
Ballet Theater, and the road company versions of ``Anything Goes''
and ``Into the Woods.''
   Costume work is seasonal and year-round jobs are few. ``The New
York Theatrical Sourcebook'' lists 55 costume craftsmen and 20
costume shops in Manhattan and Brooklyn. However, only four or five
of the shops are highly regarded mainstays, said Carrie Robbins,
master teacher of costuming at New York University and a free-lance
costume designer.
   Most costume shop employees are drapers or a designer's
assistant, tailor or finisher, and do not make much money. If they
land a full-time job, they make about $18,000-$26,000.
   ``They do it because they love theater and love making
costumes,'' said Robbins.
   It's not a soft job, either.
   ``You go to sleep with bloody hands. It's very tiring on your
hands and your arms and your shoulders,'' said Maggie Raywood, the
workroom supervisor at Parsons-Meares Ltd., another of the top
costume shops.
   Parsons-Meares employees should know. They're the ones who made
the costumes for the Broadway musical, ``Starlight Express,'' in
which the train-car costumes starred as much as the cast did.
Parsons-Meares found unusual fabrics and invented new constructions
for the costumes, which looked like metal but moved like leotards.
   The getup for one ``Starlight'' character even incorporated a
strobe light which the actor could flash by bringing together his
forefinger and thumb. The back of the glove was made of rubber to
protect him from shock.
   The designs were worked up from scratch.
   However, in the case of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' the designs
already existed. Aulisi said he recreated the originals as
faithfully as possible. Matera said in some cases they were aided by
the discovery of the designers' old renderings with swatches of
fabric still stapled on.
   However, Aulisi said, ``Jerry was quite concerned that the show
be relevant to the '80s.'' So some stretch fabrics were used to give
an '80s fit and style that emphasized the dancers' bodies.
   One thing that didn't change from the original show was the
beaded silk organza butterfly that decorates the crotch of a
stripper, Tessie, in a number from ``Gypsy.''
   Matera went to some lengths to recreate it, even calling upon the
actress who originated the role on Broadway, Maria Karnilova, for
advice. Matera wanted to make sure it flapped the way it did in the
1959 production. Like Karnilova, the actress now appearing as
Tessie, Faith Prince, makes the butterfly move with a grind of the
hips.
   ``It's weighted in a certain way,'' Matera said. ``It doesn't
exactly flutter. It sort of bumps.''

   If stocks are headed for an extended bear market,
a large group of presumably savvy investors is going to be proved
wrong.
   These people _ top corporate executives, directors and major
shareholders _ have been voting consistently with their checkbooks
lately for higher stock prices in the months and years ahead.
   ``The insider buying of the last 16 months is the strongest
sustained buying trend on record,'' says editor Norman Fosback in
the current issue of The Insiders, a newsletter that tracks the
activities of what it calls ``America's most knowledgeable
investors.''
   The word ``insider'' has been associated with a lot of illegal
tarding activity in recent years.
   What Fosback and a good many other analysts track, however, are
purchases and sales that top corporate officials report to
regulators in compliance with the rules.
   These people tend to be longer-term investors rather than
traders, since the law provides that they can be forced to give up
any profits on shares of their own companies held for less than six
months.
   Since insiders acquire much of their holdings through private
means _ exercise of stock options, for example _ their public
activity naturally involves more selling than buying.
   Fosback figures that the ``normal'' level of purchases is 35
percent of total transactions.
   According to his calculations, insider buying has been above that
norm since early 1987. It soared to an unprecedented high after the
crash in October 1987, and has settled down in the neighborhood of
50 percent over the past year or so.
   ``The Insider Indicator simply shows no letup of insider
buying,'' Fosback said. ``Until the indicator eases down into the
selling zone (below 35 percent), expect most market surprises to be
pleasant ones.''
   Skeptics about the usefulness of this indicator point out that
insiders were enthusiastically buying through the weeks and months
that led up to the crash in the fall of 1987.
   Fosback, who readily acknowledged at the time that the insiders
``completely missed'' the crash, says the experience showed that
this indicator, like all others, can't be considered infallible.
   But the idea of tracking insider transactions gets an
enthusiastic endorsement from Peter Lynch, the celebrated manager of
the Fidelity Magellan Fund, in the recently published book ``One Up
On Wall Street'' he wrote with John Rothchild.
   ``There's no better tipoff to the probable success of a stock
than that people in the company are putting their own money into
it,'' Lynch writes.
   ``When insiders are buying like crazy, you can be certain that,
at a minimum, the company will not go bankrupt in the next six
months.
   ``Long term, there's another important benefit. When management
owns stock, then rewarding the shareholders becomes a first
priority, whereas when management simply collects a paycheck, then
increasing salaries becomes a first priority.
   ``Since bigger companies tend to pay bigger salaries to
executives, there's a natural tendency for corporate wage-earners to
expand the business at any cost, often to the detriment of
shareholders. This happens less often when management is heavily
invested in shares.''
   Lynch does not advocate using insider purchases as an indicator
for quick trading profits. Indeed, he does not advocate seeking
quick trading profits at all, since he does not think it feasible to
try to outguess what the market as a whole is going to do.
   Instead, he advocates concentrating on choosing stocks of
companies that have good business reasons why they might gain
greater popularity in the future on Wall Street.
   Thus, he says, ``if the stock prices drops after the insiders
have bought, so that you have a chance to buy it cheaper than they
did, so much the better for you.''

   Sallie Bingham insists she doesn't want pity.
   But her book, ``Passion and Prejudice: A Family Memoir'' (Knopf,
$22.95), an account of the Binghams of Kentucky and her role in the
breakup of one of the last great newspaper dynasties in the nation,
reads like a 500-page plea for sympathy.
   ``I don't want anybody to feel sorry for me. I would think that
was ridiculous,'' she said in a recent interview. ``I mean I think
that they might feel regret that the Bingham family behaved the way
they have. To feel sorry for me would be ludicrous, because having
this money gives me all kinds of wonderful opportunity that most
people would never have.''
   The money to which Bingham referred is the $62 million she
received when her father, Barry Bingham Sr., announced in 1986 that
he was selling the family holdings _ The Courier-Journal and The
Louisville Times newspapers, a Louisville TV station and a printing
company _ to settle family squabbles over control of the empire.
   The Bingham family is to Kentucky what the Kennedys are to the
rest of the nation. Their great wealth and good works gave them an
almost mythical status in the state. The Courier-Journal, which has
won eight Pulitzer Prizes, was distributed throughout Kentucky and
had national influence. For many years it was ranked among the top
10 newspapers in the country. The family had a liberal reputation, a
strong civil rights record and spent millions and millions on arts,
education and conservation.
   Bingham, 52, whose announcement that she wanted to sell her 15
percent share of the holdings was believed to have been the genesis
of the family dispute, rejected the family's buy-out offers as too
low and held out for an outside offer. ``Passion and Prejudice'' is
her attempt to remove the villain label cast upon her since her
father sold the papers to the Gannett Co. for a reported $435.8
million.
   She said she finds it a little bewildering that the family, with
whom she is now very publicly estranged, holds her responsible for
the dissolution of the empire.
   ``As you know, I was a minority shareholder,'' she said. ``So
it's a little impossible for me to accept responsiblity for the sale
of those companies. That was really father's decision. ... But
people seem to want to seek a scapegoat, which is what I see
happening to women a good deal.'' In her book she said she didn't
know he had decided to sell the papers until a reporter telephoned
her at a restaurant and read her the press statement.
   Her memoir contends that for generations the Bingham men have
muzzled the Bingham women, relegating them to serving tea and
planning cocktail parties while the patriarchs ruled the
communications empire.
   Although many of her claims of male chauvinism might be justified
_ her brother, Barry Bingham Jr., demanded in 1983 that all the
Bingham women resign from the company's board of directors or he
would resign as publisher of the papers _ the feminist rhetoric she
espouses in the book and in her interview sounds less like
impassioned belief than window-dressing to conceal a vendetta
against the rest of the family for myriad grievances.
   Since ``Passion and Prejudice'' was published last month, the
other members of the Bingham family, her brother, mother and sister
(her father died last August), have retorted with an impressive
document mailed out to book reviewers nationwide chronicling what it
claims are some 300 errors in the book.
   Some of the errors the bound and painstakingly appendixed
document cites are petty and sniping, such as one pointing out that
the author's reference to her brother's blond mustache in a
particular passage is incorrect because he didn't grow it until
later.
   Others are more serious. In her book Bingham says her parents
asked her to return to editing the paper's book page, a job she'd
held briefly while the regular editor took a short leave of absence.
She accepted, and the editor was reassigned to another position. The
Bingham document states that it was Sallie Bingham who pressured her
father into transferring the book page editor so she could
permanently have the job.
   In fact, Shirley Williams, the book page editor who lost her job,
has filed a libel suit against Bingham and her publishers claiming
that the ``false, intentional and malicious passage'' has damaged
her professional reputation. Williams is now a reporter for The
Courier-Journal's Indiana Weekly. Bingham would not comment on the
lawsuit, but said her lawyers are reviewing it.
   The sections of ``Passion and Prejudice'' that most offend the
family are Sallie Bingham's account of her grandfather, Judge Robert
Worth Bingham. She believes the Judge (as he was always called) had
syphilis and suggests in a surprisingly unsubstantiated chapter that
he may have hastened the death of his second wife, Mary Lily Kenan
Flagler, heiress to the Standard Oil fortune and at the time the
richest woman in the United States. The $5 million the Judge
received from a codicil to her will enabled him to buy the
newspapers.
   Bingham now lives in Prospect, Ky., where she devotes her time to
the Kentucky Foundation for Women, an organization that funds arts
projects that ``promote social change'' either overtly or covertly.
She started the foundation three years ago, bankrolling it with $10
million of her fortune.
   She also edits a literary quarterly she started, The American
Voice, which she calls a radical feminist publication. She said she
tells contributors, ``Send us the essay you thought no one would
ever publish.''
   Despite her life of wealth, Sallie Bingham's life has not been
easy. Her oldest and youngest brothers, Worth and Robert Bingham,
died in freak accidents only two years apart in the mid-1960s, and
she had two failed marriages as she struggled with a fiction and
playwriting career before meeting her third husband.
   ``I don't think any amount of money can save you from
experience,'' she observed.

<HEAD>Time-Warner Combo Could Give Marketers Chance at One-Stop Shopping</HEAD>

   The proposed merger of publishing giant Time Inc.
with entertainment heavyweight Warner Communications Inc. could
produce a media hypermarket for advertisers and authors.
   Just as retail hypermarkets offer everything from groceries to
garbage cans under one roof, a Time Warner conglomerate could create
a one-stop market for books, films, magazines, records and cable
television.
   In theory at least, the deal would enable an advertiser in People
or Sports Illustrated magazines to get his product placed in a
Warner Bros. film or in a syndicated Lorimar program like ``Alf''
and then buy commercial time on the movie videocassette or on the
new company's huge cable outlets.
   An author published in hard-cover by a Time book company may be
offered a deal that includes selling paperback, film and music
rights to Warner and the television rights to Warner's Lorimar unit.
   Any movie or TV programs that result from the book could then
debut on Time's Home Box Office or Cinemax cable networks.
   But media and marketing analysts warn that what sounds workable
in theory may not be so easy in practice. They said the magazine,
records, film, cable, book and television syndication operations for
Time and Warner have operated fairly independently over the years
and won't likely cooperate without firm signals from top corporate
management that they do so.
   ``Some of the things that strike one as obvious are not
probable,'' said J. Kendrick Noble, media analyst for PaineWebber.
   He noted that Time has offered a package deal of discounts for
advertisers in its magazines, but never extended it to time on its
82 percent-owned cable system, American Television and
Communications Corp.
   And he said established authors generally can make more money
selling rights to their work in different media separately rather
than in a package.
   More likely, Noble said, is that Time's expertise in direct
marketing could be used effectively to sell Warner's videocassettes
and records.
   David Fulton, media director for the advertising agency FCB-Leber
Katz Partners, said Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. owns television
stations, newspapers and magazines in the United States ``but still
hasn't put together a package that advertisers have been
successfully able to use.''
   John Gray, top media planner at ad agency J. Walter Thompson in
New York, said Gannett Co. has also tried ``with limited success''
to sell packages of space in its newspapers and billboards and time
on its radio and TV stations.
   Fulton said whether size proves a significant advantage to
attract advertisers ``depends a lot on the degree to which (Time
Warner) becomes centralized rather than decentralized'' and the
wishes of top management.
   But will the new bosses speak with one voice on that issue?
   According to the merger plans announced March 4, the new company
will initially have co-chief executives and co-chairmen, J. Richard
Munro from Time and Steven J. Ross from Warner.
   Both Munro and Ross were said to be unavailable for comment on
their plans for the new company by week's end.
   In their surprise announcement, Time and Warner said they had
agreed to merge in an exchange of stock that would create the
world's largest communications company with revenue of $10 billion.
   Company officials said the combination would help them compete
against foreign giants in what is becoming a global communications
market.
   They denied that the merger was designed as a takeover defense,
but analysts say the the deal could do just that.
   But there was speculation that a third party could emerge to
derail the deal by bidding for either company in the months it will
take for regulatory authorities to review the deal before the merger
can be completed.
   In other major business and economic developments this past week:
   _Eastern Airlines filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, citing a six-day-old strike
and losses of $4 million a day. Eastern can still sell billions of
dollars in assets or the whole company if the carrier can convince a
federal bankruptcy judge that it can't otherwise survive. Eastern's
union leaders vowed to keep battling the head of Eastern's parent
company, Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   _In another sign of continuing economic strength, the government
said the nation's unemployment rate plunged to a 15-year low of 5.1
percent in February as employers created 289,000 new jobs.
   _Separate but similar bills to boost the minimum wage by $1.30 an
hour over three years from the current $3.35 began moving through
House and Senate committees. Still unresolved is whether the
legislation will contain a reduced ``training wage'' for new workers
as the Bush administration advocates.
   _The Bush administration, responding to growing instability in
Latin American countries straining under heavy debt loads, unveiled
a new strategy emphasizing debt forgiveness to deal with the
problem. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called for a ``great
cooperative effort'' among all nations to resolve the debt crisis
which has occupied the world for the past seven years.

<HEAD>Eastern Bondholders May Be Hoping For A Piece Of The Plane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple of flotation cushions, a slice of wing
or a cone-shaped metallic nose can make for interesting garden
sculpture and spell satisfaction of sorts for some of Eastern
Airlines' bondholders.
   Now that the strike-crippled carrier is operating under
bankruptcy court protection, hard assets may be the bondholders'
best hope for repayment with more than 15,000 creditors in line for
cash.
   Roughly 25 percent of Eastern's total liabilities of $4.1 billion
are in the form of ``equipment trust certificates,'' which as the
name implies are backed by equipment.
   Holders of these issues, commonly used by transportation
companies, can repossess Eastern's planes under certain
circumstances if the carrier defaults on its interest payments.
   Out of a gamut of creditors ranging from ticket holders to
employees in demand of paychecks, trust certificate holders ``are
clearly in a favorable position,'' said Mike Singer, director of
research at R.D. Smith &amp; Co., a firm specializing in the securities
of ``distressed'' companies.
   Unlike unsecured creditors and shareholders _ whose financial
exposure is not backed by collateral and are therefore last in line
to get paid if a company defaults _ trust certificates are ``good
for bondholders because they have a pool of equipment to back them
up if there is a liquidation,'' said Raymond Neidl, a senior
securities analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei, Inc.
   The market reflected that optimism. When a company seeks Chapter
11 protection from its creditors, bond prices generally are knocked
down. And under these stressful circumstances, major bond-rating
agencies are prompted to lower their ratings on debt securities,
further adding to the downward momentum of prices.
   But although both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's lowered their
ratings on much of Eastern's debt, there was little backlash.
   Bond traders apparently had jumped the gun, pushing Eastern's
debt issues down as much as 10 percent in value in the weeks leading
up to the Chapter 11 filing. So when the news came Thursday that
Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp., was
sending Eastern into bankruptcy protection, bond trading was
relatively unaffected.
   ``There were a lot of low-ball bids, but there were no takers,''
Neidl said. Indeed, Eastern's secured and unsecured bonds lost only
2 percent to 4 percent of their face value that day, not an erosion
that dealers and analysts would consider significant.
   That's because the bankruptcy filing was ``not exactly a total
shock,'' Singer said. Furthermore, ``there is a lot of value in
Eastern one way or another, so its securities should only drop so
far from a psychological aspect, but the fundamentals show that
creditors will get meaningful values for their bonds. Just how much
will be determined by the bankruptcy proceedings.''
   Based on its assets, Eastern might be worth as much as $3.55
billion, according to some analysts' estimates. The figure includes
the carrier's 250-plane fleet, valued at roughly $2.5 billion.
   Lorenzo and other Eastern executives have worked doggedly at
press conferences and in interviews to make assurances that all
creditors will be paid. Their efforts have had at least some calming
effect.
   There is a fear, however, that Eastern blood may spill onto its
corporate parent, Texas Air, and sister carrier Continental. The two
main Wall Street debt-rating services announced they are keeping a
sharp eye Texas Air and Continental for possible downgradings.
   Moody's said Eastern's bankruptcy filing has an ``uncertain
effect'' on each company and noted the possibilty that Texas Air
could be drawn into the proceedings.
   For Eastern bondholders, however, the situation does not appear
terribly grim, analysts said. ``The next stage is to see how
successful (Lorenzo) is in rebuilding'' Eastern, Neidl said.

Change</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About a quarter million Lands' End customers
recently got something extra besides catalogs or the clothing they'd
requested from the mail-order company.
   They received letters warning them that possible changes in the
way state sales taxes are collected could jeopardize the convenience
and raise the cost of shopping at home.
   In an attempt to rally consumers to its cause, Lands' End urged
customers to write their senators or representatives in Washington _
and obligingly provided a sample letter and a list of every state's
delegation to the House of Representatives.
   The Lands' End mailings are the latest salvo in a long-simmering
squabble pitting many mail-order merchants against local, storefront
retailers, who contend the direct mail outfits gain an unfair
advantage by not having to collect most state sales taxes.
   The tensions have been escalating in recent years as mail sales
have mushroomed. The proliferation of toll-free 800 numbers, changes
in lifestyles, growth in the number of people holding
nationally-recognized credit cards, and an assortment of
technological and demographic trends have boosted the direct
marketing business.
   Mail-order sales volume totaled $112 billion in 1987, according
to industry estimates, up 12 percent from 1986's $100 billion. The
business is expected to expand at similar rates in future years,
surpassing the more modest growth of in-store sales.
   At issue is the sales-tax-free status of some merchandise sent
through the mail, ranging from apparel ordered from traditional
catalog companies to trinkets bought from television purveyors.
   Forty-five states and Washington, D.C. have sales taxes on their
books along with ``use'' taxes that theoretically give them the
right to charge sales tax when their residents buy something outside
their home-state borders and bring it home to use it.
   For practical purposes, the use taxes have not been enforced,
except in circumstances spelled out in a 1967 Supreme Court decision.
   The court held that a vendor cannot be required to collect taxes
from an out-of-state customer unless the seller has a business
presence in the state.
   This is why retailers like Sears, Roebuck and Co. or J.C. Penney
Co. Inc. that run mail-order businesses and have stores nationwide
charge taxes on most mail-order goods, while companies like Lands'
End do not. Lands' End only has to collect sales tax for the states
of Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin _ the places where the Dodgeville,
Wis.-based company has offices or warehouses.
   Attempts have been made over the years to empower states to
require more mail-order outlets to collect taxes on shipments made
to customers in other states.
   Various legislation has been proposed on the subject in past
Congressional sessions, but none garnered enough backing to push
them into law.
   But this session of Congress may be different. One bill that
would augment states' tax-collection powers already has been
introduced in the Senate and another is expected soon in the House.
   Of all the issues currently facing state governments, the use tax
matter is one on which there is true consensus, says James L.
Martin, director of state-federal relations for the National
Governors' Association.
   He said the states lost an estimated $2.9 billion in revenue in
one year recently because they couldn't enforce the use tax fully
enough. Capturing the unrealized tax revenue, which is rising by at
least 10 percent a year, is appealing to states that have watched
funding from federal sources dwindle.
   But the revenue element is given secondary billing to competitive
issues by a broad coalition that is lobbying to broaden state
tax-collection power. Besides state governments, the coalition
comprises groups of retailers and organized labor.
   ``Retailers see it as an unfair playing field,'' says Martin.
``Main street retailers are paying all sorts of taxes, such as
property'' and they also must collect the state sales taxes.
   ``Our basic premise is that it's important to level the tax piece
of the playing field,'' Martin says.
   Direct marketers don't see it that way. They contend they would
be burdened with costly administrative duties, such as setting up
systems for tallying sales tax charges and publishing lists of state
sales' tax rates in their catalogs.
   Many companies wouldn't be able to afford the cost, according to
Robert Levering of the Direct Marketing Association.
   Previously proposed legislation exempted from tax collection
tasks any mail-order operations that sold less than $12.5 million
worth of merchandise a year. That would include about 95 percent of
all U.S. direct merchants.
   But Levering said the threshold could inhibit growth of small
outfits and hurt mid-size to large direct merchants already
operating on thin margins.
   For mail-order shoppers, the use tax could have some annoying
consequences.
   People who pay for merchandise by check would have to calculate
sales tax when they send in their money, for instance. An estimated
56 percent of the 88 million customers each year who shop through
catalogs pay by check.
   That inconvenience would come on top of possibly higher prices as
mail-order companies upgrade their systems to handle tax collection.
   ``In the end, mail-order companies will have to pass these
expenses along to you,'' the Lands' End letter to customers
stated.``You will pay higher prices.''

<HEAD>Seattle Plans Garage Shipments to Keep Marshall Islands above Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Fleming wants to ship West Coast garbage to
the Marshall Islands, which he says would keep the dots of dry land
in the South Pacific from being submerged by rising water from the
greenhouse effect.
   But environmentalists say the plan is just a way to make a profit
by unloading garbage on a poor country.
   Fleming admits he thought the idea was ``total insanity'' when he
first heard it. Now he's pushing it as vice president of Admiralty
Pacific Inc., whose principals claim to have seven contracts already
to take compacted trash from Washington, Oregon and California 5,000
miles to the Pacific island chain.
   In an interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer from his
office in San Francisco, Fleming refused to identify the parties to
the seven contracts but said some were private trash haulers and
landfill operators.
   Under the plan, starting in 1990, compacted municipal waste _
nothing hazardous or toxic _ would be loaded on ships in Seattle and
then used to fill lagoons in the island republic, he said.
   Despite the global warming anticipated from the greenhouse
effect, and the resulting melting of polar ice and rising of sea
levels by several feet, the islands would thus remain above water.
   The Marshalls would get $16 million a year for accepting the
garbage, Admiralty Pacific would make about $22 million a year and
the garbage problems of the West Coast would be solved _ if the plan
works.
   ``Some think the project is total insanity and so did I, when I
first got involved in it,'' Fleming said.
   Admiralty's proposal ``is part of a whole grim scheme of
things,'' said Ann Leonard, a researcher for the environmental group
Greenpeace. ``A lot of these exports are increasing as a result of
the high costs of waste disposal.''
   She said the plan seemed to follow a pattern in which private
companies offer lots of money to a poor country to take waste that's
too expensive to dump in the United States.
   ``Their desire for cash is going to outweigh any environmental
impacts,'' Leonard said. ``They are forced to make a choice between
poison and poverty.''
   Fleming explained that the garbage would be spread in a 12-acre
warehouse and swept with electromagnets to extract iron and steel,
workers who paid Admiralty Pacific for the privilege would then
scour the refuse for aluminum and the remaining trash would be
compressed into one-ton bales and wrapped in plastic.
   Hazardous household materials like solvents, cleansers, paints
and batteries would ``hopefully'' be removed by the electromagnets
or the hand-pickers, but ``I'm not going to tell you it's perfect,''
Fleming said. ``There just aren't any guarantees in life.''
   The bales would be carried on ships with double-lined hulls, and
landfills in the Marshalls would be lined and include plumbing to
siphon off any leaching materials, he added. The leachates would be
burned as fuel since they're usually petroleum-based, he added.
   Fleming said he could make a profit while paying $50 a ton for
garbage, a third to a quarter of the hauling costs paid by many
cities.
   He added that it would cost about $20 million to build port
facilities at Majuro, capital atoll of the Marshalls and home to
about half the republic's 31,000 residents.
   Majuro has 2.5 square miles of dry land. The entire republic,
comprising two chains of small islands, has 72 square miles of land.
   The Marshall Islands depend heavily on U.S. aid through rent for
a military base and compensation for damage from atomic bomb testing
in the 1940s.
   Admiralty Pacific president James A. Thompson, who was in the
Marshall Islands during World War II, ``has been toying with the
project for about two years,'' Fleming said.
   Thompson, listed on incorporation documents as the president,
secretary, treasurer, registered agent and only director of
Admiralty Pacific, did not return telephone calls Thursday. Fleming
said there were other directors but refused to name them.
   Fleming said he and other investors were willing to spend as much
as $3 million for an environmental impact statement to assure the
republic that the dumping would be safe while increasing the land
mass of the islands five times in two decades.
   A letter signed in October by Marshall Islands President Amata
Kabua granted Admiralty Pacific an exclusive arrangement, but
telephone interviews with other officials indicated some confusion
about how it was being handled.
   Robert Kelen, general manager of the republic's Environmental
Protection Authority, said he would review the impact statement and
make a recommendation to the president's cabinet on whether to
accept the proposal.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infotechnology Inc., a holding company with
interests in scientific and information ventures, has completed its
acquisition of the company that controls United Press International.
   New York-based Infotech said Thursday it issued roughly 1.5
million shares of common stock it valued at about $16.15 million in
return for the 80 percent of WNW Group Inc. it did not already own.
   Infotech Chairman Earl W. Brian created WNW a year ago to take
control of UPI from Mexican publisher Mario Vasquez Rana. It does
not own the news service outright, but WNW controls how UPI shares
are voted and retains an irrevocable option to buy the news service.
   Meanwhile, the Dutch investment partnership Avacus Partners LP
said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Wednesday that it has increased its stake in Infotech from 8.03
percent to 9.27 percent.
   Avacus said it has discussed takeover financing with ``a major
money center bank'' and that it might sell off all or part of
Infotech to finance a takeover. Avacus also said it may protest the
WNW purchase, claiming it dilutes Infotech's stock.
   Infotech spokeswoman Amber Gordon noted that the stock
transaction with WNW was not a defensive measure to ward off an
unwanted takeover and had been contemplated for some time.
   Infotech has wide-ranging holdings of medical, scientific and
information companies including two cable television channels,
Financial News Network and The Learning Channel.

<HEAD>Nissan Boosts Prices on Two-Door Pathfinder by $1,500</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average price of a two-door Nissan Pathfinder
sport-utility vehicle will increase $1,500 effective Monday because
of a higher tariff on the Japanese-made vehicle, the company said
Friday.
   Thomas D. Mignanelli, executive vice president for operations of
Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., said in a news release that the
company will absorb some of the higher tariff, but most of it would
be passed on to the customer.
   On Feb. 16, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a list of
vehicles it classified as trucks, and subject to a 25 percent duty,
and cars, for which importers had to pay a 2.5 percent tariff.
   The two-door Pathfinder fell in the truck category.
   ``We regret being forced to take this action,'' Mignanelli said
Friday, ``but the Treasury Department's decision left us no
recourse. Nissan still believes the ruling is an unnecessary and
unwarranted tax on consumers.''
   Nissan continues to hold out the possibility that production of
the two-door Pathfinder could be moved from Japan to the company's
plant in Smyrna, Tenn., removing the tariff charge.
   But company spokesman Bill Pauli said Friday no decision has been
reached on that.
   A four-door version of the Pathfinder, which the Treasury
Department classifies as a car and subject to a 2.5 percent duty, is
to be introduced in late autumn or early winter, Pauli added.

   Sotheby's Holdings Inc., the parent company of the
auction house, said Friday its fourth-quarter profit more than
doubled from a year ago, primarily because of strong auction sales.
   Sotheby's said net income for the three months came to $31.4
million, or $1.11 a share, compared with $15 million, or 59 cents a
share, in the same period a year ago.
   Operating revenue jumped 45 percent to $143.1 million from $99

   For the year, net income rose 60 percent to $61.9 million, or
$2.20 a share, from $38.7 million, or $1.54 a share, in 1987.
   Twelve-month operating revenue rose 25 percent to $349 million
from $279 million.
   Michael Ainslie, president of Sotheby's Holdings, said the strong
auction sales, particularly in paintings, as well as good returns
from the company's financing arm contributed to the profits surge.

   Tishman Realty &amp; Construction Co. Inc. said
Friday it would become the first U.S. company to launch a
construction project in Japan's private sector since an agreement to
open Japan to American builders was reached last May.
   Tishman said its Japanese arm would form a joint venture with
Japan's Aoki Corp. to build a 400-room, $200 million luxury
high-rise hotel in Osaka, to be operated by Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts.
   Construction is scheduled to begin in April 1990 and be completed
in March 1993. Tishman and Aoki will serve jointly as construction
managers while Aoki serves as general contractor.
   The agreement signed by U.S. and Japanese officials in May 1988
called for Japan to encourage foreign participation in major public
works projects financed by the Japanese government and other
projects carried out by Japanese companies with funding from both
the local and central governments.
   One aspect of the agreement was to make it easier for American
firms to get construction licenses in Japan. Tishman Construction
Corp. of Japan got a license in October to do both public- and
private-sector work.

<HEAD>World Bank Offers Brazil $1 Billion For Electricity Development</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank offered the country $1
billion for electric power development, the Planning Ministry said
Friday.
   The bank's representative for Brazil, Armeane Choksi, proposed
the loan in a meeting Thursday with Planning Minister Joao Batista
de Abreu, the ministry said.
   Last year, the World Bank suspended payment of an approved $500
million loan for the electric power sector after Brazil put its
nuclear program under the aegis of the state electric company.
   The bank questioned the economic feasibility of the proposed
Angra III nuclear plant, which hasn't been built yet. However, many
Brazilian believe the real problem was environmental concerns
regarding the nuclear plant and proposed hydrolectric dams in the
Amazon rain forest.
   The suspension of the loan led foreign private banks to withhold
$600 million in new loans, part of an $82.2 billion loan package
approved last September. The new money was tied to the release of
the World Bank loan.
   President Jose Sarney has vowed to cut government spending as
part of an economic reform program announced Jan. 15 to halt 1,000
percent annual inflation.
   Abreu called the offers ``positive'' and stressed the importance
of ``reversing the negative flow'' of funds from Brazil to the World
Bank. The government currently pays the bank more than it receives.

   Wall Street analysts are worried that the stock
market will soon have to cope with more troublesome news on
inflation.
   But, at the same time, they note that stocks have stood up pretty
well of late to the challenge of all the negative talk about the
inflation outlook.
   The government is due to report Friday on the producer price
index of finished goods for February. This gauge of inflationary
pressures startled many investors when it took a 1 percent jump in
January.
   ``Another stiff increase _ 0.6 percent _ seems likely in the
February report,'' says the current Merrill Lynch Market Letter.
   ``Higher interest rates probably will slow inflation eventually,
but we're likely to see more unpleasant numbers before the tide
turns.''
   The presumption that the tide will indeed turn sooner or later
appears to have helped to keep inflation worries from inflicting
much damage on the stock market to date.
   When the Labor Department reported Friday that the unemployment
rate fell to a 15-year low in February, it sent out a strong signal
that a long-predicted slowing of economic growth had not yet
materialized.
   The news was not well received in either the stock or bond
markets, but neither one suffered any dramatic selloff.
   ``We believe that the concern about wage and capacity pressures
is overblown,'' said Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
``We are not forecasting a decline in the inflation rate at this
time, but nor are we expecting an acceleration.''
   For the year as a whole, Sherman predicts that the inflation rate
will run in the 4 percent to 4{ percent range.
   Most stock traders seemed to take a similar view in the past
week. Even with the news of stronger-than-expected employment growth
on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials managed to post a
7.85 gain to 2,282.14 for the week.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose .95 to 164.85;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
1.91 to 405.90, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 2.70 at 328.92.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 159.80 million shares a day, up
from 155.66 million the week before.
   The recent flareup of inflation worries recalls a similar scare
last summer that was induced largely by drought in many agricultural
areas of the country, observed Donald Carver, president of Centre
Square Investment Group in Philadelphia.
   ``In the current environment, inflationary concerns appear
somewhat premature,'' he said. ``While price pressures bear
watching, we expect economic activity to begin to decelerate.
   ``Gold is trading near its lows, a sign that inflation
expectations are not very high.''
   Despite recent surprises in the statistics, ``an economic
slowdown is clearly in the cards,'' maintains John Connolly at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``This is obviously what the Federal Reserve has in mind, and we
believe the Fed has the determination to make it happen. The only
questions are when it will occur and from what interest-rate level.
   ``Activity later this year will be burdened by the full brunt of
the recent interest-rate increases, so it is increasingly likely
that some month soon will show a definitive slowdown.
   ``The bond market would love to see a slowdown,'' Connolly
concluded, ``and stocks would respond to any rally in bonds.''

<HEAD>Attorneys Argue Motions On Geneva Steelworkers' Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for 1,700 steelworkers at the
Geneva Works when it was owned by USX Corp. has told a federal judge
the company defrauded the workers when it reneged on a promise to
keep the mill open through 1989.
   Wyoming attorney Gerry Spence on Friday presented arguments on
one of three pretrial motions in a 1987 lawsuit in which the
steelworkers claimed to have lost wages, severance pay and insurance
and pension benefits when USX sold the Orem steel mill to a Utah
company.
   U.S. District Senior Judge Bruce Jenkins' courtroom was crowded
with about 300 steelworkers who listened as several attorneys argued
the merits of USX's motion for a partial summary judgment.
   USX sold Geneva to Basic Manufacturing Technologies of Utah in
August 1987, 13 months after the aging plant had been shut down by a
labor dispute and subsequently placed on ``indefinate idle'' status
by USX.
   The plant has operated since then under the name Geneva Steel.
   The plaintiffs cited a 1986 letter mailed to every Geneva worker
from USX Chairman David Roderick, who assured them the Utah plant
would not close its doors until the end of 1989.
   They contend the letter superseded a collective bargaining
agreement between the workers and the United Steelworkers of America
because it was an independent contract between Roderick and each
individual worker.

<HEAD>Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filings Not Always by Companies in the Red</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies like Eastern Airlines usually file for
bankruptcy protection after years of losses. But some of the most
prominent Chapter 11 filings over the past decade have been by
companies running in the black.
   When Texaco Inc., the nation's third-largest oil company, asked a
federal bankruptcy court to protect it from creditors in April 1987,
it was solvent. So was Manville Corp. when it filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in August 1982 and A.H. Robins Co. Inc. when it filed
in August 1985.
   The difference between these cases and the more common bankruptcy
court filings by companies going broke is the three firms were
trying to avoid the possibility of future financial ruin from
massive legal claims.
   By filing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, a
company can reorganize its business protected from claims by
creditors, including legal claimants.
   Texaco filed for bankruptcy protection because of a $10.3 billion
judgment won against the oil giant by Pennzoil Co. in 1985. Pennzoil
had charged Texaco with interfering with Pennzoil's plans to acquire
Getty Oil Co.
   Texaco said it filed for protection to avoid having to post a
potentially devastating $11 billion security bond required under
Texas law during the appeals process.
   But, more importantly, the filing put pressure on Pennzoil to
settle the dispute.
   Without a settlement, Texaco's reorganization could have become a
drawn-out process and Pennzoil might not have seen any money for
years. With their $3 billion agreement, the reorganization plan was
wrapped up a year after Texaco's filing.
   Manville and Robins each were facing thousands of claims from
individuals _ Manville from people made ill by its asbestos
products, and Robins from women injured by its Dalkon Shield
intrauterine birth control device.
   Both companies said they would be wiped out if they had to pay
all the claims facing them. Their filings were a form of damage
control.
   Manville's bankruptcy court filing was considered novel when it
was first made. The company emerged from bankruptcy protection last
November. Its reorganization plan provided for up to 200,000
asbestos claimants to share in a $3 billion trust fund set up to
compensate.
   The Robins plan, which is pending, provides $2.5 billion to
settle nearly 200,000 claims.
   None of these companies had lost money because of the claims
against them.
   Eastern, however, had verged on a bankruptcy filing for years.
The airline said in court papers it had lost $1.02 billion this
decade. It listed $4.5 billion in assets, $3.39 billion in
liabilities, and 15,696 creditors.
   The bankruptcy filing was triggered and complicated by a walkout
by mechanics, pilots and flight attendants a week ago.
   At first blush, Eastern's filing may seem totally different from
cases like Texaco, Manville or Robins. But Richard D'Aveni, a
professor at Dartmouth's College Amos Tuck School of Business
Administration, saw some similarities.
   A bankruptcy filing is leverage, whether it's used by a company
like Texaco, seeking an advantage over a single opponent, or by a
firm like Eastern, trying to work its way out of a tangle of red
ink, D'Aveni said.
   ``It's one way to bargain with and reallocate the power among the
stakeholders,'' D'Aveni said in an interview.
   ``That's the purpose of the bankuptcy law,'' he said.
   Even in a Manville or Robins situation, where a company is facing
thousands of claims, a filing forces the company and creditors into
negotiations. In such cases, thousands of claimants against a
company are joined into a class represented by the same attorneys.
   In a case like Texaco's, the bankruptcy law has another advantage
_ it can be used as a way around the heavy financial penalties meted
out by antitrust laws, D'Aveni said.
   He considered it likely that more companies would file under
Chapter 11 when faced with claims similar to those faced by these
companies.
   He was right. It happened again this past week.
   Raytech Corp., a manufacturing holding company, filed for
protection from creditors on Friday. The company has been named a
co-defendant in more than 1,000 lawsuits brought by people claiming
to have been injured by asbestos used in the past by one of the
company's businesses.

<HEAD>Raytech Files For Chapter 11 To Resolve Asbestos Question</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 8th graf, Asbestos fibers, to UPDATE with
assets and liabilities.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anxious to protect itself from potential
asbestos liability claims arising out of a past business, Raytech
Corp. on Friday filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of federal bankruptcy laws.
   ``This is not an issue of failing businesses, but rather one
related to getting the structure issues resolved in a single
courtroom with national jurisdiction,'' said Craig R. Smith, Raytech
president and chief executive officer.
   Raytech, a multinational manufacturing holding company based in
Shelton, Conn., said in a prepared statement that it was forced to
take its voluntary action in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Bridgeport,
Conn., because ``all other potential avenues for resolution of the
issue in the courts have proven to be ineffective or impossible.''
   The bankruptcy action involves only the holding company and not
any of its manufacturing subsidiaries. Raytech makes specialty
engineered products for industrial, auto, aerospace and military
customers. In addition to the United States, it has plants in West
Germany, Puerto Rico and Japan.
   The filing was the lastest in a complex case in which Raytech has
sought to avoid involvement in any costly asbestos lawsuits.
   Raytech was formed in 1986 in a bid to shelter the assets of
Raymark Industries Inc. from asbestos-related lawsuits. Raytech
acquired assets from Raymark in 1987, but as part of the agreement
Raymark agreed to protect Raytech against all asbestos-related
liabilities.
   Shareholders approved the deal as about 30,000 lawsuits filed by
former employees were pending against the company. Raymark, a
Stratford company, had used asbestos in brake linings.
   Asbestos fibers, when inhaled, permanently scar lung tissue in a
progressive and debilitating condition known as asbestosis. Lung
cancer and heart disease also have been linked to inhalation of
asbestos fibers.
   Al Canosa, Raytech's vice president, said the Chapter 11 petition
seeking protection from creditors while the company reorganizes
listed $26 million in assets and said total liabilities were
``unknown and disputed.''
   Despite the maneuver to protect its assets, Raytech has been
named a co-defendant with Raymark in more than 1,000 lawsuits. The
action taken Friday will force the court determine whether asbestos
claimants have a legal right to seek damages from Raytech, the
company said.
   In February, an involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed against
Raymark, which resulted in Raytech's loss of indemnification by
Raymark.
   ``We paid Raymark Industries fair-market value for the assets
acquired and we did not acquire any assets or businesses that gave
rise to asbestos-related claims,'' Smith said.
   ``It is our belief and has been from the time of restructuring
that Raytech would be free from any asbestos-related liabilities
flowing from past businesses of Raymark Industries,'' he said.
   Raytech has no insurance coverage for asbestos-related
liabilities, and Smith said the lawsuits threaten the future
existence of Raytech.
   Raytech, which manufactures fastners and inertia control
products, had a net income, excluding unusual items, of $7.7 million
on sales of $127.3 million in 1988. That compared with earnings of
$6.6 million on sales of $132.4 million a year earlier.
   Manville Corp., another large company who used asbestos in its
products, in 1982 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy when faced with
thousands of absestos lawsuits. The company, formerly the nation's
largest asbestos producer, emerged from bankruptcy protection in
1986 after a reorganization plan established a $2.5 billion fund for
asbestos victims.

<HEAD>Frank Lorenzo's Aim: Make Money, Corner the Industry Through Texas
Air</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soon after adding Eastern Airlines to his
collection of wayward carriers, Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank
Lorenzo boasted in 1986 that he had envisioned the possibility of
Eastern seeking bankruptcy protection.
   To prevent the drain of Texas Air assets to Eastern in times of
need, the man who shrunk Continental Airlines and broke its unions
after a similar takeover devised a setup keeping Eastern financially
independent of its parent.
   He bragged that the only ties between the airlines were Texas
Air's initial cash outlay and some dividends guaranteed after four
years. But he predicted ``thrashing'' and ``changes'' in those four
years, implying those 1990 payments wouldn't ever happen.
   ``Eastern could go into Chapter 11 and it would not affect what
we do,'' Lorenzo said, according to a transcript of a December 1986
meeting with pilots. ``Having said that, I don't think the Eastern's
going to go into Chapter 11. I think the unions are going to
negotiate because I think they realize that the last place they want
to be is in Chapter 11.''
   Of course, the aggressive Machinists union didn't negotiate and
was joined by pilots in a walkout Eastern claims forced it to seek
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law
last week.
   Critics say Lorenzo, the one-time wonder boy of the airline
industry unions now label a ``robber baron,'' isn't fazed by the
prospect of bankruptcy after a 17-month management-labor slugfest.
   They say Chapter 11 may indeed be the last place the unions want
to be because it gives Lorenzo a chance to bust them and slash the
assets of an airline $2.5 billion in debt, possibly consolidating
Eastern and Continental.
   And they detect a pattern in Frank Lorenzo's 20 years in the
industry _ the piecemeal acquisition of components in building the
dominant megacarrier in the age of deregulation.
   To Lorenzo, making money _ not sentimental attachments to
airlines like Eastern, one of the nation's four original majors _ is
what has mattered.
   ``He is in the money business, not the airline business. In the
airline business you have to be people-oriented,'' said Paul Gibson
Jr., an American Airlines vice president in the 1970s and
early-1980s who now practices law in New York.
   How did Lorenzo, the 48-year-old son of Spanish immigrants,
manage to build Texas Air from a tiny intra-state flier mockingly
dubbed Tree Top Airlines into the nation's largest carrier?
   Lorenzo and a Harvard Business School classmate pooled about
$2,000 in 1966 to form Jet Capital Corp, an aircraft leasing company
Lorenzo critics say was little more than an excuse for an office in
New York's Pan Am Building.
   Tiny Jet Capital in 1972 bought a controlling interest in Trans
Texas Airlines, renamed it Texas Air International _ thanks to a
single border hop into Mexico _ and Lorenzo became president.
   Lorenzo exploited federal regulation to get loans for planes to
expand Texas Air's fleet. Long before deregulation, the airline
offered discount rates Lorenzo called ``Peanut Fares'' and got
national attention.
   In 1978 Lorenzo tried to acquire National Airlines, then a major
carrier. The action triggered a bidding war among the major
airlines, and Pan Am eventually outbid rivals for the airline, but
not before Lorenzo made about $40 million from the sale of National
stock.
   ``It was a fear of deregulation and Pan Am had to get a domestic
route system,'' said one longtime airline industry official with no
love for Lorenzo. ``It literally wrecked the airline.''
   In 1980, Lorenzo tried to buy Trans World Airlines and formed
non-union New York Air to compete with Eastern on the East Coast.
The empire grew.
   The post-deregulation era was one of the shakiest in the
industry. But in 1982, during a time of high fuel costs, airline
consolidation and low passenger demand, Lorenzo grabbed beleaguered
Continental _ which lost $100 million the year before _ and its
Midwest strength for $100 million.
   Despite cash reserves of about $80 million, Lorenzo took
Continental into bankruptcy in 1983, abrogated union contracts, cut
staff by two-thirds, flew through a strike and emerged with a
non-union airline _ and the ire of labor.
   ``He was one of the first to recognize that in order to reduce
fares he had to reduce costs from the traditional cost structures of
the ailines,'' labor, supplies and debt financing, said James Carey,
research vice president for Airline Economics Inc. in Washington.
   In 1985, Lorenzo made unsuccessful passes at TWA and Frontier
Airlines.
   A year later, with Continental still in bankruptcy court, Texas
Air snatched foundering People Express, with its Newark, N.J. hub,
and the assets of People Express subsidiary Frontier, which provided
a Denver base, for about $300 million. The Eastern deal, for $676
million, followed shortly.
   Industry sources said Lorenzo bought Eastern to get the final
piece of the puzzle _ a computerized national reservation system
that he transferred to Texas Air for a bargain price of $100
million. One source said Eastern was offered $350 million for the
computer system alone.
   His critics say Lorenzo's goal then was to get concessions from
Eastern's unions and pare down the money-losing carrier even more;
Eastern sold its Kansas City, Mo., hub last year, and with court
approval plans to sell the Northeast shuttle to Donald Trump and
gates and routes from Philadelphia.
   Bankruptcy protection allows Lorenzo the chance to reduce labor
costs even more by seeking to dissolve union contracts on the
grounds that Eastern was propelled into court by the pilots' walkout.
   ``He moves stuff around and he tries to build houses of cards,''
one critic said. ``Even when they're collapsing, as in bankruptcy,
he'll find some new and novel way to exploit it further. It's as if
the collapse was planned.''
   Lorenzo defenders say he exploited industry turmoil following
deregulation in 1978 and cannily crafted the megacarrier he sought,
if at the expense of tens of thousands of jobs, stranded passengers
and unpaid creditors.
   ``With deregulation and the ability to shift assets and merge and
acquire with relative freedom, what Frank has been doing is probably
part of a general trend in this country,'' said Carey of Airline
Economics.
   ``The big distinction you make with Lorenzo and airline
managements is he is more of a specialist on the art of the
financial side _ what Trump calls the art of the deal _ than most
managers, who have a history and background in the airline,'' he
said.
   Lorenzo would agree.
   ``The issue,'' he said last week after Eastern filed for Chapter
11, ``is fundamentally whether a troubled and sick business in a
competitive marketplace should be allowed to change itself and
manage its survival.''

<HEAD>Subaru Of America Announces Voluntary Recall Of Justy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Subaru of America announced Friday it
will voluntarily recall 15,000 Justy four-wheel-drive vehicles
because of transmission fluid problems that can cause the rear
wheels to lock.
   The vehicles subject to recall are those manufactured for the
1988 and 1989 model years before March 10, 1989, said spokesman
Steve Davis.
   Insufficient levels of transmission fluid may result because of
incorrect fluid level prescribed by Subaru, the checking procedure
described in the owner's manual and the design of the fluid
dipstick, Davis said.
   Low fluid level can cause ball bearing seizure and possible
rear-wheel lockup, he said.
   ``There were a few cars where customers had rear-wheel lockup
because of the bearing seizure,'' Davis said. ``No accidents or any
bodily injuries were associated with that, just mechanical damage.
   ``We're bringing these cars in and actually raising the level of
fluid in the transmission,'' Davis said.
   In addition, a modified dipstick will be installed and an insert
for the owner's manual describing correct transmission fluid
checking procedures will be provided at no cost to the owner, he
said.
   All affected owners will be notified by mail, the company said.
   The problem does not affect the two-wheel drive Justy, Davis said.

   Angels rookie Jim Abbott pitched three innings in relief. He
retired the first six batters he faced before the Brewers collected
two hits and two runs.
   Brewers team physician Paul Jacobs confirmed that lefthanded

him idle for about 10 days.
   If the rest period doesn't help the shoulder and surgery is
required, Nieves could be out for four to six weeks. Jacobs said.
