<HEAD>Voyager 2 Changes Course For Neptune Encounter</HEAD>

   The Voyager 2 space probe fired
thrusters and used onboard gyroscopes Thursday to make one of the
last maneuvers needed to propel it toward a close encounter with
Neptune in August, NASA said.
   ``This puts the spacecraft on target for Neptune,'' said Mary
Beth Murrill, spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 was 2.67 billion miles from Earth and 183 million
miles from Neptune on Thursday, four months from the end of its
12-year journey to the giant ball of gas, which is the solar
system's eighth planet.
   Thursday's maneuver ``aimed the spacecraft toward the point at
which it will most closely fly by Neptune, passing just 3,013 miles
from the planet's cloud tops at 9 p.m. PDT on Aug. 24,'' NASA said
in a news release. ``Five hours later, the spacecraft will fly
about 24,000 miles from Neptune's moon Triton.''
   The hardy space probe, launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in
1977, explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
Pictures taken by its television cameras _ as well as those onboard
its twin Voyager 1 probe _ vastly increased scientists' knowledge
of the giant outer planets.
   Thursday's change-of-trajectory maneuver started at 11:01 a.m.
PDT and ended at 1:20 p.m. while Voyager zipped through space at
42,279 mph, Murrill said.
   Because Voyager 2 is so far away, commands radioed to it at the
speed of light take nearly four hours to reach the probe. The
spacecraft is controlled with radio commands sent through NASA's
Deep Space Network, which includes large dish-shaped antennas in
Goldstone, Calif., Spain and Australia.
   Murrill said that while some thrusters were fired to help
execute the course change, mission controllers also used the
probe's onboard gyroscopes to make the spacecraft roll and turn.
   The roll-turn ``served as the first and only rehearsal for a
similar maneuver that the spacecraft will execute when Voyager is
just four days from its closest approach to Neptune,'' NASA said.
   That maneuver will allow controllers to maintain radio contact
with the probe so they can continue to send it crucial commands to
carry out its exploration of Neptune.
   The latest maneuver ``was performed during a week of simulations
in which the Voyager team is rehearsing what they will be doing
during the Neptune encounter,'' Murrill said.
   After encountering Neptune, Voyager 2 will leave the solar
system and begin its study of interstellar space.

   A United Airlines jet blew all the tires on its
right side upon landing Thursday on Hawaii Island, but there were
no injuries among the passengers and crew, officials said.
   The tires on the left side of the DC-8 also were flattened
during the landing at the Keahole-Kona airport, said state
Department of Transportation spokeswoman Marilyn Kali.
   The 163 passengers and nine crew members aboard United Flight 31
from San Francisco evacuated the plane by stairs after the 11:16
a.m. landing, she said, and emergency slides were not required.
   The airport closed for three hours while pieces of the rubber
tires were removed from the runway and replacement tires were flown
in from Honolulu so the plane could be moved, she said.
   United officials said they did not know what caused the
blowouts. Rob Doughty, a spokesman at United headquarters in
Chicago, said mechanics would fly from Honolulu to check the plane.
   A larger plane Friday would accomodate passengers unable to make
their connecting flights Thursday, he said.
   Doughty said the aircraft would be retired this fall along with
the rest of United's DC-8 fleet.

   After three stimulating dances, the Paul Taylor
Dance Company concluded its Thursday night program at the City
Center with the premiere of the delightful, light-hearted, funny
``Minikin Fair.''
   The music sounded like a circus and the dancers, in baggy
leotards with scanty coverups added, became amateur circus
performers. They somersaulted in twos, the men groaning when
attempting to lift the women. A virtuoso in a bathing cap tumbled;
he made it look like diving.
   A ``faerie king and queen,'' Christopher Gillis and Mary Cochran
replacing the injured Kate Johnson, had a dance which appeared to
be based on ballet's bluebird pas de deux. But she slipped out of
his grasp. There is nothing funnier to a dance audience than
parodies of ballet.
   One dancer was in a collapsible green pipe, forcing him to crawl
like an insect. Three women in petal dresses got chains of flowers
caught in the petals as they danced. A couple inside the same
garment seemed to be skating. A woman juggled three scarves.
   ``Minikin Fair'' followed a brief, funny dance, ``3 Epitaphs,''
from 1956. That one, to a recording of ragged early New Orleans
jazz, has five people apparently covered in mud. They come out of
the ooze, shake their flippers or scratch like monkeys, then slouch
offstage, presumably back into the ooze, deciding against evolution
after all.
   The evening began with ``Syzygy,'' which presents perpetual
motion and in which Linda Kent was fabulous, and ``Dust,'' which
has a leader of the blind going blind, in one section.
   Paul Taylor choreographed everything. The company will be at the
City Center through May 7.

   Audrey Hepburn told Manhattan schoolchildren
that her own tough childhood helped inspire her to become a UNICEF
goodwill ambassador.
   ``I lived through the second World War in Europe,'' she said at
a convocation at St. Catherine of Siena School on Thursday. ``Right
after the war, I was a rather hungry child and my health was very
much impaired. Immediately after our liberation, UNICEF came in
with food and medication.''
   The actress told the kids, ages 6 to 14, about her travels last
week in the civil war-wracked Sudan.
   ``As always happens in wars, it's the people, especially
children, who are the victims,'' she said. ``I've seen so many
children who are ill, who are going blind because they don't have
enough food, who don't have any toys; some of them don't have their
parents anymore.''
   When a student asked how to help the children of Sudan, she
replied: ``By remembering them, feeling close to them. If you like,
you can send some pennies to UNICEF.''

   The show's producer and creator of the Ernest character,
Nashville advertising executive John Cherry, said the program with
the rubber-necked rube just couldn't stand up to cartoons.
   ``I'm sad,'' Cherry said. ``The numbers (ratings) just didn't
hold up against the cartoons. The show received a lot of critical
acclaim and high marks but didn't pull the numbers.''
   Despite CBS's cancellation announcement Wednesday, fans haven't
seen the last of Ernest. Cherry said production is scheduled to
begin in August on ``Ernest Spaced Out,'' the third Touchstone
Pictures feature movie starring Varney.
   The Ernest character also has been seen in a variety of

   Former baseball player Dale Berra, son
of Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra, was arrested and charged with
conspiring to buy cocaine.
   Berra, 32, was among 23 people named in warrants issued after a
six-month investigation, Lee Trumbull, the Morris County
prosecutor, and Police Chief Jay White said in a joint statement.
   Berra was arraigned Thursday and bond was set at $5,000. He was
arrested at his Glen Ridge, N.J., home and charged with conspiracy
to violate state narcotic laws, said Lt. John Dempsey, a spokesman
for Trumbull.
   Berra is accused of meeting several times with an alleged drug
dealer.
   Berra played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the New York Yankees
during his major league career. His career ended last season when
he was released from a Baltimore Orioles' minor league team.

   Soul singer James Brown, after four
months in prison, said during an interview at the State Park Health
Center that he'd like to return to gospel singing.
   Brown, 55, serving a six-year sentence on a charge of aggravated
assault and failing to stop for police during a chase, is working
on kitchen detail in the mornings. But in the evenings, Brown whose
gold records include ``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag'' is conducting
the prison choir.
   ``I'd like to go back to gospel,'' Brown told The Boston Globe
in an interview from jail. ``Really I never left. Or it never left
me. The public may not know it, but the Sex Machine first did it to
death for the Lord.''
   Brown sees a double standard in that no politicians have come to
his aid. He said he helped quell riots in the '60s, sang at Richard
Nixon's inauguration party and lent his fame to various anti-drug
pronouncements.
   ``Politics and reality is so different now that reality doesn't
have anything to do with politics anymore,'' Brown said. ``All the
people in Watergate, they out of jail, now, right?''

   Comedian Jackie Mason won't be
appearing in person next month, but a videotaped deposition in a
$20 million libel suit against Clarion Castle Hotel owner Abe
Hirschfeld will get top billing.
   Both parties received a copy of the deposition in which Mason
curses repeatedly and mocks Hirschfeld's Eastern European accent.
The hotel owner is thrilled about the upcoming showing on giant
television screens.
   ``You'll see the real Jackie Mason. We are going to feature it
like we do the big fights,'' Hirschfeld said Thursday.
   Mason, who did the one-man Broadway show called ``The World
According to Me,'' is suing Hirschfeld over the hotelier's claims
that he set the comedian's career back on track and should get up
to 30 percent of his earnings.
   ``You had nothing to do with my career,'' Mason shouts at
Hirschfeld on the videotape, calling him a liar.
   Mason, who charges about $65,000 per appearance, also said in
the tape that if Hirschfeld were his management adviser, ``I was
Lincoln's adviser to the Gettysburg Address.''

   Dan Davidson had begun thinking about
retirement from the Kentucky State Police when his most memorable
case began unfolding in Oldham County almost five years ago.
   Now, the case is the subject of ``Bitter Blood,'' a book written
by North Carolina newspaper columnist Jerry Bledsoe that recently
topped The New York Times best-sellers list.
   Negotiations are under way to turn the story into a motion
picture in which Davidson will serve as a consultant.
   After being assigned the investigation of two of the nine
slayings the book covers, all thoughts of retiring left Davidson's
mind. He became obsessed with finding the killer.
   But after 30 years of service, Davidson retired May 31, 1987,
from the Kentucky State Police. He said that after that case, it
seemed ``everything was downhill. Nothing interested me anymore.''

   A legal struggle to decide who is
the wife of the slain hero-ecologist Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes
could thwart efforts of international filmmakers to make a movie of
his life.
   Eunice Feitosa de Menezes, who claims to be Mendes' first and
only legal wife, has asked a court in Acre, his home state, to
confirm her marital status so she can contest any film rights
allotted the recognized widow, Ilzamar Mendes.
   Mendes, 44, a rubber tappers union leader who fought to save the
Amazon from deforestation, was killed by the son of a cattle
rancher Dec. 22 outside his modest wooden house in Xapuri, 2,666
miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Mendes had won a United Nations award for his struggle against
Amazon ranchers wanting to clear the rain forests for grazing.
   Hollywood producers, seeing dramatic value in a story about a
confrontation between powerful Amazon landowners and humble rubber
tree tappers, have been turning up in Brazil to see about shooting
a movie about Mendes, regarded by many as the world's first
environmental martyr.
   Gilson Pescador, a member of the Chico Mendes Foundation, said
offers have come from Robert Redford, representing 20th Century
Fox, from United Artists, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Inc.,
Ted Turner from Atlanta, and a number of British and Brazilian film
companies.
   For the moment, the decision on who will get the authorized film
rights, along with cooperation from Mendes' Brazilian colleagues,
lies with a four-member panel from the foundation, an organization
made up of ecologists, rubber tappers and Mendes' family members.
   But panel members are concerned that a court battle pitting
Eunice Menezes against Ilzamar Mendes could discourage film
producers and scuttle the project, said Pescador.
   He and other foundation members say Menezes and her lawyer are
backed by the right-wing Rural Democratic Union, a powerful group
of landowners that rubber tappers and local Roman Catholic leaders
allege took part in the Mendes shooting.
   ``This is an underhanded attempt by the Rural Union to descredit
Chico and demoralize our movement to save the forest,'' Pescador
said in an interview. ``The Rural Union fears the movie will make
Chico an even greater hero than he is now.''
   The Rural Union denies the accusations.
   Also at stake is the money the project would bring to the rubber
tappers, estimated at more than $300,000, Pescador said.
   ``We need economic resources to continue our work,'' he added.
``The movement is in a delicate stage after Chico's death, and our
opponents know it.''
   The Rural Union, which spent millions of dollars in a successful
lobby effort to water down land reform clauses in Brazil's new
constitution, says it doesn't oppos a Chico Mendes movie.
   ``If the film shows what really happened with dignity and is
backed up with official evidence presented in court, we would
welcome such a production,'' Roosevelt dos Santos, president of the
Rural Union, said by telephone from Brasilia, the capital.
   But Mary Helena Alegretti, a member of the Mendes Foundation
panel, charged that the landowners' group had sought out Menezes
and her daughter with other motives.
   ``The Rural Union is trying to show the world that Chico wasn't
such a good, innocent boy after all,'' she said.
   ``All I know is that I was married to Chico,'' Ilzamar Mendes
told The Associated Press, maintaining that she married him in Acre
in 1983.
   But Menezes' lawyer, Norival Valadao, who has defended Rural
Union cattle ranchers in numerous cases against squatters,
ecologists and the rubber tappers, said Mendes never divorced
Menezes, thus invalidating his marriage to Ilzamar.
   Valadao said he had the certificate from Mendes' church wedding
to Menezes, the baptism certificate of his first child by Menezes,
and the index of a town hall register documenting the marriage.
   ``The page listing Mendes' wedding was torn out,'' he said.
``But I still have enough evidence to serve justice and annul his
second marriage.''
   Pescador said, ``There is not one document proving that this
woman was married to Chico.'' But he conceded that Menezes was the
mother of Mendes' 20-year-old daughter, Angela Maria.
   Alegretti said Angela Maria would be considered a Mendes family
member when it came time to divide the family's share of film
rights.
   Ilzamar Mendes, her two children and Mendes' brother and sisters
would receive 15 percent of the royalties. Another 15 percent would
be donated to the rubber tappers union and other such organizations
in Acre. The remainder would go to education and health projects
for Indians and rubber tappers throughout the Amazon, Alegretti
said.
   ``No one here is trying to get rich on these projects,'' she
said. ``We're doing it to get Chico's message out. That's what he
would have wanted.''

   A beloved leader dies. Thousands march to
Beijing's central square to express grief and anger. The
government, afraid, suppresses them.
   The scenario, played out 13 years ago in what became known as
the Tiananmen Incident, is being repeated with haunting
similarities as students mourn former Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang and demand political reforms.
   There are also striking differences, reflecting changes that
have made China a more open and slightly more tolerant society.
   In April 1976, the mourning was for Premier Chou En-lai,
regarded by many as the last voice of reason and moderation in an
age of political insanity known as the Cultural Revolution.
   Chou died of cancer in January 1976. Revolutionary leader Mao
Tse-tung was on his deathbed. Power was in the hands of the
ultra-leftist faction headed by Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, which came
to be called the ``Gang of Four.''
   The leftists attempted to stifle mourning for Chou, but during
the April Qingming Festival, the traditional time for Chinese to
honor their dead, there was a spontaneous outpouring of grief.
   On April 2, about 10,000 people marched to Tiananmen Square to
lay wreaths in honor of Chou, compose poems mourning his death and
make speeches with thinly veiled criticisms of Jiang Qing's group.
   The party ordered citizens to stay away from the square. The
response was defiance.
   On April 3, more than 100,000 congregated there, and the
monument to revolutionary heroes in the center of the plaza was
piled high with wreaths.
   The following night, authorities removed all the wreaths, and on
April 5 events turned violent. Angry crowds overturned a police van
and burned several cars and a police command post. The militia
attacked, beating with staves and dragging people off.
   Figures vary, but some witnesses say 100 were killed and 3,000
to 4,000 arrested.
   When Mao died five months later, military-led opponents of Jiang
Qing moved in quickly and overthrew the Gang of Four.
   Like Chou, Hu Yaobang was known as a man of the people. A victim
of the Cultural Revolution, he helped redress wrongs done during
that period.
   Hu also won the sympathy of students after he was ousted as
party chief in January 1987 for failing to deal harshly with
pro-democracy student demonstrations.
   After he died of a heart attack April 15, thousands trooped to
Tiananmen Square to lay wreaths, write poems, and give speeches
criticizing the nation's leaders.
   But Hu's popularity was limited mainly to intellectuals, unlike
Chou, who was beloved by all sectors of society. And discontent
with the pace of political reform today in no way compares to the
hatreds engendered by the Cultural Revolution's leadership.
   Although Hu is genuinely respected, there have not been the
tears and deep sense of personal loss there was for Chou.
   ``I don't think Hu was a savior for the country,'' said one
Beijing University student. ``But we needed something'' to spur
people into action, she said.
   Many students interviewed also acknowledged that unlike in 1976,
there is no broad-based support for their protests.
   Chou's death brought out factory workers, farmers, professionals
and people of all ages.
   Workers have listened with sympathy to the students, but few
have joined them in demonstrations.
   ``You can't eat democracy,' said one worker, who argued that
slowing the 36 percent inflation rate _ not instituting political
reforms _ should be the nation's main concern.
   And although police have kicked and hit a few students, they are
not likely to resort to such large-scale beatings as in 1976. The
government is more conscious of public and international opinion,
and students worried about their futures are unlikely to press too
far.
   Participants in the Tiananmen Incident of 1989 also know that
unlike their predecessors, they are not going to change the world.
   ``We've tried before to demonstrate for free speech and
failed,'' said one demonstrator. ``This time, too, the results will
not be good.''

   Alvin Glaze fell off the top of a
180-foot tower and lived to tell about it _ if he could just
remember.
   ``I don't remember a thing about the fall,'' said Glaze, head of
a tower maintenance crew for the state Office of Forestry. ``The
doctors say it might be psychological. It's just as good I don't
remember.''
   The 47-year-old Glaze suffered no broken bones, no internal
injuries.
   ``I got a bunch of deep cuts and bruises and the meat's tore
from my hands from grabbing those wires,'' he said Thursday from
his hospital bed.
   Glaze was dismantling a microwave tower from the old forestry
headquarters Tuesday when he fell from the top. Other workers said
the fall was cushioned because Glaze grabbed two different guy
wires which turned the fall into a wild slide.
   ``All I know is the chances of me thinking about grabbing any
wires are too great,'' Glaze said. ``I try to live by the Lord, and
I believe he did it for me.''
   Dale Singleton, who was 40 feet below Glaze, said Glaze dropped
10 feet to the first guy wire and slid along it for about 40 feet.
   At that point, Singleton said, Glaze reached out and grabbed a
second wire, hooked his leg over, and rode the wire to the ground.
   He said he couldn't believe his boss was alive on the ground.
   ``He sat up, looked at his hands and said, `I'm all right,'''
said Singleton.
   The triangular tower is supported by three sets of wires and
Glaze used the bottom two to break the fall.
   Glaze said as soon as he gets back to his Leesville home, ``I'm
going to hug my family and make some of my own coffee. I don't like
this instant coffee at the hospital.''
   And he'll climb again?
   ``I've got a strong will, and I'm the kind of person who'll
master it again,'' he said.

   Gag bottles of dirty Boston Harbor water haven't

collects the filthy stuff in large vats. She helps fill the little
bottles.
   Each bottle bears a label that promises the dirty water inside
is 100 percent proof but not for drinking. As an insurance measure,
the bottle caps are sealed with glue. They sell for $3 or $4.
   But Massport, which runs the airport, couldn't quite swallow the
idea. And since anything sold at the airport needs Massport's
approval, the bottles were ordered off the shelves last week.
   During his failed run for the White House last November, Gov.
Michael Dukakis took a beating from then-Vice President George Bush
for having the country's dirtiest harbor.
   Bush's advertising drowned out Dukakis' claim that he took the
lead in addressing centuries of harbor pollution by setting up the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority in 1984 to clean the harbor
waters.
   Luckily for the Kravetzes, they also bottle Cape Cod water,
which is cleaner, so they simply swapped merchandise, Mrs. Kravetz
said.
   ``I thought they could have at least taken a joke,'' Mrs.
Kravetz said Thursday.
   Said her husband, ``They have no sense of humor.''

<HEAD>Rat Hair, Insect Parts OK in Moderation, Government Says</HEAD>

   Insect parts, rodent hairs and maggots don't
sound appetizing, but when tossed with a salad, churned up in
tomato sauce or baked in bread they're not bad at all, the
government says.
   The Food and Drug Administration says that though vermin and
their residues are ``aesthetically unpleasing,'' within prescribed
limits they are ``harmless, natural and unavoidable'' in food.
   Under FDA standards, for example, 3.5 ounces of tomato sauce can
have up to 30 fly eggs, 11 ounces of wheat flour can have up to 450
insect fragments and a half pound of canned or frozen spinach can
have as many as 100 aphids, and a pound of cocoa beans can contain
up to 10 milligrams of rodent feces.
   These limits are in the FDA's manual of ``food defect action
levels.''
   According to the manual, the levels ``are set because it is not
possible, and never has been possible, to grow in open fields,
harvest and process crops that are totally free of natural
defects.''
   The alternative _ using more chemicals to control insects,
rodents and other natural contaminants _ ``is not satisfactory
because of the very real danger of exposing consumers to potential
hazards from residues of these chemicals,'' the agency says.
   In its manual, the FDA lists a range of products from apple
butter to nutmeg, from popcorn to pizza sauce. For each, it also
lists the level of allowed ``defect'' _ including insects, maggots,
rodent filth, fly eggs, mold, rot and mammalian excreta.
   ``During harvesting and processing, a great deal of this is
removed, but there could be a few pieces of insects or insect
bodies that get through,'' Paris Brickey, chief of the
microanalytical branch at the FDA, said Thursday.
   ``But these are not harmful to health,'' he said. ``The main
objection is aesthetics, but most would not notice it in the food
if it were there because most of it is microscopic.'' Also, some of
the foreign matter, like the field insects, will be washed off by
consumers before it is eaten, he said.
   If the FDA found a harmful pest or contaminant, like the
salmonella organism, the defect levels would not apply and the
agency would take the food off the market, he said.
   The agency uses its defect action levels to measure the sanitary
conditions of food manufacturers and processors, he said. If
contaminants are found in excess of the allowed levels, the FDA can
take legal action against the manufacturer and remove the product
from the market.
   ``Eating a fly wing may not hurt you, but it does indicate how
carefully the food has been prepared,'' said Rodney E. Leonard,
executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute, a
non-profit consumer interest group based in Washington, D.C.
   Leonard said it may be time for the FDA to review the standards,
``to go back and examine what quality do we expect and do these
standards reflect that. Some of these levels may be too high.
   ``There's more sensitivity today about food quality than at any
time since the 1960s when we last had a major review of food safety
legislation,'' he said. ``The problem with Chilean grapes and Alar
in apples indicates that the public is questioning the basis for a
lot of these standards.''

   Investigators aboard the USS Iowa searched for
clues to the cause of a fiery explosion that claimed the lives of
47 sailors as the damaged battleship headed home and grief-stricken
families dealt with the loss of their loved ones.
   Officials refused to speculate publicly on what caused the worst
disaster to strike a Navy ship in more than a decade, a blast that
ripped through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret during naval exercises
Wednesday in the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico.
   Although naval gunnery experts combed the vessel Thursday, their
task was complicated by the absence of survivors from the swiveling
gun housing where the explosion occurred. Eleven men escaped from
powder magazines located deep within the ship at the base of the
turret.
   ``We have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired,'' Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters as he returned to Washington
from a NATO meeting in Brussels.
   The Navy imposed a moratorium on firing 16-inch guns found on
the Iowa and its three sister battleships, the New Jersey, the
Wisconsin and the Missouri, pending an investigation of the
disaster.
   Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey,
began the board of inquiry's investigation, and Pentagon spokesman
Fred Hoffman said he could not predict when the investigation would
be completed.
   As the Iowa headed toward its home port in Norfolk, Va., the
flag-draped, metal coffins containing the bodies of the 47 seamen
killed arrived at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, site of the
largest military mortuary. Navy honor guards carried the coffins
off a camouflaged C-5 Galaxy cargo plane.
   The bodies had been airlifted by helicopter from the Iowa while
it was anchored offshore from Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in
Puerto Rico, and placed on the cargo plane for the flight home.
   Across the nation, teams of Navy officers and chaplains broke
the news to the sailors' next of kin.
   ``It's the greatest tragedy any of us can suffer,'' said Rear
Adm. Jimmy Pappas, the base commander in Norfolk. ``It's the most
difficult thing you have to do'' to tell someone that a loved one
has been killed.
   Ernest Hanyecz Sr., of Bordentown, N.J., stayed up all night
trying to get information about his 27-year-old son Ernest before
learning Thursday that he was among those killed.
   ``As long as they play their war games, there will be more
deaths and innocent people will die,'' said Hanyecz, whose son
joined the Navy at the age of 17.
   The dead included one officer, Lt. j.g. Phillip Edward Buch, 24,
of Las Cruces, N.M., and 46 enlisted men. Most victims were single
and from 18 to 22 years old, said Navy officials. A memorial
service will be held Monday on the Norfolk base.
   Adm. Jerome Johnson, the commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet who was
aboard the Iowa, said ``the fire and explosion was instantaneous.''
   Navy officials aboard the Iowa had scheduled firing 22 rounds.
Four rounds were fired from the No. 1 turret and immediately after
the commander had given the order to load and prepare the gun in
the No. 2 turret, the explosion occurred.
   Capt. Larry Seaquist, a former captain of the Iowa, told
reporters earlier in the day, ``It seems from the reports that
those powders exploded.'' Six 110-pound sacks of powder are rammed
into each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-pound shell.
   Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion can
occur if a gun breech is cracked, but Seaquist stressed, ``we
simply do not know what caused that powder to go.''
   None of the four battleships of the Iowa class, which saw
service in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, had
previously experienced such an explosion, Pentagon officials said.
   Wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for the
Navy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died when
a launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton was
struck by a Spanish freighter.
   Except for two World War II Japanese battleships and the current
Navy aircraft carriers, the 58,000-ton ships of the Iowa class are
the largest warships in the world.

   A prosecutor said Ramon Salcido was
deported at his own request Thursday, rendering moot the debate
over whether the admitted mass slayer would be forced to leave
Mexico to face trial in California.
   Salcido, accused of killing his wife, two young daughters and
four other people, left Mexico City aboard the private plane of
famed cartoonist Charles Schulz, a Santa Rosa resident who had
supplied the jet to Sonoma County authorities.
   Salcido landed in San Diego and would reboard the plane to
continue on to Sonoma County after clearing customs and immigration
checks, officials said.
   U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said he was told Salcido had
asked to be returned to the United States.
   ``Apparently he requested voluntary departure,'' Russoniello
told reporters here. ``Mexican authorities did nothing to interfere
with that request. He confirmed with them that he's for all intents
and purposes an American subject.''
   Russoniello said he was aware of no assurances given to Salcido
that he would not face the death penalty. Some officials had
speculated that Mexico would put up an extradition fight because
that country has no death penalty.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp had already begun
extradition proceedings when Salcido was deported.
   But Peter Keane, a professor of criminal procedure at Hastings
School of Law in San Francisco, said Mexican officials may have
thought the charges ``so reprehensible'' that they had very little
sympathy for Salcido.
   The U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty is a ``mutual-type agreement
between the two countries, but we have no enforcement power over
it,'' Keane said.
   Mexican officers reported arresting Salcido on Wednesday in a
roadblock set up to snare drug traffickers. The winery worker has
admitted killing seven people in a rampage through Sonoma County on
Friday.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said Salcido had
not filed naturalization papers and was still a Mexican citizen,
but Mexican authorities said Salcido claimed to be a U.S. citizen.

   Hooded gunmen killed an American
military officer and Vietnam War hero Friday as he was driving to
work at the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group headquarters, U.S.
and Filipino officials said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel said Army Col. James N.
Rowe, 51, of McAllen, Texas, was pronounced dead on arrival at a
Philippine military hospital, and his body was flown to Clark Air
Base, 50 miles north of Manila.
   While no group claimed responsibility, a senior Filipino officer
said investigators believed the killers were Communist rebels.
   Rowe, who was shot in the head, was held prisoner by the Viet
Cong from 1963 until he escaped in 1968. He wrote a book about the
ordeal entitled ``Five Years to Freedom.''
   Friends of Rowe's in the U.S. diplomatic community said he was
to have addressed the U.S. Embassy's women's club on Wednesday
about his experiences in Vietnam. He is survived by a wife and two
young children, the friends said on condition of anonymity.
   Col. Victor Tiangco of the Philippine military's Capital Region
Command said Rowe was chief of the army division at the Joint U.S.
Military Advisory Group, which provides training and logistical
support for the Filipino army.
   He said Rowe's Filipino chauffeur, Joaquin Vinuya, was wounded
in the shooting but was reported out of danger.
   Tiangco said assailants wearing hoods opened fire with M-16
rifles as Rowe's car approached the group compound in suburban
Quezon City about 7:10 a.m. Tiangco said 21 bullets struck the car.
   Police said at least three people were in the assailants' car,
at least two of whom were gunmen and one a driver. One gunman had
an M-16 and another had a .45 caliber pistol, they said.
   Tiangco said the assailants sped away. Witnesses said Rowe's car
was able to reach the compound, about two blocks from the shooting.
   Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy chief of the National Capital Region
Defense Command, said Communist rebels were suspected because of
the weapons and style of the attack. Oxales said Rowe was struck in
the head.
   Oxales said the preliminary investigation indicated three cars
may have been used in the attack, although most witnesses said they
saw gunmen firing from only one.
   Toto Austria, a cashier at a gasoline station, said he heard
shots and turned to see a white car pull alongside Rowe's
silver-gray vehicle with tinted windows.
   As the cars turned right along a traffic circle, Austria said he
saw one M-16 rifle extending from the window and firing at the
other vehicle. He said Rowe's car turned toward the military
compound and the assailants followed, continuing to fire.
   The assailants' car then made a U-turn and sped away.
   There was no indication as to who staged the attack or why.
   In October 1987, communist rebels killed three Americans and a
Filipino of U.S. descent in simultaneous attacks near Clark Air
Base.
   The rebels have threatened more attacks against Americans
because of U.S. support for President Corazon Aquino's
counterinsurgency campaign. U.S. officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said any future attacks would probably be directed
against soldiers assigned to the advisory group.
   On April 9, rebels blasted a U.S. military communications in
Benguet province. No one was injured, but U.S. officials asked that
security around American installations be tightened.
   Rowe's book, published in 1971, details the disease and
psychological and physical torment he endured as a Viet Cong
prisoner.
   After his release, he was chief of the Army's Survival, Evasion,
Resistance and Escape Training, which also included training in
anti-terrorism techniques, based in North Carolina.

<HEAD>Hunts Came Within Weeks of Cornering the Silver Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The multimillionaire Hunt brothers of Texas
came within weeks of cornering the world silver market, according
to a previously secret government document, but the Hunts say they
were only following a family tradition of thinking _ and buying _
big.
   Filings in the government's price-fixing case against Nelson
Bunker and William Herbert Hunt show that government investigators
believe they were close to establishing a world silver monopoly in
1980.
   The brothers, in their response, say the silver shopping spree
was nothing out of the ordinary for the sons of legendary Texas
oilman H.L. Hunt.
   The government and defense documents, which had been under court
seal, were obtained by The Associated Press this week through a
Freedom of Information Act request.
   ``H.L. Hunt was a wildcatter,'' the brothers' lawyers say in
their response. ``He raised his sons with a wildcatter's
philosophy, which involved risk-taking and rapid decision making.
When the Hunts enter a field of investment, they typically do so on
a relatively large scale in light of their substantial wealth.''
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission contends that the
brothers actually were engaged in a price-fixing scheme.
   In a previously sealed submission by the CFTC to an
administrative law judge, the agency contends that had the scheme
not collapsed, ``by the end of May 1980, they could have owned
virtually the entire available world supply of deliverable .999
silver bullion.''
   Attorneys for the Hunts counter that their silver investments
stemmed simply from their preference for investing in hard assets
as a hedge against inflation and monetary uncertainty.
   And they said such large purchases were in keeping with the
brothers' approach to business.
   At the time of the 1987 filing, Hunt attorneys said, Bunker
owned a forest in Florida, the largest tract of land in northern
Australia, a quarter of million square feet of building property in
downtown Anchorage and the biggest piece of waterfront property in
San Diego. He was one of the largest cattle raisers in the country,
and owned the largest Arab coin collection in the world.
   Their oil holdings ``of course, are very substantial,'' the
lawyers said, and include interests in ``many of the richest fields
discovered to date.''
   Many documents in the case had been sealed from the public view
since 1985 at the Hunts' request; the stack is now more than 5 feet
tall. The filings in the quasi-judicial proceeding were released by
the agency this week in response to the AP request.
   The CFTC has accused the brothers, heirs to one of the world's
greatest fortunes, of rigging the price of silver futures between
fall 1979 and March 27, 1980. That day came to be known as ``Silver
Thursday'' as prices crashed to $10 an ounce from a one-time high
of more than $50 an ounce.
   Thousands of investors, who had purchased silver on credit, lost
billions of dollars when they were forced to sell it to pay their
debts. The Hunts themselves lost an estimated $1.3 billion.
   ``The prices for silver bullion and futures during that period
rose to their highest levels of the century and then fell even more
quickly than they had risen. Only the (Hunts') silver-buying frenzy
... accounts for the magnitude of the price rise,'' said a CFTC
document.
   It is the largest market manipulation case ever filed by the
CFTC and if the Hunts lose, they could be permanently banned from
trading in all futures markets and fined $100,000 for each
violation of federal commodity laws.
   The brothers' response to the charges offers a glimpse into
jet-setting life on the international horse-racing circuit from
Kentucky to France, of banking in Zurich, and of courting Arab
investors.
   The CFTC says it has evidence of a ``tangled web'' of
relationships and rendezvous at luxurious locales to support
charges the men schemed to corner the silver market. The agency
alleges the Hunts recruited Saudi Arabian sheiks Ali Bin Mussalam
and Mohammed Aboud Al-Amoudi, and Brazilian speculator Naji Robert
Nahas to join their effort.
   ``These horse-related meetings amount to zero proof of
conspiracy or manipulative intent,'' the Hunts responded. ``There
is not a scrap of evidence that these meetings resulted in any
joint conduct _ or even parallel transactions _ with respect to
silver.''
   Since the 1987 filing, the brothers have filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization. They face several Internal Revenue
Service claims totaling many millions of dollars, and Bunker Hunt
was forced to sell his beloved breeding and racing stock of horses
because of setbacks in the oil industry.
   They and others also have been ordered by a jury in New York to
pay $136.4 million to Minpeco S.A., the Peruvian government's
silver mining company, for ruined investments because of the silver
price collapse.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Castro's Man in Washington Going Home After 12
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He is perhaps the longest serving chief of
diplomatic mission in Washington but his name has been
conspicuously absent from State Department invitation lists for
years.
   He came here in the summer of 1977 with high hopes for a more
congenial relationship between his government and the United States
but is going home in a few days with the atmosphere worse now than
when he arrived.
   For Ramon Sanchez Parodi, being Fidel Castro's agent in
Washington has not been an easy task.
   Much of his tenure has overlapped with the era of conservative
Republican dominance in Washington, a time when kind words for
Castro have been as rare as frost in Havana in July.
   But Sanchez Parodi has acquired a reputation here as a no
apologies defender of his country's leader and its revolution.
   For starters, don't try to convince him about the merits of
``Western values.'' He told a gathering at a local university the
other day that to Cuba, ``Western values'' means centuries of
Spanish colonial rule, decades of American neo-colonial rule and a
capitalist system that left millions of Cubans in misery.
   ``We don't want to have anything to do with these values,'' he
said, his mastery of English reflecting his long stay here.
   He believes the strain in relations with the United States has
damaged American interests. Cuba could help the United States curb
drug trafficking and environmental pollution but Washington has
been unwilling to enlist Cuba's cooperation, he said.
   The absence of a more normal relationship, he said, is the
result of Washington's refusal to accept Cuba ``as a sovereign and
independent nation.''
   Sanchez Parodi assumed his duties here on Sept. 1, 1977, ending
a 16-year period in which diplomatic contact between the United
States and Cuba was a rarity.
   When he arrived to open a small Cuban diplomatic mission here,
there were champagne toasts. The Carter administration was young
and was giving high priority to promoting a more normal
relationship with Cuba.
   Sanchez Parodi thought that full diplomatic relations could be
restored in two or three years.
   But one setback followed another. President Carter's national
security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was never enthusiastic about
detente with Castro, and he worked behind the scenes to head off
that possibility, according to officials familiar with that period.
   There were myriad other irritants during the Carter years: the
dispatch of Cuban troops to Ethiopia, a flap over a Soviet military
brigade in Cuba, and the arrival in Florida of more than 125,000
Cubans _ including many who were criminals or mentally ill _ aboard
the Mariel boat lift in 1980.
   With the advent of the Reagan administration, Sanchez Parodi
acquired almost pariah status, a reflection of the view of
then-Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. that Cuba was
responsible for leftist turmoil in Central America.
   There was a time at the end of 1981 that Sanchez Parodi feared
an American invasion of Cuba. That concern didn't materialize but
the administration in other ways tried to make life for Castro as
difficult as possible.
   It tightened the U.S. embargo against Cuba, forbade American
tourists from going there and encouraged allied countries _ with
some success _ to limit their dealings with Cuba.
   There was the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada, Cuba's main
supporter in the Caribbean, and the introduction of Radio Marti,
the VOA broadcast operation tailored for Cuban listeners.
   There were U.S. spy flights over Cuba and an intensive U.S.
campaign to call United Nations attention to alleged human rights
violations in Cuba. For a time, the U.S. representative in Cuba was
as much a social outcast in Havana as Sanchez Parodi was in
Washington.
   Even the arrival of a moderately less ideological administration
in Washington three months ago has not produced a breather in
relations.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III saw to that by sending
diplomatic posts a memo last month asserting that an improvement in
relations with Cuba is not possible until Cuba ends its
``unacceptable behavior.''
   Now Sanchez Parodi is returning to Havana, having been promoted
to the post of vice foreign minister. Once installed there, he may
have a hand in shaping Cuba's response to Washington's latest
proposed innovation for the island _ a television version of Radio
Marti.

   Three black nationalist guerrillas were
killed in a battle with South African-controlled forces in northern
Namibia in the first fighting reported this week, a territorial
official said Friday.
   Gerhard Roux, chief aide to Namibia Administrator-General Louis
Pienaar, gave the death toll for the Thursday afternoon battle
before flying north Friday on what he said was a routine trip.
   He said he had no more information about the clash.
   Col. Richard Warren, commander of Australian U.N. military
forces in northern Namibia, said the battle was reported to be
serious. He said it took place three to five miles from Okankolo,
which lies about 30 miles southeast of Ondangwa airbase, where Roux
was headed.
   Martti Ahtisaari, the special U.N. representative for Namibia,
was informed of the fighting, sources said.
   The United Nations forces in Namibia have set up assembly points
in the north for the guerrillas to report to and be transported
back across the border to Angola.
   But according to police and military reports, most of the
guerrillas who have left crossed the border on their own rather
than report to the assembly points or to church premises, which
also have been declared safe havens.
   The incursion by several hundred guerrillas from the South-West
African People's Organization, or SWAPO, across the border from
Angola on April 1 interrupted the implementation of a U.N. peace
plan intended to lead to independence elections in November.
   South Africa, which has ruled the territory for 74 years, had
agreed to the plan, which called for the orderly, unarmed return of
the guerrillas in mid-May from their bases in Angola and Tanzania.
   SWAPO guerrillas have been fighting since 1966 to end South
African control of the territory, which is also called South-West
Africa.
   In another development, a U.N. official said Thursday the United
Nations has completed an investigation into allegations of police
intimidation at a mission station in northern Namibia and has asked
the South African-appointed administrator of the territory to take
action.
   U.N. official Cedric Thornberry said the report by the U.N.
police commissioner, Steven Fanning, would not be made public.
   Residents of the area around Oshikuku, where some SWAPO
guerrillas had assembled for transport to Angola, had told church
officials and reporters that police threatened and harassed them in
an attempt to make them give information about guerrillas in the
area.

<HEAD>New Rules Should Bring Expanded Efforts to Organize Hospital Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   New rules for organizing hospital workers
appear to give unions a better chance of recruiting some of the
estimated 6 million non-union workers in one of the fastest growing
sectors of the economy.
   The rules issued Thursday by the National Labor Relations Board
also appear likely to intensify the already heated competition
between two major unions seeking to establish themselves as the
leader in the health-care sector, union officials say.
   Those unions, the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees and the Service Employees International Union,
represent about 300,000 health care workers each and are competing
to win the affiliation of the 75,000-member National Union of
Hospital and Health Care Employees, whose members decide the issue
next month.
   The NLRB rules, published in today's Federal Register, create
eight categories of hospital employees, distinctions that will
prohibit hospitals from lumping together in prospective bargaining
units workers with widely varying tasks, such as nurses and
janitors.
   Unions contend hospitals have used such tactics to stymie
organizing efforts. Now, if a union can win an election among
workers in any one category the hospital would have to recognize it
as the collective bargaining agent for that group.
   The hospital industry, which has opposed the new rules
throughout the rulemaking procedure, said it planned to challenge
them in court on grounds they violate 1974 legislation designed to
prevent ``undue proliferation'' of bargaining units within the
health care industry.
   ``What we see occurring are stepped-up efforts to place hospital
employees in these numerous bargaining units,'' said Michael
Anthony, executive vice president of the American Hospital
Association. ``We see that resulting in a myriad of different
benefit packages, contracts with varying termination dates, the
potential for work stoppages and a number of negotiations that
might be ongoing at a given time. It all adds up to additional
costs being incurred by the hospitals.''
   The unions, not surprisingly, offered different interpretations.
   ``The ruling sends a clear signal to hospitals to accept the
fact that health care workers want to organize,'' said AFSCME
President Gerald W. McEntee.
   ``We see it as a major victory for health care workers,'' said
SEIU attorney Jonathan Hiatt. ``These rules should finally provide
a real opportunity for those health care workers who wish to
organize to gain a voice.''
   Hiatt said the ruling raised the stakes in next month's
affiliation election because the winner could be viewed as the
premier health-care union.
   ``I have no question that there are other unions out there who
are interested in organizing this industry,'' he said without
referring to AFSCME.
   AFSCME is the larger of the unions, with 1.2 million members as
opposed to SEIU's 850,000.
   The regulations are little changed from proposed rules issued in
September. The NLRB said it believed its decision to recognize
eight categories met the congressional mandate.
   Congress, in adopting that provision, said that health care
could be unduly disrupted if hospital management had to deal with
too many unions, such as the dozen or more unions sometimes found
in construction and other industries.
   The rules effectively reverse a 1984 NLRB decision allowing only
three or four bargaining units at hospitals. Since that decision
the number of hospital workers nationwide who belong to unions
dropped from 23 percent to 19 percent, according to union figures.
Disputes over the structure of prospective bargaining units led to
dozens of NLRB and court cases.
   The eight categories listed in the final rules are: physicians;
registered nurses; all professionals except physicians and
registered nurses; technical employees such as lab workers; skilled
maintenance workers; business office clerical workers; guards; and
all other non-professional employees.
   The rules apply to acute care hospitals. Exempt are nursing
homes, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals and other
health care facilities. Units of five or fewer employees also would
be exempt from the rules.

<HEAD>Senators Looking Into Airline Competition, Air Fares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee is taking a look at the
impact of 10 years of airline deregulation on fares and competition.
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee sent
letters Thursday to Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh raising several questions about
the decreasing number of airlines and the increasing cost of
airplane tickets.
   ``In my view, economic concentration and monopoly power are at
the heart of the problem,'' said Sen. John C. Danforth of Missouri,
ranking Republican on the committee. The letters were signed by
Danforth, Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and Sens.
Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and John McCain, R-Ariz., both leaders of the
aviation subcommittee.
   The senators said that while 215 airlines were created over the
last decade, only 59 still exist and eight carriers now control 94
percent of the U.S. air travel market.
   The committee also has asked the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, to analyze the impact of decreased
competition in its study of fares at 15 large and small hubs around
the country, a congressional source said. The committee plans to
hold a hearing on airline competition next month.
   The letters to Skinner and Thornburgh raise strong concerns
about performance of the aviation industry since deregulation in
1978.
   The inquiry follows a Transportation Department study in January
that showed air fares have increased substantially since 1985 at a
half dozen airports dominated by a single airline. The study showed
above-average increases at St. Louis; Charlotte, N.C.; Cincinnati;
Detroit; Minneapolis; Raleigh, N.C.; and Salt Lake City.
   The senators asked Skinner to say whether he considers the
concentration consistent with the goals of deregulation, whether it
can be reversed and whether he supports the purchase of interest in
U.S. airlines by foreign carriers.
   They also asked several questions about the apparent link
between high fares and increasing single-airline domination of hub
airports, about the effects of deregulation on service to smaller
communities, about airline profits, and about other matters
affecting competition.
   The senators asked Thornburgh if the Justice Department believes
action should be taken to encourage more competition, particularly
at hub airports.
   Questions for Thornburgh cover department policy on the
application of antitrust laws to airlines, on international mergers
involving U.S. airlines, on airline control over hub airports, on
long-term leases of gates and other airport facilities, on sharing
arrangements between major airlines and regional carriers, and on
department authority to challenges ``predatory pricing'' and
``discriminatory pricing'' by airlines.

   Through good years and bad years, Cleveland
Indians' baseball fans have always had one thing they could count
on _ Cleveland Stadium's Famous Bertman Ball Park Mustard _ until
now.
   The Indians cut the mustard from the menu this spring, prompting
dismay from fans who have been defying chilly breezes off Lake Erie
to see the home team.
   ``I've been away from this town for 15 years and lived all over
the U.S., and I've told everybody that the best mustard in the U.S.
is in Cleveland,'' said Lee Snyder, 43, of Columbus. ``And now,
they tell me it's not the same mustard. It's like taking the brats
(bratwurst) out of Milwaukee.''
   But stomach grumbles apparently outweigh discontent.
   Laverne Schmotzer, general manager for Service America, the
concessionaire at the stadium, say fans this year have been eating
about 1{ hot dogs apiece per game, the same as usual.
   Attending an Indians game or Cleveland Browns football contest
and munching a hot dog topped with the tangy Bertman mustard has
been a tradition since Joe Bertman introduced the brown mustard at
ballgames in 1950.
   But when bids came in this February, Bertman's price was $2 more
per case than its Cleveland competitor, Authentic Stadium Mustard,
Ms. Schmotzer said. She said she decided to switch to Authentic
Stadium Mustard after tasters from the Indians' and Browns' staffs
said they couldn't tell the difference between the two mustards.
   ``There has been a feud between the two companies and every
year, they both say they have the best mustard,'' Ms. Schmotzer
said. ``The taste was so similar, we decided to go with a better
price.''
   But at least some of the fans attending Wednesday's game with
the Boston Red Sox think tradition is more important than money.
   Others said you have to pay for good taste.
   ``It's a little different but the taste is basically the same,''
Mike McGonega, 40, of suburban Bay Village said while eating a hot
dog. ``What makes everybody mad is that it was based on price. They
broke a tradition without asking anybody. Normally, I'm not an
opinionated guy, but on this, you've got to dig your heels in.''
   Larry Hammond, 33, of Jackson, Mich., said: ``I used to buy this
stuff by the jar. I don't know if I will after tasting this. It
tastes diluted. It's not as tangy.''
   Pat Bertman Mazoh, Joe Bertman's daughter, took over the mustard
and food distribution business after her father died. She says the
recent mustard switch at the stadium is just another skirmish in
``mustard wars'' with David Dwoskin, president of the Davis Food
Co. which distributes Authentic Stadium Mustard.
   In 1968, Dwoskin and Joe Bertman agreed that Dwoskin would sell
Bertman's Mustard to retailers and the mustard became available in
jars to shoppers.
   ``Bertman and I had a deal where he would continue selling the
mustard at the stadium. We were both buying the same mustard from a
Chicago plant,'' Dwoskin said.
   ``Up until 1982, we were Stadium Mustard,'' Mrs. Mazoh said.
``Then my father dreamed up `Ball Park' mustard.''
   Stadium Mustard is made in Chicago, while Bertman's is made in
southern Ohio, the mustard distributors said.
   Margaret Engel, co-author of ``Food Finds: America's Best Local
Foods and The People Who Produce Them,'' said Bertman's mustard was
included in their 1984 book, but a new edition of the book may
include both brands.
   ``No matter which company was selected, Cleveland is to be
commended for having two great mustards,'' Ms. Engel said from her
Bethesda, Md., home. ``Cleveland has always had mustard 10 levels
above other stadiums. Most ballparks have that horrible,
institutional, bright yellow tasteless glop.''

   The financial industry was the leader of 19
categories of special interest groups that paid honoraria to
senators from 1984 to 1987, a new study says.
   And eight of the top 10 Senate recipients of the money held
positions on committees that voted on issues affecting that
industry, according to report released Thursday by Public Citizen.
   The financial interests spent $1.3 million in honoraria during
1984-87, followed by the food and beverage industry, which spent
$1.1 million. The next group, educational institutions, paid more
than $663,000.
   Recipients of honoraria served on committees able to help the
giver. All the top 10 recipients of honoraria from the food
industry were on committees that voted on food issues.
   All together, senators received $9.5 million during the years
studied and kept $7.3 million, the difference going to charity so
members could comply with the Senate limits on honoraria.
   Republican senators received an average of $27,881 each year
compared with $22,005 for Democrats, the study said.
   Other contributors of honoraria were the health,
telecommunications, and transportation industries; builders and
developers; the energy and insurance industries; business advocacy
groups; the defense industry; ideological groups; law firms;
religious organizations; advertising firms; the computer and
chemical industries; utility companies; and publications that
bought articles.
   Public Citizen, which describes itself as a national consumer
and environmental advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader,
entitled its honoraria report ``Who Pays The Piper.''
   Honoraria consist of payments for speeches, appearances and
articles. Senate rules allow senators to keep up to 40 percent of
their $89,500 salary _ or $35,800 in honoraria a year _ with the
rest given to charity.
   House members can keep honoraria totaling 30 percent of their
salary, or $26,850 annually. Payments to lawmakers in both houses
cannot exceed $2,000 for an individual speech or appearance.
   Lawmakers appeared willing earlier this year to do away with
honoraria in return for a pay raise that would at least offset the
loss. This supplemental income was left untouched, however, when
the pay raise collapsed under intense public pressure.
   The system is now under review by a special committee headed by
Reps. Vic Fazio, D-Calif. and Lynn Martin, R-Ill., and no action is
expected anytime soon.
   In unveiling new ethics proposals April 12, President Bush made
no recommendation on congressional honoraria, saying he wanted to
take it up at a future time in connection with a congressional pay
raise.''
   The report said Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., received the most
honoraria during the four-year period, totaling $308,934. Following
were Sens. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., with $266,685; Orrin G. Hatch
with $259,440; Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. with $254,849; and
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. with $235,894.
   Eleven senators in office during the four-year period did not
accept honoraria: Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.;
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; Bob Graham, D-Fla.;
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; Russell Long, D-La.;
Harry Reid, D-Nev.; Terry Sanford, D-N.C.; and John Stennis, D-Miss.

<HEAD>Farmland Values Head Upward Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improved prospects for the nation's
agriculture have helped boost the value of farmland, but
Agriculture Department economists say the heady price levels of the
early 1980s are as yet but a dream.
   The department's Economic Research Service said Thursday that as
of Feb. 1 the average value of U.S. farmland, including buildings,
was $597 per acre, up 6 percent from about $564 on Feb. 1, 1988.
   It was the second consecutive annual increase. Farmland prices
sank to a 19-year low of $548 per acre on Feb. 1, 1987, before
gaining 3 percent last year.
   ``However, the 1989 value was still 27 percent below the record
$823 in 1982,'' the report said.
   Several factors were cited for the gain in farmland prices. Net
cash income of farmers in 1988 nearly matched the 1987 record, and
that buoyed confidence among prospective buyers that the
agricultural sector was working its way out of the crunch that
weighed on many farmers.
   Although producers hit by the 1988 drought experienced lower
crop yields, many grain producers, particularly those with
irrigation and those holding grain stocks from previous harvests,
benefited from sharply higher market prices, the report said.
   Federal drought aid also boosted farm receipts in 1988 and
helped blunt the short-term impact. Higher cattle prices ``helped
expand cash receipts from livestock to record levels'' last year,
the report said.
   ``Values rose in all farm production regions except the Southern
Plains,'' the report said. ``Substantial gains in Pennsylvania,
Delaware and New Jersey led the 13 percent average (increase) in
the Northeast.''
   Although state average farmland prices were not immediately
available, the report said substantial gains also occurred in the
Corn Belt, up 10 percent, and the Northern Plains, 9 percent.
Further ``significantly higher'' values were reported in Iowa and
Nebraska.
   Land value increases in the Lake States, up 5 percent, and the
Southeast, up 7 percent, were said to be ``comparable to last
year,'' while a 6 percent increase in Appalachia was sharply higher
than the year before. A 3 percent increase in the value of farmland
in the Delta States was the first since 1981.
   ``Higher values in the Pacific region, 5 percent, and the
Mountain region, 1 percent, represented the first increases since
1984,'' the report said. ``The 5 percent drop in Texas more than
offset the 9 percent gain in Oklahoma, leading to an overall 2
percent decline for the Southern Plains.''

   The Agriculture Department says it is making
progress in writing new federal regulations on making old-fashioned
country hams, a rule-making procedure that began more than six
years ago.
   But a final decision could take until the end of this year and
maybe longer, if the USDA's long history of delays is taken into
account.
   The country ham issue began in March 1983 when the department
initially proposed new safety rules for commercial processors. But
industry challenges, USDA tinkering and other hurdles kept pushing
back the rule-making deadline, which is currently Dec. 31, 1989.
   Country hams are most commonly found in cloth bags in
supermarkets and country stores, preserved by salt, smoke and air
for months and even years. They must be scraped, soaked and cooked
before being eaten.
   Most hams in supermarket meat counters are wet-cured quickly in
brine solutions and cooked before sale to consumers.
   In its latest move announced Thursday, the USDA proposes ``to
allow certain amounts of potassium chloride as an alternative to
salt'' in the curing of country hams to kill trichinae, microscopic
parasitic worms. If improperly cooked and eaten, infested meat can
cause a disease called trichinosis in humans.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said federal regulations currently
allow three curing methods for destroying trinchinae in ham. The
proposal modifies two of the methods and provides and additional
method.
   Crawford said the proposed new method would allow processors to
substitute potassium chloride for some of the sodium chloride _
salt _ in the curing mixture. Current rules call for a 4 percent
salt content to ensure safety of the ham.
   But research by North Carolina State University shows that some
substitution of potassium chloride can be allowed without
compromising safety, he said. A minimum salt content in the cure
mixture would be required, but up to half the weight could consist
of potassium chloride.
   The proposal also would eliminate the current ``method No. 2''
for destroying trichinae, which involves injecting a salt water
solution into the ham. Crawford said his agency believes this
method is no longer being used commercially.
   Public comments on the country ham proposal can be sent through
June 19 to: Policy Office, Attn: Linda Carey, FSIS Hearing Clerk,
Room 3171-S, FSIS, USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's Puzzled by Complaints About Iran-Contra Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is voicing bewilderment over
claims that sensitive Iran-Contra documents _ including some
dealing with his own actions _ were withheld from congressional
investigators.
   But Bush does say emphatically that the Reagan White House, not
his, was responsible for providing documents to the committees
during their investigations in 1987.
   If the lawmakers now have a complaint about what was and was not
made available, he said, they should contact A.B. Culvahouse, who
was Reagan's White House counsel at the time.
   ``All I can just state is the confidence that I feel in
Culvahouse and company,'' he said Thursday.
   Bush also insisted anew that he would not discuss a document
showing that he served as an intermediary in getting Honduras to
help the Nicaraguan Contras. This came during a time when U.S.
military aid to the rebels was banned.
   ``I might have something to say on it'' after the completion of
the trial of former Reagan White House aide Oliver North, who is
accused of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional
investigation, among other charges.
   ``I went to Honduras, sure. That's a matter of public record,''
he said during the 22-minute question-and-answer session on the
Colonnade next to the Rose Garden.
   ``Put it this way: my conscience is clear.''
   On other matters, Bush:
   _Said he has not made any decision on new restrictions against
semiautomatic weapons. Likewise, he said he has not made a decision
about how to modernize the strategic nuclear arsenal or funding
levels for the Star Wars missile defense program.
   _Declared that selective drug testing for federal employees ``is
very important, and nobody will change my mind on that one.'' But
he sidestepped questions about whether he agreed with Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh's suggestion in a Baltimore Sun interview
that drug testing for public housing applicants ``ought to be
considered.''
   _Said he wished there was ``some dramatic plan'' that could win
agreement to stop the violence in Lebanon. ``The problem _ the
short-run of it _ how you stop this firing, the shelling, how you
get factions to stop warring _ has certainly in recent times defied
solution. But we can't give up on it.''
   The session with the small group of reporters was dominated by
questions about the Iran-Contra documents which have surfaced for
the first time during North's trial.
   Bush said he would ``offer full cooperation to any request made
of this administration'' for information. However, he said
documents from the Reagan White House were in ``the control and
custody'' of the Federal Archives.
   ``I have no reason to believe that the previous administration,
the lawyers in it who worked closely with Congress, did not fulfill
their obligation,'' Bush said.
   Asked if he would cooperate in a congressional request for an
immediate and thorough investigation of whether documents had been
withheld from lawmakers, Bush said, ``I would refer them to the
people that were in charge of the documentation, which could be Mr.
Culvahouse and company, in whom I have great confidence. But if
there's anything we can do to encourage that _ absolutely.''
   A White House spokesman, asked about the president's promise of
cooperation, said he did not know specifically what the pledge
might mean.
   As for his own role in the Iran-Contra affair, Bush said, ``I'm
not discussing anything about my role in this except to say that
everything I've said (in the past), I'll stand behind.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Iran-Contra
documents from the Reagan administration had been in the control of
the FBI and independent counsel and now were being handled by the
Archives.
   He said the Bush White House did not have ``direct control''
over the material. Asked what Bush could do to carry out his
promise for ``full cooperation,'' Fitzwater said, ``I don't know.''
   But he said the White House had no intention of looking into the
documents. ``The White House has never investigated itself. and
we're not going to start now. We have no role in this.''

<HEAD>Cheney Has List of Expected Cuts from Defense Budget</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney wants to cut the
Midgetman missile, attack submarines, new fighter jets, troop
transport planes and some funding for Star Wars from the 1990
budget, congressional sources say.
   Warren Nelson, an aide to the House Armed Services Committee,
said Thursday the cuts are in a draft report Cheney sent to the
military branches, but he warned the recommendations could change
in the final report.
   Cheney is making adjustments to the 1990 budget submitted by
former President Reagan in order to meet the goals of a budget
compromise worked out a week ago between the White House and
Congress. The agreement calls for spending $299.2 billion on
defense, which requires trimming $10 billion from the budget Reagan
submitted.
   Cheney is expected to present a package of cuts to Congress next
week.
   Nelson said Cheney's draft report called for the elimination of
funding for new F-14D Tomcat fighter jets, the V-22 Osprey troop
transport aircraft and the Midgetman missile as well as the last of
two submarines in the Los Angeles class.
   In addition, the preliminary report recommended slicing in half
funding for F-18 fighters, stretching out the purchasing plan for
the B-2 bomber, cutting funds for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
reducing various helicopter programs and decommissioning an
aircraft carrier.
   Rep. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., said Cheney has ``kicked
upstairs'' to the White House decisions on what he described as the
most controversial cutback recommendations _ the F-14, the Los
Angeles class subs, Midgetman and the SDI reductions.
   ``Right now, the ball is in the White House court,''
Hochbrueckner said. He declined to reveal the source of his
information.
   The planned elimination of the two attack submarines already
spurred lobbying by lawmakers from the Eastern Seaboard. The subs
are made at the Electric Boat shipyard in Connecticut.
   Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., a former Navy secretary, on
Thursday wrote a letter to Cheney that criticized any move to
eliminate the sub funding as ``short sighted in terms of our
national security requirements.''
   Chafee pointed to a recent independent report ordered by the
House Armed Services Committee that detailed major advances in
Soviet submarine technology.
   ``I hope you will agree that it would be a serious mistake for
the United States to curtail the SSN-688 program at this time,'' he
said.
   Congressional aides said the submarines were vulnerable to the
budget ax because they were scheduled to be the last two of the Los
Angeles class series. The Los Angeles series will be replaced by
the SSN-21 Seawolfs.

<HEAD>Doctors And Nurses Confused About Concept Of Brain Death, Study Finds</HEAD>

   Confusion among doctors about the legal and
medical definition of ``brain dead'' is common and may deprive some
people of life-saving organ transplants, doctors say.
   ``Health professionals have personal concepts of death that vary
widely and are often confused and or self-contradictory,''
according to authors of a study, led by Dr. Stuart J. Youngner of
Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.
   But the findings should not be taken to mean that doctors are
declaring patients brain dead when they are not, say authors of
related articles accompanying the study published in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Rather, ``they might be hesitant in making a diagnosis of brain
death if they were uncertain about what it is to be brain dead,''
said one author, Dr. Joseph M. Darby, director of trauma and
neurosurgical intensive care at Presbyterian-University Hospital in
Pittsburgh.
   ``Confusion and or delays amongst health-care personnel might be
an impediment to organ retrieval,'' he said in a telephone
interview Thursday.
   Researchers in Cleveland asked 195 health professionals at four
university affiliated hospitals there to answer the question:
``What brain functions must be lost for a patient to be declared
brain dead?''
   The professionals included 39 doctors likely to be required to
make direct decisions about brain death and 156 doctors and nurses
who might be involved in the care of brain-dead patients, the
researchers said.
   Thirty-three of the 39 decision-makers, or 85 percent, selected
the correct multiple choice answer _ ``irreversible loss of all
brain function.'' Ninety of the 156 others, or 58 percent, picked
the right answer, the researchers reported.
   Incorrect answers included: loss of function of the brain stem,
which is necessary for consciousness; loss of function of the
cortex, which is necessary for higher reasoning; and severe brain
damage, the researchers said.
   In addition, they probed the subjects' personal ideas about what
constitutes death. Researchers found that even among professionals
who knew the medical criterion for brain death, contradictions were
common about why such a criterion indicates a person is really dead.
   Forty-two percent of the whole group consistently said the loss
of higher brain function or the loss of lower brain function was
the reason a brain-dead person is really dead, but ``58 percent did
not use a coherent concept of death consistently,'' the researchers
said.
   Such confusion could hamper efforts to obtain donor organs,
since the ability to obtain them from suitable donors depends
largely on the attitude and commitment of health professionals, the
researchers said.
   Lack of understanding of why brain-dead patients are dead may
not only contribute to professionals' discomfort in managing such
patients, it may also discourage doctors from discussing possible
donation with families, the researchers said.
   Darby, in an accompanying article on the medical management of
brain-dead donors, cited figures indicating that 10,000 to 15,000
donor organs are needed each year. While 12,500 to 27,000 potential
U.S. donors die annually, only 15 percent to 20 percent of
potential donors become actual donors, he and his colleagues said.

   Sen. Alan Simpson is stalling President Bush's
choice to run the EPA's clean air and nuclear programs because of
his ignorance of the problem of airborne radioactive dust from
mining uranium and other minerals.
   Simpson, R-Wyo., on Thursday put a hold on the confirmation of
William Rosenberg, a real estate executive from Ann Arbor, Mich.,
using a parliamentary device.
   ``His interest is in resolving the problems,'' said Mary Kay
Hill, an aide to Simpson. ``He is certainly not trying to torpedo
an individual.''
   Simpson had asked Rosenberg to comment on the question of
airborne radioactive material and fugitive dust produced from
mining for uranium and other minerals.
   The nominee ``didn't indicate that he understood the issue at
all,'' Hill said.
   Environmental regulations set limits on the amount of such
particles that can be released into the air. Simpson maintains that
the EPA should make allowances for particles placed in the air by
natural causes, such as the brisk Wyoming wind, Hill said.
   The Senate Environment Committee approved Rosenberg's nomination
on Tuesday, 15-1. Simpson was the lone dissenter.
   Rosenberg was chairman of the Michigan Public Service
Commission, which regulates utilities, from 1973 to 1975, and moved
from that job to a position as assistant administrator for energy
resource development with the Federal Energy Administration. He
left that position in 1977.

   Despite a declining rate of spina bifida cases in
the United States, the birth defect still leaves thousands of
American children struggling to live with its effects, often at
tremendous cost.
   The national Centers for Disease Control predicted Thursday that
by the end of 1990, the United States will have 13,000 children
born with spina bifida in the 1980s and still living, at an annual
cost of nearly $100 million.
   Each year, about 1,500 children are born in the United States
with spina bifida, the incomplete closing of the bony structure
surrounding the spinal cord. More than 1,000 survive the newborn
days and enter childhood, the CDC said in its weekly report.
   An estimated 9,800 children born with spina bifida between 1980
and 1987 were still alive in 1987, and by the end of 1990, that
number is expected to grow to an estimated 13,000.
   ``In 1990, the average annual cost for medical and surgical care
for all surviving children born (with spina bifida) since 1980 will
approach $100 million,'' the Atlanta-based CDC reported. Further,
the number of surviving spina bifida patients born before 1980 is
``as large as those born after 1980 ... it is likely that their
costs would equal or exceed those of the post-1980 (patients).''
   Spina bifida often strikes along with anencephaly, the absence
of major parts of the brain; in that case, most patients die a few
hours after birth. For the spina bifida patients who survive, life
is expensive.
   ``Infants with spina bifida routinely receive vigorous medical
therapy and undergo repeated surgical procedures to survive and
reach their maximum functional capacity,'' the CDC said, noting
that the lifetime costs for such a patient can reach $250,000.
   The cause of spina bifida is still unknown, but the disease rate
is decreasing _ from a rate of 5.2 cases per 10,000 births in 1980
to 4.3 in 1987. ``Nobody really knows why,'' said Dr. David
Erickson, a CDC birth defects specialist.
   Some of the decrease is due to new high-technology prenatal
testing which gives more mothers the option of terminating problem
pregnancies, ``but that doesn't explain all of it,'' Erickson said.

   Organizations representing the elderly say
they're encouraged about the prospects for a reduction in the
surtax paid for coverage of catastrophic illness under the Medicare
program.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said Thursday that revised revenue estimates
from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on
Taxation show that the government may be collecting more money than
it needs for the program. He said the new projections indicate a
$4.9 billion surplus for the period 1989-1993.
   Bentsen, who heads the Senate Finance Committee, said he sent a
letter to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady asking whether the Bush
administration concurs with the revised revenue estimates.
   ``The Congressional Budget Office concludes that the surplus in
the catastrophic care funds is twice as large as originally
estimated; two times bigger than needed to provide adequate reserve
and contingency margins,'' Bentsen said.
   He suggested that the surtax could be cut ``at least 16
percent'' if the projections are accurate.
   The supplemental premium or surtax enacted in the Medicare
Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 is paid by Medicare recipients
whose federal income tax is at least $150 annually. The tax
increases according to income up to a ceiling of $800.
   Bentsen's letter said ``the cap on the supplemental premium
could be reduced to $500'' if the projections by CBO and the tax
panel are correct.
   Horace Deets, executive director of the American Association for
Retired Persons, said the organization was ``delighted to hear that
beneficiaries may pay less for the expanded Medicare coverage.''
   ``The biggest estimating difficulty we had is identifying how
the elderly are spread across the income levels,'' said Ronald
Pearlman, staff director for the tax panel, in explaining the new
figures.
   Bentsen and Pearlman emphasized that the figures were
preliminary. Pearlman added that the new estimates were not based
on current revenue collection or a change in the economy but
instead were based on the tax panel's use of different economic
models from those used during congressional debate before the
bill's passage last year.
   Since the beginning of the year when the law went into effect,
members of Congress have been flooded with mail from older
Americans objecting to the tax which the lawmakers and former
President Reagan agreed should be paid solely by beneficiaries of
the program.
   ``But it was never our intention that the beneficiaries pay more
than needed to operate this program in a prudent, responsible
fashion,'' said Bentsen.
   ``There are two reasons for us to interpret this as
encouraging,'' said Eric Shulman, legislative director for the
National Council of Senior Citizens.
   ``One is that hopefully this new revenue will yield tangible and
significant reduction in premiums. The other is that it may open
the door to some reconsideration of the financing mechanism,'' said
Shulman.

<HEAD>Shoreham Wins License, Cuomo Vows Appeal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy is calling the
approval of a full-power operating license for the Shoreham nuclear
power plant perhaps the most important development for the nuclear
industry in a decade, but New York Gov. Mario Cuomo has vowed to
appeal the decision.
   The bitterly divided response came as the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission voted 4-0 on Thursday to award a full-power license to
the Long Island plant.
   ``The NRC's full-power license for Shoreham is an emblem of
hypocrisy,'' Cuomo said in a statement from Albany, N.Y. ``We will,
of course, appeal.''
   DOE, on the other hand, saw the development as a milestone,
because it marked the first time a plant has been licensed on the
basis of a utility-drawn evacuation plan, sidestepping the
opposition of local communities.
   ``The NRC's decision reaffirms its confidence not only in the
safety and viability of Shoreham, but in the entire U.S. nuclear
industry as well,'' Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said. ``If
put into operation, Shoreham could spur the recovery of the
industry from the erosion of public confidence that followed the
accident at Three Mile Island in 1979.''
   His department called the Shoreham license ``perhaps the most
important development for the nuclear industry in the United States
in the past decade.''
   But the license may prove to be only a symbol, since the Long
Island Lighting Co., which owns the 809-megawatt reactor, has
agreed not to turn up the power pending a vote by shareholders to
scrap the $5.5 billion plant.
   After the vote Thursday, NRC Chairman Lando Zech said the
commission had fulfilled its duties without regard to whether
Shoreham ever operates.
   ``Our responsibility as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is to
review the application for a license and to determine whether that
application meets our requirements,'' Zech told reporters. ``We
have made such a determination.''
   Zech said the refusal of the state and local governments to
participate in emergency planning ``has been a challenge to this
commission.''
   Asked if he thought it was a waste that Shoreham might never
operate, Zech said, ``As the chairman of the regulatory commission,
that's not my responsibility. As an American citizen, I would call
it a waste.''
   The vote by LILCO shareholders, which must take place by June
15, will make or break a deal under which LILCO would sell Shoreham
to New York state for $1 in exchange for a decade of annual rate
increases. The state would then oversee the decommissioning and
dismantling of the plant that was once touted as the solution to
Long Island's energy shortages.
   Shoreham becomes the first U.S. nuclear plant to be licensed on
the basis of a utility-formulated emergency plan, rather than one
created by the state and local governments.
   LILCO was forced to draw up its own plan after the governments
of New York state, Suffolk County and the Town of Southampton
withdrew support for the plant, contending the zone around Shoreham
could not be safely evacuated. They cited Long Island's large
population and the dearth of roads leading away from the plant as
impediments.
   Rep. George Hochbrueckner, a Democrat whose district includes
Shoreham, called the license ``an insult to the people of Long
Island.''
   ``The people of Long Island are sick and tired of being bullied
by a pro-nuclear NRC,'' he said.
   But LILCO Vice President Joseph McDonnell hailed the license as
a ``prerequisite for establishing a national nuclear policy.''
   ``It's been a long and difficult road but I maintain the
full-power license decision says clearly and definitively that
Shoreham is a safe plant and that the politicians who opposed this
plant have been flat wrong,'' he said.

   Disabling headaches force people to miss an
average of 1{ days of work each year, according to a new study that
also reinforced earlier findings that women were afflicted more
often and more seriously than men.
   The study published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association found that most people suffered 10 to 12 headaches each
year and about 10 percent of all headaches are migraines,
distinguished from the common or ``tension'' headache by severe
pain, nausea or vomiting, longer duration and a more acute reaction
to sensory stimuli, like light or noise.
   Headaches rank seventh among common complaints needing
outpatient care, and the National Headache Foundation estimates
that direct and indirect costs for medical care and lost workdays
are $6 billion to $10 billion annually.
   Walter Stewart, one of five authors of the Journal report, said
researchers did not try to come up with a dollar figure.
   The Journal study involved telephone interviews with 10,169
residents of Washington County, Md., ages 12 to 29.
   It was significant both because it focused on a large-scale
population at highest risk for the onset of serious headaches and
because it gathered data on both long-term problems and headaches
in the previous four weeks.
   Among its findings:
   _ Women, who reported suffering headaches more often and more
seriously than men, missed an average 1.8 days annually, compared
to 1.2 days for men.
   _ Women said their headaches were of longer duration, more
painful and worsened with age. Duration and intensity remained
largely constant with men as they aged.
   _ The most pronounced disablity was reported by women 24 to 29 _
the same group in which the least disability was described by males.
   _ 76 percent of females and 57 percent of males reported a
headache in the previous four weeks; 14 percent of females and 6
percent of males reported four or more in that period; for
migraines, 7 percent of females and 3 percent of males reported an
episode in the four-week period.
   _ Women said headaches, on average, last 8.2 hours, compared
with 5.9 hours for men.
   ``The trends regarding occurrence and differences between men
and women are not new,'' said Stewart, an associate professor of
epidemiology at Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.
``And right now, we can't tell you why.''
   Focusing on such facts will enable the public as well as victims
to benefit, said Dr. Seymour Diamond, a Chicago-based specialist
whose headache clinic is the largest in the United States, and Ray
Dion, executive director of the American Association for the Study
of the Headache.
   ``People are being encouraged to seek us out as more and more
discussion of the subject appears in both the medical and lay
literature ... and this can only accelerate it,'' said Diamond,
whose nationally known clinic treats about 30,000 patients annually.
   ``It used to be rare that we'd see a male patient because being
treated for a headache didn't fit the macho image,'' he added.
``But that has changed gradually and thanks to the information and
publicity from this study and others, fewer people will view
(headaches) as sign of a psychiatric disease or weakness.''
   ``People with allergies go to an allergist, but based on the
letters and phone calls we get, few people with recurring headaches
do anything beyond seeing a general practitioner,'' said Dion,
whose San Clemente, Calif.-based organization serves as a
clearinghouse for physician specialists.
   ``Every effort to educate the public is a welcome one,'' he
added.

   House Speaker Jim Wright's wife kept no records of her work for
an investment company formed by the Wrights and another Texas
couple because it was a ``piddling little mom-and-pop operation,''
she said in interviews published today.
   ``We were all friends,'' Betty Wright told The Washington Post
in an interview published in today's editions. ``There was no
reason to document anything. I had some notes, but I don't know
where they are and they are probably thrown away by now.''
   In remarks published in today's New York Times, she said:
``There was no time clock and we were not keeping records. It was
just the four of us. We all trusted each other.''
   The speaker faces 69 allegations of House rules violations
brought by the ethics committee. Among the accusations is that Mrs.
Wright was paid for work she did not do for the investment firm,
Mallightco Inc.
   The 64-year-old Mrs. Wright, along with her husband, formed the
company with friends from Fort Worth, George and Marlene Mallick.
   She said it was just part of the business arrangement if Mallick
gave her the use of a condominium in Fort Worth or if he gave her a
Cadillac.
   ``I think it is unfair to criticize it because that is the way
George Mallick did business,'' she told the Times. ``That is the
way he operated. Other employees had condos and cars, he had a
fleet of cars. I certainly don't think he was funneling anything to
me. It was just part of the employment,'' she said.
   She said she has been unfairly portrayed as a domineering,
scheming wife who liked to spend money on expensive things and
coaxed her husband into politically risky financial ventures.
   ``Oh, well, they are making me a Nancy Reagan,'' she said. ``I
felt sorry for her when they did it to her. I don't know why they
ever started on me.''
   ``Neither Jim nor I ever intended to evade the law in any way,
shape or form,'' she told the Post. ``My God, he's been there for
30 years. Why all of a sudden would he do a shady thing like that?
He wouldn't jeopardize his career over a piddling little
mom-and-pop operation. ''

<HEAD>California Company Develops Test For Blood-Borne Hepatitis</HEAD>

   California scientists have developed a test
that they say can detect a virus thought to cause 90 percent of all
hepatitis disease spread by blood transfusions.
   ``The advent of the specific, sensitive test ... should improve
the safety of the world's blood supply as well as provide an
important clinical diagnostic tool,'' said a report in this week's
edition of the journal Science, released today.
   Scientists at the Chiron Corp. in Emeryville, Calif., report in
one article on experiments that have characterized the antibodies
to the virus causing a type of hepatitis called non-A, non-B. It is
thought to infect up to 10 percent of all blood transfusions.
   Type non-A, non-B is so named because it was of an unknown
origin. The Chiron researchers have now labeled it hepatitis C or
HCV.
   The scientists report in a second article in the same journal
that they developed a screening test that was able to successfully
detect antibodies to the disease, thus providing a method of
testing blood transfusions for the presence of the virus.
   Hepatitis is an infectious disease that attacks the liver.
Though most patients with hepatitis recover with few lingering
effects, the disease can cause serious and sometimes fatal
complications. It can lead to cirrhosis, a hardening and gradual
failure of the liver that can cause death. The disease also has
been associated with liver cancer.
   To verify the HCV screening test, the researchers analyzed coded
blood samples from 16 patients. The patients included nine who were
proven by other tests to have hepatitis C, five normal blood
donors, a patient with alcoholic hepatitis, and a patient with
biliary cirrhosis, a liver disease.
   The Chiron assay detected hepatitis C antibodies in all but two
of those infected with the disease.
   Next, the researchers tested the 138 blood donations that had
been given to 10 patients who later developed chronic hepatitis C.
With only one exception, the tests found hepatitis C infection in
at least one blood donor for each of the blood transfusion
recipients. This showed the test could successfully screen donated
blood and identify those samples that were infected. Hepatitis C
antibodies were not detected in a control group of blood samples
tested at the same time.
   A further test was conducted on samples obtained from patients
in Italy and in Japan. The antibodies were detected in 84 percent
of the Italian patients who had been diagnosed with the hepatitis
infection. For the Japanese patients, 78 percent were found to be
positive for chronic infection, and 15 percent with acute
infection, a less serious condition that is healing.
   Chiron Corp. researchers, led by Qui-Lim Choo and G. Kuo, were
the lead scientists in the study, but the Science articles also
credit researchers at the Centers for Disease Control, the UCLA
School of Medicine, the University of Southern California, the
National Institutes of Health, Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston, the New York Blood Center, the Community Blood Center of
Kansas City, and two groups of researchers from Italy.

   A century after this sleepy railway stop
emerged from the prairie as a teeming tent city, crowds again are
converging on this historic territorial capital.
   On April 22, 1889, more than 40,000 anxious settlers toed the
borders of 2 million acres of unassigned lands to claim 160-acre
farms or town lots.
   They came by train, on horseback and on foot, in wagons and on
bicycles, pushing carts and driving oxen to one of the nation's
last frontiers.
   This weekend, organizers of centennial observances in Guthrie
say they are preparing for traffic jams when up to 100,000 people
show up for parades, re-enactments, rodeos and other events in the
central Oklahoma community of 10,300.
   The ``Run of '89,'' the first of five land runs used to settle
land in the former Indian Territory, marked the first white
settlement in what would become the 46th state in 1907.
   Although some Indian groups are participating, others object to
the festivities.
   ``We're in the ghetto while the people who stole our land are
enjoying prosperity,'' said Francis Wise, a member of an
organization of groups calling itself the Tribal Voices coalition.
   ``In all the festivities where Indians are included throughout
this land run celebration, we're being asked to put on feathers and
dance and sing and help the white community celebrate the land
run,'' she said. ``They're asking us to dance on the graves of our
people.''
   Historians say there is little argument that the government
cheated Indians out of their land in Oklahoma. Organizers of
centennial observances say they have tried to be sensitive to
Indian concerns.
   After the Civil War, cowboys drove cattle from Texas to Kansas
over the Chisholm Trail through Oklahoma until a railroad connected
Gainesville, Texas, and Arkansas City, Kan., in 1887.
   Guthrie and the future Oklahoma City became minor rail stops on
that line.
   The focus of the yearlong series of celebrations and tourism
promotion efforts is the historic district of Guthrie, where 40
blocks of Victorian buildings recall the years Guthrie served as
territorial and state capital.
   Both Guthrie, on Cottonwood Creek, and Oklahoma City to the
south along the Santa Fe Railroad tracks were born full-grown on
that single day in 1889 _ each with an estimated overnight
population of more than 10,000.
   Guthrie became the territorial capital, graced with fine
architecture of the period and a bustling downtown. It served as
the state capital until 1910, when the state seal moved to Oklahoma
City in what Guthrie residents still consider a case of theft.
   Oklahoma City continued to grow into a city of more than
400,000, while Guthrie stayed much as it was. But such lack of
growth has turned into an asset.
   ``By the town almost being forgotten for a number of years, it
preserved the history and the heritage,'' said Carol Ringrose, a
spokeswoman for the local centennial observance.
   In 1975, 1,400 acres of Guthrie was placed in the National
Register of Historic Places. Nearly half of the 4,700 homes in the
town are certified Victorian. Restorations aim at making the city a
living museum.

   A California winery worker has told Mexican
officials he decided to kill his family the day after he came home
to find his children alone and his wife out late on what he thought
was a tryst.
   Following that confession, Ramon Salcido asked the officials to
return him to the United States to be tried for seven murders.
   ``He was very passive. Like he was talking about the most normal
thing in the world,'' Fernando Arias, spokesman for the Federal
Attorney General's Office, said Thursday.
   Later Thursday, Salcido was flown back to California.
   As he was being deported, Salcido told a U.S. television field
producer that he had no regrets for his murderous rampage.
   Arias gave this account of Salcido's confession to Mexican
authorities on Wednesday:
   Salcido said his anger began to build about 4 p.m. on April 13
when he returned home from his job at a winery in Sonoma County,
Calif., to find his three little girls alone.
   Depressed and wondering about his wife, Angela Richards, the
28-year-old forklift operator said he left his children and went to
local bar for a few beers. When he returned home, Ms. Richards
still was not there, he said.
   Salcido said his wife arrived late that evening and he accused
her of having an affair with fellow winery worker Tracy Toovey.
   He had long suspected the two of being romantically involved,
and said he and his wife had had marital problems ever since they
wed in December 1984.
   When Salcido awoke early on the morning of April 14, the killing
began.
   First, he said, he killed his wife, shooting her three times
while his daughters slept. Then he drove to the Grand Cru winery
and shot Toovey to death, Salcido said.
   Next, he went to the home of his mother-in-law, Marian Louise
Richards, 47. He said he thought she knew and approved of the
alleged affair.
   Salcio said he killed her and her two young daughters, Ruth, 12,
and Marie, 8.
   Then he went home, he said, and slashed the throats of his
daughters. He killed Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1, but only wounded
2-year-old Carmina.
   Salcido said he headed immediately for the Mexican border. He
left his car behind and entered Mexico without identification and
with little cash. He said he took a bus to a small town east of his
hometown of Los Mochis in northwestern Mexico and spent three days
with his grandmother.
   He said he told her of the killings and the two cried together.
   He called his mother to tell her he might never see her again.
   Early Wednesday morning, federal agents picked up Salcido
outside Los Mochis. The attorney general's office said he was
riding a bus when he was arrested at a roadblock set up by drug
agents outside the village of Guasave.
   Authorities flew Salcido to the Pacific Coast resort of
Mazatlan, where he confessed to federal agents and in an interview
broadcast on national Mexican television.
   ``I'm guilty,'' he said in the interview. ``I did the killings
in the United States and I expect to be judged there.''
   He was flown to Mexico City on Thursday and deported to the
United States aboard a private jet provided to Sonoma County
authorities by ``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles Schulz.
   Salcido was shackled to another man at the rear of the Mexicana
airlines plane that brought him to Mexico City, said George
Ramirez, a field producer with KRON-TV in San Francisco.
   ``He was very tense. He was always moving his head around,
looking,'' said Ramirez, who was on the flight. Ramirez said he had
a brief conversation in English with Salcido.
   When asked if he had any regrets, Salcido replied, ``No.''
   When asked if he had anything to say to his daughter who
survived, Salcido also replied, ``No.''

   Ramon Salcido left Mexico as a
teen-ager in search of a better life in the United States. When his
dream turned into a bloody nightmare, he sneaked home a fugitive.
   The California winery worker's desperate flight following the
April 14 slayings of his wife, two of his daughters and four other
people ended with his arrest on the hot coastal plains of
northwestern Mexico.
   Mexican authorities say Salcido was captured early Wednesday
when drug agents stopped the bus he was riding in at a roadblock
outside Guasave, a village 50 miles east of Los Mochis, his
hometown.
   He told authorities he visited his 74-year-old grandmother,
Jesus Armendariz, and wept with her.
   A neighbor, Gildaro Gutierrez, said soldiers raided the
grandmother's modest home Wednesday in a farming hamlet near
Guasave.
   He said four pickup trucks and an automobile loaded with
soldiers and plainclothes agents pulled up at 1 a.m. and took away
Salcido's uncle. The convoy returned again a half-hour later, but
quickly left, Gutierrez said.
   He said he didn't know Salcido and had seen no strangers or
anything suspicious at Ms. Armendariz's house before the raid.
   Local reporters found a cot inside a shed adjoining the house
and several pieces of clothing, including a pair of U.S.-made boots.
   Ms. Armendariz's house is only three miles from a train station
on the rail line from the border city of Mexicali, where Salcido
also has relatives.
   A few days before his capture, Salcido, 28, telephoned his
mother, Valentina Bojorquez Armendariz.
   Neither Salcido's mother nor his grandmother were at home
Thursday and neighbors did not know where they had gone.
   Mrs. Bojorquez earlier told the local newspaper El Debate that
her son telephoned her the day of the killings.
   ``Mother, I have problems. I am going to kill myself. I am
calling you because it is the last time you will hear my voice,''
Mrs. Bojorquez said her son told her.
   She said Ramon, the eldest of her six children, left Los Mochis
when he was 16 to seek work in the United States.
   Mrs. Bojorquez, 49, said she could not believe her son had
killed his wife and two daughters, even though he had confessed. A
third daughter is recovering from a slashed throat.
   Mrs. Bojorquez said her son brought the family to visit her at
Christmas in 1987. It was the last time she saw him.
   ``Everything seemed normal. It seemed they lived happily,'' she
said.

   Sen. Alan Simpson is stalling President Bush's
choice to run the EPA's clean air and nuclear programs because
Simpson contends the nominee shows no understanding of the problem
of airborne radioactive dust from mining uranium and other minerals.
   Simpson, R-Wyo., on Thursday put a hold on the confirmation of
William Rosenberg, a real estate executive from Ann Arbor, Mich.,
using a parliamentary device.
   ``His interest is in resolving the problems,'' said Mary Kay
Hill, an aide to Simpson. ``He is certainly not trying to torpedo
an individual.''
   Simpson had asked Rosenberg to comment on the question of
airborne radioactive material and fugitive dust produced from
mining for uranium and other minerals.
   The nominee ``didn't indicate that he understood the issue at
all,'' Hill said.
   Environmental regulations set limits on the amount of such
particles that can be released into the air. Simpson maintains that
the EPA should make allowances for particles placed in the air by
natural causes, such as the brisk Wyoming wind, Hill said.
   The Senate Environment Committee approved Rosenberg's nomination
on Tuesday, 15-1. Simpson was the lone dissenter.
   Rosenberg was chairman of the Michigan Public Service
Commission, which regulates utilities, from 1973 to 1975, and moved
from that job to a position as assistant administrator for energy
resource development with the Federal Energy Administration. He
left that position in 1977.

   A California winery worker who
admitted killing seven people, including his wife and two of his
daughters, was returned to the United States on Thursday.
   Ramon Salcido, who had been sought since the slayings last week
in California, was arrested early Wednesday near his hometown of
Los Mochis, in the western state of Sinaloa.
   He was brought to Mexico City Thursday afternoon, was deported
and quickly put onto a jet for a flight to California, the
officials said.
   He arrived amid tight security at Sonoma County Airport just
outside Santa Rosa in northern California late Thursday night.
   Salcido, smiling faintly at the crowd of Sonoma County Sheriff's
deputies and reporters, was quickly led to a sheriff's van and
taken to the county jail.
   ``In his statements (to Mexican federal authorities), Salcido
himself said he was an American citizen and asked to be sent to the
United States of America to be judged for the homicides he has
committed,'' the Mexican attorney general's office said in a
statement.
   ``As a result, after a brief stopover in Mexico City, Mr. Ramon
Salcido was turned over today to immigration authorities and
expelled from this country within the framework of existing laws,''
it said.
   Earlier, NBC News quoted Salcido as saying upon his arrival in
Mexico City, ``I want to be tried in an American court and face an
American jury.''
   The government did not immediately disclose how Salcido was
flown out. But airport logs showed that a jet provided to Sonoma
County authorities by ``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles Schulz left
the airport later Thursday afternoon.
   The plane had arrived in Mexico City on Wednesday carrying
officials from Sonoma County, Calif., where the crimes were
committed and where Schulz lives. Airport logs indicated the jet
was to make a refueling stop in Hermosillo, in northern Mexico.
   In San Francisco, U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said the
federal government would seek to dismiss an unlawful flight charge
against Salcido in Sonoma County Municipal Court on Friday.
   He said he was aware of no assurances that had been given to
Salcido that he would not face the death penalty.
   Salcido, wearing a dark T-shirt, was hustled aboard the plane,
airport attendants said. They refused to be identified because they
are not authorized to speak to the press.
   Salcido claimed to be an American citizen, according to Mexican
authorities, even though U.S. authorities said they had no record
he had been naturalized. If Salcido had been treated as a Mexican
citizen, lengthy extradition proceedings might have been necessary.
   ``The assistance of the Mexican government, and in particular of
the attorney general's office, is greatly appreciated,'' said the
U.S. Embassy in a statement.
   George Ramirez, a field producer with KRON-TV in San Francisco,
traveled to Mexico City on the same plane as Salcido and said he
had a brief conversation in English with him.
   When asked if he had anything to say to his surviving 2-year-old
daughter, who he tried to kill, Salcido said ``No,'' Ramirez said.
When asked if he had any regrets, Salcido also said ``No.''
   When asked about his motive, Salcido replied: ``I'll do all my
explaining to U.S. authorities.''
   Salcido, a 28-year-old forklift operator at a Sonoma county
winery north of San Francisco, admitted to the slayings Wednesday
night in a TV interview and said he made his way back to Mexico to
see his parents for the last time. He refused to discuss his
motives.
   Federal officials said he had told agents he killed his
American-born wife, Angela Richards, and a winery co-worker, Tracy
Toovey, and five other people in a jealous rage when he came to
believe Toovey and his wife were romantically involved.
   The only survivor of the rampage, his 2-year-old daughter
Carmina, is recovering from a slashed throat.
   Spokesman Hector Aguilar said Salcido ``has been living in the
United States for nine years, and according to his statement (when
interrogated), he said he acquired American citizenship and was
married to an American.''
   Salcido told police interrogators he drove to Mexico through the
border crossing at Calexico, Calif., hid in a village along the way
for three days, and then headed for Los Mochis.
   Last week, Salcido had been served with Fresno County, Calif.,
court papers ordering him to pay $511 a month support for a
4{-year-old daughter from another marriage, plus nearly $6,000 to
the county for back payments.

   The U.S. dollar closed lower Friday against the
Japanese yen, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange also
finished the week lower.
   The dollar closed at 131.45 yen, down 0.83 yen from Thursday's
close of 132.28 yen. The currency started at 131.35 yen and traded
from 131.30 yen to 131.75 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which shed 178.68 points
Thursday, lost another 155.34 points, or 0.47 percent, to close at
33,029.81.
   Traders said the dollar's opening lower followed its slide on
overseas markets after a round of interest rate hikes by several
European countries.
   West Germany's central bank raised interest rates, including its
official discount rate by half a percentage point to 4.5 percent,
effective Friday, to stem inflation, while similar moves were taken
by other central banks in the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark.
   A dealer with the Bank of Japan described the trading as mixed.
   ``There are a group of investors showing concern over a possible
move by the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates in the future,
while others are concerned over a (possible) similar move by U.S.
monetary authorities,'' said the dealer, who would not be quoted by
name.
   Japan's discount rate, which the central bank charges on its
loans to commercial banks, is 2.5 percent, the lowest among major
industraialized countries.

   The Minnesota House tried an interesting
angle when a debate over changing the date of the walleye fishing
opener hit a snag over a conflict with Mother's Day observances.
   Opponents said the change would mean the opener _ a cherished
rite of spring in the state _ would fall on Mother's Day weekend 18
times in the next 22 years, compared with only nine times under
current law.
   The law currently has the walleye, sauger, northern pike and
bass season openers beginning on the Saturday closest to May 15.
   A compromise amendment reached Thursday says mothers can fish
for free on the opening weekend of the season.
   Rep. Dee Long asked how conservation officers would be able to
tell whether a woman is a mother and thus entitled to fish without
a license.
   The author of the Mother's Day compromise amendment, Rep. Dave
Gruenes, retorted, ``I think what you do is ask; moms don't lie.''

   The Florida Supreme Court has made it
legal. Legal documents can't be put on legal-sized sheets of paper
anymore.
   The high court, in an order issued Thursday, said filings of
pleadings, motions and other documents in all state courts
beginning Jan. 1 must be on 8{-by-11-inch paper.
   Chief Justice Raymond Ehrlich, who issued the ruling on
legal-size paper, said federal appellate courts require the
letter-size paper. There is no rule now specifying the size of
paper to be used in Florida courts, but legal-sized sheets _ 8{ by
14 inches _ are common.
   Clerks at the Palm Beach County Courthouse were bewildered by
the Supreme Court's interest in paper size. Most shook their heads,
raised their eyebrows and wondered if the high court didn't have
enough work to do.
   ``It will probably save a few trees,'' admitted Mary Ann
Susdorf, supervisor of the felony division. ``Isn't that the whole
idea?''

   Senators will start hearing evidence in the
impeachment trial of U.S. District Court Judge Alcee L. Hastings on
July 10.
   A special committee formed for the trial, headed by Sen. Jeff
Bingaman, D-N.M., also said Thursday that an Aug. 4 target date has
been set for wrapping up the presentation of the evidence,
according to spokesman Tony Harvey.
   Harvey said the committee decided to defer any decision on a
request from Hastings attorney Terence Anderson of Miami for
$200,000 in expenses from the government and an unspecified amount
in fees to conduct the defense of the 52-year-old judge.
   Hastings, of Miami, was named in 17 articles of impeachment
approved by the House 413-3 on Aug. 3. The document accuses him of
plotting to obtain a payoff and improperly disclosing secret
wiretap information. The Senate must now decide whether to convict
Hastings and thus remove him from office and stop his $89,500
annual salary.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp says authorities
will have to consider the role parents played in drug activity by
their children before evicting entire families from public housing.
   Kemp, who has encouraged efforts to rid public housing of drug
users and sellers, said Thursday that in some cases parents may be
unable to control older, physically strong children who are engaged
in drug activity. In those cases, he said, ``I don't think Mom and
Dad should be punished'' by eviction.
   But he said there are cases where mothers or other heads of
families are participants in drug enterprises, sometimes with their
children.
   ``Let the tenants and the (public housing agencies) throw them
out,'' the secretary of Housing and Urban Development said. ``On
the first, first _ one, one _ time you're caught doing, dealing,
engaging in drug traffic, I would say, out.''

   The Coast Guard boarding of a Taiwanese ship
suspected of illegal drift-netting demonstrates U.S. concern over a
fishing technique that can wipe out large numbers of sea creatures,
a State Department official says.
   ``This is a very serious matter and it would be an
understatement to say this heightens the issue,'' Ed Wolfe, the
State Department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said
Thursday. ``The U.S. position is there should be no drift-net
fishing at all. It is wasteful and inefficient.''
   An estimated 700 fishing boats from Taiwan, South Korea and
Japan have been using drift-nets in the northern Pacific Ocean to
catch squid since the early 1980s. The nets are up to 35 miles long
and can cover more than 30,000 square miles of ocean.
   U.S. fishermen charge the nets snare North American salmon and
the illegal catches have already impacted fish runs in Alaska,
Washington state and Oregon.
   Coast Guard officers boarded the Taiwanese ship the Cyi Yang No.
1 late Wednesday in the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles southwest
of the Aleutian Islands because of the use of drift-netting.

   The idea that wealth brings happiness is
suffering a blow from medical researchers who say depression is
striking more often in affluent nations, particularly among younger
people.
   ``It's sort of a paradox that the baby-boom generation
physically is the healthiest generation in history, and grew up in
a time of great economic prosperity, and yet they have this sense
of malaise and disappointment,'' said Dr. Gerald Klerman, co-author
of a new report.
   Klerman of the Cornell University Medical College and colleague
Myrna Weissman reviewed 13 studies of depression involving more
than 30,000 people. Their findings were published in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The researchers analyzed data on hospital admissions,
psychiatric diagnoses and suicides, and found a marked increase in
depression among the post-World War II baby boomers in North
America and Western Europe.
   They also said the problem has become more prevalent among young
men and teen-agers, though their report supplied no figures.
   Klerman said the research showed people ages 15 to 40 in North
America and Europe were about twice as likely to experience
depression in the 1960s and 1970s than they were before World War
II.
   ``Depression seems to be the price of civilization,'' Klerman
said.
   Ms. Weissman, an epidemiologist at the New York State
Psychiatric Institute, said: ``Depression used to be a disorder of
middle-aged women. The strange thing you see happening is
depression is starting in adolescents.''
   The researchers found that in each of 10 surveys from the United
States, Canada, Sweden, Germany and New Zealand, depression
increased among people born after the end of World War II.
   But in three studies of people in Korea, Puerto Rico and
Mexican-Americans living in Los Angeles, the researchers found
little difference in the rates of depression between those born
before and those born after the war.
   They speculated that the lower depression rate in those
societies could stem from stronger family ties and less mobility,
and the American-European rate could be boosted by drug use.
   ``We're always making or breaking attachment bonds,'' Klerman
said. ``We give up some of the social supports and stable
relationships.
   Mark Walker, who works in the adolescent psychiatry program at
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said the study appears
to debunk the idea that wealth brings happiness.
   ``It's interesting that these increasing rates of depression
have happened in Western nations during a period of relative
prosperity,'' Walker said. ``For society as a whole, affluence does
not seem to protect people from getting depressed, but in fact it
may be a risk factor.''
   Walker also speculated that the increasing rates of depression
and suicide among youth could be a result of postwar wealth in
North America and Europe.
   ``Young people lack a certain degree of meaning in their
lives,'' he said. ``That is a result of an increasingly affluent
society able to support people having a longer adolescence when
they do not have to work to survive.''

<TEXT>
   The Lone Star Cafe, that Greenwich Village home
away from home for lonesome Texans and country-rooted urbanites, no
longer can claim it's the best honky tonk north of Abilene.
   The bar, easily located by the 41-foot long, 3,000-pound
fiberglass iguana on its roof and a giant fiberglass dragonfly
inside, closed last weekend.
   Going to the Lone Star was something even real Texans admitted
doing when in New York City. It became a mecca for country music
just as ``Urban Cowboy'' mania was sweeping the nation in the late
1970s.
   The Texas Legislature in 1981 thought enough of the Lone Star to
make it the official Texas ``embassy'' in New York City, and said
the club's location, at Fifth Avenue and 13th Street, was sovereign
Texas soil ``now and forever.''
   Alas, just as everything's big in Texas, so was the rent
increase announced at lease renewal time. The Lone Star's landlord
trebled the rent.
   Co-owners Bill Dick and Mort Cooperman bid a daylong adios to
the Lone Star Cafe last week and reminisced about the time a drunk
fell into the arms of visiting King Juan Carlos of Spain, and how
Larry King, author of ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,''
decreed the club would never succeed when it opened its doors in
1977.
   Dick and Cooperman, riding high on the Cafe's success, last
summer opened a second Texas-style retreat, The Lone Star
Roadhouse, in Manhattan.
   Frank Mills, a Lone Star regular, hopes the Lone Star Roadhouse
will be just like his old haunt.
   ``The Lone Star was a place you could strike up a good
conversation and listen to great music,'' said Mills, an aspiring
songwriter from Brooklyn who says it's taken time to get used to
the uptown location, which has decor similar to the old location.
   Anne Segrest, a manager at the new place, is convinced Cafe
regulars will flock uptown.
   ``There's no other place in New York that they can listen to Joe
Ely or Delbert McClinton,'' said Segrest of the Southwest singers.

   Government raids on a leftist
union federation, a refugee group and a women's organization are
part of a repression campaign by the new presidential
administration, group leaders say.
   ``Repression has increased'' since President-elect Alfredo
Cristiani's March 19 electoral victory, said Tomasa Ruiz, a
director for the Christian Committee for Displaced People, which
was raided early Thursday.
   ``The Christian Democrats repressed us, too, but now it is more
blatant,'' she said.
   Cristiani takes office June 1 from incumbent Christian Democrat
Jose Napoleon Duarte. Christiani is a member of the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.
   Arena founder Roberto D'Aubuisson has been linked to right-wing
death squad activity in the early 1980s. Arena leaders deny any
ties to death squads.
   Soldiers and police arrested more than 100 people in raids
Wednesday and Thursday on the three organizations, group leaders
said.
   Military authorities said 72 people were arrested and 20 of
these later were released.
   Ruiz said Treasury Police and 1st Army Brigade soldiers arrested
about 75 people, including around 30 children, during the raid on
the committee's downtown San Salvador headquarters.
   A Treasury Police spokesman said 57 people were arrested,
including three foreigners _ a U.S. citizen, a Briton and a West
German.
   The American, identified as Victoria Groebel, 31, of Baltimore,
and British citizen Evelyn Scarfe were still under arrest early
today. Both reportedly worked with the Christian Committee for
months.
   West German Hans Gebauer was released Thursday, authorities said.
   Treasury Police Col. Francisco Calderon told reporters officials
had a search warrant. He said three wounded guerrillas were among
those arrested and would be turned over to the Red Cross.
   Mauricio Ortega, 22, denied he was a rebel fighter. He spoke
with journalists at Treasury Police headquarters.
   Calderon said people still held would be charged within 72 hours
or released, as stipulated by the constitution.
   In a separate raid, Treasury Police entered Unified Labor
Federation headquarters late Wednesday and arrested about 20
unionists, according to union leaders and military authorities.
Police displayed a pistol, explosives, a small printing press and
barbs for puncturing tires.
   Union leaders reported about 10 women were arrested in a raid on
the downtown office of the Salvadoran Women's Association late
Wednesday.
   Francisco Martinez, a director of the National Union of
Salvadoran Workers, said the raids formed part of ``an escalation
of repression by the armed forces and Arena.''
   The raids came hours after Attorney General Roberto Garcia
Alvarado was assassinated by a bomb put on the roof of his Jeep
Cherokee while it was stopped at a traffic light.
   Cristiani and U.S. Ambassador William Walker both have accused
the rebels of launching an assassination and bombing campaign to
try to provoke human rights abuses by the military and incoming
Arena government. They said this would be used in the United States
to lobby for a cutoff of U.S. aid.
   After the raids, Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides
Casanova and Col. Rene Ponce, chief of the joint chiefs of staff
met with lawmakers.
   Vides told journalists he discussed a possible state of siege,
which would suspend constitutional guarantees.
   The war between the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front and the U.S.-backed government has displaced an estimated 1
million people.
   Two radio stations received anonymous telephone calls Thursday
saying the Gerardo Barrios Civic Forces _ not known previously _
was responsible for Garcia Alvarado's assassination.
   The caller accused Arena of fomenting ``conspiracy and intrigue
within the armed forces.'' Gen. Gerardo Barrios was a 19th-century
statesman considered the founder of the Salvadoran army.
   There was no way to confirm the authenticity of the call or the
existence of the organization.

<HEAD>Interior Secretary Visits Cleanup, Soviet Skimmer At Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL JENKINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NAKED ISLAND, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a few seconds, Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. tottered this way and that on an
oil-slickened rock. A worker laboring to rid the shore of gooey oil
stepped in and saved him from an embarrassing fall.
   While Lujan and two congressman were touring a section of the
Prince William Sound shoreline Thursday, a giant Soviet oil skimmer
was testing its booms at Resurrection Bay some 80 miles west in the
Gulf of Alaska.
   The Coast Guard plainly was delighted with the promise of
progress brought by the 425-foot Vaidogubsky, and gains made by a
120-foot Mr. Clean III, a skimmer from Santa Barbara, Calif.
   ``This was a major step, having those two skimmers out there,''
said Coast Guard Lt. Gary Stock, who was monitoring the cleanup in
Anchorage.
   Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard in Valdez estimated that more
than 2 million gallons of the 10.1 million-gallon spill was
recoverable from the surface of the gulf and Prince William Sound.
The spill occurred March 24 after the tanker Exxon Valdez hit Bligh
Reef.
   Lujan, Reps. Don Young, R-Alaska, and Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and a
sizable entourage flew from Valdez on Thursday by helicopter to
Naked Island, a remote beach 45 miles to the southwest.
   The group got a look at the only area in Prince William Sound
where shoreline cleanup operations have started. Exxon estimates it
has cleaned 2,100 feet of the more than 300 miles of oil-splotched
shore.
   As Lujan inspected the cleanup effort, oil glistened off rocks
or stood in gleaming puddles in the bright sun. A black stain along
the driftwood-strewn beach marked the high-tide line. The smell of
crude was strong.
   From a distance, the shore was a palette of oil-smeared workers
clad in hard hats and bright orange, yellow and black rainwear.
They used fire hoses to blast oil off a 75-yard stretch of rocky
beach as the sun played through the mist, casting rainbows.
   Landing craft laden with heavy equipment hugged the shore, and
an oil skimmer dipped up the runoff from the beach facing McPherson
Passage.
   Lujan, wearing an orange float suit, picked his way to the end
of the beach nearest his aircraft, and in moments was posing with a
fire hose for photographs.
   Before it was over, several of the secretary's traveling
companions had joined him. Laughing, they enthusiastically blasted
the oily mess with such force that it carried over a boom and into
the water workers were trying to protect. That sparked an obscenity
laced tirade from people on a barge nearby.
   Retreating, Lujan said, ``It looks like this is going to be a
big job to clean up.''
   But he said it was too early for him to know what he would tell
President Bush come Monday.
   Lujan and the congressmen were briefed early Thursday by the
U.S. Coast Guard in Valdez, then by Exxon officials.
   Weldon, a member of the House's Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee, said he was unimpressed.
   ``There were a lot of people covering their rear ends,'' he said.
   Weldon noted the two briefings covered essentially the same
ground, ``but they were completely, diametrically opposed.''
   He said the question that must be answered is why _ if there
were a contingency plan _ it was not implemented almost immediately
after the spill.
   Young credited the beach workers with making some headway.
   ``They're making progress, that's the big thing,'' he said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle will stop in Anchorage and Valdez on
May 4-5 as he returns from a Pacific Rim excursion and will tour
spill sites, U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said.

<HEAD>Sakharov, Slate Of Reformers Win Academy Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov,
initially eliminated from the ballot, won a seat in the Soviet
Union's new parliament in a repeat election by the Academy of
Sciences, the Tass news agency reported today.
   Tass announced preliminary results of Thursday's balloting for
12 parliamentary seats to be filled by the prestigious academy.
   Also elected to the Congress of People's Deputies were space
scientist Roald Z. Sagdeev, economist Nikolai Shmelev and Georgy A.
Arbatov, director of the U.S.A. and Canada Institute.
   Tass said Shmelev, who has proposed radical solutions to the
Soviet Union's economic problems, won the most votes, 869 of 1,101.
Sakharov received 806 and Sagdeev received 739, it said.
   Sakharov, Sagdeev and Shmelev were among a slate of reformers on
the list of 28 candidates. Other reformers who won election were
Vitaly Ginzburg and Yuri Karyakin, Tass said.
   The 2,250-member congress will meet for the first time on May 25
to choose from among its members the country's president and a
Supreme Soviet, which will make policy for the nation.
   Sakharov's election ``will be a great success for perestroika,''
said one of his backers, Alexander Sobianen, using the word for
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program.
   Sakharov originally was nominated for the congress in January,
but the academy's screening committee eliminated him and other
reformers when it cut the list of candidates on the final ballot
from more than 100 to 23.
   However, Sakharov's supporters, including Sobianen, charged that
the nominees were old-style academic bureaucrats, and organized a
campaign to reject them. In the first election last month, only
eight of the 23 received more than 50 percent of the vote.
   This time, 28 candidates were nominated for the 12 seats still
open, and Sakharov, Sagdeev, Shmelev and other reformers were
nominated once again.
   Sakharov, a physicist, voted Thursday morning at a polling
station at Moscow State University. He made no comment to reporters.
   Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his rights
activities, was exiled to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980
for criticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. In 1986,
Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow.
   Sakharov has since resumed his scientific work and continues to
speak out on social issues. He supports Gorbachev's reforms but
criticizes what he sees as efforts to slow or reverse them.
   In a speech to the academy Wednesday night, Sakharov again
criticized two laws that allow authorities to use special troops to
quell demonstrations.
   Sakharov blamed the April 9 clash in Tbilisi, the capital of
Soviet Georgia, on such laws and on forces opposed to reforms.
   At least 20 people died when soldiers moved into a crowd of
demonstrators on Tbilisi's main street. A commission is
investigating charges that soldiers used poison gas, shovels and
clubs.
   Hundreds of academy members voted to support a resolution of its
branch in Georgia that called the incident an ``unprecedented
massive beating of innocent people.''
   The Communist Party, trade unions and social and professional
groups such as the academy will elect 750 congressional members.
The 1,500 others are elected from geographical districts.
   In balloting for the geographical districts on March 26, voters
rejected dozens of top party and government officials, many of whom
were running unopposed.
   Repeat elections will be held May 14 for almost 200 seats that
remain unfilled.

<HEAD>Trajectory Change Puts Voyager 2 On Course For Neptune Encounter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zipping through space 2.67 billion miles
from Earth, the Voyager 2 spacecraft changed course in a maneuver
that targeted it for its Aug. 24 picture-taking encounter with
Neptune.
   Thursday's trajectory change took place 183 million miles from
Neptune as the hardy space probe cruised at a speed of 42,279 mph,
said Mary Beth Murrill, spokeswoman for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Radio commands sent by mission controllers traveled at the speed
of light _ nearly 670 million mph _ but still took four hours to
reach the distant Voyager 2, which started its journey in 1977 and
explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   The commands made Voyager 2 fire some of its thrusters and
adjust onboard gyroscopes to execute the course correction, Murrill
said. She added that it as one of the last major maneuvers needed
to propel the probe toward the solar system's eighth planet.
   ``This puts the spacecraft on target for Neptune,'' she said at
the laboratory, which operates America's unmanned space exploration
program for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Voyager 2 is scheduled to take numerous television pictures as
it swoops within 3,013 miles of Neptune's cloud tops Aug. 24.
   The spacecraft is controlled with radio commands sent through
NASA's Deep Space Network, which includes large dish-shaped
antennas in Goldstone, Calif., Spain and Australia.
   The latest maneuver ``was performed during a week of simulations
in which the Voyager team is rehearsing what they will be doing
during the Neptune encounter,'' Murrill said.
   Scientists believe Neptune probably has a watery atmosphere that
slowly blends into an underlying ocean, with no clear boundary
between sky and sea. They believe Triton, one of Neptune's two
known moons which the spacecraft also will fly by, has methane and
water ices on its surface, and possibly lakes or an ocean of liquid
nitrogen.
   After encountering Neptune, Voyager 2 will head out of the solar
system and conduct studies of interstellar space.
   It's twin, Voyager 1, also was launched in 1977, but explored
only Jupiter and Saturn before heading toward the edge of the solar
system.
   NASA officials have said the Voyager flights _ which scientists
have called humanity's most productive space exploration effort _
will cost $920 million by 1995, less than half what the Pentagon
spends during a single work day.
   The Voyagers discovered at least 17 previously unknown moons
orbiting Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Prices Lower Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell today against the Japanese
yen, while prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped after
announcements of interest rate hikes in Europe.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 178.68 points
Thursday, shed another 155.34 points, or 0.47 percent, to finish
trading at 33,029.81.
   The dollar ended the week at 131.45 yen, down 0.83 yen from its
132.28-yen closing on Thursday. The U.S. currency opened lower at
131.35 yen and ranged from 131.30 to 131.75 yen during the day.
   The dollar's lower opening was because of announcements of
interest rate hikes in West Germany and other European nations,
said Ichiro Ikeda of Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   West Germany's central bank raised its official discount rate by
half a percentage point to 4.5 percent, effective today, while
similar moves were taken by central banks in the Netherlands,
Austria and Denmark.
   ``Investors began speculating over a possible interest rate hike
by Japanese monetary authorities in the near future and bought the
yen,'' he said.
   ``But investors then slowed down their yen-buying following
comments by (Japanese) Finance Minister (Tatsuo) Murayama this
morning,'' Ikeda added.
   Murayama said early today that he saw no need at the moment to
raise the country's official discount rate.
   ``I don't see any need for a change in credit conditions,''
Murayama told a news conference following a regular Cabinet meeting.
   On the stock exchange, prices were lower throughout the day
because of the European interest rate hikes and higher oil prices,
said Kenji Ishizuka of Daiwa Securities.
   Oil prices surpassed $22 per barrel following an explosion on a
North Sea oil rig two days ago.
   The Nikkei index plunged in early trading but then made up some
of its losses toward the end of the morning session following
Murayama's comments.
   Despite a massive purchase by Salomon Brothers Ltd. of 15,000
shares of each of the 225 key Nikkei issues to take advantage of
cheaper prices, a majority of participants were reluctant to buy
ahead of the weekend, Daiwa's Ishizuka said.
   Trading was moderate, with volume on the market's first section
estimated at 900 million shares, unchanged from Thursday. Among the
winners were construction and food issues.

<HEAD>Japanese Jets Scramble After Soviet Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Japanese defense force airplanes scrambled
after what was believed to be a Soviet aircraft that twice today
crossed into Japan's northern airspace, a Defense Agency official
said.
   The aircraft intruded into Japanese airspace at 2:36 a.m.,
crossing from north to south over Rebun, a small island off Japan's
main island of Hokkaido, 500 miles northwest of Tokyo, the official
said.
   At 3:51 a.m. near the same area, what local radar monitoring
officials called a ``large-sized aircraft'' flew from the east
toward the south, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The intruding aircraft was in Japanese airspace for 3{ minutes,
the official said.
   Japan's airspace begins 12 nautical miles from shore.
   ``Judging from the flying course the aircraft took, we believed
it might be a Soviet electronics reconnaissance plane,'' the
defense official said.
   In both cases, two F-15 jet fighters were rushed from Chitose
Air Base on Hokkaido but could not identify the aircraft because it
had already left Japanese airspace, the official said. He said a
Japanese air force radar site on Hokkaido warned the aircraft twice
in Russian but received no reply.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry today lodged a strong protest with the
Soviet Union over the alleged Soviet intrusion, a Foreign Ministry
official said.
   Kazuhiko Togo, chief of the ministry's Soviet Division, summoned
Georgy Komarovsky, councillor at the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo, to
the ministry and told him the incident was ``extremely
regrettable,'' the official said. Togo asked the Soviet Union to
take steps to prevent the recurrence of a similar incident.
   The official quoted Komarovsky as telling Togo that he had
``heard nothing about the occurrence of a violation (of airspace).''
   But Komarovsky was quoted as telling Togo he would convey the
Japanese protest and request to his government.
   It was the first violation by a foreign aircraft of Japan's
airspace since a Soviet Tu-16 Badger bomber violated Japanese
airspace over Okinawa in December 1987.
   In that incident, two Japanese jet fighters scrambled from an
Okinawa base and one fired live ammunition as warning shots at the
Soviet plane. It was the first time for a Japanese fighter to fire
warning shots at a Soviet aircraft since the Defense Agency assumed
air defense responsibility in 1958.
   Today's incident brought the number of violations of Japan's
airspace since then to 21, most of which by Soviet aircraft, the
defense official said.

   A furious crowd shouted ``Kill him''
as a winery worker who admitted killing his wife, two of his
daughters and four other people was returned to the wine country
where the slayings occurred.
   Ramon Salcido, 28, was whisked into the Sonoma County jail under
tight security late Thursday night as about 200 people waiting
outside the entrance yelled and waved signs reading ``Yes on
capital punishment'' and ``Salcido doesn't deserve to live.''
   ``I just wanted to see this creature,'' said Nadia Garcia, 40,
of Santa Rosa. ``We are all full of anger and bitterness. I'm
surprised no one got out a gun and shot him.''
   Salcido, who has said he had no regrets about the April 14
killings, has been charged with murder and attempted murder.
   The subject of a massive manhunt, Salcido was arrested Wednesday
in western Mexico, near his hometown of Los Mochis in the state of
Sinaloa.
   He was brought to Mexico City Thursday afternoon, deported by
Mexican authorities and flown back to California on a jet belonging
to ``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles Shulz, who lives in Sonoma County.
   The handcuffed Salcido smiled faintly at the crowd of reporters
and sheriff's deputies when he stepped off the plane at the Sonoma
County Airport late Thursday night.
   He was quickly put in a sheriff's van, driven to the jail, then
transferred to a patrol car and made to lie down as it went past
the shouting crowd, sheriff's Sgt. Carl Dennis said.
   ``A lot of people don't have positive feelings toward this
suspect,'' said reserve sheriff's Deputy John Childers, who guarded
an area near a runway at the rural airfield. ``Someone may take it
on himself to act as an executioner. We don't need that. We are
just trying to prevent that now.''
   A native of Mexico but a legal resident of the United States,
Salcido told Mexican officials after his arrest that he was a U.S.
citizen and asked to be returned north, according to the Mexican
attorney general's office. But U.S. authorities have said they had
no record that Salcido had been naturalized.
   ``I want to be tried in an American court and face an American
jury,'' NBC News quoted Salcido as saying during his brief stopover
in Mexico City.
   Long extradition proceedings might have been necessary if
Salcido had been treated as a Mexican citizen.
   Salcido, a forklift operator at a Sonoma County winery 40 miles
north of San Francisco, admitted the slayings Wednesday night in a
TV interview but refused to discuss his motives.
   He told agents he killed his American-born wife, Angela, 24, and
a winery co-worker, Tracy Toovey, in a jealous rage, believing
Toovey and his wife were romantically involved, according to
federal officials.
   Also killed in a brutal shooting and slashing spree were
Salcido's mother-in-law, his two sisters-in-law and two of his
young daughters. The two sisters-in-law, 8 and 12, also were raped
and sodomized, and one was nearly decapitated.
   His daughter, Carmina, who turns 3 Monday, is recovering from a
slashed throat. She and the bodies of her sisters, 1 and 4, were
found Saturday at a Sonoma County dump. Carmina identified her
father as their attacker, authorities said.
   Salcido so far has been charged with four counts of murder in
connection with the slayings of his wife, Toovey and two daughters.
He also has been charged with three counts of attempted murder in
connection with attacks on Carmina, another co-worker and the
co-worker's wife.

<HEAD>NBC Abortion Movie Highlights Increased Threat of Advocacy Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC was so afraid of hostile advocacy groups
and unnerving advertisers that it shot its dramatization of the
landmark court case that legalized abortion under two phony script
titles.
   The network also insisted on numerous script rewrites, invited
an anti-abortion activist to view ``Roe vs. Wade'' before its May
15 broadcast and tried to prevent the film's author, director and
producer from giving interviews.
   ``They're just terrified of everything at this point,'' said
screenwriter Alison Cross.
   Said the film's star, Holly Hunter: ``I know what they're
worried about. They're afraid we'll say something we're not
supposed to say. ... But the script has a point of view, and so
does history.''
   NBC's fear of an assault from the anti-abortion lobby _ and the
possibility of advertiser defections _ runs so deep that the
network's depiction of the legal pursuit of abortion rights nearly
ended with the suggestion that the court decision be overturned.
   ``It was our fear that in the effort to make this piece balanced
we were going to bend over so far backwards that it was going to
end up pro-life,'' said Cross, referring to herself and ``Roe vs.
Wade'' executive producer Michael Mannheim.
   ``And there were a couple of drafts ... where I felt that ... I
had made all these little changes and I didn't realize how
cumulative they were. Until finally, at the end, you look at the
script and you say, `Boy, this is a hell of a propaganda piece for
the other side,''' said Cross, who was reached independently after
NBC refused to make her available for interviews.
   But why is NBC so afraid to take even the slightest position on
an issue that is, after all, the law, and that a majority of
Americans support?
   The answer speaks loudly to both the fervor of the abortion
debate and the growing clout that advocacy groups wield over the
entertainment industry, evidenced by the religious right's outrage
over ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' which led some theater
chains to refuse to exhibit the movie.
   Next Wednesday, the Supreme Court is to hear arguments in a key
abortion rights case from Missouri that could eventually mean Roe
vs. Wade will be overturned or substantially limited.
   Anthony Masucci, senior vice president of NBC's movies for
television and miniseries, said he thought the story ``made for
what I thought was dramatic, compelling television, without
necessarily getting on a soapbox and preaching about anything.''
   But as soon as Cross sat down to write the screenplay, though,
it became clear that the network's interpretation of ``preaching''
ran far and wide.
   Cross had trouble getting the phrase ``women are dying'' into
the script, and couldn't use the issue of coat hangers in reference
to illegal abortions because, she said, the network considered them
inflammatory and excessive.
   ``There were more than 17 drafts. Finally, we couldn't even
number them anymore,'' Cross said. ``We just put dates on them. I
have a whole shelf full of them.''
   Rosalyn Weinman, NBC's vice president of program standards and
community relations, said it is ``absolutely inaccurate'' to say
NBC tried to soften the movie's inherent pro-choice stance. ``There
was no pressure to make this more pro-choice or more pro-life,''
Weinman said.
   But while the parties involved say they believe the final script
is fair to both sides, the number of rewrites illustrates
Hollywood's anxiety over protests.
   Under pressure recently from viewers and special interest
groups, advertisers have pulled out of NBC's ``Saturday Night
Live,'' the Fox Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Married with Children'' and
ABC's canceled ``Heartbeat.''
   ``I think if this movie were on a year and a half ago, we'd

some fringe elements out there ... and we don't want to raise their
hackles in any way, shape or form.''

   At least 52 people have been killed in mudslides
and flooding in a mountainous region of Soviet Georgia, Radio
Moscow said today.
   Meanwhile, a bus carrying 20 people is missing and may have been
swept off a road by a torrent of mud, an editor at Georgia's
official Gruzinform news agency also reported.
   The editor, who did not give his name, said in a telephone
interview that the mudslides occurred Wednesday evening.
   Radio Moscow said the hardest hit areas were in the Adzharia
region of southern Georgia along the Black Sea coast.
   ``Plans have been worked out to evacuate about 3,000 persons,''
the official radio said, adding, ``Sunday has been declared an
official day of mourning.''
   Tass, the official news agency, said in the first reports on the
disaster Thursday that landslides, avalanches and floods destroyed
or heavily damaged more than 500 houses.
   ``As landslides, snowslips, mudslides and spring floods
continued in Adzaharia for the past several days, destroying
dwellings, administrative buildings, hospitals, schools and roads,
an increasing number of people had to leave the danger zone,'' Tass
said.
   More than 700 families had already been moved to safer regions,
the news agency said.
   It was the second fatal mudslide in the Soviet Union this year.
In January, about 250 people died from mudslides in the Central
Asian republic of Tadjikistan.

   Two college football players have been
suspended until next January for allegedly ripping a swan's head
off.
   Bradley Willis, 19, and Paul Johnson, 20, were arrested
Wednesday and arraigned in 9th District Court on one count each of
killing a protected wild fowl. They pleaded innocent and were
released on $500 bond.
   Matthews said the two admitted to Western Michigan University
police that they were drinking Tuesday before they allegedly killed
the white male swan, which lived with its mate at the Goldsworth
Valley pond on campus. The female and her eggs later were removed.
   The university ordered Willis and Johnson to serve one year's
probation upon their return to school. They were also ordered to
undergo alcohol counseling, make restitution and provide 100 hours
each of community service to Michigan State University's Kellogg
Bird Sanctuary, which owned the bird, university spokesman Michael
Matthews said.
   Johnson, of Rockford, Ill., was a defensive tackle and Willis,
from Rossville, Ill., a linebacker.

<HEAD>Jurors Mark Two-year Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors celebrated with a cake as the McMartin
preschool molestation trial ended its second year, but no one was
rejoicing at the length of the marathon case, which is about to
become Los Angeles' longest trial.
   The number of jurors and alternates has dwindled from the
original 18 to 14 _ 12 regulars and two alternates _ and the judge
has worried aloud that more dropouts could cause a mistrial for
lack of 12 jurors to decide the case.
   When one juror suggested last week that he would have to leave
if his company stops paying his salary, the judge said he might
propose that the county pay the juror's salary to insure completion
of the trial. Jurors in the McMartin trial are paid only $10 a day.
   But paying more would be worth it, the judge indicated, to
ensure that the $15 million already spent on the trial doesn't go
to waste.
   Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62,
are charged with 65 counts of conspiracy and child molestation
involving 11 children who attended the once-prestigious McMartin
Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
   ``I thank you for enduring with us,'' Superior Court Judge
William Pounders told the jurors Thursday. Testimony from 99
witnesses has filled 50,000 transcript pages.
   ``We want to conclude this trial in a reasonable time,'' he
said, ``and we are dedicated to that.''
   He has said he knows jurors are frustrated with the extended
proceedings. In spite of that, they arrived in court with what he
called, ``one of the largest cakes I've ever seen.''
   Next week, the McMartin trial will surpass the record of Los
Angeles' previous longest running trial, the Hillside Strangler
case of Angelo Buono which lasted two years and three days.
   Outside court, prosecution and defense lawyers were in agreement
on one thing _ the trial has lasted too long.
   Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who said she has spent five
years on prosecution of the case, saw the trial's duration as a
flaw in the California criminal justice system.
   ``This is a case that should have been tried over a much shorter
period,'' she said. ``What it shows is that the criminal justice
system in California is slow and unwieldy.
   Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, said, ``The case has dragged on
because it was a non-case whipped up by people who had differing
ambitios that were not in the interest of this institution or the
children.''
   He said he was concerned from the outset that the passage of
time blurred the memories of children who testified.
   ``Whatever the result,'' he predicted, ``We'll never be happy
that we know what happened.''

<TEXT>
   Clashes between leftists and neo-Nazis on the
100th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth left 13 policemen
injured, West Berlin police said today. Authorities said 100 people
were arrested.
   Scattered fighting broke out late Thursday on Hitler's birthday
and went on throughout the city until early today, police said.
   A police statement said about 500 people, mostly young leftists
and foreigners armed with clubs, gas pistols and chains, roamed the
streets looking for neo-Nazi ``skinheads.''
   The ``skinheads,'' recognizable by their shaven heads and black
combat boots, had threatened to harass foreigners and leftists on
Hitler's birthday.
   Thirteen young Germans and Turks clashed with five neo-Nazis
near the city's Congress Hall, police said. Both sides were armed
with clubs and gas pistols. Police arrested all 18 and confiscated
their weapons.
   In another incident, an off-duty policeman sustained facial
injuries when he attempted to arrest two neo-Nazis who were
spray-painting swastika emblems on a building. The officer was able
to arrest one of the men, but the other got away, police spokesman
Jorg Mueller said.
   Police said 12 other officers were slightly injured but provided
no details.
   Mueller said a 16-year-old ``skinhead'' was injured when he was
beaten up by 10 people who attacked him while he was riding in a
subway train.
   Several hundred people in West Berlin's Kreuzburg district,
which has a large foreign population, patroled the area's streets,
Mueller said. Construction trailers parked in the area were
overturned and several windows smashed.
   The skirmishes continued through 4 a.m., when a group of eight
people thought to be from a rightist group attacked a group of four
Germans and four Turks with baseball bats in the Hasenheide area,
Mueller said.
   Police arrested three of the attackers, he said.
   He said a total of 100 people were arrested overnight, and
dozens of weapons, including baseball bats, knives, gas pistols,
and chains, were confiscated.
   Mueller said most of the arrested were freed after
identification checks. ``The majority of those temporarily detained
were from the leftist scene,'' he said.

   Typhoon Andy, packing winds reaching 185 mph,
sent 1,100 people fleeing to shelters and forced the military to
ferry 17 airplanes to Hawaii as a precautionary measure,
authorities said.
   There were no reports of major structural damage or injuries
associated with the storm, according to police officer John
Thornton.
   As of this afternoon, the center of the typhoon with sustained
winds of 155 mph was located 113 miles east-southeast of Guam,
moving to the northeast at 10 mph, the Joint Typhoon Weather Center
said.
   The typhoon was expected to head into the Northern Mariana
Islands, bypassing Rota by 115 miles, before missing Tinian and the
capital city of Saipan by 155 miles, the center said.
   Guam, a U.S. territory with a population of 105,000, is the
largest of the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific.
   Earlier today, Guam was hit with 50 mph winds and gusts to 65
mph that knocked out 15 percent of the island's electric power for
a few hours.
   Thornton described the weather as ``not too bad.'' He said,
``You feel it in small cars when you're driving.''
   However, the island's banana and mango crops were hard hit, Guam
Cablevision reported.
   About half of the U.S. territory's schools were being used as
shelters, Thornton said.

<HEAD>Court Says Russian Roulette Victim Shouldn't Get Benefits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The family of a police officer who shot and
killed himself during a game of Russian roulette doesn't deserve
$161 a week in workers' compensation benefits, a state appeals
court ruled.
   The Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court on Thursday
overturned a decision by the state Workers' Compensation Board
awarding the family of Timothy Gibbs benefits because he wasn't
fully trained in how to use his gun.
   ``One does not need intensive experience in weapons firing to
become familiar with the deadly risks of playing Russian
roulette,'' Justice Howard Levine said.
   Gibbs was hired as an Orange County deputy sheriff to provide
extra security at a 1983 trial. He was standing lookout on the roof
of a jail.
   When another officer arrived to relieve Gibbs, the pair emptied
ammunition from their guns, and Gibbs said to his companion,
``Let's play Russian roulette,'' Levine said.
   Gibbs put a shell into his .357-caliber Magnum, spun it and put
the gun to his head. He pulled the trigger and was killed.

<TEXT>
   The 16-inch guns on the USS Iowa, which can lob
a shell the weight of a Volkswagen 23 miles, have an outdated
design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age, critics say.
   ``They're old-fashioned and inherently dangerous. They all ought
to be eliminated,'' retired Rear Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Center
for Defense Information said Thursday. ``I don't know what more it
takes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is no
longer appropriate on warships.''
   But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use on
any ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboard
the battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target
practice.
   ``This gun ... remains the finest naval gun in the world. It was
the pinnacle of gun design art, and it is still a front-line
system,'' said Capt. Larry Seaquist, commander of the Iowa until
last May.
   The main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed
in silk bags to fire 16-inch-diameter shells from its 62-foot-long
barrel. It works like the breech-loaded guns that roared during the
Civil War: A shell is placed into a barrel and then charged with
gunpowder in a separate package.
   In the Iowa's case, 660 pounds of powder _ six 110-pound bags _
is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to 2,700 pounds at a
speed of 2,500 feet per second. An electric spark ignites the
powder.
   The extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during the
burst, but some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases can
build up in the barrel. Air pressurized to 3,000 pounds per square
inch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guard
against a ``blowback,'' which happens when powder ignites before
the breech is closed.
   In newer guns, powder is packed in metal containers. Missiles,
the backbone of the modern Navy's attack capability, have
integrated propellants.
   Capt. James Bush of the Center for Defense Information, a
private think tank often critical of Pentagon policy, said the Iowa
explosion could have been caused by smoldering debris, a blowback
or a mishap in the handling of powder.
   ``It wasn't unexpected. It wasn't a surprise. This is dangerous
technology. It's archaic,'' Bush said. ``These are the only guns in
the Navy that still used bagged powder.''
   The Navy said Thursday that none of the guns in the Iowa turret
had been fired before the explosion took place.
   The Navy also on Thursday placed a moratorium on firing the big
guns, found only on the Iowa and its three sister battleships, the
New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.
   In a larger sense, critics say the battleships themselves, once
the mainstay of gunboat diplomacy, have outlived their purpose.
   Despite 16-inch-thick armor plating, the battlewagons are
vulnerable to submarine and missile attack. The 20-mile range of
the 16-inch guns is almost worthless in an era when missiles can be
fired at much greater distances.
   ``We can do almost anything with a missile and do it better,''
Bush said.
   Battleships reached their heyday in World War I and were
intended to fight other ships.
   The Iowa, first launched in 1942, was the first of an entire
class of U.S. battlewagons built to conquer Japan.
   It supported Marine amphibious landings and shelled shore
targets, but the aircraft carrier emerged as the Navy's top weapon
because naval battles were waged without ships ever seeing each
other. The Iowa also fought off Korea.
   The Iowa and three sister warships were ordered out of mothballs
in the Reagan administration's military buildup six years ago. They
were upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missiles, 20mm guns and Harpoon
missiles.
   One of the battleships, the New Jersey, bombarded Syrian and
Druze positions in Lebanon as part the U.S. peacekeeping role in
1983. But the 16-inch guns often missed their targets, which the
Navy blamed on unreliable powder from World War II.
   ``There was no military need to return these ships to active
duty,'' said the CDI's LaRocque. ``Their only military utility is
to bombard Third World countries, and the era of gunboat diplomacy
is over.''

<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The occult-obsessed leader of a drug
ring that police believe made human sacrifices of at least 15
people didn't allow his henchmen to use drugs themselves,
authorities said.
   ``He killed one of them because he used cocaine,'' said Juan
Benitez Ayala, head of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police in
Matamoros.
   The leader, Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, is the object of a
manhunt stretching from the Texas border to South America and he
remained at large today, a day after he and 10 others were indicted
by a U.S. federal grand jury in McAllen, Texas, on drug-trafficking
charges.
   ``He did not take drugs,'' Benitez said. ``He drinks, but he
doesn't take drugs. Not one (in his organization) is a drug user.''
   Benitez said defendants who have admitted smuggling drugs for
Constanzo told police he required them to stay away from the
cocaine and marijuana in which they trafficked.
   Benitez identified the man killed for breaking that rule as
Jorge Valente del Fierro Gomez, 35.
   Many of the 15 bodies exhumed near Matamoros last week were
mutilated in rituals designed to bring magical protection for the
drug-smuggling business, according to confessions from those
arrested in the case.
   One of the victims has been identified as an American college
student.
   Police know of at least 11 members of the Constanzo group in
Matamoros and an unknown number in other parts of Mexico and
possibly other countries, including the United States, Benitez said.
   Constanzo is believed to be with Martin Quintana Rodriguez and
Alvaro de Leon Valdez, Benitez said. U.S. officials have confirmed
that Constanzo flew to Mexico City with two other men April 11, the
day police began finding bodies at a remote ranch 20 miles west of
Matamoros.
   Quintana's sister, Maria Teresa, a reported occult practitioner,
was arrested earlier this week in Mexico City in connection with
the case.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Selections from Alexander Solzhenitsyn's banned
chronicle of Stalin's labor camps, ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' will
be published this year by a literary journal, a secretary at the
magazine said today.
   Some chapters from the lengthy book will appear before year's
end in the monthly magazine Novy Mir, Valentina Ivanovna said in a
telephone interview.
   The secretary refused to say who in the Soviet leadership had
approved publication of the gripping tale of repression under
Stalin. Kremlin officials have said such works still are off limits.
   ``I am against the publication of a number works by
Solzhenitsyn, and in the first place such works as `Lenin in
Zurich' and `The Gulag Archipelago,''' Communist Party ideology
chief Vadim A. Medvedev told a news conference in November.
Exposing Soviets to such books would undermine society, he said.
   But The Washington Post in today's editions quoted Novy Mir's
chief editor, Sergei P. Zalygin, as saying in an interview that
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev supported publication of
Solzhenitsyn's works. Ms. Ivanovna said Zalygin would not be in his
office and was immediately unreachable.
   It was Novy Mir that published Solzhenitsyn's short novel, ``One
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' in November 1962.
   The Gulag is a triology that maintains widescale political
repression began in the Soviet Union under founder Vladimir I.
Lenin.
   Zalygin had said last year he was negotiating for the rights to
print Solzhenitsyn's novel ``Cancer Ward.'' Ms. Ivanovna said no
decision had been made about publishing works of Solzhenitsyn other
than the Gulag.
   Several writers, artists and activists have clamored for
publication of Solzhenitsyn's works, citing Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, which among other things allows re-examination of sore
points in Soviet history like Stalin's reign of terror.
   In February, a journal of the Soviet Peace Committee titled
Twentieth Century and Peace printed an appeal to reject officially
sanctioned lies that Solzhenitsyn wrote just before being exiled in
1974. The journal also carried a commentary crediting Solzhenitsyn
for helping pave the way for Gorbachev's reforms.
   The reforms have led to publication of Soviet authors that had
been long banned. Others that have come into the open include the
novel ``Doctor Zhivago'' by Boris Pasternak and the political
satire ``Heart of a Dog'' by Mikhail Bulgakov.
   Solzhenitsyn was arrested, branded a traitor and expelled for
his writings.
   Solzhenitsyn, 70, gained U.S. citizenship in 1974. A Nobel
laureate, he is living in rural isolation in Vermont.

<TEXT>
   A bill legalizing floating casinos on
rivers and lakes in Iowa is on its way to Gov. Terry Branstad, who
has pledged to sign it into law as a way of bolstering the state's
economy.
   The House voted 51-47 Thursday to approve the measure, without a
vote to spare in reaching the required majority of the 100-member
body.
   Rep. Phil Tyrrell, a Republican, was among opponents who
predicted dire consequences, saying gambling would not be confined
long to rivers and lakes.
   ``Like a sickness and a disease, it spreads across the state of
Iowa,'' said Tyrrell. ``We'll see all of the problems that follow,
the drugs and the prostitution, as if Iowa didn't have enough
problems.''
   Critics complained bitterly about intense lobbying pressure to
reverse last week's rejection of the same bill by three votes.
   Rep. Greg Spenner, a Republican who voted against the bill last
week, said before the vote that he would switch sides because his
phone had not stopped ringing.
   ``The people in my district are in apparent disagreement with my
earlier stance,'' said Spenner.
   Backers said eastern Iowa badly needs multimillion-dollar
developments that have been proposed for the Iowa side of the
Mississippi River in association with casino boats. Besides, they
said, the state already has pari-mutuel betting, bingo and a
lottery, so gambling is nothing new.
   ``It's hypocritical for us to deny another part of the state
their form of gambling,'' said Rep. Mark Haverland, a Democrat who
is a United Methodist minister.
   ``I do not think gambling is a sin. I think gambling is dumb and
self-destructive,'' he said. ``But I don't think gambling is the
only thing that's legal, dumb and self-destructive.''
   ``We continue to delude ourselves into thinking that somehow we

said Rep. Tom Miller, a Republican.
   Backers painted a picture of 19th century riverboats plying the

entertainment.
   Developer Franklin Fried of San Diego issued a statement
immediately after the vote saying, ``Iowa has laid the foundation
for bringing a unique first-class national tourist attraction to
the Midwest.'' He promised to move ahead with plans for a $10
million Iowa Queen riverboat.
   Under the bill, the state's Racing Commission would issue
gambling licenses for boats on rivers and lakes, with the
commission setting the location and number.
   The bill legalizes small stakes gambling, with a $5 limit per
bet and a $200 nightly loss limit. The first boatload of gamblers
could sail in 1991.

   A strong earthquake struck a remote, mountainous

casualties or damage.
   The quake measured 8.9 on the 12-point Soviet scale, and its
epicenter was located in the mountains of southwestern Yakutia,
Tass said.
   An 8 point earthquake is considered ``destructive'' on the
Soviet scale, but the area is remote and seismographs in the
regional capital, Yakutsk, 2,700 miles east of Moscow, recorded the
quake at at only 2.3 points, Tass said.
   The Soviet news agency said it had received no reports of

   Singer John Denver walked away,
apparently uninjured, after a 1931 biplane he was piloting got into
an accident while taxiing at an airport, authorities said.
   The plane landed in northern Arizona Thursday afternoon for
refueling on a flight from Carefree, Ariz., to Santa Fe, N.M., with
only Denver aboard, police and Federal Aviation Administration
officials said.
   An FAA duty officer in Los Angeles, who would not give his name,
said he understood Denver's Waco biplane spun around horizontally,
possibly after being blown by a gust of wind after landing. He
didn't know details of the damage.
   Denver left on another plane without seeking medical attention,
police spokeswoman Mary Benavidez said.
   Denver, a licensed jet pilot, activist and entertainer who lives
in Aspen, Colo., spends much of his time working for the Windstar
Foundation. He established the foundation in 1976 to promote
environmentally sound approaches to energy and food production.
   Denver, 45, rose to popularity in the 1970s with such hits as

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian forces today bombarded the
Christian enclave with rockets, concentrating their attacks on the
port of Jounieh in an apparent effort to block the Christians' only
route out of Lebanon.
   Police had no immediate reports of casualties.
   Syrian gunners in Moslem west Beirut fired truck-mounted BM-21
rocket launchers that shot 40 122mm rockets carrying 105-pound
warheads.
   A police spokesman said the Syrians fired every four hours on
Jounieh and the coastal highway running north from Beirut in the
Christians' crescent-shaped, 310-square-mile enclave.
   Christian forces did not return the fire, police said, but
Moslems in west Beirut continued to flee the city.
   Kuwait's Al-Qabas daily newspaper said several Arab states were
seeking to persuade Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, to
accept a peacekeeping force. It said the Arab force could number
``several hundred officers and troops from six or seven Arab
states.'' It did not name them.
   The rocketing flared after a short lull Wednesday in the battle
between Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian army units and an
alliance of Syrians and Moslem Druse militiamen.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, described the missile barrage as ``a message'' that a
ferry service linking Jounieh with Larnaca, Cyprus, ``should not
resume.''
   The Cypriot companies that run two ferries into Jounieh
suspended service two days ago after their vessels came under
Moslem rocket fire. They have carried about 12,000 Christians and
foreigners to Cyprus in recent weeks.
   However, Cypriot officials in Larnaca said one of the ferries
sailed for Jounieh today. Because of the shelling, the ferries have
anchored 10 miles offshore and fleeing Christians are shuttled out
to the ships in small boats.
   Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib, commander of Moslem units of Lebanon's
divided army, said Jounieh and Beirut ports would ``remain under
blockade'' as long as Aoun maintains his siege of illegal ports
south of Beirut run by Moslem militias.
   Aoun's blockade, in a move aimed at restoring government control
long eroded by the powerful militias, led to the latest round of
fighting in Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
   Since March 8, at least 270 people, mainly civilians, have been
killed and nearly 1,000 wounded.
   About 150,000 Moslems have fled Beirut, many out of fear of
renewed fighting. Others have left because of shortages of flour
and fuel, power blackouts and the breakdown of the water system.
   But many Moslem men have stayed to look after homes and
businesses.
   ``I'm prepared to live in an underground shelter for the rest of
my life, but I won't leave my shop or apartment to be looted,''
said Izzat Salam, a Sunni Moslem spare parts dealer who has sent
his family to Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   Police reported numerous complaints about robberies in
bomb-damaged apartments, shops and warehouses.
   Meanwhile, about 400 Christians demonstrated in the Jdaideh
suburb of east Beirut to support Aoun's ``war of liberation'' to
force Syria to withdraw its 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
   A spokesman for the demonstrators, who refused to be identified,
said they planned to stage a sit-in near the U.S. Embassy in east
Beirut to ``demand U.S. action to save Lebanon and rid it of the
Syrian occupation.''
   Lebanese guards outside the embassy fired in the air on Thursday
to stop demonstrators jumping over a barbed wire fence to get into
the U.S. compound, police said.
   The spokesman said six demonstrators ``fell on the barbed wire
fence and suffered injuries.''
   Aoun accused Washington of failing to mobilize Western pressure
on Syria to stop the fighting. U.S. officials have said Washington
has little influence with the Syrians.
   In Geneva, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar today
called on all countries to provide humanitarian asssistance to
Lebanon and said immediate needs totaled $92 million.
   ``The needs of humanitarian assistance for the most disfavored
population groups _ the wounded, the disabled, the displaced, and
the very poor _ are greater than ever,'' he said in a statement.

<HEAD>Air And Road Convoys Leave Uganda For Southern Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations began trucking and
airlifting food to the southern Sudanese town of Torit today, three
days after an ambush halted the relief effort's first convoy to the
beleaguered town.
   The airlift and convoy are part of the United Nations' Operation
Lifelife Sudan, meant to stock more than 110,000 tons of food and
supplies in war-torn southern Sudan before heavy seasonal rains
begin in mid-May.
   The $132 million operation aims to prevent a repeat of 1988's
tragedy when between 250,000 and 500,000 people died because of a
famine caused by drought, floods and the 6-year-old insurgency by
the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   A giant C-130 Hercules cargo plane carrying 155 tons of maize
landed in Torit after leaving Uganda's Entebbe airport before dawn,
said Paul Mitchell, a spokesman for Operation Lifeline Sudan.
   The plane, leased from and operated by the Miami-based Southern
Air Transport Co., is to make three flights daily to Torit until it
has delivered 1,100 tons, he said.
   Mitchell said today's delivery was the first large shipment of
relief food to the town. The Norwegian People's Aid and World
Vision relief agencies have delivered 100 tons of food to Torit
since April 1, he said.
   Gote Hertz, a U.N. spokesman in Kampala, said a 47-truck convoy
carrying 1,100 tons of food also started off today. He said the
convoy first will deliver food to the Sudanese border town of
Nimule, then travel 60 miles northeast to Torit if the convoy
leaders believe conditions are safe.
   In recent weeks, Torit's civilian population has swelled from
3,000 to 25,000 as displaced southerners seeking food and shelter
pour in from the surrounding bush. U.N. officials expect the
population to climb to 50,000 in the coming weeks.
   On Tuesday, the first U.N. convoy in rebel-held southern Sudan
was ambushed as it traveled west to Torit from the Sudan People's
Liberation base of Kapoeta. Eight rebel escorts were killed, and
the convoy's lead truck was destroyed. U.N. officials have not
assessed blame for the attack.
   Operation Lifeline began April 1 after the United Nations
received assurances from Sudan's government in Khartoum and the
rebels that the relief effort would be allowed to move unhampered.
   U.N. officials say they probably will not meet their goal of
delivering 115,000 tons of food to southern Sudan before the onset
of the rainy season.
   The rebels seek greater autonomy and economic development for
the predominantly Christian and animist south.

<TEXT>
   South Africa said today that all its
security forces in Namibia will be confined to their bases for 60
hours next week to allow guerrillas to withdraw to Angola without
threat of confrontation.
   South Africa's foreign minister, Pik Botha, said the security
forces would remain at their bases in northern Namibia from 6 p.m.
Wednesday until 6 a.m. the following Saturday.
   His announcement came after reports of new fighting between the
South African-led security forces and guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization.
   ``South Africa gives the assurance that SWAPO infiltrators will
be allowed unhindered to return to Angola during the period in
question,'' Botha said in a statement released in the South African
capital, Pretoria.
   He did not say what South Africa would do if SWAPO fighters
remained in Namibia after April 29.
   South Africa says 1,600 guerrillas crossed into Namibia from
neighboring Angola after April 1, in violation of a December peace
accord that required them to remain at bases in Angola until
mid-May.
   Since then, more than 280 guerrillas and 27 members of the
security forces have been killed in fighting in northern Namibia,
territorial officials said. Most of the fighting occurred in the
first week of April, but officials said three SWAPO guerrillas were
killed Thursday in clashes.
   Col. Richard Warren, commander of the Australian U.N. military
forces in northern Namibia, said the clash occurred about 25 miles
southeast of a military airbase at Ondangwa.
   South Africa says 400 guerrillas have withdrawn to Angola, 32
have been captured and 900 remain in the territory.
   U.N. forces in northern Namibia have set up assembly points
where the guerrillas can report and be given safe passage to
Angola. However, only 12 insurgents have turned up.
   Botha said the decision to confine the security forces to their
bases was made following a meeting Thursday between officials from
South Africa, Angola, and Cuba, the signatories of a December
regional peace accord that cleared the way for Namibia's
independence from South Africa.
   The three countries agreed that SWAPO forces should return to
bases at least 100 miles inside Angola, he said.
   The head of the U.N. operation in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, has
defended his decision to allow South African soldiers to leave
their bases and combat the insurgents. Ahtisaari said if he had
tried to keep South African forces at their bases, ``instead of 300
dead, which is very unfortunate, we would have seen a massacre ...
and the end'' of the independence plan.
   SWAPO has been fighting South African rule since 1966. South
Africa agreed to implement independence in Namibia under a treaty
that calls for Cuba to withdraw its 50,000 soldiers from Angola.

   Hundreds of radical students yelling
``Down with dictatorship!'' battled riot police with firebombs and
rocks in at least three cities today after rallies demanding the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Several thousand radical students took part in fierce clashes at
four major colleges in Seoul, surging out of the campuses to attack
riot police who fired volleys of tear gas and hurled rocks back at
the protesters.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Yankee go home!'' the students
yelled as they beat drums and brass gongs in the third day of
serious campus protests in Seoul and other cities.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said hundreds of students
also clashed with police in the southeastern cities of Kwangju and
Iri.
   Police officials said there had been some injuries, but they had
no figures on injuries or arrests.
   The Defense Ministry announced earlier today it would mobilize
up to 80,000 military technicians to keep key industries running if
workers go on strike. The government has warned that growing labor
unrest could cause major economic damage and foment unrest.
   Students staged protests at colleges in Seoul to support labor
strikes and demand the overthrow of the conservative Roh
government. Student leaders called for a major drive by opposition
groups to oust Roh.
   More than 1,000 students hurling hundreds of firebombs and rocks
battled riot police for more than two hours in the streets around
Konkuk University in eastern Seoul. Police trucks with multiple
tear gas launchers repeatedly fired barrages of choking gas to
drive the protesters back onto the campus.
   Police battled about 1,000 students at Hankook University who
charged out wielding iron pipes and wooden clubs and hurling
firebombs. Similar clashes were reported by college officials at
Seoul National and Yonsei universities.
   The students claim the Roh government is a front for military
rule and are calling for a popular uprising to topple the
administration. But the radicals and allied dissident groups lack
popular support because of their violence and extreme views.
   The students are not seen as a serious threat to the government,
even though they have been staging almost daily violent protests.
   Roh and other government leaders are worried about the radicals'
efforts to build an alliance with militant trade unions that have
been staging strikes for higher pay and better working conditions.
The government says strikes in recent months have cost the economy
$2 billion in lost production.
   The Defense Ministry statement today said it would use military
engineers and other technicians to keep vital industries running if
hit by strikes. The government said earlier this week that it would
use troops to keep important industries operating.

   Police deployed extra officers today near the
Al Aqsa Mosque in Arab east Jerusalem, and soldiers turned back
Palestinians trying to enter the city for prayer services at the
holy site.
   Moslem officials had called on Palestinians from the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip to attend the services despite Israeli
efforts to restrict the number of worshipers as a way to prevent
violence.
   Also today, the army announced that a 17-year-old Palestinian
from the Gaza Strip was killed Thursday when he was struck by
plastic bullets during a clash with army troops.
   The death brought to 440 the number of Palestinians killed since
the December 1987 start of the uprising against Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza. Eighteen Israelis also have died in the
unrest.
   Since capturing the Old City from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war, Israel has taken pride in guaranteeing free access to all
religious sites. Authorities, however, occasionally have blocked
traffic from the occupied areas during the 16-month Palestinian
uprising to prevent riots at Moslem prayers.
   ``When it comes to violence, there's a need to restrict
movement,'' said a senior military official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Police and army roadblocks were set up today along the roads
linking Jerusalem with the West Bank. Troops stopped and searched
Arab-owned cars and pulled passengers off Arab buses. Young men
were ordered to go back while elderly people were allowed to
continue on their way to Jerusalem.
   On the road from the biblical West Bank towns of Hebron and
Bethlehem, 10 Arab men were turned back just as a group of 50 armed
Jewish settlers, accompanied by police and army cars, marched by,
singing religious songs.
   ``This is ... to show that Jews can walk throughout the land of
Israel without fear, that this is our country,'' said 36-year-old
Mark Zell from Alon Shvut settlement, a lawyer who immigrated to
Israel from Washington.
   But Jamal, a 35-year-old Palestinian who watched the settlers
pass, noted: ``They want to show us this is their land, but they
have to carry all these guns. It shows that they are afraid of
us.'' He declined to give his full name.
   In Jerusalem, hundreds of security personnel were deployed
around Al Aqsa's hilltop site, compared to the usual 90.
   Police were searching grocery bags and checking identity cards
of all Arabs asking to enter the compound, turning back all
residents of the occupied West Bank. Those allowed to enter turned
over their identity cards to police.
   Below the mosque, about 300 Jewish worshipers were seen praying
at the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism which Jews believe
is the last remnant of their ancient temple.
   Jerusalem police commander Yosef Yehudai told reporters Moslem
prayers were attended by 14,000 worshipers. Israel army radio
estimated the number at 5,500.
   Moslem worshipers dispersed without incident, and Yehudai said
it was ``because of all the measures police and border police
made.''
   Security was tightened after Palestinians stoned police in the
mosque compound following prayers on April 7, the first Friday of
the Moslem holy month of Ramadan. The violence spread to the
adjacent Western Wall.
   On April 14, police turned away most West Bank and Gaza
Palestinians headed for the mosque, the third-holiest site of Islam
after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.

   A pack of youths descended on Central Park,
attacking three people including a 28-year-old jogger who was raped
and beaten into unconsciousness, police said.
   The woman was found by passersby about 1:30 a.m. Thursday
bleeding badly, her skull fractured, wearing only a bra and
suffering from hypothermia, said Chief of Detectives Robert
Colangelo. She was hospitalized in critical condition today.
   Co-workers described the woman as a Wall Street investment
banker who worked long hours and regularly jogged alone at night.
   ``The youths were in the park, and this was a crime of
opportunity,'' said Colangelo. ``They saw the woman, and it was
spontaneous.''
   Nobody was arrested on rape charges, but five youths were
charged in an earlier attack and robbery of a man walking home
through the park, said a police spokesman, Detective Joseph
McConville. Police were searching for as many as seven others, all
between the ages of 13 and 15, Colangelo said.
   Colangelo said evidence indicated the woman fought desperately
against at least a dozen assailants. A bloodied rock which police
believe was used in the attack was found near the battered woman,
he said.
   He said police believe youngsters who knew each other but were
not in a gang arrived in the park around 10 p.m., bent on starting
trouble. They tossed rocks at a passing taxi and assaulted another
woman after the rape, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School officials across the country are being
advised to test for radon after the federal government found
unhealthy levels of the odorless, cancer-causing gas in half the
schools examined in spot checks from Maine to Washington state.
   ``Based on measurements taken in 3,000 schoolrooms in 16 states,
it appears that elevated levels of radon gas can be found in
schools throughout the United States,'' EPA Administrator William
K. Reilly said Thursday.
   He called indoor radon, which is emitted from natural
radioactive decay in the ground, ``one of the major environmental
health threats facing Americans'' and urged that officials
nationwide test their schoolrooms for the gas.
   The testing, he said today on ``CBS This Morning,'' would cost
``anywhere from $5 to $25 for a room. And if it turns out there's a
problem, the costs of doing something about it are not very high.
They're in the range of $500 to $10,000 maximum.''
   The EPA, which last year issued a similar warning to homeowners
after a spot check around the country, said that of 130 public
schools tested in 41 communities, 54 percent of the schools had at
least one room normally occupied by students or staff that
registered unhealthy levels of radon.
   The agency has said that any level of 4 picocuries per liter of
air should be considered unhealthy and warrant additional tests and
likely corrective action. In schools in five of the states the
level was 20 picocuries or more and in a school in Tennessee it was
found to be 136 picocuries.
   By comparison, federal standards for uranium mining call for
miners to wear protective equipment when radiation levels are 16 to
20 picocuries per liter of air during continuous work periods, said
Richard Guimond, the EPA's director of radiation programs,
   EPA spokeswoman Martha Casey said no list of the schools tested
was immediately available, but affected state authorities and
school officials in the 41 communities have been told of the test
results.
   In California, State Health Services Director Kenneth Kizer said
the national advisory is based on weak scientific evidence and will
result in unfounded fears, will further erode confidence in
government, and waste money.
   There is no federal law requiring tests for radon, although
Congress enacted a law last year requiring the EPA to study the
extent of radon contamination in schools. Congress has yet to
provide the $1.5 million for the program, however, said Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., a sponsor of the legislation.
   ``These very preliminary findings show that radon may be a more
serious health problem in our schools than we originally thought _
that it may be as serious as asbestos or lead in drinking water,''
said Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., chairman of the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee.
   The EPA estimates that over a lifetime regular exposure to 4
picocuries of radon is equivalent to smoking a half pack of
cigarettes a day. Scientists have estimated that radon may cause up
to 20,000 lung cancer deaths a year, second only to fatalities
caused by smoking.
   Actual exposure of children to radon in schools is difficult to
determine from the incomplete EPA tests since levels can range
widely from school to school and even among rooms in the same
school, according to agency officials.
   Guimond estimated in an interview that from the data obtained
from the tests in the 130 schools, it is likely that students in as
many as 10 percent of the nation's schools could be exposed to
unhealthy radon levels on a regular basis.
   Of the 3,000 schoolrooms tested, 19 percent had levels of 4
picocuries or more. About 3 percent, or 101 classrooms in six
states, had levels of at least 20 picocuries, including 77
schoolrooms in Nashville, enn., area where the highest level _ 136
picocuries _ also was found.
   Especially high levels also were found in schools in Butte,
Mont., 51 picocuries; Los Alamos, N.M., 41 picocuries; and the
Spokane, Wash., area, 98 picocuries, according to the EPA.
   Guimond said such levels ``are not that unique'' at schools
located in areas where significant radon is present in the ground
and where ventilation systems often suck radon into buildings.
``When these two things occur, you're going to get those high
levels,'' he said.
   The other states in which schools were tested were Nevada,
Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri,
Illinois, Indiana, Georgia and New Jersey.
   According to the agency, unhealthy radon levels also have been
found in previous tests in schools in Virginia, Florida, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and Iowa. Those findings were not
part of the latest study and no additional information was
available.
   Radon, which is colorless, odorless and tasteless, is the
product of the natural radioactive decay of Radium-226 in the soil
and rocks. It normally poses no health concerns outdoors where
typical levels are in the 0.2 to 0.7 picocurie range. The higher
concentrations occur in buildings where the gas is trapped and
accumulates.

<HEAD>Last South African Hunger Striker Resumes Eating</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last participant in a
hunger strike has resumed eating, ending a protest that helped win
freedom for hundreds of black inmates who were held without charge,
a human rights group said today.
   The Human Rights Commission said the last known hunger striker,
Zelile Zwane, began eating Thursday after being taken to court and
charged with various offenses, including illegal weapons possession
and attempted murder.
   Like the other hunger strikers, many of them anti-apartheid
activists held since 1986, he had demanded the government either
release him or charge him.
   The government said this week that less than 100 people remained
in custody under emergency regulations allowing indefinite
detention without trial. About 1,000 were held in late January,
when hundreds of detainees began fasting in prisons across the
country.
   ``We see what happened as a great victory for detainees,'' said
Audrey Coleman, a member of the Human Rights Commission. ``Through
their united action, they were able to expose the whole system of
detention without trial.''
   However, the commission and civil rights lawyers issued angry
protests today because of reports that former hunger strikers had
been shackled to their beds while recuperating at Johannesburg
Hospital.
   The National Medical and Dental Association, an organization of
anti-apartheid health care professionals, said Thursday that at
least two detainees had been shackled to prevent escapes. Since
September, there have been at least four escapes from hospitals by
detainees receiving treatment.
   Police headquarters declined comment on the use of shackles at
the hospital but said departmental policy allowed such measures.
   The Human Rights Commission says a majority of detainees freed
in recent weeks have been issued with restriction orders. Many of
them are barred from certain political activities, confined to
their homes at night and required to report to a police station
twice daily.
   One former detainee, Chris Ntuli, was killed by unidentified
assailants last week after making his required appearance at a
police station in a black shantytown outside Durban. Civil rights
groups suggested the killers were right-wing vigilantes who were
able to predict Ntuli's movements because of the restrictions.
   Black activists in the Durban area today called for residents to
stay away from work and school in conjunction with a memorial
service for Ntuli. There were unconfirmed reports that two buses
were fire-bombed and that a milk truck was set on fire, killing the
driver.
   The Weekly Mail, a leading anti-apartheid newspaper, reported
today that the decision to free most detainees was made by the
Cabinet against the wishes of the State Security Council, which
includes senior military and intelligence officials as well as a
few Cabinet ministers.
   The Weekly Mail quoted Mark Swilling, a Johannesburg-based
political scientist, as saying it was the first time the security
council was overruled in the 11 years since President P.W. Botha
took power.

<HEAD>American Labor Chiefs Say Soviets Ruled Out Independent Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two American labor leaders said today that Soviet
officials admitted their trade unions have not adequately protected
workers but ruled out formation of independent trade organizations.
   However, the leaders, AFL-CIO vice presidents Jack Sheinkman and
William Winpisinger, told a news conference they believe such
independent unions, like Poland's Solidarity, might surface.
   ``If steps are not taken to adequately reflect representation
and problems that the workers are putting to their leadership, that
kind of pressure might ultimately explode,'' Sheinkman said. He is
president of the New York-based Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union.
   One of the tenets of communism is that workers' rights are a top
priority of the government, but trade unions have come under
increasing criticism for not aggressively prodding bureaucrats to
improve housing, salaries and working conditions.
   At least two strikes by Soviet miners have been reported this
year over low salaries and poor working conditions.
   Sheinkman said he asked Stepan A. Shalayev, president of the
All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, on Monday whether
independent trade unions would be created in the Soviet Union.
   ``This was not what they felt was necessary. ... Pluralism as
defined by him in our conversations meant pluralism within the
existing system and framework and not in terms of an independent
union such as exists in Poland,'' the American labor chief said.
   But he said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms could lead
to such unions because the government will not ``be able to put the
necessary checks on everything.''
   Earlier this month, Poland's government ended seven years of
suppression and legalized the trade union Solidarity.
   Winpisinger, president of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said he believes Gorbachev, whom
he met Wednesday, is aware of the faults of Soviet trade unions.
   Gennady Yanayev, a secretary of the Soviet trade unioncouncil,
told the news conference that officially backed trade unions have
not paid enough attention to the social and economic needs of
workers but that improvements are under way.
   ``We are confident the unions will be made an even more dynamic
and efficient force, and given that I think there will be no
question of the need for alternative groups,'' Yanayev said.
   ``But,'' he added, ``life will show.''

<HEAD>Detroit Catholic Churches Fight Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen Roman Catholic churches that have been
ordered closed filed grievances with the Archdiocese of Detroit,
charging that church officials' decision to shut down 30 inner-city
churches was racist.
   The grievances, filed Thursday, call for an independent church
review of the closings announced by Cardinal Edmund Szoka in
January after five years' study. The churches were ordered to close
by June 30 because of dwindling membership and the expense of
maintaining obsolete buildings.
   Three churches that aren't scheduled to close also filed
grievances in sympathy for the others.
   The grievances charge that Szoka, Bishop Patrick Cooney and
members of two committees that recommended the closings showed a
lack of love for the city's black Catholics.
   They ``willingly accept the premise that white suburban
Catholics would not involve themselves in the church in the city
for reasons of racism, fear of crime and overall lack of love for
their urban brothers and sisters,'' the documents state.
   The Rev. Norman Nawrocki, the archdiocese's grievance clerk, has
20 days to decide whether the grievances fit the archdiocese's
guidelines for disputes. If they do, they will be heard by a
grievance committee that can make a recommendation to the cardinal,
said Jay Berman, a spokesman for the archdiocese.
   Berman, who called the charges in the grievances ``harsh and
very unfair,'' said however that only the cardinal can overturn his
own decisions about the churches.
   Berman also said there could be an appeal directly to the
Vatican, but most of the parishes filed that appeal earlier, before
filing this one, and to his knowledge there has been no response.

<HEAD>`Alert' Condor Chick Takes First Feeding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newborn California condor chick gobbled down
its first meal of minced mice and egg yolk and was pronounced alert
and healthy by its anxious keepers.
   An eyedropper was used Thursday to give the bird its first meal,
said Tom Hanscom, spokesman for the San Diego Wild Animal Park. The
bird, hatched Wednesday, is the second California condor to be
conceived and produced in captivity and the 29th known member of
the critically endangered species.
   The initial feeding was withheld until Thursday to give the
chick, named Mandan, time to rest and build an appetite while being
monitored by keepers for signs of a working digestive system.
   ``It gobbled it down. It did so well with the first feeding that
it took two minced mice'' about an hour later, Hanscom said. ``The
chick is alert and active and gives every appearance of a healthy
baby condor.''
   The 6.9-ounce chick was named after an Indian tribe native to
the eastern Rockies where condors lived hundreds of years ago. It
is the offspring of the same condor couple that produced Molloko,
the year-old condor that was the first of the species conceived and
born in captivity.
   Mandan's sex will be determined in several weeks when it's
strong enough to undergo a blood test. Its hatching gives hope for
the future of North America's largest land birds, which have
wingspans up to 9{ feet, Hanscom said.
   Three other fertile condor eggs incubating at the park are
expected to hatch at various times within the next six weeks.
   All California condors known to exist are in the state's two
condor breeding stations. Fifteen birds are at the Wild Animal Park
and 14 at the Los Angeles Zoo.

<HEAD>Wright Says Ethics Committee Deliberately Slowing Pace</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 8-9, Poll results, with poll results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright says the House ethics
committee and its chief investigator are dragging their feet in
granting Wright an opportunity to defend himself personally against
69 alleged rues violations.
   The ethics panel, meanwhile, is investigating yet another
investment deal that yielded huge profits for Wright and could
yield new ethics headaches as well.
   Committee members will travel to Texas next week to interview
businessmen who helped Wright's investment partnership parlay a
$9,120 investment into a $440,000 return in a short period last
year.
   Published reports on Thursday indicated the businessmen has an
interest in selling jet trainers to the Air Force. A key question
before the ethics committee is whether Wright received favors from
people with a direct interest in legislation.
   Wright said Thursday he has met requirements to move to the next
phase of his case, a chance for him to confront the ethics
committee and seek to rebut the allegations of failure to report
gifts, accepting gifts from someone with an interest in legislation
and evading outside income limits through bulk sales of a book he
wrote.
   He particularly blamed the committee's special outside counsel,
Richard J. Phelan, for what he termed the delay. ``I'm puzzled as
to why he is dragging his feet,'' Wright told a reporter. ``We're
very anxious to have the matter resolved as soon as possible.''
   And he added, ``It's a little bit distracting that I write
letters to the chairman and ranking minority member of the
committee and get a reply from Mr. Phelan, and it's always some
foot dragging. I'm anxious to let them ask me questions.''
   Poll results published today indicated Americans strongly
believe Wright should step down as speaker if the House ultimately
finds him guilty of rules violations. A Wall Street Journal-NBC
News poll of 1,447 adults last weekend found 75 percent holding
that view, while just 8 percent said he should not resign.
   An ABC News poll broadcast Thursday night found that while many
Americans are unaware of the Wright case or don't have enough
information to judge whether the charges are true, 21 percent
believe he should quit immediately and 59 percent say he should
resign if the charges are proven. The survey questioned 540 people
on Wednesday.
   A Wright supporter, Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, accused Phelan
of trying to let the speaker twist as long as possible and be
battered by the news media.
   ``A la John Tower, the prosecutor figures as long as he can
delay it's worse for the accused,'' Wilson said after a meeting
with Wright and aides to plan political strategy.
   Wright's chief accuser, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said pressure
is bilding on House leaders to urge the speaker to step down soon
from his high-visibility post.
   ``I would be very surprised if the senior members of the
Democratic leadership don't try to talk the speaker into stepping
down before going through the agony of a public defense, public
cross examination,'' Gingrich, the House Republican whip, said at a
luncheon with reporters.
   Since Monday's ethics committee announcement _ the equivalent of
an indictment on charges of violating House rules _ there has been
a series of negotiations between Phelan and Wright's lawyer,
William C. Oldaker, and a flurry of letters between the speaker's
office and that of the committee.
   Under the panel's rules, the filing of charges must be followed
by a formal admission or denial of each charge by Wright, then by a
period in which the committee reviews the evidence and decides what
charges, if any, to make the subject of a disciplinary hearing.
   In a letter Tuesday, Wright made a formal blanket denial of all
the charges. But while asking for an expedited hearing before the
ethics committee, he also did not address certain requirements of
the panel's rules.
   Committee members said it appeared Wright was seeking to jump
ahead to a disciplinary hearing in which only his side would be
heard.
   ``You can't say, `let's forget all the evidence, I'll just go
before the jury and make my case','' said Rep. Thomas Petri,
R-Wis., a member of the ethics panel. ``He can't waive our
presentation of the facts and evidence. Phelan has an obligation to
present evidence to the full committee and give Wright a chance to
question it and offer his own witnesses.''
   Meanwhile, two panel members were scheduled to go to Texas early
next week as part of the committee's continuing investigation into
an oil well deal called the Sabine Lake prospect. Mallightco, the
investment company owned by Wright and his business partner George
Mallick, bought a 4 percent interest in the well for an initial
payment of $9,120 on May 10, 1988.
   Despite what the ethics committee described as a pessimistic
outlook for the well, that interest was sold on the same day to
Union Rheinische Petroleum Inc. for $440,000, less Mallightco's
$90,000 share of drilling costs. Wright has denied any knowledge of
the investment, noting that his interest in Mallightco was at that
time in a blind trust.
   The Los Angeles Times and the New York Times reported Thursday
that there are close links between Union Rheinische and Jaffe
Energy Corp., the company which arranged the sale of Mallightco's
interest for a huge profit. A related company, Jaffe Aerospace
Corp., has been courting the Air Force in an effort to sell a new
basic trainer aircraft to replace the aging T-37, the newspapers
reported.

   Tens of thousands of people crowded into a square
today and cheered as student demonstrators waved banners demanding
greater political freedoms and carried wreaths honoring a dead
leader who favored reform.
   The crowd of up to 100,000 swept from one side of the 100-acre
Tiananmen Square the other every time a new group of
wreath-carriers arrived.
   At one point about 1,000 people crossed a low chain barrier and
trotted halfway up the steps of the adjacent Great Hall of the
People, the national seat of government. They did not try to enter
the hall.
   Today's gathering was the largest of five straight days of
demonstrations on the square following the April 15 death of former
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, which touched off long-simmering
anti-government sentiments.
   Meanwhile, another 20,000 students from Beijing University and
at least nine other schools gathered in northwest Beijing and began
a nine-mile walk to the square to join the demonstrations.
   The students chanted ``long live democracy'' and ``down with
corruption'' as they marched along a road, tying up traffic. People
in buses stranded by the march looked out the windows and cheered
the demonstrators.
   Hu, who died of a heart attack at age 73, was admired by
students for protecting the rights of scientists and intellectuals.
   Students from more than 20 universities have placed wreaths to
Hu's memory on a monument to revolutionary heroes on the square,
and hoisted banners calling for democracy and freedom of speech and
press.
   A well-known writer, Lao Gui, put up a banner written in his own
blood eulogizing Hu and urging students not to stop praising him.
   Numerous small groups made their way through the crowd to the
monument today, including one group from Nankai University in
Tianjin and representatives from the Science and Technology Daily.
   ``China's political life is even more pitiful than our economic
life,'' a government official from the Committee for Restructuring
the Economy told The Associated Press. The official said, ``Our
consciousness is higher than it was before but still the government
won't permit us to express our views.''
   Police vehicles drove along the outside of the square
broadcasting through loudspeakers: ``Keep moving, don't interfere
with people's work.'' Police did not try to break up the rallies.
   About 100 students from the China School of Journalism carried
banners reading ``press freedom'' and ``we need facts'' as they
marched on the square and then around the Great Hall of the People.
   China's official press again warned that further anti-government
acts by students would not be tolerated.
   ``Anyone who attempts to undermine unity under any excuse will
be punished by law,'' said the People's Daily, official paper of
the Communist Party.
   ``Until now the government has acted with restraint toward these
illegal activities. If anyone takes this attitude as one of
weakness ... they will eat their own bitter fruit.''
   The editorial referred to attempts by thousands of students
Tuesday and Wednesday to force their way into the Communist Party
headquarters.
   The students were pushed back by police at the gate of the
red-walled compound near the square and later dispersed by large
contingents of police.
   On Thursday, only about 1,500 students braved a daylong downpour
to march to the square.
   Universities and the official press have told students that they
may participate in officially sanctioned mourning activities, but
have warned students not to use the occasions for anti-government
activities.
   The Communist Party will hold a memorial service for Hu at the
Great Hall on Saturday morning.
   Students in Nanjing and Shanghai also have used Hu's death to
demonstrate for political reforms. There have been unconfirmed
reports of student rallies in Tianjin, Wuhan and Hefei.
   The rallies have been the largest since pro-democracy
demonstrations in the winter of 1986-87. Those demonstrations were
followed by a conservative backlash against Western liberal ideas
that included the ouster of Hu as party general secretary.
   Hu was blamed for failing to stop the students and the trend
toward ``bourgeois liberalization.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Leader Calls for Investments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa, leader of Solidarity and champion of
Poland's new political course, told Italian political leaders today
that his country needs investment, rather than aid.
   ``Poland has all the figures to be part of of Europe, but it
needs investments, more than aid _ investments to create companies
and a market,'' the Polish labor leader told Premier Ciriaco De
Mita.
   Walesa traveled to Italy just days after Poland's communist
government restored the legality of the Solidarity labor movement
and agreed to free elections for a new house of Parliament.
   The labor leader, who played a key role in negotiations leading
to the reforms, met with Pope John Paul II on Thursday to receive
his blessing for Poland's new reforms.
   Walesa drummed home his plea for investments in talks today with
President Francesco Cossiga, Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti,
Socialist Party leader Bettino Craxi and Rome Mayor Pietro Giubilo.
   In a 35-minute meeting with the premier, Walesa said Solidarity
intended to fight economic centralism and work for political,
economic and social pluralism. Foreign investment would play a key
role in helping Poles reach those goals, he said.
   ``There is everything to be done in our country and therefore
cooperation can also be good business,'' said the labor leader,
winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize.
   Walesa also emphasized that Poland wants to be integrated into
Europe and not shut out when European Community countries form an
internal market without borders in 1992.
   ``We Poles count on you heavily in constructing the new
Poland,'' he told Andreotti, according to a translation from the
Foreign Ministry. ``I think that we can together build a single
Europe, and you can be our teachers.''
   De Mita and Andreotti assured Walesa that Italy would encourage
investment in Poland and support economic and political change in
the country.
   ``The European Community, in its entirety, must look at the
East, starting from the primary locomotive of its economic force,
which ought to move toward the East consolidating the dialogue of
peace in the economic-commercial area,'' said Craxi, who was
Italy's prime minister from 1983-87.
   ``A Europe that closes up within itself and doesn't know how to
look to the south and to the east is a myopic and egoistic
Europe,'' he added.
   The situation in Poland is of keen interest in Italy, which has
a strong union tradition and is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.
   Poland's government imposed martial law in December 1981 to
crush Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union.
With the legalization of Solidarity, the communist government is
hoping to win the union movement's support in reviving the economy
and encourage new aid from the West.
   The Catholic Church, extremely influential in Poland, took part
in the negotiations with the government that produced the reforms.

   A program that earmarks 10 percent of
city and school board contracts for minorities and women has been
halted pending trial by a federal judge.
   The preliminary injunction issued Thursday by U.S. District
Judge John H. Moore II takes the place of a temporary restraining
order that shut down the programs April 6. The future of the
set-aside program, challenged as unconstitutional by non-minority
contractors, will be decided at a trial in December.
   About $14 million is earmarked each year by the city and school
board for companies owned and operated by minorities and women.
   ``The court finds that the public interest is served by ensuring
that the legislative bodies' programs conform to the provisions of
the United States Constitution,'' Moore said in his ruling.
   Moore cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in January that declared
minority set-aside programs unconstitutional unless they are based
on a detailed study showing the minorities have faced governmental
discriminination in the past.
   Neither the city nor the school board has conducted a study on
the 10 percent set-aside programs started in 1984. A study is
scheduled to be conducted soon, officials said.
   Officials with the Northeast Florida chapter of Associated
General Contractors and Barcorp., which filed the suit challenging
the set-asides, said their rights were being violated because they
could not bid on some of the city and school board projects.
   Blacks in this city of 550,000 claim the ruling means they will
be shut out of contracts.
   ``It's going to put us back in the same predicament as five
years ago,'' said Ernest McDuffie III, a contractor who has
received work under the program. ``A lot of people will go out of
business and people won't have work.''

<HEAD>Authors Withdraw Paper on Fusion From Scientific Journal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The authors of a highly publicized report on
room-temperature nuclear fusion have decided not to publish it in a
prestigious British scientific journal, the editors announced
Thursday.
   B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and Martin Fleischmann
of Britain's University of Southampton had said publicly that they
submitted the paper to Nature magazine, an editorial in Thursday's
issue noted.
   Following standard practice, editors referred the paper to other
scientists for review. These referees raised several questions that
would require Pons and Fleischmann to do more work on the paper,
Nature said.
   But ``Fleischmann and Pons have taken the view that they could
not at the same time satisfy the referees and get on with other
urgent work,'' Nature said.
   So their paper will not be published, but a second cold fusion
paper, from a team including Brigham Young University scientist
Steven Jones, will appear in next Thursday's issue, Nature said.
Jones and colleagues did make changes requested by referees, Nature
said.
   Pam Fogle, a University of Utah spokeswoman, said Nature
``specifically asked for more data and to flesh out the article by
some 1,000 to 2,000 words. Some of the data they were asking for
was coming out of experiments that are currently operating. They
didn't have the data to supply to the reviewers for the second
go-round.''
   Fleischmann and Pons already have reported their work in the
Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, Nature noted.
   Nature said that the absence of their article should not be
taken to imply that their research is inherently less believable
than the work by Jones and colleagues.
   Nor does the appearance of Jones' paper mean that ``all those
who have seen it are persuaded to its chief conclusion,'' the
editorial said. It just means that ``the authors have produced an
article which answers questions that would otherwise spring to
readers' minds,'' it said.
   Both teams of researchers say they have produced nuclear fusion
at room temperature, in contrast to the extreme heat used in
standard fusion experients.
   Fusion powers the sun and stars, and scientists say it may
provide an environmentally benign source of energy if it can be
harnessed.

   Iran said today it has cracked several
U.S. espionage rings and vowed to punish the ``big American spies''
who were plotting to overthrow the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani announced during a weekly
prayer session at Tehran University that a large number of the
spies have been arrested in recent weeks, according to Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported, monitored in
Nicosia.
   He claimed the arrests have exposed the entire CIA operation in
the Middle East. Rafsanjani said the Americans ``should have
realized that ... this country is no place for coups.''
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
he had no information on the spy allegations.
   ``My information is we don't really know what they're talking
about. They make similar claims every once in a while about
American spies when they need a little attention,'' Fitzwater said.
   Rafsanjani said some of the spies were Iranian navy personnel
who transmitted intelligence on Iranian naval deployments to the
U.S. Navy ``when they were fighting us in the Persian Gulf.''
   He said the Iranian ship Iran Ajr, which was attacked and
boarded by U.S. forces in the gulf on Sept. 21, 1987 as it was
laying mines, was ``betrayed by these very people.''
   Rafsanjani said the arrests included ``big American spies'' who
were now being interrogated. He did not say how many people were
rounded up because ``the Americans should not know how many have
been trapped. There are too many.'' But he stressed that the navy
officers who had allegedly spied for the Americans ``are
fortunately still alive.''
   He claimed the Americans ``have announced these people have been
executed, because they are not aware of their whereabouts.''
   Rafsanjani did not name the navy men. But dissident Iranian
sources reported recently that three senior navy officers were
executed in early April for plotting to overthrow the government.
   They were identified as Adm. Kianoosh Hakimi, commander of naval
communications and joint operations with the air force; Adm.
Ghahreman Malezzadeh, naval representative at the chief of staff's
office; and Adm. Farhad Riahi, commander of the airborne units.
   The sources said that about 20 other pro-Western navy officers
had been arrested on charges of spying.
   The Iranian news agency said the thousands of Shiite Moslem
worshipers around the campus in downtown Tehran chanted: ``American
spies must be executed.'' Rafsanjani vowed that ``God's decree will
be carried out'' and that the alleged spies would be punished.
   He did not elaborate. But Iranian authorities have executed
hundreds of political dissidents and alleged drug smugglers in
recent months.
   Iran's news agency said Rafsanjani disclosed that ``numerous
espionage dens and networks'' set up since the 1979 Islamic
revolution had been discovered ``in various places and sensitive
parts of the country.''
   He added: ``We have sustained losses from them during the war
(with Iraq) and in recent days.''
   Rafsanjani's disclosure came amid a resurgence of radical
fundamentalism in which hardliners led by Interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi have gained control of the Tehran hierarchy at the
expense of so-called pragmatists like Rafsanjani.
   The disclosure appeared to be designed to stir anti-Western
sentiment at a time when Iran is gripped by political uncertainty
and serious economic difficulties in the post-war period.
   The alleged discovery of U.S. spy cells comes amid a reportedly
widespread purge in the armed forces and other power centers in
Iran as the hardliners gained strength after Khomeini's drive to
rekindle revolutionary fervor.

   The Brown family is celebrating the
birth of its first female child in 102 years.
   Family members gathered this week for a family portrait and to
celebrate the birth of Rebekah Anne Charlotte Brown at 1:47 a.m.
April 8 at Soldiers Memorial Hospital.
   ``I actually thought it was going to be a boy,'' Rebekah's
mother, Barbara, 23, told the Orillia Packet and Times. ``I didn't
think it would be possible to break the tradition.''
   Mrs. Brown, a pharmacist's assistant, and her 22-year-old
husband, Paul, a builder, live in Horseshoe Valley, 10 miles west
of this town in the Lake Simcoe resort area north of Toronto.
   ``I was just ecstatic in the delivery room,'' Brown said. ``I
couldn't believe we'd break a tradition like that. We were hoping
for a girl for the family's sake.''
   The string of males began after great-great grandfather Garfield
Brown's sister, Rhoda, was born in 1887.
   Garfield and his wife, Eva, had one son, Clarence, who had
Garnet, Elmer and Larry.
   Larry had three sons. Elmer and Garnet each had two sons.
Garnet's sons are Paul and Barry.
   Of the current generation, Barry was the first to become a
father. His son, Tyler, was born two years ago.
   Paul said Rebekah is a healthy eight pounds, six ounces.

<TEXT>
   Maverick attorney Mark Lane today confirmed he
is interested in representing presidential assailant John W.
Hinckley Jr., but denied suggestions he wants to write a book about
the man who shot President Reagan.
   Lane, who made a national reputation for his writings on
assassination conspiracy theories, insisted that Hinckley's
interest in retaining him was based solely on a desire for
effective legal counsel rather than to collaborate on a book.
   He said ``it appears that Mr. Hinckley seems more settled, more
concerned about constitutional rights and more accurate and less
emotionally disturbed than are his keepers'' at a local mental
institution where Hinckley has been held since his 1982 acquittal
by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting of Reagan and three
others.
   Lane, who said he has spoken with Hinckley several times by
telephone since Hinckley called him in early March, also dismissed
suggestions that he would seek payment of his legal fees in
revenues from a book on the case.
   ``I have never made any agreement with any client in which my
fee was paid by the publication of a book,'' Lane said in a
telephone interview from Daytona Beach, Fla., where he is
representing a man on death row. ``I never have because I believe
that generally constitutes a conflict of interest.''
   Lane commented in response to testimony Thursday in federal
court in which Hinckley said he wanted to hire Lane because ``he
has done very well'' defending famous criminals.
   ``He has taken some cases of national .... reknown,'' Hinckley
said in his first testimony, choosing the last word after a long,
careful pause.
   ``He has represented some people who are famous to the general
public,'' Hinckley told prosecutor Robert R. Chapman. These clients
gained notoriety ``as criminals, in the criminal world.''
   Hinckley won permission at Thursday's hearing to meet with Lane
or other lawyers at the mental hospital.
   Hinckley, who initially did not identify the lawyer-author by
name, told U.S. District Judge June L. Green that he telephoned
Lane because ``he had somewhat of a reputation.''
   ``What kind of reputation?'' the judge said.
   ``He is just known nationwide in certain circles. I had heard of
him in the past representing a number of people.''
   ``He has certainly had many cases and done well with them,''
explained Hinckley, who wore a navy blazer over an open-neck plaid
sports shirt.
   Hospital lawyer Janet L. Maher contended that Hinckley would
expose himself to exploitation if allowed to interview prospective
attorneys without court supervision.
   ``Are you aware that in fact he has written a number of books
about political assassinations?'' she asked Hinckley.
   ``I know of one book he has written,'' Hinckley replied.
   ``What book is that?'' the judge interjected.
   ``Do you want me to just give this person's name because we are
going to lead into that?'' Hinckley said.
   After the judge indicated she did, Hinckley said: ``He has
written a book called `Rush to Judgment.' His name is Mark Lane.''
   Hospital authorities canceled his appointment with Lane,
Hinckley said.
   ``I should at least be permitted to talk to the man,'' Hinckley
said. ``If we don't get along, it stops right there.''
   In his 1966 book ``Rush to Judgment,'' Lane disputed the
findings of the Warren Commission that Lee Harvey Oswald alone shot
and killed President Kennedy in 1963 in Dallas.
   Hinckley also acknowledged that he knew that at one time Lane
had represented James Earl Ray, who killed the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.
   Asked if he knew that Lane had also written other books about
people he represented, Hinckley said: ``I don't think it's a crime
that he's written these books and interviewed these people. I am
sure that the subjects he has written about at some point gave
their consent.''
   ``I am capable of deciding whether I want my story told and it
is not the hospital's say to dictate whether I can do that,'' said
Hinckley, who spoke lucidly and appeared relaxed on the witness
stand.
   Vincent J. Fuller, the lawyer who successfully defended Hinckley
at the 1982 trial, did not oppose the motion for a new lawyer.
Fuller said he was relieved to be dismissed from the case.
   ``He wanted new counsel; he's entitled to it. I did not want to
stand in his way,'' Fuller said as he left the courthouse.
   A psychiatrist at St. Elizabeths Hospital here testified that
Hinckley was competent to pick a new lawyer but had been placed in
a maximum-security ward because he had ``difficulty handling the
privileges'' he had previously been given.
   Dr. Raymond Patterson said Hinckley still suffers from a serious
mental illness, ``continues to have difficulty in his judgment''
and has ``difficulty learning from his past experience.''
   He can't ``differentiate famous from infamous,'' Patterson said.
``He does not have a clear perception of how he is seen by others.''
   In 1987, Hinckley was living in a dormitory-style room when
federal prosecutors turned up evidence he was corresponding with
serial killer Ted Bundy, who was executed last year.
   That revelation and others prompted the hospital to drop its
attempt to give Hinckley an Easter weekend pass that year to visit
his family.
   Plans to take him on an outing with other patients last summer
were abandoned after authorities discovered a new cache of letters,
which remain under court seal.
   The flair for writing that Hinckley has shown in several
articles he has written has prompted widespread speculation that he
wants to write a book about his life.
   Sources who have spoke on condition of anonymity say that among
the papers seized from his possession was a well-written manuscript.

<HEAD>Nationwide Search Launched For Convicted Nazi War Criminal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WUPPERTAL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have launched a nationwide
manhunt for a Nazi war criminal convicted of murdering Auschwitz
prisoners during sadistic target practice exercises, officials said
today.
   In a statement to the news media, the Wuppertal prosecutor's
office said former Nazi SS Sgt. Gottfried Weise, 69, ``is believed
to have fled his home to avoid arrest.'' Wuppertal is 15 miles east
of Duesseldorf.
   Weise was convicted Jan. 28, 1988, of killing at least five
prisoners in 1944 at the Nazis' notorious Auschwitz concentration
camp in what is now Poland. He worked at the camp as a guard during
World War II.
   During his 15-month trial, Weise became know as the ``William
Tell of Auschwitz'' after witnesses testified he killed an
8-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl by forcing them to balance
tin cans on their heads, which he then used for target practice.
   In addition to their deaths, Weise was found guilty of shooting
to death two male prisoners who tried to escape by hiding in a
supply truck, and another man who did not report quickly enough for
roll call.
   Weise was sentenced to life imprisonment but was allowed to
remain free pending an appeal.
   Horst Rosenbaum, the Wuppertal chief prosecutor, told reporters
police went to Weise's home in nearby Solingen on Thursday after
word was received that a federal court had turned down the
conviction appeal.
   He said Weise was not home and apparently had fled to avoid
arrest.
   ``We assume that he is on the run, and a nationwide search for
Weise has been started. All border crossing points have been
notified,'' Rosenbaum said.
   He added that the search would expand outside West Germany if
evidence is received indicating Weise may be in a foreign country.
   According to the prosecutor, Weise was not jailed pending the
outcome of the appeal ``because the court decided with his
retirement pension and home here, there was little danger of him
fleeing.''

   Suspected communist rebels firing
from a speeding car killed a U.S. Army officer and former Vietnam
prisoner of war today as he headed to work, officials said.
   Col. James N. Rowe, 51, of McAllen, Texas, was shot in the head
when at least two hooded assailants pulled up in an auto alongside
Rowe's car and shot him near his office at a military compound in
suburban Quezon City, the officials said.
   Col. Victor Tiangco of the Philippine military's Capital Region
Command said Rowe's driver, Joaquin Vinuya, was wounded in the 7
a.m. ambush but was not seriously injured.
   Tiangco said Rowe, a West Point graduate, was chief of the army
division at the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group, which provides
training and logistical support for the Philippine armed forces.
   President Corazon Aquino said the Philippine military would
increase security around the six U.S. military installations in the
wake of the attack.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the
killing ``a cowardly and heinous act.''
   ``We will work closely with the Philippine government in their
efforts to track down and bring to justice those responsible for
this assassination. The U.S. government's support for Philippine
democracy is unshaken,'' Fitzwater said.
   Rowe was held prisoner in a cage in the jungles of Vietnam by
the Viet Cong from October 1963 until he escaped on New Year's Eve
1968. He wrote a book about the ordeal titled ``Five Years to
Freedom.''
   ``After five years, I was out of the forest of darkness,'' Rowe
recalled after he gained his freedom. ``I could see the horizon and
the world seemed immense.''
   Police said a driver and at least two gunmen were in the
assailants' car. One had an M-16 rifle and another a .45-caliber
pistol, they said.
   Toto Austria, a cashier at a gasoline station, said he heard
shots and turned to see a white car pull alongside Rowe's
silver-gray vehicle.
   As the cars turned along a traffic circle, Austria said he saw
at least one man fire from a window. He said there was more gunfire
before the assailants made a U-turn and sped away.
   Police later found the assailants' car about 1{ miles west of
the ambush site, which was three blocks from the military compound.
Tiangco said 21 bullets struck Rowe's car.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, Jerry Huchel, said Rowe was dead on
arrival at a Philippine military hospital and that his body was
flown to Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila.
   No group claimed responsibility for the slaying. But Defense
Secretary Fidel Ramos and other officials said they believed
communist rebels were responsible because of the weapons used and
the style of the attack.
   ``On the face of it, it is likely that this was perpetrated by
communist terrorists,'' Ramos said.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said: ``If anyone thinks that
killing this brave officer would alter in any way U.S. policy of
support for Philippine democracy, they are wrong.''
   In Alexandria, Va., F. Andy Messing Jr., executive director of
the National Defense Council Foundation, said Rowe had expressed
concern about rebel terrorism during a meeting last month in Manila.
   ``He had an idea that it was going to occur,'' Messing said.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee,
said the killing highlighted the seriousness of the Marxist
insurgency.
   ``They (rebels) are operating not only in the mountains and
(villages) but openly here in metro Manila. So I keep saying that
it is wrong for us to keep maintaining that everything is fine, we
are winning'' the war, Maceda said.
   In October 1987, communist rebels killed three Americans and a
Filipino of American descent in simultaneous attacks near Clark Air
Base.
   On April 9, rebels blasted a U.S. military communications
station in Benguet province of northern Luzon island. No one was
injured, but U.S. officials asked that security around American
installations be tightened.
   The rebels have threatened more attacks against Americans
because of ``American interference'' in the 20-year insurgency.
   Rowe is survived by a wife and two young children.

   The Navy today began
transporting the remains of some of the 47 sailors killed in an
explosion aboard the USS Iowa to their hometowns for burial.
   Navy officials said they were still trying to identify some of
the bodies, but had enough information to issue a list naming all
47 victims.
   A brief ceremony was held Thursday after the arrival of the
remains. The Navy secretary knelt in prayer on one knee before a
flag-draped casket as taps was played.
   Secretary William L. Ball III said he was representing President
Bush, who served in the Navy during World War II.
   Ball said Bush ``knows the special agony which is like no other
that attends the loss of a shipmate _ he knows the dangers of
serving at sea, he knows the incomparable sacrifices made by those
who choose to wear the uniform of our naval service.''
   Ball said he had sailed on the Iowa and had met a number of the
crewmen who were killed.
   ``I had sailed with them and had crawled around their turret,
shaken their greasy hands, felt the strong sure grip that only a
gunner's mate can give,'' he said. ``It is our prayer today that
they will go from here to their resting places certain in the
knowledge that a grateful nation will not forget.''
   Families of the victims did not attend. But there were nine
crewmen from the battleship who accompanied the remains, and more
than 100 Air Force personnel were on hand to pay tribute to their
fallen comrades.
   The process of identifying the remains was aided by some 50
volunteers who were counseled in advance to prepare them for the
shock of the carnage, officials said.
   A memorial service is scheduled for Monday in Norfolk, Va., the
ship's home port, Navy spokesman Mark Neuhart said. A smaller
service was planned for today.
   The remains arrived from Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, aboard a
C-5A Galaxy cargo jet. As the plane was unloaded, a Navy honor
guard and other officials stood at attention while the Navy Band
from Washington alternately played the Navy hymn and ``America The
Beautiful.''
   The bodies were sent to Dover because it houses the nation's
largest military mortuary, operated by the Defense Department to
handle the remains of military personnel and dependents who die in
Europe, the Azores and Greenland.
   It also handled remains of sailors killed aboard the USS Stark
in May 1987, Marines killed in a terrorist bombing in Beirut in
October 1983 and the remains of military personnel and dependents
killed in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland.

   Many Americans are unfamiliar with the ethics
charges against House Speaker Jim Wright, but majorities say he
should resign as speaker if he violated the rules of Congress, two
national polls have found.
   A fifth of the respondents in an ABC News poll said Wright
should quit as speaker immediately, and an additional 59 percent
said he should resign his leadership position if the charges
against him were found to be true.
   In an NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey, 75 percent said
Wright should quit as speaker if the House found that he broke its
rules. That poll did not ask if Wright should resign immediately.
   The ABC poll found Wright's popularity declining. In an April 3
poll, 53 percent approved of his performance as speaker. In the
poll done Wednesday, two days after the ethics committee charged
Wright, 29 percent approved.
   About half those who no longer approved of Wright said they
disapproved of him. The other half were undecided.
   In the NBC-Journal poll, about one quarter of the respondents
had a favorable opinion of Wright and about a quarter had an
unfavorable opinion. The rest, nearly half, had no opinion of him.
   Both polls found another indication that the issue has not
gripped public attention: Nearly half in the NBC-Journal poll and
40 percent in the ABC poll said they had not heard or read anything
about the Wright affair.
   NBC and the Journal polled 1,447 adults Sunday through Tuesday,
and their poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points. ABC polled 540 adults Wednesday night; its survey had a
5-point margin of error.
   Poll results can vary because of the wording of questions and
because of changing events that prompt movements in public opinion.
The ethics committee charged Wright on Monday, while the
NBC-Journal poll was being conducted.
   Wright was cited Monday for 69 violations of House rules,
including allegations he improperly accepted nearly $145,000 in
gifts and that his wife was paid $72,000 for work she didn't do.
   He has denied charges he violated any House rules, including the
alleged use of book sales to avoid a limit on fees for speeches.

   The Viet Cong kept James N. Rowe in a cage in the jungle of
Vietnam for five years, but they couldn't break his spirit with a
constant barrage of propaganda and almost daily death threats.
   Instead, it was hooded gunmen in the Philippines who took the
life of the 51-year-old Army colonel. He was shot to death Friday
as he drove to work at the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group
headquarters. No group immediately claimed responsiblity, but
investigators believed the killers were Communist rebels.
   Rowe, who was decorated for his Vietnamese ordeal, escaped from
his cage on New Year's Eve, 1968. He was nearly killed by U.S.
forces who thought the black-pajama-clad Special Forces officer was
a Viet Cong.
   He came home to Texas' Rio Grande Valley to a hero's welcome.
   Rowe, a native of McAllen, graduated from West Point in 1960,
and was captured by the Viet Cong Oct. 29, 1963.
   After he managed to escape, Rowe sighted a U.S. Cobra helicopter
and ran into a clearing, signaling for help.
   The first impulse of the men in the helicopter was to shoot the
man because he was dressed like the Viet Cong, but Army Maj. Dave
Thompson ordered the men not to shoot because he wanted to take him
prisoner.
   In his book, ``Five Years To Freedom,'' Rowe recalled that he
jumped into the helicopter and began trying to tell them who he was.
   ``After five years I was out of the forest of darkness,'' Rowe
recalled. ``I could see the horizon and the world seemed immense.''
   Rowe was taken to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio for
a medical examination and treatment and then was allowed to fly
home.
   As the helicopter approached McAllen, Rowe wrote, ``I was
totally absorbed with my thoughts as I watched the towns pass
below, bringing me miles closer to my home; it had been such a
long, long journey both in time and space.''
   At his parents' home, it was an emotional scene as the young
officer dashed from the car to the front porch, where his father,
Lee Rowe, opened the door.
   ``Dad, dad, I'm sorry I didn't get home sooner; they just
wouldn't let me go,'' he said.
   Rowe earlier had told reporters he had asked his mother,
Florence, to bake some bread for his first meal at home.
   Rowe hugged his parents, describing it as ``five long years'
worth of hugging.''
   ``The three of us stood for a long moment, touching,
communicating without speaking,'' Rowe recalled. ``My world was
complete; I had reached out and touched the light.''
   A few weeks later, Rowe made a speech at McAllen High School's
football stadium and a parade was held. Thousands turned out for a
glimpse of the hometown hero.
   Lee Rowe died in 1973 and Mrs. Rowe died in 1982.
   John Ford, one of Rowe's cousins, remembered Rowe as a brave man
who knew what he was getting into when he was sent to Vietnam.
   ``He knew it was a hot spot when he went over there. He knew he
had to be careful,'' Ford said Friday from his McAllen home.
   ``He walked like an Army officer, he talked like one and he died
like one.''

<HEAD>Library Fire Third Arson Attack Against Children's Books in Illinois
Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOLIET, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of children's books have gone up
in flames in this northern Illinois community, and authorities are
trying to determine who is behind firebomb attacks on the public
library and two schools.
   The third and latest incident was the firebombing of the Joliet
Public Library on Wednesday night. Children's Librarian Dianne
Harmon said today that damage estimates to the books and historic
building ranged from $800,000 to $1.5 million.
   ``I've been here 31 years, and I've never seen anyone burning
for books,'' Fire Chief George Plese said Thursday. ``I've seen
them burn for money, burn for spite, burn for all kinds of reasons.
But never for books.''
   No one has been injured in the three firebomb attacks, which
have been started with the same kind of incendiary device at about
the same time of day, said officials in this community of 75,000
about 35 miles southwest of Chicago.
   On Feb. 10, a bottle filled with a fire accelerant was thrown
into a book-storage room at Hufford Junior High School, causing
damage estimated at $15,000.
   On Monday, a Molotov cocktail was thrown through a window into a
book storage room at Marycrest Elementary School, causing at least
$10,000 in damage and closing the school for a day.
   And sometime after 9 p.m. Wednesday an incendiary device of some
type, believed to be a Molotov cocktail, was hurled through a
window at the public library, Plese said.
   Despite the similarities, police said they are not making any
assumptions about whether the firebombings are connected.
   Librarian James Johnston choked back tears as he surveyed the
damage from the fire.
   ``I went through my professional calm and I am going through my
combat rage,'' said Johnston, a Korean War veteran.
   The children's books section took the brunt of the damage, but
smoke damage was in evidence throughout the 86-year-old limestone
structure.
   The children's section of the library comprised about 48,000
books, and Harmon estimated that one-quarter to one-half of the
collection could be salvaged. Johnston said roughly 60 percent of
the books were out of print.
   He said the city's insurance should cover most of the loss.
   Joliet officials, the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the state fire marshal's office
were investigating.

   A jury began deliberating the fate of Oliver
North today, after one of the alternate jurors who sat through his
criminal trial said of North's role in the Iran-Contra affair: ``He
knew it was wrong.''
   ``No one said `if you don't do this we're going to fire you,'''
alternate juror Horasina McKie told CBS News, addressing one of the
central points North used in his defense _ that all his actions
were authorized by superiors.
   Ms. McKie, among the five alternates excused from the panel
Thursday, said she thinks President Reagan knew about North's
activities.
   ``I believe Mr. Reagan knew what was going on,'' she told CBS.
``I can't say he knew everything, but I think he knew enough to
know what was going on. I mean, you see (national security adviser
Robert) McFarlane every week, he's only 100 yards from you or feet
from you.''
   Reagan told the Tower commission on Jan. 26, 1987 that he did
not know that the National Security Council staff was engaged in
helping the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   During two hours of deliberations this morning, the jury sent
out requests to the judge for more copies of the jury instructions,
pencils, writing paper and paper clips. They also asked when lunch
would be, saying through an emissary that ``we want to get on a
schedule.'' Lunch will be at noon each day.
   Ms. McKie's comments addressed a central point North has used in
his defense.
   The former White House aide testified that he had authorization
for all his actions in the Iran-Contra affair, including allegedly
obstructing Congress by denying that he was assisting the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   ``Mr. North ... wasn't made to do what he did,'' said Ms. McKie.
``He had a choice in it. He had a choice to either say `No, I don't
want to do this' or `yes sir, I will do this' even as it went along
and he knew it was wrong.''
   That remark addresses criminal intent, a question that will be
central to the jury's deliberations.
   Ms. McKie said she would have voted to convict North on some
charges, acquit him on others, but she emphasized she had not
discussed the case with other jurors and thus could not say how
they felt.
   If convicted on all 12 counts against him, North could face
maximum prison terms totaling 60 years and fines of $3 million.
   North testified that he had no idea any of his actions violated
the law and that he had good motives for what he did.
   He said he destroyed a ledger showing how he had spent $300,000
in cash on orders of CIA director William Casey because the
document contained names of Contras leaders and that exposure could
have endangered their lives. North is accused of illegally
converting $4,300 from the $300,000 cash fund to his own use.
   The jury foreman, Denise Anderson, 34, presides over a group of
nine women and three men chosen for their task 2{ months ago
because they were among the few Americans who hadn't watched, read
or heard anything substantial about North's televised testimony in
1987.
   Ms. Anderson, a hospital employee, was picked for the jury after
telling lawyers: ``I don't like the news.''
   In two hours of instructions Thursday, the 12 jurors were told
to consider only in a narrowly defined context North's assertion
that all his actions were directed by higher-ups including
President Reagan .
   ``Authorization requires clear, direct instructions to act at a
given time in a given way,'' said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell.
   ``It must be specific, not simply a general admonition or vague
expression of preference.''
   Gesell said ``neither the president'' nor North's bosses ``had
the legal authority to order anyone to violate the law.''
   At the same time, the judge encouraged the jury to consider the
atmosphere of secrecy that pervaded the Reagan administration in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   Emphasizing that ``our country is governed by the rule of law,''
Gesell said others ``ranking above or below'' North may have
engaged in the same kind of conduct he did.
   ``Some have pled guilty to charges, some await trial, some are
dead, others have received immunity in exchange for testifying,''
said the judge. ``This evidence was admitted so you would better
understand the atmosphere in which, and the circumstances under
which the defendant was working as these may bear'' on North's
intent.
   North's defense that his bosses gave him the go-ahead for
everything he did could apply to as many as eight of the 12
criminal charges against him. However, the judge's instructions
likely will curtail its importance in the jurors' deliberations.
   Gesell emphasized a number of points that could be favorable to
North.
   The judge pointed out conflicting evidence over whether a
proposed congressional resolution of inquiry was pending or not
when North lied to the House Intelligence Committee in 1986. In the
Aug. 6, 1986 session, North denied he was assisting the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels. One congressional committee had already voted down
the resolution.

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rioting over price rises spread to northern
Jordan today, but the government blocked Moslem prayer meetings in
the south to prevent more disurbances there.
   Cancellation of Friday prayers is highly unusual in an Islamic
country such as Jordan. The Islamic holy book, the Koran, calls on
Moslems to participate in the ceremony and most take it as a
binding duty.
   Residents and security forces said about 500 people hurled
stones at police and demolished five police cars this afternoon in
the city of Salt, 10 miles northwest of Amman.
   Police said the city had been blocked off, joining the southern
towns of Maan, Kerak, Mutah, Mazar and others.
   Residents of Maan, 120 miles south of Amman, and nearby cities
said in telephone interviews that soldiers prevented prayer
gatherings and ordered people to stay home.
   Relatives of Communist Party members said the government
arrested as many as 100 party members overnight, apparently in
connection with the disturbances, which have killed eight people
since Tuesday.
   The protests marked the worst violence in Jordan since the army
crushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1970-71.
   The communists' relatives told The Associated Press that
intelligence officers raided the homes of party members in Amman
and the northern cities of Irbid, Madaba, Zarqa and Fuheis.
   Hours earlier, the party had distributed a leaflet calling on
the government to rescind prices rises that triggered the rioting.
   The leaflet also demanded the government scrap an austerity
program aimed at dealing with Jordan's economic problems, which
include a $6 billion foreign debt and 20 percent unemployment.
   Government officials, as is common, did not report the arrests.
   Rioting apparently spread to northern Jordan for the first time
Thursday night.
   A security official speaking on condition of anonymity said
protesters in Irbid burned trucks and tires and clashed with police
Thursday night. Irbid is 40 miles north of the capital.
   Mayor Mahmoud Al-Awneh of Tayyba, anothern northern town, said
1,000 people protested there Thursday night, breaking windows in
the school and town hall.
   In Madaba, 20 miles south of Amman, windows were smashed in a
bank and municipal building. Residents said 100 people demonstrated
Thursday night.
   Police manned trucks mounted with machine guns at key
intersections in several towns today, the Moslem day of prayer when
worshipers usually visit mosques. Troops also were deployed in
Amman, which has been free of violence.
   An official statement read over state-run Jordan Radio gave
Jordanians the first official details of the rioting to be reported
internally.
   It said police were ``trying to determine the persons and the
sides behind all these pitiful incidents and to learn about their
motives.''
   Officials earlier had hinted that Moslem fundamentalists might
have encouraged the disturbances.
   Crown Prince Hassan, younger brother of King Hussein, said in an
interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday that
eight people had been killed and about 30 wounded in the rioting,
which broke out Tuesday in Maan and spread to other southern cities.
   The region is noted for its support of Hussein, but incomes
there are generally low.
   The statement today said one policeman and four civilians died
in Maan. It blamed the deaths on ``shooting by the rioters.'' Maan
residents said the four civilians were killed by security forces.
They said rioters also fired guns.
   The statement said the riots started when taxi drivers ``incited
schoolchildren and citizens of Maan to demonstrate over the price
increase'' imposed Sunday as part of an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund to reschedule Jordan's debt.
   Many rioters have blamed Prime Minister Zaid Rifai for the
austerity measures and demanded his ouster.
   The measures include a 25 percent increase in the price of
gasoline, to $1.65 per gallon, and increases of 10 percent to 50
percent in the price of cigarettes, cooking gas, heating oil and
other products. Living standards have fallen sharply over the past
year and unemployment is nearly 20 percent.

<HEAD>Chess Grandmasters Play Exhibition Soccer Match</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World chess champion Garri Kasparov and
other leading grandmasters put away their boards for a few hours
Friday and played an exhibition soccer match with some former
professional players.
   ``You get fresh air and enjoyment and it shows that we are
normal people who are interested in many things, not just chess,''
Kasparov said afterward.
   Seven grandmasters from the Chess World Cup tournament, which
ended Thursday, scored a 3-3 tie with a team representing chess
journalists and organizers.
   Both teams were bolstered by former professionals from Spanish
soccer powerhouse Barcelona. The grandmasters also fielded Manuel
Orantes, the former Spanish tennis champion who is the non-playing
captain of Spain's Davis Cup team.
   ``I had a very nice time,'' said Ljubomir Ljubojevic, a Yugoslav
grandmaster who tied for first place with Kasparov in the
tournament and who played for the youth soccer team of Red Star
Belgrade when he was 14. ``Unfortunately we only assisted in the
game. The ex-professionals played more among themselves.''
   When the tall, gangly figure of British Grandmaster Jonathan
Speelman ran too far down the field from his defensive position,
Soviet grandmasters Artur Yusupov and Valery Salov shouted in
English: ``Johnny, come back!''
   Several grandmasters, already exhausted by three weeks of
top-flight chess competition, only played in one of the two halves.
Kasparov, 26, was the only chess player to stay on the field for
the whole game.
   Soccer matches have been played at some international chess
events for years, but grandmasters have become far more careful
since Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman broke his leg at a match during
a tournament in 1984 in London.
   Despite impressive footwork from Salov and agressive running
from Kasparov, five of the six goals were scored by the
ex-professionals. The exception came when a Dutch journalist drove
the ball into the grandmasters' goal in the second half.
   ``Football (soccer) is a great game,'' said Miguel Illescas, a
Spanish grandmaster. ``We can forget all our rivalries and show
good team spirit.''

   The death toll from a hailstorm that ripped
through southwest China's Sichuan province has reached 87, the
official Xinhua News Agency said Friday.
   About 4,200 people in 10 cities were injured in Thursday's
storm, which caused an estimated $40 million in damage in the
hardest-hit city of Luzhou.
   The report quoted Sichuan officials as saying 90,000 homes were
damaged in Luzhou, and 40 percent of the windows and doors in high
buildings were damaged. Fifty-two air force training aircraft
stationed in Luzhou were damaged.
   More than 60,000 houses in Gulin County and 4,300 in Zigong City
were destroyed, the officials said.
   The storm struck shortly after midnight and continued until 4
a.m. Thursday, pelting the area with hailstorms measuring 1 inch in
diameter and winds up to 63 mph.

   President Bush invited a divergent group of
economists and business leaders for ``a freewheeling and open
discussion of the economy'' this weekend at Camp David, a White
House spokesman said Friday.
   Marlin Fitzwater said the guests would include former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, now a New York investment consultant
and professor at Princeton University, IBM chief John Akers and
Paul O'Neill, the chairman of Alcoa.
   ``It's another one of these kinds of discussions the president
likes to have with authorities and experts outside of the
government to discuss all kinds of issues without worrying about
policy decisions,'' Fitzwater said.
   Also invited were: Kathryn Eickhoff, president of Eickhoff
Economics and former chief economist at the Office of Management
and Budget; Richard Rahn, vice president and chief economist of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Jude Wanniski, who heads a consulting
in Morristown, N.J.
   Three former chairmen of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers were also on the guest list: Beryl Sprinkel, now a private
consultant; Martin Felstein, now a Harvard professor, and Herb
Stein, now with the American Enterprise Institute.
   Fitzwater said that the group would meet privately with Bush at
the presidential retreat in western Maryland in the morning and
stay for lunch.
   ``It will be a freewheeling and open discussion of the
economy,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said administration officials attending would include
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Director Richard Darman
and the current chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers,
Michael Boskin.
   Fitzwater said that the meeting was not prompted by any upcoming
policy decisions, but just by a desire on Bush's part to have a
discussion on the economy.
   Some of those invited served as economic advisers to Bush during
last year's presidential campaign.

   Lockheed Missile Systems Division of
Sunnyvale, Calif., has been selected as prime contractor for the
design, development and testing of a new solid-fueled rocket motor
for the space shuttle, NASA announced today.
   The space agency said negotiations will begin with Lockheed on
the details of a contract award for the new rocket. The contract is
expected to include an option for the production of up to 44 motor
sets. Total contract value is estimated at about $1.1 billion over
seven years.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to
develop a new, more powerful solid rocket to use with the shuttle
in the mid-1990s. The new rocket is expected to be safer and more
reliable than the solid rocket now used with the shuttle. The new
rocket also has a design goal of being able to put an additional
12,000 pounds of payload into orbit.
   NASA announced earlier that facilities for production of the new
rocket motor will be built at Yellow Creek, a site in extreme
northeastern Mississippi near the town of Iuka. The site currently
is owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority, but will be transferred
to NASA.
   New testing facilities for the new rocket are planned for the
John C. Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Miss., the space
agency said.
   NASA said the rocket contract with Lockheed will require the
company to produce the first 12 operational motors for use in a
flight verification program consisting of six shuttle missions. The
first flight set of rocket motors is scheduled for delivery in
1994, and NASA is to phase the new rocket motor into the shuttle
fleet over the next three years. After about 1997, the old shuttle
solid-fueled rocket, manufacturered by Morton Thiokol Co. in Utah,
will no longer be used.
   Lockheed is teamed with Aeroject Space Booster Co. of
Sacramento, Calif., as its principal subcontractor for the rocket
motor, and with Rust International of Birmingham, Ala., as the
facility contractor.

   The governor and 750 other mourners turned
out today to pay tribute to 47 young men who ``died too soon'' in
the nation's worst naval disaster in more than a decade.
   In a brief memorial ceremony, a wreath of 47 carnations was
dropped into the Elizabeth River in honor of the men who were
killed in Wednesday's explosion on the battleship USS Iowa off
Puerto Rico.
   The Navy plans a second service Monday, which President Bush is
to attend.
   Many of the 750 people present today wept as a Navy bugler
played taps and a 21-gun salute boomed into the blue sky.
   Gov. Gerald L. Baliles told the mourners that ``47 young men
died too soon. That is the fact we face. We must accept that, but
we must not forget them. The commonwealth of Virginia and I offer
my deepest sympathy to the families, to the Navy and to the
community.''
   As relatives struggled to deal with their losses, the bodies of
the victims were flown Thursday to Dover Air Force Base in
Delaware, site of a large military mortuary. Some of the bodies
were being identified and shipped to hometowns beginning today.
   The USS Iowa, its forward gun turret damaged, was heading to
Norfolk, its home port, from Puerto Rico.
   ``Even when the tragedy strikes far away from here, it is felt
here. That ship is part of our community,'' Mayor Joe Leafe said
Thursday.
   Meanwhile, Navy chaplains and social workers across the country
tried to help the families.
   ``Words, whatever they are, come empty when you've just told
someone that their husband or loved one is dead,'' said Cmdr. Doug
Palmer, acting base chaplain at the Norfolk Naval Station.
   About 250 family members of the Iowa's 1,600 crewmen gathered in
a base gym Wednesday night awaiting word of their loved ones. About
midnight, the Navy dispatched teams across the country with the bad
news. A Navy officer, accompanied by a chaplain, went to each
family.
   Young Chang Ha, another chaplain, described arriving at a
Norfolk apartment at 3 a.m. Thursday in the company of a Navy
officer in dress blues to tell a woman that her husband was dead.
   ``She said, `Are you sure? Are you sure it is my husband?''' he
said.
   With that the woman began to cry.
   The all-night wait of the parents of Ernest Hanyecz Jr., a
27-year-old gunner's mate first class from Bordentown, N.J., ended
in anger Thursday morning with the news of his death.
   ``As long as they play their war games, there will be more
deaths and innocent people will die,'' said Ernest Hanyecz Sr.
   But in Cleveland, the mother of Clayton Michael Hartwig, said
her family does not blame the Navy for her son's death. Hartwig's
father, Earl, was also a gunner's mate on the Iowa during World War
II.
   ``We're not mad; it was just an unfortunate accident,'' Evelyn
Hartwig said. ``He knew the danger. He often told us how that
powder could go up in nothing flat.''
   Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina, said her brother's death was
difficult because the battleship had been deployed without incident
in the Middle East.
   ``They never even fired their guns in the Persian Gulf for three
months and then they come home, go on war game maneuvers and this
crap has to happen,'' said Ms. Kubicina.
   In Greeneville, Tenn., relatives of Jack E. Thompson Jr. thought
he'd make it out of the Navy alive after he survived Mideast
duties, too.
   But his wife, Leasa, said: ``As soon as I heard it was turret
No. 2, I knew he was dead. I waited and waited, but I knew.''
   Thompson disliked the Navy and was scheduled to complete his
four-year stint in 140 days, his wife said Thursday as she gathered
with his parents and other relatives.
   ``He didn't like being out on the ocean for a long period of
time,'' she said. ``He was an outdoorsman, always hunting and
fishing, and he hated being cooped up. He was just trying to make
the best of it until he got out.''
   ``There is no single solace for all people in times of tragedy
like this,'' said Cmdr. John Mateczun, a Navy psychiatrist who
works with the service's Special Psychiatric Rapid Intervention
Team.
   The only thing certain, he said, is that people involved will
have two emotions: ``One is anger and one is sadness.''
   Teams are dispatched following armed services' disasters to help
the survivors cope. One team was put aboard the Iowa as it stood
off the Puerto Rico coast Thursday morning, unloading the bodies by
helicopter.
   Just as there was anger and sadness as the news made its way to
the families of the victims, the survivors' families felt relief.
   Jackie Hartke of Union in northern Kentucky received a call
about 2 a.m. Thursday from Navy officials that her son, Anthony,
was not on the casualty list.
   ``We feel a little better about the whole situation now, but
until we actually hear from him, we won't feel completely at
ease,'' she said. ``This whole thing has been very trying.''

<HEAD>Maurice Nyagumbo, Independence Leader Linked to Corruption, Dead</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maurice Nyagumbo, a Zimbabwean
independence leader whose implication in a corruption scandal
forced his resignation from President Robert Mugabe's Cabinet, has
died from poisoning. Police sources said Friday they were
investigating the possibility of suicide.
   The 64-year-old Nyagumbo, who died Thursday night, resigned his
posts as senior minister for political affairs and administrative
secretary of the ruling party after he was found by a presidential
inquiry to be involved in a racket involving the selling of cars
and trucks on the black market.
   He was one of the few surviving founders of the Zimbabwe African
National Union (Patriotic Front), the party that waged a seven-year
guerrilla war and led the white-governed British colony of Rhodesia
to independence. Tuesday was the ninth anniversary of Zimbabwe's
independence.
   Nyagumbo was being treated in the intensive care unit of
Harare's Parirenyatwa Hospital after being admitted with
convulsions on Wednesday. The nature of Nyagumbo's illness was
being kept a secret by authorities, but police sources said they
were investigating the possibility he poisoned himself.
   On Thursday, hospital superintendent Sam Mutamba told the
semi-official Zimabwe Inter-African News Agency that Nyagumbo's
condition was stable, but he would not disclose the nature of the
illness.
   Later, as rumors circulated Harare that Nyagumbo had died as a
result of poisoning, the superintendent told Ziana: ``The man is
still alive in this hospital. Do not worry about those rumors
flying around. These are rumors from people who wish him dead.''
   Nyagumbo, who had ranked third-highest in the party hierarchy,
was not invited to the independence celebrations earlier this week.
   He had spent two decades in colonial prisons as an alleged
terrorist and was widely acclaimed by black Zimbabweans as one of
the champions of political emancipation.
   Like most emergent black leaders, Nyagumbo had humble
beginnings. He was a herdboy from a village in the eastern
highlands of Zimbabwe.
   After being educated in neighboring South Africa, where he
waited on tables at whites-only hotels, he became a member of the
local Communist Party. He was expelled in 1955 for links to the
so-called Mau Mau movement that yielded black rule in the British
colony of Kenya.
   At home, under successive white supremacist regimes, he became
more active in his crusade for black rule and spent much of his
adult life behind bars.
   But after independence he held key posts in the Cabinet, the
15-member Politburo and the ruling party's 90-strong central
committee.
   The judicial commission of inquiry set up by Mugabe found
Nyagumbo abused his position by arranging for friends to buy 38
cars and trucks directly from a state assembly plant. Ordinary
Zimbabweans usually have to wait up to 10 years to by a vehicle.
   Judge President Wilson Sandura, who presented his report to
Mugabe on March 11, said he did not believe Nyagumbo arranged the
deals without rewards.
   The minister himself denied receiving kickbacks, but resigned
his posts anyway.
   Nyagumbo was the most senior of six ministers to testify. Four
other ministers, a junior minister and a provincial governor have
all since resigned their posts over links to corruption this month.
   Police say they are considering prosecuting many of the 60
witnesses who gave evidence before Judge President Wilson Sandura.
   There was no comment from Mugabe on the death of his old ally.

   Fire swept through the upper floors of a
four-story apartment building today, killing at least four people,
and a man who confessed to lighting the fire was charged with
murder, authorities said.
   A woman who either fell or jumped from the second floor was
killed, and firefighters by noon had also recovered the bodies of
three men from the ravaged building, Fairmont Police Lt. Ted Offut
said. One person was injured, a man who broke both feet jumping out
of the building and was hospitalized in fair condition.
   Authorities feared they would find at least four more bodies in
the rubble, said Robert Hall, an assistant state fire marshal. A
crane was brought in to begin removing debris as the search for
bodies continued.
   Fairmont Fire Department Capt. Homer Atha said the roof had
fallen into the third floor, making it difficult for firefighters
to look for victims. The building's first floor housed a bar, and
the other three included apartments where eight people lived,
officials said.
   ``Until they geflames out
the back window and the apartnment started filling with smoke.
   ``I tried to get my friend out the back window, but he's so big
and the room was so full of smoke,'' Ledsome said. ``I tried three
times, but he didn't make it. He's still up there.''
   Firefighters had put the fire out three hours after it was
reported about 3:30 a.m., but the blaze started up again on the
roof about 10:45 a.m., forcing an hourlong halt to the search for
more bodies.
   Stuckey said in a signed statement he was feeling depressed and
``had been for a long time.'' Brown said Stuckey was arrested as he
watched the building burn.
   ``He was definitely there when the fire trucks arrived, and he
was there when firefighters were there trying to save people's
lives,'' Brown said.
   Police Chief Edward DeVito said the man is a suspect in at least
one other Fairmont area fire.
   Fairmont is a city of 24,000 in northern West Virginia.
   Brown said Stuckey was jailed without bond pending the
appointment of an attorney and the scheduling of a hearing before
Marion County Circuit Judge Fred Fox.
   Stuckey was charged with the death of the woman who fell from
the building's second floor, Brown said. He said additional charges
would be filed in the other deaths.
   Joe Merendino was among the first officers on the scene after he
saw flames light up the night sky.
   ``We had three people from in back of the building hollering for
help, trying to get out,'' Merendino said. ``We saved two of them
with ladders.''

   Robert Amory Jr., a former deputy director of
the Central Intelligence Agency and retired secretary and general
counsel of the National Gallery of Art, has died of cancer. He was
74.
   Amory, who died Wednesday, joined the CIA in 1952, becoming
deputy director for intelligence the following year.
   He left the CIA in 1962 to become chief of the international
division of the Bureau of the Budget, the forerunner of the Office
of Management and Budget, for three years. He practiced law in
Washington for eight years before taking over the National Gallery
of Art position in 1973. He retired in 1980.
   Amory, a Boston native and a graduate of Harvard University and
Harvard Law School, also was a professor at the law school and
developed its first course on accounting.
   He served in the Army during World War II and was awarded a
Silver Star, Bronze Star and the Legion of Merit.
   He is survived by his wife, Mary Armstrong Amory, two sons and
three grandsons. Services are scheduled for Monday at the
Washington Cathedral.

   NASA on Friday selected Lockheed
Missile Systems Division of Sunnyvale, Calif., to develop a new,
more powerful solid fuel rocket for the space shuttle.
   The space agency is moving ahead on the advanced booster despite
last month's recommendation by a congressional safety panel that it
discontinue the project.
   Lockheed estimated total cost of the seven-year development
project and facility work at more than $1.1 billion. The company's
principal subcontractor is Aerojet Space Booster Co. of Sacramento,
Calif., and its facility contractor is Rust International of
Birmingham, Ala.
   The contract includes an option for 44 sets of two motors each.
The new motor will replace, in the mid-1990s, the current shuttle
booster rocket.
   A faulty booster rocket caused the explosion of the shuttle
Challenger and loss of its seven-member crew in January 1986. The
shuttle fleet was grounded for 32 months while the rocket was
redesigned.
   The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said the new booster should
not be built because it would be too costly and would not be as
reliable as the existing rocket.
   ``We feel there would be an overall degrading of safety,'' said
panel chairman Joseph Sutter, a retired Boeing executive and a
member of the presidential commission that investigated the
Challenger accident.
   The advanced rocket will enable the shuttle to carry 12,000 more
pounds of payload. It currently can lift 50,000 pounds.
   New facilities for the rocket development will be constructed at
Yellow Creek, a site in northeast Mississippi.

   Blushing bureaucrats who pulled a

the artwork to the gallery.
   The review and reversal followed a threat from an ACLU lawyer
representing the artist. Painter Rosa Williamson said she felt
justice had been done after her full-frontal rendition of the first

   ``I feel that City Hall Gallery is a public forum, and I have a

   City officials apparently thought so too _ at least after
receiving a letter Wednesday from lawyer Rebecca Jurado,
threatening to go to court.
   Adam was one of several of Ms. Williamson's nudes moved from a
temporary show because of complaints. And one prankster attached a
fig leaf to Adam, and another male nude was decorated with a rubber
nose.
   City Arts Commission Chairwoman Sandy Blatterman, the one who
ordered the paintings moved, refused to comment.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Pro-Western Spy Rings Broken</HEAD>
<UNK>By ED BLANCHE ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's parliament speaker said Friday the
government has uncovered pro-U.S. spy rings that included agents in
``sensitive places'' and senior naval officers who betrayed Iranian
warship movements.
   Thousands of Shiite Moslem worshipers chanted ``American spies
must be executed!'' after they listened to Hashemi Rafsanjani's
allegations during a sermon at Tehran University.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, reporting on the
speaker's statements, said Rafsanjani alleged the rings were
involved in plots to overthrow Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
fundamentalist government and had been operating as far back as the
1979 Islamic Revolution.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he had no
information on the allegations. ``My information is we don't really
know what they're talking about. They make similar claims every
once in a while about American spies when they need a little
attention.''
   But there is little doubt U.S. intelligence agencies have
operatives in Iran, given the Islamic Republic's deep hostility for
``the Great Satan.''
   Rafsanjani's statements appeared designed to stir up
anti-Western sentiment to deflect attention from political problems
at home.
   The Parliament speaker himself apparently has fallen from favor
since persuading Khomeini to accept an August cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war after a number of Iranian military defeats.
   He said the agents included ``big American spies'' who were
being interrogated, and he said the arrests had exposed the entire
Central Intelligence Agency in the Middle East.
   Some spies were navy personnel who transmitted intelligence on
Iranian naval deployments to the U.S. Navy ``when they were
fighting us in the Persian Gulf,'' Rafsanjani said.
   He said the Iranian ship Iran Ajr, shot up and boarded by U.S.
forces in the gulf on Sept. 21, 1987, while it was planting mines,
was ``betrayed by these very people.''
   Iranian security agents seized ``sophisticated equipment,''
including radio transmitters, code books and even invisible ink
used ``to send messages to the CIA,'' he claimed.
   Rafsanjani did not say how many people had been arrested because
``the Americans should not know how many of them have been trapped.
There are too many.'' He also did not identify any of the accused
naval officers.
   There have been reports three senior naval commanders were
executed in early April for plotting to overthrow the government.
They were identified as Adm. Kianoosh Hakimi, commander of naval
communications and joint operations with the air force; Adm.
Ghahreman Malekzadeh, naval representative at the chief of staff's
office; and Adm. Farhad Riahi, commander of the airborne units.
   Dissident Iranian sources said about 20 other pro-Western navy
officers had been arrested for alleged spying.
   The sources have reported that several commanders of the
Revolutionary Guards have been executed or arrested in recent weeks
for plotting to assassinate Iranian leaders.
   Rafsanjani said ``God's decree will be carried out'' and the
alleged spies would be punished. He did not elaborate. He also said
```we have suffered some catastrophes and some damage'' because of
the spies.
   He said the alleged spies would appear on state-run television
``to explain their activities.'' Rafsanjani did not say when that
would happen, but added: ``You will see that the arrest of so many
spies is unprecedented in contemporary history.''
   Hardliners led by Interior Ministry Ali Akbar Mohtashemi and
Prosecutor-General Mohhamad Musavi Khoeiniha have tightened their
grip on power at the expense of so-called pragmatists like
Rafsanjani, who favor building bridges with the West to end Iran's
isolation.
   That isolation has been enhanced by Khomeini's call for the
death of British author Salman Rushdie, whose latest novel, ``The
Satanic Verses,'' is seen by many as insulting to Islam.
   Even most Moslem countries have refused to support the death
call.
   The political casualties in Iran have included Khomeini's
designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri. He was
dismissed last month after voicing increasing criticism of
Khomeini's policies and the revolution's shortcomings.
   Rafsanjani has sought to ride out the turmoil and has recently
been touring military bases exhorting support for Khomeini.

   A postal clerk was being held without

   Yang was arrested Wednesday after one of the girl's brothers

   About 400 people upset about proposed cuts
in AIDS care and other social service programs today occupied City
Council chambers in a noisy protest, and 12 who refused to leave
were taken into custody.
   The protesters who packed the chamber gallery for a city budget
hearing began climbing over the railings and occupying council
members' seats and the main floor about 20 minutes into the
meeting. No damage was reported.
   Council president Joseph Coleman initially was unable to bring
order and recessed the hearing until the afternoon. When it
resumed, about 40 protesters remained, and 12 of them who refused
to go to the part of the room set aside for the public were
detained.
   The hearing eventually got under way with some protesters
holding signs but not disrupting proceedings. City Solicitor
Seymour Kurland said he was not sure whether the 12 protesters
would be charged.
   One of the 12, Robert Brand, said he was taking part ``to
guarantee that the city passes a budget that doesn't kill people.''
   ``People just came in protesting the budget as it's been
presented,'' Councilman Angel Ortiz said. ``I think it's driving
home the point that the budget is a very mean budget as it's been
described, and it's a budget that needs to be changed.''
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode, who was not present during today's
disturbance, last month proposed a $2.014 billion budget that would
cut spending for the homeless, AIDS and community organizations but
bolsters police and health clinic staffs.
   Joe Rogers, an activist with Project Share, an advocacy group
for the homeless and mentally ill, said activists would attend
every council meeting and budget hearing until the budget is
approved.
   ``We'll be demanding that they develop a human budget, a humane
budget that doesn't cut back at the cost of the poor,'' Rogers said.
   At several points, the crowd broke into chants such as, ``You
say, `Cut back.' We say, `Fight back.'''
   Protesters held up signs including ``AIDS Coalition To Unleash
Power,'' ``Save City Health Services,'' ``What is Brotherly Love
Without Brotherly Care?''

<HEAD>Hawaii Lawmakers Pass On $33 Million Purchase of Coral Atoll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE DUNFORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaii lawmakers have decided not to spend $33
million to buy a coral atoll nearly 1,000 miles to the south, and a
member of the family that owns the property says plenty of other
buyers have expressed interest.
   The Fullard-Leo family of Honolulu had given state lawmakers
until the end of their current legislative session, scheduled to
adjourn Monday, to come up with the money or it would sell the
uninhabited Palmyra atoll to someone else.
   ``If the state doesn't buy it now, I'm sure it's not going to be
here next year,'' said Ainsley Fullard-Leo, 57, the youngest of
three brothers who own the U-shaped string of islets 960 miles
south of Hawaii and 200 miles north of the equator.
   House Finance Committee Chairman Joseph Souki said the Palmyra
was not included in the state budget when it was finalized by House
and Senate conferees on Thursday.
   ``I think it's too expensive anyway,'' he said.
   Told of the Legislature's decision, Fullard-Leo said, ``I think
the state's making a big mistake.''
   Now that the state has passed on it, the family will probably
consider other offers, Fullard-Leo said. Offers in the $30 million
range and higher have come from U.S. and Japanese companies as well
as one unidentified Pacific nation, he said.
   Palmyra has many attractive features, including its status as a
U.S. possession, its deep harbor, an airstrip left over from World
War II and 150 inches of rainfall a year, said Sen. Richard
Matsuura, a strong supporter of purchasing the property.
   It's located in one of the best fisheries in the Pacific and
could serve as a mid-Pacific maritime center, he said.
   University of Hawaii scientists say it is ideal for
oceanographic and marine life research and a possible site for
equatorial space launches.
   Reports of successful room-temperature fusion energy experiments
in which the precious metal palladium was involved prompted
Matsuura to note that Palmyra is near ocean floor manganese crusts
containing palladium.
   Most of the attention from private interests, however, has
focused on building an exclusive resort on the 600 acres of land
within the 8,000-acre reef-protected atoll.

   The state constitution says Louis Peck is
too old to be on Vermont's highest court. Peck disagrees, and
continues to hear and decide cases.
   ``I don't think I should become senile as a matter of law,''
said Peck. ``I might be as a matter of fact, but certainly not of
law.''
   Peck turned 70 in December. According to Vermont's Constitution,
he should have retired at the end of 1988. He did not, believing
the provision violates a federal act that prohibits age
discrimination.
   On his side is an opinion from the state attorney general's
office saying the federal act supercedes the Vermont mandatory
retirement clause. But a recent federal appeals court ruling in
Massachusetts raises new questions about Peck's standing.
   ``We have an attorney general's opinion that concludes Justice
Peck is qualified to sit,'' said Thomas Lehner, the court
administrator. ``Whether the attorney general's opinion is correct
is an open question.''
   The 1974 provision of the state Constitution is clear: ``All
justices of the Supreme Court and judges of all subordinate courts
shall be retired at the end of the calendar year in which they
attain 70 years of age.''
   But in 1986 Congress amended the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967 to prohibit discrimination regardless of
age. Previously, the law did not apply to anyone older than 70.
   In 1987, Peck and Gov. Madeleine Kunin asked the attorney
general's office to review the apparent conflict between the state
Constitution and federal law. In an opinion signed by Attorney
General Jeffrey Amestoy, the office decided the federal law must
prevail.
   ``The supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution makes it clear
federal law controls if there is a conflict,'' said Amestoy.
   But rulings by the attorney general's office do not have the
force of a court decision; they are only advisory. And a federal
court decision in neighboring Massachusetts late last year shows
there is room for disagreement.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, which covers
Massachusetts, said it could not find any evidence in reviewing the
congressional debate on the discrimination statute that Congress
meant for the law to usurp the state power to govern the tenure of
judges.
   ``Without question, the tenure of state judges is a question of
exceeding importance to each state, and a question traditionally
left to be answered by each state,'' the judges said. ``Any federal
encroachment on a state freedom of choice in this area, therefore,
strikes very close to the heart of state sovereignity.''
   Peck feels strongly that age alone is not a good barometer of
ability and noted that justices on the U.S. Supreme Court routinely
serve well past 70.
   ``Oliver Wendell Holmes served very well on the U.S. Supreme
Court until he was well into his 90s,'' Peck said in an interview
this week.
   Peck wants the issue resolved in the courts. But it is unclear
how or when that will happen.
   The Massachusetts ruling has no force in Vermont. Only a ruling
by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Vermont, or by
the U.S. Supreme Court, could end the uncertainty over Peck's
position.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, on behalf of judges
such as Peck across the country, is looking for a case to bring to
the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve the issue, but it may be years
before the country's highest court issues a decision.
   Meanwhile, Peck continues to review cases with the four other
justices. Lehner said it is believed that Peck's rulings will stand
even if a court eventually rules he should have retired at age 70.
   ``Obviously we are concerned because this is an open
situation,'' he said. ``We have talked with Justice Peck about
setting up a federal suit, but right now we are relying on the
attorney general's opinion that he can sit.''
   Peck said he has three more years in his term and would then
have to seek legislative retention to continue on the court. He
said he might consider retiring before his term is up, but only if
the issue is settled.
   ``I am not doing this for my sake,'' he said. ``I'm doing this
for the people who will come after. I am determined to stay on
until this is resolved.''

   A new joint ministerial meeting in the
U.N.-sponsored Iran-Iraq peace talks that had been scheduled for
Friday was delayed until Saturday, a U.N. spokeswoman announced.
   Spokeswoman Nadia Younes said U.N. officials had been in contact
with both parties throughout the day in order to clarify ``certain
things.'' She made no no further comment.
   The new round of joint talks had opened Thursday with what U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said was a preliminary
meeting held in a ``good atmosphere'' without dealing with issues
of substance.
   Statements by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and
his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, made plain that there was little
progress since the talks started Aug. 25, five days after a
cease-fire ended eight years of fighting between the countries.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Law Day Proclamation, Urges Pay Increase for Judges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed a proclamation Friday
declaring May 1 as ``Law Day,'' using the occasion to plug his
proposed pay raise for federal judges to encourage ``the best legal
talent'' for federal benches.
   He said the nation has not yet reached the point where the oath
taken by federal judges _ ``to administer justice without regard to
person, and do equal right to the poor and the rich'' _ is a
reality for all Americans.
   ``Our work is not done _ the work of ensuring that recourse to
justice is within the reach of every individual in this nation. For
the poor especially, the legal process can be a costly, complex and
extremely cumbersome route to the justice that they deserve,'' Bush
said at the White House signing ceremony.
   ``Every citizen's claim should be judged on its merits, not on
the basis of his status, or place or standing in society. It's the
very core of the democratic idea,'' Bush said.
   Speaking to a small group of people involved in the Justice
system, including the American Bar Association president, Bush
plugged his proposal to increase the pay of federal judges by 25
percent, calling that raise long overdue.
   ``We must recruit and retain this nation's best legal talent on
the federal bench ... I urge each of you and all of those out there
listening to give your strongest, possible support to see that that
measure wins quick approval,'' he said.
   In his proclamation, he called on the legal profession, schools,
government agencies, the media and other organizations in society
``to focus public attention on the importance of making access to
justice a reality for all persons.''

   Mark Lane, nationally known for his conspiracy
theories about President Kennedy's assassination, complained Friday
he has been kept from meeting John W. Hinckley Jr. by the mental
hospital where Hinckley has been since shooting President Reagan.
   A judge ruled Thursday that they could meet during regular
visiting hours.
   Lane said he has not decided whether to accept Hinckley's
request that he take on his case.
   However, the lawyer said, ``We had an appointment a couple of
weeks ago and the hospital authorities at the highest level decreed
that I could not meet with Mr. Hinckley. Instead they wanted to
meet with me, pulling together a summit meeting all the powers in
Washington to brief me. ...
   ``I said that was absurd and that if a man wanted to obtain me,
the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship is that it remains
between an attorney and a client.''
   Hinckley told a federal court judge Thursday, in his first
public testimony ever, that he wanted to hire Lane as his attorney
because ``he has done very well'' defending famous criminals.
   He said of the proposed March 28 meeting with Lane, ``On the
morning of the meeting, all of a sudden, it was pulled out from
under me.''
   Hinckley has been at St. Elizabeths mental hospital since his
1982 acquittal by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting of Reagan
and three others.
   Expressing concern that Hinckley might expose himself to
exploitation, hospital authorities had sought court supervision of
his interviews with Lane or other attorneys.
   U.S. District Judge June L. Green overruled the hospital and
granted Hinckley permission to interview Lane or any other lawyer
during visiting hours.
   Lane said he was surprised when Hinckley called him in early
March.
   ``It was a funny conversation. I didn't get his last name
clearly, thought his name was Eakley,'' Lane said, laughing, during
a telephone interview from Daytona Beach, Fla., where he is
representing a man on death row.
   ``I told him I didn't know anything about his case, and he said
it was in all the newspapers.
   ``I had gotten calls from St. Elizabeths patients before who all
said their cases were famous, and I told him I must have missed
those newspapers, please tell me what it's about,'' Lane said.
   During their few telephone conversations, Lane said, Hinckley
told him he wanted to hire him as his attorney, but Lane told him
they had to meet so that Hinckley would know him better and Lane
would learn ``enough about the facts in his case to know if I could
be of assistance to him.''
   During the hearing Thursday, hospital lawyer Janet L. Maher
asked Hinckley whether he knew Lane had written books about
political assassinations and other people he represented.
   ``I don't think it's a crime that he's written these books and
interviewed these people,'' Hinckley said. ``I am sure that the
subjects he has written about at some point gave their consent.''
   ``I am capable of deciding whether I want my story told and it
is not the hospital's say to dictate whether I can do that,'' said
Hinckley.
   In his 1966 book ``Rush to Judgment,'' Lane disputed the
findings of the Warren Commission that Lee Harvey Oswald alone shot
and killed President Kennedy in 1963 in Dallas.
   Hinckley also said he knew that at one time Lane had represented
James Earl Ray, who killed the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   Lane said he has represented clients after writing books on
their cases, including Ray and his current client, James
Richardson, but has ``never written a book as a result of my
representation of a client.''
   He said he has no plans to write a book about Hinckley and that
Hinckley's interest in retaining him was based solely on a desire
for effective legal counsel rather than to collaborate on a book.
   Hinckley has been involved in court matters several times in
recent years in connection with mental institution plans to allow
him to leave for a visit with his family and for an outing with
other patients. The plans were scuttled both times.
   Lane said, ``If the authorities at St. Elizabeths are as careful
in understanding and analyzing Mr. Hinckley's motives and condition
as they are in analyzing my motives for writing a book which I have
no intention to write ... then I think that Mr. Hinckley is
entitled to a new evaluation. If the keepers are nuts, you have to
be very careful about accepting their conclusions.''

   Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 63rd birthday
Friday by conferring honorary colonel in chief titles on two of her
children and two relatives by marriage.
   The title honors an army regiment's achievements by giving it
contact with Buckingham Palace and occasional visits by a royal
figurehead.
   It was the first such title for the queen's second son Prince
Andrew, an active naval officer, and for the Staffordshire Regiment
which he now heads.
   Princess Anne's title was for the London Officer Training Corps
which links London University and the army. She has 10 similar
titles for regiments in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
   The queen's daughter-in-law, Princess Diana, who already held
the title for a British and a Canadian regiment, gained her third
to head the 13th-18th Hussars.
   Its 270-year history spans the 1815 battle of Waterloo, the 1854
charge of the Light Brigade, the Boer War relief of Ladysmith in
1900 and the World War II invasion of Normandy in 1944.
   The Duchess of Gloucester, whose husband is a cousin of the
queen, was made colonel in chief of the Royal Irish Rangers.
   The queen is colonel in chief of 36 regiments.

   Indiana rocker John Cougar Mellencamp
grabbed his car phone as soon as he heard one of the songs from his
soon-to-be-released album being played too early on the radio.
   Mellencamp called Dick Asher, president of Polgram, his record
company, and had him obtain a court order to keep cuts from the
album ``Big Daddy'' off the air.
   Indianapolis radio station WFBQ-FM was playing a different cut
each hour Wednesday even though the official release date is May 4.
   ``Sometimes it's worth breaking the rules a little for an
exclusive, but once we got the cease-and-desist we were legally
obligated to stop playing it,'' said WFBQ program director Michael
Hughes. ``It's just a case of the wrong people _ John himself _

   Entertainer John Denver flew off in
another plane shortly after walking away from his damaged biplane
after landing here.
   The accident occurred after Denver's plane landed Thursday
afternoon on a flight from Carefree, Ariz., to Santa Fe, N.M., with
only Denver aboard, police and Federal Aviation Administration
officials said.
   Denver declined medical treatment and later left on another
plane, Holbrook police spokeswoman Mary Benavidez said.
   An FAA duty officer in Los Angeles said he understood Denver's
plane was damaged when it spun around horizontally, possibly after
being blown by a gust of wind, while taxiing after landing.
   The duty officer, who declined to give his name, said the plane
on which Denver continued his trip to Santa Fe probably was a
charter arranged after the accident.
   Denver's plane was a Waco biplane built in 1931, the duty
officer said. He said he didn't know details of the damage.

   Never mind that most critics consider
Jon Bon Jovi the musical equivalent of the Alaska oil spill. He
says he'll just revel in popular adulation and duck the harpoons.
   Bon Jovi, 27, and his band of the same name, have layered muted
heavy metal music with melodies in such albums as ``Slippery When
Wet,'' which sold 9 million copies in the United States, and ``New
Jersey,'' 4 million.
   With sales like that, you can let the critics take their shots.
   ``I realize that America loves success, and they hate successful
people,'' Bon Jovi, 27, said Tuesday.
   ``Take Mike Tyson, for example. The man's an amazing fighter. I
went to Vegas, I was at the fight. I was screaming for Frank Bruno.
One, because he's a friend of mine, and, two, I wanted Tyson to get
beat.
   ``You read all this stuff in the press about his wife and Don
King, you say, `Oh, man, knock him out, it'll humble him and it
will be great.'
   ``Then I thought, `You're saying it about yourself.' You get to
the top of the heap and people throw stuff at you and you wonder
why.''
   Still, he says he's content to duck and keep grinning.
   ``I don't feel trapped by success. I tell you what _ I dig the
view. Anybody who tells you they don't dig the view is full of it.''

<HEAD>South African Forces to Be Confined to Base Next Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South African forces will be
confined to their bases in northern Namibia for 60 hours next week
so black nationalist guerrillas can withdraw to Angola without
confrontation, the government said Friday.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said the security forces would remain
at their bases from 6 p.m. April 26 until 6 a.m. April 29.
   South Africa plans to obtain cassette recordings from Angolan
officials in which commanders of the South-West Africa People's
Organization guerrillas order their troops to withdraw, said
Defense Minister Magnus Malan. The recordings will be broadcast by
radio and from loudspeakers on aircraft, he said.
   Neither Malan nor Botha said what South Africa would do if
insurgents remained in Namibia after April 29. Malan said South
Africa's response would depend in part on whether it suspected that
SWAPO had established arms caches in Namibia.
   South Africa says 1,600 guerrillas from crossed into Namibia
beginning April 1 in violation of a peace accord that required them
to remain at their bases in Angola until mid-May. The accord is
linked to a United Nations plan to bring independence to the
territory by April 1990 after 74 years of South African rule.
   Territorial officials say 289 guerrillas and 27 security forces
members have been killed in fighting since April 1.
   Most of the fighting occurred during the first week of April,
although three insurgents were reported killed Thursday. The bodies
of six guerrillas killed earlier were found Friday, according to
Police Commissioner Dolf Gouws, who ordered new searches of all
battle sites.
   Territorial police said Friday that about 520 guerrillas
remained in Namibia, indicating that close to 800 guerrillas have
withdrawn.
   U.N. forces in northern Namibia have established assembly points
where guerrillas can report and obtain safe passage to Angola. Only
a handful of insurgents have reported to the checkpoints, with the
others withdrawing on their own.
   U.N. troops are acting as a peacekeeping force during the
one-year plan to conduct free elections leading to Namibia's first
independent, black majority-ruled government. The plan called for
the orderly, unarmed return of guerrillas in mid-May from bases in
Angola and Tanzania.
   SWAPO has been fighting for independence since 1966.
   Botha said the decision to confine South African forces to base
was made after a meeting Thursday involving officials from South
Africa, Angola and Cuba, signatories of a regional peace accord
last December.
   Under the plan, Cuba agreed to withdraw its 50,000 troops from
Angola, where they have helped the Marxist government in a war
against South African-backed rebels.
   Representatives of the three countries agreed that all SWAPO
forces should return to bases at least 100 miles inside Angola,
Botha said.
   The three countries are scheduled to meet again next week in
Cape Town, along with U.S. and Soviet observers.

   Two Haitians accused of hijacking a missionary
group's aircraft to Miami pleaded innocent to air piracy charges
Friday in federal court.
   Fadael Milord, 29, and Berlioze Guillaume, 25, were indicted
Thursday and jailed without bond until trial, which has not been
scheduled.
   Outside the courtroom, Guillaume's court-appointed attorney,
Henry Bugay, told The Associated Press: ``This was not a case of
air piracy. My client was seeking political asylum.''
   Milord's lawyer, Assistant Federal Public Defender Charles
Wishna, said the men were fleeing for their lives.
   At an earlier hearing, the men had said they decided to go to
the United States after passing an airport on the way to the
Dominican Republic on April 10. They were fleeing to the
neighboring country after taking part in a failed coup attempt
against Haitian leader Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, they said.
   They commandeered a twin-engine plane owned by Missionary
Aviation Fellowship of Redlands, Calif., which makes regular runs
from Haiti to Fort Lauderdale, the FBI said.
   ``Our airplane, with our pilot Duer Smedley, had been loading on
the ramp at Cap Haitien on the north coast of Haiti when suddenly
two armed men burst out onto the ramp firing their pistols,'' Jack
Walker, a member of the fellowship, said at the time.
   The men diverted the aircraft to Miami, where they immediately
surrendered. No one was hurt.

<HEAD>Lugar Urges Administration to Show Concern Over Panama Election Situation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration should act now to
focus public attention on alleged efforts by Panama's military
leader to control the upcoming election there and should send
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to inspect U.S. troops protecting the
canal, Sen. Richard Lugar said Friday.
   Lugar, an Indiana Republican who is a former chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that ``the Bush
administration is already behind in the game, but it's not to late
to marshal public opinion to at least make sure this vitally
important election doesn't pass by unnoticed on page 12 of a few
newspapers.''
   Lugar said chances for free and fair elections in Panama on May
7 now appear to be remote because of control over the process
exercised by that country's military leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The senator said Cheney should visit the U.S. Southern Command
in Panama within the next two weeks to highlight U.S. concern over
the elections and to demand a halt to escalating attacks on
American military personnel by forces loyal to Noriega.
   The United States should also make clear now, he said, that
economic sanctions against Panama could be strengthened if the
elections are perceived as unfair.
   The White House should also declare that the sanctions could be
removed altogether if fair play prevails, he said.
   ``Noriega has clearly decided that controlling this election
with overwhelming strong-arm tactics is more important than
appearing legitimate to the world through victory in a free and
fair election,'' Lugar told a news conference.
   ``He is trying to scuttle efforts by the Center for Democracy to
help the world watch the election through the press,'' Lugar said.
   Noriega also is tightening restrictions on travel to the country
and limiting hotel space to prevent the attendance of reporters and
international observers, the senator said.
   Lugar complained that the Bush administration has been show to
act on the Panama matter. ``There seems to be no particular
direction in our government to do anything about it,'' Lugar said.
``The situation seems to be going glimmering very rapidly.''
   ``It seems to me important that Noriega's hand be called,''
Lugar said. ``Panama cannot remain on the back burner.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said the United States
will make no accommodation with Noriega who is under indictment in
the United States for alleged narcotics trafficking.
   Lugar said the election thus poses an opportunity for Panama to
rid itself of Noriega and return to democratic rule in the decade
remaining before the canal is turned over to the government of
Panama under the terms of the Panama Canal treaties.

<HEAD>Soviet Pullout From Hungary Starts Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will begin the partial
withdrawal of 10,000 of its estimated 62,000 troops in Hungary on
Tuesday, the commander of the Kremlin's forces in the country said
Friday.
   Col.-Gen. Matvei Burlakov said the pullout will involve 22 units
comprising more than 10,000 men, 450 tanks, 200 pieces of artillery
and 3,000 vehicles.
   The pullouts are part of the withdrawal of 50,000 men and 5,000
tanks from Eastern Europe announced by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in December.
   Soviet troops begin partial withdrawal from East Germany and
Czechoslovakia next month, Burlakov said.
   He said the withdrawal will begin with the departure of
artillery and missiles from the Soviets' 13th tank division in
western Hungary.
   Troop pullouts begin May 15, he added, followed by the departure
of a training tank regiment June 5, and the pullout of an air
defense regiment starting June 20, he said.
   A fighter regiment will leave by Dec. 1, while the withdrawal of
airborne forces and a non-commissioned officers' training school
will go ahead next year, he added.
   Burlakov said some 8,000 conscripts and around 2,000 officers
will return to the Soviet Union from Hungary.
   Those nearing retirement will be pensioned off, but others will
be redeployed on Soviet territory, he said.
   According to figures published in Hungary, there are 62,000
Soviet troops in Hungary.
   Burlakov declined to give a figure, saying only that the pullout
affects roughly one-quarter of all Soviet units in Hungary.
   The withdrawals will be accompanied by a shift of Soviet troops
stationed near the border with Austria to points further east,
Burlakov said.
   Asked whether this meant the Soviet Union now sees little chance
of an attack on the Warsaw Pact through neutral Austria, Burlakov
replied, ``We would like to create a zone of peace between the
Warsaw Pact and NATO.''
   Austria is not a member of the Western military alliance or the
Soviet-led bloc.
   Increasingly vocal demands have recently come from Hungary's
indepedent groups for Hungarian neutrality.
   Asked whether he could envision this with Hungary either leaving
or remaining in the Warsaw Pact, Burlakov replied, ``I think the
competent, high-ranking organs of the Warsaw Treaty ... will take a
decision about that.''
   ``We would all like to carry this decision out when the time
comes that such a decision is formally made,'' he said.
   Replying to another question, however, he made clear that he
could not envisage complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Hungary unless NATO made similar steps.
   At the East-West talks in Vienna on reducing conventional arms
in Europe, Moscow has said it is willing to pare down to a purely
defensive force by 2001, but only if NATO makes reductions the
Western alliance says would shift the military balance of power in
the East's favor.

   The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the
government to pay $50 a month to heirs of about 2,000 adults who
died in the 1984 Bhopal gas leak, news reports said.
   The United News of India said a three-judge panel passed the
order while hearing petitions seeking interim relief for the
survivors of the Dec. 2, 1984 disaster, which has been described as
the world's worst industrial accident.
   More than 3,400 people were killed and at least 20,000 injured
when toxic methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a pesticide factory
operated by the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide Corp. in the
central city of Bhopal.
   The Danbury, Conn.-based multinational was ordered to pay $470
million compensation to the victims after a Supreme
Court-supervised settlement in February. The settlement was reached
during the hearing of a $3 billion damage suit filed by the
government.
   Disbursal of the money was held up after several petitions in
the Supreme Court challenged a law empowering the government to
become the sole representative of the victims. The petitions are
being heard by a different panel than that which made Friday's
decision.
   The $50 monthly relief will be deducted from the compensation
awarded later, UNI said.

   Heavy rains and floods have left
46,000 people homeless in Ceara state in northeastern Brazil, civil
defense authorities said Friday.
   The Jaguaribe River, one of Ceara's main rivers, overflowed its
banks and left 7 feet of water in fields and towns in nine
municipalities, according to civil defense worker Socorro Martins.
   ``The crops are lost and there are serious outbreaks of
pneumonia, fever and diarrhea,'' Miss Martins said by telephone
from Fortaleza, the Ceara state capital 1,700 miles northeast of
Rio de Janeiro.
   The homeless, mostly poor rural workers, were being put up in
schools, government buildings and canvas tents, she said.
   Gov. Tasso Jereissati declared a state of emergency in the nine
affected townships, Miss Martins said.
   Although it is the rainy season in the usually arid northeast,
showers have fallen almost without letup since February, Miss
Martins said. More rain was forecast in the coming days.

   The 5-year-old girl injured by a pipe bomb
at a discount store was eating a frozen orange Twin Pop Friday and
planning a trip to a hospital playroom after her condition was
upgraded from fair to satisfactory.
   Doctors at Methodist Hospital said Erin Bower has been
recovering steadily since Monday night, when a bomb concealed in a
toothpaste container exploded in her hand in a suburban K mart.
   ``She is more alert today,'' said Jon J. White, a hospital
spokesman. ``She is out of the bed, but she is not yet walking
around. She is in a wheelchair.''
   Surgeons were not able to save her left hand, but said Thursday
that the prognosis looked good for her left eye, which was damaged
in the blast.
   ``The only pain she's experiencing is in the stomach, related to
the injuries of the explosion _ cuts and abrasions,'' White said.
   Doctors planned to examine the eye again next week before
determining when the child might be released from the hospital.
   Investigators continued their search for two men seen leaving
the K mart shortly after the blast, and a man clerks say bought BBs
at the store last Friday. Witnesses said the purchaser matches the
description of one of the two men.
   The investigation has been hampered by a flurry of unfounded
bomb threats, including one that emptied another Indianapolis K
mart Thursday night, Sheriff Joseph McAtee said.

<HEAD>Famed Anthropologist Named Kenya Wildlife Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Leakey, a famed anthropologist and
critic of Kenya's effort to protect its big game animals, has been
named to head the country's Department of Wildlife Conservation and
Management.
   The announcement Thursday evening by the office of President
Daniel T. arap Moi was seen as another indication of the
government's resolve to protect its wildlife from poachers and
mismanagement.
   Tourists, many of them attracted by the lure of seeing
elephants, lions, rhinoceres and other animals in the country's 38
national parks, game preserves and sanctuaries, pumped more than
$130 million into Kenya last year.
   Leakey replaces Perez Olindo, with whom he feuded publicly last
year along with George Muhoho, the minister for tourism and
wildlife. Claiming some government officials were involved in
elephant poaching, Leakey accused the pair of paying ``lip
service'' to wildlife conservation.
   Muhoho, whose ministry oversees the wildlife department, in turn
called Leakey a ``cheeky white'' and termed his accusations false.
But the government later acknowledged that poaching, particularly
of elephants and rhinos, had reached crisis proportions.
   In the first half of 1988 alone, 92 elephants were said to have
been killed for their ivory tusks and Moi ordered police and game
rangers to shoot poachers on sight. The crackdown brought the
deaths of numerous poachers and some law enforcement officers.
   In the last year, gunmen also have ambushed and opened fire on
tourist vehicles in game parks in southern and central Kenya,
wounding several tourists.
   The announcement of Leakey's appointment offered no explanation
for the move nor did it say whether Olindo was being given a new
government assignment.
   Leakey, 45, is director of Kenya's National Museum and has
served as chairman of the country's Wildlife Society. A native
Kenyan, he is the son of the late Louis and Mary Leakey, themselves
famed anthropologists.

Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush plans to propose a national
youth service program based on volunteerism, Energy Secretary James
D. Watkins told a Senate panel Friday.
   Watkins said the president would send proposed legislation to
Congress in a month outlining such a program to be based solely on
volunteerism because ``civic obligation'' rather than financial
incentive should be the motivation.
   Bush's program, to be known as Youth Entering Service, would be
aimed at people aged 5 to 25 ``to instill ... the notion that
service to others is a necessary part of any definition of a
successful life,'' Watkins told the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee.
   ``Through YES, young people will not be financially compensated
by the federal government for their service,'' said Watkins, adding
that the major ``motivation for service should be a sense of civic
obligation rather than the promise of remuneration.''
   Watkins said details of Bush's plan were still being worked out.
He offered no immediate examples of how the system would work but
he said the efforts would be tied in some way to service in local
communities.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the committee chairman, said
the appearance by Watkins ``is the first time that the Bush
administration has testified before the Congress on the subject of
national service.'' Kennedy chided the administration for delaying
participation thus far in the legislative action.
   The committee is considering nine national service bills,
including a controversial proposal by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., linking
government financial aid for college students to military or
civilian service.
   ``Federal policy should enhance educational opportunities, not
trade one important interest against another,'' said Gregory A.
Humphrey, director of legislation for the American Federation of
Teachers, in opposition to the Nunn bill.
   Echoing that sentiment, Leon Horne, a member of the executive
committee of the National Education Association, the nation's
largest union of teachers, said such an approach would ``undermine
equal educational opportunity for students from low- and lower
middle-income families.''
   Stanley Hill, international vice president for the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, told the
committee that minorities and women also ``stand the most to lose
from a large-scale community service program'' because they are
concentrated in the lower-level job categories most likely to be
displaced by national service activities.
   The committee also heard testimony from two high school
students, Cynthia Brown of Philadelphia and Jacqueline Loso of
South Burlington, Vt., who described their participation in
existing youth service programs. They advised that financial
assistance to develop new or maintain current programs was the most
helpful federal government role in encouraging voluntary service.

   Moslem guerrillas fired at least 12
rockets into the capital on Friday, and initial reports said at
least two people were killed.
   Afghan soldiers returned fire, launching a barrage of missiles
into the mountains east of Kabul.
   The exchange of fire continued for about two hours. It was the
biggest strike on the capital since April 15, when 11 rockets were
fired, killing at least three people.
   The guerrillas, known as the mujahedeen or Islamic holy
warriors, are waging a war to oust the pro-Soviet government. The
rebels are supported by Pakistan, the United States, Saudi Arabia
and China.
   Rebel rockets struck the Soviet Embassy on Thursday, shattering
windows but causing no casualties, according to Soviet diplomats
who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said they did not believe
the strike, from about 20 miles northwest of the capital, was
deliberate.
   The United States closed its embassy in Kabul before Soviet
troops completed their withdrawal Feb. 15. Since then, Moslem
insurgents have attacked Kabul intermittently but have concentrated
their firepower on the strategic eastern city of Jalalabad.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Pakistan, reported Thursday that rebel
rocket attacks on Jalalabad had killed two people. The guerrillas
reportedly were blasting the city from key positions to the south
and east, said Radio Kabul. The radio also said four people were
hurt Thursday when rockets landed in Kabul.
   Jalalabad's fall would be considered a major victory for the
rebels. It would be the biggest city they have captured and would
be a major blow to the morale of the government. Western observers
also have predicted a domino effect, ending with the capital of
Kabul.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to back the
government and withdrew the last of their troops in February under
a U.N.-mediated accord.

   The Air Force mismanaged development of the
nation's satellite tracking and warning system, contend
congressional investigators who are calling on lawmakers to stop
funding for the $437 million project until problems are resolved by
the Pentagon.
   ``The Air Force has invested over $235 million in a system that
is now more than four years behind schedule and far from meeting
its required operational capability,'' the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said in a report.
   The GAO evaluated the service's attempts to modernize the U.S.
Space Command's space surveillance and attack assessment subsystem,
known as the Space Defense Operations Center.
   The system, which is located at the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force
Station in Colorado Springs, Colo., is a data processing and
communications center designed to monitor about 10,000 man-made
objects in space, provide warnings of any military attack in space
and protect satellites from attack.
   The subsystem is considered key to the operation of the North
American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, which is responsible
for alerting the United States and Canada if North America is under
air, missile or space attack.
   The GAO said that over a five-year period the Air Force ignored
warnings from technical contractors that ``the program would have
difficulty achieving its requirements.''
   Specifically, the contractor expressed concerns about the
system's security design, deficiencies in the model used to predict
performance and overall software design quality.
   In response to the report, which was released this week, the
Defense Department admitted that the initial phase of the system
``cannot perform 14 of 23 originally required missions.''
   But the department said it believes the Air Force ``has taken
the necessary action to ensure that the later phases of the ...
program avoid the pitfalls that have hampered the effort to date.''
   The Air Force plans to spend about $437 million on the project,
a substantial increase over its original estimate of $290 million.
Previous estimates that the entire system would be operating by
June 1988 also have changed.
   The Air Force says the system will not be completed until fiscal
1994.
   The GAO urged Congress to withhold additional funds for the
project until the Defense Acquisition Board and Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney have approved plans to meet the investigators'
recommendations.

   The sailors who survived the explosion
aboard the USS Iowa will need help coping with what may be the
first tragedy many of them have experienced, two psychiatrists said
Friday.
   Forty-seven crewmen, most of whom were in their early 20s, died
in the fiery explosion of a gun turret Wednesday as the battleship
took part in training exercises near Puerto Rico.
   ``Many aboard the ship are younger and may not have had to
experience grief before,'' said Navy psychiatrist Cmdr. John
Mateczun, who works with the Portsmouth-based Special Psychiatric
Rapid Intervention Team, or SPRINT.
   ``They won't have a model and may feel they can't have certain
emotions or can't cry. They may feel some shame.''
   ``It's a whole developmental task that is new for them,'' said
Dr. Jack Corazzini, director of university counseling services at
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.
   Initial reactions to the tragedy by surviving crew members may
include shock and disbelief, relief they weren't killed, and guilt
over being alive when companions are not, Corazzini said. He said
it is important that the survivors talk about their feelings to
ward off problems later.
   A SPRINT team of mental health professionals boarded the Iowa
when it anchored off Puerto Rico to remove the bodies of the dead.
The team works with those at greatest risk of suffering from the
tragedy, Mateczun said, including friends of the men killed and
those whose lives were in the greatest danger during the explosion
and fire.
   ``A lot of what we do is educational,'' he said. ``We want to
give people information about what normal human reaction is to
extremely abnormal events.
   ``When people start talking about emotions, then others can say,
`Gee, I felt that way too.' Then they're no longer isolated. They
can say, `I was scared, I was afraid I was going to die,' and know
this is a normal human response. That has terrific therapeutic
value.''
   Follow-up counseling is crucial, both psychiatrists said.
   Corazzini said six months or six years later, an event that
triggers a memory of the tragedy will cause ``pain just like it was
yesterday'' among survivors.
   ``The 19th of April will forever be in these people's hearts and
minds,'' he said. ``It's not like you're ever cured of the grief,''
said Mateczun.

   China's seven-month austerity program has managed
to keep a lid on economic growth but has yet to solve problems of
inflation, overspending and excess investment, the government said
Friday.
   Zhang Zhongji of the State Statistical Bureau said industrial
output value for the first quarter of 1989 increased by 10.4
percent to $79 billion.
   That was well down from an industrial growth rate of more than
20 percent in 1988, although the March growth rate surged to 14
percent after two straight months in the 8 percent range.
   ``We have achieved initial results'' in cooling off the economy,
Zhang said. But he added that inflation is still too high,
``contradictions'' in the economy are worsening and restoring
economic order ``is still very difficult.''
   The government in September announced that for a two-three year
period there would be severe restrictions on new credit, cutbacks
in government spending and cancellations of construction projects.
It said economic reforms, including price reforms, would be put off
until inflation and excessive growth are overcome.
   Zhang said retail prices were unchanged from February to March,
but were up 27.9 percent compared with the same period last year.
The inflation rate has been over 30 percent in most Chinese cities
during the past year.
   Retail sales were up 22.6 percent to $56.4 billion, he said.
   Zhang said the government's drive to boost grain production
after four straight disappointing harvests appeared to be going
well. He said national funding for agricultural production was up
31.3 percent in the first quarter, to $746 million.
   But the economy continued to be plagued by what Zhang called the
``three highs and two irrationals.''
   The highs were inflation, government spending and the soaring
growth of consumer demand. He said government offices have ignored
demands for spending cutbacks, and that spending increased 16.3
percent in the first quarter while revenues were up only 4.9
percent.
   Zhang said the surplus purchasing power of households has hit
$135 billion and that worker bonuses and allowances were up 39 and
59 percent despite the austerity drive.
   The ``irrationals'' were the continued growth of inefficient and
non-productive industries and misplaced investment.
   Energy-wasting, consumer-oriented industries continue to lead
growth, while state-run basic and heavy industries lag behind, he
said. Production of color TV sets was up 53 percent, refrigerators
by 50 percent and cassette recorders by 22 percent.
   Electricity output, meanwhile, was up only 3 percent, coal 5.6
percent and crude oil output fell slightly. Factories have had to
cut back operating hours because of an increasingly serious energy
shortage.
   Although state investment in capital construction projects
dropped 8.3 percent to $2 billion, local governments increased
spending by 14.8 percent to $1.56 billion.
   Zhang said many local governments have taken a ``wait-and-see''
approach to Beijing orders to cancel or postpone construction
projects.
   Zhang said foreign trade on a customs statistics basis was up
15.5 percent in the first quarter to $21.2 billion. Exports were up
9.4 percent to $9.66 billion, and imports by 21.3 percent to $11.5
billion.
   He said the government had had little success in stopping the
import of luxury consumer items such as cars, motorcycles, cameras
and appliances.

   The army and police blocked hundreds of Arabs
from attending Friday prayer services in Jerusalem, and armed
Jewish settlers marched in the occupied West Bank to demonstrate
Israeli control over the land.
   Nineteen Palestinians, including a 3-year-old boy, were reported
wounded in stone-throwing clashes with soldiers in the occupied
territories.
   Arab doctors at Al-Ittihad Hospital in the West Bank city of
Nablus said the boy was hit in the head with a rubber bullet. They
said he was in moderate condition.
   The most violent confrontation was reported in the Gaza Strip
town of Rafah, where 10 Palestinians were reported shot and
wounded. They included a 12-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl,
both shot in the chest.
   A 20-year-old man shot in the chest in the Jabaliya refugee camp
was reported in critical condition, hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed two wounded.
   The army said a 17-year-old Palestinian was killed Thursday
night when he was hit by plastic bullets during a clash with troops
in the Gaza Strip.
   His death raised to at least 440 the number of Palestinians
killed in the 16-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Eighteen Israelis have died.
   Soldiers and police manned checkpoints on main roads leading
into Jerusalem from Ramallah, Bethlehem and Jericho, blocking
hundreds of Arabs from entering the city for weekly Moslem prayers.
   Some elderly Palestinians were allowed to proceed, Arab
witnesses said.
   Police checked identity cards at entrances leading to the main
mosques in Jerusalem's Old City, and dozens of residents of the
occupied territories were turned away.
   Security has been tightened around the main mosque compound _
known to Arabs as Haram Al Sharif, or ``Noble Enclosure'' _ since a
rock-throwing protest broke out there after Moslem prayers April 7
and spilled over to the adjacent Western Wall.
   The Western Wall, or Wailing Wall, is Judiasm's holiest site.
   Haram Al Sharif, which houses the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa
mosques, is one of Islam's holiest sites.
   No disturbances were reported Friday, and Jerusalem Police
Commissioner Yosef Yehudai attributed this to increased police
security and an effort by Moslem elders to control the crowd.
   ``It is in their interest to control the situation,'' Yehudai
said.
   About 900 extra policemen and paramilitary police were posted
around the Moslem shrines, including sharpshooters on rooftop
posts. Israeli media reports estimated 5,500 Moslems attended
prayers, compared to 25,000 when the rioting broke out April 7.
   Since capturing the Old City from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war, Israel has taken pride in guaranteeing free access to all
religious sites. But senior military officials said it has become
necessary to limit access to the mosque compound to avert violence.
   About 300 Jews were seen praying at the Western Wall, and
observers said this was fewer than usual during the weeklong
Passover holiday, when Jews mark the ancient Israelites' escape
from slavery in Egypt.
   Shortly after Moslem prayers concluded, about 30 Jews from the
Gush Etzion settlements near Bethlehem marched up to the Western
Wall behind six Israeli flags.
   Several were armed with Uzi submachine guns and M-16 automatic
rifles, which they kept over their shoulders as they broke into a
dance just outside the barricade at the shrine. They left quietly
after praying at the wall.
   On their approach to Jerusalem, the settlers, accompanied by
police and army cars, passed through the city of Bethlehem in the
occupied West Bank.
   ``This is a walk to show that Jews can walk throughout the land
of Israel without fear, that this is our country,'' said Mark Zell,
36, a lawyer who immigrated to Israel from Washington. ``It's a
response to what happened in the last 16 months.''
   But Jamal, a 35-year-old Palestinian who watched the settlers
pass, said: ``They want to show us that this is ther land, but they
have to carry all these guns. It shows that they are afraid of
us.'' He refused to give his family name.
   Jamal was standing among 10 Arab men, several of whom said they
were prevented by the army from going to Jerusalem for Friday
prayers.

   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski will visit
Britain, probably in June, the foreign secretary said Friday.
   Sir Geoffrey Howe indicated the forthcoming visit by Jaruzelski
was part of a series of contacts between Britain and East European
countries now embarking on reforms.
   He welcomed moves toward greater democracy in Poland and the
legalization of the independent trade union Solidarity.
   At a dinner, the foreign secretary also suggested Britain was
ready to offer unspecified help to Poland.
   ``We believe that Poland has taken a decisive step forward. And
so in the weeks and months ahead if that progress is sustained we
shall be identifying with our friends, allies and the various
international bodies concerned the positive ways in which we can
help,'' Howe said.
   He renewed his warning that ``hard-headed calculation'' was
still needed when evaluating changes taking place in the Soviet
Union.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Poland in November 1988.

   The pilot and surviving crew of the Aloha
Airlines jetliner that ripped open over Hawaii a year ago received
awards for heroism Friday as a federal agency neared the end of its
investigation of the incident.
   The pilot of the now-scrapped Boeing 737, Robert Schornstheimer,
credited ``incredible luck'' for his being able to land the plane
safely after a 20-foot section of fuselage tore away last April 28.
Chief flight attendant Clarabelle Lansing was flung out of the
airliner to her death, but all 95 other people aboard survived.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has tentatively set May
9 for final discussion of possible causes of the incident and
recommendations to prevent it from happening again. The Federal
Aviation Administration has already issued several orders for
increased inspections, repairs and replacements as a result of that
and other problems with older aircraft.
   Schornstheimer, accepting the Aeroclub of Washington award from
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, said new airliners should
not be designed with so much sophisticated technology that it gets
in the way of a pilot flying manually in an emergency.
   ``Once programmed by pilots, state-of-the-art aircraft computers
can almost auto fly the airplane from one airport to another. We
must consider what would have happened to our aircraft without
humans not only being at the controls but with maintained
proficiency to fly it,'' Schornstheimer said.
   ``Pilots do not like to be totally reliant on these
ever-more-complex systems,'' he said.
   Also receiving awards were the flight's first officer, Madeline
``Mimi'' Tompkins, who is now an airline captain, and flight
attendants Michelle Honda and Jane Sato-Tomita. The club, which was
founded in 1909 to foster interest in aviation, also gave a
posthumous award to Ms. Lansing.
   Skinner read a letter to the crew from President Bush which said
their feat ``speaks eloquently of the strength of the human
spirit.'' The crew has received other awards and met with Bush last
year when he was vice president.
   ``Men and women around the globe will long remember that
miraculous landing and the bravery and skill that you ...
demonstrated on that fateful day,'' Bush wrote.
   Skinner, at the end of the ceremony, said that despite the
incident which has increased concern over aging airliners, travel
by plane is still one of the safest modes of transportation and
U.S. air travel is ``the safest in the world.''

   The U.S. military does not have an oil
skimming vessel as large as the 425-foot long Soviet ship
Vaidagubski, but has sent a fleet of smaller vessels to the cleanup
effort off the coast of Alaska, Pentagon spokesmen said Friday.
   The Army has dispatched two specially fitted dredges to help
skim the oil, the Essayons, 350-feet long, and the Yaquina, 200
feet long, said Ed Greene, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, which owns the vessels.
   The Yaquina, based in Portland, Ore., reached the stricken area
on Wednesday and has collected an estimated 1,500 tons of oil, said
Maj. Kathy Wood, a Pentagon spokeswoman. The Essayons, based in San
Francisco, is being sent to the tip of the Kenai Peninsula, she
said.
   The Navy has 22 smaller skimmers at work off the Alaskan coast,
said Wood.
   Each skimmer is 36 feet long and 12 feet wide. Two boats pull
each skimmer and a 300-foot oil boom through the water. Every hour,
the skimmer can suck up 3,600 gallons of liquid, which is collected
in a bladder and can be pumped into another ship or replaced with
another bladder, said Wood.
   Additionally, a Navy amphibious transport dock, the USS Juneau,
is en route and expected to arrive at Prince William Sound on
Monday, Wood said. The Juneau, 570 feet long and 84 feet abeam, is
equipped with two CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, can house 900
people and has been loaded with oil skimming, dredge and bladder
materials.
   ``It will provide a command and control capability in the sound
which we do not currently have,'' said Wood.
   The Army Corps of Engineers has two dredges that are larger than
the Essayons and Yaquina, the Wheeler, 409 feet long, stationed in
the Gulf of Mexico, and the McFarland, 300 feet long, stationed on
the Atlantic Coast.
   The Coast Guard, which has taken over direction of the cleanup
effort, has not requested use of the McFarland or the Wheeler, said
Greene. Both would need to be fitted with special equipment to skim
oil, and would require ``many days'' to transit the Panama Canal
and reach the Alaskan coast, he said.
   The first two Navy skimmers on the scene were flown in a C-5
transport plane from Travis Air Force Base, Calif., arrived there
on March 27, three days after the spill, and began work on March 28.

   Cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13
leading beef states totaled 9.68 million head as of April 1, up 3
percent from a year ago and 10 percent more than two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Only Arizona, Illinois, Nebraska and Washington showed declines
from a year ago, while increases were reported in California,
Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Texas. South
Dakota was reported as unchanged.
   Marketings of fed cattle for slaughter during January, February
and March totaled 5.6 million head, down 4 percent from the same
period of 1988 and 3 percent below the figure for that period in
1987, the report said.
   But the placement of new cattle and calves on feed during the
first quarter of the year totaled 6.21 million head, up 7 percent
from last year and 9 percent more than two years ago.
   That was the largest first-quarter placement of cattle in
feedlots in 18 years, the report said.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 6.09 million head
during April, May and June, up 4 percent from last year's second
quarter and 8 percent more than in 1987, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of April
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

honoring her for longtime support of research and education in such
areas as cancer, heart disease and cerebral palsy.
   Bush, in a Rose Garden presentation ceremony, told Mrs. Lasker
she was an example of what he means when he speaks of ``1,000
points of light'' as the many components of society that work to
improve life for everyone.
   ``We're here today to honor a veritable beacon of light, a woman
who has focused an enormous amount of energy on finding solutions
to life-threatening diseases.
   Mrs. Lasker and her husband in 1942 founded the Albert and Mary
Lasker Foundation to encourage medical research and public
awareness of crippling diseases.
   She urged the president to beef up support for the National
Institutes of Health, where the Mary W. Lasker Center for Health
Research and Education conducts medical research.
   ``We look to you now, Mr. President, for leadership and helping
to support at the National Institutes,'' she said. ``Cancer still
kills 500,000 people a year in this country, more people than have
been killed in all our wars combined.''
   Mrs. Lasker also has been involved in beautification efforts in
Washington, and has donated more than 1 million daffodil bulbs for
Rock Creek Park and Lady Byrd Johnson Park, the White House said.
   The medal she was awarded Friday was voted by Congress, and was
struck by the U.S. Mint.

   The rifles fired 21 times, the Navy bugler
played taps and a wreath of 47 yellow carnations was cast into the
Elizabeth River on Friday to remember the 47 men of the USS Iowa
who died at sea.
   There were few dry eyes among the more than 750 people who
gathered on the waterfront with Gov. Gerald L. Baliles and
representatives from the eight cities in the Hampton Roads area.
   ``With this ceremony, we wish to touch hands with our Navy
friends and share as best we can their very deep anguish and
grief,'' Norfolk City Manager James B. Oliver Jr. said to start the
brief ceremony, organized by the city.
   The sailors died Wednesday after an explosion rocked one of the
battleship's huge gun turrets during exercises in the Caribbean.
   ``There was a time, 45 years or more ago, when this community
recoiled from news of death at sea nearly every day,'' Baliles told
the crowd of civilians and military. ``The sailors of the United
States Navy gave their lives to prevail in war.
   ``But these are peaceful times and we're not used to such
tragedy. We do not expect it ... and it leaves us even more deeply
saddened. On the USS Iowa, 47 young men died too soon. That is the
fact we face. ... We accept it, but we will not forget it.
   ``We will remember, and honor and grieve as a nation,'' he said.
   Mayors or delegates from each of the cities, the Navy and the
Chamber of Commerce presented wreaths to honor the dead.
   The crowd stood in silence as a Navy-Marine Corps color guard
led Baliles and Norfolk Mayor Joseph Leafe carrying the wreath of
yellow carnations from the state onto the pier. As they cast the
wreath onto the water, a police honor guard of seven riflemen fired
three volleys from a knoll just north of the gathering.
   When the last echo of the final volley died, a single Navy
bugler in dress whites stepped from the crowd lining a portico
above the gathering.
   Over the strains of taps, sobs could be heard from those in the
crowd.
   ``These are my shipmates in disaster and distress,'' said Jim
Smith of Norfolk, who attended the service. A vice president of
Branch 5 of the Fleet Reserve Association, the 63-year-old Smith
was one of many veterans in the crowd.
   ``I served aboard the battleship North Carolina in 1946. I know
about those big guns. At times like this, everyone seems to pull
together, we become one family,'' he said.
   Joan Taplett was there with her 3-year-old son, Paul, who sat in
the sunshine eating ice cream. Mrs. Taplett said it was important
for her and for her son to be there. Her husband is commanding
officer of the frigate USS Glover.
   ``There really is a sense of family in the Navy. My son won't
remember this, but I will always, and I can tell him about these
men who gave their lives for the defense of country _ so they won't
be forgotten,'' she said.
   ``I'm from South Dakota... When I heard that one of the men
killed was from there, I had to come. It's a small state. He came
from a small town,'' she said.
   David L. Hanson, a 23-year-old electrician's mate 3rd class from
Bison, S.D., was among those killed. Bison has a population of 457.
   ``I guess I'm here for his parents. Something like this touches
all of us... it reaches into little towns all over the country,''
she said.
   Paul asked his mother why her hand _ holding his cup of ice
cream _ was shaking. ``It's just from the cold, honey,'' she said.
   With the end of the ceremony, the Navy began its planning of a
service for the Iowa's crew and families at the Norfolk Naval
Station, tentatively set for 9 a.m. Monday.
   President Bush is expected to attend. Friday, Bush ordered all
flags to be flown at half staff in memory of the dead. Flags in the
Hampton Roads area have been at half staff since the explosion.

<HEAD>Sakharov Completes Comeback With Congressional Victory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, sent
into internal exile for criticizing the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan, completed his political rehabilitation by winning a
seat in the new national legislature.
   Sakharov's election to the Congress of People's Deputies ``will
be a great success for perestroika,'' said one of his backers,
Alexander Sobianen, using the word for President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reform program.
   Sakharov's victory was among the results of balloting Thursday
by members of the prestigious Academy of Sciences for 12 seats in
the new parliament.
   Also elected were space scientist Roald Z. Sagdeev, economist
Nikolai Shmelev and Georgy A. Arbatov, director of the U.S.A. and
Canada Institute, the official Tass news agency reported Friday.
   Tass said Shmelev, who has proposed radical solutions to the
Soviet Union's economic problems, won the most votes, 869 of 1,101.
Sakharov received 806 and Sagdeev received 739, it said.
   Sakharov, Sagdeev and Shmelev were among a slate of reformers on
the list of 28 candidates. Other reformers who won election were
Vitaly Ginzburg and Yuri Karyakin, Tass said.
   The 2,250-member congress is to meet for the first time on May
25 to choose from among its members the country's president and a
Supreme Soviet, which will make policy for the nation.
   Twenty seats in the congress have been reserved for members of
the academy. Sakharov originally was nominated in January, but the
academy's screening committee eliminated him and other reformers
when it cut the list of candidates on the final ballot from more
than 100 to 23.
   However, Sakharov's supporters, charged the nominees were
old-style academic bureaucrats and organized a campaign to reject
them. In the first election last month, only eight of the 23 were
approved.
   This time, 28 candidates were nominated for the 12 seats still
open, and Sakharov, Sagdeev, Shmelev and other reformers were
nominated once again.
   Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his rights
activities, was exiled to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980
for criticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. In 1986,
Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow.
   Sakharov has since resumed his scientific work and continues to
speak out on social issues. He supports Gorbachev's reforms but
criticizes what he sees as efforts to slow or reverse them.
   The Communist Party, trade unions and social and professional
groups such as the academy will elect 750 congressional members.
The 1,500 others are elected from geographical districts.
   In balloting for the geographical districts on March 26, voters
rejected dozens of top party and government officials, many of whom
were running unopposed.
   Repeat elections will be held May 14 for almost 200 seats that
remain unfilled.

   The South Yorkshire police chief on
Friday accepted responsibility for the crowd-control methods used
by officers in the soccer stadium disaster that killed 95 people.
   But Chief Constable Peter Wright also predicted a government
inquiry into the April 15 tragedy will clear the police.
   ``I welcome the inquiry which is about to take place and will
undoubtedly reveal the true nature and cause of this terrible
tragedy. I believe that when it is completed, the actions of the
South Yorkshire police will be seen in a very different light,''
Wright told a meeting of the local police authority in Sheffield.
   Police have been criticized for opening a locked gate during the
match at Hillsborough Stadium, which allowed as many as 3,000
late-arriving fans to surge into a crowded standing-room-only area
of the stadium.
   Many fans were crushed to death against barriers and perimeter
fencing just minutes into the English Football Association
semifinal match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
   ``Those officers were appointed by me to make those decisions
and it follows that I accept full responsibility for the police
action connected with the event'' Wright said.
   Wright said 1,111 officers were on duty, 257 inside the grounds
and 854 outside. He said the number of officers outside the opened
gate was the same as for previous semifinals at the stadium.
   The Home Office said Friday that 43 people were arrested at the
stadium the day of the disaster, more than half for drunkenness,
and 19 policemen were injured.
   Sir Peter Taylor, an appeals court justice leading the inquiry
into Britain's worst sports disaster, went to Liverpool to pay his
respects at Anfield stadium, home ground of the team whose fans
were killed. He said his inquiry will open April 28.
   ``This scene is a most poignant and moving one, which makes one
realize how deeply this community has been afflicted and how deeply
it feels its loss,'' Taylor said.``We are all conscious of that,
and we are all conscious of the need to ensure that it must never
happen again.''
   Taylor said he plans to attend a soccer match incognito and
watch from the standing-room area to ``see what actually happens
there.''
   Eighteen victims of the disaster were buried Friday In
Liverpool, 178 miles north of London.
   Two Liverpool players were among more than 700 mourners at
Aigburth Methodist Church in Liverpool for the funeral of Philip
Hammond, 13.
   Canon John Newton told them ``As we grieve, let us all resolve
that we will learn the bitter lessons of this tragedy, that we will
make the safety of spectators an absolute priority in professional
football ...''
   At St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, another Liverpool player
and coach attended the funeral of the oldest victim, 67-year-old
Gerard Baron. Baron had attended the match with his 28-year-old
son, who survived.
   A second hearse was needed to carry Baron's flowers, including
red and white carnations shaped into a soccer ball with the message
``You'll never walk alone,'' the Liverpool team's anthem.

<HEAD>Ideologist Warns Flood of Money Could Sink Perestroika</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet economic reform is in danger of drowning in
a flood of too much money in circulation, the Kremlin's chief
ideologist warned Friday.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, speaking at a meeting to celebrate the 119th
anniversary of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin's birth, said if
the country ``can't curb the stream of money that has overflowed,''
then the result could be ``the failure of economic reform.''
   Medvedev was referring to the fact that Soviet citizens have
lots of money but little to buy in the stores. As a result, new
shipments of consumer goods sell out quickly and many items are
hard to find.
   A senior government statistician revealed Friday the problem is
worsening.
   Average wages rose 9.5 percent in the first three months of
1989, compared with the same period a year earlier. But
productivity increased just 4.5 percent and consumer goods
production rose 5.8 percent, said Nikolai G. Belov, first deputy
chief of the state statistics board.
   Soviet statistics, unlike Western ones, do not account for
inflation.
   ``Wages have risen much faster than projected, much faster than
productivity of labor, which adversely affects the market
situation,'' Belov said.
   The average wage of Soviet workers jumped from $347 to $379 a
month in the first three months, Belov said.
   As a result of the deficit of goods, Soviets are saving massive
amounts of money. Belov said about $497 billion is being kept in
savings accounts and is out of circulation.
   Medvedev, the member of the ruling Politburo responsible for
ideology, culture and propaganda, said that ``without a hard,
stable ruble, the whole system of economic regulators cannot work.''
   The Soviet ruble-exchange rate is set by the government at $1.62
per ruble, but the black market rate is 12 cents to 25 cents per
ruble.
   Medvedev also said the move toward a more market-oriented
economy is proceeding slower than desired. Factories are supposed
to be developing their own suppliers and customers instead of
depending on centralized allocations.
   He also cited pricing and the government deficit as key
problems. Soviet prices are set by bureaucrats with no regard to
cost of production. The budget deficit is estimated at $160 billion
this year.
   The ideologist emphasized the justice of paying people according
to their ability and output. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
also said the old system of encouraging equality must end.
   ``Demagogic calls to equalize everything and everybody are alien
to socialism,'' Medvedev said.
   The 60-year-old ideologist spoke in the giant hall of the
Kremlin's Palace of Congresses before the Politburo and a capacity
audience of workers, military officers and other dignitaries.
   Medvedev has come out in favor of a moderate course for
perestroika, saying the party is steering a course between
extremists who want either no reform or too much, too fast.

<HEAD>Search for Duck-Eating `Monster' Ends</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The search for a mysterious ``monster from the
black lagoon'' that may be gobbling helpless baby ducklings in a
downtown nature pond ended Friday with the sighting of two well-fed
catfish swishing lazily through the shallows.
   The catfish were spotted by National Park Service ranger Helen
Horton, who was slogging through the muck wearing rubber hip waders
and armed with a long-handled rake and fish net after the pond,
normally about three feet deep, had been all but drained.
   ``The catfish are a strong possibility,'' pronounced her boss,
biological engineer John Hoke. ``They just love ducks. Yes, the
catfish are an awfully good smoking gun.''
   Hoke said he would refill the pond outside the main entrance to
Interior Department headquarters and set an underwater trap for the
catfish as soon as possible. Meantime, the remaining three
ducklings will have to take their chances on survival.
   The ducklings' plight has aroused the sympathy and worried
concern of scores of federal office workers who stroll past Bolivar
Pond or pause for a midday picnic in the small, surrounding park
that also features an equestrian statue of South American liberator
Simon Bolivar.
   A female mallard duck that had taken up residence in the pond
with several male companions gave birth to 11 ducklings last week.
On Monday, nine of the fluffy, yellow-faced babies remained. The
next day, there were seven.
   Kathie O'Toole, an Interior Department budget analyst, became
alarmed and telephoned the Park Service. She feared the ducklings
were victims of a snapping turtle. Workmen began slowly draining
the pond on Thursday to try to find what a Park Service spokesman
jokingly called ``the monster from the black lagoon.''
   By Friday morning, only three ducklings were left, darting here
and there under the protective gaze of their mother.
   ``Jeez, it's devastating,'' said Cindy Archer, a graphic artist
from nearby American Red Cross headquarters who has visited the
pond frequently this week.
   Other passersby, including bemedaled Daughters of the American
Revolution conventioneers, peered anxiously down at the remaining
ducklings. Some tossed them bread crumbs or popcorn.
   ``I can see it _ the Loch Ness monster comes up at night and ...
glump!'' said one woman. ``Maybe there's an alligator in there,''
said another.
   Ms. Horton's rake failed to uncover any snapping turtles under
the large, partially submerged log or the planters containing
irises, cattails and spiky water cannon, or hiding on a little
island in the shadow of a bald cypress.
   Other early suspects were racoons or rats known to inhabit
neighboring shrubbery or burrows. Both animals are meat eaters who
can swim underwater. But Hoke eliminated them because no trace of
the missing ducklings, such as feathers or scraps of meat or bone,
has ever been found.
   ``Racoons are very fastidious, even washing their hands after a
meal, but I can't believe they would eat feathers,'' he said.
``These ducklings simply disappear. It's either a gulper or people
or something that would remove them entirely.''
   Hoke said the catfish probably were dumped into the pond by what
he derisively calls ``midnight environmentalists,''
well-intentioned nature lovers who introduce hazardous creatures
into a carefully balanced natural habitat in an urban setting.
   Wildlife experts were much more sanguine about the ducklings'
disappearance than the passersby who crowded around the pond this
week.
   ``The loss of ducklings is always unfortunate but it is not
abnormal to lose 50 percent of a brood in the wild,'' said Mike
Smith, a spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
``Freshly hatched ducklings are extremely vulnerable and very easy
targets for predators.''
   Said Ms. Horton:
   ``Animals have more offspring than can possibly survive, and
once they die they provide a valuable source of food for other
animals. It's all part of the natural order of things.
   ``It happens all the time in the wilderness, but it's hard for
people right here in the city to watch nature doing its thing.''

<HEAD>Book Says Onassis Plotted Nude Photos of Jackie</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Aristotle Onassis plotted with photographers to
publish candid, nude photographs of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis so
she would stop complaining about tamer shots taken by papparazzi,
according to a new book.
   ``He figured if she appeared in the nude, nothing else they did
could ever offend her again,'' the late lawyer Roy Cohn is quoted
as saying in ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' an upcoming unauthorized
biography of the former first lady written by C. David Heymann. It
is being serialized in the weekly Star, a supermarket tabloid.
   The photographs of Mrs. Onassis sunbathing on Skorpios, the
Greek island where she married Onassis in 1968, were taken by 10
photographers using telephoto lenses and underwater cameras and
appeared in magazines around the world.
   Nancy Tuckerman, spokeswoman for Mrs. Onassis, said when the
first part of the series appeared last week that the former first
lady would have no comment.
   The book also detailed Mrs. Onassis' lavish spending sprees and
said that the question of money came up at the funeral of Onassis,
who died on March 15, 1975, the Star reports in its Monday edition.
   Mrs. Onassis' brother-in-law, Sen. Edward Kennedy, who earlier
had negotiated her prenuptial contract with Onassis, rode in the
funeral limousine with her and Christina Onassis, Aristotle's
daughter.
   Christina Onassis, who has since died, told Heymann in a brief
interview that Kennedy turned to her in the limousine and said,
``Now, it's time to take care of Jackie.''
   ``It seemed almost inconceivable that Ted Kennedy would choose
that moment to discuss financial matters,'' said Christina Onassis.
``But it was Jackie's hyena-like smile that drove me from the car.
She was like a hungry vulture waiting to feast on my father's
flesh.''
   Book sales begin May 2. The New York Daily News, Cosmopolitan,
New Woman and McCall's have second serialization rights.

<HEAD>Ideology Chief Says Ethnic Strife Can Kill Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Kremlin's ideology chief said Friday that
ethnic strife can kill President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
restructuring effort, and he pledged that republics will gain more
autonomy under reforms expected this year.
   Vadim A. Medvedev spoke at a meeting dedicated to the birthday
of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin as the country struggles with
the aftermath of a clash between protesters and soldiers that
killed 20 people in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.
   A member of the Soviet Union's new parliament charged in
separate remarks that officials in Moscow knew in advance that the
military would charge protesters in the April 9 independence
demonstration.
   Medvedev said: ``The party is convinced the solution of the
complicated problems of national relations is impossible outside
perestroika.'' He said perestroika, or restructuring, ``cannot be
implemented without the cooperation, mutual action and unity of
Soviet peoples.''
   ``It is important that one nation not be set against another,''
he said in his nationally televised speech. ``We firmly say `yes'
to national sentiments and national pride, `no' to national
exclusivity and antagonism.''
   Soviet officials have promised that the policy-making Communist
Party Central Committee will meet this year to take up ethnic
issues that have caused tensions in the Caucasus republics, the
Baltics and elsewhere.
   That meeting had been scheduled for summer, but Medvedev
indicated the problems might be discussed at a meeting next week.
   Other top officials have confirmed that the Central Committee
will meet Tuesday, and Medvedev told the gathering that the issue
will come up at the next Central Committee meeting.
   The ruling Politburo, at a meeting Thursday, told the Georgian
Communist Party Central Committee to investigate the April 9 clash
and take measures to improve party work and ``consolidate social
forces on the platform of perestroika,'' the official Tass news
agency reported Friday.
   Medvedev said: ``Great attention will be paid to the creation of
real conditions for the full-blood economic, governmental-legal,
and cultural functioning of the republics, to the strengthening of
the status of autonomy, to the carrying out of the rights of
national minorities including the formation of national regions,
rural and village councils, and the securing of rights and freedoms
for Soviet citizens of all nationalities.''
   At a meeting earlier Friday, a newly elected member of the
Congress of People's Deputies charged that Moscow officials knew in
advance of the military's violent dispersal of protesters in
Tbilisi April 9.
   Eldar Shengelaya told a meeting at the Soviet Union of
Filmmakers that members of the Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee ``couldn't have not known about it.''
   Shengelaya, a Georgian, was one of six new deputies who wrote a
critical report on the authorities' actions in Tbilisi that was
published in the latest weekly edition of Moscow News.
   He spoke after officials of the Filmmakers Union showed film of
the clash, including bodies of the dead and interviews with
survivors.
   Some of the several hundred viewers wiped tears from their eyes
when the film showed the body of a middle-aged woman in a green
sweater lying on a morgue table, her face badly beaten.
   Bodies of several young women were shown lying together on the
floor of the morgue. Doctors lifted bandages off the face of a
young man who they said was shot in the head by soldiers and lost
his eyesight.
   The film showed soldiers and armored personnel carriers moving
down the street toward the crowd and protesters fearfully running
from the clash. The head of the Georgian church, Ilya II, warned
the protesters before the clash that ``great danger is ahead of
you.''
   A commission is investigating charges that the soldiers used
shovels, truncheons, tear gas and a still-unidentified chemical
substance on the demonstrators.
   Activists have said that several people died from chemical
poisoning, but Moscow officials have not confirmed that.
   A member of the Georgian Health Ministry commission that has
been examining victims of the clash said in an interview on
national television Friday that the panel believes unanimously that
two poisonous chemical substances were used. The woman was not
identified.
   Another member of the commission interviewed on the nightly news
program Vremya said the poisonous substance ``is no secret, it is
used in almost all the countries in the world, it's tear gas.''
   But the man, who was not identified, said some of the patients
have symptoms that are not typically created by irritants like tear
gas.
   Vremya said 92 patients are hospitalized in Tbilisi, and more
come in every day with poisoning symptoms.
   Georgian officials said they never expected bloodshed when they
sent the soldiers into the crowd. The republic's Communist Party
chief and premier accepted responsibility and resigned.
   Protests in Georgia started April 4 against demands by the small
Abkhazian minority to be separated from Georgia. But demands for
full Georgian independence from the Soviet Union became more
frequent as protests continued.

   Oliver North's jury debated his guilt or
innocence in a tightly guarded room Friday, as an alternate juror
who heard all the testimony said she would have voted to convict
him on some of the 12 charges.
   The jurors deliberated for about six hours before quitting for
the day. They will resume Saturday morning.
   ``Mr. North ... wasn't made to do what he did,'' said Horasina
McKie, one of five alternates dismissed when the case went to the
jury. ``He had a choice in it. He had a choice to either say `No, I
don't want to do this' or `Yes sir, I will do this' even as it went
along and he knew it was wrong.''
   North is charged with withholding information from Congress,
lying to Attorney General Edwin Meese III about his activities in
the Iran-Contra affair, destroying and altering documents, misusing
money entrusted to him and accepting an illegal gratuity _ a
$13,800 security system at his home.
   Ms. McKie said she had not discussed the case with other jurors
_ following the strict instructions given daily by U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell _ and did not know how they feel.
   If that held true for the entire jury, the nine women and three
men judging North discussed the former National Security Council
aide for the first time starting at 9:40 a.m.
   They could not help but notice on their arrival _ and on their
departure _ that the courthouse, between the Capitol and the White
House, had become a news media center. Huge television trucks were
parked on the street, wires snaked around the building and cameras
were aimed at every entrance.
   The jurors quickly had requests, relayed to the judge on notes.
They asked for copies of Gesell's instructions, which took more
than two hours to read in court; for note pads, paper clips and
pencils.
   Jury members will deliberate a half day on Saturday, but not on
Sunday. Their lunches in the courthouse are being catered.
   After a night sequestered in a downtown hotel, the jurors were
brought to the federal courthouse in a van and taken to an 18-by-12
room only a few feet away from the courtroom where they had
listened to testimony for eight weeks. Their room was further
crowded with hundreds of exhibits, some still classified as top
secret. A U.S. marshal guarded the door..
   The foreman is a 34-year-old hospital clerk, Denise Anderson,
who said during pre-trial questioning that she does not like news
and that the extensive television coverage given North's testimony
during the 1987 congressional hearings ``made me mad. ... I did not
look at it at all.''
   Ms. McKie, the alternate juror who commented in an interview
with CBS News, touched on one of North's major defenses, that he
was authorized to do all he did.
   ``No one said, `If you don't do this we're going to fire you,'''
the alternate juror said. In his instructions, Gesell had told the
jury to remember that no one, including the president, had the
right to order an unlawful act.
   ``I believe Mr. Reagan knew what was going on,'' Ms. McKie said.
``I can't say he knew everything, but I think he knew enough to
know what was going on. I mean, you see (National Security Adviser
Robert) McFarlane every week, he's only 100 yards from you or feet
from you.''
   Reagan told the investigative Tower commission two years ago
that he did not know the National Security Council staff was
engaged in helping the Contra rebels in Nicaragua when official
U.S. aid was banned.
   North testified he was acting under orders, even when he lied to
a congressional committee in denying he was assisting the Contras.
He said that he had no idea any of his actions violated the law and
that he had good motives for what he did.
   If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 60 years in
prison and fined as much as $3 million. However, federal court
practice is generally to limit sentences to the longest term for
any one count _ in this case 10 years.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Communist States Violating Press Freedom Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States accused hard-line Communist
states on Friday of repeatedly violating an East-West accord on
free speech. As one example, it cited the imprisonment of
Czechoslovak playwright Vaclav Havel.
   Dusan Spacil, the chief Czechoslovak delegate at a 35-nation
conference to monitor the ageement, retorted that the United States
had no right to tell East bloc countries how to comply.
   ``What gives Marks (Ambassador Leonard H. Marks, the U.S.
delegation chief) the authority to say who are the good guys and
who are the bad guys?'' asked Spacil. ``I don't think we need it.''
   Spacil attacked the U.S. delegation at the end of opening
addresses in which Western countries, headed by the United States
and Canada, singled out Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and East
Germany as the accord's worst offenders.
   Western countries have contrasted the records of the four states
with moves in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary toward greater
press and other freedoms.
   The conference began Tuesday and is to last a month. It is a
follow-up to the accord signed by the 35 nations last January at
the end of the Conference on European Security and Cooperation in
Vienna. Negotiations on the accord began in Helsinki in the 1970s.
   Marks, a former director of the U.S. Information Agency, said
Havel was jailed partly on allegations that he ``sought to incite
disturbances through foreign radio broadcasts.''
   ``Is that in the spirit of Helsinki?'' said Marks.
   Marks added in his opening address to the conference that in
Romania ``foreign journalists have been ill-treated and three
Romanian journalists remain under arrest for allegedly producing a
leaflet critical of the government.''
   He accused Bulgarian authorities of suppressing the Soviet
policy of glasnost, or greater openness, and said the East German
government continued strict press censorship.
   Marks was the last speaker in four days of public sessions that
have been marked by a conciliatory attitude on the part of the
Soviet delegation while Western delegates turned on the four least
reformist of the Kremlin's allies.
   Soviet officials complained, however, that London-based Soviet
journalists have been prevented from covering a series of British
disasters because they need British government permission to travel
more than 25 miles outside London.
   Similar restrictions apply to Western journalists in the Soviet
Union.
   Recent disasters in Britain included such major international
stories as the Pan Am bombing over Scotland in December, which
killed 270 people, and a crush at a soccer match in Sheffield,
northern England a week ago, in which 95 spectators died.

<HEAD>Activists Take Over City Council Chambers In Budget Protest</HEAD>

   Hundreds of activists upset with proposed
cuts in social services spending disrupted a city budget hearing
Friday, and 12 protesters singing ``We Shall Not Be Moved'' were
taken into custody.
   Police led the protesters from City Council chambers after
Deputy Police Commissioner Thomas McGeehan asked them to move from
council members' chairs so the hearing could resume.
   Robert Brand, a research director for the hospital workers'
union, was the first person taken out of the chambers. He said he
joined the protest ``to guarantee that the city passes a budget
that doesn't kill people.''
   City Solicitor Seymour Kurland said he was not sure whether
those detained would be charged.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode last month proposed a $2 billion budget
that would cut spending for the homeless, AIDS and community
organizations but bolster police and health clinic staffs.
   Goode was not at the hearing. His spokeswoman, Karen Warrington,
had no immediate comment.
   The protest was organized by a coalition of labor and community
groups. Four hundred people had packed the ornate chamber gallery,
bearing signs saying ``AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power,'' ``Save
City Health Services'' and ``Be Fair to Those Who Care.''
   Testimony by city finance officials had barely begun when
protesters began climbing over railings and seizing microphones on
members' desks to make speeches or shout slogans.
   A dozen police buses and paddy wagons raced to City Hall and
officers quickly lined the chamber as the protesters shouted: ``You
say `Cut back.' We said `Fight back.'''
   Council President Joseph C. Coleman tried to gavel the
protesters into silence a number of times, but gave up shortly
before 11:30 a.m. and called a recess until afternoon.
   Most of the protesters then left, but about 40 stayed.
   When city officials tried to reconvene the hearing, the 12
protesters who refused to go to the part of the room set aside for
the public were detained.
   The hearing then proceeded quietly with a limited number of
people allowed to sit in the spectators' gallery. Many held protest
signs in silence.
   Protesters will attend every council meeting and budget hearing
until the budget is approved, said Joe Rogers, an activist with
Project Share, an advocacy group for the homeless and mentally ill.
   ``We'll be demanding that they develop a human budget, a humane
budget, that doesn't cut back at the cost of the poor,'' said
Rogers, who also was detained.
   City Councilman Angel Ortiz, a Democrat who has opposed the
cuts, said he felt the protest effectively showed the budget ``is a
very mean budget.''
   ``We cannot be cutting recreation, health, AIDS, homeless and so
on and expect to have a safe city,'' he said.
   City Councilman Jack Kelly, a Republican, said the demonstration
would have no effect on his support for less social spending.
   ``This city took it on itself to fund these programs,'' he said,
``and it's just escalated to the point where it's too expensive for
the people of Philadelphia to shoulder it.''

   Omega, a bald eagle that helped educate
thousands of people about the endangered species, has died at the
Dickerson Park Zoo.
   The female eagle, estimated to be about 20, suffered from an
undetermined ailment and was put to sleep Wednesday, zoo director
Mike Crocker said Friday.
   The eagle became ill in February and its condition worsened
despite treatment with drugs. Omega eventually became unable to
stand and would not eat, Crocker said.
   ``Our feeling, and the feeling of the veterinarian, was she was
suffering and there was nothing we could do for her,'' he said.
   A necropsy showed an enlarged liver, but ``we're not real
optimistic that the cause of death will be known,'' he said.
   The bird may have died from long-term effects of lead poisoning,
Crocker said. Omega was found wounded in northern Missouri in 1971
and took up residence at the Springfield zoo in 1975.
   She was the star of the Missouri Department of Conservation
Department's Eagle Days, a program designed to educate residents
about the endangered birds. ``About 10,000 people saw her in the
past year alone at Eagle Days,'' Crocker said.
   Eagles have been known to live into their 30s, Crocker said.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday upheld a
Federal Communications Commission policy giving preference to women
and minorities trying to gain broadcasting licenses.
   The decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia followed a March 31 ruling by another
panel of judges at the court that found a companion FCC minority
preference policy was unconstitutional.
   The case acted on Friday was brought by Metro Broadcasting and
Winter Park Communications over the awarding of a television
license to Rainbow Broadcasting in the Orlando, Fla., area.
   Rainbow was granted the license when its high percentage of
minority ownership outweighed factors favoring Metro, particularly
how well the Metro owners were integrated into the station's
management.
   Writing for the panel, Judge Harry T. Edwards said the case
closely paralleled a 1984 case involving West Michigan Broadcasting
Co., in which ``this court expressly held that the FCC's use of an
enhancement for minority status `easily passes constitutional
muster.'''
   FCC spokeswoman Maureen Peratino said commission chairman Dennis
Patrick would have no comment on the decision.
   Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access
Project, hailed the ruling.
   ``This is a sound policy promoting core democratic values and a
sound decision upholding it,'' Schwartzman said.
   The Justice Department had intervened on behalf of the
plaintiffs.
   The case began in 1983, when an administrative law judge first
awarded the license to Metro after disqualifing Rainbow for ``lack
of candor'' in its application.
   Rainbow and Winter Park appealed to an FCC review board, which
reversed the judge on the candor issue and awarded the license to
Rainbow. The judge said Rainbow had 90 percent Hispanic ownership
participation, whereas Metro had only one 19.8 percent partner, who
was black.
   The board said the minority and ``slight female ownership
advantage'' outweighed factors in Metro's favor.
   After Metro and Winter Park appealed to the court, the FCC in
1986 began reviewing its comparative preference policies. It found
that absent Rainbow's minority advantages, Rainbow would not have
gotten the license over Metro.
   On Dec. 22, 1987, then-President Reagan signed an appropriations
measure in which Congress forbade the FCC from spending any money
to continue the re-examination of or change its minority policies.
   Winter Park argued it should have been given the license in
order to establish the first TV station in the community of Winter
Park, where it also would have served Orlando along with five other
stations there. The court rejected Winter Park's argument and
assessed the minority preference issues.
   Edwards and Judge Daniel M. Friedman concurred in the ruling,
while Judge Stephen F. Williams agreed in part and dissented in
part.
   In his dissent, Williams said the West Michigan decision ``to
make race pivotal'' in license allocations had been ``undermined''
by more recent Supreme Court decisions on minority set-aside
programs.
   The appeals court, in its March 31 ruling, had thrown out the
FCC's so-called distress sale policy, which allowed broadcasters in
jeopardy of losing their licenses to quickly sell to a minority
enterprise at 75 percent of the station's fair market value.

<TEXT>
   Syrian gunners fired rocket barrages at
the coast north of Beirut on Friday, trying to stop boats from
rescuing Christians fleeing their shell-shattered enclave.
   One Cypriot-flagged ferry defied the bombardment, picked up
hundreds of war-weary refugees and departed for the open sea.
   Police said the Syrians withheld fire when the ferry Baroness M
dropped anchor off Jounieh Port, 12 miles north of Beirut, and did
not enter the harbor.
   A police spokesman said four large speedboats shuttled about
1,200 Lebanese to the vessel and it began its nine-hour voyage back
to Larnaca, Cyprus, around 4:30 p.m., an hour after arrival.
   He said least 4,000 refugees remained in Jounieh waiting for the
next boat.
   The Baroness M is one of two ferries operated from Cyprus that
have ferried more than 12,000 refugees from the beleaguered
310-square-mile Christian enclave in the past six weeks.
   The other ferry, the Larnaca Rose, suspended the service two
days ago after it escaped a Syrian barrage while anchored off
Jounieh.
   It was not known why the Syrians and their Druse militia allies
allowed the evcuation to go smoothly despite the day-long
bombardment along the coast between Jounieh and Christian east
Beirut.
   Outgoing rockets shook Moslem west Beirut as the Syrians fired
from truck-mounted BM-21 launchers that spit out 40 122mm
projectiles in 20 seconds. The rockets damaged roads, buildings and
shopsbut no casualties were reported.
   Christian army units under Gen. Michel Aoun did not return fire,
said the police spokesman, who spoke anonymously according to
regulations.
   An unofficial cease-fire Wednesday had halted rocket and
artillery duels that had raged for 42 days between Aoun's
20,000-member army and his Syrian and Druse foes. There was no
explanation for the sudden halt in the bloodshed, which has killed
270 people and wounded 975 since March 8.
   The Syrians' new bombardment along the coast Friday sent
Beirutis dashing back to underground shelters.
   Kuwait's Al-Qabas newspaper said several Arab states were
seeking to convince Syria to accept the deployment of an Arab
peacekeeping force before the Arab League foreign ministers meet in
an emergency session on Lebanon next week.
   It said the force could number ``several hundred officers and
troops from six or seven Arab states,'' but did not name the
countries.
   Wafa Tabbara, a Moslem housewife, led her three children to the
shelter in night clothes. She vowed to leave Beirut.
   ``I'm going to stay with friends in south Lebanon. There are no
hotels in the south to accomodate us any more. I have no option but
to accept the embarrassment of staying with friends,'' she said.
   ``I won't stay here and wait for a shell to come and kill me
with my children.''
   Cars loaded with bags, mattresses and blankets were seen heading
out of the Moslem sector Friday.
   Others resigned themselves to staying.
   ``We have no option but to fortify the entrance to our building
with sandbags against shelling. They'll shell again and we'll use
the entrance as a shelter,'' said Talal Qabbani, 60, a bank
employee and Sunni Moslem.
   ``I am prepared to live in an underground shelter for the rest
of my life, but I won't leave my shop or apartment to be looted,''
Izzat Salam, a parts dealer, said. His family has fled to Syria.
   The police spokesman said the department has received many
complaints recently about robberies of bomb-damaged apartments,
shops and warehouses.
   About 1,500 Christians demonstrated outside the U.S. Embassy in
support of Aoun's war against Syria, which maintains 40,000 troops
in Lebanon under an Arab League mandate to halt the 14-year-old
civil war.
   The demonstrators burned a Syrian flag, chanted slogans
denouncing Syrian President Hafez Assad and urged President Bush to
take action.

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department has hired Linda Stuntz,
a Washington lawyer and former congressional aide, to direct the
formation of a new national energy policy, a department source said
Friday.
   Mrs. Stuntz, reached by telephone at her law office, said it
would be ``inappropriate'' for her to discuss the matter.
   ``I really can't talk about it,'' she said. She did not deny she
had taken the job.
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, disclosed earlier
this week that he had persuaded a woman, whom he declined to
identify by name, to take the policy planning job. He said she
twice turned him down before finally accepting.
   Moore said she would start May 1. Ms. Stuntz was identified by
the source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   At his swearing-in ceremony on Thursday, Moore it was a top
priority of the department to ``fashion the first real national
energy policy this country has ever had.''
   Stuntz served as minority staff director of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee before joining the Washington office of the law
firm Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue.
   In a separate development, the department announced that Energy
Secretary James E. Watkins would travel to the Savannah River Site
nuclear weapons complex, near Aiken, S.C., next Friday to tour the
facilities and talk with employees.
   It will be Watkins' first visit to one of the department's 16
major weapons plants, spread across 12 states, since he took office
last month. Modernizing the cleaning up hazardous wastes at the
sites is one of Watkins' chief aims.
   The South Carolina site includes three disabled nuclear reactors
that are the nation's only source of tritium, a radioactive gas
needed in the manufacture of nuclear warheads. The department is
expected to decide later this spring or summer on a timetable for
restarting the reactors, which were closed down last spring for
safety reasons.
   The department said Watkins would be accompanied by Paul Lego,
president of Westinghouse Electric Corp., which earlier this month
took over as manager of the facility, and by chairmen of the House
and Senate armed services committees.

   The top members of the Senate Armed Services

explosion aboard the USS Iowa that claimed 47 lives.
   Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman, and the ranking Republican,

Navy's board of inquiry completes its probe into the accident.
   The hearings will focus on safety procedures used in the past,
whether changes in the procedures are necessary and possible
conditions imposed on the continued use of the 16-inch weapons
found on the Iowa battleship, the senators said in a joint
statement.
   The Navy on Thursday imposed a moratorium on firing of the
16-inch weapons pending an investigation.
   Nunn and Warner also expressed their deep sorrow over the loss
of life aboard the Iowa, saying, ``It reminds us that every day,
even in peacetime, our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are
serving their country `in harm's way.'''

   Workers and campus police tore up a
concrete slab and carted away building materials at People's Park
early Friday, thwarting activists' attempts to build a permanent
toilet.
   The ``restroom brigade,'' as they called themselves, dug a
trench and poured concrete Thursday following a rally and march
commemorating the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the
``park,'' which is on land owned by the University of California at
Berkeley.
   Some of the builders camped overnight to guard materials, but
moved aside and did not confront police. The group was back working
at the site after the university crew left, vowing they would not
give up. University police watched from a short distance away.
   In 1969, activists occupied an empty lot owned by the
university. One man was killed and hundreds wounded in riots that
erupted when the university fenced in the lot and tore up greenery
planted by activists.
   Protesters tore down the fence in 1972 and the university has
allowed the public limited use of the land. But university
spokesman Ray Colvig said the university's rules include a ban on
permanent structures.

   A Phoenix high school senior crowned in the

official said.
   Leeann Elston of Tuscon actually won the competition, but
``clerical error and confusion'' at the pageant's conclusion
resulted in first runner-up Shannon Marketic being crowned, Donna
Kinney, the pageant's executive director, said Thursday.
   Ms. Kinney said the mistake was found in a review of three
videotapes of the pageant and an audit of the judges' notarized
ballots.
   Pageant officials discovered the error after the pageant but
waited until Monday to inform Miss Marketic because they wanted to
determine what went wrong, Ms. Kinney said.
   When they told her, the teen-ager ``took a deep breath'' but
``didn't say much,'' Ms. Kinney said.
   Miss Marketic's father, Dennis, said Wednesday he had not seen
or heard evidence that convinced him his daughter did not win but
said he would talk to pageant officials before taking any action.
   ``All we know is that Shannon was crowned,'' he said.

   Authorities blamed communist rebels
for Friday's ambush-slaying of an American colonel, and the U.S.
ambassador said the killing will only strengthen U.S. support for
President Corazon Aquino.
   Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe was dead on arrival at a suburban
Philippine military hospital moments after at least two gunmen in a
stolen car sprayed his vehicle with gunfire as he headed for work,
officials said.
   Rowe, 51, a native of McAllen, Texas, was a decorated Vietnam
War hero who was held in a cage for five years by the Viet Cong as
a prisoner of war until he escaped in 1968.
   Rowe was chief of the army division at the Joint U.S. Military
Advisory Group headquarters in the Manila suburb of Quezon City.
The unit provides training and logistical support to the Philippine
military, which is fighting a 20-year communist insurgency.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but Defense
Secretary Fidel Ramos said Filipino officials believe the killers
were communist rebels. He noted the rebels had threatened to attack
U.S. targets unless the United States closed its bases here and
stopped aiding Mrs. Aquino's government.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said in a statement he was
uncertain about the rebels' involvement.
   ``But should anyone think that killing this brave officer will
alter in any way U.S. policy of support for Philippine democracy,
they are wrong,'' he said. ``...This act will only strengthen
American resolve to stand with the government and people of the
Philippines led by President Aquino. We will not be deterred by
terrorists.''
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the
killing ``a cowardly and heinous act.
   ``Col. Rowe was in the Philippines to help the Filipino people
in their efforts to defend democracy,'' Fitzwater said. ``We will
work closely with the Philippine government in their efforts to
track down and bring to justice those responsible for this
assassination.''
   Rowe's body, accompanied by his wife, Suzanne, and two children,
was flown by helicopter from the hospital to Clark Air Base, 50
miles north of Manila. Funeral plans were incomplete.
   Rowe's Filipino driver was wounded in the 7 a.m. attack three
blocks from Rowe's office.
   Police said up to three cars may have been used in the ambush,
but witnesses said they saw only one with at least three men, a
driver and two gunmen. One gunman had an M-16 rifle and the other a
.45-caliber pistol, they said.
   The attack came five days after the communist National
Democratic Front warned the rebels were ``determined to make U.S.
imperialism pay dearly for the continuing stay of its bases and its
escalating intervention in our people's affairs.''
   The statement was issued to claim reponsibility for the bombing
of a U.S. communications station in the northern province of
Benguet. No one was hurt in the April 9 bombing.
   In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino
outside Clark. The killings caused authorities to increase security
at six U.S. military installations and civilian offices here.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said future
attacks probably would be against officers assigned to the advisory
group for which Rowe worked. Soldiers were warned to vary their
routes to and from work and to tint their car windows to avoid
detection.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher was asked by
reporters in Washington about the safety of Americans in the
Philippines. He noted a U.S. travel advisory issued March 15
``indicates areas of the country where, because of criminal
activity or terrorist activity, people should try to avoid.'' The
advisory states most urban areas in the Philippines including
Manila are safe for travelers.
   Boucher then was asked if that advisory might be revised. ``I'm
sure that will be looked at,'' he said. ``I would note that the
threats that I have heard about were against official Americans,
and weren't general threats to travelers.''
   Rowe was imprisoned in the jungles of Vietnam by the Viet Cong
from October 1963 until he escaped on New Year's Eve 1968. He later
wrote a book about the ordeal titled ``Five Years To Freedom.''
   After returning to the United States, he was made chief of the
Army's Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape Training unit at
Fort Bragg, N.C., which included anti-terrorism techniques. He
later served as commander of the 1st Special Warfare Training
Battalion at Fort Bragg.
   Rowe's decorations included the Silver Star, Legion of Merit,
two Bronze Stars, two Purple Hearts, the Meritorious Service Medal,
a National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, an
Army Service Ribbon and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross
Unit Citation.

   More than 900 Roman Catholics have
petitioned the Providence Diocese to protest its order that they
remove elaborate decorations from their loved ones' graves, the
group's leader said Friday.
   ``It was traumatic experience losing an 11-year-old son,'' said
one of the protesters, Robert Kelley. ``You find a decoration you
like and they tell you you can't use it.''
   He and others said the silk and plastic wreaths, which encircle
the headstones in a vine-like fashion, are better than potted or
stem flowers, which are often stolen or tipped over at St. Ann
Cemetery.
   Kelley, joined by a few friends and relatives, took a baseball
bat to the cemetery Friday, saying he was ``prepared to go to
jail'' to preserve the decorations.
   The church established new guidelines governing grave
decorations in January, replacing ones that were at least 30 years
old. The move followed complaints that the decorations were
inappropriate, diocesan officials said.
   Monsignor Salvatore Matano, co-chancellor of the diocese, said
although the church does not allow decorations attached to
monuments, it will continue to allow vases of flowers, as a ``happy
medium that allows for dignity and decorum.''
   ``Our cemeteries must reflect a Christian attitude toward
death,'' Matano said. ``The emphasis really should not be placed so
much upon a place of burial.''
   The dispute has inflamed the emotions of many with relatives
buried in the state's nine Catholic cemeteries. Rhode Island is
about 63 percent Catholic, considered by diocese the highest rate
in the nation.
   A petition signed by 915 people, calling themselves Catholics
For Fair Play, was sent to Bishop Louis E. Gelineau asking him to
rescind the new rules, said Albert Loffredo Jr., who heads the
protest. He also runs Monumental Decor Co., which provides and
maintains the vines to customers for $85 for a four-year contract
plus $28 annual upkeep fee.
   Loffredo and his 38 clients received a letter from a diocesan
attorney last week, informing them they had seven days to remove
the decorations, which had ``provoked complaints from persons who
own the right of interment at other burial sites.''
   ``I got a call telling me the (decorations) wouldn't be there
after Friday,'' said Gabriel Petrucci, whose parents and wife are
buried at the St. Ann. He said he was told ``if you're not
satisified, you can dig your loved one up and move.''
   The protesters said the decorations had not been removed by
Friday afternoon. Church officials did not return calls.
   The diocese has said it decided to clarify and enforce its
policy last Christmas, when Loffredo's elaborate decorations at his
grandparents' grave prompted others to match them.

   Do they ever love Lucy.
   Flowers, phone calls and faxes flooded Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center on Friday, as they have since Lucille Ball received a
transplanted piece of critical heart artery during emergency
surgery Tuesday night.
   The 77-year-old zany redhead, whose reign as queen of American

   ``She's going to be uncomfortable for a few days, but she's

   Meanwhile, the Cedars-Sinai facsimile machine was churning out
messages virtually nonstop for the Emmy Award-winning actress,
according to Wise, who said he delivered hundreds to Miss Ball's

   ``I am completely convinced the fax machine is destined to
become the Hallmark card of the '90s,'' Wise said.

<HEAD>Donovan Wants Government to Pay Legal Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan is
asking the federal government to pay $112,281 in legal bills he
says he incurred during an investigation of an alleged kickback
supposedly paid Donovan in 1977.
   Donovan and his lawyers say the legal fees and expenses are for
the period March 1987 through October 1987 in connection with the
probe by independent counsel Leon Silverman.
   The information was released Friday by a special three-member
panel of appeals court judges which appointed Silverman.
   Federal law on independent counsels provides for the government
to pay legal fees if the subject of the criminal investigation
isn't indicted.
   William Bittman, another partner, seven associates and three
paralegals of the law firm Pierson, Ball and Dowd provided legal
services and incurred expenses totaling $79,228 said the
application. Paul Curran, four associates and one paralegal of the
firm Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays and Handler are seeking $33,052
in fees and expenses.
   Donovan was cleared in the probe of accusations that he may have
lied when he denied knowing anything about the alleged kickback
scheme which involved a former supplier of Schiavone Construction
Co. where Donovan was working at the time.
   Silverman concluded that although there was ``some evidence to
support an indictment,'' a conviction is ``unlikely'' and charges
``not warranted.''
   One witness in the probe was elderly, ailing and had a failing
memory, said Silverman, while another was a convicted felon
awaiting sentencing who had given inconsistent statements.

<HEAD>Soviet Magazine To Publish Parts Of `The Gulag Archipelago'</HEAD>

   A Soviet literary journal will publish selections
from ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' Alexander Solzhenitsyn's banned
book on Stalin's labor camps, a secretary at the magazine said
Friday.
   Some chapters from the long work will appear this year in the
monthly magazine Novy Mir, Valentina Ivanovna said in a telephone
interview.
   She refused to say who in the Soviet leadership had approved
publication of the gripping tale of repression under Stalin.
   In November, Communist Party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev
told a news conference that said exposing Soviets to such books
would undermine society.
   ``I am against the publication of a number works by
Solzhenitsyn, and in the first place such works as `Lenin in
Zurich' and `The Gulag Archipelago,''' he said.
   But The Washington Post on Friday quoted Novy Mir's chief
editor, Sergei P. Zalygin, as saying in an interview that President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev supported publication of Solzhenitsyn's works.
Ms. Ivanovna said Zalygin was unreachable.
   Novy Mir published Solzhenitsyn's short novel, ``One Day in the
Life of Ivan Denisovich'' in November 1962.
   The Gulag is a triology that maintains widescale political
repression began in the Soviet Union under founder Vladimir I.
Lenin.
   Zalygin said last year he was negotiating for the rights to
print Solzhenitsyn's novel ``Cancer Ward.'' Ms. Ivanovna said no
decision had been made about publishing works of Solzhenitsyn other
than the Gulag.
   Several writers, artists and activists have clamored for
publication of Solzhenitsyn's works, citing Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, which among other things allows re-examination of sore
points in Soviet history like Stalin's reign of terror.
   In February, a journal of the Soviet Peace Committee titled
Twentieth Century and Peace carried a commentary crediting
Solzhenitsyn for helping pave the way for Gorbachev's reforms.
   The reforms have led to publication of Soviet authors that had
been long banned. Others that have come into the open include the
novel ``Doctor Zhivago'' by Boris Pasternak and the political
satire ``Heart of a Dog'' by Mikhail Bulgakov.
   Solzhenitsyn was arrested, branded a traitor and expelled for
his writings.
   Solzhenitsyn, 70, gained U.S. citizenship in 1974. A Nobel
laureate, he is living in rural isolation in Vermont.

<TEXT>
   West Germany will press the United
States to agree to early superpower talks on the reduction of
short-range nuclear missiles, officials said Friday.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg will urge Washington to end its opposition to
early talks with the Soviet Union on the missiles issue, said
government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The decision came out of talks between leaders of the
government's governing coalition parties that forged a common
policy on the missile debate, sources said.
   Genscher and Stoltenberg are scheduled to fly to Washington on
Monday for talks with U.S. officials.
   West Germany has resisted strong U.S. and British calls to
upgrade the current aging generation of short-range nuclear
missiles.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants NATO to postpone a decision on the
missiles until after West Germany's national election in December
1990.
   Kohl's party has lost heavily in recent state elections and a
decision to replace the aging missiles with new weapons would be
unpopular with voters in West Germany, where the current missiles
are deployed and where the new ones would also be located.
   Genscher has repeatedly called for early talks with the Warsaw
Pact to reduce the number of short-range missiles.
   The United States and Britian are strongly opposed to early
talks, contending that Warsaw Pact superiority in conventional
weapons requires a Western nuclear deterrent of short-range weapons.
   A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers that ended Thursday
in Brussels sidestepped the issue.
   Government sources said that during the coalition talks, leaders
of Bavaria's conservative Christian Social Union Party agreed to
drop their long-standing opposition to early talks on short-range
missiles.
   The position paper also reiterates Kohl's view that a West
German decision on deployment of the modernized weapons is not
necessary until 1991 or 1992.
   The policy document urges the United States and the Soviet Union
to negotiate on reduction of the missiles during the interim.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog said the ruling
coalition parties agreed on the common stand on the missile issue
during an intensive round of talks in Bonn late Thursday.
   Chrobog refused to give details until NATO allies had been
informed of the results of the talks.
   Government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl had telephoned
President Bush on Friday to inform him of the West German position.
He refused to elaborate.
   During the NATO meeting that ended Thursday, the United States
and Britain sought strong backing for plans to modernize the
arsenal, while several European nations pressed for early
negotiations with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to reduce the missiles.
   The May 29-30 summit in Brussels is scheduled to discuss a
blueprint for the 16-nation NATO's future arms control strategy and
will have to tackle some of the modernization issues the allies
skipped over this week.
   A senior U.S. official said Friday in Brussels that NATO may
fail to resolve in the coming weeks its deep differences over
missile negotiations with the East bloc.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, raised the
possibility that NATO members would not reach a common position in
time for the May summit.
   ``We may in fact find ourselves at the summit with still
serious, genuine differences, and in that case they may not be able
to be bridged,'' he said.
   Such an outcome probably would lead to speculation about
disarray in the Western alliance. The nations are struggling to
present a united front in the face of defense cut promises by
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that have wide public appeal.
   The current missiles have a range of a more than 60 miles.
   The upgraded missiles would be extended to more than 250 miles,
just under the limits of the 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty that
eliminated intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe. The
treaty covered missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,000 miles.

   The Associated Press and nine other news
organizations Friday sought to intervene in Oliver North's criminal
case in an effort to gain the release of a document that refers to
intelligence intercepts in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The news organizations want a court hearing on their motion for
access to a stipulation summarizing intelligence showing that top
Reagan administration officials knew at the time that a November
1985 shipment to Iran contained Hawk missiles.
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan read portions of the stipulation
in closing arguments Wednesday in U.S. District Court, but the
document wasn't publicly released.
   ``The First Amendment ... the common law privilege of access to
judicial records, the Classified Information Procedures Act and the
local rules of this court each requires that the public and press
to be provided access to this document,'' said the news
organizations.
   Sullivan's remarks from the stipulation apparently have been
deleted from the transcript of the closing argument and the news
organizations asked for access to a complete transcript.
   ``The extent of contemporaneous knowledge by United States
government officials of this arms shipment, and of later attempts
to cover up such knowledge, has long been a major focus of
attention in the overall Iran-Contra affair,'' said the filing in
U.S. District Court.
   In his closing arguments, Sullivan said the stipulation had been
reached with the government about what 168 intercepts _ which
remain classified _ showed and to whom they were distributed by
special courier.
   Those receiving the intercepts were CIA director William Casey,
deputy national security adviser John Poindexter, Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger and national security adviser Robert
McFarlane and others.
   Sullivan said the intercepts showed that officials knew at the
time that missiles were shipped and even what ocean they were over
at a particular time and when they got there.
   The intercepts remain classified and the court has refused to
make the stipulation available, saying it is for jurors' eyes only,
said the court filing by the news organizations. The jury in the
North case began deliberations Friday.
   North is accused of compiling a false chronology in November
1986 which said that no one in the U.S. government knew until
January 1986 that the November 1985 shipment contained Hawk
missiles. North attended a Nov. 20, 1986 meeting with Casey and
Poindexter and North testified that neither man indicated knowledge
that Hawk missiles had been aboard the Iran-bound aircraft.
   The other news organizations filing the motion are Cable News
Network Inc., Capital Cities-ABC Inc., CBS Inc., Dow Jones &amp; Co.
Inc., National Broadcasting Co. Inc., National Public Radio, The
New York Times Co., the Times Mirror Co., and The Washington Post.

   A mile-long wagon train creaked into this
former territorial capital Friday to the cheers of celebrants
gathering for the centennial of the state's first historic land
rush.
   An estimated 1,000 people came to the windswept banks of the
Cimarron River to greet the wagons and horseback riders who trekked
75 miles from Caldwell and Arkansas City, Kan., to re-trace the
route of their pioneer predecessors.
   On April 22, 1889, more than 40,000 hopeful settlers converged
on the borders of the 2 million-acre Unassigned Lands in what is
now central Oklahoma.
   But in Oklahoma City, 25 miles to the south, Native Americans at
a Capitol steps rally were told that they should no more celebrate
the centennial of the run than Jews should celebrate the Holocaust.
   ``It offends me that Indian tax dollars are going to promote
this celebration,'' said Frances Wise, director of Oklahoma City's
Native American Center.
   ``The only time the state of Oklahoma tries to be nice to us ...
is when they want us to sing and dance for them,'' she said.
   President Benjamin Harrison authorized white settlement of the
former Indian land. The result was a mad dash for 160-acre parcels
and town lots in what was called ``Harrison's Hoss Race.''
   Oklahomans trace their state's roots to the Run of '89 at noon
on that April 22nd.
   It was the first in a series of land openings _ rushes,
lotteries, allotments and biddings _ that paved the way for
Oklahoma to become the 46th state in 1907.
   Guthrie served as the state's capital until 1910 and its
architecture has remained largely frozen in the Victorian era. Some
40 blocks of the town of 10,000 is in the National Register of
Historic Places.
   Women in 19th century garb strolled the town's brick sidewalks
Friday. Cavalry troops pounded in tent pegs to bivouac on a grassy
downtown lot while schoolchildren arrived by the busload to sample
the town's historic fare.
   The town primped for a Saturday crowd officials estimated would
be around 50,000. Officials prepared for gigantic traffic jams
should the total go higher.
   ``Any more and I think we'll be walking on each other,'' said
Carl Sachs, Guthrie Economic Development director. ``I don't think
there's anything we can do to stop it now.''
   In Oklahoma City, an estimated 10,000 people lined downtown
streets Friday afternoon to cheer high school bands, waving
politicians and centennial parade floats.
   Both Guthrie and Oklahoma City sprang full-grown from the
prairie as tent cities of 10,000 on the day of the run, which
settled part or all of six counties.
   Ms. Wise and other speakers said Friday's two-hour rally, which
culminated in a five-mile march through downtown Oklahoma City
hours before the start of the centennial parade, was the first in a
series of counter events scheduled for the centennial year.
   Some of the marchers wore black armbands and many wore T-shirts
proclaiming ``Sooners Run Over Indian Nation.'' Other T-shirts had
a picture of a covered wagon and the slogan, ``There Goes the
Neighborhood.''
   Historians say there is little argument that the government
cheated Indians of their land in Oklahoma. Organizers of centennial
observances say they have tried to be sensitive to Indian concerns.
   Wilma Mankiller, chief of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, said
her primary concern is that celebrators recognize the land rush did
not bring the first civilization to Oklahoma.
   The Cherokees and other tribes in eastern Oklahoma had a
Democratic government, brick buildings, and some of the nation's
first schools for women 50 years earlier, she said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's peace movement is at a difficult
juncture as concerns over the environment, AIDS, and the homeless
overshadow powderkegs like the Middle East, South Africa and
Central America, a new report concludes.
   Despite shifting attentions, peace activism has become a
national institution, having consolidated power and influence in
the arms control establishment and in citizens groups throughout
the country, the report says.
   The next challenge, says the inaugural issue of what will be a
yearly report, is to meld peace activism with the changing issues
of the 1990s _ with the Vietnam war a distant memory and the Soviet
Union a lessening threat.
   ``Our task now is make policymakers realize the Cold War is
winding down,'' said John Tirman, editor of the Annual Review of
Peace Activism and head of the Boston-based Winston Foundation for
World Peace.
   ``The kind of bitter, ideological military confrontation that
has marked the last 40 years is dissipating. We're trying to
develop a more positive vision of change.''
   The report has 15 essays by political scientists, activists and
environmentalists on such topics as ``The Plutonium Challenge in
the American West,'' ``The Human Rights Challenge'' and ``The
Battle for Nuclear Age Education.''
   Since its inception in the mid-1960s during the Vietnam war, the
peace movement has gone through two distinct stages, Tirman said.
The youth-oriented activism of the Vietnam era lasted until about
1973, he said.
   But when people began turning their attention to the environment
and women's issues, the peace movement waned. The movement was not
revived until then-President Jimmy Carter's decision to build and
deploy the MX missile in 1979, and later President Reagan's
description of the Soviet Union as the `'evil empire.''
   The peace movement's image must stay in step with the times or
risk losing touch with issues of international security and the
environment that threaten the country as much as the Vietnam war
two decades ago, Tirman said.
   ``Until 1986, this movement was basically in opposition to
something,'' Tirman said. ``Now we're in a state of flux. We need
to address other issues, like the fact that the U.S. is being left
with a $300 billion defense budget at a time when Gorbachev is
ahead of us in making concessions.''
   Though still predominantly a ``white, middle class'' movement,
peace activism has claimed a more diverse membership in recent
years.
   ``It's everyone from homemakers concerned about what their
children eat to businessmen and women angry at the amount of waste
in the Pentagon to people who are just plain angry about the
nuclear war,'' said Tirman.
   As a result, the peace movement has helped shape policy more
effectively than in the past, Tirman said.
   Tirman credits the peace movement with Reagan's decision to sign
the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, although some
contributors to the report say peace activism in the 1980s was only
moderately successful.
   ``In the end, the peace movement of the Reagan era had to settle
for indirect influence and partial success,'' writes Pam Solo in a
review article entitled ``The Reagan Era: The Freeze Campaign and
Political Power.''
   More than $50 million is donated toward the peace movement every
year, according to the report. There are more than 50 research
organizations and about 7,300 smaller groups dedicated to the peace
movement.

   Temperatures were in the 70s or 80s across much of the nation
Friday with records set as readings reached into the 80s to around
90 degrees across the central and southern Plains and into the mid
90s in southwest Texas.
   Temperatures were in the 50s and 60s from North Dakota through
the upper Great Lakes into New England and from the central and
northern Pacific Coast into the northern Rockies.
   A cold front draped across the northwestern U.S. Showers and a
few thunderstorms were scattered from the northern Rockies into the
central Pacific Coast region. Gusty thunderstorm winds flipped an
awning over and carried it up to 70 feet near Great Falls, Mont.
   Records were broken for this date in Colorado in Alamosa, where
it was 78, breaking a 1958 record of 77 and in Colorado Springs
where it was 82, breaking a 1960 record of 81. Denver, with 85,
tied its 1960 record. Goodland, Texas, broke a 1925 record of 86
with a high of 87. Lincoln, Neb., with 91 broke a 1980 record of
90; Scottsbluff, Neb., with 91, broke a 1980 record of 88; and in
Tucson, Ariz., where it was 100, a 1965 record of 98 was broken.
   The low in the nation Friday was 24 degrees at Concord, N.H.;
Houlton, Maine; Massena, N.Y., and Montpelier and St. Johnsbury, Vt.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. ranged from 39 degrees
at Klamath Falls, Ore., to 100 degrees at Tucson, Ariz.
   The forecast for Saturday called for widespread showers and
widely scattered thunderstorms from the Pacific Northwest through
the northern Plateau into the northern Rockies. Widely scattered
showers were expected from eastern North Dakota and western
Minnesota into southwest Wisconsin and across northern Maine. Much
of the remainder of the nation was expected to be sunny and warm.
   High temperatures were forecast for the 70s or 80s across much
of the nation. Highs in the 60s were predicted from the Northern
California coast through the Great Basin into the northern Rockies
with highs in the 50s across the Pacific Northwest and in the 50s
and 60s from the upper Great Lakes through the central Appalachians
into the mid-Atlantic Coast. Highs were predicted in the 40s from
the northeastern parts of the Great Lakes into much of New England.
Temperatures in the 90s were expected from the Desert Southwest
through the southern Rockies into the central and southern high
Plains and in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.

<HEAD>US Praises Lebanon Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials said Friday the United States
is energetically supporting an Arab League proposal for cease-fire
in Lebanon and is not tilting to Syria.
   ``We very strongly support this effort by the Arab League and
we're very encouraged by the reports that we've seen'' about it,
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   He said the United States is ``engaged in an energetic
initiative to support the Arab League...we're talking to the Arab
League, we're talking to the Syrians, we're talking to the parties
in Lebanon about the Arab League initiative and our hopes and our
support that it go forward.''
   He described the Arab League proposal as ``a peace plan'' that
involves cease-fire negotiations with Syria on its role in Lebanon
and a dialogue among Lebanese leaders for political reform.
   At the White House, President Bush met a group of
Lebanese-American leaders, and across the street 2,000 people
demonstrated to urge the Bush administration to use pressure to get
Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon and halt attacks against
Lebanese Christian enclaves.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States
would like to see a cease-fire and ``an end to violence on all
sides by all parties.''
   Boucher brushed aside Palestine Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat's latest proposal to meet Secretary of State James
Baker III, saying merely that current U.S.-PLO meetings would
continue in Tunis.
   On PLO support of elections in Israeli-occupied areas, Boucher
said, ``We've noted what he said about the election idea. We want
to continue to explore the idea.''

   Hundreds of rioters smashed bank windows,
looted buildings and pelted police officers with rocks Friday as
riots caused by price increases spread to northern Jordan.
   Troops banned Moslems from weekly prayers in troubled southern
cities in an attempt to prevent more unrest, which has killed eight
people.
   King Hussein, visiting Washington, canceled a trip to Britain
scheduled to begin Saturday and planned to return to Jordan, the
Jordanian Embassy in London said.
   In Salt, a city of 100,000 12 miles north of Amman, children
played inside shattered offices and hundreds of people milled
around on the glass-strewn streets.
   Demonstrators called for the ouster of Prime Minister Zaid
Rifai, whom they blame for austerity measures and declining living
standards. They shouted support for Hussein.
   ``We are fed up with this government. They have stolen all our
money,'' said a man in his 60s who refused to give his name. He
said demonstrators ``trust the king's leadership and we know he
will respond.''
   Riots also occurred Thursday night in the northern towns of
Madaba and Tayyba.
   It was the first time disturbances had spread beyond the south
since the unrest began Tuesday in the southern city of Maan. The
demonstrations came in response to price increases of 10 percent to
50 percent on gasoline, cigarettes, heating oil and other
commodities.
   The increases were imposed Sunday as part of an agreement with
the International Monetary Fund to reschedule Jordan's $6 billion
foreign debt. They came on top of rising unemployment and soaring
inflation.
   Residents of Maan and other southern cities said soldiers
prevented people from attending Friday prayers at mosques.
Cancellation of Friday prayers is highly unusual in an Islamic
country.
   The Koran, Islam's holy book, calls on Moslems to participate in
the ceremony, and most take it as a binding duty.
   Government officials earlier had hinted that Moslem
fundamentalists had inflamed the unrest, the worst domestic
violence since the 1970-71 war between the army and Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrillas.
   Most of the rioting has involved native Jordanians, not the
Palestinian half of the population.
   An official statement read on state-run radio said four
civilians and one policeman had died in Maan, and it blamed the
deaths on ``shootings by the rioters.''
   Residents of the city earlier had blamed the civilian deaths on
the army, although they said rioters also were firing weapons.
   Three other people were reported killed in Mazar, 55 miles south
of Amman.
   State-run Jordan Television broadcast an appeal to Jordanians
Friday night to end the violence, for the first time showing
pictures of smashed buildings and destroyed vehicles.
   ``These are the services which the government tried to provide
for the whole country and we paid with our tears and with our sweat
and with our blood to have them built,'' said Mohammed Amin, the
Jordan Television director who narrated the 20-minute program.
   ``These were destroyed by a bunch of terrorists.''
   He said because of the damage, ``We will not pass this stage (of
economic difficulty) as quickly as we thought because now we have
added pressure.''
   Israeli radio and TV were reporting the difficulties ``to
instigate problems,'' he said, and ``news agencies are exaggerating
the picture of the situation.''
   About 1,000 people demonstrated Thursday night in Tayyba, a town
40 miles northwest of Amman.
   Mayor Mahmoud Awneh said rioters smashed windows in a school and
the town hall. He denounced the riot, but also criticized the price
rises.
   ``They shouldn't have raised the prices so much.'' He said.
``They should have increased them slowly ... When you do it 50
percent, the people can't afford it.''
   Relatives of Communist Party members said government agents
arrested about 100 party members overnight after the party
distributed a leaflet demanding the government scrap the price
rises and cancel its austerity plan.
   The government, as is common, made no report of the arrests.

   Thousands of radical students aligned
with militant labor unions battled police Friday around university
campuses in Seoul and the southeastern cities of Kwangju and Iri.
   The Defense Ministry announced Friday it would mobilize up to
80,000 military technicians and engineers to keep key industries
running if workers go on strike.
   The government of President Roh Tae-woo said this week it would
use troops to keep important industries operating.
   The government has said strikes in recent months have cost the
economy $2 billion in lost production.
   More than 2,000 students left the campuses of Konkuk, Hankook,
Seoul National and Yonsei universitites in Seoul and used firebombs
and rocks to fight with police who respondsed with volleys of tear
gas.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Yankee go home!'' the students
yelled as they beat drums and brass gongs in the third day of
campus demonstrations in the capital.
   The Yonhap news agency reported hundreds of student activists
clashed with police in Kwangju and Iri.
   Police officials said some people were injured but they had no
figures on the number or how many arrests were made.
   In other developments, National Assemblyman Suh Suk-jae was
arrested on charges of bribing a candidate to drop out of a
by-election, prosecutors announced.
   They said Suh,a member of the opposition Reunification
Democratic Party, had paid $75,000 to candicate Lee Hong-sup of the
minor New Democratic Republican Party to abandon the race in the
four-way election Friday in the eastern electoral district of
Tonhgae.
   The candidate of the governing Democratic Justice Party won the
seat. The scandal surfaced just before the election when Lee
acknowledged receiving money from Suh. Lee subsequently was
arrested and accused of accepting a bribe.
   Suh resigned as secretary-general of the Reunification
Democratic Party on Saturday after telling a news conference he had
given money to Lee and assumed responsibility for the incident.
   Yonhap reported immigration authorities refused to grant
permission to land to 49 Vietnamese boat people rescued at sea by a
British freighter.
   It said the permission was denied because South Korea's only
camp for such refugees is overcrowded. The camp has 235 Vietnamese,
55 more than it can accommodate, according to the agency.
   Yonhap said the boat people were picked up April 16 betwen
Malaysia and Vietnam by the British vessel Cardigan Bay.
   Since 1976 South Korea has temporarily accepted about 2,000
Vietnamese refugees with the condition they resettle in third
nations.

<HEAD>Unitd Nations Begins Relief Shipments To Southern Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge C-130 cargo plane carrying 15{
tons of corn landed in the southern Sudanese city of Torit on
Friday as the United Nations started up relief operations after a
deadly ambush caused a three-day delay.
   Paul Mitchell, a spokesman for the United Nations' Operation
Lifeline Sudan, told the Associated Press the plane arrived safely
in the beleaguered town after leaving Uganda's Entebbe airport
before dawn.
   A 47-truck relief convoy carrying 1,100 tons to southern Sudan
also began Friday with the first trucks rolling out of Kampala
before noon, said Gote Hertz, a U.N. spokesman in Kampala.
   Mitchell said the C-130, leased from and operated by the
Miami-based Southern Air Transport company, will make three flights
daily to Torit until it has delivered 1,100 tons.
   The airlift and convoy are part of a massive, $132 million U.N.
effort to stock more than 110,000 tons of food and supplies in
wartorn southern Sudan before heavy seasonal rains begin in four
weeks.
   The operation hopes to avoid a repetition of last year's
tragedy, when up to 500,000 people died of famine induced by
drought, floods and a rebellion by the Sudan People's Liberation
Army.
   The Liberation Army began its rebellion in early 1983, demanding
greater autonomy and economic reforms in the three southern
provinces of Bahr Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria.
   The first U.N. convoy in rebel-held southern Sudan was ambushed
on Tuesday as it traveled west to Torit from the Sudan People's
Liberation Army base of Kapoeta. Eight rebel escorts were killed
and the lead truck was destroyed. U.N. officials have not assessed
blame, but suspicion fell on tribal raiders, government troops or
government militias fighting the rebels.
   Mitchell said Friday's flight represented the start of the first
significant shipment of relief food to Torit. The Norwegian
People's Aid and World Vision relief agencies have delivered just
under 100 tons to Torit since April 1, he said.
   The C-130 until Tuesday was one of two planes carrying food into
the southern Sudanese provincial capital of Juba, which is
continuing to receive 55 tons of relief supplies daily on the
remaining C-130, said Hertz.
   He said the truck convoy will head first to the Sudanese border
town of Nimule, and leave perhaps 110 tons of food and supplies for
an unknown number of displaced people there, said Hertz.
   From Nimule, it will continue on to Torit only if convoy leaders
believe conditions are safe and no threat exists of land mines
along the route, he said.
   In recent weeks, Torit's civilian population swelled from 3,000
to 25,000 as displaced southerners pour in from the surrounding
bush. U.N. officials expect the population to climb to 50,000 in
the coming weeks.

<HEAD>Skinner To Europe To Push Aviation Security Steps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner set
out Friday for Europe on a quest to improve international aviation
security, while rejecting calls from victims of the Pan Am Flight
103 bombing for a broad investigation into the incident.
   ``My job is to get this problem solved and to put the best, most
effective program of antiterrorism into place,'' Skinner said in a
statement prior to his departure for Naples, Italy, aboard a
Federal Aviation Administration plane.
   Skinner is to meet during the weekend with the administration's
nominee for FAA administrator, Adm. James B. Busey, who is U.S.
Navy commander for Europe. The secretary is meeting next week with
government and airline officials in Italy, West Germany,
Switzerland, France and England to push for security initiatives he
said would ``encourage international travelers to retain their
justified confidence in the system's safety.''
   Skinner, in a news conference for foreign journalists covering
Washington, said U.S. carriers have given ``unbelievable
attention'' to security and are the safest in the world.
   His spokesman, David Prosperi, said Skinner and other
transportation and security officials were flying most of the way
on a government plane to meet a tight schedule but would likely
make at least part of the trip aboard a commercial airline.
   Skinner, in a letter Friday to the brother of one of the 270
people killed in the Pan Am explosion over Scotland, said President
Bush had rejected the relatives' request that he appoint an
independent commission to investigate the Dec. 21 bombing.
   ``For a variety of reasons, we do not believe formation of an
independent commission is necessary or prudent,'' said Skinner in
the letter to Bert Ammerman, which was accompanied by a five-page
outline of administration action since the Pan Am explosion.
   Ammerman, of Demarest, N.J., said in a telephone interview the
victims' families still believe there is enough evidence to justify
a full investigation by Congress. Among concerns of the relatives
of 200 Americans killed in the bombing are the lack of a public
warning of threats against the flight, security procedures that
failed to detect the plastic explosive which authorities say was
believed planted by terrorists, and inadequate government response
after the incident.
   Ammerman said he met recently with Secretary of State James
Baker III and received assurances that relatives will receive
better treatment than they have, including State Department escorts
for those who visit the town of Lockerbie, Scotland, where the
plane went down.
   Prosperi said Skinner had no plan to go to Lockerbie during his
European visit.
   Skinner said he had confidence in the investigation by Scottish
and West German authorities and the FBI and believed those
responsible for planting the bomb, which investigators have said
was hidden in a radio-cassette, will be apprehended and prosecuted.
   ``I can assure you that in my opinion the investigation is
moving at full speed,'' Skinner said. ``I think that eventually and
hopefully in the not too distant future, the public will know the
full story there.'' He said it was important not to disclose
targets of the investigation or the information being sought.
   Skinner said his trip would review screening given foreign
nationals hired by U.S. airlines abroad and seek diplomatic
approval for installation of devices to detect plastic explosives
in airports used by U.S. carriers abroad.
   The secretary said he has no evidence that large numbers of
government employees cancelled reservations on Flight 103 after a
notice of a terrorist threat against U.S. carriers was erroneously
posted in the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
   In both the news conference and documents sent to Ammerman, he
reiterated the policy that ``if there's a significant enough threat
to advise government employees, the American public will be
advised.''
   He noted that several government employees were among those
killed.

<TEXT>
   The No. 1 suspect in 12 drug-related
torture slayings near Agua Prieta, Mexico, was in U.S. custody
Friday, awaiting extradition or deportation, Border Patrol
officials said.
   Hector Fragoso Burgueno, 45, was arrested late Thursday at a
mobile home in an isolated desert area south of Three Points, a
small community about 30 miles west of Tucson, Pima County Sheriff
Clarence Dupnik said.
   Like the ritual slayings of 15 people in Matamoros discovered
last week, authorities consider the Agua Prieta ranch killings to
be drug-related.
   Fragoso, who owned the ranch where the bodies were found last
month, had shaved his moustache, changed his hair style and altered
his eyebrows, but ``he was readily identifiable,'' said Pima County
Sheriff's Maj. Dennis Douglas.
   Enrique Cecena, zone commander with the Sonora State Judicial
Police, said the Sonora attorney general's office will file the
formal request for Fragoso's return to Mexico that U.S. authorities
said they were awaiting.
   ``He's the principal one, according to the witnesses,'' Cecena
said from Nogales, Mexico.
   Scott Coffin, deputy chief agent for the Border Patrol in
Tucson, said Fragoso was being held as an illegal alien under a
federal immigration arrest warrant on administrative charges.
   Authorities have not yet decided on whether extradition or
deportation proceedings would be the best way to return Fragosa to
Mexico, said Border Patrol spokesman Ed Pyeatt.
   Douglas and the Drug Enforcement Administration said Fragoso and
the Agua Prieta slayings may be linked to the torture and stabbing
deaths of two men from Arizona and three from Sonora whose bodies
were found in a Tucson shed shortly before the Agua Prieta bodies
were discovered.
   Tucson homicide detectives have declined comment on that point.
However, Dupnik said Tucson's homicide detail was among officers at
the arrest site.
   Douglas said investigators developed leads on Fragoso's
whereabouts through various tips, including a local crime hotline,
calls to the television show ``America's Most Wanted'' and
confidential sources.
   The TV show aired a segment on Fragoso last week that prompted
116 phone calls, Douglas said. He said the show was ``a building
block in our investigation'' but not a principal factor in finding
Fragoso.
   A woman taken into custody with Fragoso was listed in a DEA
statement as Anna Marie Fregosa and described as his wife, but
Border Patrol and sheriff's officials said they did not have the
woman's identification and that her relationship was unclear.
   The DEA said she will be deported voluntarily to Mexico.
   Various reports had described Fragoso as a United States
citizen, but Coffin said ``all the evidence'' in Fragoso's file
pointed to his being a Mexican citizen.
   The 12 Agua Prieta victims included nine who were found March 29
and three others found April 12, all at the ranch two miles west of
the Sonoran border city directly across from Douglas. Some of the
mutilated bodies had been dumped in a well; others were buried in a
septic tank.
   Cecena said 11 of the victims apparently were killed after they
witnessed the murder of another person.
   Fragoso, described by Mexican police as a drug trafficker, also
is known as ``Tombstone'' for what's alleged to be his practice of
burying competitors. Authorities say he may have been the enforcer
for a drug ring called Los Tios, ``The Uncles.''
   The DEA said it first became aware of Fragoso when he was
arrested in 1974 for possession of 2,400 pounds of marijuana. He
was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison. He escaped in
January 1978 but was recaptured the following March in Safford, the
DEA said.
   While in jail, Fragoso was convicted of assault on a federal
officer, the DEA said. He was released in the early 1980s but
subsequently was arrested in the United States on charges of rape
and armed robbery, the DEA said without giving the outcome of those
cases.

<HEAD>Wright, Mallick Go on Offensive in Interviews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright's wife gave
important investment advice to the local partnership targeted in a
House ethics committee inquiry of Wright, chief partner George
Mallick says.
   ``She earned her money,'' Mallick told the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram in an interview published Friday. ``She was a
bona-fide employee.''
   The speaker faces 69 allegations of House rules violations
brought by the ethics committee. Among the accusations is that his
wife, Betty, was paid an $18,000-a-year salary by Mallick for work
she did not do for the Fort Worth-based investment firm, Mallightco
Inc.
   The ethics committee's special counsel, Richard Phelan, said in
a statement April 11 that Betty Wright had failed to document that
she worked more than 12 days over a four-year period for Mallick.
An attorney for Jim Wright, William Oldaker, said he presented
``specific testimony'' that she worked five to seven days a month.
   In an interview in The Washington Post published Friday, Mrs.
Wright said the firm was a ``a piddling little mom-and-pop
operation'' and she never kept any records of her work.
   Mallick, however, said Mrs. Wright was ``an integral part of the
decision-making'' when Mallightco was considering investments.
   In one instance, Mallick said he changed his mind on her advice
and decided against entering an oil company deal in which
Mallightco ``would have lost at least $25,000 and maybe up to
$200,000.''
   The House ethics committee is trying to determine whether
Mallick tried to influence legislation through his relationship to
Wright. Mallick said he never has.
   ``I've never asked the speaker, in the 30 years I've known him,
to vote one way or another on a piece of legislation,'' he said.
   He also said Wright had no knowledge of a 1988 gas well
investment in which Mallightco turned a $340,880 profit because the
speaker had put his holdings in a blind trust in 1987.
   Mallick criticized Phelan's report, saying he was ``convinced
(the report) was written in the cycle of the full moon _ it's
lunacy.''
   In a separate interview, Wright told the Star-Telegram that the
ethics probe has been an ``agonizing experience'' and he ``never
dreamed it would drag on this long.''
   ``I have tried to cultivate a quality of forgiveness. I must not
allow myself to be embittered against those who have said vicious
things about me. It isn't easy,'' he said.
   Wright said he believes his detractors have engaged in more
unethical behavior than anything he has been accused of.
   ``The most unethical behavior I've observed by any colleague is
the deliberate attempt to ruin another colleague's reputation,''
Wright said, in an obvious reference to his Republican foe, Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania's Super 7 Jackpot Guaranteed to Hit Record $70 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pennsylvania Lottery's Super 7 jackpot
reached an estimated world record of $70 million on Friday, and was
expected to keep climbing through Wednesday's drawing, lottery
officials said.
   Lottery spokeswoman Terry Murphy said sales are booming; nearly
7 million tickets were sold Thursday and Friday. Lottery officials
will continue to update the value of the pot as sales continue, she
said.
   ``I'm having a hard time just saying $70 million now,'' she
said. ``I don't know where it's going to end up. We won't know that
until Thursday morning.''
   The total, estimated from sales figures, apparently broke a
1-week-old world record of $69.9 million set in Illinois on April
15. That was split by four ticket holders.
   The Super 7 jackpot was climbing to unprecedented heights
because no one has bought a winning ticket for six weeks, Ms.
Murphy said.
   If one person gets a ticket with seven of the 11 winning numbers
in the $70 million jackpot, he or she would receive $2.69 million a
year for 26 years.
   Prior to the Illinois record, the world record set last fall was
a $61.98 million jackpot split among buyers of three tickets in the
California lottery.
   Pennsylvania's own largest previous jackpot was $46 million in
the Super 7 game, won by a Hollidaysburg couple on Oct. 14, 1987.
   Lottery officials are urging players to buy tickets early to
avoid long lines at lottery retail outlets. Players also should
only buy as many tickets as they can afford, Ms. Murphy said.
   Alease Green, assistant manager of a Sheetz convenience store in
Harrisburg, said people have formed lines up and down the aisles of
the store, waiting to buy tickets.
   ``There's been a lot today,'' she said. ``There's going to be
lots more, too, I'm sure.''

<HEAD>Poll Says A Third of Ruling Party's Lawmakers Want Takeshita Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a third of his party's parliamentary
members who responded to a poll think Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita should resign soon because of the Recruit bribery
scandal, a newspaper reported Friday.
   The nationwide daily Mainichi Shimbun polled all 296 Liberal
Democrats in the 512-member House of Representatives from April
17-19.
   It said that of 168 lawmakers who responded to the survey, 35.7
percent thought Takeshita should resign to restore public
confidence in the government.
   They included 3.6 percent who said he should step down
immediately; 25.6 percent who said he should wait until the fiscal
1989 national budget is enacted, and 6.5 percent who said the
budget should just pass the House first.
   Opposition parties have boycotted parliamentary debate on the
budget for the fiscal year that began April 1, demanding that
Takeshita resign.
   They also want former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to
testify in parliament on his involvement in the scandal surrounding
Recruit Co., an information services conglomerate suspected of
using political contributions and other financial transactions to
gain favors from politicians and bureaucrats.
   The Mainichi poll indicated 37.5 percent of the respondents were
in favor of Nakasone's testifying.
   The government is operating on a 50-day provisional budget.
Political analysts say Takeshita must resolve the budget stalemate
before leaving on April 28 for a summit of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations in Jakarta, Indonesia.
   Takeshita has rejected calls for his resignation, vowing instead
to carry out political reforms to restore public trust in
government. Nakasone refuses to appear before parliament, saying
his links to Recruit were clarified at a news conference.
   In a poll conducted by Kyodo News Service released this month,
the prime minister's popular support rating dropped to an all-time
low of 3.9 percent. The poll was conducted shortly after Takeshita
acknowledged he received more than 130 million yen (about $1
million) from Recruit Co.
   Recuit also sold hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in a
subsidiary at bargain prices to about 160 influential politicians,
public officials and business people. The purchasers reaped
substantial profits when the price of the shares soared after
over-the-counter trading began in October 1986.
   Seventeen politicians and their aides reportedly profited from
the stock transactions.
   Three Cabinet members resigned in connection with the Recruit
scandal, and 14 people, including two former vice ministers, were
arrested on suspicion of bribery or securities exchange law
violations.

<HEAD>Crime Boss Wounded, Three Bodyguards Die in Italian Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A squad of gunmen ambushed a reputed boss
of the Camorra organized crime syndicate Friday, killing three of
his bodyguards in a hail of more than 100 bullets but only wounding
their main target, police reported.
   Another bodyguard and a 7-year-old passer-by also were wounded
in the midday shooting in the Naples suburb of Castellammare di
Stabia, police and hospital officials said.
   Authorities said Michele D'Alessandro was ambushed as he and his
guards were riding on three motorcycles to the local police
station. He is free pending appeal of a life sentence for murder,
but must report to police daily.
   The Italian news agency AGI said the group was blocked by a team
of at least 10 assassins who fired submachine guns, pistols and
sawed-off shotguns. The killers fled in two cars and several
motorcyles.
   The dead were identified as Giovanni Grieco, 21, Pasquale
Santarpia, 32, and D'Alessandro's 26-year-old brother, Domenico.
   Michele D'Alessandro, 44, who was on the back of his brother's
motorcycle, was hit by three bullets in the right leg. Police said
the motorcycle fell on top of him, acting as a shield.
   One guard, Giuseppe Sicignano, 31, was in critical condition.
Carmine Iovine, a boy who was riding nearby on a motorbike with his
grandfather, was wounded in the ankle.
   Police believed the shooting was part of a war between rival
clans of the Camorra, the Neapolitan version of the Mafia which
controls drug trafficking and extortion rackets in this southern
city.
   Police described D'Alessandro as the top boss of the Camorra in
Castellammare di Stabia.
   Dozens of police guarded D'Alessandro at a local hospital.
Police said he refused to cooperate with investigators.

<HEAD>Former Romanian Foreign Minister Reported Ill, Under House Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's former Foreign Minister
Corneliu Manescu, who denounced abuses in Romania in a letter to
President Nicolae Ceausescu, is under house arrest and in critical
condition, a Hungarian daily said Friday.
   In an article carried by the Communist Party newspaper
Nepszabadsag, Hungarian former Foreign Minister Janos Peter said
the 73-year-old Manescu is also threatened with deportation from
Romania and a court trial.
   Peter said he learned about Manescu's problems from reliable
sources. He invited him to Hungary for medical treatment and said
he hoped Romanian authorities would allow the visit out of
humanitarian considerations.
   Manescu was Romania's chief diplomat from 1961-1972.
   He was one of six top Romanian Communists who wrote Ceausescu
last month demanding an immediate halt to food exports from
shortage-plagued Romania. They detailed other abuses, such as
forced Sunday labor and systematic violations of private mail and
telephone communications.
   Following publication of the letter in the West last month, the
signatories reported police harassment and threats of deportation
and expulsion from the party if they don't recant on the letter.
   ``I have been reliably informed that Manescu is being kept short
of food. The news is particularly alarming since I know that (he)
suffers from a grave constriction of vessels and has had a new
attack of gastric ulcer,'' Nepszabadsag quoted Peter as saying.
   ``Isolation, even if it is only house arrest, may cause his
death. It is no exaggeration to say that Manescu's life is in the
balance.''

   Left-wing guerrillas fired four
anti-tank rockets at the national navy compound in San Salvador
Friday, and two servicemen were wounded, the armed forces reported.
   An officer, who identified himself only as Capt. Castellanos,
said the two men were struck by shrapnel. He said damage was minor
to the compound, in a densely populated district in southern San
Salvador.
   The officer refused to allow reporters to enter the compound but
showed them holes that he said were made by the shoulder-fired
rockets.
   On April 7, guerrillas fired rockets at the national police
compound in San Salvador and three struck adjacent houses, killing
one civilian and wounding six others. No police injuries were
reported.
   The guerrillas in recent weeks have increased their activities
in the capital and have vowed to present President-elect Alfredo
Cristiani with ``an ungovernable country'' when he takes office
June 1.
   Cristiani, of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance,
defeated the candidate of the incumbent Christian Democratic Party
in the March 19 election.
   More than 70,000 people have been killed in the 9-year-old civil
war between the rebels and U.S.-backed government.

   A United Mine Workers official said Friday
the union is expanding its violence-marred strike against The
Pittston Coal Group to companies that are aiding Pittston.
   ``We've decided it has come to a head,'' said Howard Green, an
international board member from UMW District 17.
   The violence continued with rock-throwing at coal-truck convoys
near Pittston operations in Russell County, Va., Virginia state
police said.
   State troopers arrested 29 people and charged most of them with
throwing rocks at occupied vehicles, said Capt. Tom Flanary,
commander of the state police's 4th Division in Wytheville.
   Also Friday, UMW lawyers asked a Logan County judge to bar
Pittston security guards from harassing union pickets. That
followed Pittston's request that Judge Eric O'Briant limit the
number of union pickets in the county.
   About 1,700 UMW members have been on strike at Pittston
operations in Virginia and West Virginia since April 5. The union
accused the company of unfair labor practices in negotiating a
contract to replace one that expired 14 months ago. Pittston denies
the charges and has been hiring replacement workers.
   Green told The Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail that the union will
expand its 2-week-old strike to any company that is supplying coal
to Pittston to help it fulfill its contracts.
   ``We're not going to sit idly by and watch companies fill orders
for Pittston,'' he said. ``If you supply a renegade company like
Pittston, you will be considered a renegade yourself. The word is
going out.''
   Green also said that action later could include other companies
that have not signed a contract with the union. Green said as many
as 150 miners could go on strike by next week.
   At Friday's hearing in Logan County Circuit Court, a union
witness testified that he saw two Pittston guards drive past a
picket line with an uncased rifle or shotgun in the back seat.
   Other UMW witnesses said Pittston employees and guards sped past
picket lines, in one case coming within three feet of a union
shack. Some witnesses said they thought they had been followed by
the guards.
   Company lawyer John R. Woodrum said there was no evidence any
guards or employees did anything wrong.
   A day earlier, lawyers for two Pittston subsidiaries, Buffalo
and Elkay mining companies, asked O'Briant to limit the UMW to two
pickets at a time. The company contends that union members have
intimidated and harassed its employees and workers from companies
with which it does business.
   A judge in Russell County, Va., last week rejected Pittston's
request that the union be limited to two pickets at more than 30
sites but restricted the UMW to 10 pickets at two mines.
   About 40 UMW wives earlier this week staged a sit-in in the
lobby of Pittston's offices at Lebanon, Va. On Thursday, 35
strikers were arrested after a coal truck convoy was hit by a
barrage of rocks at Pittson's Moss No. 3 coal preparation plant in
Russell County, Va.
   In Buchanan County, Va., on Thursday, two miners attempting to
leave the R&amp;H Mine, a non-union contract producer for Pittston,
were injured when their truck was pelted by rocks and ran off the
road, Flanary said.
   The passenger in the truck was hit in the head with a metal pole
wielded by one of several UMW and non-union miners picketing at the
mine, Flanary said. The driver suffered a head injury when the
truck crashed.
   One of the picketing miners was charged with assault for the
attack with the metal pole and four others were charged with
throwing rocks at an occupied vehicle, Flanary said.

   President Bush and other U.S. officials
reacted with grief and anger Friday to the killing of Col. James
``Nick'' Rowe, the highly decorated former Vietnam prisoner of war
who was shot in the Philippines by suspected communist terrorists.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the
killing of Rowe ``a cowardly and heinous act.''
   ``Colonel Rowe was in the Philippines to help the Filipino
people in their efforts to defend democracy,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
will work closely with the Philippine government in their efforts
to track down and bring to justice those responsible for this
assassination.
   ``The U.S. government's support for Philippine democracy is
unshaken,'' said the White House spokesman.
   Rowe was ambushed by assassins who sprayed his armored car with
automatic weapons fire Friday morning as he was driven to his job
in suburban Manila. He was chief of the ground forces division of
the Army contingent at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in
the Philippines.
   ``The president and Mrs. Bush extend their deepest sympathy to
the family and friends of Colonel Rowe,'' said Fitzwater.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called Rowe ``a true hero whose
military career exemplified dedication to his country and to
freedom.''
   ``This cowardly act of terrorism against this brave and
dedicated individual is a tragic reminder that the freedom we
cherish has been obtained at great cost by those who have been
willing to protect it,'' Cheney said in a statement.
   Rowe was to be buried next week at Arlington National Cemetery,
but the date had not been set, said Lt. Col. John Chapla. Rowe's
remains were to be flown first to Fayetteville, N.C., near the
Special Forces base at Fort Bragg, where he spent much of his
career.
   Army Chief of Staff Gen. Carl E. Vuono called Rowe ``a personal
friend ... who I knew to be a selfless and faithful soldier'' and a
defender of ``democracy and freedom at home and around the globe.''
   Born in McAllen, Texas, in 1938, Rowe graduated from West Point
Military Academy in 1960, and was commissioned as a second
lieutenant in the field artillery.
   Assigned to Vietnam in mid-1963, Rowe was captured in October
that year, held for five years by the Viet Cong, then escaped on
New Year's Eve 1968. He chronicled his ordeal in a book, ``Five
Years to Freedom.''
   ``A courageous soldier in Vietnam, Colonel Rowe kept faith with
the ideals of America even through his five years as a prisoner of
war,'' Vuono said in a statement.
   Rowe ``never let the enemy break his spirit, continuing to
resist throughout his captivity and eventually escaping,'' Vuono
added.
   Rowe left the Army but returned to active duty in 1981, serving
at the U.S. Army Center for Military Assistance at Fort Bragg,
running the center's survival, evasion, resistance and escape
division until he assumed command of the Special Warfare Training
Battalion there in May 1985.
   He was married and had three children, according to the Army.
   Vuono said that Rowe ``returned from his incarceration in
Vietnam with even greater determination to advance the cause of
freedom and democracy. He was pursuing that goal when the bullet of
a cowardly assassin cut him down''
   ``All of us who are left behind must take stock in the
courageous and determined example that Nick has given us,'' the
statement said.
   An Army biography of Rowe said that he had won the following
medals and awards, but did not give their dates: Silver Star,
Legion of Merit, Bronze Star (twice), Purple Heart (twice),
Meritorious Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam
Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry
Cross Unit Citation.

   A U.S. SR-71 Blackbird spy plane based in Okinawa
crashed in the South China Sea during a routine mission Friday, but
the two crewmen were rescued, U.S. officials said.
   The U.S. military in Japan said in a statement that the crew of
the aircraft, operating out of Kadena Air Base on Okinawa, reported
engine failure shortly after takeoff.
   Maj. Suzanne Randle, spokeswoman for the Strategic Air Command
at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Neb., said the plane crashed.
   Both crew members were picked up by helicopter in a search and
rescue mission, she said. The statement from the U.S. military in
Japan said the two were in good condition at Clark Air Base in the
Philippines.
   Ms. Randle declined to give more information. The statement
issued in Japan gave no other details, and a public affairs officer
at Kadena, in a telephone interview, declined to provide any
further information.
   The SR-71s entered service in January 1966, supplementing the
slower U-2 spy plane. The SR-71 flies faster than twice the speed
of sound at altitudes exceeding 80,000 feet, said the spokeswoman.
   The Air Force will not disclose the total number of SR-71s in
service or the number that have crashed, Ms. Randle said. The most
recent crash of an SR-71 occurred in 1972 at Kadena Air Base, she
said.

   Coretta Scott King lamented a lack of unity
among blacks and Rep. Ron Dellums blasted the budget priorities of
the president and Congress as the African American Summit '89
opened Friday.
   ``Today, we have more of what we fought for, more
African-American elected officials, more educational opportunity,
more access to public accommodations,'' said Mrs. King, widow of
Martin Luther King. ``Yet we have less unity than we had during the
civil rights movement.''
   Such unity must be regained if blacks are to overcome burgeoning
poverty and rise to positions of power in business and politics,
she said in her opening speech to the summit _ the first such
gathering since then-Mayor Richard Hatcher helped organize one in
Gary, Ind., in 1972.
   Hatcher is chairman of this conference, called to develop a
social and political agenda for blacks in the 1990s and deal with
such issues as threats to the black family, teen-age pregnancy and
drug abuse.
   A panel discussion on criminal justice was to include Angela
Davis, an activist who gained renown in the 1970s with her arrest
and acquittal on charges stemming from a 1970 shootout at the
Marion County Courthouse in northern California.
   Dellums, D-Calif., in his keynote speech before nearly 1,000
people, said blacks must concern themselves not just with domestic
problems, but also with oppression and poverty that afflict blacks
throughout the world.
   And he chastised Republican President George Bush and the
Democratic leadership of the Congress for this month's
much-heralded budget compromise.
   ``Most of the Congress and, as far as I'm concerned, the
executive branch have failed the moral test of what a national
budget ought to be,'' Dellums said.
   Dellums, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said that
group's own budget proposal would reduce the federal deficit by
$92.4 billion by placing a heavier tax burden on the wealthy and
reducing the military budget while increasing spending to feed the
poor, improve schools and build homes.
   ``We don't need MX missiles, and Midgetman and Trident missiles
and B-2 bombers and Star Wars,'' said Dellums. ``You can't feed
anybody with it, you can't educate anybody with it, you can't
create housing with it. It's madness.''
   In welcoming participants to the summit, Hatcher made an oblique
reference to the absence of National Black Republican Chairman Fred
Brown of New York, who last month withdrew after organizers
extended invitations to Davis and Black Muslim leader Louis
Farrakhan, who did not attend.
   ``This isn't about the people who aren't here,'' Hatcher said.
``It is about the people who are here.''
   Hatcher said he regretted the Republican leader's absence
because his early help in the conference was valuable and ``he has
something to offer that would certainly make this a better
meeting.''
   Fewer than 1,000 people were in the hall for speeches by
Dellums, Mrs. King and others, but Hatcher said he was not
perturbed by the relatively low attendance.
   ``It was the media that got into numbers,'' he said. ``The
people that cared enough to come, spend their own money, ... if
they cared enough to be here, then let me tell you something: my
expectations have been met.''

   The judge in a landmark AIDS lawsuit
drastically reduced a $21.75 million jury award to Rock Hudson's
lover Friday, ruling that Marc Christian should receive only $5.5
million.
   Superior Court Judge Bruce Geernaert called Hudson's behavior
``outrageous and reprehensible'' for not telling his lover of his
AIDS diagnosis, but he said the jury's ``passion'' had led it to
make an excessive award.
   In his written ruling, Geernaert said that both the compensatory
and punitive damages were excessive and he felt that the amounts he
set were sufficient to compensate Christian.
   Christian's lawyer, Harold Rhoden, said his client ``was as
disappointed as I am.'' But Christian later said he was delighted
even at the prospect of getting less than a third of what the jury
decided he should receive.
   Reached by telephone, Christian said he still felt he won
because the judge had removed any reason for appeal on grounds of
excessive damages.
   ``It's still a big award'' he said, noting he never expected
realistically to collect the larger figure.
   ``It was more symbolic than anything else,'' Christian said,
adding he believed the $5.5 million award ``still sends the same
message out,'' that those with AIDS must warn their sex partners.
   But Robert Parker Mills, the attorney for the Hudson estate,
said he believes his clients probably will appeal.
   ``There's not any evidence I can see that would substantiate a
$5 million award to this man,'' said Mills.
   The judge said he had given the matter much thought since an
earlier hearing when he suggested a figure of $3 million in
punitive damages.
   ``Upon further reflection, in light of the entire record, a
punitive damage award of $500,000 seems to fairly accomodate ...
the pertinent factors,'' Geernaert said. He set compensatory
damages at $5 million.
   Geenaert specified that these reductions would go into effect
only if Christian accepts them. If he does not consent, Geernaert
said he would order a new trial on damages.
   ``The court finds that the jury's award of $14.5 million (in
compensatory damages) is so high that it must be concluded that the
award is based in part on passion resulting from the jury's
evaluation of the outrageous and reprehensible nature of the
conduct of Rock Hudson and defendant (Hudson secretary Mark)
Miller,'' the judge said.
   He added that substantial evidence supported Christian's claim
of enhanced fear of contracting AIDS after he learned that Hudson
had the disease.
   ``On the other hand, however serious plaintiff's distress might
be when he first learned of Hudson's AIDS, such emotional distress
would become somewhat less over time,'' the judge said.
   ``Furthermore, there is no evidence that plaintiff's emotional
distress has been physically debilitating or that plaintiff has
suffered any tangible economic loss.''
   Lawyers for Hudson's estate tried to show during the often lurid
trial testimony that Christian's affair with Hudson was over by the
time the star's disease was discovered. Hudson died at age 58 on
Oct. 5, 1985.
   The jury rejected that argument and decided in February that
Hudson was guilty of ``outrageous conduct'' for concealing his AIDS
diagnosis from Christian, his lover for two years. Christian said
he didn't learn of the star's illness until a few months before
Hudson died.
   The jury awarded Christian $14.5 million compensatory damages
and $7.25 million in punitive damages to compensate for the fear he
suffered.
   ``I thought I was a dead man,'' he testified.
   Although Christian did not contract AIDS and has tested negative
for the virus, the judge and jury found he deserved damages, a
ruling unique in personal injury law on sexually transmitted
diseases. In previous cases, only plaintiffs who developed the
diseases have collected damages.
   Miller, Hudson's secretary, also was found liable for damages.
The jury said he conspired with the actor to keep Christian in the
dark about the AIDS diagnosis so that the younger man would
continue to engage in sex with Hudson. The jury assessed $7.25
million in punitive damages against Miller alone since an estate
cannot be held liable for such damages, which are intended to
punish and set an example.
   In papers filed in recent days, the Hudson estate lawyers had
urged the judge to give Christian no more than $1 million and as
little as $100,000. Lawyers for Miller insisted that Christian is
entitled to no punitive damages.

<TEXT>
   Five men jailed here in connection with
15 alleged drug-cult slayings were indicted Friday by a Mexican
federal judge who said they could serve up to 50 years in prison if
found guilty.
   Only one defendant, Domingo Reyes Bustamante, was eligible for
bond, which Judge Francisco Salvador Perez of the Fourth Federal
Court set at 8 million pesos, or about $3,330.
   Reyes was caretaker at the Santa Elena ranch where authorities
last week found 13 bodies buried. He is accused of ``cover-up'' for
alleged failure to report crimes committed at the ranch 20 miles
west of this border city.
   More serious charges were filed against the other four: Sergio
Martinez Salinas, 23; David Serna Valdez, 22; Elio Hernandez
Rivera, 22; and his nephew, Serafin Hernandez Garcia Jr., 20.
   The four men also are among 11 people indicted by a U.S. federal
grand jury Tuesday in McAllen, Texas, including Serafin Hernandez
Garcia's father, Serafin Hernandez Rivera. The elder Serafin
Hernandez is in custody in Houston.
   The judge said charges that the four face in Mexico are
first-degree murder, kidnapping, violations of federal firearms and
explosives laws, marijuana and cocaine trafficking, violation of
federal burial and exhumation laws, criminal conspiracy and
impersonating federal officials.
   The judge said it probably would take a year to receive
evidence, try the case and assess punishments if the men are found
guilty of crimes including murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking.
   Two more bodies found near the ranch on Sunday also are believed
to be victims of the same drug trafficking organization, officials
have said.
   Many of the victims, all male, were horribly mutilated, with
genitals, hearts, brains and other organs removed in occult
sacrificial rituals designed to bring mystical protection to the
drug ring, according to confessions from some of the defendants.
   The five defendants remained jailed at a detention center in
Matamoros, where guards said the men were unavailable for comment
Friday afternoon.
   Even if found guilty of all the crimes listed, the judge said
that under Mexican law none of the defendants could be sentenced to
more than a total of 50 years in prison.
   ``Never in one single case can one accumulate punishment of more
than 50 years,'' Perez said.
   He said the defendants ``have all their rights and gurantees''
including access to legal representation.
   Authorities in the United States and Mexico, meanwhile,
continued a search for the cult's reported high-priestess, Sara
Aldrete Villarreal, 24, its ``godfather,'' Adolfo de Jesus
Constanzo, 26, and other suspects. Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete were
indicted Tuesday in McAllen.

   A woman who burned as she plunged to her
death was among seven people killed Friday when fire swept through
a four-story apartment building, watched by a man who later
admitted to setting the blaze.
   ``To the best of our knowledge, all of the victims are accounted
for,'' said Assistant State Fire Marshal Paul Gill after
firefighters recovered six bodies from the building which housed a
bar-restaurant and eight apartments.
   James A. Stuckey, 23, was charged with murder after police said
he confessed to starting the early-morning fire. Stuckey told
police he had been depressed ``for quite some time.''
   Firefighters had the blaze under control within a few hours, but
a flare-up and the collapse of part of the roof and the fourth
floor hampered the search for bodies.
   ``It's terrible, I feel sorry for the people who were inside,''
said Vincent Tropea, whose mother owns the 85-year-old building,
which also was heavily damaged in a 1983 fire.
   ``I've been crying all morning,'' Tropea said. ``There's a fire
escape, I guess they just couldn't make it over there.''
   Paulita S. Ilagan, 35, fell or jumped to her death from a
second-story window, Gill said.
   Police officers at the scene said they saw Ilagan standing in
the window and told her to jump. She hesitated, the fire suddenly
engulfed her, and she then plunged from the window aflame, they
said.
   Gill said firefighters recovered the bodies of residents Robert
Jones, 36, Kenneth Godfry, who was in his 40s, and William Hayes,
who was in his 50s. Later Friday they found the bodies of Katherine
Hayes, 69, Nancy Moore, 43, and Jack Pheasant, 53.
   The state medical examiner began performing autopsies on the
bodies Friday afternoon, Gill said.
   One person was injured _ a man who broke both feet jumping out
of the building. He was in fair condition at Fairmont General
Hospital and authorities said he asked them not to release his name.
   Police Chief Edward DeVito said Stuckey is a suspect in at least
one other Fairmont area fire. Marion County Prosecutor Monty Brown
said he was not aware of any prior arrests for Stuckey, who was
jailed without bond.
   In a signed statement, Stuckey said he lighted a matchbook and
dropped it on a hallway carpet inside the brick-and-wood building.
   ``It just went `poof,' everything happened so fast,'' said Bill
Ledsome, 39, who was rescued from a second-floor window. He was
visiting a friend who lived in the building.
   ``The next thing I know there were flames out the back window
and the apartment just filled up with smoke,'' Ledsome said. ``I
kept hollering for my friend but I didn't hear nothing.
   ``I went back into the apartment three times, but it got so bad,
the only thing I could think of was going through the window.
   ``My friend never made it out.''

   Plans are being laid for the 20th
anniversary of the Woodstock festival, but community leaders here
are not excited at the prospect of being included in any
commemoration of peace, love and rock 'n' roll.
   The New York festival in August 1969 came to symbolize the 1960s
for a generation of Americans. But for some people here, 50 miles
north of Chicago, Woodstock evokes thoughts of trouble.
   ``This is a small, mid-Victorian town that's trying to stay that
way,'' said Mayor Jim Shoemaker.
   ``We've had a lot of events where there was a good-sized number
of people but they were ones that we planned, ones the town
wanted,'' he said Thursday night.
   ``We don't go too much for these pre-packaged things were they
add water, mix it up and serve it to you.''
   WCKG-FM, a Chicago radio station that plays classic rock, has
hired a company to plan a two-day anniversay festival, one of
several planned around the country.
   The McHenry County Fairgrounds, part of which lies in Woodstock,
population 15,000, is one of eight sites being considered for the
WCKG event, said Tom Drilias, vice president of Festival Events,
Inc.
   Organizers hope to attract 25,000 people to hear singers on
three stages perform folk and rock music of the late 1960s. There
would be arts and crafts displays, carnival rides, food booths and
beer tents.
   The original three-day peace and love fest, held on a farm near
Woodstock in upstate New York, drew some 300,000 people who swayed
to the sounds of Jimi Hendrix, Joan Baez, Sly and the Family Stone,
The Who and others.
   The event was plagued by heavy rain, lack of food and sanitation
facilities, drug overdoses and massive traffic jams.
   ``I think it's the memory of 20 years ago that makes people say
`we don't want that here,''' Shoemaker said.
   Some local merchants, however, would welcome the visitors.
   ``Being a small carry-out, the business would be appreciated,''
said Kathy Dugas, who owns Ma Bill's Snack Spot on the town square.
   To hold such an event, organizers would be required to get
permits from the county.
   ``I don't think they've got too much of a chance,'' Shoemaker
said.

   A winery worker was arraigned on
murder charges Friday stemming from a bloodbath ``so bizarre, so
incomprehensible'' that the county public defender said he believed
a brain disorder might explain the crimes.
   A glum, unshaven, shackled Ramon Salcido, wearing an orange jail
jumpsuit, was charged with seven counts of murder and three counts
of attempted murder in the April 14 killing spree. Prosecutors said
they would seek the death penalty.
   His court appearance came a day after an enraged mob greeted his
arrival from Mexico with shouts of ``Kill him'' and picket signs
supporting capital punishment.
   Salcido delayed entering a plea and was ordered back to court
May 5. He was returned to Sonoma County Jail, where he will remain
under heavy guard and a suicide watch.
   Judge Knoel Owen granted the prosecution's request for a gag
order on lawyers involved in the case. The order bars officials
from talking about the case with the exception of referring without
comment to public records.
   Before the order issued, Sonoma County District Attorney Gene
Tunney said prosecutors would seek the death penalty. He discounted
speculation that Salcido's alleged rampage was fueled in part by a
two-day binge on alcohol and cocaine.
   He also said he believed Salcido is legally sane. ``The final
decision about his state of mind will be made in court,'' he said.
``Those (the slayings) were not the acts of an irrational
berserker.''
   Sonoma County Chief Public Defender Marteen Miller said he will
have Salcido undergo psychiatric and neurological tests. ``I expect
to find some brain lesion or tumor,'' he said, calling the crimes
``so bizarre, so incomprehensible.''
   ``God, I hope I find something,'' Miller said.
   Miller said the cost of the trial would be $3 million to $4
million and said he would seek a change of venue to Orange, San
Diego or Los Angeles county.
   A widespread manhunt that began after the killings Friday and
Saturday ended Wednesday when Salcido was arrested in western
Mexico near his hometown of Los Mochis. He was brought to Mexico
City on Thursday afternoon, deported by Mexico and returned to
California.
   The 28-year-old forklift driver was whisked into the county jail
Thursday night, smiling slightly as 200 people waiting outside
shouted ``Kill him!'' Inside, he was kept under a suicide watch,
officials said.
   Signs reading ``Yes on capital punishment'' and ``Salcido
doesn't deserve to live'' greeted him upon his return at Sonoma
County Airport.
   ``I want to see him tortured. I think he deserves it, what he
did to those kids,'' Douglas Drake, 28, of Santa Rosa said Friday,
adding that he thought it would be appropriate to skin Salcido
alive.
   Shawn Kennedy, 19, the mother of two young children, said
Salcido doesn't deserve a trial and added that she would pull the
switch on the electric chair. ``I wouldn't even hesitate if they
asked me to do that,'' she said.
   Sheriff's officials said Salcido was held in a maximum-security
cell, isolated from other inmates.
   ``With this type of prisoner, you have a threat from other
inmates,'' said reserve sheriff's Deputy John Childers.
   Salcido told Mexican television reporters and law enforcement
agents he killed his American-born wife, Angela, 24, and a winery
co-worker, Tracy Toovey, in a jealous rage, believing Toovey and
his wife were romantically involved, according to federal officials.
   ``It's ludicrous,'' said the Rev. Rich Gantenbein, a family
friend who led a memorial service for Toovey. ``Ramon has created
his own hell and now he's trying to drag everyone into it.''
   Also killed in a brutal shooting and slashing spree were
Salcido's mother-in-law, his two sisters-in-law and two of his
young daughters. The two sisters-in-law, 8 and 12, also were raped
and sodomized, and one was nearly decapitated.
   His daughter Carmina, who turns 3 on Monday, is recovering from
a slashed throat. She and the bodies of her sisters, 1 and 4, were
found Saturday at a Sonoma County dump. Carmina identified her
father as their attacker, authorities said.
   Additional murder charges will depend on whether lab tests show
that Salcido was at the home of his mother-in-law and her young
children when they died, Tunney said.

<HEAD>Eastern Scraps Botched Shuttle Marketing Effort With Cabbies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strike-ravaged Eastern Airlines on Friday
dropped a program of rewarding New York taxicab drivers for
steering passengers toward its Northeast shuttle service at
LaGuardia Airport.
   The incentive campaign, which started about two weeks ago, was
stopped after New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission told Eastern
it was ``against all rules.''
   Ellen Weiman, a spokeswoman for the commission, said taxi
drivers shouldn't be induced to take riders where they don't want
to go.
   ``Once it was brought to our attention, it was discontinued,''
said Jim Ashlock, an Eastern spokesman in Miami.
   Eastern was giving cabbies a $25 American Express certificate
for every five loads of passengers they dropped off at Eastern's
shuttle terminal at LaGuardia.
   There was also a weekly drawing for participating taxi drivers
for a color television set, videocassette recorder or radio.
   ``We'd like to think that maybe the cabbies are doing some
selling for us,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said earlier
Friday. He noted that around half the passengers coming to
LaGuardia arrive by taxi.
   Eastern's hourly shuttle linking New York with Boston and
Washington has been running a normal schedule, compared with only
10 percent of pre-strike flights for the airline as a whole.
Passenger loads have been decimated, however, as the rival shuttle
operated by Pan Am Corp. has eaten into Eastern's traffic.
   Pan Am once used an incentive plan to encourage cabbies to pick
up arriving passengers at its New York terminal when the airline
started a shuttle service in late 1986, spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon
said, but the program wasn't illegal.
   She said the airline has captured around 80 percent of the
Northeast shuttle market, and Eastern's taxi program appears to
have had no impact.
   In another development, a Washington property developer
confirmed through an associate Friday that he is interested in
buying Eastern.
   ``We've expressed our interest; it's sincere and we're pursuing
it,'' said John Sarpa, senior vice president of Hadid Development
Co. in Roslyn, Va. The company is run by Mohamed Hadid, who
recently agreed to buy the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Washington and
New York.
   Attorneys for Eastern and its striking unions recently said
there are four serious offers for the airline, which has been
grounded by a walkout since March 4. It filed for bankruptcy
protection five days later.
   They said the bidders are ex-baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth, whose $464 million deal to buy Eastern collapsed last
week; takeover strategist Carl Icahn; billionaire hotel executive
Jay Pritzker; and an unnamed suitor.
   But Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent's Texas Air Corp.,
insisted earlier this week that Eastern isn't for sale and that
there is no serious fourth bidder.

   About 10,000 gallons of oil-tainted
water spilled Friday into a stream feeding the lush Atchafalaya
Basin as a barge was being unloaded at a waste disposal site,
authorities said.
   The barge, carrying 900,000 gallons of wastewater from an Exxon
plant in Houston, buckled in the middle after an estimated 280,000
gallons had been siphoned into tanker trucks, said spokesman Bobby
Mayweather of GSX Land Treatment of White Castle.
   ``It looked like a giant had stepped on the barge smack in the
middle,'' said state police Lt. Ronnie Jones.
   State police originally estimated the spill at up to 400,000
gallons, while GSX said their estimate was 180,000. Exxon
spokeswoman Jill Johnson in Dallas later downgraded the spill to
about 10,000 gallons.
   No one was injured in the accident, but Ms. Johnson said a small
number of fish were killed at the outset. The waste, according to
Exxon, was 90 percent water, 7 percent alcohol and 3 percent light
oil, said Jones.
   The spill occurred at a remote area about 35 miles southwest of
Baton Rouge on the edge of the Atchafalaya Basin, a vast hardwood
swamp and marshland that is a breeding ground for a variety of fish
and wildlife.
   Iberville Parish Sheriff Freddie Pitre said he believed the
tanker truck crew had siphoned the waste from the front and rear
ends of the 300-foot-long barge, leaving most of the weight in the
middle.
   ``Oil-absorbing booms were in place shortly after the spill and
we believe most of the waste was confined to the immediate area of
Grand River,'' said Jones. ``We may not know tomorrow or even the
next day if we got it all because there is no visible slick.''
   Some of the waste could find its way into the basin, but the
spill is no disaster, said Jones.
   ``Things could have been an awful lot worse but because of the
waste involved and the quick response by Iberville Parish
officials, we've got a good handle on the situation,'' he said.
   Paul Dubois, a spokesman for the Palmer Co., owner of the barge,
said the waste is commonly known in the oil industry as slop water,
used to wash out tanks and ships. When it's dirty with oil residue,
it becomes waste water, he said.
   GSX was paid by Exxon to treat the non-hazardous waste and
dispose of it in the company's land farm operation, Mayweather said.
   The barge was leased by GSX, and Exxon had no responsibility for
the barge after it left the Texas site, said Pitre.

   The damaged battleship USS Iowa steamed home
from Puerto Rico on Friday while investigators on board interviewed
crewmen and reviewed an amateur videotape of the explosion that
killed 47 sailors.
   Ens. Karl Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said the Navy
would not release the exact position of the ship, which was
expected to reach its home port here about 5:30 p.m. Sunday.
   The Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions that
crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the
explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below
suffocated when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces.
   Navy investigators also said the explosion left two fully loaded
gun barrels in the turret, the newspaper reported.
   The explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded
and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire
the center gun, the newspaper said.
   After the fire was extinguished, crew men worked quickly to
remove the shells and powder from the other two guns before they
could explode, the newspaper said.
   Meanwhile, NBC News reported that the exact cause of the blast
in one of the ship's three 16-inch gun turrets on Wednesday may
never be known because the destruction inside the turret was so
complete.
   The Navy released photographs of the firefighting effort, which
authorities said required two hours to put out the blaze and cool
off the turret before anyone could enter it.
   During the trip home, investigators on board were reviewing a
videotape of the turret taken by an Iowa officer who had wanted to
record the firing of the big guns when the explosion occurred, said
Lt. Cmdr. James Cudler, a Pentagon spokesman. He said the
investigators had not decided whether to release the tape to the
public. Investigators were also interviewing crew members.
   Maj. Tom Johnston, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet in
Norfolk, said he had no information on the cause of death of the 47
crewmen.Navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of
the explosion.
   In Norfolk, memorial services for the 47 victims are tentatively
set for 9 a.m. Monday. President George Bush is to attend.
   Johnson said the ship is steaming under its own power, and
repeated the Navy's daily report that the ship is seaworthy and in
no danger.
   The 887-foot, 58,000-ton battleship has armor up to 17{ inches
thick. Navy officials have said that the explosion in the No. 2 gun
turret damaged only the turret.
   The top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee said
Friday the panel will hold hearings on the fiery explosion.
   The explosion occurred during open seas gun practice 300 miles
north of Puerto Rico. The Pentagon said the blast ripped through
the middle gun of the three-gun turret, and that that gun had not
been fired prior to the explosion.
   The Pentagon has ordered that no 16-inch gun will be fired until
the investigation is complete. Ships with those guns _ the
battleships Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri and Wisconsin _ were built
during World War II. Some critics have said the 16-inch guns are
outmoded and dangerous.

   Former President Reagan will make his first
overseas visit since leaving the White House when he goes to Japan
in October to address business and political leaders.
   The trip, announced Thursday by the Fujisankei Communications
Group, will mark the first time a former president has spoken
before the Fujisankei forum.
   Although details about the trip were not released, Fujisankei
said in a statement that Reagan will meet with Japanese leaders
during the trip.
   ``We have many fond memories of our visits to Japan and look
forward to being back among our friends during our trip this coming
fall,'' the Fujisankei statement quoted Reagan as saying.
   Hiroaki Shikanai, joint chairman and chief executive officer of
Fujisankei, said the corporation first invited Reagan to speak at
its forum in 1983 and repeated the offer at a White House dinner in
January.
   ``Mr. Reagan is well-known and admired for his charm and sense
of humor, even in difficult times of stress,'' Shikanai said.
   The Fujisankei Communications Group includes the Fuji Television
Network and the Sankei Shimbun newspaper chain.

   The mother of a blind child who brought a
teddy bear stuffed with drug paraphernalia to school pleaded
innocent Thursday to a charge of child endangerment.
   Alicia Mae Tapia, 42, was ordered back to San Leandro-Hayward
Municipal Court on May 11 for further proceedings on the
misdemeanor charge, the Alameda County District Attorney's office
said.
   Her 8-year-old daughter, blind since birth, brought the teddy
bear called ``Ticklebear'' to show her classmates at Castro Valley
Elementary School. It was part of a school event called ``Share
Day.''
   The girl, who attends a class for the visually impaired, told
teacher's aide Diane Oxford that Ticklebear used to laugh when
hugged, but that the battery-operated voice box inside no longer
worked, a sheriff's report said.
   Oxford told sheriff's deputies she unzipped the brown teddy's
back to see what was wrong, and pulled out a bag with a syringe, a
broken plunger, a bottle cap fashioned into a drug cooker, and the
residue of an unknown drug.
   The aide took the bear to the principal, who called deputies.
   Sheriff's Sgt. Dale Toussaint said the girl told Oxford that the
items belonged to her mother.
   The girl and her 6-year-old brother matter-of-factly described
terms used by drug users and how the ``medicine'' is injected in
arms, Toussaint said. The boy said both his parents used drugs in
the home, the deputy said.
   The children were taken into protective custody and Tapia was
booked in lieu of $10,000 bail.
   Toussaint said a search of the Tapia home produced another teddy
bear whose zippered compartment contained part of a syringe.
   After her arrest she told officers she didn't know the materials
were in the bear, hidden there by her estranged husband. Toussaint
quoted the woman as saying she was trying to kick a 25-year habit.

   School officials across the country are being
advised to test for radon after the federal government found
unhealthy levels of the odorless, cancer-causing gas in half the
schools examined in spot checks from Maine to Washington state.
   ``Based on measurements taken in 3,000 schoolrooms in 16 states,
it appears that elevated levels of radon gas can be found in
schools throughout the United States,'' EPA Administrator William
K. Reilly said Thursday.
   He called indoor radon, which is emitted from natural
radioactive decay in the ground, ``one of the major environmental
health threats facing Americans'' and urged that officials
nationwide test their schoolrooms for the gas.
   The EPA, which last year issued a similar warning to homeowners
after a spot check around the country, said that of 130 public
schools tested in 41 communities, 54 percent of the schools had at
least one room normally occupied by students or staff that
registered unhealthy levels of radon.

   Insect parts, rodent hairs and maggots don't
sound appetizing, but when tossed with a salad, churned up in
tomato sauce or baked in bread they're not bad at all, the
government says.
   The Food and Drug Administration says that though vermin and
their residues are ``aesthetically unpleasing,'' within prescribed
limits they are ``harmless, natural and unavoidable'' in food.
   Under FDA standards, for example, 3.5 ounces of tomato sauce can
have up to 30 fly eggs, 11 ounces of wheat flour can have up to 450
insect fragments and a half pound of canned or frozen spinach can
have as many as 100 aphids, and a pound of cocoa beans can contain
up to 10 milligrams of rodent feces.
   These limits are in the FDA's manual of ``food defect action
levels.''

   Corporate takeover artist T. Boone Pickens has
raided Japan, leaving business leaders suspicious and wondering
whether Americans like him want to buy their companies just as the
Japanese have done in the United States.
   However, the difficulties the Texas oilman has encountered with
the subtleties and intricities of Japanese business suggest Pickens
himself is far from being a threat to Japan's leading companies.
   Pickens has purchased shares worth about $1 billion in Koito
Manufacturing Co., a major auto parts maker, surpassing Toyota
Motor to become the largest shareholder. But despite owning 20.2
percent of Koito, its management politely turned down Pickens'
request this week for a seat on the board of directors.
   ``It is necessary to build a trusting relationship first. In
Japan, it is not possible to just say, `I'm a major shareholder'
and get a seat on the board right away,'' Koito director Tamotsu
Aoyama told a news conference Thursday.

<HEAD>Acid Rain Is Winning the Modern Battle of Gettysburg</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID MORRIS</BYLINE>

   The North and South both are losing the
modern-day Battle of Gettysburg.
   The monuments that make the rolling hills one of the world's
largest outdoor museums are melting. Every time rain drips from the
marble and bronze memorials, acid slowly but steadily washes away
pieces of history.
   ``The marble ones are definitely on their way to destruction,''
said David Ballard, maintenance director at Gettysburg National
Military Park. ``You can wax bronze, but there isn't a ... lot you
can do about marble. The marble's just going to keep on fizzing
away.''
   Only granite markers and monument bases seem immune. Across the
sprawling battlefield, the effects of acid rain are obvious to even
a casual observer. Brass plaques are stained and streaked with
corrosion in shades of black, gray, green and white. Marble markers
are badly pitted and misshapen.
   On Cemetery Ridge, the high ground that Union forces held on the
decisive third day of the 1863 Civil War battle, Ballard gestured
helplessly toward an octagonal marble marker. Inscriptions had been
chiseled on all eight sides, but only a stray letter or two remain
visibile.
   ``Whatever the heck was here, it's gone now. It's history,'' he
said.
   A short hike away, in the cemetery where Abraham Lincoln
delivered the Gettysburg Address is the first monument erected
here. The Soldiers' National Monument, whose dedication took up
much of the front page of The New York Times on July 2, 1869, is
``probably the most endangered piece we have in the park right
now,'' Ballard said.
   The monument features a woman representing liberty atop a
classical column, which rests on a pedestal. At the four corners of
the pedestal, sculpted marble figures represent War, History, Peace
and Plenty. Damage from acid particles in rain isn't apparent at
first because of the stark beauty of the work viewed as a whole. A
closer look reveals a missing toe here, a washed-out detail there.
   Ballard likened the damage to a melting ice cube, which retains
its general appearance for a while, then collapses because it loses
structural shape.
   Fighting the acidic effects of airborne pollution, according to
a draft National Park Service report, is a losing battle:
   ``Only memories last forever. In time, metal corrodes and stone
crumbles. What worries park managers at Gettysburg National
Military Park is the speed with which our monuments to those
honored dead are disappearing.''
   Complicating Ballard's mission are two facts he can't control.
Pennsylvania, according to the state Sierra Club and Pennsylvanians
for Acid Rain Control, receives the most acidic rainfall in the
United States and is one of the top three sources of sulfur
dioxide. Environmentalists contend sulfur dioxide from coal-fired
power plants is a major cause of acid rain.
   Another constraint Ballard faces is limited government funding,
both to deal with acid rain and maintain Gettysburg's monuments.
   Asked if his crews could protect the 1,300 monuments and major
markers, he replied, ``Not given the current state of funding in
the park service. It would take a crew of a dozen people, perhaps,
working year round.'' Payroll costs alone would total $300,000, he
said.
   Park workers do what they can. Corrosion is removed from bronze
with a pressurized stream of pulverized walnut shells the
consistency of pepper; then it is coated with a protective wax. To
be effective, the coating should be done every year, but funds and
manpower dictate less frequent treatments here.
   The work isn't cheap. Simply erecting scaffolding to repair
acid-rain damage to the Pennsylvania Monument, the largest in the
park, cost $8,000. It cost $2,900 total to clean and wax a smaller
Minnesota monument.
   Environmentalists say the problem can be resolved by requiring
industries to install equipment to reduce and control emissions.
   ``We have the technological means,'' the Canadian Coalition on
Acid Rain said recently. ``We know what we have to do to clean our
air and we know how to do it ... We've studied enough, we've
gathered tons of scientific evidence and we've talked until we're
blue in the face.''
   At recent conference, A. Joseph Dowd of the American Electric
Power Service Corp. said Congress shouldn't require industries to
spend billions on pollution control devices ``unless it is quite
clear that the resulting environmental benefits in the Northeast
and Canada will exceed the cost.''
   Ballard has steered clear of the political battle over acid
rain, but says something must be done before long or major
monuments will be beyond repair. ``It's a real problem, and the
current solutions just aren't good enough.''

<HEAD>Disagreement Stirs Negative Energy In Spiritualist Enclave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CASSADAGA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a tiny eight-sided hut, spiritual
healer Gladys Reid turns on a cassette of soothing melodies. With a
brush of her hand, she claims to whisk away tension and negative
energy.
   It won't be so easy to rid Cassadaga of its woes, say many
residents of the backwoods enclave of more than 100 Spiritualists
who attest to psychic or prophetic powers and the ability to
communicate with the deceased.
   The friction of controversy and fear of change cling to this
95-year-old community like the Spanish moss draping from the tree
limbs. In the ephemeral realm of Spiritualism, very material issues
such as politics, stock ownership and lawsuits jangle the village's
almost surreal tranquillity.
   ``If you look close you can feel the tension in the air,'' said
Ron E. Heriff, a professional medium who was among a five-candidate
slate that lost a bitter campaign March 25 to control the
non-profit board that runs Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp, which
governs most psychic practitioners in town.
   At least three of the five have been threatened with loss of
their single share of camp stock for their alleged dissident acts,
and a legal challenge in Volusia Circuit Court is expected to be
heard sometime this spring on a plan that turned the camp from a
shareholder to membership group.
   Leaders say the move was to protect against unqualified psychics
using the camp's name. Others claim it was an attempt to stifle new
ideas and force non-conformists from low-cost camp homes.
   Meanwhile, at the newly reopened Cassadaga Hotel _ a musty,
quaint 62-year-old structure _ owner Joseph Stupar has filed suit
against the camp board alleging harassment because he rents space
to some of the two dozen Spiritualists who operate outside the
camp's sanction.
   ``All this bickering and lawsuits have drained the positive
energy from this place,'' said Marilyn Awtry-Smith, who lost her
camp stock in December for forming a rival group in 1986.
   ``The tension is very, very high,'' Heriff said. ``I'm not
joking, we may be witnessing the undoing of Cassadaga.''
   Premonitions are just one ingredient in the metaphysical montage
of Cassadaga. There are those who acknowledge the healing powers of
certain stones and crystals. Others comb the Zodiac for insights
and guidance. Auras are read and past lives are examined.
   But the basic tenet of Spiritualism remains the ability to speak
with the ``so-called dead.'' The contact with the spirit side is
critical to demonstrate that death is not the end; the messages
from the afterlife can be anything from a subtle feeling to words
scripted through the air by light-emitting trumpets.
   ``Look at it this way,'' said medium and board member Darleen
Misskelley. ``You can't see television or radio waves in the air,
but you see an image or hear a voice on the radio. Well, a medium
is just like a television or radio. We pick up the higher
vibrations from the spirit side and translate it back to something
we can understand.''
   Cassadaga is a mecca for mediums. Signs hang from most of the
wood-frame houses offering different doors into the spirit world:
Psychic Counselors, Past-life Regressions, Astral Therapy. On Gala
Days and Medium's Nights during the year, the compound is abuzz
with visitors seeking 15-minute seances.
   Yet not all in the village are believers. One camp shareholder
rents to her sons, who playfully erected a ``Ghostbusters'' movie
logo.
   ``We're not a circus or a sideshow,'' said Misskelley, the
daughter of a Presbyterian deacon. ``But some people can't
appreciate that. Everyone mocked Nancy Reagan for seeking the
advice of an astrologer when they know nothing about it.''
   The foundations of Spiritualism in America began after the
Revolution, when metaphysics and superstition often intertwined
with everyday life. One of the largest communities, now known as
Lily Dale, was established in southwestern New York in 1879. At the
same time, George Colby was homesteading here to establish a winter
retreat for the northern Cassadaga village.
   None of Colby's descendants are alive and vandals have burned
and damaged his cabin. Yet his portrait is displayed like an icon.
There are also numerous pictures of Jesus, whom Spiritualists
regard as just one of the great healers and mediums. Followers are
hunting for suitable pictures of other prophets, including Mohammed
and Buddha.
   Today, all members of the camp compound must be approved by the
board. About a third of the 300 shareholders live in Cassadaga,
where home prices are kept low _ most are less than $50,000 _ and
some of the long-time residents pay only $5 a year for a lease.
Most make their living off readings, averaging about $35 per
session.
   But in a community of avowed free-thinkers, it's different ideas
and approaches that have caused the rifts.
   Camp leaders are worried that non-affilated readers and mediums
operating at the hotel and on county land across the street will
turn the town into a carnival and soil its repuation. The outsiders
say there should be no constraints on what is practiced in town.
   ``It's just growing pains,'' said Bonnie Bemis, who holds weekly
services at the Universal Spiritualist Center across the street.
``It's like a pot-bound plant straining to grow and flourish. Put
us all in the same room and we believe the same thing.
   ``There are just some people who are resistant to change.''
   Astrologist Hanan Leeds, who carries a 50-year-old hand-painted
Zodiac wheel in the rear of his car, said, ``There's no reason to
fight. There's enough energy here to go around.''

<HEAD>Ski Area, Hikers Fight Over Potential Trail Development</HEAD>

   Northbound end-to-enders on the
Appalachian Trail follow the Green Mountains about a third of the
way up Vermont before turning east for the last leg into New
Hampshire and Maine.
   But just south of that turn at Sherburne Pass, there's a fight
in the hills, between hikers looking for wilderness serenity and
the East's biggest ski area, citing property rights as it looks to
develop another mountain.
   The fight is over a federal law designed to provide a 2,140-mile
corridor of wilderness for the footpath from Georgia to Maine. At
issue is a deal struck by the National Park Service with Killington
Ski Area, the six-mountain resort in south-central Vermont, for a
section of trail that crosses Killington land.
   The Appalachian Trail Conference, Green Mountain Club and other
environmental groups say the Park Service failed to take a tough
enough anti-development stance in the talks that led to the
agreement with Killington.
   If Killington proceeds with the three ski trails, one lift and
associated buildings and other development allowed in the
agreement, hiking the trail will be ``more like walking through an
amusement park'' than a pristine wilderness, said James Dumont, a
lawyer for the trail groups.
   ``The agreement that has been executed in the opinion of the
Park Service is in keeping with the trail legislation,'' said Chuck
Rinaldi, project manager at the Park Service's Appalachian Trail
office in Harpers Ferry, W.Va.
   For the Park Service to have protected the trail to the extent
sought by environmental groups, Rinaldi said, ``would have required
condemnation and the Park Service wasn't prepared to take that
step.''
   All three members of Vermont's congressional delegation have
asked the Park Service and Interior Department to reconsider, and
trail advocates say they're prepared to go to court to push for a
tougher interpretation of the law.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who wrote to Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan in early March asking for a review of the deal, wrote
again last week. ``I remain concerned that the best professional
judgment of Park Service trail managers was ignored during easement
negotiations,'' he said, and warned that he was ``prepared to
proceed legislatively if necessary.''
   The controversy is being watched closely up and down the trail
because the Park Service is getting ready to negotiate agreements
with at least three other ski areas: the Pico ski area adjacent to
Killington, Dartmouth College Skiway in New Hampshire, and the
Saddleback ski resort in Maine.
   Trail advocates say if the Killington agreement is a model,
their goal of a 1,000-foot-wide corridor to provide a wilderness
environment will be lost.
   ``This sets just a horrible precedent,'' said Kevin Peterson,
New England representative for the Appalachian Trail Conference.
   Rinaldi acknowledged that the law's intent was ``to try to
create a sense of remoteness for the hiker,'' but said ``some
people in the Park Service feel that it's acceptable'' for ski
trails to intersect the Appalachian Trail.
   Trail advocates say they believe the Park Service took a weaker
negotiating stance with Killington than other landowners. The
Conservation Law Foundation has filed a Freedom of Information Act
request seeking documents describing how the deal was struck and
how agreements with other landowners were reached.
   Killington Vice President Carl Spangler said it was good legal
research, not a double standard, that allowed the resort to keep
more development rights than other landowners. In fact, he said,
the Park Service has ``overstepped its bounds'' with the other
property owners.
   Killington hired a Washington law firm that dug into the
legislative history of the 1968 National Trail Systems Act and
found evidence that Congress had not intended to block ski area
development, Spangler said.
   ``I think the Park Service was taken a little bit off guard. I
don't think they had seen this kind of presentation before.''
   Among the material the lawyers found were excerpts from Senate
debate in which backers of the legislation assured Sen. George
Aiken, R-Vt., that the rights of ski areas would be, in Aiken's
words, ``fully protected.''
   Both sides also cite the trail act itself in saying that, ``in
selecting rights-of-way full consideration shall be given to
minimizing the adverse effects upon the adjacent landowner or user
and his operation.''
   But they differ on whether that applies to development that is
merely in the planning stages as well as that which is already in
place.
   Killington and trail advocates agreed years ago to reroute the
trail along the western ridge line of the Green Mountains, to an
area Killington hasn't yet developed. But Spangler said the resort
wants to maintain its right to develop the land, and that when
negotiations began with the government, the resort had already
mapped, surveyed, flagged and taken to a state environmental panel
plans for a cross-country ski trail crossing the trail corridor.

   Cracking down too hard on tanker captain Joseph
Hazelwood and others like him who drink and drive trains, steer
ships or fly planes could backfire and produce closet abusers, say
experts in the rehabilitation field.
   Alcohol and drug abusers can be cured, but they will cover up
their problem if they are forbidden to work at their old jobs,
professionals said.
   ``When people know they will not be returned to their job if
they do the right thing, they'll do the wrong thing. They won't get
help,'' said James Wrich, who ran the pilots' rehabilitation
program for United Air Lines for six years.
   ``Either you have recovering alcoholics or practicing
alcoholics,'' Wrich said. ``Alcoholism exists in nuclear plants,
operating rooms and the airline and shipping industries. You either
help them recover or they'll cover it up.''
   The issue of pilots who hit the bottle before they hit the
throttle resurfaced after the March 24 wreck of the Exxon Valdez in
Alaska. The resulting oil spill was the worst in North America, and
the tanker captain was known by his employers to have a drinking
problem.
   Since the wreck, the Exxon Corp. _ denounced around the world
for an environmental disaster _ has taken a hard line on alcoholics.
   Exxon now says abusers of alcohol and drugs will be barred from
piloting a ship, flying a company plane or operating a refinery
even after treatment. They will be reassigned to less critical jobs.
   ``Even with close followup, there are certain things you can't
have people do,'' Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl told a U.S. House
committee. He told Fortune magazine it was ``bad judgment'' to
allow a captain with a drinking problem to command a tanker.
   ``A very unfortunate thing happened,'' said Larry Stockman, who
runs Exxon's employee health assistance program and defends the
company line. ``They've got to seek some kind of measure so it
never happens again.''
   But Exxon's new policy, which also mandates random testing,
ignited a firestorm. Some felt it was Exxon's way of reacting to
charges it mishandled the cleanup.
   ``They're trying to cover-up their own guilt by blaming the
victim,'' said Loren Siegel of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``This is the jerk of a knee. They're sending a message to
people with problems not to come foward,'' said Paul Samuels of the
Legal Action Center, a New York-based defender of individual
rights. ``From a legal point of view, they're wandering into
unchartered waters.''
   But Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Anderson of the Coast Guard said of Exxon's
decision: ``Can you blame them?''
   Hazelwood, captain of the Exxon Valdez, lost his New York
driver's license in 1984 when he refused to take a breathalyzer
test and later pleaded guilty to drunken driving. He was also
convicted of drunken driving in New Hampshire last September.
   While he couldn't steer a car on land, Hazelwood's license to
pilot supertankers at sea was never taken away. It was renewed for
five years in 1986.
   Hazelwood had turned over the helm to an unqualified third mate
when the wandering ship rammed Bligh Reef and dirtied Prince
William Sound with more than 10 million gallons of oil. Nine hours
after the accident, he was found legally drunk under Coast Guard
standards on blood alcohol content that took effect last year.
   New standards that require testing for drugs and alcohol after
accidents at sea are being phased in this summer.
   Atlantic Richfield Co., which also transports Alaskan oil, has
ordered all crews to take breathalyzer tests before sailing. The
program begins in August for a 10-tanker fleet.
   Under a 1985 law, railroad employees are the only non-government
people in the transportation industry who must undergo federally
mandated testing for drugs and alcohol after an accident.
   Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality
of the tests.
   Eight to 10 percent of the U.S. workforce has a problem with
drug or alcohol abuse or both, according to Thomas Delaney,
executive director of the Association of Labor-Management
Administrators and Consultants on Alcoholism.
   One program viewed as a model for treatment covers the Air Line
Pilots Association. Since 1973, more than 900 pilots have completed
long-term rehabilitation and are flying again, a success rate of 93
percent, ALPA said.
   ``An alcoholism program that doesn't returd
pilot to the cockpit is only marginally more successful that the
old approach of, `If we catn a rehabilitatech you, we'll fire you,''' said
spokesman John Mazor.
   The Exxon Valdez accident is not isolated.
   _On Jan. 4, 1987, a speeding Conrail freight locomotive ran a
stop signal and collided with an Amtrak train near Baltimore,
killing 16 passengers and injuring 170 people in the worst accident
in Amtrak history.
   The Conrail engineer, Richard L. Gates, was an admitted
alcoholic and tested positive for marijuana after the crash. He was
arrested for drunken driving a month before the train wreck and had
been convicted eight times of speeding in his car.
   _On May 11, 1988, engineer Raymond Hunter was killed when his
commuter train rammed an empty train in New York City. Hunter
tested positive for pot, federal f the
National Transportation Safety Board.
   The federal Department of Transportation has new regulations
that will test airline pilots, bus and truck drivers, subway and
commuter train engineers and pipeline transport workers. The first
tests won't come until December.
   No one in private industry or the government is known to test
job applicants for alcoholism. It requires a blood sample, which is
more invasive than a urine test, officials said.
   In the private sector, 43 percent of the nation's largest firms,
including IBM, AT&amp;T and 3M, have drug-screening tests for job
applicants or employees.
   The proliferation of testing raises legal questions, however.
   ``We view pre-employment screening and random testing as
violations of employees' privacy rights. What it does is monitor
people's off-duty activities,'' said the ACLU's Siegel.
   But consumers say it's not too much to expect sobriety.
   ``You may be able to show me a guy who's a drunk driver and a
great airline pilot, tanker captain or railroad engineer, but I
don't want to ride with him,'' said Ross Capon of the National
Association of Rail Passengers.

<TEXT>
   Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Fanshawe started
at the Royal College of Music the same year. Now they're the two
best-known composers from their class.
   Neither is writing traditional, or even avant-garde, classical
music. Lloyd Webber writes musicals which are hits in London and on
Broadway. What Fanshawe is up to _ going by boat and canoe to
hundreds of islands in Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia _ will
be revealed on the first two episodes of this season's
``Adventure'' on PBS.
   Fanshawe will be seen, wearing shorts plus a cap blessed by a
witchdoctor, his face alight with childlike eagerness, a tape
recorder hanging over his shoulder, a microphone in each hand,
recording traditional music.
   Tonight's show is titled ``Pacific Journey: Adventures of a
Musical Mariner, Papua New Guinea.'' A week later, the location is
Tahiti and the Easter Islands.
   An Australian woman who learned what Fanshawe was doing asked if
her film crew could follow him around as he recorded music in
remote places. He said yes; she got a bank loan, and a crew
followed him, off and on, for 18 months in 1985 and '86.
   The soundtrack from the two ``Adventure'' shows is released by
Mercury Records as ``Musical Mariner: Pacific Journey.''
   Fanshawe says, ``I think it's the first time authentic music of
these places is heard on a commercial record. There's 18 minutes of
my own music which serves to link the travels.'' One piece is
``Solomon Island Pan Pipes _ the Awakening,'' an intermezzo for
cello and piano.
   Fanshawe says, ``I've carved a niche for myself which I believe
to be unique. There is no composer who does what I do.''
   In 1973, Fanshawe, a Protestant, composed ``African Sanctus,'' a
Latin Mass in harmony with field recordings collected over four
years traveling in East Africa. When it's performed, which it is
often, it's by recording, orchestra and chorus.
   Fanshawe will compose again this time, using orchestra, four
soloists, two choruses and his carefully cataloged Pacific
recordings. He recorded Hurricane Oscar in Fiji, and that'll be
included in ``Pacific Odyssey.''
   In his childhood in Devon, England, Fanshawe, now 47, recalls,
``I wanted to be an explorer. I dreamed of going to Africa.'' He
came from three generations of British army men, stationed in India.
   He also was composing, putting himself to sleep nightly singing
music he'd invented. At 17, a baroness, whose sons were at the same
school, heard Fanshawe playing Fats Waller jazz on a piano. She
stuck her head in a window and said, ``You're very musical but you
have no technique.'' She offered piano lessons, which he took for
four years, paying for them by modeling for the Canterbury Art
School.
   From 1965 through '69, he attended the Royal College of Music
six months a year and the other six months hitchhiked. He says, ``I
rode camels with Arabs in Saudi Arabia, traveled through the
Euphrates, Iraq and Iran. People were very hospitable. I lived on
bread, nothing nutritious. I didn't steal. I think I spent less
than 20 pounds in six months.''
   He has been called a nut, Fanshawe says. ``I have not fitted in.
Would you consider with what I've achieved in my life that I'm a
person who's a nut case? But I am obsessed, totally dedicated to
what I do.''
   A turning point for Fanshawe was hearing pearl divers sing in
Bahrain in 1967. ``It was more than beautiful. It was guttural. It
was of the earth.
   ``It was the work chants of these pearl divers that made me rush
back to England and come back with a tape recorder, a cassette.''
Fanshawe says that cultured pearls have put Bahrain's pearl divers
out of business and their chants are no more.
   After a 1975 BBC film re-enacting his journey up the Nile,
Fanshawe lived in England for three years, writing film and TV
scores. Then he spun a globe and put his finger on Fiji. He went on
a nine-month reconnaissance, then returned to England to bring his
wife and two children to Fiji, where he had secured a job as
associate sound archivist in the University of the South Pacific's
library.
   ``I embarked on a journey of eight years, building up an archive
of Pacific music. It was never done before.''
   His wife divorced him and married a tribal chief. He met and
courted his present wife on a visit to England. They married in
London in 1985 and moved to Australia. That country's National Film
and Sound Archives invited Fanshawe to house his Polynesia and
Micronesia collections and gave him a grant to continue collecting
in Melanesia.
   Of his travels in the Pacific islands, Fanshawe says, ``I have
been to Paradise. It is there. I'm not telling you which one.''

   Anthony Perkins is not an easy man to scare. A
challenging part doesn't faze the actor, nor does a demanding
director.
   But the notorious ``Norman Bates'' does have one paralyzing fear.
   ``Blooper shows always terrify me,'' said Perkins, 57, who stars
as the tortured Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde in ``Edge of Sanity.''
   ``They confirm how thin the layer is. When something funny
happens, everybody laughs right away. It doesn't take anybody more
than a tenth of a second to break up. You'd think in one of those
shows, someone, somewhere, would have to struggle to the surface
for a moment before they start to laugh.''
   Though Perkins prides himself about his inner calm, he enjoys
the menace lurking in his screen characters. When preparing for
``Edge of Sanity,'' he viewed several of the previous Jekyll-Hyde
film portrayals, including those of Jack Palance, Kirk Douglas,
Spencer Tracy and the 1931 Academy Award-winning performance of
Fredric March.
   ``I like the ones where you could see that Dr. Jekyll was not a
problem-free, easygoing dude,'' Perkins said. ``It's not fair to
show him as being too straight arrow, because after all, he has
this other side.
   Perkins cited Spencer Tracy's 1941 characterization as his
personal favorite. ``You saw between the lines as he was playing
Jekyll. You saw he had a darker, less confident side. You got a
sneaky feeling that life was not all that great even though he was
engaged to Lana Turner.''
   ``Edge of Sanity'' was filmed in Hungary, giving Perkins,
originally a stage actor, the opportunity to use an unusual method
for rehearsing his part.
   ``I got them to find me a theater that wasn't being used in
downtown Budapest,'' he said. ``I would rehearse by myself, trying
to fill the theater with a performance. I spent a couple of days
there doing the show as if it were a play.
   ``Then I did the same thing in a very small room, even if it
were a walk-in closet. I would perform it as if the doorknob were
the lens.''
   Perkins, the son of stage and film actor Osgood Perkins, was
born in New York City. Even as a child, he enjoyed getting the
attention of others.
   ``I was the one at a school assembly, if a guest speaker was
late, who could just get up on stage with nothing but a folding
chair and a blackboard and invent something that would keep going
for as long as it needed to be. I just did it, without fear.''
   He broke into movies in 1953, appearing in ``The Actress'' with
Tracy, Teresa Wright and Jean Simmons. He went on to make
``Friendly Persuasion'' in 1956 with Gary Cooper, earning him an
Oscar nomination for supporting actor, and co-starred with Gregory
Peck and Fred Astaire in the acclaimed 1959 anti-war film, ``On the
Beach.''
   But it was the legendary ``Pyscho,'' Alfred Hitchcock's classic
horror film, in 1960 that made Perkins _ and Norman Bates _
legends. The movie proved so popular that the actor starred in two
sequels and is currently preparing for ``Pyscho IV.''
   ``Norman appears on request,'' Perkins said. ``I would even say
on demand. I can dial my own personal 800 number and Norman will
reply.''
   But he retains a strong affection for the stage, starring most
recently with Mia Farrow in ``Romantic Comedy.'' Perkins has been
more critical of filmmaking, complaining that the hurried pace
prevents an actor from getting the most out of his character.
   ``You have to sit down and be able to live and breath with a
role for a long time, really squeeze the last drop out of it. You
can do that with a play, but in a film you're living with new
material every day. If you were just able to redo the scene, the
following day you'd be twice as wise about it.''
   Besides Hitchcock, Perkins has been directed by George Cukor
(``The Actress''), William Wyler (``Friendly Persuasion''), Orson
Welles (``The Trial''), Mike Nichols (``Catch-22'') and Stanley
Kramer (``On the Beach''). The actor declined to name a favorite.
   ``Anybody who can put in a day as a director on a feature film
impresses me, and I'm always the director's biggest fan, biggest
supporter,'' he said.
   ``It's my business to see that that person is the sharpest,
swiftest, funniest person most imaginative, most gifted, most
sensitive, most articulate, most visionary person alive on the
Earth today.''

<HEAD>Yes, There's Life After New Age Music</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A reshuffling of New Age radio programming
over the past year _ with more vocals and more songs possessing
something resembling a beat _ has opened up a musical niche for Tom
Grant.
   His ``Mango Tango'' LP has placed on both the Billboard
contemporary jazz and Radio and Records new adult contemporary
charts, and received extensive radio play because, Grant said, he
wisely refused to do a typical New Age style album.
   ``There has been a big change in radio,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``A year ago, there was a lot of straight New Age, real
environmental music, with lots of synthesizers, lots of spacious
music environments.''
   Grant, whose previous album ``Night Charade'' received airplay
on New Age format stations, was under pressure to produce another
LP heavily gauged to that audience.
   ``I didn't. I didn't want to get caught in that corner. I came
out with some stuff that had a beat. The music has to move people
rhythmically _ have some sock to it.''
   Grant's decision turned out to be good strategy. ``Mango Tango''
came out just when the New Age stations were changing their tune.
The album is tinged with Latin rhythm, more from Grant's upbeat
attitude in writing the music than any exposure (other than
records) to the Southern Hemisphere.
   ``I owe a lot to the fact that a lot of those stations were
willing to play that record,'' said Grant who noted that the same
stations have also been playing vocal music over the past year or
so.
   Grant, 42, attributes his style, which includes acoustic piano
as well as electronic keyboards, to growing up as the son of a jazz
and rhythm and blues record store owner in Oregon.
   ``My brother also was a jazz fanatic, and there were always
bands and musicians around our house,'' said Grant, whose ``Mango
Tango'' is on Gaia Records.
   ``For some reason, there are a lot of bands that do real well
playing original music here,'' Grant said of his native city,
Portland. ``There are a lot of clubs that will keep these bands
working, and there's a clientele for these clubs. ... There's
something in the air.'' Among his contemporaries from Portland is
musician-songwriter Patrick O'Hearn.
   Grant uses electronic keyboards but likes to keep his acoustic
playing out front.
   ``I basically consider myself a piano player,'' he said. ``I see
myself coming from the tradition of people who play fusion jazz.''
   Grant's recording career actually spans more than 13 years,
mostly on small labels, starting with ``Mystified'' on Timeless in
1976. That was recorded while he was on tour in Europe as a sideman
for saxophonist Joe Henderson. Before that, he played with sax
player Charles Lloyd in a combo that included O'Hearn as a bass
player.
   He resumed his interest in performing music after a four-year
teaching stint. He said he had gone into a tailspin following the
death of his parents within a short time of each other.
   His first albums did not set the charts on fire.
   ``I released an album in 1980 called `You Hardly Know Me,' and
it was a kind of hodgepodge of jazz, rock 'n' roll and weird
vocals. The record only got played on the left-wing stations _ on
the left side of the dial, the public-sponsored type stations,'' he
recalled.
   What displeased Grant was the unfocused sound of the LP,
definitely music from a man who hadn't made up his mind what he
wanted to do.
   ``I didn't realize until after that what I needed to focus on
was the sound of the acoustic piano,'' he said. Grant considers
1983 the year he found his own groove, signing with Pausa Records
and forming the band that stayed with him on the Gaia label. His
self-titled album in 1983 for Pausa made the Radio and Records jazz
chart.
   ``The audience must have found us,'' he said. ``After that one
record (`You Hardly') that I considered a bomb, we started out
playing a very simple kind of music.'' Still, it built a following
of record buyers and club-goers.
   Grant also believes there is a hazard in the growing use of home
studios to work out musical ideas, rather than exposure to
audiences and their reactions.
   ``There are artists who can now afford to work out all their
musical ideas at home, alone, with a vast amount of machinery that
can make them sound huge. I don't know if it's a good thing or a
bad thing, but I do think it is the source of the New Age music.''

   John A. Tuccillo thinks economic statistics
should be subject to quality control if they are to have any
significance in our lives. He believes a good many of them don't
mean very much.
   He fears they are just thrown around like confetti, and that
like confetti they are to be brushed off and forgotten. About all
they demonstrate, he suggests, is the offender's ability to use a
pocket calculator.
   Quality control might also be applied to some of the
``profound'' insights offered these days, but unlike the recent
storm of statistics, those insights have always been offered and
probably always will be.
   In on way or another, that is, Calvin Coolidge's dazzling dictum
_ ``When more and more people are thrown out of work, unemployment
results'' _ is likely to be restated just about every day. Get used
to it.
   With the numbers, however, it might be better to simply brush
them off and forget them, suggests Tuccillo, the chief economist of
the National Association of Realtors. To assist, he offers a
Reader's Guide to Economic Data.
   First: Numbers don't matter; what they represent does matter.
Inflation, for instance, is a problem only if the core rate of
inflation for the economy is rising.
   In February the Producer Price Index rose sharply because of
food and energy price jumps.
   Significant? Yes, if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries can continue to push up the price of oil and the drought
of 1988 becomes the drought of 1989. ``If not, then these are
short-term increases, and inflation will not be a continuing
problem.''
   Next: Weekly numbers are not worth printing; monthly numbers may
be little better.
   ``The only weekly number that shouuld have any validity in your
lives is the number on your pay stub.'' In the world of economics,
weekly numbers are the product of random static. Real changes take
much longer to develop.
   Third: Some popular numbers simply do not matter.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, ``like the national political
conventions and the Academy Award presentations, is essentially a
private party that has no business being thrust on the
consciousness of the average American.''
   Immediately after the stock market crash of October 1987, says
Tuccillo, we learned ``how little that number either says about, or
influences, economic life.'' Economic life went on, of course, and
the market came back as well.
   Still, several weeks passed before some people believed the
world hadn't ended. Then the facts came out, one of them being that
most people don't own stocks and so weren't hurt, proving that the
stock market is not the economy.
   Finally: Figures don't lie; liars figure. Americans are sprayed
with numbers which seem to add up but which really don't. The use
of decimaled numbers, for instance, can suggest that the message
itself is also precise.
   But, says Tuccillo, ``statistics are meaningful only in context,
and without the context they take on the flavor of `three out of
four doctors recommend asparagus souffle for a fever.'''
   The doctors, he warns, could be the fictional Drs. Seuss and
Doolittle, and Dr. J., the professional basketball player. That
demonstrates, he says, that you should look not only at the
message's content but its source too.

<HEAD>Outside Abortion Context, Legal Rights of Fetus Expanding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national debate over abortion in recent
years has focused increasingly on the legal status of the fetus,
not a ``person'' under the Constitution but protected by various
state laws and court decisions.
   ``The right-to-life movement has been largely successful in
shifting the focus to the fetus, and away from the woman and her
family, due in part to the pro-choice movement's apathy,'' said
Dawn Johnsen, legal director of the pro-choice National Abortion
Rights Action League.
   That apathy ended, she said, when the Supreme Court agreed to
review a Missouri abortion dispute in which arguments will be
conducted Wednesday.
   At stake could be the continued vitality of the court's landmark
1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   The legal status of a fetus is not a key point in the Missouri
case, just as so-called fetal rights were not a consideration in
the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
   The court ruled then that a fetus, referred to as the
``potentiality for human life,'' is not a person under the
Constitution's 14th Amendment.
   The amendment, ratified in 1868, says no state may ``deprive any
person of life, liberty or property without due process of law nor
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of
the law.''
   Roe vs. Wade said women have a constitutional right to abortion,
based on their right to privacy.
   The court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.
   It said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the
second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take
steps to protect fetal life only in the third trimester when the
fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb.
   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester
was not made absolute.
   Outside the abortion context, fetal rights had been expanding
long before 1973. The trend has continued since, although affected
by Roe vs. Wade.
   Under laws in virtually all states a child has the right to
inherit even though he or she was not yet born when the will maker
died.
   Since 1946, most states have imposed legal liability _ either
criminal or civil _ on those who willfully or negligently cause the
death or injury of a fetus.
   For example, the fetus is a person for purposes of
Massachusetts' vehicular homicide law. It is protected by murder
statutes in some states, such as Illinois, Iowa, Michigan,
Mississippi, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Utah, Washington and
Wisconsin.
   Two years ago, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that a fetus is a
person for insurance purposes.
   The state court said the parents of a 6-month-old fetus who died
as the result of an automobile crash caused by an uninsured
motorist were entitled to collect from their insurance company for
``loss of consortium.''
   NARAL's Johnsen said in a recent interview that treating a fetus
differently in differing legal contexts is not inconsistent and
said she has no quarrel with laws that protect ``the woman and her
wanted fetus.''
   In a 1986 law journal article, Johnsen wrote: ``Holding third
parties responsible for negligent or criminal destruction of
fetuses is consistent with, and even enhances, the protection of
pregnant women's interests.''
   But the article criticized courts for failing ``to recognize the
fundamental differences between a woman deciding to terminate her
own pregnancy and a third party intruding upon her body to end that
pregnancy against her will.''
   James Bopp, general counsel of the National Right to Life
Committee, bristles when discussing the ``potentiality of human
life'' phrase used in Roe vs. Wade.
   ``Is it human life? Of course,'' he said in an interview. ``No
woman has ever given birth to anything but a member of the species
so it is human. And it's a biological fact that it's alive.''
   He said, ``The central question is whether the fetus has valued
human qualities that society wants to protect. The question is
whether taking the life of the unborn is consequential.''
   Johnsen disagrees. ``Defining the fetus as human life does not
answer any questions about the legal status of a fetus,'' she said.
``The central question is the legal implications of treating a
fetus as a person under the law.''
   She called extending 14th Amendment protection to a fetus a
dangerous step because it would necessitate balancing the fetal
right to life against a woman's right to privacy.
   ``Once you say politicians can speak in behalf of the fetus,
there's no stopping point,'' Johnsen said.

<HEAD>Two Decades of Good Music at Louisiana Jazz and Heritage Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All you need for the annual Louisiana Jazz
and Heritage Festival is a good set of ears, some comfortable
clothes and lots of napkins to wipe the grease from your lips.
   The festival launches its 20th anniversary this month with a
two-week, $3 million celebration featuring 3,000 musicians and tons
of good food.
   ``I honestly think the New Orleans festival is not only the
largest but the most important in the world,'' said George Wein,
the producer who founded the New Orleans event and helped launch
others, including the famed Newport Jazz Festival.
   ``Lots of big name artists come to the Jazz Fest and hide
themselves in the crowd so they can enjoy it.''
   The formula for success has been fine-tuned since that first
1969 festival in Congo Square off Rampart Street, and this year's
event, scheduled April 28 through May 7, will look a lot like the
one last year.
   ``It's been so successful that we didn't see any reason to
change it,'' said Anna Zimmerman, spokeswoman for the festival.
   ``We're always looking for ways to make things work better, but
we looked into the archives about when it started and it's
basically the same _ it's just bigger. ... We're expecting 300,000
and we'll be happy with that.''
   The festival is really two events _ a series of evening jazz
concerts and a pair of weekend heritage fairs with open-air stages
surrounded by food and crafts.
   This year's concerts feature Wynton Marsalis, Miles Davis,
George Benson, Jimmy Buffett, Al Green and Santana.
   Some of their performances will be in a new riverside tent on
the banks of the Mississippi River _ the most conspicuous change in
the way the festival is staged this year.
   In the past, nightly riverboat concerts aboard the President
were an integral part of the program, but the owners moved the old
paddlewheeler to a new station at St. Louis, leaving festival
organizers to find a new forum.
   They resorted to a big tent, which will have more seats, better
views and _ they hope _ better acoustics than the boat.
   The weekend concerts will be held at the Fair Grounds, the
nation's second oldest horse race track. Eleven performing areas in
stages, tents and gazebos, each strategically positioned to cut
down on overlapping sound, will be set up on the infield inside the
dirt track.
   The schedule calls for continuous music from midday to dark _
Cajun, country and western, rhythm and blues and, of course, lots
of jazz.
   ``The heritage of the area includes a large variety of music,''
said Wein. ``People can choose the type of music they want.''
   Performers at the Fair Grounds range from dozens of local
favorites to some of the stars of evening concerts, plus such
drawing cards as Fats Domino, Robert Cray, Ricky Skaggs, Pete
Fountain, Rita Coolidge, the Neville Brothers, Pete Seeger, Bonnie
Raitt and Irma Thomas.
   ``You just put on your cutoffs and your T-shirt and join in,''
said Thomas, who performs April 30. ``It's great _ the music and
the food. All you need is some money and your Rolaids because you
always eat too much.'' Food booths will feature local samplers to
exotic imports: crawfish, alligator, goat, oyster, shrimp, chicken,
and red beans and rice.
   Organizers counted 124 food dishes on the menu this year. Their
only estimate on volume came from one of the festival sponsors, who
sold 9,000 pounds of rice in the two weekends last year.
   ``Everyone has a Louisiana taste,'' said Sonny Vaucresson who
serves up Cajun and Creole sausages. ``Every year we get more
people trying them. We just dish it up and watch them walk away
happy.''
   ``We sure do cook it up,'' said Joseph McDermott, in charge of
the Second Mount Triumph Missionary Baptist Church food booth. The
church sells $2 and $4 portions of fried chicken and potato salad,
which McDermott describes as ``just good old home style cooking.''
   Crafts from Louisiana's many cultures are also on sale in long
lines of tents: handmade jewelry, Indian pottery, Mardi Gras masks,
Acadian accordians, African jewelry, quilts and a variety of folk
arts.
   ``If you don't enjoy it ... if you don't enjoy New Orleans and
the festival, then you don't enjoy living,'' said Wein.

   Irma Thomas never misses Jazz Fest. If the
famed blues artist isn't on stage, she's out front listening or at
a food booth eating.
   ``Oh, yes, indeed!,'' she said. ``I try to be everywhere at
once. That's the only bad part. There are always two or three
things going on at once and you can't hit them all.
   ``There's so much good music, I try to listen to it all. And the
food is just as bad. I try to have some of it all, too. Everyone
overeats at the Jazz Fest.''
   The two-week celebration, formally known as the New Orleans Jazz
and Heritage Festival, begins April 28. In the lineup are 3,000
musicians, with the weekend fairs featuring continuous music on 11
stages. Thomas will perform April 30, continuing an uninterrupted
string of appearances that began in 1974.
   ``You get a real international audience at the Jazz Fest,'' she
said. ``People from all over the world are in the crowd and they
are all very knowledgeable.
   ``They will let me do some new things and some popular numbers,
but they always want to hear my oldies _ `It's Raining,' `Wish
Someone Would Care' _ the songs they remember.''
   Although she performs her soulful rendition of the blues all
over the world, Thomas is still considered a ``New Orleans artist.''
   ``It's OK. I have no problem with being a New Orleans artist
even though most of the major labels seem to shy away from you once
you're known as one. I think it's because we're all kind of
stubborn when it comes to change. We know how we want our music to
sound and we won't agree to strings instead of brass or
synthesizers or different things producers in other places think
sound right,'' she said.
   Thomas' most recent recording, ``The Way I Feel,'' on the
Rounder label, maintains the New Orleans feeling.
   At 48, Thomas, who has been performing for 31 years, has
developed a large and loyal following.
   ``Rita Coolidge and I have really become good friends and mutual
fans,'' she said. ``We try to do a set or two together at the Jazz
Fest. And you can always see other singers and musicians out in the
audience. A lot of those who perform there also stick around to
listen to the others.''
   Jazz Fest is as much a food fair as a music festival, and Thomas
is known among family and friends for virtuoso performances in the
kitchen as well.
   ``People are always telling me I should write a cook book,'' she
said with a laugh. ``I like cooking and I know good food, that's
for sure.''
   Her four children are grown and have left home, as have the
three of her husband-manager, Emile Jackson. But she still spends
plenty of time at the stove.
   ``I'm always making something, or Emile wants a treat, or I just
want to taste some real food,'' she said. ``If I ever stop singing,

<TEXT>
   When horror maven Stephen King taught
creative writing at the University of Maine, he moved his family
into a house near a cemetery for pets.
   The setting inspired the best-selling author's ``Pet Sematary,''
which he adapted to the screen for the new Paramount Pictures
horror movie.
   The house was on Route 15, a speedway for truckers. Dogs, cats
and other animals didn't stand a chance.
   ``Everything in the book and in the movie is true _ up to a
certain point where it crosses the line into fantasy,'' King said
in an interview.
   Directed by Mary Lambert (``Siesta''), the movie stars Dale
Midkiff as Louis Creed, Fred Gwynne as his neighbor, Jud, and
Denise Crosby as his wife, Rachel. It features a cameo appearance
by King, who portrays a minister presiding at the funeral of the
Creeds' 2-year-old son, who wanders out to the highway chasing a
kitten and is hit by a truck.
   ``Pet Sematary,'' whose theme of returning from the dead is
derivative of the popular tale ``The Monkey's Paw,'' is a thriller
that unravels the evil legacy of an ancient Indian burial ground.
   While living in Orrington, where giant fertilizer trucks
frequently sped along the highway in front of his house, King
witnessed the deathof his daughter's cat, Smucky. In ``Pet
Sematary,'' little Ellie Creed's cat, Church, meets the same fate.
   The King feline was immortalized in the novel and the movie with
a grave marker that read, ``Smucky, he was obedient.''
   Even more anguishing to King was the time he tackled his
2-year-old son just as he was about to dash onto the road, an
episode that inspired the tragic denouement of ``Pet Sematary.''
   The film and the novel reflect the terror that strikes at the
hearts of parents when they recognize how precious and fragile the
lives of their young children can be, King said.
   ``We're not talking about Freddie or Jason here,'' he said,
referring to the popular villains of the ``Nightmare on Elm
Street'' and ``Friday the 13th'' series. ``We're talking about a
kid who gets killed in a senseless road accident.''
   Following publication of the 1983 novel, which remained on the
New York Times best-seller list for more than 30 weeks, souvenir
hunters visited the Orrington cemetery and removed most of the
grave markers.
   Millions of readers have paid vicarious visits to rural Maine
through King's spine-chilling novels, but ``Pet Sematary'' is the
first movie adaptation to be filmed in the author's home state.
   Aside from scenes of a roadside neon lobster sign, Bangor
International Airport or the clock tower in downtown Ellsworth, the
Maine setting provides a feel for a state that has seldom been
showcased by Hollywood producers, the author said.
   ``It adds a lot,'' he said, predicting that audiences will
appreciate the authenticity of the locale. ``They're going to know
that it's Maine. And just as important, they're going to know that
it's not California.''
   King, whose other books have been filmed in such locations as
California, North Carolina, Oregon and the Canadian province of
Ontario, insisted that ``Pet Sematary'' be made in Maine.
   It was seen as a shot in the arm for the nascent Maine Film
Commission, which has been trying to lure production companies to
Maine and help the state recover from its disappointing loss of
``On Golden Pond'' to neighboring New Hampshire.
   While the fictitious setting of ``Pet Sematary'' is called
Ludlow _ a town located in Aroostook County _ King acknowledged
that the cemetery site is actually in Orrington, a suburb 10 miles
outside Bangor. He lived there when he returned to the state
university, his alma mater, as a writer-in-residence.
   King, who has been openly critical of the movie versions of
several of his books, has nothing but praise for the latest film,
which is also the only one for which he wrote the screenplay. Rob
Reiner's highly acclaimed ``Stand By Me'' remains his favorite
movie adaptation of his writings.
   A Maine native, the author acknowledges that his familiarity
with his home state makes it an ideal setting for his fiction, but
he feels the nature of the place also provides a gothic flavor.
   ``We're a little bit cut off, a little bit insular here, and
it's truer as you get further north,'' he said. ``I like to get
away from the centers of population, to places where things could
happen and no one would really know.''

   ``I've got a hot one for you,'' whispers the
stock tout furtively into the telephone.
   ``It's a high-tech outfit with increasing earnings growth, and
the big money managers haven't picked up on it yet. Name's American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph.''
   An unlikely script? Perhaps. But after spending decades as the
epitome of the staid blue chip, AT&amp;T stock has lately been
threatening to transform itself into something more zippy.
   When it climbed to $34.62 last week in response to a
first-quarter earnings report that lived up to Wall Street's hopes,
AT&amp;T sported a gain of 20.4 percent since the beginning of 1989,
roughly doubling the performance of the market as a whole.
   The rally put the stock just a little more than a point shy of
the peak of $35.87 it reached before the crash of 1987, while many
other big-name issues still languish far from their former highs.
   ``The shares of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph have been one of
the market's better performers so far this year, and we believe
they will continue to do well on an intermediate and long-term
basis,'' asserts the current edition of the Merrill Lynch Market
Letter.
   Such sanguine appraisals have seldom been heard on Wall Street
in recent years, especially since the company was established in
its current form with the breakup of the Bell System on Jan. 1,
1984.
   The ``Baby Bells'' _ the seven regional operating companies that
were split off from AT&amp;T in the divestiture _ almost immediately
galloped out ahead of their progenitor.
   Within three years, all of them more than doubled in price. The
new AT&amp;T, which had begun trading at $19, meanwhile struggled along
in the mid $20s.
   The Baby Bells showered their owners with dividend increases and
stock splits. AT&amp;T's dividend remained stuck at $1.20 a share. It
even reported a loss for 1988, as a result of a $3.9 billion
special charge it took to write off outdated equipment.
   A once-popular and widely understood company with more than 3
million shareholders had become a murky entity involved in a
mixture of new and old ventures whose prospects were difficult to
discern.
   ``There have been many _ and often confusing _ changes in the
company'' since the breakup, Merrill Lynch analysts acknowledge in
a written appraisal.
   ``But we believe AT&amp;T now is heading into a period of steady and
sustainable earnings growth that will make its stock more
attractive to investors.
   ``Among other things, the company seems likely to win more
attention from large institutional investors, who now own only 24
percent of its stock _ a relatively low level for one of the
largest and most widely held stocks.''
   At its annual meeting last Wednesday, the company reported a
20.7 percent earnings increase for the first quarter. Chairman
Robert Allen said that pace was ``not an aberration'' and might
well be sustained in quarters to come.
   The company attributed its improved results to better profits
from long-distance operations and from international sales of its
products and services. Merrill Lynch expects it also to show
smaller losses from its computer business as the year progresses.
   In a deregulated world, AT&amp;T continues to face more competition
and risks than it ever knew before the breakup. As big as it
remains, it cannot reasonably hope to produce the kind of dramatic
earnings gains that true growth-stock fanciers like to see.
   Still, as its stock price shows, the company seems lately to
have won back some old friends on Wall Street, and even made some
new ones.

   Six-year-olds bundled in coats sit
shoulder to shoulder on benches in the classroom, each working
desperately to solve an algebra problem and beat the others.
   Eager hands shoot into the air as the 54 children vie to get the
answer first and be noticed in a country where education in a
tough, regimented school system is a national obsession.
   ``Koreans are the hardest workers in the world,'' said Lee
Jean-jae, director of the National Institute of Education
Evaluation. ``They study without letup.''
   The system produces pupils who achieve some of the highest
scores in international testing, but:
   Can it teach the thinking and reasoning processes needed to
apply the information and deal with life? Does their education
prepare youngsters to be good citizens? Does it produce innovative,
creative thinkers needed for the future?
   Some critics say no.
   Korean education, like the system in neighboring Japan, is based
on rote memorization. That enables a student who works hard to
produce enormous amounts of facts and data that result in
impressive scores on tests designed for such a regimen.
   In South Korea, education is equated with success. The argument
goes: The more education, the more success; the more people
educated, the greater success for the nation.
   Detractors say the system clones human computers who can pour
out endless streams of information but cannot think creatively, and
that it contributes to the insecurity and tension that beset South
Korean society.
   The American manager of a company in Seoul said he hired a dozen
Koreans with master's degrees in business administration who
recited verbatim the case studies in any textbook they had read but
had difficulty being creative about daily tasks.
   Robert A. Brown, a linguistics professor at Ewha Women's
University in Seoul, says the rote approach suits the society's
traditional Confucian respect for the scholar.
   As he explained it, ``The teacher knows something, talks to the
students, who absorb it. They don't doubt, they memorize, and that
ties into the exam.
   ``They teach what they test for. You can't change the test
without changing the curriculum.''
   Under that system, Brown said, a student fails to memorize ``at
his own risk.''
   A South Korean professor said privately his country is
``educating barbarians.'' He said students become disillusioned and
feel deceived when they go to college, start asking questions and
face conflicting opinions for the first time.
   Many become alienated and join the ranks of radical students
who, although a small minority, have become extremely vocal and
demonstrate, often violently, to demand the overthrow of the
government and the expulsion of U.S. troops from South Korea.
   Increasingly militant labor unions include thousands of high
school graduates who could not get into a university and feel the
system cheated them.
   A high score on the college entrance exam often is a ticket to
the elite class through a good college, prestigious job and higher
standard of living. It is family insurance in a nation that was
ravaged by war only 36 years ago.
   Like marching ranks of well-trained soldiers, young Koreans
slave over books and endure physical and psychological hardship to
pursue prestige and success in the scholastic sweepstakes.
   A recent assessment of mathematics and science by the
Educational Testing Service compared 24,000 13-year-olds in
Ireland, Spain, Britain, the United States, South Korea and Canada.
   South Korean 13-year-olds were highest in mathematics and tied
for the honors in science with youngsters from British Columbia,
Canada.
   Several Korean educators who saw the test involved said it would
be easy for a Korean 13-year-old. An Education Ministry said he
would come down hard on 9- and 10-year-old Koreans if they could
not answer the questions.
   Lee, the National Institute of Education Evaluation director,
said he was not surprised by the high Korean scores or by those in
the United States, which ran last. He said said U.S. math and
science texts are too easy.
   Children in South Korea devote countless hours to memorizing
facts and copying from textbooks.
   Some as young as 10 stay up all night doing homework. By the
last years of high school, they study more than 12 hours a day in a
stressful contest said by its critics to waste minds rather than
building them.

<DATELINE>CHUGWATER, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The regulars who drifted into the Buffalo
Grill for a hamburger or the luncheon special, chicken-fried steak,
hadn't heard of Republican strategist Ed Rollins. Nor did they care
about any national trends Washington pundits see in the race to
fill Dick Cheney's House seat.
   To them, it's just a choice between two Wyoming politicians.
   As good as any Gallup poll, owner-cook Gary Matz stood in the
doorway of the grill's kitchen and nodded toward a couple eating
the luncheon special.
   ``Strong Republican,'' he said.
   Chalk up two votes for Craig Thomas. Another patron, he said, is
a vote for Democrat John Vinich.
   In this town of 282 people, two grain elevators, a hotel, the
grill, a couple of stores, a garage and the Chugwater Chili Co.,
Matz has a pretty good sense of his patrons' politics. ``Strong
Republican'' covers most people.
   Without the benefit of a Matz in every community scattered
across the nation's most sparsely populated state, the two
campaigns are doing their own daily polling. As the campaign headed
toward the balloting Wednesday, a slight trend toward Thomas was
turning up.
   ``We're showing everything just about dead even right now,''
said Howard Schloss, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
   When asked if there was any movement, Schloss conceded, ``A
little bit away from us.''
   John Buckley, spokesman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said their polling shows ``the numbers are
widening up a little bit'' in favor of Thomas.
   Yet national GOP officials remained markedly nervous about the
special election to fill the only House seat in this state where
Republicans outnumber Democrats by 3 to 2.
   A GOP loss would be the third in a month and the second in which
the Democrats capture a House seat held by a Republican. First the
Democrats took Dan Quayle's old House seat in Indiana and then
easily beat back a GOP effort to turn the tables in Alabama. The
special election losses have been a political cold shower for a
party still celebrating its fifth victory in the last six
presidential elections.
   And when President Bush created another vacancy by naming Cheney
Secretary of Defense, the Democrats had a campaign-hardened
candidate ready to compete for the seat in this Western state.
   Vinich, a 38-year-old state senator, came within 1,300 votes of
upsetting Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop last November, an effort
that gave the Democrat a big edge in name recognition over Thomas.
   ```Nearly beat Malcolm Wallop' comes out like one word every
time they mention him (Vinich),'' lamented Thomas, 55. ``Here's a
guy who's been running for a year and a half.''
   Enter Rollins, the million-dollar consultant hired by House
Republicans frustrated by the fact they hold 17 fewer seats now
than they did when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated president in 1981.
Given a four-year contract and a mandate to reverse GOP fortunes,
Rollins saw his first two races end in defeat.
   ``Wyoming is something I've had hands on since day one,'' he
said.
   That handed Vinich a perfect issue in a state where meddling by
outsiders, particularly from Washington, is resented.
   ``The outside Washington consultants have taken charge of the
Thomas campaign,'' taunted a Vinich television commercial.
   Then the national GOP committee commissioned a poll, asking
voters if they'd change their opinion of Vinich if they knew there
was a third person _ a Democratic consultant from Washington _ in
the car when the candidate was involved in a traffic accident.
   State police said only two people were in the car. Democrats,
with some relish, denounced the question as ``gutter politics.''
   With his Washington friends, Thomas was looking like he had no
need of enemies.
   ``It was an unnecessary nuisance,'' he said, ``and I'm mad about
it and fed up with it.'' The GOP candidate said he'd held ``a
seminar'' with Rollins to make it clear who was in charge of the
campaign.
   In Washington, the political knives were out for Rollins.
   ``We're on the defensive when we should be on a roll,'' said a
prominent Republican operative, who insisted on anonymity.
``Rollins has whipped this thing way, way out in front on national
interference. ... Local folks don't appreciate that and the
Democrats have used it well.''
   Thomas struck back against Vinich, with his own charges of
outside influence, focusing on contributions to the Democrat from
the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the Seafarers
Union.
   ``Dukakis and Vinich are cut out of the same cloth,'' said
Thomas, linking his opponent to Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis, who took only 39 percent of Wyoming's vote.
   ``I don't think the liberal thing is catching hold,'' said
Vinich, while conceding that ``in certain areas the labor thing
might be catching hold more.''
   Among the ranchers and small businessmen in Wyoming, union is a
dirty word. The state has a right-to-work law and Thomas contended
Vinich would like to repeal it.
   For a while it sounded like the issues in Wyoming were a choice
between Ed Rollins and the AFL-CIO. All this in a state where
because of the slump in energy and agriculture, the population
declined by 30,000 in the past four years.
   From that point on, the race didn't get any kinder or gentler.
   Vinich came up with his version of the Willie Horton ad that so
effectively suggested Dukakis was soft on crime. The Democrat,
questioning Thomas' conservative credentials, ran an ad saying
Thomas had voted in the Wyoming House ``for a bill to grant early
release from jail for convicted felons. Thomas thought there wasn't
enough room, so his solution was to let them out on the streets.''
   The ad referred to the state's split-sentencing law that
authorized sending those convicted of non-violent crimes to county
jails to ease overcrowding in state prisons.
   Thomas wasn't alone in voting for the bill. All but two members
of the Wyoming House backed it and only Vinich in the state Senate
opposed it.
   Despite criticism from many Democrats, Vinich refused to
withdraw the ad.
   Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan is a Democrat who won an upset
victory over Pete Simpson in the 1986 gubernatorial race. The
brother of popular Sen. Alan Simpson, Sullivan's opponent was
heavily favored.
   ``I campaigned hard and I took a pretty conservative position,''
Sullivan said of his race. ``There may even have been a perception
that Pete was more liberal than I was.''
   Sullivan says he doesn't like negative ads, even as he conceded
they can work.
   Back at the Buffalo Grill, Gary Matz said he's an independent
and a conservative. But he intends to vote for Vinich because
``Thomas says agriculture isn't important,'' a line that comes
straight from a Vinich ad that Thomas has denounced as false.

<HEAD>Family Ties Rings the Final Dinner Bell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When actor Michael J. Fox was invited seven
years ago to read the part of Alex P. Keaton for the new show
``Family Ties,'' he was a walking poster child for Hollywood
heartbreak.
   ``I was at a point,'' Fox said recently, holding up a
thimble-sized container of coffee creamer, ``where I'd say, `Can
you eat this?' Three ketchups, a thing of cream and a package of
salt and pepper and I was pigging out.''
   But Fox hasn't had to worry about his pantry since he picked up
that first ``Family Ties'' script and was handed the job, too. The
situation comedy, which is leaving the NBC schedule with a one-hour
special May 14, has lasted longer than ``Leave it to Beaver,''
``The Flintstones'' or ``Hogan's Heroes.''
   The departure of ``Family Ties,'' planned for two years, won't
match the majestic 1983 parting of CBS' ``M-A-S-H.'' But the
program's exit after seven seasons does illustrate how one modest
series both created careers and helped revitalize a stagnant
television genre, the nuclear-family sitcom.
   ``We could do more, stick around and do three more years,'' said
Gary David Goldberg, the show's creator and executive producer.
``But why? We've done 180 episodes of this show and this family.
Surely, there must be other things we want to turn our attention
to.''
   The actors of ``Family Ties'' shared a chaotic mixture of
sadness, gratitude and exuberance as their program's last episode
approached, as the character of Alex set off for a job on Wall
Street, where there aren't any more television cameras.
   ``I have very ambiguous feelings about it,'' Meredith Baxter
Birney, who plays ``Family Ties'' parent Elyse Keaton, said of the
show's conclusion. ``I think I'm going to be dreadfully emotional
the last couple of days. But until then, I'm so excited, I can't
see straight!''
   All of the cast now will have time to pursue other projects. But
without ``Family Ties,'' a half-hour centering on consumer-minded
children in a home headed by former hippies, there might not be any
such projects to pursue.
   ``There is no way to overemphasize how important (``Family
Ties'') was for me,'' Fox said. ``With all the things I have going
on right now, everybody says, `Boy, I bet you can't wait to get
that chain off your neck.' But I never think of it in those terms.
... The success through association that I've enjoyed, that's
really been the blessing.''
   Justine Bateman, who co-stars in ``Family Ties'' as dippy,
dress-for-excess older daughter Mallory, says she doesn't have to
follow her prominence on ``Family Ties'' with other prominent roles.
   ``I am definitely looking forward to playing other characters,''
she said. ``But because of `Family Ties,' I have the unique
privilege of not having to worry about paying the mortgage. So now
I can just work with good people ... and not have the pressure of
carrying a film.''
   Other ``Family Ties'' veterans are using the show's ending to
follow related interests. Fifteen-year-old Tina Yothers, who plays
younger sister Jennifer, will now have more time for her singing
career, more time to polish her rendition of ``Baby, I'm Back in
Love Again.''
   Yet just as the show's once dominant popularity has brought the
cast fame and riches _ ``Family Ties'' was the nation's No. 2
program in the 1985-86 and 1986-87 TV seasons, just a step behind
NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' _ the exposure also means the actors must
prove there's more to them than good timing and silly jokes.
   Will audiences for years see Michael Gross only as the Keaton
family's goofy dad Steven? Can anybody take Bateman seriously after
so much of Mallory's ditziness? It is not an idle question.
   After leaving ``M-A-S-H,'' for example, Alan Alda starred in a
variety of film and television roles, but the actor is still looked
upon by many only as army surgeon Capt. Hawkeye Pierce. Similarly,
Patrick Duffy left CBS' ``Dallas'' to chase other roles, but his
``Dallas'' reputation was so ingrained he was forced to come back
to the serial.
   ``Obviously, to a certain extent, this thing is a double-edged
sword,'' said Gross. ``I sometimes wonder if some actors don't
spend the entire first part of their careers looking for a
television series and the entire second half of their careers
trying to elude the persona that they've created in that television
series.
   ``I am going at the problem by seeking other things. I routinely
turn down offers that deal with fathers and teen-agers,'' Gross
said. ``People see (``Family Ties'') and they say, `Oh, good.
That's what he does.' And I put the word out, `No, he doesn't.'''
   Said Fox, who will co-star with Sean Penn in the coming Vietnam
film ``Casualties of War'': ``I keep doing these serious films, and
if they do well, they do well. If they don't, I'm also comfortable
being a shtick man. I don't mind getting two minutes for high
shticking.''

<TEXT>
   Frank Susman's commitment to abortion rights
began 20 years ago when, as a legal volunteer for a suicide
hotline, he realized how many women with unwanted pregnancies were
considering killing themselves.
   This week, that commitment takes him before the U.S. Supreme
Court to argue the most important abortion case since the procedure
was legalized in 1973.
   On Wednesday, Susman will present oral arguments against a
Missouri law that he and other pro-choice advocates believe poses a
serious threat to abortion rights. The anti-abortion side will be
argued by Missouri Attorney General William Webster, in support of
the law, and Harvard professor Charles Fried, representing the Bush
administration, which seeks to overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade
decision of 1973.
   ``Clearly this is the greatest threat to women's liberty in
those 16 years,'' said the 47-year-old Susman, who acknowledges
feeling great pressure. ``You spend most of your time thinking,
cogitating, meditating, just thinking about it and reshuffling the
cards.''
   It was in the late 1960s and early '70s that Susman, working as
a volunteer lawyer for Suicide Prevention Inc., realized the
anguish of women with unwanted pregnancies.
   ``It was difficult then, as it is now, to imagine anything as
horrendous as being pregnant and not wanting to be,'' he said in an
interview Friday.
   That work led him to help another group that assisted women
seeking legal abortions out of state or illegal abortions locally.
   ``I had never known a person who had had an abortion until
then,'' he said.
   Susman has argued abortion cases before the Supreme Court
before, but never one as potentially damaging to abortion rights as
Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.
   The Missouri law, passed in 1986, restricts abortion by banning
the procedure in publicly funded hospitals and forbidding the use
of public funds, and declares that human life begins at conception.
   The law was blocked from going into effect by a class-action
suit led by Reproductive Health Services of St. Louis, Planned
Parenthood of Greater Kansas City and others.
   The U.S. District Court in Kansas City declared major sections
of the law unconstitutional. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the decision. The Supreme Court agreed earlier this year to
hear the case.
   Susman, who represents about 20 abortion clinics nationwide on a
part-time basis, once stopped at a clinic to help escort clients
past pickets.
   ``I just happened to be driving by and saw this mob scene,''
Susman said. Later, one of the picketers sued him for $250,000,
claiming he'd assaulted her as he walked a woman to the clinic. A
jury cleared him.
   Susman's commitment to his belief that women should be allowed
to make their own decisions on abortion has made him a target for
harassment by mail and telephone. Someone once placed a bogus ad in
a St. Louis paper that said his house was for sale. More recently,
the phone lines to his home were cut.
   ``The threats don't bother me at all for myself,'' he said.
``They bother me for members of my family. That concerns me.''
   Susman said he respected his opponents' depth of commitment to
their belief. ``But I strongly criticize their total intolerance
and inability to perceive how anyone could disagree with them,'' he
said.
   ``No one really knows what they think about abortion until they
are faced with a pregnancy that they don't want,'' he said. ``I've
never seen an abortion for convenience. It's a gut-wrenching,
agonizing decision.''

   The Missouri abortion case being
argued before the U.S. Supreme Court this week will be the first
state Attorney General William Webster has personally argued before
the justices since being elected in 1984.
   Although some observers say Webster has tried not to politicize
the case, critics wonder if the 35-year-old Republican is using it
to boost his political future. Webster is already laying the
groundwork for a 1992 bid for governor.
   Tony Feather, executive director of the Missouri Republican
Party, expressed doubt that politics was behind Webster's decision
to personally argue before the court, but acknowledged the case has
not hurt him.
   ``He's already got a strong political benefit out of it by the
fact that it's gone this far. I don't think he would argue it if he
didn't think he was the best attorney for it,'' Feather said.
   Six Missouri cases have been heard by the U.S. Supreme Court
during Webster's tenure.
   In next week's arguments, Webster will defend a 1986 Missouri
law prohibiting the use of public funds for abortions and declaring
that human life begins at conception. Sections of the law were
found unconstitional by the U.S. District Court in Kansas City, and
that decision was upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``Given the publicity the case is getting, it's hard not to say
that Webster is arguing it to promote himself,'' Thomas Blumenthal,
a lawyer for abortion rights advocates, said recently. ``This makes
it more obvious this is a political question, not a legal one.''
   Webster contends he is merely trying to do the best job possible
on the case, named Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.
   ``This is one of the most important cases of the term. It is one
of national significance and it merits my personal participation,''
Webster said through a spokeswoman, Mary Jenkins.
   Feather said Webster has sequestered himself in his office in
recent weeks to study the case and has shut off interviews.
Webster, a former radio reporter, is usually accessible to
reporters.
   ``We've bent over backwards not to politicize this case,'' Ms.
Jenkins said.
   A native of Carthage in southwestern Missouri, Webster earned a
speech and communications degree from the University of Kansas
before getting his law degree from the University of
Missouri-Kansas City. He practiced law in Joplin before being
elected attorney general.
   When he was first elected attorney general in 1984, he was 31 _
the youngest person to hold that office in Missouri in nearly 100
years.
   Webster is ``personally pro-life, but he feels that his personal
views are irrelevant. It is his constitutional duty to uphold the
law,'' Ms. Jenkins said.

<HEAD>Scholar and Litigator to Argue Bush Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Fried, who will represent the Bush
administration when the Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday in
a Missouri abortion case, says he considers himself more a legal
scholar than a litigator.
   The Harvard University law school professor, author of six books
on the law, has the proper academic credentials. But he also served
as solicitor general _ the government's top-ranked courtroom lawyer
_ for four years.
   During that tenure, he was criticized by those who said he was
too willing to mix litigation with ideological politics.
   In the Justice Department's No. 3 job, Fried was viewed as a
champion of the Reagan administration's conservative social agenda.
In appearances before the Supreme Court, he vigorously opposed
broad use of affirmative action and expansive interpretations of
civil rights law.
   And he once urged the court to overturn its landmark Roe vs.
Wade decision, which legalized abortion in 1973.
   In a 1985 friend-of-the-court brief supporting Pennsylvania
abortion regulations that were later invalidated by a 4-4 high
court vote, Fried said Roe vs. Wade ``is so far flawed that this
court should overrule it.''
   ``There is no explicit textual warrant in the Constitution for a
right to an abortion,'' Fried wrote in that brief.
   The chances of the court reversing its seminal abortion ruling
at that time were viewed as very slim.
   But Fried dismissed the criticism generated by his brief's
approach. ``I think there's something condescending about only
saying things which, on some kind of nose-counting prognostication,
the court is going to adopt,'' he said.
   He accused the news media of doing a poor job in reporting the
1985 brief.
   ``The press, which does not like to read things but prefers to
call people up on the telephone and provoke them into
indiscretions, called me a lot when that brief was filed,'' Fried
told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce audience.
   ``They said, `What was the reason for you taking the position
you did?' And that gave me a chance to say, `You don't understand.
A brief is not like a symphony. It's not like a directive. It's not
even like a proclamation. A brief is nothing but reasons.'''
   Although he left his government post to return to Harvard last
January, Fried was asked to return to represent the solicitor
general's office in Wednesday's argument.
   Fried, 53, is the son of a Jewish-Czech industrialist. When he
was 4, his family fled the Nazis and moved to England, then to the
United States.
   A brilliant student, Fried excelled at Princeton, Oxford and
Columbia's law school. He served as a law clerk to the late Supreme
Court Justice John Harlan during the court's 1960-61 term before
becoming one of the youngest individuals ever appointed as a member
of the Harvard faculty.

<HEAD>Bush, in First 100 Days, Offers Few Clues About Where He's Going</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush is nearing the 100-day milestone
of his presidency boasting of scattered achievements and riding
high in the polls, but offering few clues about the mystery that
has long surrounded him.
   The questions: where is he going, what does he stand for, what
does he want to do?
   He wants to be known as the education president but draws
criticism for his proposed $441 million program, inexpensive by
Washington standards, to reward excellence among students and
schools.
   He calls himself an environmentalist but comes under attack for
not moving more quickly to limit the spread of the America's worst
oil spill.
   He takes a stand against tougher gun controls but then turns
around and authorizes a temporary ban on imports of semiautomatic
assault weapons.
   ``I think his grade is incomplete,'' said presidential scholar
James David Barber of Duke University. ``We still have yet to see
what he is going to do, if anything.''
   ``There is a puzzlement about what George Bush stands for,''
agreed Thomas Cronin, a political scientist at Colorado College.
   ``Ronald Reagan was able to be a Mr. Rogers and a John Wayne
back and forth. He was neighborly and friendly but he occasionally
took a hard ideological stand,'' Cronin said. ``Bush is neither.
He's not defined. The American people are not sure who he is.''
   Countering claims that he's off to a slow start, Bush cites his
budget and deficit-reduction agreement with Congress and a
bipartisan plan for humanitarian aid for Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Moreover, he points to his proposal for rescuing the ailing
savings and loan industry, his plan to tighten ethical standards in
government, his diplomacy with leaders from the Middle East, and a
new formula to ease Third World debt.
   ``I think we're moving reasonably well,'' Bush said Thursday.
``And I don't even think in terms of 100 days because we aren't
radically shifting things. ... We didn't come in here throwing the
rascals out to try to do something _ correct all the ills of the
world in 100 days.''
   White House chief of staff John Sununu bristles at suggestions
that Bush is moving too cautiously, taking too much time, for
instance, reviewing foreign policy strategy before renewing arms
talks with the Soviet Union.
   ``When George Bush had to make quick decisions, you got them,''
Sununu said.
   ``You got the savings and loan plan in two weeks. You got a
budget plan laid out on Feb. 9.
   ``Everytime there's an opportunity there, he's gone out and
jumped on it,'' Sununu said. ``And where opportunities do exist for
considered evaluation, you get that, too.''
   Many people think it's unrealistic to judge a president by his
first 100 days, a standard first applied to Franklin D. Roosevelt's
administration as he tried to pull America out of the Depression.
   For Bush, the 100th day falls next Saturday.
   ``Rather than look at 100 days, look at the first crisis test.
That will tell you more about this White House,'' said Tom Griscom,
former White House communications chief under Reagan.
   Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the American Enteprise
Institute, said a president should be judged by his first six
months, not first three.
   ``In the first phase of a presidency, we see set in place a
stereotype, an image as it were, of what kind of president we
have,'' Ornstein said. ``It takes a while for that to set in. First
it sets in among the opinion leaders, then it spreads out beyond
the beltway.''
   As much as Americans loved Reagan and his bigger-than-life
image, they seem charmed by Bush's openness and down-to-earth style.
   He plays with puppies, pitches horseshoes and coddles his
grandchildren. He likes to fish and drive a fast boat. Every
Sunday, he takes his wife to church.
   In sharp contrast to Reagan, Bush seems to love to hold news
conferences.
   ``He is not a managed president,'' said Griscom. ``He is not
scripted out. Everything is not timed out to the half second.''
   Polls show Bush enjoys widespread public support, with job
approval ratings as high as 71 percent. ``That's higher than Reagan
at this time in his adminstration,'' says Republican pollster Linda
Divall.
   Ed Lazarus, partner in a Democratic polling and strategy
company, discounts Bush's good ratings.
   ``There is novelty to him and we always like all things that are
new,'' Lazarus said. ``There's no reason to dislike him.''
   Lazarzus said Bush runs the risk that ``he may simply become
less relevant if he goes along and doesn't do anything and the
economy starts to look shaky.''
   Cronin, the Colorado College professor, said Bush ``runs the
risk of having a very vague, very murky message and having so many
minor priorities and not being associated with any major priorities
that there is no particular theme.''
   High-ranking officials from Reagan's White House, speaking
privately, say Bush is not doing a good job projecting his goals.
   ``It's not so much that he doesn't know what he wants to do,''
one official said. ``It's how do you enunciate it. How do you lay
it out?''
   The official said the inexperience of Bush's staff was largely
to blame.
   ``Sununu is capable but who does he turn to to ask, `How does
this evolve'? That is a glaring error.''
   Democrats who were bruised by Reagan's confrontational approach
have taken a public posture of being delighted with Bush, praising
him for cooperating and trying to reestablish trust between the
White House and Congress.
   The battle over John Tower's failed nomination as secretary of
defense seems forgotten.
   ``How's he done in the first 100 days? For those of us in the
Congress who want the system to work, it's been fabulous,'' said
Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the House Democratic whip, who
cites Bush's agreements with lawmakers on a budget and Contra aid.
   ``His success can be tremendous is he keeps this up,'' Coelho
said.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., said Bush's
administration has been ``slow but steady.''
   ``In recent years,'' Foley said, ``we've gotten into kind of an
agenda-setting mood where we have to have dramatic, even theatrical
kinds of displays.'' He said that approach ``usually has less
substance that it has public relations value.''
   A onetime congressman, Bush knows how to make lamwkers happy.
   ``The great thing about this guy,'' Coelho said, ``I can call
him and in 15 minutes he calls me back.''

   White House chief of staff John Sununu says
he's learned some things about George Bush over the first 100 days
of his presidency. None seems likely to upset his boss.
   ``He's a lot tougher in the clinches. With all the respect I had
for him in the political side of the process, when it comes down to
holding firm on issues, he's a lot tougher,'' Sununu said in an
interview.
   ``He is _ more than anybody else I've seen in Washington _ less
willing to have his agenda set by the headlines of the day. I
respect that. I wasn't sure as we got to the nitty gritty how that
would go. I am amazed by that.
   ``I am amazed at how much at peace with himself he is and really
knows where he wants to go, how he wants to do it. There is a
structure and a discipline to what he wants and how he wants things
done that consistently shows day to day. I respect that. I like
that kind of an orderly approach.''
   Sununu also is an admirer of Bush's management style and shrugs
off criticism that Bush has been too cautious, reacting too much to
events instead of initiating things. ``You'll always have folks
that have grand ideas of how something ought to be done, but, with
all due respect, they're usually founded on comments shot from the
hip.''
   Speaking of Bush, Sununu said:
   ``When George Bush had to make quick decisions, you got them.
You got the savings and loan plan in two weeks. You got a budget
plan laid out on Feb. 9. You had an opportunity to get an agreement
with Congress on Central America and he took advantage of the
slightest wedge that was presented to him and came up with an
agreement with Congress in a matter or three or four weeks.
   ``Every time there's been an opportunity there, he's gone out
and jumped on it. And where opportunities do exist for considered
evaluation, you get that, too.
   ``It is someone who's got the experience and the sense enough to
know when you have to act quickly and is willing to act quickly,
the sense enough and the experience enough to know that it's just
not the right time to do something and get more information.
   ``Of all things that I think are characterized by what George
Bush has is a sense of good timing as to when a decision has to be
made. When that time comes, you get the decision.
   ``So there are some times where he wants detail, but once the
clock moves past the hour at which he thought a decision should be
made, you get the decision. And he's not going to be rushed, but
he's not going to be delayed.''

<HEAD>Speculation Grows Over Fourth Bidder for Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington property developer and a former
associate of presidents Nixon and Bush have become the latest
subjects of speculation about possible buyers for troubled Eastern
Airlines.
   Speculation intensified Thursday over a fourth possible suitor
for Eastern. Union sources said Mohamed Hadid, a real estate
investor who recently agreed to buy the Ritz-Carlton hotels in
Washington and New York, has contacted Eastern's striking unions to
express his interest.
   The federal bankruptcy court overseeing Eastern's
reorganization, which must approve any sale of the Miami-based
airline, also has been informed, said the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Speculation in other quarters pointed to Frederic V. Malek, a
former staff member in the Nixon administration and Bush
presidential campaign who is a principal of the Carlyle Group, a
Washington investment firm.
   The firm's vice chairman is former defense secretary Frank
Carlucci, who reportedly almost was chosen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland as a court-appointed trustee to oversee Eastern.
   Malek and Carlucci are among the investors buying the Coldwell
Banker commercial real-estate business from Sears, Roebuck and Co.
Malek also is part of an investor group vying for Northwest
Airlines against billionaire oilman Marvin Davis.
   Malek, former president of the Marriott Hotels division of
Marriott Corp., is a longtime Republican party activist and friend
of President Bush. He was a senior Bush operative on the Republican
National Committee, but resigned after admitting that he had
collected information on Jewish officials in the Bureau of Labor
Statistics for President Nixon in 1971.
   Malek denied that his collecting the data had anything to do
with the Jewish officials' later demotions.
   A secretary at Malek's office said he was traveling and
unavailable to comment. Ritz-Carlton managers in Washington
declined to give Hadid's telephone number and there were no phone
listings for him in that city.
   The bankruptcy examiner for Eastern, David I. Shapiro, had asked
Eastern union leaders to meet with him in New York on Thursday
evening, sources said, but it was unclear what they would discuss.
   Attorneys for Eastern and the unions recently said there are
four potentially serious suitors for the airline, which has been
grounded by a strike since March 4. It filed for bankruptcy
protection five days later.
   They said the bidders as ex-baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth, whose $464 million deal to buy Eastern collapsed last
week; takeover strategist Carl Icahn; billionaire hotel executive
Jay Pritzker; and an unnamed bidder.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp.,
insisted Wednesday that Eastern isn't for sale and that there is no
serious fourth bidder.
   Separately, the committee representing Eastern's major creditors
discussed Thursday the carrier's financial situation, sources close
to the situation said.
   In a six-hour meeting at a Manhattan law firm, representatives
of investment firm Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. presented their financial
review of Eastern to the creditors committee, said participants in
the talks, who asked not to be identified.
   ``It was nothing earth-shattering,'' one participant said.
``Everyone's sort of being held in a limbo situation.''
   Last week, shortly before the collapse of Ueberroth's deal with
Lorenzo, the creditors panel had expressed reservations about the
deal and requested that Goldman Sachs review Eastern's financial
situation.
   The creditors committee, which includes representatives of
Eastern's unions, still is waiting to hear management's plan to
sharply reduce the airline's size and sell some substantial assets.
   Eastern has not yet presented specifics of the plan to the
panel. Lorenzo said Wednesday the plan will be presented to
creditors next week.
   Lifland has ordered Eastern to explain at a hearing Monday why
the airline should not be put up for auction in its entirety.

   The man who transformed Walt Disney Co. from a
sleepy movie studio and theme-park operator into an entertainment
powerhouse was the highest-paid corporate executive last year, a
magazine reports.
   Walt Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner earned $40.1 million in
1988, Business Week said Thursday.
   Right behind him is Disney's president, Frank G. Wells, who
garnered $32.1 million, the magazine reported in its May 1 edition.
The bulk of money earned by Eisner and Wells came from stock
options they exercised.
   Business Week said the biggest surprise in its 39th annual
survey of executive pay in the United States was the average salary
and bonus for chief executive officers topped $1 million for the
first time, and the average total compensation exceeded $2 million.
   The survey of 354 corporations found the average CEO's salary
and bonus rose to nearly $1.13 million, an increase of 17 percent
over a year earlier. Stock options and long-term pay upped the
figure to more than $2.02 million, up 14 percent over a year
earlier.
   The advances far exceeded the 1988 average inflation rate of 4.4
percent.
   In the magazine's own analysis of how the CEO's performed
considering the money they make, Business Week gave the best rating
to Holly Farms Corp.'s R. Lee Taylor II, whom it said ``gets paid
chicken feed by today's standards.''
   Taylor made a total of $816,000 over the past three years for
running a company with $1.8 billion in annual sales.
   Here in descending order are the top 10 earners ranked by
Business Week in terms of 1988 total pay, which includes salary,
bonus and long-term compensation:
   Michael D. Eisner, chairman, Walt Disney, $40.09 million.
   Frank G. Wells, president, Walt Disney, $32.13 million.
   E. A. Horrigan Jr., former vice chairman, RJR Nabisco Inc.,
$21.73 million. F. Ross Johnson, former chief executive, RJR
Nabisco, $21.07 million.
   Martin S. Davis, chairman, Gulf &amp; Western Inc., $16.25 million.
   Richard L. Gelb, chairman, Bristol-Myers Co., $14.05 million.
   William P. Stiritz, chairman, Ralston Purina Co., $12.95 million.
   Baine P. Kerr, chairman, executive committee, Pennzoil Co.,
$11.55 million.
   J. Hugh Liedtke, chairman, Pennzoil, $11.54 million.
   Paul Fireman, chairman, Reebok International Ltd., $11.44
million.

   Fifty years after television's debut, a
station has demonstrated the first commercial broadcast of an
improved TV signal that could show the way for the next generation
of viewing.
   Viewers at a research center here were treated Thursday to the
first glimpse of the signal, which was used by a New York
television station to broadcast a segment of its evening news show.
   Viewers with regular televisions saw little or no difference in
the signal, but it showed up as a bright, wide picture on prototype
sets at the David Sarnoff Research Center center in this university
town about 50 miles southwest of Manhattan.
   The broadcast _ on the anniversary of television's debut at the
1939 New York World's Fair _ was another milestone on the road
toward a new generation of televisions for the 1990s, called
high-definition TV, that will have nearly the brightness and
sharpness of magazine pictures.
   Those sets may not arrive until 1994 or 1995 and initially could
cost $3,000 to $4,000, said James Tietjen, president of the
research center.
   ``Today's broadcast is to television what Kitty Hawk was to
flight,'' said Michael J. Sherlock, NBC's president for operations
and technical services.
   The broadcast by NBC's New York affiliate, WNBC-TV, is part of a
wave of experimental transmissions recently authorized by the
Federal Communications Commission.
   KHJ-TV, an independent station in Los Angeles, on Wednesday
began testing an enhancement of the standard TV signal that is
intended to remove distortions on the edges of brightly colored
objects as they appear on regular sets.
   At the end of April, KBLR in Las Vegas, Nev., is scheduled to
begin testing a different system for enhancing the signal received
by standard sets.
   In addition, more highly advanced television signals have been
transmitted over Channels 58 and 59 in Washington, D.C., which are
low-powered and exclusively for research purposes.
   WNBC-TV, however, is the only commercial station that is
transmitting a signal that can be displayed on special wide screens
that have the proportions of a movie theater screen.
   The system falls short of full-fledged, high-definition
television because it has to fit into the same narrow portion of
the broadcast spectrum as the regular television signal does.
   Engineers say full HDTV will require at least 50 percent more
band width than regular channels provide.
   Thursday's test was part of a six-year, $60 million research
effort at the Sarnoff center that is supported by NBC; NBC's local
affiliates; NBC's parent, General Electric Co.; and RCA Consumer
Electronics, which is owned by France's Thomson SA.
   At one time, RCA, NBC and the Sarnoff center were all under the
same ownership. The research center now is operated by SRI
International, a Menlo Park, Calif., non-profit research concern.
   The advanced TV demonstration shown during the news program
``Live at Five'' was a videotape from the Tournament of Roses
parade that had been recorded on a special video camera.
   It was encoded, transmitted from the top of New York's World
Trade Cneter and then decoded by the prototype equipment in
Princeton.
   WNBC had been quietly testing the system during the early
morning hours since March 12, according to James Carnes, the
Sarnoff center's vice president for the consumer electronics and
information sciences division.
   Fifty years ago to the day Thursday, Gen. David Sarnoff,
then-chairman of the Radio Corp. of America, the former RCA,
introduced television at the New York World's Fair.
   The wider, sharper picture is squeezed into a standard channel
with computer techniques. The extra side panels are compressed so
they appear on regular sets as invisibly thin lines along the
edges. The experimental sets decompress those panels to fill up the
wider screen.
   Extra detail for the side panels and for the entire picture is
transmitted in unused spaces in the signal.
   ``When we started this program five years ago, 90 percent of the
scientists in this industry would have said, `Forget it, this can't
be done.' But we did it,'' said Steven Bonica, a vice president for
engineering at NBC.

<HEAD>Northwest Urges Shareholders To Wait Before Tendering To Davis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARREN MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, is
urging its shareholders to wait for the advice of its board of
directors before deciding whether to sell shares to Marvin Davis,
who is appealing to them with a hostile tender offer.
   But it would seem unlikely that Davis would have many takers at
$90 a share as long as the stock continues to command a higher
price on the New York Stock Exchange. Davis' offer, announced
Thursday, is the same price he offered the board late last month in
proposing a negotiated deal.
   The board rejected the offer as inadequate. The company said it
preferred all-cash, fully financed offers, and Davis apparently
sought to meet that requirement.
   On Thursday, NWA stock closed at $98.87{, down 62{ cents from
Wednesday's record-high of $99.50, on volume of 1.57 million shares.
   It was the third day of heavy trading in the stock since the NWA
board said Monday it would consider all serious offers for the
airline, the nation's fourth-largest. Alternatively, it said it
would consider selling part of the airline, buying back shares,
buying another company or issuing a special dividend to
shareholders.
   Northwest, based in suburban Eagan, released a statement
Thursday telling shareholders that the NWA board will review the
tender offer and make a recommendation to them no later than April
30.
   ``We are studying Mr. Davis' actions,'' Kevin Whalen, NWA's
director of corporate communications, said of the hostile takeover
bid.
   The $2.7 billion tender offer by Davis Acquisition Inc. will
expire at midnight EDT on May 17 unless extended.
   Including related fees, the deal could total $3.1 billion, the
Davis group said. The group owns 850,000 shares of NWA common
stock, or about 2.8 percent of the total outstanding.
   ``It should be absolutely clear: We do not intend to `bust up'
the company,'' Davis said in a statement. ``Our financing
arrangements will not necessitate the sale of any of NWA's airline
assets, and will ... allow the expansion of the airline and the
fulfillment of its capital expenditure plans.''
   In a letter to NWA's board, Davis Acquisition reaffirmed its
willingness to negotiate all aspects of the offer, including price.
   ``We hope that the NWA board of directors will determine to
pursue the sale of the company, rather than the other alternatives
listed in its recent announcement,'' Davis said.
   ``Since NWA apparently will give serious consideration to the
other, non-sale alternatives, we have determined to bring our offer
directly to the stockholders,'' he added.
   Davis Acquisition said it has obtained a letter from Citibank
and Citicorp North America Inc. stating they would syndicate with a
group of major banks up to $1.4 billion of financing for the offer,
with Citibank committed to lending up to $500 milion of the amount
itself.
   The company said it hoped to obtain other financing, including
an arrangement of up to $1.25 billion of preferred stock financing
by Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   In addition, $300 million in common equity would be contributed
by a Davis family partnership, with the partnership committed to
purchase an additional $150 million of junior preferred stock.
   State officials have led a campaign to stop a takeover of
Northwest, fearing it would lead to the sale of Northwest assets
and a loss of jobs.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was mixed in early European
trading today as foreign currency dealers assessed the impact of
Thursday's unexpected interest rate hike in West Germany. Gold
prices rose.
   Dealers said the market had calmed down after late Thursday's
hectic trading following the Deutsche Bundesbank's announcement it
was raising key interest rates by half a percentage point.
   ``It's quiet today,'' said Ernst Pullman, chief trader at
Deutsche Girozentrale in Frankfurt. ``People were expecting the
Japanese to raise their interest rates, but it looks like that's
not going to happen right away.''
   Earlier today, Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama said
the Bank of Japan has no plans to raise interest rates and that he
doesn't think an increase is needed.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.83 yen to a closing 131.45 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 131.08 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8458 West German marks, up from 1.8450
   _1.6320 Swiss francs, up from 1.6275
   _6.2590 French francs, down from 6.2925
   _2.0835 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0990
   _1,357.75 Italian lire, down from 1,361.50
   _1.1840 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7185, slightly more
expensive for buyers than late Thursday's $1.7115.
   Gold prices rose in quiet European dealings as bullion dealers
awaited developments in oil prices and in the dollar before acting
more decisively. Soaring oil prices and a sinking dollar on
Thursday gave the recently sluggish precious metal a healthy kick
higher.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $385.50 a troy ounce, up
from $383.25 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $385.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $385, up from $382.70 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 96 cents to close at a bid
$386.41.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.79 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $5.76.

<HEAD>First-Quarter Earnings At GM Up 42.2 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s 42.2 percent first-quarter
profit surge may not be sustainable, especially when the newest
incentive package takes its toll, analysts say.
   GM reported Thursday that it earned $1.55 billion, or $2.37 a
share, in the first three months of this year, compared with $1.09
billion, or $1.56 a share, in the same 1988 period.
   Revenue rose 11.9 percent to $29.6 billion from $26.4 billion.
The nation's largest automaker said profits rose because of
stronger performance in North America and an ongoing cost-saving
program.
   ``Really, what distinguished the first quarter is that sales
were not great, but they have structured themselves that they can
make a lot of money at lower sales levels,'' said auto analyst
Jeannette Garretty of the Bank of America in San Francisco.
   ``The quarter-over-quarter difference is most dramatic in the
North American (operations),'' she said.
   But Garretty added she doubted GM could continue its
first-quarter earnings pace, especially as the costs of an
incentive program GM announced March 30 begin to take hold.
   ``I think it's seriously doubtful that (incentives) will
generate enough sales to offset the cost of incentives,'' Garretty
said.
   During the first three months of this year, GM's car and light
truck sales ran 12.1 percent lower than the same time last year,
the second best year in industry history.
   Partly because of lower-than-expected sales, GM announced a new
incentive package on March 30. The package expires June 5.
   Incentives, which can boost sales on a short-term basis, are
costly for automakers, since they assume nearly all financing, with
dealers contributing only a fraction of the total cost.
   Earnings and revenue figures for 1988 reflect an accounting
change GM exercised Jan. 1, 1988. The per-share earnings for both
periods reflect a 2-for-1 stock split effective March 31.
   The company said its North American operations, which had been
lagging recently, contributed significantly to first-quarter
profits. GM also said its overseas earnings during the first
quarter this year exceeded last year's record first-quarter profits.
   GM spokesman Terry Sullivan declined to provide specific numbers
or approximations about GM's North American automotive operations,
other than to say ``they were profitable and up from last year.''
   The company said it cut costs by about $1 billion in the first
quarter. That brings to $9.5 billion the amount GM said it has cut
in a program aimed at slashing $12.5 billion to $13 billion by the
end of 1990.
   Ford is expected to release its first-quarter earnings report
next week and Chrysler in the first week of May.

<HEAD>MCA Tries To Block Cineplex Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. entertainment giant MCA Inc. has won the
preliminary court support in a battle to stop a group led by
Cineplex Odeon Corp. from locking up control of the U.S. and
Canadian movie house chain.
   The Ontario Supreme Court issued an interim injunction
prohibiting the group from acquiring shares in the Toronto-based
company from sellers led by Montreal financier Charles Bronfman,
MCA said Thursday in a statement.
   Cineplex Chairman Garth Drabinsky and his allies cannot buy
``until further order,'' the court said.
   Officials of Los Angeles-based MCA, the biggest single
shareholder in Cineplex, and Drabinsky could not be reached for
comment. The court order came on the eve of a Quebec Securities
Commission hearing on the issue.
   At the hearing Friday, MCA will seek to block the plans of
Drabinsky and his allies to buy a 30 percent chunk of Cineplex
stock from the Bronfman group in a $127-million private deal
announced last week. Bronfman is co-chairman of the Seagram Co. Ltd.
   In documents MCA filed Thursday with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission in Washington, the company said it might take
other steps ``to impede'' Drabinsky from winning control of
Cineplex.
   In one of the documents _ a letter to Drabinsky and all Cineplex
board members _ MCA called on the Cineplex board to set up a
committee of the independent directors to rule on the Drabinsky
group's bid and, if necessary, suggest alternatives.
   Drabinsky's group has said it would settle for 5.9 million
shares instead of the 7.3 million announced last week. That would
leave them with 34.2 percent of the votes, putting them ahead of
MCA.
   Because of Canadian restrictions on foreign ownership imposed
when MCA acquired its 49.6 percent stake in Cineplex in 1986, the
U.S. company can exercise only one-third of the votes in the
company minus one share.
   MCA wants the Quebec securities watchdog to refuse to grant the
exemption the Drabinsky group is seeking from having to make a
comparable $17.50-a-share offer to other Cineplex shareholders.

   The former president of American Express Carte
France was arrested and charged with drug-related offenses two days
after the company announced he was being replaced, the company said
Friday.
   Hector Cuellar has taken a leave of absence pending completion
of a police investigation, said Gerard Dijoud, spokesman for
American Express Travel Related Services in France.
   Cuellar, 50, an American of Colombian origin, was detained for
questioning April 13 at Charles de Gaulle airport following the
October drug smuggling arrest of a man with alleged ties to him,
the French news agency Agence France-Presse reported Thursday.
   On April 11, the French subsidiary of American Express Co.,
announced that Cuellar would be replaced by Charles Petrucelli, a
senior vice-president of American Express in the United States. The
change was to be effective May 15.
   The announcement said the changes were being made as part of a
management structuring plan initiated by Cuellar.
   French drug agents, in collaboration with the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency, learned that Cuellar allegedly had ties to
Roland Badier, who was arrested on his return from Colombia October
13 carrying cocaine paste, AFP reported, quoting unidentified
sources.
   The news agency said Badier had documents showing ''proof'' of
his ties to Cuellar.
   AFP reported that investigators believe Cuellar allegedly may
have received money from Badier then transferred it to the account
of a third person, a Colombian stockbroker implicated in the United
States in cocaine smuggling and money laundering schemes.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Agrees to Buy 10 Radio Stations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. Inc. has
tentatively agreed to buy the 10 Metropolitan-Legacy radio stations
in a deal that it said would create the nation's second-largest
radio station group.
   Westinghouse Broadcasting, which is also known as Group W,
already owns 14 radio stations: 8 AM stations and 6 FM stations.
   ``With this one agreement, the company that inaugurated radio
broadcasting in America in 1920 will dramatically increase its base
of operations, which will insure that Westinghouse will remain the
first name in radio on into the next century,'' Richard Harris,
Group W Radio chairman, said in a statement Thursday.
   Terms of the purchase were not disclosed, but one condition of
the proposed agreement called for repayment of the outstanding debt
of Legacy Broadcasting and Metropolitan Broadcasting for no more
than $135 million.
   The New York Times reported today that the sale was believed to
be worth about $385 million, making it the largest radio deal ever.
   New York-based Westinghouse Broadcasting said it had signed a
letter of intent to buy AM and FM stations in Washington, Houston
and Minneapolis and FM stations in New York, Los Angeles, Detroit
and Philadelphia.
   It said the deal is subject to reaching a definitive agreement
as well as approval by the appropriate boards of directors and
government regulators.
   If the deal were completed, Westinghouse said it would be
required by Federal Communications Commission rules to sell one of
the two Houston FM stations that it would then own. It said it
would seek a waiver of FCC rules so that it could operate the FM
station in Philadelphia, where it already owns an AM station and a
television station.
   Westinghouse said the deal would create a radio station group
second only to Capital Cities-ABC Inc.'s ABC Radio Station Group in
annual sales.
   The top officials of the Metropolitan Legacy stations are
Chairman Robert F.X. Sillerman and Vice Chairman Carl E. Hirsh.
   The statement said Sillerman, a veteran broadcaster, would
retain a minority interest in Group W Radio under terms of the deal.
   Burton B. Staniar, chairman of Westinghouse Broadcasting, said
the transaction would strengthen Group W's ability to serve several
local communities and give it a presence in nine of the top 10 U.S.
markets.
   He said it would also provide ``important new sales synergies''
for Group W that could offer advertisers combination buys of AM and
FM stations in a number of cities.
   The stations that would be acquired are WNEW-FM, New York;
KTWV-FM, Los Angeles; WMMR-FM, Philadelphia; WCXR-FM and WCPT-AM,
Washington, D.C.; WLLZ-FM, Detroit; KILT-AM and KILT-FM, Houston;
and KDWB-AM and KDWB-FM, Minneapolis.
   Group W already owns WBZ-AM, Boston; WINS-AM, New York; KYW-AM,
Philadelphia; KDKA-AM, Pittsburgh; WMAQ-AM, Chicago; KODA-FM,
Houston; KQZY-FM, Dallas-Fort Worth; KQXT-FM, San Antonio; KMEO-AM
and KMEO-FM, Phoenix; KFWB-AM, Los Angeles; KFBK-AM and KAER-FM,
Sacramento; and KJQY-FM, San Diego.
   Westinghouse Broadcasting is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Westinghouse Electric Corp., based in Pittsburgh.

   Carolco Pictures Inc., maker of the Rambo

Group Inc. for more than $25 million.
   The agreement has been approved by the De Laurentiis board and a
creditors committee appointed by U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the company

   Carolco will pay more than $25 million for a De Laurentiis
studio in Wilmington, N.C., and a 350-movie library that includes
such titles as ``Crimes of the Heart'' and ``Serpico,'' as well as
an interest in the reorganized company.
   De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, founded by Italian director
Dino De Laurentiis, filed for federal bankruptcy protection from
its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law last
August.
   A reorganization plan must be approved by the bankruptcy court.

   Sharon Steel Corp.'s executive vice
president has been appointed chief operating officer of the
financially troubled company.
   A bankruptcy court-appointed trustee on Thursday placed E.
Leonard Kern in charge of day-to-day operations at the company's
lone steel plant, located in Mercer County.
   Trustee William Agnew said Kern ``brings back to Sharon the
knowledge, skills and tenacity to assist the company in its quest
to complete a successful reorganization under Chapter 11.''
   Kern replaces Walter Sieckman, who was moved to vice chairman as
an adviser to Agnew.
   Agnew recently said Sharon's 1988 operating profit of $23.5
million is not enough to sustain a company of its size. ``It's
better than not having made anything, but it's not good enough to
make the company viable,'' he said.
   Sharon reported a net loss of $40 million for 1988. It lost
$19.6 million on operations in 1987 and $21.1 million in 1986.
   Kern joined Sharon Steel in 1969 as general superintendent of
iron and steel operations.

<HEAD>Government Gives Conditional Clearance To $2.9 Billion Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain on Friday conditionally approved the joint
$2.9 billion bid for Plessey Co. by Siemens AG of West Germany and
General Electric Co. PLC of Britain.
   Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unanimously decided
that the acquisition of the British electronics company should be
allowed to proceed, provided that the buyers pledge to resolve some
competition concerns.
   Earlier this week, the European Commission said it would clear
the hostile bid for Plessey because it ``had come to the conclusion
that the proposed arrangements do not raise objections'' to EC
competition rules.
   Plessey said it would continue to fight the takeover.
   The British commission said that in connection with GEC it found
that the merger raised competition concerns in defense radar,
military communications and traffic-control equipment.
   In addition, the commission found that a merger raised concerns
for competition in a large defense avionics project called JTIDS.
The commission said there were ``potential conflicts with national
security requirements'' because Siemens isn't a British-owned
company.
   The joint bid for Plessey values each Plessey share at $3.85,
making the total bid worth $2.9 billion.
   GEC and Plessey had no immediate comment on the commission's
findings.
   In February, GEC and Siemens revised their takeover plans for
running Plessey's politically sensitive defense-contracting
business in an effort to appease British defense and antitrust
officials.
   The commission said it would obtain commitments from GEC and
Siemens they won't acquire any interest in or influence or control
over the management of Plessey's radar and military communications
businesses and Plessey's traffic control activities.
   In addition, GEC and Siemens must ensure that access to
technology and licenses for production of JTIDS equipment are made
available to any competitor nominated by the British Ministry of
Defense.
   In order to comply with national security requirements,
arrangements for ownership and management of Plessey's defense,
research and development, and semiconductors businesses will need
approval of Trade Secretary Lord Young.
   Young asked GEC and Siemens for assurances as soon as possible
and said the proposed acquisition shouldn't proceed until they are
received.

   Tighter Pentagon budgets mean defense contractors
are facing tough times in the short term, Texas Instruments Inc.
executives said in reporting a first-quarter earnings decline.
   ``We are very optimistic about the future of our defense
electronics business in the next decade,'' Chairman Jerry R.
Junkins told shareholders Thursday. ``But we must be realistic
about the near-term environment.
   ``It's going to be a tougher period for defense contractors in
general, and it means lower near-term growth in our business,'' he
said.
   Dallas-based Texas Instruments provides various electronic,
missile and radar systems for the Army, Navy and Air Force and
recently won contracts that could bring the company as much as $11
billion in revenue over the several-year life of the deal.
   But the company on Thursday reported slightly lower earnings for
the first three months of this year, in part because defense
revenues were down 5 percent from the comparable 1988 quarter.
   The company said it had net income of $84.6 million, or 90 cents
a share, on sales of $1.56 billion in the first three months of the
year.
   That compares to $85.5 million, or 95 cents a share, on sales of
$1.47 billion in the same 1988 period. The company said the lower
per-share earnings were due to increased dividends paid on
preferred stock.
   Junkins told analysts not to base their conclusions about the
company's defense business on a quarter-to-quarter comparison
because of the long-term payback of some of the ongoing research
projects.
   Texas Instruments said it will spend more than $1 billion on
research and development and capital expansion during this year.
   Junkins said the company will spend $525 million on research and
development and $760 million in capital expenditures; $127 million
was spent in the first quarter on research and another $150 million
on capital projects.
   Chief Financial Officer William Aylesworth said the research
will focus on improvements in logic devices on the semiconductor
side and in improving radar technology for defense systems.
   Texas Instrument, which had 1988 earnings of $366.3 million on
sales of $6.29 billion, is a major manufacturer of semiconductors.
Besides defense electronic systems, its businesses include computer
systems, various electrical systems and consumer electronics
products.

<HEAD>Rates Continue To Rise in Europe; Dollar Mixed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German central bank today raised rates on short-term
treasury notes a day after its surprise hike in the discount rate,
a move that rattled U.S. financial markets.
   Separately, the central bank in Belgium raised interest on five
key lending rates, mirroring Thursday's moves by West Germany's
Bundesbank as well as rate increases announced by the central banks
of Austria and Denmark.
   The Bundesbank's initial actions jolted financial markets in the
United States, where Wall Street suffered a selloff, bond prices
slipped and the dollar lost substantial ground.
   In early trading today, however, the dollar was mixed and bond
prices were holding firm. Traders continued to look for indications
as to whether Britain and Japan would follow with rate increases of
their own.
   Analysts said they expected the Dow Jones industrial average,
which lost nearly 10 points on Thursday, to bounce back.
   The unsettling of financial markets began when the Bundesbank
raised West Germany's discount rate to 4.5 percent from 4.0 percent
and the Lombard rate _the effective ceiling on overnight loans
between banks _ to 6.5 percent from 6.0 percent.
   Today the central bank set short-term Treasury note rates at 5.0
percent, up from 4.5 percent effective immediately. A Bundesbank
spokesman said the rate on the notes, whose maturity is between 3
and 4 days, usually is set in accordance with the discount rate.
   Domestic overnight rates also rose.
   A dealer at a major West German bank said the market is ``all
confused and nervous'' following the unexpected shift in the rates.
Although market liquidity remains sufficient, he said there were
``too many question marks about the Bundesbank's behavior, which
made short-term rates unstable.''
   Belgium's National Bank said it was raising its discount and
Lombard rates by a half a percentage point each as well as hiking
rates on Treasury bills following ``changes in interest rates
abroad.'' Belgium usually follows changes in interest rates in West
Germany, a key trading partner.
   The new discount rate takes effect Monday. The other rates took
effect today.

<HEAD>Colgate-Palmolive Profit Growth 2.8 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s income rose 2.8 percent
in the first quarter, with much of the earnings growth coming from
its European and pet foods divisions, the company said.
   The big household and consumer products company Thursday
reported after-tax profit of $67.2 million, or 98 cents a share, up
from $65.4 million, or 96 cents a share, in 1988's first quarter,
which included $13.8 million from discontinued operations.
   Excluding that gain, earnings from continuing operations went up
30.3 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.
   Last year's first-quarter included a financial contribution from
Kendall health care, which Colgate sold in 1988 as part of its
strategy to focus on its consumer products businesses.
   Sales totaled $1.20 billion in the three months ended March 31,
compared with $1.14 billion a year earlier.
   Colgate Chairman Reuben Mark said the improvement in
profitability occurred as the net return on sales, considered a key
measurement of financial performance, reached its highest level in
more than 25 years.
   The return on sales, after taxes, was 5.6 percent vs. 4.5
percent in the first quarter of 1988.
   ``I am pleased to see that after we consciously slowed worldwide
volume growth last year by focusing only on more profitable sales,
our first quarter volume growth has accelerated again, but on a
considerably more profitable basis,'' said Mark, who also is
Colgate's president and chief executive officer.
   Colgate sells its products in more than 100 countries and some
of its brands are Palmolive and Irish Spring soaps, Ajax cleanser
and Hill's pet foods.

   The Coca-Cola Co. would acquire at least 41
percent of a major Australian food and tobacco company, AMATIL
Ltd., under a reorganization plan announced today.
   The deal has been approved by the boards of Coke, AMATIL and
B.A.T. Industries, which is AMATIL's largest shareholder, but is
subject to the approval of AMATIL shareholders and Australian
regulatory authorities.
   Financial terms of the proposal were not disclosed.
   Under the proposed reorganization, AMATIL would concentrate on
its core business of snack foods and soft drinks and would spin off
its tobacco interests into a new company.
   AMATIL is one of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers in the world and
one of Australia's largest companies.
   Coke Chairman Roberto C. Goizueta said the deal reflects
Coca-Cola's commitment to the international market.
   ``AMATIL's excellent track record, the vitality of the
Australian market and our success in similar equity ventures in
other parts of the world made us eager to support AMATIL in this
new organizational structure,'' he said.

<UNK>Eastern To Add Four Flights From Atlanta</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strike-crippled Eastern Airlines has announced
one-way $59 bargain fares on four new flights from Atlanta to New
York, Miami and Washington, D.C., starting May 1.
   The new flights will bring the number of daily Eastern flights
out of Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport to five, compared
to nearly 300 daily before the March 4 walkout by the airline's
Machinists, pilots and flight attendants.
   The flights, announced Thursday, include one daily round-trip
each to Washington and Miami and two daily round-trip flights to
New York's LaGuardia Airport, Eastern spokeswoman Karen M. Ceremsak
said.
   The flights will have one-way unrestricted fares of $59.
   The new flights will begin the same day that Continental
Airlines, which like Eastern is a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp.,
plans to start four daily flights between Atlanta and Newark, N.J.
   Eastern canceled all operations at Hartsfield, once its busiest
hub, after the strike began. A single daily flight between Atlanta
and Miami was added April 2.
   Delta Air Lines has not decided whether it will match Eastern's
bargain fares on the four new Atlanta flights, Delta spokesman Jim
Lundy said. ``Over the next day or two, we'll be taking a look at
it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Corporate takeover artist T. Boone Pickens has
raided Japan, leaving business leaders suspicious and wondering
whether Americans like him want to buy their companies just as the
Japanese have done in the United States.
   However, the difficulties the Texas oilman has encountered with
the subtleties and intricacies of Japanese business suggest Pickens
himself is far from being a threat to Japan's leading companies.
   Pickens has purchased shares worth about $1 billion in Koito
Manufacturing Co., a major auto parts maker, surpassing Toyota
Motor to become the largest shareholder. But despite owning 20.2
percent of Koito, its management politely turned down Pickens'
request this week for a seat on the board of directors.
   ``It is necessary to build a trusting relationship first. In
Japan, it is not possible to just say, `I'm a major shareholder'
and get a seat on the board right away,'' Koito director Tamotsu
Aoyama told a news conference Thursday.
   Pickens, in his first visit to Tokyo, challenged what analysts
consider two central tenets of Japanese business culture: that a
company belongs to its employees, not its shareholders; and that
the Japanese market is for Japanese, not foreigners, to enjoy.
   Pickens argued in a speech that protecting shareholders' rights
by using corporate buyouts to oust incompetent management helped
resuscitate the U.S. economy over the last nine years.
   ``What happened in the U.S. in the 1980s will find its way to
the Japanese business community in the 1990s,'' he predicted.
   But many Japanese businessmen hope that will not happen. These
businessmen believe the American emphasis on return to shareholders
has caused U.S. companies to lose competitiveness to Japanese
companies.
   ``Japanese companies don't generally have to answer to
shareholders with short-term profits. They can focus on longer-term
growth,'' said Keith Donaldson, an analyst at James Capel Pacific,
Ltd. ``Just look at these two economies to see which approach has
been more successful.''
   But even if Japan doesn't like Pickens' advice, it can't afford
to ignore him because he tied his shareholders' crusade to trade
issues.
   Pickens told reporters that ``people in Washington are watching
carefully'' whether he is able to invest in Japan. He said he was
``concerned that American investors don't have the same access in
Japan as Japanese have in the U.S.''
   While Japanese companies have invested billions of dollars in
the United States, some of it actively wooed by American states
eager for jobs, U.S. companies find it very difficult to invest in
Japan, analysts said.
   However, companies such as Federal Express have broken into
fast-growing Japanese markets by purchasing stakes in Japanese
companies in the same line of business, working hard to establish
themselves by putting down local roots.
   But many Japanese perceive Pickens as making an attempt at
greenmail _ taking a company hostage with the intention of selling
it at a profit rather than managing it for the long run.
   ``This is a bad example of an American acquisition _ a
`corporate activist' with no expertise in the business buying up
shares in a company,'' said Yoshihisa Murasawa, a consultant with
Booz Allen Hamilton (Japan) Inc.
   Mergers and acquisitions have shown signs of picking up. The
number of securities firms have been reduced through such tactics
from 600 a decade ago to 250 today, Murasawa said.
   But he said Japanese lack ``a habit of buying and selling
companies.''
   ``It's even harder for a Japanese company than an American to
acquire another. ... Selling companies is seen as something like
selling family.''

   Events in the North Sea and Alaska are diverting
the oil market's attention from factors that normally would be
driving prices down, analysts said as crude leaped another $2 a
barrel.
   Meanwhile, officials of Shell U.K. Ltd., operator of a platform
that exploded in the North Sea this week, said Thursday that
inspection of the damage is continuing but declined to say when
normal operations would resume.
   The gas explosion at the Cormorant Alpha platform Tuesday halted
production of nearly 500,000 barrels of oil _ or one-quarter of
total production _ from the Brent oil fields.
   Crude prices have surged more than $3 a barrel, or almost 15
percent, since the accident.
   ``With Brent being a major crude, it has people scared,'' said
Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc. ``It's
possible there won't be any May deliveries.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, soared $2.04
to finish at $24.65 a barrel, the highest level in more than three
years. The last time the near-month contract was higher was on Jan.
15, 1986.
   The $2.04 rise topped a $1.74 hike on Aug. 4, 1986, to become
the largest one-day increase since trading of crude futures began
on the New York Mercantile Exchange in March 1983.
   Beutel said that buyers anxious to take positions on the May
contract before it expired Thursday also drove prices higher.
   In early trading today, the June contract opened lower then
rebounded slightly after closing at $21.28 on Thursday. The
contract was trading between $20.93 and $21.33 a barrel before
midday EDT.
   Because gasoline prices have already increased in recent weeks
in response to the Alaskan oil spill, the latest jump in crude
prices may have only a minimal impact at the consumer level, unless
the pipeline shutdown is prolonged, analysts said.
   Thursday's frenzied buying was triggered by a comment from
British Energy Minister Cecil Parkinson that the oil field shutdown
could last up to a month.
   The closure affects several major oil companies that pump oil
through the station. Those include Exxon Corp., with about 85,000
barrels a day shut in, Amoco Corp., with 10,000, and Conoco Inc.,
with 24,000.
   Analysts said factors that normally would have driven prices
down during this period _ overproduction by OPEC and a softening in
demand during the second quarter _ had been pushed to the
background.
   But once North Sea operations return to normal and as the
Alaskan spill fades from people's minds, prices could fall back
below $20 a barrel, they said.
   ``The market is so overbought due to the psychological impact of
these events that there's a lot of room for a fall in prices,''
said Ken Miller, an analyst with the petroleum consulting firm of
Purvin &amp; Gertz Inc. ``The fundamentals don't support the prices.''
   Among refined-product trading Thursday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the price of unleaded gasoline for May
delivery rose 0.03 cent to 74.64 cents a gallon, while the May
heating oil contract fell 1.04 cents to 52.29 cents a gallon.
   Despite the recent accidents, an actual shortage of oil or
gasoline is more anticipation than reality, market observers said.
   The Department of Energy recently revised its figures to show
that demand is actually lower than thought. And OPEC is believed to
be producing more than 20.5 million barrels of oil a day, 2 million
barrels above its self-imposed quota and about a million barrels
more than needed to meet demand.
   So while the North Sea and Alaska problems have caused temporary
disruptions, there is no evidence of a shortage of oil and gasoline
to meet current world demand, analysts said.

<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, whose
Eastern Airlines is in bankruptcy protection, sought the wisdom of
Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca, who years ago helped turn
around the struggling automaker, a Chrysler spokesman said.
   Lorenzo, who put Eastern into bankruptcy reorganization March 9,
asked for advice on a walkout by Eastern's unions that virtually
has shut down the Miami-based carrier, Chrysler spokesman John
Guiniven said Thursday.
   ``Lorenzo's company and its employees are going through rough
times,'' Guiniven said. ``Chrysler and its employees, as everyone
knows, also went through rough times. Chrysler is probably the
country's prime example of bouncing back.''
   Upon his arrival Thursday at Detroit Metropolitan Airport,
Lorenzo was met by striking Eastern employees who had been tipped
to his visit. They chanted and booed as he stepped off the plane.
   Guiniven said he didn't know exactly what Iacocca told Lorenzo
in their meeting at Chrysler headquarters in Highland Park, Mich.
Lorenzo, a friend of Iacocca's for a number of years, didn't seek
financial assistance, nor did the two executives discuss a sale of
the airline, Guiniven said.
   Lorenzo has said he intends to reorganize Eastern, a subsidiary
of Texas Air, as a smaller airline. A deal to sell the carrier to a
group led by former baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth
recently fell through.
   Tom Barker, leader of 37 striking Detroit machinists, said he
learned Lorenzo was coming about 10 minutes in advance and formed a
reception committee. He said some passengers on Lorenzo's flight
chanted along with the strikers as Lorenzo got off the plane.

   The stock market turned upward today, resuming
the rally that carried it to 18-month highs earlier in the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.78 to 2,384.16 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 696 up, 446 down and
562 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 58.20 million shares at
midmorning.
   The market suffered a temporary setback Thursday when the West
German central bank announced unexpected increases in its official
interest rates.
   That raised fears of downward pressure on the dollar, and of
possible further credit-tightening in this country.
   By today, however, analysts said investors seemed to be taking
the view that the Federal Reserve would wait a while longer to
gauge the effects of the restrictive moves it has already made over
the past year or so.
   Thus, observers noted, the possibility remained open in many
minds that interest rates are close to or at a peak.
   Perkin-Elmer climbed 1} to 24~ in active trading. The company
announced plans to sell some of its operations and pass the
proceeds to shareholders in the form of dividends, stock
repurchases or a combination of the two.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .54 to 171.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .90 at 342.23.

   Borden Inc. on Friday reported a 12.7 percent
jump in first-quarter profits despite a decline in the food and
consumer products company's dairy division.
   For the quarter ended March 31, Borden said net income totaled
$59.0 million, or 80 cents a share, up from $52.4 million, or 71
cents a share in the year-ago first quarter.
   Net sales during the period rose 12.6 percent to $1.8 billion,
from $1.6 billion a year ago.
   The snacks and international consumer products division posted
the greatest gain, with operating income up 26.5 percent. Operating
income from the worldwide packaging and industrial products
division rose 21.5 percent based on income gains from the sales of
forest products adhesives, industrial resins and specialty coatings.
   Borden's grocery and specialty products division reported a 13
percent rise in operating income during the quarter, boosted by
sales of Creamette and other regional pasta brands, Krylon spray
paint and Elmer's glue.
   Those gains worked to offset a 36 percent decline in operating
income posted by the dairy division, which Borden said was hit by
continued increases in raw milk costs and tougher competition that
that worked to drive down profit margins.
   In remarks to be delivered at the company's annual meeting
Friday in Flemington, N.J., Borden Chairman R.J. Ventres noted that
the company is ``just beginning'' to turn around the troubled dairy
division. Since July the company has eliminated 15 plants and
consolidated production in an effort to cut costs.
   Further, ``we are intensifying our investment in long-term brand
growth through advertising, and in the development of more products
to serve the fast-growing side of the diary business: products
lower in fats and calories.''
   Ventres noted Borden's goal of becoming a $10 billion company by
1991 with 60 brands that are either first or second in their
product categories.

   A tank ruptured and spilled at least
180,000 gallons of oily waste water into Grand River today as a
barge was being unloaded at a waste disposal site in southern
Louisiana, authorities said.
   The tank on the barge was carrying 900,000 gallons of
non-hazardous oily waste from the Exxon-Houston facility for
disposal by GSX Land Treatment of White Castle, state police said.
   ``Environmental officials from Exxon tell us that the material
is about 90 percent water, 7 percent alcohol and 3 percent oil,''
said Lt. Ronnie Jones of the state police.
   No one was injured, Jones said.
   The spill happened at a remote area about 35 miles southwest of
Baton Rouge on the edge of the Atchafalaya Basin, a vast hardwood
swamp and marshland that is a breeding ground for a variety of fish
and wildlife.
   The barge is owned by Palmer Co. of Port Arthur, Texas, and
leased by GSX. Exxon had no responsibility for the barge after it
left the Texas site, said Freddie Pitre, sheriff of Iberville
Parish.
   ``We were unloading the waste when the barge buckled. An unknown
quantity spilled into Grand River. We haven't determined the
cause,'' said Bobby Mayweather, manager of environmental safety for
GSX. ``We had unloaded 260,000 gallons and we believe about 180,000
gallons spilled.''
   State police estimated the spill at between 300,000 and 400,000
gallons.
   Jones said crews quickly surrounded the spill with booms,
adding, ``We believe we've got most of the material contained in
one area.''
   Mayweather said that the remainder of the waste will be emptied
into tanker trucks later today. Paul Dubois, a spokesman for the
Palmer Co., said a water and alcohol mixture, commonly known in the
oil industry as ``slop water,'' is used to wash out tanks and
ships. When it's dirty with oil residue, it becomes waste water, he
said.
   John Reidy, a spokesman for Exxon, said officials at their New
Orleans headquarters had little information about the spill, but
would have a statement as soon as possible.
   Jones said there is little chance of fire or explosion, but
``from an environmental standpoint, this could be a dangerous
spill. Anytime you get 400,000 gallons of anything into a river,
you've got a serious situation.''
   The incident comes four weeks after an Exxon oil tanker hit a
reef and ruptured in the waters off Alaska, spewing 10 million
gallons of crude oil, the worst oil spill in U.S. history.
   After today's spill, Exxon dispatched a cleanup crew from New
Orleans. The Department of Environmental Quality and other state
agencies were also sent to the site, Jones said.
   Stanley Jackson of the Office of Emergency Preparedness for
Iberville Parish, said, ``It doesn't seem that bad, and it's not a
significant spill, but you can't convince the people around here of
that.''
   The tank ruptured about 4 a.m. The barge was carrying three
tanks of the waste, Jones said. Workers removed the tanks from both
ends of the barge, causing the barge to buckle and rupture the
middle tank, Jones said.
   At sunup, the alcohol was evaporating, Jones said, leaving only
the oil to be cleaned up. If the waste is 3 percent oil, 180,000
gallons of waste would contain 5,600 gallons of oil, while 300,000
to 400,000 gallons would include 9,000 to 12,000 gallons of oil.
   Jones said the spill left no visible sheen on the water because
the material was so thoroughly emulsified _ ``more mixed up, that
is, with water and air and bubbles.''
   ``The Grand is a slow-moving river, so there has not been a
tremendous amount of movement of the material,'' Jones said.

<HEAD>Soybeans Up Sharply On Weather, European Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged in early trading
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting strong European
demand for soybean meal and reduced prospects for rain in the
Midwest next week.
   Corn futures were moderately higher in early trading and wheat
futures were up slightly.
   The firming of European soybean meal markets turned up the heat
on simmering fears of tight U.S. soybean supplies, which are at
relatively low levels as a result of last summer's drought.
   The possibility of a second drought year is keeping the soybean
and corn markets on edge, although planting of those crops in the
Midwest has barely begun.
   Some private meterorologists reduced the chances for rain in the
Corn Belt in their morning forecasts, triggering active buying of
new-crop corn and soybean futures.
   A 12-day-old dock workers' strike at Brazil's Port of Santos is
also having a positive impact on soybean prices. Brazil is the
world's second-largest soybean producer after the United States.
   Forecasts for hot, dry weather in the central Plains continue to
support the wheat futures market.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 3\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.10 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 4{ cents higher with May at $2.75{ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents
to 3 cents higher with May at $2.00} a bushel; soybeans were 5
cents to 11 cents higher with May at $7.58{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange ahead of two Agriculture Department reports due
later today, the quarterly cattle-on-feed report and the monthly
cold-storage report.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .15 cent higher with June
at 71.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .48
cent higher with May at 76.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent to .30 cent higher with June at 45.52 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .17 cent lower to .23 cent higher with May at
31.12 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

<HEAD>Reactor Would Sit Vacant for 30 Years, Then be Dismantled</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Subs thruout to clarify that mothballing would affect damaged
Unit 2, but not operating Unit 1.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers of the Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant offered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission a detailed
look at what will happen if the facility's crippled Unit 2 is
mothballed, which the company hopes to do by the end of next year.
   The NRC said during a 90-minute meeting Thursday that it
expected to complete a study on the environmental impact of the
plan and release the assessment in the next few months.
   The plant's Unit 2 reactor was disabled in the nation's worst
commercial nuclear accident on March 31, 1979. The reactor was
allowed to lose the vital cooling water that normally covers it,
causing fuel and other components in the radioactive core to begin
melting.
   The plant's undamaged Unit 1 reactor was not affected by the
1979 accident has been operating since 1985.
   On Thursday, officials of GPU Nuclear, the plant's operator,
provided the NRC with an updated picture of Unit 2's future over
the next 30 years.
   In so-called ``monitored storage,'' the unit 2 reactor building
would be locked up, unneeded systems deactivated, and the reactor
left idle for up to 30 years while radiation decays. The unit would
then be dismantled.
   While insufficient fuel would be present to support a nuclear
chain reaction, relatively high levels of contamination would
remain in the reactor building basement during storage, plant
officials said. Radiation monitoring will be continued, and a
security force will control access.
   The NRC is still studying the environmental impact of the plan,
and Commission Chairman Lando Zech said at the meeting that its
report was due in June. The plan must also pass a separate safety
evaluation, said TMI spokesman Doug Bedell.
   Plant officials originally had hoped to have Unit 2 mothballed
by the end of 1989. But a three-month delay in removing damaged
fuel, combined with changes in the decontamination schedule, has
pushed the beginning of the reactor's storage phase ``toward the
end of 1990, with better than 99 percent of its nuclear fuel
removed,'' GPU Nuclear said.
   GPU Nuclear President Philip Clark told the NRC that the company
had sufficient ``resources, people and money'' to ensure the plant
could safely be placed in storage next year.
   Zech asked the company to formulate as specific a schedule as
possible for ending the cleanup.
   GPU Nuclear said at the meeting the cleanup is expected to be
completed within its $1 billion target. The operator said more than
three-quarters of the 150 tons of damaged fuel and other debris
have been shipped off the site, and the reactor's workforce is to
be trimmed from 960 last year to 250 in 1990.

   The stock market gained ground today, resuming
the rally that carried it to 18-month highs earlier in the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.60 to 2,383.98 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 692 up, 516 down and
589 unchanged.
   The market suffered a temporary setback Thursday when the West
German central bank announced unexpected increases in its official
interest rates.
   That raised fears of downward pressure on the dollar, and of
possible further credit-tightening in this country.
   By today, however, analysts said investors seemed to be taking
the view that the Federal Reserve would wait a while longer to
gauge the effects of the restrictive moves it has already made over
the past year or so.
   Thus, observers noted, the possibility remained open in many
minds that interest rates are close to or at a peak.
   Perkin-Elmer climbed 1{ to 24| in active trading. The company
announced plans to sell some of its operations and pass the
proceeds to shareholders in the form of dividends, stock
repurchases or a combination of the two.
   Syntex rose 1{ to 45~ and Smithkline Beckman 1 to 63|, on
speculation that either might become a takeover target of F.
Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph gained ] to 33~. The company's
report earlier in the week of a 20.7 percent first-quarter earnings
increase was warmly received by investors.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.49 to 171.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .80 at 342.13.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 83.38 million shares at

<HEAD>Ashland Oil Reports Net Loss In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. said Friday it lost $14 million in the second
quarter, due mainly to the steep rise in crude prices and the
settlement of a long-standing dispute.
   Ashland's loss amounted to 25 cents a share in the three months
ended March 31. In last year's second quarter, the Ashland,
Ky.-based company had net earnings of $21 million, or 37 cents a
share.
   Revenue totaled $1.9 billion, roughly the same as the second
quarter of 1988.
   Ashland Chairman John R. Hall said the latest results were not
unexpected after the sharp rise in crude oil costs, a major
refinery slowdown and the settlement of a long-standing dispute
involving its Riley Stoker Corp. subsidiary and Cajun Electric
Power of Baton Rouge, La.
   The quarter's results reflect a $9 million charge stemming from
the settlement, or about 15 cents of the per-share loss, said
Ashland spokesman W.P. Hartl,
   The dispute, dating back to the 1970s, involved an alleged
breach of contract by Stoker, of Worcester, Mass., in designing and
installing two coal-fired steam generators, the spokesman said.
   ``The March quarter historically is our most difficult period,''
Hall said. The jump in world crude prices of abut $10 a barrel
since last November, or about 24 cents a gallon, also hurt the
company's profits, he said.
   In addition, earnings were adversely affected by a seasonal
maintenance slowdown at Ashland's Catlettsburg, Ky., refinery,
which resulted in lower sales volumes.
   ``Product prices did not keep pace with rising raw material
costs and refinery margins were compressed,'' Hall said.
   ``As a result of these factors, Ashland Petroleum had a $19
million operating loss,'' he said.
   For the six months ended March 31, Ashland's net income totaled
$82 million, or $1.48 a share, up 34 percent from $61 million, or
$1.08 a share, in the previous six months.
   Revenue totaled $4.1 billion, compared with $3.9 billion in the
same 1988 period.
   The onset of the driving season and expected tightness in the
gasoline market, however, should boost refinery profit margins
through the remainder of the year, Hall said.

<HEAD>Bond Sale Ignites Passions, Controversy On Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was just a simple bond sale by a North
Carolina electric company. But it erupted into a controversy on
Wall Street that touched sensitive nerves and threatened to change
forever the bond market.
   The auction of the $100 million bond issue by Carolina Power &amp;
Light Co. almost broke the monopoly that investment houses enjoy
over the rights to bid on public debt issues.
   But at the last minute, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., the
renegade bidder, pulled out of the auction, apparently under
pressure from the four Wall Street bidders in the race.
   The only party willing to comment after the dust settled on
Wednesday's auction was Met Life, which said it had no qualms about
its action and would do it again.
   What Met Life did was to put in a bid for the bonds, which were
destined to be sold on the open market. The issuers of such bonds
traditionally hold an auction to sell the bonds to a Wall Street
firm, which in turn sells the bonds to the public at a markup.
   But Met Life wanted the bonds for its own investment purposes _
by law, insurance companies are barred from selling bonds or other
securities to the public.
   Insurance companies traditionally buy new bond issues through
so-called private placements, or issues that aren't designed for
the public market. With private placements, the insurance company
agrees to buy an entire block of bonds from the utility company or
other issuer. In turn, the buyer often has a say in how the bonds
are structured.
   Apparently Met Life persuaded Carolina Power to include
anti-takeover provisions, called protective covenants, in the
bonds, which made them attractive to the life insurance giant.
   Takeovers are a major concern of Met Life and other insurers,
who have seen the value of some of their bonds plummet after the
company that issued them was bought in a leveraged buyout.
   In particular, Met Life was burned when its RJR Nabisco Inc.
bonds turned into junk bonds after the leveraged buyout of the food
and tobacco giant earlier this year by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co. Met Life has filed a lawsuit against RJR and KKR over the
matter.
   Protective covenants to guard against a loss in bond value due
to takeovers, or ``event risks,'' traditionally are included in
privately placed bonds, said Paul Reardon, director of investment
research for the American Council of Life Insurance.
   ``There weren't many event risk losses on private placements
because there were protective covenants written in,'' Reardon said.
   But the four Wall Street firms bidding on the Carolina Power
bonds _ Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. _ apparently would not have
received the same safeguards. An hour before the auction, Met Life
said it was told that its bid would not be accepted by Carolina
Power. According to the Wall Street Journal, Wall Sreet firms
applied pressure on the utility to reject the bid.
   After the Met Life bid was rejected, Morgan Stanley won the
right to sell the bonds, Carolina Power said.
   Met Life said it wasn't deterred by the experience and would
make bids on public bond issues in the future.
   That statement is significant because insurance companies own
about half of all outstanding debt issues. Should other insurers
follow Met Life's path, it could signal a fundamental change in the
way bond issues are written and sold in this country.
   Such a change would further erode the territory of the Wall
Street giants, whose securities business already is threatened by
moves to allow banks and other institutions to sell securities. And
it could further cut into their profits, which have been slumping
due to the decline in interest in stocks following the market crash
of October 1987.

   University of Pennsylvania business students
say they will push for the removal of junk bond tycoon Michael
Milken from the Wharton School's Hall of Fame if he is convicted of
fraud and racketeering.
   ``If he's found guilty, I think they should yank him out,'' said
Tom Tziavragos, who will graduate this year. ``And if he's a crook,
I'm all for his going to jail. I think most of my classmates feel
that way.''
   Milken has given $2.25 million to Wharton since his 1978
graduation, spokeswoman Margaret Barry said. Milken is one of 16
Hall of Fame members whose photographs hang in Steinberg
Hall-Dietrich Hall on the University of Pennsylvania campus.
   Sophomore Lauren Krasnow said his continuing presence on the
wall, if convicted, would be unfair to the other honorees,
including real-estate mogul Donald Trump, Supreme Court Justice
William Brennan and the building's namesake, financier Saul
Steinberg.
   Wharton spokeswoman Denise Portner said Milken's portrait will
stay, at least for now.
   ``We don't think it is up to us to decide whether he is innocent
or guilty,'' she said. ``That is a matter for the courts.''
   The Hall of Fame members were chosen by student ballot several
years ago.
   Milken, 42, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier, was
indicted March 29 on 98 counts of defrauding clients through
insider trading and stock manipulation. A trial is expected later
this year.

   In the universe of financial affairs, the
Cincinnati Stock Exchange is a dwarf star in an oddball galaxy, the
only stock exchange in the world where all trades are executed by a
computer.
   But on some day in the next 19 months, a switch will be thrown
and market-watchers will train their telescopes on Cincinnati to
observe what many foresee as the dawn of a new age: the era of
24-hour stock trading.
   There will be no daily opening or close, at least not as we know
them today, and there will be no floor crowded with noisy, jostling
traders. There will be only the computer, humming, clicking and
beeping as it matches buy and sell orders streaming in from points
all over the globe.
   Such is the hope of the Cincinnati exchange and its partners in
the venture, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and London-based
Reuters Holdings PLC, which jointly announced their plans in March.
   But the 24-hour stock market is not a universal vision. It has
not been a goal publicly pursued by the New York Stock Exchange,
for example, although the nation's biggest stock market suggested
this past week it was considering a way to trade stocks
electronically when the floor is closed.
   ``To the extent that a customer has a need in the off-hours,
this institution has a commitmenmt to meet that need,'' Richard
Grasso, NYSE president and chief operating officer, told the Wall
Street Journal.
   The electronic-trading movement is a response to the
increasingly global nature of financial investing. The smaller the
world gets, the greater the search becomes among exchanges for ways
to capture business from overseas.
   The Cincinnati Stock Exchange, which averages 1 million trades
per day compared with 170 million per day on the New York Stock
Exchange, turned totally automated in 1976.
   Other U.S. exchanges have computerized parts of their operations
but thus far the switch to automated execution, which many see as a
prerequisite to 24-hour trading, has been carried on exclusively by
foreign exchanges. The Toronto Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange and a host of European financial markets use computers to
execute at least part of their orders.
   Chicago's commodity futures and options exchanges have recently
taken the electronic-trading lead in the United States. The Chicago
Board Options Exchange owns a controlling interest in the
Cincinnati Stock Exchange; the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will
launch its after-hours automated-execution system, called Globex,
this fall in partnership with Reuters; and the Chicago Board of
Trade, the world's largest futures market, is working on an unusual
hybrid trading system called Aurora, designed to recreate on a
computer screen the characteristics of a commodities trading pit.
   ``It's so obvious that this is coming, 24-hours-a-day electronic
trading, everywhere. It's just a matter of time.'' said Peter
Schwartz, president of Global Business Network, a small research
and consulting company based in Emeryville, Calif., that helped the
London Stock Exchange develop a computerization strategy.
   But Eric K. Clemons, an associate professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School specializing in computer and
financial issues, says that while the New York Stock Exchange
probably could convert successfully to round-the-clock trading, it
would require a massive investment in new technology and ``I don't
see it as an improvement over what the exchange has today.''
   What the New York Stock Exchange has today is an electronic
delivery system that routes orders to the exchange floor, where
they are handled by professional market makers called specialists.
   ``It's almost a cybernetic system, a man-machine synthesis, and
I think it works very well,'' Clemons said.
   Proponents of electronic trading say the specialist system for
stock trading, the raucous open-outcry auction tradition of the
commodity markets and virtually every other trading system in which
humans execute customer orders will inevitably be replaced by
computers that can perform the same task faster and cheaper while
keeping flawless records.
   ``I don't see how you're going to stop the march of technology
any more than the people who made slide rules stopped the march of
computers,'' said Junius Peake, a capital markets expert at the
Peake-Ryerson Consulting Group Inc. of Englewood, N.J.
   Sophisticated institutional investors face an ever-expanding
smorgasbord of opportunities. They trade U.S. stocks in New York,
currency futures in Chicago, yen bonds in Tokyo, British pounds in
London.
   Financial markets have responded by broadening their own
offerings to include products that once were traded only in their
home countries. Stocks such as IBM, General Motors and Matsushita
Electric have become ``world class'' stocks, traded on exchanges
both at home and abroad.
   Still, Japanese investors prefer to trade IBM in New York and
most American players want to trade Matsushita in Tokyo because the
markets for those stocks are larger at home than abroad.
   The more players there are in a given market, the more likely an
investor is to find someone willing to take the opposite side of
his trade at the price he wants. This is called market liquidity,
and investors tend to trade in the most liquid market available.
   But the most liquid market is not always open. When it's morning
in Tokyo, it's evening in New York. So Japanese investors seeking
to trade IBM in New York, where they are likely to get the best
deal, must wait for the New York Stock Exchange to open.
   A 24-hour electronic trading system would provide easy access to
the market, but critics say there is no guarantee of liquidity.
With no specialists on hand to take the opposing side of the trade,
the order would dangle there, waiting for an opposing order to
arrive.
   That's not what investors seek in a market.
   ``Liquidity follows liquidity and people don't trade where
people don't trade,'' Clemons said.
   Thus, the greatest challenge facing electronic markets is simply
getting enough people to use them.
   Reuters, which has 170,000 computer terminals in use by traders
and brokers worldwide, has been highly successful in getting people
to use its electronic products, which range from price-quotation
machines to an off-exchange trading network called Instinet.
   But spokesman Robert Crooke said human behavior, not technology,
will ultimately determine the shape of tomorrow's financial markets.
   ``Each system, whether completely automated, partially automated
or in fact fully human, has its advantages and its place, and that
place will always be dictated by the markets themselves,'' Crooke
said.

   The stock market staged a modest advance today,
resuming the rally that carried it to 18-month highs earlier in the
week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.80 to 2,386.18 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 775 up, 554 down and
557 unchanged.
   The market suffered a temporary setback Thursday when the West
German central bank announced unexpected increases in its official
interest rates.
   That raised fears of downward pressure on the dollar, and of
possible further credit-tightening in this country.
   By today, however, analysts said investors seemed to be taking
the view that the Federal Reserve would wait a while longer to
gauge the effects of the restrictive moves it has already made over
the past year or so.
   Thus, observers noted, the possibility remained open in many
minds that interest rates are close to or at a peak.
   Perkin-Elmer climbed 2\ to 25] in active trading. The company
announced plans to sell some of its operations and pass the
proceeds to shareholders in the form of dividends, stock
repurchases or a combination of the two.
   Syntex rose 1{ to 45~ and Smithkline Beckman | to 63\, on
speculation that either might become a takeover target of F.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph gained { to 34. The company's

increase was warmly received by investors.
   Navistar dropped [ to 5] on top of a {-point loss Thursday, when
the company said it had lowered its internal earnings projections
for both the current quarter and its full fiscal year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.61 to 171.91. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .72 at 342.05.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 118.67 million shares with two

   Setting up shop in Tokyo could cost a whopping
$186 a square foot, while the same amount of space in Kuala Lumpur
takes the small sum of $12, says a new survey listing average
prices of office space around the world.
   The survey released Friday by Colliers International Property
Consultants isn't intended to make the Japan-bound change course
for Malaysia, but it does offer a guide to budgeting space and
funds, said Collier's president Stewart Forbes.
   ``Essentially we want to get some sense of how different markets
compare and to be able to provide that to clients who are
increasingly active in a global market,'' he said. ``Somebody going
from Boston to Tokyo needs to budget not on the basis of Boston
rents, but on Tokyo.''
   Rounding out the top 10 were: London, $152; Hong Kong, $102;
Beijing, $78; Paris, $59; Sydney, $58; Zurich, $50; Boston, $48;
New York, $47; Washington, D.C., $47; and, Moscow, $46.
   Costs, gathered partly through consultants and partly through
the 1,500 real estate professionals linked to Boston-based
Colliers, include average rent and operating expenses such as
electricity bills.
   Half of the 54 cities surveyed had rents ranging from $20 to $34
per square foot.
   The business of finding overseas locations for U.S. firms has
boomed over the past five years, said Forbes.
   ``Real estate has always been sort of a local business, it's
almost been provincial in its outlook but as client needs became
global so, too, have local real estate firms,'' Forbes said.
   Jim Montanari, vice president of New York-based Cushman and
Wakefield, also involved in overseas commercial real estate, said
the survey's top 10 matches his experience with finding office
space, although he said he would probably place New York before
Boston.
   The biggest headache in renting office space abroad is learning
to deal with fewer resources and accepting such constraints as an
average 1 percent office vacancy rate in Tokyo, Montanari said.
   ``We're used to having multiple choices,'' he said. ``People
doing this for the first time, it's sort of shocking,'' he said.
   Forbes said the survey tried to stay away from broad averages by
addressing the specific area of prime downtown locations for 10,000
square feet for a period of five years beginning May 1989.
   Other findings of the survey included:
   _U.S. cities at the bottom of the spectrum included Dallas (30)
and Denver (32), both in the throes of overbuilding and
energy-related recession shocks, at $13 and $12 a square foot
respectively.
   _Seattle, Kansas City and Jakarta tied for 27th at about $20.
   _Rounding out the U.S. top 10 were Philadelphia, $41, Chicago,
$40, Los Angeles, $31, Atlanta, $30, Baltimore and San Francisco,
$29, Minneapolis, $28, Detroit, $26 and Fort Lauderdale, $25.

   Share prices on London's Stock Exchange closed
narrowly mixed Friday, having recovered from their lowest levels
after a rise in British interest rates failed to materialize.
   A small rise in the value of the pound and early gains on Wall
Street also helped equities rebound from their midday lows.
   However, analysts predicted that interest rate worries in
Britain would persist, following Thursday's increase in interest
rates by West Germany's central bank. As a result, shares would
continue to trade nervously next week, they said.
   ``What the Bundesbank has done has made the market rather
nervous. If sterling comes under pressure, we might have to put up
rates as well,'' said a director at a major British stockbrokerage
firm.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 3.4 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,061.0.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 2.0 points higher at
1,700.5. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 1.19 points to
close at 1,171.74.
   Volume came to 400.7 million shares compared with Thursday's
542.2 million shares.

<HEAD>Corporate Results Hold Few Surprises; Buyout Costing RJR Nabisco
Dearly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several corporate heavy hitters weighed in with
their first-quarter financial results this past week and most
figures tipped the scales close to where the companies intended.
   A grim performance by RJR Nabisco Inc. may have been expected,
due to its $25 billion buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., but
that didn't make the news any easier to bear.
   The company said it shouldered $247 million in so-called
``change of control'' costs, including severance pay, pension plan
benefits and other payments to executives leaving on account of the
buyout.
   RJR Nabisco shareholders are expected to approve the deal with
Kohlberg Kravis at a special meeting on Thursday.
   The flop of RJR Nabisco's Premier smokeless cigarette, which was
recently yanked from test market store shelves because consumers
rejected the brand, also had something to do with the earnings
slump.
   The company said its after-tax income in the January through
March period amounted to $103 million, down 62 percent from $273
million in the same quarter a year ago.
   Sales in the quarter were up 5 percent, to $4 billion from $3.8
billion in 1988.
   Without the buyout-related costs and a charge for abandoning the
Premier tests, net income would have been up 17 percent to $320
million in the first quarter.
   The leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco is setting precedents for
costs associated with these deals in which a target company's
assets and cash flow typically are tapped to finance the
transaction.
   For RJR Nabisco, further costs could show up in subsequent
earnings statements.
   The buyout was expected to impair RJR Nabisco's profitability
but the magnitude of the effect in the first quarter was a surprise
to some analysts.
   Among other companies posting results, General Motors Corp.
reported a 42.2 percent first-quarter profit gain, reflecting
improvements in North American automobile operations and continued
cost-saving measures.
   The nation's largest company said it earned $1.55 billion, or
$2.37 per share, in the three months ended March 31, up from $1.09
billion, or $1.56 per share, for the same 1988 period. Revenue rose
11.9 percent to $29.6 billion from $26.4 billion.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. reported a 20.7 percent rise
in first-quarter earnings to $594 million, or 55 cents a share,
from $492 million, or 46 cents a share, as revenue rose 3.2 percent
to $8.66 billion from $8.39 billion. AT&amp;T benefited from growth in
international sales of products and services plus a surge in
long-distance calling.
   BankAmerica Corp. said its net income soared 152 percent in the
first quarter, underscoring the strength of the big bank holding
company's recovery. First-quarter profit rose to a record $275
million, or $1.38 a share, from the prior year's $109 million, 56
cents a share. The parent of Bank of America lost $955 million in
1987 and rebounded last year to post a profit of $726 million.
   In other business and economic news during the week:
   _Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. announced a major restructuring
that involves the sale of its retail brokerage operation and a
reduction of as much as one-third in the number of its employees.
   Separately, a federal appeals court unexpectedly delayed
approval of the settlement between Drexel and the Securities and
Exchange Commission of securities fraud charges. SEC Chairman David
Ruder hinted the agency may still take action against Drexel Chief
Executive Officer Frederick Joseph.
   _Billionaire oilman Marvin Davis took his bid for NWA Inc.
directly to stockholders by offering $90 a share in cash in a
hostile takeover deal that could total $3.1 billion including
related fees. The offer for the parent of Northwest Airlines, the
nation's fourth largest carrier, expires at midnight May 17.
   _The Labor Department reported the Consumer Price Index rose 0.5
percent in March and increased at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the
first quarter. Although it was the fastest pace since the 6.3
percent rate in 1987's first quarter, the financial markets rallied
on the news because the numbers were better than expected.

<HEAD>Coca-Cola Buying Into Australian Food Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coca-Cola Co., pursuing a strategy of joint
ventures with overseas corporations, said Friday it plans to
acquire at least 41 percent of the Australian food and tobacco
giant AMATIL Ltd.
   Coke said it expects to pay $328 million for its stake in
AMATIL, which had revenue last year of about $1.7 billion.
   The acquisition is part of a proposed restructuring of AMATIL,
in which the Australian company plans to concentrate on its soft
drink and snack food business and spin off its tobacco interests
into a new company.
   The deal has been approved by the boards of Coke, AMATIL and
B.A.T. Industries, which is AMATIL's largest shareholder, and is
subject to the approval of AMATIL shareholders and Australian
regulatory authorities.
   AMATIL is one of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers in the world and
one of Australia's largest companies.
   Beginning in 1981, Coca-Cola began aligning itself with bottlers
and other companies in foreign countries in an effort to expand
business in the growing international soft drink market, said Coke
spokesman Randy Donaldson.
   Coke's major overseas ventures have been in the Philippines,
United Kingdom, Taiwan, Thailand, Canada and the Netherlands.
   Coke's latest earnings report, for the quarter ended March 31,
showed continuing growth in the company's international business,
with retail case sales up 8 percent and shipments of concentrate
and syrup up 6 percent over the same period a year earlier.
   Donaldson said 75 percent of Coke's operating income comes from
overseas.
   Soft drink industry analysts said the proposed AMATIL deal was a
good move for Coke.
   AMATIL ``is a powerhouse operation, really first class,'' said
Emanuel Goldman, an industry analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in San
Francisco. ``Australia is a dynamite market for Coca-Cola.''
   Goldman said the overseas market for colas is soaring, and the
AMATIL venture is consistent with Coke's international strategy in
the 1980s. He said it probably would not be the last of such deals
for Atlanta-based Coke.
   Goldman said AMATIL is a leader in the Australian snack foods
industry and Coca-Cola likely would play a minor role in the
day-to-day operation of the company.
   Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in New
York, said Australia is a ``pretty good market'' for Coke, with per
capita consumption of 195 eight-ounce bottles a year. U.S.
consumption of Coke is 42 gallons per person per year, Donaldson
said.
   With AMATIL focusing on its soft drink and food business under
the restructuring, there is potential for growth, Adelman said.
Already, he said, ``they account for the bulk of Coca-Cola's
operations in Australia.''
   Goldman said Coke's expansion overseas could have the ironic
effect of benefiting its competitors, namely chief rival Pepsi
Cola, by paving the way for increased cola consumption around the
world.
   ``Pepsi would be in a good position to benefit from the growth
of soft drinks overseas,'' he said. ``Coke doing well will be good
for Pepsi, because more people will be drinking colas.''
   Donaldson said, however, that Coca-Cola competes with more than
just Pepsi overseas. In Germany, for example, the soft drink maker
is up against the popularity of beer, and in Italy Coke is trying
to win the hearts and taste buds of wine lovers.
   ``We position our international competition as a battle for the
share of stomachs,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soybeans Surge, Grains Advance on Drier Weather Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher and
grain futures also advanced Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as
the weather outlook turned drier for the Midwest and Great Plains.
   Soybean futures also were supported by the slow movement of
Brazilian soybean meal to Europe, a function of a 12-day-old
dockworkers' strike at the Port of Santos, Brazil's largest harbor.
   But weather was the dominant factor and it is certain to remain
the key variable in the markets with corn planting expected to
begin in earnest this weekend in the Midwest.
   Weather forecasts will become even more critical when soybean
planting commences in several more weeks.
   ``Soybeans need more moisture to get started than corn does,''
said Walter Spilka, a grain market analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``When you see dry forecasts,
you're likely to see a better runup in the soybean market.''
   Predictions for continued dry weather in the Great Plains
bolstered wheat prices. The Kansas wheat crop has already sustained
significant dry-weather damage and without rain, ``there's no doubt
the crop will continue to deteriorate,'' Spilka said.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 5} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.15 a bushel; corn was 2\ cents
to 5{ cents higher with May at $2.75 a bushel; oats were 2 cents to
5\ cents higher with May at $2.02 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents
to 11} cents higher with May at $7.59 a bushel.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. hopes its move to use
recycled plastic in some of its products sets an example for the
rest of the industry.
   The Cincinnati-based company announced Thursday it is test
marketing four of its major liquid laundry and cleaning products in
bottles partially made of recycled plastic.
   ``P&amp;G's message is that plastics are recyclable, too, and should
be added to all recycling programs,'' said company spokesman T.
Scott Stewart. ``We want to promote development of a nationwide
program to collect, process and recycle plastics in consumer
packaging.''
   The company is test marketing its liquid Tide and Cheer laundry
detergents, Downy fabric softner and Spic and Span household
cleaner in bottles containing 20 percent to 30 percent recycled
plastic. The bottles are being test marketed in the states of
Washington, Oregon and Montana.
   ``All four products are being rolled out now toward the
Northwest,'' Stewart said.
   ``Not only is the Northwest farthest in distance, it also
represents informed areas relative to recycling. Seattle has a
curbside program in which paper, glass and aluminum are collected
separate from the trash,'' he said.
   Successful test-marketing of the bottles eventually could mean
the substitution of 20 million to 30 million pounds of new plastic
and recycled material annually, according to P&amp;G. The company hopes
it is the beginning of a major effort by companies to increase the
use of recycled plastics.
   P&amp;G said it has been working with various companies to produce
the recycled plastic bottles. The inner layers of all the bottles
are made of new plastic, and the outer layers are made with a
combination of new and recycled plastic.
   The bottles being used in the market test aren't specially
marked to note their recycled content. The initial shipments are
aimed at finding out whether the special bottles hold up to regular
wear and tear during shipping, Stewart said.
   The project won't necessarily provide a savings or marketing
advantage, according to Tom Rattray, P&amp;G's associate director for
corporate packing development.
   Deborah Anderson, the company's director of environmental
coordination, said Procter &amp; Gamble hopes to develop a way to use
high-density polyethylene _ the soft, flexible plastic used for
milk, juice, detergent and other bottles _ from any source,
including its own detergent bottles.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had worldwide sales of $19.3 billion during
fiscal 1987-88. Its businesses include laundry and cleaning
products, pharmaceuticals, and food and beverage products.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Experinces Loss in First-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Friday that
without $179 million gained because of an accounting change, the
company would have recorded a $10 million loss in first-quarter net
earnings.
   Reduction of the company's deferred tax liability through the
adoption of a new accounting standard had the effect of adding the
$179 million, or $4.68 a share, after taxes, the St. Louis-based
company said.
   Excluding that benefit, the company reported a loss in net
earnings for the quarter of $10 million, or 25 cents a share, on
revenue of $3.4 billion, compared with net earnings of $51 million,
or $1.33 a share, on revenue of $3.31 billion for the same period
last year.
   Earnings were depressed by an operating loss of $66 million in
the company's transport aircraft segment and a special provision
for interest on taxes related to a dispute with the Internal
Revenue Service over the timing of tax obligations, the company
said.
   In addition, the company said there was a 15 percent reduction
in operating earnings from combat aircraft.
   Contributing to the operating loss in transport aircraft was a
major reorganization of the Douglas Aircraft Co. initiated in the
first quarter to provide long-term improvements in operations. The
transition caused some disruption and ineffeciences, the company
said.
   Operating earnings in the combat aircraft segment declined as a
result of decreased performance in the manufacturing process, the
company said.
   Total interest expense in the aerospace and information systems
segments increased from $41 million in the first quarter of last
year to $99 million this year.
   The company said that while that was due partly to higher
interest rates and increased corporate borrowings, a large portion
of it related to a special provision for resolving tax issues.
   The corporation and the IRS have disagreed over the completion
dates of long-term contracts. Settlement with the IRS may result in
interest and previously deferred taxes being paid to the IRS, the
company said.

   Corporate researchers are discovering that
proper support for the buttocks can improve the bottom line.
   At the research complex of furniture maker Herman Miller Inc.,
engineers and technicians say comfy and supportive seats are
crucial in a country where 70 percent to 80 percent of workers have
sedentary jobs, many hunched over computers for long periods.
   ``Studies have shown that productivity increases ... when
ergonomic seating is introduced,'' said Neil Goldberg, a company
researcher. ``If people are comfortable and have the support they
need they will tend to sit longer and work longer.''
   Herman Miller, the world's second-largest office furniture maker
behind Steelcase Inc. of Grand Rapids, this week introduced two new
chair designs and invited reporters for a lesson in ergonomics _
the science of adapting working conditions to suit workers.
   The company sells comfort with statistics. It says absence from
work due to back pain has increased 40 percent since 1970, while a
total of about $5 billion is paid out annually to employees by
insurance companies for back and neck pain claims.
   When sitting, about 75 percent of a person's total body weight
is supported on four square inches of the buttocks. Sitting on a
hard, flat surface can put pressure of 85 pounds to 100 pounds per
square inch on the buttocks, which can restrict blood flow, Herman
Miller says.
   The company said about 38 percent of workers who sit in front of
computers most of the day experience back pain.
   Independent research confirms much of Herman Miller's sales
pitch.
   ``You can't just buy an office chair as an afterthought,'' said
Marvin Dainoff, a psychology professor at Miami University's Center
for Ergonomic Research in Oxford, Ohio, who has studied work
environments.
   ``If you focus on the employee's daily work and get a chair that
fits, you will see a difference in productivity,'' he said.
   In studies he performed in 1981-82, Dainoff had 12 temporary
clerical workers conduct data-entry work at a ``typical'' work
station with a standard desk, government-issue secretarial chair
and a computer terminal with attached keyboard under a bank of
fluorescent lights.
   The workers would rotate between that environment and an
``optimal'' one with good lighting, an ergonomic chair and work
station, adjustable keyboard and anti-glare monitor.
   Measuring key stroke and error rates, Dainoff found an average
24.7 percent increase in productivity with the workers at the
optimal work station. In a second study, the only variable was the
office furniture, and Dainoff found a 17 percent productivity
increase.
   Goldberg said comfort, self-adjusting support and the matching
of the seat to the worker's task are the most important factors in
selecting an office chair. The way to minimize the stress of a
static posture is to have a chair that allows the worker to move,
tilt, pivot, recline and stretch.
   ``A good chair becomes invisible _ you forget you're sitting,''
Goldberg said. ``If you're uncomfortable, sitting is all you think
about.''
   But a good seat doesn't come cheap: Herman Miller's stress-free,
production-enhancing, mid-priced office chairs list for between
$450 and $800.

<HEAD>SEC Tries New Tactic to Win Drexel Deal Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission asked an
appeals court Friday to consider a legal maneuver that could break
the logjam blocking final approval of the massive Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. settlement.
   The SEC and Drexel asked the appeals court to clarify or
reconsider its earlier ruling which blocks U.S. District Judge
Milton Pollack from considering a plan to settle the biggest
securities fraud case in history.
   The SEC and Drexel are now asking the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals whether another district court judge could consider the
tentative settlement.
   Pollack is barred from approving the Drexel-SEC settlement or
conducting any further proceedings in the case, pending a bid to
disqualify him for an alleged conflict of interest.
   In addition to delaying settlement of the SEC's civil action
against Drexel, the 2nd Circuit ruling also holds up Drexel's plea
agreement with federal prosecutors, requiring the investment
banking giant to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $650
million in fines and penalties.
   On Wednesday, the 2nd Circuit unanimously refused to modify its
earlier stay against any action by Pollack, but the appeals court
did not address the SEC's alternative proposal to let another judge
handle the matter.
   In Washington, SEC Solicitor Paul Gonson said the commission was
asking the 2nd Circuit to ``clear up any ambiguity, or to
reconsider that part of the initial request'' not mentioned in its
Wednesday ruling.
   The SEC, joined by Drexel and Cary J. Maultasch, a Drexel
employee named in the SEC action, asked the appeals court whether
it would consider allowing the judge sitting in Part I, the section
handling miscellaneous and emergency actions, to handle the
settlement.
   Wednesday's ruling ``made no reference at all to the Part I
judge,'' said Gonson. ``The reasoning in that order didn't appear
to undercut the authority of the Part I judge.''
   The challenge to Pollack first came from Drexel, which has since
withdrawn its objection. Drexel lawyers maintained Pollack should
be disqualified because his wife stood to make millions from a
leveraged buyout that Drexel had helped to finance.
   But the matter is now being pressed by former Drexel junk bond
chief Michael Milken and his brother, Lowell, who are not part of
either settlement. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet decided
whether to consider the Milkens' appeal but the process could delay
final approval of the settlement for months.
   The Milkens were named earlier this month in a massive federal
racketeering indictment seeking more than $1.8 billion in
forfeitures. They have pleaded innocent.
   Last week Drexel and the SEC asked the 2nd Circuit to modify the
stay, but the appeals court said allowing Pollack ``to consider and
possibly to approve this settlement would be to allow a change in
the status quo as it concerns the interests of Michael and Lowell
Milken before the Supreme Court has disposed of the case.''
   In seeking clarification of that order, Gonson noted that the
only issue before the Supreme Court in the Milkens' appeal is
``whether Judge Pollack can remain on the case,'' and turning the
case over to another judge would bypass the rule barring the 2nd
Circuit from altering a stay until the high court has decided.

   The stock market rallied today, resuming the
month-long advance that has carried it to new highs since the crash
of 1987.
   The market suffered a temporary setback Thursday when the West
German central bank announced unexpected increases in its official
interest rates.
   That raised fears of downward pressure on the dollar, and of
possible further credit-tightening in this country.
   By today, however, analysts said investors seemed to be taking
the view that the Federal Reserve would wait a while longer to
gauge the effects of the restrictive moves it has already made over
the past year or so.
   Thus, observers noted, the possibility remained open in many
minds that interest rates are close to or at a peak.

<HEAD>Channel One School News Show Test Ends with Future Undecided</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Whittle Communications LP sent out the last of
its experimental television news shows for teens on Friday but
won't decide until mid-summer if the commercially-sponsored project
passed or failed its test.
   The Channel One news program, a daily 12-minute newscast with
two minutes of product advertising per show, has been beamed by
satellite over the past seven weeks to six middle and high schools.
   The program has proven popular with many of the teachers,
principals and students in the six test schools. But it has drawn
criticism from some national education groups who object to
permitting paid pitches for shampoo, candy bars, sneakers and jeans
in the classroom.
   ``We thought a lot of the program,'' said Stan Jasinskas,
principal at Eisenhower Middle School in Kansas City, Kan., one of
the test schools. ``We think it probably ought to be continued
nationally.''
   Ed Winter, the Whittle partner in charge of the Channel One
project, said it may take two months or more to evaluate results of
the test and if it is feasible to expand the program nationally. He
expects a decision by mid-summer.
   The project's initial goal was to make the program and the
equipment available to as many as 10,000 schools in the fall of
1990. If it does that, Channel One would be Knoxville, Tenn.-based
Whittle Communications' largest single business.
   The speciality magazine and sponsored poster publisher had
revenue of about $150 million last year and estimates Channel One
could produce $100 million in revenue on its own.
   The Channel One test began on March 6 at Eisenhower Middle
School and at high schools in Knoxville, Tenn.; Cincinnati;
Billerica, Mass.; Detroit and Cerritos, Calif.
   In addition to 25 daily shows with advertising, Whittle provided
four-page course guides for teachers, a commercial-free live
broadcast of a space shuttle launch and several Public Broadcasting
System programs.
   In addition to criticism over subjecting students to product
ads, some educators have faulted the way Channel One is presented.
   Scott Thomson, executive director of the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, said research has indicated the best
way to use television as a teaching aid is to use it selectively as
part of a lesson.
   But he said Channel One fails to do that because it is beamed
schoolwide at a regular time of the day without regard to whether
the program fits in with whatever class may follow.
   Thomson said he is not surprised that the administrators at the
test schools speak highly of the program. ``You can't expect them
to say `I've made a poor professional judgment','' he said.
   The test schools get to keep the equipment Whittle installed no
matter what happens with the project. Schools who sign up if it
goes national would keep the equipment only as long as they showed
the program regularly.
   Whittle isn't the only company providing television programming
for schools, and educators expect that competing daily services
will emerge.
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s Cable News Network is already
involved in a venture with the National School Boards Association
that is making a weekly news wrapup show available to schools.
   Under the service called News Access, about 200 schools are
paying fees ranging from $200 to $600 a year for the rights to
replay in class all or parts of CNN's Week in Review program that
airs on Sundays.
   As part of that project, the schools get a 40-page classroom
guide via computer with tips on how the show can be used to
complement lessons in science, social studies, mathematics,
language or the arts.
   One of the differences between the services, however, is that
Whittle is providing about $50,000 in television sets, video
recorders and satellite dishes to each of the participating schools
while the schools subscribing to News Access must provide their own
equipment.
   Another is that Whittle requires that schools air its daily news
program to the entire student body each school day, while teachers
using the weekly News Access program are free to use segments in
class and are not bound to show any of it to their students.

<HEAD>Shareholder Resolutions Blitz 1989 Annual Meetings</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A record number of emotion-charged shareholder resolutions are
bombarding U.S. companies in the 1989 annual meeting season, on
topics ranging from South Africa to Northern Ireland to bans on
animal cruelty and nuclear weapons.
   The surge reflects a growing militancy among shareholders,
especially large institutions such as pension funds, which now see
annual meetings as an important forum to confront executives about
their ethics and priorities.
   ``I think the reason this is growing is because institutional
investors in particular have discovered they have responsibilities
for their stakeholders, pensioners or others, beyond just getting
as much of a financial return as they can,'' said Diane Bratcher,
director of communications for the Interfaith Center on Corporate
Responsibility, a New York-based activist church concern.
   Some also attribute the shareholder resolution movement to a
matured population of baby boomers raised during the antiwar
movement of the 1960s.
   Many of these people are now stockholders and stock mutual fund
investors, looking to put their money to work in ways that conform
to their own political and ethical beliefs.
   That's led to an explosion in professional investment funds that
use social concerns as a basis for what securities to buy. These
funds have grown from $40 billion in assets a few years ago to
about $400 billion now, securities industry figures show.
   ``There are a lot of '60s people who are still around and have
the money to invest,'' said Rosalyn Will, a researcher at the
Council for Economic Priorities, a New York group that follows the
shareholder resolution movement. ``Many have retained those values.
Many have kids who have those values, too.''
   Others say many corporate executives themselves have begun to
encourage shareholder resolutions as part of a strategy to show
they are more sensitive and responsive to the people who own their
companies.
   ``An interesting trend we've seen this year, more and more, is
that companies are realizing how to open a dialogue with
institutional investors,'' said Robert Amen, a corporate consultant
in Greenwich, Conn., who attends and evaluates dozens of annual
meetings.
   Three leading management consulting firms, Ernst &amp; Whinney,
Touche Ross &amp; Co., and Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, have started
publishing special booklets for executives on how to answer
shareholder queries at annual meetings, especially in an era of
economic uncertainty and growing questions about business ethics.
   ``Company directors and officials prepared for the 1989 annual
stockholders meetings will be responding to investors who are
concerned about not only the potential impact of results on
individual share prices but also the way companies are being run,''
Deloitte says in its booklet.
   The Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington-based
group that monitors corporate behavior, says a record 176
shareholder resolutions on sensitive issues will be voted on during
this annual meeting season, which generally runs from mid-April
through early June.
   That compares with 156 introduced in 1988, 108 in 1980 and 40 in
1973.
   Shareholder activists say the catalyst clearly has been the
effort aimed at compelling U.S. corporations to vacate South Africa
because of its white-minority government's systematic suppression
of the black majority.
   Although many South Africa divestment resolutions have been
routinely defeated at annual meetings, their sponsors say mere
discussion of the issue has raised management awareness and has
played a role in the departure of more than 140 U.S. companies from
that country since 1984.
   Moreover, sponsors of South African resolutions have been
gaining an increasing number of yes-votes at annual meetings,
forcing companies to reintroduce the resolutions the following
year. Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules on publicly
traded companies, shareholder resolutions receiving at least 3
percent approval the first year they are introduced must be on the
next annual meeting's agenda.
   Ms. Bracher, whose group has been a leading proponent of South
African divestment, said the success of the movement has inspired
other socially active investor groups to start their own campaigns.
   She said the fastest growing efforts target U.S. divestment in
British-ruled Northern Ireland and fair employment practices by
U.S. multinationals operating in Third-World countries.
   Aerospace giant Lockheed Corp., for example, has been targeted
by the pension fund managers of New York public employees over the
fair-hiring practices of the company's subcontractors in Northern
Ireland.
   Figgie International, a Richmond, Va.-based concern that makes
professional sports equipment, has been targeted by church-activist
groups over allegations of abysmal working conditions at its
baseball factory in Haiti.
   Animal rights, long an issue raised by picketers at annual
meetings, has become an agenda item as well. This year,
shareholders in at least 10 U.S. companies will be voting on
resolutions proposed by animal rights activists.
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a Washington lobby
group, has introduced shareholder resolutions on laboratory testing
at the annual meetings of American Home Products Corp.,
Bristol-Myers Co., Colgate-Palmolive Inc. and the Gillete Co.,
among others.
   The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
asked that McDonald's Corp. investigate the effect on animals of
factory farming, the mass production of chickens, cows and pigs
slaughtered for food. The ASPCA withdrew the resolution after
McDonald's agreed to conduct a study.
   Elsewhere, the Federation of American Scientists has introduced
shareholder resolutions at BankAmerica, Citicorp and Manufacturers
Hanover, three of Latin America's biggest creditors, requesting
them to persuade debtors Brazil and Argentina not to develop
nuclear weapons.
   Other shareholder issues on the agenda this season include human
rights in Chile; nuclear reactor safety; antibiotic-fed poultry;
Third World debt; and contributions to political action committees.
   William Morley, chief counsel for the SEC's division of
corporate finance, said he's noticed a growing sophistication by
shareholder activists who want to get resolutions on meeting
agendas.
   They know, for example, what eligibility rules are from state to
state, when to submit proposals to companies and how to seek SEC
assistance if they think a company has unfairly blocked a proposal
from consideration.
   ``A lot of social issue people have been writing them for
years,'' Morley said. ``But each time you go through a season you
get new groups involved, and they have a better idea of how you
jump through the hoops.''

<HEAD>Dollar Higher In Domestic Dealings; Gold Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede: LONDON</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar recovered from shocks over foreign
interest rate hikes to close higher in domestic dealings Friday
after putting in a mixed performance overseas.
   Gold prices slipped after rising overseas. Republic National
Bank of New York said gold was bid at $384.25 an ounce as of 4 p.m.
EDT, down $1 from late Thursday's bid.
   Although currency markets calmed down somewhat after the West
German central bank's surprise 0.5 percent hike in the discount
rate on Thursday, the dollar seesawed because of the uncertain fate
of an investment tax overseas.
   Traders said the market was battered by unconfirmed reports that
West Germany was about to eliminate its controversial withholding
tax on interest income.
   West Germany's finance minister, Theo Waigel, is trying to gain
enough political support to repeal or suspend the measure. Without
the tax, West German mark-denominated investments would become
increasingly attractive.
   Unconfirmed reports that the tax was to be eliminated ``took the
dollar down,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank of
Boston. Then, however, the reports were reversed.
   ``Had the statement not been rescinded, the dollar would have
traded much lower,'' Morrissey said.
   Traders also were concerned ``by what the market perceives as
the eventual rise in Japanese and British interest rates,'' said
Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co.
   Traders are looking to a batch of fresh economic statistics
scheduled to be released next week for an indication as to whether
the Federal Reserve will be prompted to raise interest rates, thus
offsetting the week's rate increases in Europe.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 131.45 Japanese yen, down
from 132.28. In London late Friday the dollar traded lower at
131.35 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 131.48 yen, from 131.15
yen on Thursday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7160 late Friday, more
expensive for buyers than late Thursday's $1.7115. In New York, one
pound cost $1.7135, cheaper than $1.7167 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.8485 West German marks, up from 1.8478;
1.6305 Swiss francs, up from 1.6295; 6.2720 French francs, up from
6.2675; 1,357.50 Italian lire, down from 1,359.00, and 1.1869
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1839.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday
included: 1.8460 West German marks, up from 1.8450; 1.6320 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6275; 6.2625 French francs, down from 6.2925;
2.0830 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0990; 1,357.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,361.50; and, 1.1850 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1840.
   Gold bullion prices were mixed. The late bid price of gold in
London, the major European metals market, was $384.40 a troy ounce,
up from $383.25. The late bid price in Zurich was $384.15, up from
$382.70. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $385.45 bid, up from
$383.95.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery slipped to $384.90 a troy ounce, from Thursday's $385.60.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.78 a troy
ounce, up from $5.76. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.756 an ounce, from $5.776 on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. President Hugh Chapman,
who has been offered a high level position as part of NCNB Inc.'s
unsolicited bid to acquire the bank, was named Friday as chief
operating officer of C&amp;S.
   However, a C&amp;S spokesman said the move had no connection to
NCNB's offer.
   ``This has been in the works a long time. We just announced it
at this time,'' said C&amp;S spokesman Scott Scredon.
   Chapman will retain his position of president in the newly
created job, and will head the Atlanta-based bank's policy
committee, a group of senior managers who guide the company.
   ``Hugh will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of C&amp;S
when I am not available,'' said C&amp;S Chairman Bennett A. Brown.
``All who know Hugh share my respect for his judgment and my
confidence in his leadership abilities.''
   C&amp;S has been targeted by Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB in a $2.4
billion takeover bid. NCNB's stock transfer offer has been rejected
by the C&amp;S board, which said it was inadequate and would face stiff
regulatory hurdles.
   NCNB Chairman Hugh L. McColl Jr., in a letter to Brown April 12,
addressed those objections and outlined what he considered the
benefits of the proposal. McColl offered Brown the chairmanship of
the combined company and said Chapman would have a key role.
   ``Hugh Chapman will become one of the most senior executives and
an important member of the combined management team,'' McColl wrote.
   C&amp;S officials have refused to meet with NCNB to discuss the bid.
NCNB, which has maintained its offer remains on the table, is
scheduled to hold its annual meeting Wednesday in Charlotte.
   Scredon said Chapman's promotion was prompted by Brown's recent
election as president of the Association of Reserve City Bankers,
an industry organization. That position will require Brown to make
frequent trips to Washington, he said.
   ``We don't want the machine to get bogged down. When he is gone,
we don't want things to grind to a halt,'' Scredon said.
   ``Bennett is still clearly the head man,'' Scredon added.
   Chapman joined C&amp;S Corp. as president in 1986. He previously was
chairman and chief executive officer of C&amp;S South Carolina, a
company he joined in 1958.
   As president, Chapman's duties have included all of C&amp;S'
financial areas, as well as strategic planning, marketing and
government relations.

   A new round of bargain fares between some of the
few cities still served by strike-crippled Eastern Airlines has
drawn a tremendous response, the company said Friday.
   But some Miami area travel agents didn't share the carrier's
enthusiasm.
   The fares announced Wednesday range from $29 to $99 for one-way
flights from Miami to New York, Atlanta, Puerto Rico, Haiti and the
Bahamas. A flight from Miami to New York, for example, would cost
$79 one way and $158 round trip.
   Eastern said Thursday it would restore other pre-strike routes
May 1 and offer cheap one-way fares along with them: Miami-Orlando
for $29, Atlanta-New York and Atlanta-Washington for $59, and
Atlanta-San Juan, Puerto Rico, for $119.
   ``The response to these new fares has been tremendous,'' George
Brennan, Eastern's vice president for marketing, said Friday. He
said Thursday's ticket sales of 23,000 ``tripled those sold on the
previous high booking day since the strike began March 4.''
   But Joyce Curtis, who said the Up Up and Away travel agency she
manages in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., once handled nearly $800,000 a
year in Eastern ticket sales, said the bargain rates had attracted
only two customers by Friday afternoon.
   ``And Eastern was once our preferred carrier,'' she said.
   Some travel agents, who had customers stuck with worthless
tickets after pilots and flight attendants joined striking
Machinists on March 4 to virtually shut down the Miami-based
airline, remain so disgruntled that they won't sell Eastern tickets
at any price.
   ``We're not booking Eastern right now,'' said Jan Lobota,
assistant manager of Hollywood Travel's office in West Palm Beach,
Fla. ``It's not to our benefit to sell Eastern tickets now. We
don't want the same mistake twice.''

<HEAD>Following Other Markets, New Yorks Stock Exchange Mulls 24-Hour Trading</HEAD>

   The venerable New York Stock Exchange, long a
bastion of resistance to the global push toward 24-hour securities
trading, said Friday it is studying ways of developing a system of
off-hours transactions.
   The admission by the 198-year-old Big Board was viewed as a
reaction to moves by competing stock exchanges to implement fully
computerized round-the-clock trading systems that could siphon away
business from Wall Street.
   Under computerized trading, shares of stock can be traded
electronically when the exchange floor is shut down via programs
that automatically match up buyers and sellers for various
securities.
   NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano said the exchange plans to
discuss the issue with customers, traders, institutional investors,
listed companies and securities firms.
   ``What we're saying is in the next six to 24 months we'll be
looking at a number of different things,'' Torrenzano said.
   ``We're not sure there is enough demand to make the NYSE go to
24-hour trading,'' he said. ``We have to go out and talk to all the
various parties in the market. Based on those needs and demands,
the New York Stock Exchange will be very responsive and committed.''
   The tiny Cincinnati Stock Exchange last month announced plans to
implement computerized 24-hour trading in the next 19 months. More
perilous for the NYSE, Chicago's two futures markets announced they
are developing after-hours trading systems.
   Overseas, the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange
and other markets have introduced at least partially automated
execution systems and have been open to the concept of harnessing
technology to give investors the option of buying or selling at any
time.
   ``I'm afraid it's possible that U.S. equities markets could move
to another marketplace domestically or even to another marketplace
offshore in the event of a better system,'' said Junius W. Peake,
chairman of Peake-Ryerson Consulting Group Inc., an international
capital markets firm. ``It's still the better mousetrap theory.
   ``It doesn't matter if you're in Tokyo or Bermuda or Rio de
Janeiro. I don't care where the location of the transaction occurs
as long as I know it's a good trade.''
   The New York Stock Exchange, where an average of 160 million
shares of the listed 1,680 stocks change hands daily, has resisted
automation, in part, Wall Street officials say, because of pressure
from floor brokers and firms not to tamper with the system.
   In today's NYSE, an electronic delivery system routes orders to
the exchange floor, where they are handled by professional market
makers called specialists, who shout out buy and sell orders in the
manner of an auction.
   These middlemen would be dinosaurs in a fully automated
enviroment, and unnecessary in off-hours trading, when a computer
system would match up buyers and sellers of a desired stock at any
time of day or night.
   One criticism of 24-hour electronic trading is that without
specialists to take the other side of the trade, orders will hang
in limbo until an opposing order arrives.
   Under the Globex trade-matching system developed by the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and the British firm Reuters Holdings PLC, the
number of orders, best bids and offers, and quantity of bids and
offers will be listed immediately on a computer screen.
   Another off-hours trading system, known as Aurora, planned by
the Chicago Board of Trade will simulate the chaotic commodities
trading pits on a computer screen.
   New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan received a
presentation by the developers of the Chicago Merc system last week
but was ``absolutely noncommittal'' about whether the exchange
would adopt new technology, a participant said.
   The NYSE maintains that it does not feel threatened by the
infusion of automatic trading.
   Torrenzano said the NYSE studied off-hours trading in 1984 and
1985 and found little demand. The NYSE _ the world's second-largest
exchange behind Tokyo _ in September 1985 expanded trading time by
a half hour daily, and is now open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
   ``I think we're living in a much more competitive environment
but I don't think that's causing us to take a closer look,'' he
said. ``To take a leadership position in the equities marketplace
today you must be looking at what everyone's doing all the time.''

   Financial markets staged a powerful comeback
Friday from a brief scare that an interest rate increase in West
Germany would trigger a spiral of rising rates around the world.
   Stock prices leaped in late trading and bonds rose after
Thursday's modest sell-off, which came after West Germany announced
it would raise key interest rates to stave off inflation.
   The fear Thursday was that West Germany's action could prompt
other nations to raise their own rates in order to keep global
money from flowing out of their currencies.
   That concern eased Friday as investors concluded that the
Federal Reserve would not necessarily push U.S. interest rates
higher.
   ``I think what the markets are telling us is that this was a
temporary scare and the underlying tone of the markets is
constructive,'' said Michael Metz, a managing director and
investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 32.08 to 2,409.46
after having fallen 9.53 points on Thursday.
   The rise, accelerated by program trading, brought the average to
its highest point since the October 1987 crash.
   In the credit market, the yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond dipped back below 9 percent, which it had exceeded
Thursday.
   West Germany is historically fearful of inflation, and its moves
to dampen price increases by tightening the screws on its own
economy have often sent ripples through the world economy.
   Indeed, the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark followed the
Germans Thursday in raising rates, keeping their nations'
securities attractive to investors.
   But the Federal Reserve has apparently concluded that it does
not need to raise U.S. rates, even if the failure to do so causes
money to flow abroad and the dollar to fall, Metz said.
   The Fed places more importance on the state of the U.S. economy
than on the dollar's level and has apparently concluded that the
level of U.S. inflation does not justify higher rates, he said.
   Some investment analysts say the West Germans are right to be
vigilant and that the United States could be in for a crisis if it
does not squelch inflation now.
   ``We're riding along on a wave of liquidity-inspired euphoria,''
said Samuel Thorne Jr., managing director for fixed-income
portfolio management at Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark Inc. in Boston.
   ``We're going to get a squall,'' he said.
   Although West Germany's inflation rate remains low by world
standards _ 3 percent year-over-year at the consumer level in the
latest tally _ the nation's factory usage rate is at a 16-year high
and economic growth is running above normal.
   Those factors prompted Thursday's announcement of increases in
the German central bank lending rates, said Nicholas Sargen, an
international economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.
   Still, the increases surprised the financial markets because
Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German central bank, had
said recently that interest rates were high enough to discourage
inflation.

   The stock market rallied with renewed force
Friday, extending the month-long advance that has carried it to new
highs since the crash of 1987.
   Analysts said stock prices got a strong boost in the waning
minutes of the session from professionals engaged in
computer-program strategies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 32.08 to
2,409.46, closing above 2,400 for the first time since it stood at
2,412.70 on Oct. 14, 1987.
   For the week the average rose 72.40 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
938 up, 523 down and 490 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 187.31 million
shares, up from 175.97 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 218.44 million shares.
   The market suffered a temporary setback Thursday when the West
German central bank announced unexpected increases in its official
interest rates.
   That raised fears of downward pressure on the dollar, and of
possible further credit-tightening in this country.
   By Friday, however, analysts said investors seemed to be taking
the view that the Federal Reserve would wait a while longer to
gauge the effects of the restrictive moves it has already made over
the past year or so.
   Thus, observers noted, the possibility remained open in many
minds that interest rates are close to or at a peak.
   Stocks did most of their climbing just before the close in a
barrage of program-trading activity linked to a set of expiring
options and futures on stock indexes and individual stocks.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the nation's most widely held
stock with about 2.7 million shareholders, gained 1\ to 34}. The
company's report earlier in the week of a 20.7 percent
first-quarter earnings increase was warmly received by investors.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included International
Business Machines, up 1[ at 113{; Exxon, up } at 44|; General
Motors, up ] at 42~; General Electric, up { at 48], and
International Paper, up 1 at 50.
   Perkin-Elmer climbed 2\ to 25] in active trading. The company
announced plans to sell some of its operations and pass the
proceeds to shareholders in the form of dividends, stock
repurchases or a combination of the two.
   Syntex rose 2~ to 47\ and Smithkline Beckman [ to 62}, on
speculation that either might become a takeover target of F.
Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $26.86 billion, or
0.89 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.60 to 172.90.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.11 to 357.49, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.42 at 309.61.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
2.25 to 423.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 342.59, up 1.26.

   A dramatic move to raise interest rates in West
Germany hasn't dashed hopes on Wall Street for a downturn in rates
in the months ahead.
   The news Thursday of half-point increases in the West German
central bank's official interest rates sent a jolt through the
American stock and bond markets, as well as driving the dollar
downward in foreign exchange.
   But stock prices stabilized soon afterward and began a speedy
recovery as analysts increasingly came to the view that a new
international round of credit-tightening wasn't likely.
   Statistical measures of business activity and inflation in West
Germany have been on the rise of late _ a development that prompted
new restraints in a very inflation-conscious nation.
   In the United States, however, there have been some recent signs
of slowing in the pace of the economy, apparently prompted by the
credit-tightening steps the Federal Reserve has taken over the past
year.
   Most observers believe the Fed wants to wait at least another
month or two to gauge the impact of what it has already done before
deciding on any further measures.
   ``We believe that the bond market is setting up for a major
buying opportunity by midyear,'' declares Arnold Moskowitz,
economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   He predicts that a rally in bond prices will send interest rates
on Treasury bonds, now fluctuating around 9 percent, to 7.5 percent
by yearend.
   Support for this kind of view can be found in the consumer
marketplace, says Richard Sichel, an analyst at First Pennsylvania
Bank.
   ``Sears will now sell consumer products for low prices every day
and not just on special occasions,'' Sichel points out. ``Ford, GM
and Chrysler will pay you cash to purchase their cars and are
hawking low- or no-interest-rate financing to help you decide.
   ``Whether all of this is necessary is conjecture. However, it
does send a message that the economy is not booming, inflation
should subside and interest rates may be near a peak.''
   That sort of talk helped the stock market extend a month-long
rally this past week to new highs since before the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 72.40 points to
2,409.46.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.01 to 172.90;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
6.08 to 423.76, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 6.77 at 342.59.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 178.40 million shares a day, up
from 168.89 million the week before.
   If interest rates do turn downward in the months ahead, analysts
caution, they may not represent an unalloyed benefit for the stock
market.
   One risk is that lower rates would encourage international
investors to seek out better returns on their money in other
countries.
   That, in turn, could mean downward pressure on the dollar,
crimping the results foreign investors can achieve in U.S. stocks.
   In addition, there is the threat that lower rates would be
accompanied by a substantial slowing of the economy and a dropoff
in corporate profits.
   ``In our view, the equity markets at some point this year will
conclude that the economy must slow down significantly if inflation
is to lessen,'' said Suresh Bhirud, chief investment strategist at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``Although the stock market still could rise somewhat or remain
near current levels, earnings disappointments could become a
stumbling block in the second half of 1989.''

<HEAD>Burger King to Drop Ayer as National Ad Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burger King Corp. said Friday it is looking for
a new agency to handle its national advertising after just 18
months with N.W. Ayer Inc., the firm that created the slogan, ``We
Do It Like You'd Do It.''
   The Miami-based fast-food restaurant operator said it had
already selected three agencies to compete for the assignment and
expected to decide by summer.
   The decision was not entirely unexpected because the nation's
second largest fast-food chain has undergone extensive managerial
changes since its parent, Pillsbury Co., was acquired earlier this
year by Grand Metropolitan PLC of Great Britain.
   Burger King's sales have been sluggish and it has been unable to
increase its share of the fast-food market, now estimated at about
17 percent.
   One of the three finalists is the Chicago office of J. Walter
Thompson, whose New York office was Burger King's agency for 11
years until it was dumped in favor of Ayer in September 1987.
   The other two finalists, Burger King said, are D'Arcy Masius
Benton &amp; Bowles, New York, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, New
York.
   D'Arcy formerly worked for the Hardee's Food Systems fast-food
chain and its Los Angeles office currently is the agency for
Denny's restaurants.
   Saatchi created the ``Where's the Beef'' advertising campaign
for Wendy's International Inc. in the mid-1980s.
   Barry Gibbons, Burger King's chief executive, said he was
looking for a national agency ``with global capabilities, solid
industry experience, bold creative and media expertise and sound
strategic thinking _ and then have the determination to stick with
that agency.''
   He said the company had informally reviewed potential agencies
since January. The three finalists are expected to present
proposals to Burger King in three to four weeks after which a
decision will be announced.
   Gary Langstaff, Burger King's new marketing chief, said the
search for a new national agency ``does not apply to our regional
agency structure,'' which apparently means Ayer will continue
producing local advertising.
   Joyce Meyers, a Burger King spokeswoman, said Burger King's
marketing budget for 1989 is about $215 million including spending
on national and local advertising and promotions. She said no
decision has been made on how much of that figure will be spent on
national advertising alone this year.
   Officials at the New York-based Ayer said they handled about
$150 million in billings for Burger King last year, split fairly
evenly between national and local advertising.
   ``We are disappointed, surprised, but not unprepared,'' Louis T.
Hagopian, Ayer's chairman and chief executive, said in a memo
distributed to employees.
   He noted that in the time Ayer held the account, Pillsbury had
four different chief executives while Burger King had four chief
executives and four heads of marketing.
   ``It is just a shame the agency has to take the rap for the
errors and inconsistencies of so many others who have come and gone
and come and gone,'' he wrote.
   Hagopian said that while there may be some layoffs, the agency
would do so ``as considerately as is humanly possible.'' About 100
Ayer people work on the account.
   He said the account represents about 10 percent of the agency's
$1.5 billion in billings and that the agency's finances were strong.
   ``This is a blow, but it isn't even touching the foundations,''
he said.
   Ayer launched the ``We Do It Like You'd Do It'' campaign in
February 1988. The company has relied less heavily on the theme in
recent months, however, focusing on individual product promotion
instead.
   Burger King's Myers said the decision to select a new national
agency was not as much a reflection on Ayers's work as a desire by
the company's new management ``to start with clean sheet and signal
this is a new Burger King.''

   When Ford Motor Co. introduces its new
light truck in the 1991 model year, a portion of the vehicles will
be sold to a subsidiary of Japan's Mazda Motor Corp., Ford
officials announced Friday.
   ``I think it's a great opportunity for an American manufacturer
to sell a product to the Japanese,'' said Harold A. Poling, Ford
vice chairman and chief operating officer.
   Poling offered no specifics about the new vehicle in his address
to a Kentucky Chamber of Commerce audience. There has been
speculation that the truck will be smaller than Ford's current
Bronco II.
   ``Some of the production will be sold to Mazda and marketed
under the Mazda badge,'' Poling said. ``The rest will appear next
year as a new Ford product and, although we are not ready to
describe our new vehicle, I can tell you we believe it will be a
real winner.''
   The agreement between Ford and Mazda North America Inc. appears
to be similar to a current pact under which Mazda makes the Ford
Probe and the Mazda MX-6. Mazda has done most of the design and
engineering work on the cars.
   The new truck probably will be engineered and designed mainly by
Ford, which has owned 25 percent of the Hiroshima, Japan-based
Mazda Motor Corp. since 1972.
   Poling said after the speech that it had not yet been determined
what percentage of the product would be sold to Mazda.
   He told the Chamber of Commerce audience that Ford has
researched alternative-fuel vehicles as a means of responding to
environmental concerns.
   ``We'd like to see cooperative industry and government
evaluation programs for alternative-fuel vehicles, along with
incentives to encourage consumer interest and increased
availability of alternative fuels,'' he said.

   An experimental news program for
children was hailed as a success Friday by students and the
principal at one of six schools nationwide that tested the show.
   ``We have been tremendously pleased with our participation in
the program,'' said Stan Jasinskas, principal at Eisenhower Middle
School. ``We have seen many positive results.''
   Eisenhower was one of the schools that watched Channel One, a
12-minute news program complete with commercials. The $5 million
program debuted in the six schools in March.
   The show resembled a network news program but with young
anchors, flashy graphics and a teenage perspective on the news.
   The commercials raised the ire of some children's advocates, who
feared advertisers would take advantage of children.
   But Ottice Hall, a seventh-grade student at Eisenhower, said he
enjoyed watching the programs at school.
   ``I liked it because they had all these fun things to watch,''
he said. ``And I liked the commercials. They had some new ones.''
   Ottice said he would like to keep ``Channel One.''
   ``It's fun to watch tv at school. I don't watch the news at
home,'' he said.
   Jasinskas said the program provided students with a valuable
educational lesson.
   Channel One featured the environment in a five-part series one
week, for instance, and some students wrote to fast-food
restaurants, soft drink producers and city councilmen to express
their concern about chemicals and recycling.
   ``Some kids got written responses from the mayor and from these
corporations,'' Jasinskas said. ``What happened goes beyond content
knowledge. The kids have picked up an appreciation for how the
system works. Whether just writing that letter is enough to bring
about a change, I can't say. But I know that the experience has
brought about a change in the kids.''
   The experiment exposed the children to news they otherwise would
not have seen, the principal said.
   ``With the lifestyles that kids have with school and homework
and church and some with jobs, they are not going to be regular
consumers of the news,'' he said. ```Channel One' has brought to
those kids consistent access not only to events but to issues.''
   If Jasinskas was making decisions for only one school instead of
a multi-building district, he said he would keep the program.
   ``I might find that I would want to tailor it a bit more to our
needs, but overall, I am very pleased. It has been a tremendously
valuable program,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Friday announced new
restrictions on smoking in its U.S. facilities.
   Effective June 1, smoking will be prohibited in conference
rooms, training rooms, classrooms and auditoriums. The ban will be
expanded Jan. 1, 1990 to include all enclosed offices and open
office areas, the No.2 automaker said in a statement.
   The restrictions will not apply to smoking in open factory and
garage areas within certain guidelines, the statement said.
   Ford also said it would expand stop-smoking services and
programs for both salary and hourly employees interested in
quitting smoking.
   Ford previously had designated smoking and non-smoking areas in
cafeterias while smoking was prohibited in some work areas because
of safety, Ford spokesman Dick Routh said.
   ``It's a bold step forward but reflects a growing feeling among
employees that they want a healthier work environment,'' Routh said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices rose strongly Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade after some private meteorologists reduced
the amount of rain in their forecasts for early next week in the
Midwest and Great Plains.
   On other markets, gold and silver futures retreated; livestock
and meat were higher and energy futures were mixed.
   In Chicago, wheat settled 4 cents to 5\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.14{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 5{ cents higher with May at $2.75\ a bushel; oats were 4 cents
to 5} cents higher with May at $2.02{ a bushel; soybeans were 4
cents to 12} cents higher with May at $7.60 a bushel.
   The sharp gains in the soybean and corn markets reflected
concerns about low soil moisture in Iowa, northwestern Illinois and
other areas of the Corn Belt still struggling to recover from last
year's drought.
   ``There's just a lot of nervousness that we're going to have a
repeat of last year,'' said James Candor, a meteorologist with
Accu-Weather Inc., a private forecasting firm in State College, Pa.
   Candor said Accu-Weather revised its forecast Friday toward the
dry end of the scale, predicting that a third of the Midwestern
croplands would receive about a half-inch of rain on Sunday or
Monday. On Thursday, Accu-Weather had predicted coverage of 40
percent to 50 percent.
   Weekend rain could hamper corn planting, though, and it would
not necessarily be beneficial for corn seedlings, which prefer
warm, dry conditions early in their growth cycle.
   ``Soybeans need more moisture to get started than corn does,''
said Walter Spilka, a grain market analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``When you see dry forecasts,
you're likely to see a better runup in the soybean market.''
   Predictions for continued dry weather in the Great Plains
bolstered wheat prices.
   Gold and silver futures prices fell slightly on New York's
Commodity Exchange in response to the dollar's gains against other
major currencies.
   Gold settled 70 cents to $1.20 lower with June at $388.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 2 cents to 2.2 cents lower with May at $5.765 a
troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in light, cautious trading ahead of two
Agriculture Department reports, the quarterly cattle-on-feed report
and the monthly cold-storage report, which were released after the
close of trading.
   In the cattle-on-feed report, the USDA counted 9.68 million head
of cattle on feedlots on April 1 in the 13 largest cattle-producing
states. The tally was 3 percent larger than last year's
first-quarter count and slightly above market expectations, but
probably not by enough to have much impact on Monday's trading,
analysts said.
   In the cold-storage report, the USDA found 133.8 million pounds
of frozen pork bellies on hand at the end of March, the fifth
consecutive month of record supplies. The USDA pegged total pork
supplies at 397.2 million pounds, the largest monthly supply figure
in the past 10 years.
   The numbers were close to market estimates and were not expected
to cause any sharp price movement on Monday.
   Live cattle futures settled .20 cent lower to .45 cent higher
with June at 71.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to
.50 cent higher with May at 76.17 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent
to .65 cent higher with June at 45.60 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .30 cent lower to .40 cent higher with May at 31.30
cents a pound.
   Heating-oil futures prices rose sharply on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, leading crude-oil prices higher in quiet,
technically inspired trading. Unleaded gasoline futures finished
narrowly mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 32 cents
higher with June at $21.32 a barrel; heating oil was .95 cent to
1.34 cents higher with May at 53.63 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .49 cent lower to .46 cent higher with May at 74.16
cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Unisys Posts Loss In First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. said Friday it lost money in the first quarter
because of ``transitory factors,'' but the computer maker predicted
a return to profitability in the current quarter and a strong
second half of 1989.
   Unisys said its loss, which it had publicly predicted, was the
result of a transition to a new mainframe computer line and the
resulting start-up costs, interruption in sales and inventory
reduction costs.
   The computer giant, which has headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa.,
and Detroit, said it lost $78.7 million. That is in contrast to a
profit a year earlier of $149.3 million, or 72 cents a share.
Revenue fell about 8 percent to $2.20 billion from $2.37 billion.
   ``Overall, we expect very strong year-over-year gains in revenue
and operating earnings in the second half of 1989,'' W. Michael
Blumenthal, the chairman and chief executive, said in a news
release.

   Petroleum prices finished mixed Friday, capping
a frantic week in which a North Sea oil platform explosion sent
crude oil to the highest level in more than three years.
   The explosion resulted in a supply shutdown that stopped the
shipment of more than 500,000 barrels a day of Brent crude, or
about 30 percent of total North Sea Brent oil production, Britain
Energy Minister Cecil Parkinson said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, finished
4 cents higher at $21.32 a barrel. Contracts for delivery after
June rose as much as 41 cents.
   The $2.04 surge in the May contract on Thursday set a record for
the highest one-day rise since the exchange started trading crude
oil futures in March 1983, said John Santana, NYME statistical
analyst. The contract closed at $24.65, the highest level since
Jan. 15, 1986, when it reached $25.15.
   In the four days before the contract expired on Thursday the
contract rose more than $3, or about 16 percent.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange Friday, unleaded
gasoline for May delivery fell 0.41 cent to 74.16 cents a gallon,
while the June contract was down 0.18 cent to 71.18 cents. Other
contract months finished higher.
   May heating oil, meanwhile, rose 1.34 cent to 53.63 cents a
gallon, with other contract months also registering gains.
   There was no word late Friday on when the Brent pipeline system
would return to normal. Officials of Shell U.K., the unit of the
Royal Dutch-Shell Group that operates the platform and the pipeline
system, indicated there might be a partial resumption of about
100,000 barrels a day starting Monday.
   British officials had indicated earlier in the week that the
closure could last up to four weeks.
   Analysts said the timing of the North Sea accident on Tuesday
was the biggest reason for rising prices, coming less than four
weeks after the Alaskan oil tanker spill that temporarily cut the
flow of oil to refineries and adding to concerns about tight
supplies of gasoline for the summer.
   ``We're heading into the driving season, only a month from
Memorial Day,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker with E.D.&amp; F. Man
International Futures Inc. ``This is when refiners want to start
increasing production of gasoline. They want to make sure they have
enough crude to run their refineries at full capacity.''
   Light North Sea Brent crude is in high demand because it is more
easily refined into gasoline. Analysts said there is plenty of
crude in storage to compensate for the shortfall if the North Sea
shutdown is not prolonged.
   ``The stoppage in the North Sea could be serious and for a long
time, but there is enough OPEC and non-OPEC crude to make up the
difference in the short-term,'' said James Steel, energy analyst
with Refco Inc.
   Steel said the North Sea accident is not likely to boost
consumer prices, barring a prolonged shutdown.
   ``Not because of this, but I think gasoline prices will go up
for other reasons,'' Steel said.
   Those include the change to higher octane gasoline required by
the Environmental Protection Agency and the reduction in refinery
capacity. The same amount of crude oil makes a smaller amount of
gasoline. Also, demand for gasoline has risen dramatically over the
last year while the refinery capacity has declined as many
antiquated refineries closed down.
   U.S. retail gasoline prices have risen more than 10 cents a
gallon since the Alaskan spill, based on a combination of factors,
including expectations of possible short supplies.

   Bond prices climbed back Friday after investors
concluded that other major central banks were not on the verge of
raising interest rates to match Thursday's increases by West
Germany.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 11-32 point, or $3.44
per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, slipped to 8.98 percent from 9.01 percent
late Thursday.
   Bond prices fell Thursday in the United States after the West
German central bank unexpectedly raised two of its key lending
rates.
   Traders worried that other nations would match the German
increases to keep global investors from pulling money out of their
currencies in search of higher yields. Higher rates depress prices
of existing fixed-income securities.
   The bond market recovered when there was no indication of
imminent credit-tightening by the Japanese, U.S. or British central
banks.
   ``The feeling now is maybe the Fed doesn't have to tag along,''
said Michael Metz, a managing director and investment strategist at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments were unchanged to 3-16 point higher,
intermediate maturities rose \ point and long-term issues were up
as much as 11-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.34 to 1,128.79.
   In corporate trading, industrials edged up. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, rose 0.92 to 302.32.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 1-16 point. The average yield to
maturity fell to 7.64 percent from 7.65 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills remained at 8.93 percent as
the discount stood unchanged at 8.63 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 9.09 percent as the discount jumped 10 basis points
to 8.59 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.32 percent as
the discount lost 1 basis point to 8.61 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 913-16 percent, down from 9~ percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Media General Profit Edges Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. said Friday its
first-quarter profit edged up 2.6 percent mainly because of a
one-time gain resulting from the sale of a newsprint mill.
   Net income rose to $11.9 million, or 46 cents per share, in the
three months ended March 31 compared with $11.5 million, or 40
cents per share, in the same period in 1988.
   The latest results include an after-tax gain of $5.7 million, or
22 cents per share, which Media General said resulted from the
federal income tax accounting treatment of the sale of its Pomona,
Calif., newsprint mill.
   First-quarter revenues fell 19.9 percent to $149.3 million from
$186 million last year.
   James S. Evans, president and chief executive officer of Media
General, said he expected financial results for the next two years
won't likely reach the highs set in 1987.
   In the latest quarter, newspaper profits fell 31.6 percent due
to a continuing slide in national and retail advertising and
ongoing competitive pressure in the Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla.
market, where Media General's Tampa Tribune is competing with the
St. Petersburg Times.
   Newsprint profits fell nearly 41 percent because of heavy price
discounting and the loss of income from the Pomona mill.
   But broadcast and cable profits nearly doubled from a year ago,
the company said, aided by growth at its Fairfax, Va., cable
operation and the absence of the company's broadcast services unit
that was sold late last year.

   Chrysler Corp. on Friday announced separate
recalls of some 1987-88 Jeep Wrangler and 1989 Dodge Raider
sport-utility vehicles.
   Chrysler said in a statement that it would replace windshield
wiper linkage components and install a reinforcement to the
windshield frame on about 80,000 Jeep Wranglers. The repairs were
needed to prevent potential cracking of the windshield frame at the
wiper pivot mountings, which in turn could cause dislocation of the
wiper linkage, the statement said.
   Chrysler also said it would install a heat adaptor plate below
the throttle body on about 4,600 Dodge Raiders equipped with
3-liter, six-cylinder engines. The repairs would prevent ice
formation on the throttle body blade in temperatures below 10
degrees, a condition that could prevent the throttle from returning
to the idle position when the accelerator pedal is released, the
statement said.
   Owners were being asked to return the vehicles to dealers for
free repairs, Chrysler said. The automaker said it was not aware of
accidents or injuries resulting from either problem.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan toured an
oily Alaska beach Thursday but said it was ``too early'' to draw
conclusions, but a congressman with him said it was clear Exxon and
the Coast Guard both were ``covering their rear ends.''
   The visitors from Washington, D.C., accompanied by U.S. Rep. Don
Young, R-Alaska, traveled to Naked Island where workers turned
firehoses on oil-covered rocks to wash the sludge back into Prince
William Sound where it was sucked up by a waiting skimmer.
   ``It looks like it will be a big job to clean it up,'' Lujan
told reporters who caught up with him after he eluded the news
media in Valdez.
   ``I was expecting something like this. I'd read about it and
seen it on TV, and this doesn't surprise me. It's too early for me
to say what I'll tell the president,'' Lujan said.
   U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a member of the Merchant Marine &amp;
Fisheries committee, said he had no trouble drawing conclusions
after separate briefings in Valdez by the Coast Guard and Exxon
officials.
   ``There were a lot of people covering their rear ends,'' Weldon
said. ``We got briefings by the Coast Guard and Exxon. They were
completely, diametrically opposite.''
   Lujan and his entourage divided their day between Valdez and
Naked Island, where the Exxon Valdez was towed for repairs after
running aground March 24, rupturing its tanks and spilling 10.1
million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound.
   On Friday, he will visit the rich fishing ports of Homer and
Kodiak, both threatened by runaway oil slicks.
   The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service already has tallied more than
2,000 dead birds and several hundred dead sea otters. Biologists
say the death toll certainly is many times higher, but the
remoteness and inaccessibility of Prince William Sound make an
accurate count impossible.
   A giant Soviet oil skimmer went to work Thursday along the Kenai
Peninsula, raising the hopes of Coast Guard officials who had no
skimmers capable of gathering floating oil on the high seas.
   Coast Guard Lt. Gary Stock in Anchorage said the 425-foot
skimmer Vaidogubsky spent most of the day getting in place and
testing its booms at the mouth of Resurrection Bay, where streamers
of oil that escaped into the Gulf of Alaska were being scattered by
strong wind and currents.
   From there, the skimmer was expected to move along the hard-hit
southern edge of the Kenai Peninsula, including the Kenai Fjords
National Park. State officials said oil up to six inches deep has
been reported on beaches around Gore Point, about 90 miles
southwest of Seward.
   A poll released Thursday showed a 21 percentage point drop in
the number of people who believe Bush is doing a good job in
handling environmental matters. And the administration's response
to the spill was lambasted at a Senate subcommittee hearing this
week.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner came to Alaska on Bush's
behalf a week after the spill and said he was generally satisfied
with Exxon's response. But Skinner took a much tougher stance when
he testified before the Senate this week.
   Describing the oil industry's contingency spill response plan,
Skinner said: ``On the scale of one to 10, it was a zero.''
   The big Soviet skimmer ship was called in because the small
boats available in Alaska can handle seas only to about 5 feet.
Seas in the Gulf of Alaska recently have run as high as 12 feet.
   Bigger skimmers weren't built because cleanup contingency
planners didn't expect oil to get outside Prince William Sound,
which is largely protected from rough waves by a series of islands.
   The Vaidogubsky is the world's largest oil-skimming vessel. It
is owned by the Far Eastern Sea Oil and Gas Deep-drilling
Organization, a government-owned enterprise. The ship can pick up
800 cubic meters of sludge per hour with booms and two pumps.
   The Soviet ship was working in conjunction with the U.S. Coast
Guard, but state officials relinquished command to Exxon of a fleet
of more than 300 other vessels engaged in the cleanup. They said
the move was to improve coordination.
   Jim Hayden of the state Department of Environmental Conservation
said monitors will be placed on larger vessels to make sure Exxon's
claims of oil recovered aren't exaggerated and the number of dead
animals isn't undercounted.
   State Environmental Conservation Commissioner Dennis Kelso said
Exxon claims to have recovered 13 percent of the 10.1 million
gallons spilled. But he said the figure probably includes seawater
sucked up with the oil.
   The oil has gotten progressively more difficult to clean up as
it congeals from the effects on wind and water. Two Coast Guard
skimmers were knocked out of action when the sludge fouled their
pumps.
   Exxon says the recovered oil will be mixed with fresh North
Slope crude and taken to West Coast refineries to be turned into
heating oil and asphalt.

<HEAD>Pacific Telesis Agrees On Option To Buy Cable TV Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pacific Telesis Group, in a move that could
set off a major legal squabble, said Thursday it had agreed in
principle to acquire an option to buy an interest in the Chicago
cable television properties owned by Group W.
   The move, if approved, would mark the first time one of the Baby
Bell telephone companies has entered the cable television field.
   Pacific Telesis said an affiliate of Prime Cable of Austin,
Texas, has an agreement in principle, which it expects to be
finalized next month, to buy Group W's Chicago cable television
assets for $198 million.
   Prime also has agreed in principle to sell a 68 percent interest
in the properties to a financial partner, which similarly has
agreed to sell its interest to Pacific Telesis Group if the phone
company receives regulatory and legal approval.
   James Mooney, president of the National Cable Television
Association in Washington, D.C., said his group would fight the
Pacific Telesis proposal. He said it appeared to violate the 1984
federal consent decree under which American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. spun off its local telephone operations, such as Pacific
Telesis, into seven regional holding companies informally called
Baby Bells.
   ``We support the consent decree, which is premised on
justifiable fears of telephone companies using their huge monopoly
phone business to cross-subsidize and otherwise impede competition,
and therefore intend to oppose the granting of a waiver,'' Mooney
said.
   The consent decree prohibited the seven Baby Bells from
competing in information services businesses such as home banking,
shopping or electronic Yellow Pages. The decree also prohibited the
phone companies from owning cable TV programming out of concern
that the companies could use their monopoly telephone earning
powers to price cable TV services unfairly.
   Non-Bell companies such as General Telephone in California, a
division of GTE Corp., are allowed to operate cable systems outside
the telephone companies' local service areas. The Federal
Communications Commission last year granted GTE a waiver to that
cross-ownership rule, allowing GTE to build a cable system in the
Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos.
   NCTA has challenged that waiver and the FCC is scheduled to
consider the challenge next week.
   Group W's Chicago cable operation serves more than 97,000
subscribers in a franchise area encompassing 410,000 homes.
   ``We believe cable television is a promising line of business
for us,'' said Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer of
Pacific Telesis.
   The Department of Justice has approved the terms of Pacific
Telesis' proposed option and is notifying U.S. District Judge
Harold H. Greene, who oversaw the AT&amp;T breakup, of the approval.
The corporation expects to file a waiver request with the court
this summer.
   Last year, Pacific Telesis invested in cable television
operations in London with Jones Intercable Inc. as its partner.
   The divestiture agreement that outlines what types of businesses
the regional telephone holding companies may pursue in the United
States requires a company requesting a waiver to show that ``there
is no substantial possibility that it could use its monopoly power
to impede competition in the market it seeks to enter.''
   Ginn said he is optimistic about the prospects for receiving a
waiver.
   ``We don't see how we could use our (telephone) exchange
position in California to impede competition in Illinois in any
way,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar, Share Prices Lower</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei, comments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was lower against the Japanese yen
at midday Friday, while share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange in morning trading.
   The dollar, which started trading at 131.35 yen, down 0.93 yen
from Thursday's 132.28-yen finish, was quoted at 131.65 yen by late
morning. It moved in a range of 131.30-131.75 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
178.68 points the previous day, shed another 79.53 points, or 0.24
percent, to finish morning trading at 33,105.62.
   The index lost 354.51 points earlier mainly due to interest rate
hikes in West Germany and European nations and higher oil prices,
but it made up some losses toward the end of the morning session
when Salomon Brothers (Ltd.) bought 15,000 shares of each of the
225 key issues, said Satoru Nagayoshi of New Japan Securities in
Tokyo.
   West Germany's central bank raised interest rates, including its
official discount rate, by half a percentage point to 4.5 percent,
effective Friday, to stem inflation, while similar moves were taken
by other central banks in the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark.
   The securities company bought issues soon after the index's
early morning plunge to pick up cheaper issues, Nagayoshi said.
   But a majority of market participants were reluctant to buy
ahead of the weekend, he added.
   On the currency exchange, traders said the dollar's low opening
followed its slide on overseas markets after a round of interest
rate hikes by the European countries. In New York, the currency
closed at 131.13 yen overnight.
   After opening lower, the dollar edged up as speculative
investors and export companies bought dollars for their payments,
said a trader with a Japanese commercial bank, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama said early Friday that
he saw no need to raise the country's discount rate.
   Murayama, speaking at a press conference following a regular
Cabinet meeting, said: ``I don't see any need (right now) for a
change in credit conditions.''
   ``We don't want to go against business trends,'' Murayama said,
adding that prices and other business conditions are ``stable,''
although he admitted concerns over inflation have grown recently.
   The minister also noted that the current yen-dollar exchange
rate ``isn't that much to worry about,'' but that its impact on
prices is important or bears ``caution.'' He was referring to the
effects of a relatively weak yen in undermining domestic price
stability.

<HEAD>Mexico Asks Extension on $1.175 Billion in Principal Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Mexico asked Friday for an
extension on $1.175 billion in principal payments due over the next
year on commercial bank loans while it tries to negotiate a
broadly-based financial package.
   The announcement came as officials from Mexico continued talks
begun Wednesday with a bank group in an effort to develop a new
debt repayment plan.
   Mexico owes both commercial banks and government lenders about
$107 billion, making it the developing world's second-largest
debtor behind Brazil, which owes $121 billion.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari wants to reduce the burden
of Mexico's foreign debt and keep more money inside the country for
economic investment.
   The current talks involve only the portion of Mexico's total
debt owed to commercial banks.
   Angel Gurria, deputy secretary of Mexico's ministry of finance,
and William R. Rhodes, co-chairman of the Bank Advisory Committee,
said the interim extension request was made in a telex being sent
Friday to Mexico's commercial bank creditors.
   The Bank Advisory Committee endorsed the request.
   The government is asking for an extension until the second
quarter of 1990 principal payments totalling $1.175 billion that
are due starting July 1 through March 31, 1990. The payments
involve agreements reached in 1983 and 1984.

<HEAD>Perkin-Elmer to Sell its Semiconductor Equipment Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with figures on profitability in fiscal 1988.</HEAD>

   Perkin-Elmer Corp. announced Friday it
intended to sell off its business of making equipment for
semiconductor manufacturers, which has been marginally profitable
and has lost world market share.
   Reflecting the slippage of the U.S. chip industry overall,
Perkin-Elmer ranked as the world's eighth-largest equipment
supplier last year, down from second in 1979.
   The company said the business had operating income of $3.2
million on revenue of $199.6 million in the fiscal year ended July
31, 1988.
   Perkin-Elmer said it also would sell its West German aerospace
unit and its government systems unit and distribute the proceeds
among shareholders through increased dividends or stock repurchase
plans.
   The West German unit had operating income of $32.2 million on
revenue of $162.7 million last fiscal year, while the government
systems business had operating income of $13.6 million on revenue
of $145 million.
   The sales will allow the company to focus more attention on its
scientific instrument and materials technology businesses, it said.
   No buyers have yet been identified for the three units to be
sold off. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., the New York investment-banking
house, is advising Perkin-Elmer on the restructuring.
   Horace G. McDonell, chairman and chief executive officer of
Perkin-Elmer, said the restructuring will direct ``management
attention and financial resources to its core businesses.''
   McDonnell said the move will make Perkin-Elmer a ``streamlined
competitor'' in the manufacture of sophisticated scientific
instruments and related materials technology.
