   The opposition says Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's appointment as chief executive is just another
effort to perpetuate his dictatorship and makes democracy an even
more distant dream for Panama.
   The general's hand-picked legislature declared Panama in a state
of war on Friday and named Noriega chief executive to combat what
it called U.S. aggression.
   ``To confront this aggression, the job of chief of government of
Panama is hereby created, and Manuel Antonio Noriega is designated
to carry out these responsibilities as maximum leader for national
liberation,'' the resolution said.
   Noriega, chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces and already the
power behind the government, is wanted in the United States on
federal drug trafficking and money laundering charges.
   Washington has tried to oust him from power for 2{ years with
diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions. But the general has
weathered the U.S. pressure as well as military coups attempts in
March 1988 and in October.
   The 510-member assembly's resolution says Noriega can appoint
public officials, control foreign relations, convene the assembly
and ``make decisions on whatever other matter or unforeseen
circumstance'' affects the nation's interests.
   ``The Republic of Panama is declared to be in a state of war
while the (U.S.) aggression lasts,'' said the resolution, passed by
acclamation by the People's Assembly.
   Noriega was sworn in on the spot.
   ``This designation is a new imposition of a dictatorship that
exists only to perpetuate Noriega's power,'' a statement from the
Democratic Alliance of the Civic Opposition said.
   The alliance said Noriega's new title is a ``mere symbol.''
   Noriega, it said, ``has been exercising unlimited power since
the day he took command of the Defense Forces in 1983'' and the
appointment shows ``the dictatorial nature'' of his regime.
   It said Noriega's appointment was ``a step backward in the
search for a democratic solution'' that would only ``serve to
produce more and more complex problems'' for Panama.
   Nonetheless, the opposition reaffirmed its determinaton to
``keep struggling to achieve liberty and justice for the Panamanian
people.''
   In Washington, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger on Friday called Noriega's appointment ``a charade and
nonsense.''
   ``As far as we are concerned, at least, there is no government
in Panama anyway,'' he said.
   As head of the government, Noriega holds the same title as the
late dictator Gen. Omar Torrijos, his mentor.
   Noriega claims the U.S. indictments are part of a plot to renege
on the 1977 treaties signed by President Jimmy Carter and Torrijos
that turn over operation of the canal to Panama at the end of the
century.
   Noriega has propped up a succession of powerless presidents
while he controlled the country.
   Panama has not had an elected government since Sept. 1, when the
last presidential and legislative terms ended.
   Elections were held May 7 to fill those spots, but Noriega
annulled the balloting before all the votes were counted.
International observers said the opposition was winning by a 3-1
margin.
   Noriega then named Francisco Rodriguez, a friend since high
school, provisional president and appointed the nation's mayors and
county chairmen to the People's Assembly. Rodriguez's position was
expected to become a largely ceremonial post.
   Assembly members were applauded for attacks on the United
States. One asked the government for guns for all citizens
``because what we have to do here is kill gringos and pro-gringos.''

   A drawing found behind the wall of an Oklahoma
closet is being auctioned as the work of Pablo Picasso, but art
experts and the woman it supposedly portrays say they doubt its
authenticity.
   The owner of the pen-and-brush piece, jewelry engraver Jim
Montgomery of Norman, Okla., said Friday he had the work checked
out by a forensic document examiner in Oklahoma.
   It is up for sale at a weekend auction here by Kruse
International, an Auburn, Ind., auction house that specializes in
the sale of vintage cars. Kruse art director Jeff Doner said he
hopes for bids as high as $3 million to $5 million.
   Picasso's former mistress, the subject of the drawing, doubts it
is an authentic Picasso, and one expert said even if authentic it
would be worth no more than $250,000.
   Montgomery said he was given the work by a young couple he had
helped financially. The couple found the drawing of a young woman
about 11 years ago, tucked between two walls in the back of a
closet in an apartment they were renovating in Norman, he said.
   Recently, a friend suggested the drawing might be a Picasso, and
Montgomery decided to find out.
   ``It started out being a lot of fun and turned out to be a
tremendous amount of work,'' said Montgomery. ``But I had to know.''
   Montgomery had a scientific analysis done by Ernest Smith, a
forensic document examiner from Oklahoma City. He verified that the
ink of the signature was the same as that of the drawing, and
matched the signature with real Picasso signatures, among other
things.
   Montgomery acknowledged the drawing _ ``Portrait of a Young
Girl,'' isn't listed in Zervos, an extensive catalogue of Picasso
works.
   The drawing is said to be of Francoise Gilot, the mother of
Picasso's two grown children, Claude and Paloma. The late painter
used Ms. Gilot as a model from 1944 to 1953, when they lived
together.
   But the purported model doubts its authenticity.
   ``If they would want to know if it's correct, they would ask my
son or myself or my daughter,'' Ms. Gilot said in a telephone
interview from New York.
   ``The fact that they didn't ask anybody in the family is not a
good sign,'' said Ms. Gilot, a painter in her own right now married
to Jonas Salk, the developer of a polio vaccine.
   Art experts said Friday that scientific analysis is generally
only part of the verification process.
   A check of the Zervos catalogue ought to be the first step in
checking out such a work, said Virgilia Pancoast, of the
International Foundation for Art Research, in a telephone interview
from New York.
   ``The thing we would do beyond that ... the most crucial thing,
would be to go to a Picasso expert for an opinion,'' said Pancoast,
director of the authentication service for the non-profit
organization.
   ``It would seem reasonable to me that anyone attempting to sell
a work for that price would have the documentation to back it up.''
   John Richardson, a friend of Picasso who is writing a biography
of the late artist, also said an expert on the artist should have
been consulted.
   ``It's no good going to a forensic expert in Oklahoma City,'' he
said from New York. ``You have to go to a Picasso expert. They must
be desperate if they go to such a strange source for an opinion.''
   But both Richardson and Pancoast said the drawing could be
genuine.
   Even if authentic, the piece would be unlikely to reach seven
figures, Richardson said.
   ``A very high price would be $250,000,'' he said.

   The Christmas star said to have led
the three wise men to Bethlehem could have been a conjunction of
Jupiter, Saturn and Mars, a physicist says.
   The three planets were in conjunction _ appearing from Earth to
have merged _ in 6 B.C., about the time of the birth of Christ,
said Gary Henson, a physics professor at East Tennessee State
University.
   ``The combined light of all three of them would be brighter than
any star,'' Henson said.
   Other astronomical phenomenon also have been offered as
explanation for the Christmas story, including a supernova, or
exploding star, a comet, or Venus, which can shine very brightly at
times.
   One drawback to the conjunction theory, Henson notes, is that
the wise men were said to be educated in astronomy and should have
recognized the lining up of the three planets or some other
recurring astronomical event.
   ``Even many thousands of years ago, they knew the motions of the
planets,'' Henson said. ``If it was one of those natural objects,
they should have been aware of it.''

   His age and size, combined with his ties to
the business community, prove Santa Claus is a Republican, a Rotary
Club has determined.
   Since they weren't able to check his voter registration,
Rotarians in this Portland suburb could only guess Santa's
political affiliation. But more than half of the 60 people
attending Thursday's debate, most of whom were Republicans, decided
to claim the jolly old elf as one of their own.
   Tigard city administrator Pat Reilly said Santa, like most
Republicans, is an older man dedicated to family values.
   The fact that St. Nick has lent his jolly image to marketing
schemes indicates he's sympathetic to business interests, said
Reilly. His concept of merit pay _ gifts only for the nice _ also
fits the Republican image.
   But Bill Knudsen, director of Tigard Community Youth Services,
disagreed.
   If Santa were a true Republican, Knudsen said, he'd live in
balmy Palm Beach instead of the North Pole.
   An then there's that long, white beard.
   ``I mean, maybe he'd have a pencil-thin mustache, but everyone
knows it's illegal in America for a Republican to wear a beard,''
Knudsen said.

   Giving your true love all the gifts
mentioned in ``The 12 Days of Christmas'' would cost $8,401 this
year.
   That's the estimate of Texas Comptroller Bob Bullock, who notes
state and local sales tax would have to be added in many areas.
   Here's the rundown, at Texas prices:
   _ A partridge, $40.
   _ Two turtle doves, $25.
   _ Three French hens, $18.
   _ Four calling birds, $250.
   _ Five golden rings, $648.
   _ Six geese-a-laying $90.
   _ Seven swans a-swimming, $7,000.
   _ Eight maids a-milking, at a salary of $200 a day.
   _ A pair of ballet tickets to see nine ladies dancing and 10
lords leaping, $50.
   _ Eleven pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming could be had for
two $40 symphony tickets.
   If it all seems a bit much, there's always a card, about $1.50.

   Visitors who drive hundreds of miles to
see the tiny town named after St. Nick are greeted by a sorry Santa
who slumps and groans.
   Some residents say the condition of the 30-foot fiberglass Santa
on the edge of town is embarassing. Others say it's downright
dangerous.
   ``People stop there all the time to sit their kids on his boots
and snap pictures,'' said Marlin Rook. ``Wouldn't it be tragic if
someone was standing there and Santa Claus fell on them?''
   Santa is slumped forward on crumpled boots, with only a steel
cable to support his weight. When the winter wind whistles by, the
not-so-jolly old elf rocks and moans.
   The statue beside Highway 245 is the most prominent of two Santa
Clauses still standing of four the Chamber of Commerce erected in
1981. One was blown over and another, located near a high school,
had to be removed after students covered it with graffiti.
   Last year, Mrs. Rook and resident Cammie Pruss repainted the
statue. But in July, Santa began to slump forward. Since then, he's
steadily gotten worse.
   Now a property is considering loaning money for some of the
needed repairs, estimated at from $2,500 to $3,000.
   ``A lot of people who live here have lived here all their lives
and they don't realize how neat it is,'' said Mrs. Pruss, who is
from Pittsburgh. ``You don't see these statues of Santa Claus
standing around everywhere.''

   Chuck Norris, the tough-guy hero of such
movies as ``Good Guys Wear Black'' and ``Delta Force,'' wore a dark
suit for the unveiling of his Hollywood Walk of Fame star.
   About 200 people gathered for Friday's ceremony on Hollywood
Boulevard near the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, where star No. 1,905
bears Norris' name.
   ``I really didn't expect this kind of a turnout,'' said Norris,
who was accompanied by his wife, two sons and mother. ``I'll always
remember this day.''
   President Bush wrote a letter to the action-film icon, known as
a staunch Republican, which read: ``It's in concrete now: You are a
star. But we all knew that.''
   Originally a martial arts teacher, Norris went into acting on
the recommendation of Steve McQueen, who was one of his students.

   A woman accused of sending threatening
letters to actor Michael J. Fox pleaded guilty to three felony
counts and was placed on probation for three years.
   The surprise plea bargain by Tina Marie Ledbetter, 27, was
entered Friday. In exchange for the three guilty pleas, prosecutors
dropped two counts. She could have been sentenced to four years in
prison if found guilty of all charges.
   The 28-year-old California woman allegedly sent nearly 6,000
threatening letters to the ``Family Ties'' star over the course of
a year, with 800 of them arriving in July 1988, the month he
married actress Tracy Pollan.
   ``Divorce Tracy or you are dead!'' one letter said. ``I am
coming after you with a gun and I'm going to kill you if you don't
divorce Tracy immediately.''
   Fox, 28, whose movie roles include ``Back to the Future'' and
``Bright Lights, Big City,'' was unavailable for comment, said his
publicist, Nancy Ryder.

   The Army says it won't give the Medal of Honor
to a Wisconsin man because it could not prove his claims that he
single-handedly killed more than 500 Japanese soldiers during World
War II.
   Congressional leaders, who pushed for the investigation into the
claims by David S. Rubitsky, accepted the findings Friday and said
they found the probe ``fair, thorough and conclusive.''
   Lt. Col. Terry Adkins told reporters the Army could not even
prove fierce fighting occurred Dec. 1-2, 1942, as claimed by
Rubitsky, now 72.
   The Milton, Wis., man contends he was denied the medal because
he is Jewish.
   ``I could not find any basis of this,'' Adkins, chief of the
Army's Military Awards Branch, said of the anti-Semitism charge by
Rubitsky. ``I just don't have the information to prove it.''
   At his home, Rubitsky said he had not been formally notified of
the board's ruling. ``I'm not going to make a statement until I'm
damn sure what the facts are myself,'' he said.
   ``We're very disappointed but we're not giving up yet,'' his
wife, Katherine Roethe, said.
   Adkins said the decision not to award the medal came after the
Army examined scores of documents, including testimony from
Japanese prisoners of war, battle logs and interviews.
   The officer told Congress of the Army's findings earlier Friday,
and four lawmakers quickly issued a statement saying: ``The
investigation established as conclusively as possible after half a
century that there was no mass killing of Japanese attackers at
Buna in New Guinea in 1942.''
   The statement was issued from Reps. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman
of the House Armed Services Committee, and Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y.,
and Sens. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., and Herbert H. Kohl, D-Wis.
   ``What we are dealing with here is not a lie fabricated by the
generals and Mr. Rubitsky. It is simply the unfortunate result of
the passage of many years, the fogging of many memories and the
reliving of many difficult memories from a war long past,'' the
statement said.
   Rubitsky said he killed up to 600 Japanese soldiers in the New
Guinea jungles during a 21-hour siege. According to Adkins,
Rubitsky said he believed his action saved his battalion from
imminent attack and he killed wounded enemy soldiers with a bayonet
and pistol.
   Adkins, noting the latter claim would have been against the
Geneva War Convention, said his studies showed there were about
1,000 American troops and 500 Japanese soldiers in the area called
Buna and the Japanese were in a defensive rather than offensive
stance.
   Rubitsky said there was fighting through the night, but
battalion logs indicated it was quiet. Tours by officers indicated
little activity. In fact, Adkins said, the company commander was
relieved for failing to follow Gen. Douglas McArthur's order of:
``Take Buna or don't come back alive.''
   Japanese records likewise don't support the contention that
intense combat occurred, Adkins said.
   Joseph Stehling, a retired brigadier general, signed an
affidavit outlining Rubitsky's actions and saying he nominated
Rubitsky for the Medal of Honor. Retired Gen. Herbert Smith, who
died in September, signed a similar affidavit.
   Another affidavit in the case, signed by a military messenger,
said a colonel, now dead, had denied Rubitsky his medal because
Rubitsky was Jewish.
   In a 1988 interview, Rubitsky said he had received numerous
anti-Semitic phone calls and threats after deciding to fight for
the medal.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal safety official says a consumer
group is misleading the public by criticizing child safety seats
when in fact they are the ``single most effective safety device
ever developed for an automobile.''
   Jeffrey Miller, deputy administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, attacked the Center for Auto Safety
after the group issued a report Friday declaring that millions of
children are riding in unsafe child restraint seats.
   Center director Clarence Ditlow said more than half of the 27
million child car seats sold over the last eight years are ``in use
despite being recalled or failing compliance tests.''
   The center and parents of children killed or injured in
allegedly defective child restraint seats blamed the federal safety
agency for allegedly failing to issue recalls or enforce those it
does issue.
   ``Children ride at risk because recalled seats are not replaced
or repaired, warning labels are approved that never reach owners,
investigations are dropped without recalls and compliance test
failures are ignored,'' Ditlow told a news conference.
   But Miller said, ``It is categorically false to suggest, as Mr.
Ditlow does, that half the seats on the road are dangerous.''
   The official acknowledged, however, that only 7 percent of seats
subject to recalls are actually brought into compliance. He said
recall responses for all products are low and most of the 26
recalls issued over the last decade involve minor problems.
   He said laws requiring child safety seats in all 50 states and
the District of Columbia have pushed usage to 82 percent of
automobiles with children.
   ``They have saved thousands of lives since their introduction,''
Miller said at a news conference called to respond to Ditlow's
report.
   Department analysts estimate that wide use of safety seats has
reduced infant deaths in car accidents by about 70 percent.
   Miller, and Ditlow, urged consumers concerned about the safety
of child restraints to call the Transportation Department's auto
safety hotline (800-424-9393) for information about any seat or a
list of recalls.
   Ditlow's report said 622 children were killed while strapped
into child safety seats in the last decade. The study did not cite
how many children died because of unsafe seats, how many died from
the improper use of the seats and how many died in accidents in
which no amount of protection would have saved the child.
   Among problems cited in recalls were belt fasteners that don't
hold, belts that are too loose, buckles that pop open, seat shells
that crack, seats that incline too far to hold the child and belt
choking hazards.
   A major child seat manufacturer, Evenflo, said through spokesman
Bob Potter that some seats the center named have been on the market
for years, with millions sold, and have proved their safety benefit.
   Ditlow alleged at least 8 million seats have failed safety
compliance tests but were not investigated or recalled by the
government, while an additional 3.4 million were investigated but
not recalled. Of 5.6 million subject to recall, he said, only
300,000 were actually replaced or repaired.
   The Washington-based Center for Auto Safety is a non-profit
consumer organization that has been critical of the auto industry
and has accused the government of soft-pedaling several safety
issues in favor of manufacturers.

<HEAD>Bush Budget to Avoid More Cuts in Social Security Workforce</HEAD>

   President Bush will spare the Social Security
Administration more staff cuts next year amid complaints the agency
is already understaffed and unable to provide high quality service,
according to government sources.
   John Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, which represents agency workers, said the
decision to avoid more cutbacks is ``a signal that perhaps the
administration has realized the severity of the problem.''
   ``We do not have the necessary people that we need to do the
type of job we want to do,'' Sturdivant said. ``This just keeps the
problem from getting worse. It doesn't solve the problem.''
   The Office of Management and Budget had proposed that Social
Security's staff be cut from 63,000 in the current fiscal year to
58,800 in fiscal 1991, but withdrew the plan at the urging of
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, a department
source said Friday.
   Sullivan and Bush met Thursday to discuss the HHS budget for
next year, and the president agreed not to seek staff cuts at
Social Security, said the HHS source and another government
official, who both spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush presents his proposed 1991 spending plan to Congress on
Jan. 22.
   The Social Security Administration's workforce has been slashed
by 20 percent in the last six years as part of an effort to
modernize and streamline operations. But employees have complained
they are overworked and unable to properly serve the public.
   The decision to avoid further staff cuts was welcomed by Sen.
David Pryor, D-Ark., the chairman of Senate Special Committee on
Aging, who said it showed ``a refreshing change of heart'' after
reductions in the Reagan years.
   ``SSA services provide a view for millions of American of their
government in action _ when service deteriorates, as it has in the
Reagan years, we hear about it,'' Pryor said. He credited Bush,
Sullivan and new Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King for
opposing further cuts.
   Eileen Sweeney of the National Senior Citizens Law Center also
welcomed news that further cutbacks would be averted, but she
warned that current staffing levels are inadequate.
   ``At 63,000, they do not have the staff to run the program,''
Sweeney said. ``They have staff that are totally overworked.''

<HEAD>Judge Approves Bunker Hunt Bankruptcy Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The bankruptcy case of Nelson Bunker Hunt was
settled with the balance of the former billionaire's fortune
transferred to a trust that will pay off his debts.
   Hunt and his wife Caroline filed for protection owing more than
$1 billion to creditors. In the settlement approved Friday by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson, the $222 million that remains
will be transferred to a liquidating trust next month.
   The Hunts will keep their $1.8 million mansion, Cadillac, and 50
percent of the proceeds received from non-producing gas and oil
properties.
   The smaller estate of Hunt's brother, William Herbert Hunt,
remains under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but is expected to
be closed next week.
   Most of the funds raised under the liquidation of the Bunker
Hunt trusts will go to the Internal Revenue Service. Minpeco S.A.,
a Peruvian mining concern that won a $132 million judgment against
the brothers stemming from their alleged attempt in 1979-80 to
corner the silver market, also will receive a large share of the
liquidated estates.
   Bunker Hunt said he had no plans to rebuild the fortune he
parlayed from the millions he inherited from his father, oilman
H.L. Hunt.
   ``I'm 64 years old. I'm too old,'' Hunt said upon leaving the
bankruptcy hearing.
   Under terms of the settlement, Hunt lost his real estate
holdings, including an Australian ranch and the Bronco Bowl
recreation center in Dallas.

   Those health claims that have been multiplying
on food labels as the American fitness craze has grown would be
restricted under a plan by the Food and Drug Administration.
   The plan would limit claims of health benefits to areas where
only scientific evidence shows an interaction between diet and
health, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said Friday.
   That means companies would be allowed to make claims based on
evidence that dietary fiber and low fat may reduce risk of cancer
and heart disease and low sodium may help reduce risk from high
blood pressure, he said.
   Grigg said any claims would have to make clear that the food was
part of a total balanced diet.
   The FDA used to prohibit health claims on food, but in 1987 put
into effect a rule that it now says has proved to be too permissive
and has allowed companies to make overly broad health claims.
   Over the last two years, manufacturers' health claims about the
role their products play in reducing disease have proliferated.
   The FDA's proposal is being reviewed by Louis Sullivan,
secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, which
includes the FDA. Sullivan is expected to approve the plan and send
it to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which
reviews all regulatory proposals.
   If OMB clears the proposed rule, it could be a year before
public comment is gathered and a final rule published, said Grigg,
who added that ``to some extent the industry would probably follow
it'' even before the rule was made final.
   FDA's proposal is a revised version of a 1988 proposed
regulation that failed to win OMB approval.

<HEAD>`Vultures' Rip Off Charity Donors, Senate Panel is Warned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials are warning holiday
charity-givers to beware their gifts don't end up in the pockets of
hucksters who prey on seasonal benevolence.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, told a Senate panel Friday that
millions of dollars each year ``end up not in the hands of the
deserving but in the pockets of the deceiving.''
   ``In some cases, these vultures simply create their own charity
for the sole purpose of putting out a heart-tugging mailing and
cashing in on the forthcoming checks,'' said Metzenbaum, who is
sponsoring legislation to tighten regulation of charities.
   Officials of leading charities and state officials said lax
accounting rules have enabled self-described charities to make it
appear that they provide much more money to education and services
than they actually do.
   West Virginia Secretary of State Ken Hechler said one group
claimed to have spent $571,300 to fight hunger in the United States
after mailing out ``carloads of books on microeconomics. ... How
can we eat books on microeconomics?''
   Connecticut Attorney General Clarine Nardi Riddle said new
accounting rules allow charities to shift ``a generous portion'' of
their funds into administrative functions, including fund-raising
by mail.
   A charity may claim the mailing has the dual purpose of raising
money and educating the public. Even an organization that raises
$10 million through a mailing and pays $9.75 million to its
fund-raising consultant can report half of the amount passed on to
the fund-raiser as a program service expenditure, she said.
   ``If something is not done soon, there will be a devastating
erosion of public confidence,'' she said.
   Col. Walter C. French, the Salvation Army's deputy director of
national public affairs, said that in any fund-raising operation of
the group's size, some volunteers will engage in irregularities.
   ``But practices of that nature are never countenanced or winked
at the Salvation Army,'' he said.

   The Pentagon soon will approve plans submitted
by 10 commanders for increased activities in the war on drugs, a
spokesman said Friday.
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney received the reports Oct. 15 on
``how their commands could become more involved in the support to
counter-narcotics missions,'' said Maj. David Super. ``We can't
talk about any of the specific recommendations.''
   Military sources said, however, that future plans included more
use of AWACS surveillance and control aircraft to detect planes
carrying drugs, air deployable ground-based radar systems, naval
combat ships and fixed and mobile sensors.
   One Marine Corps reconnaissance team helping the Border Patrol
in Arizona exchanged gunfire with marijuana smugglers on horseback
Wednesday night, officials said Friday.
   No one was injured in the Wednesday night firefight which
members of the U.S. group estimated at 30 minutes in duration.
After the alleged smugglers fled on horseback, Marines and Border
Patrol agents, who were on foot, confiscated about 570 pounds of
marijuana.
   The incident marked the first direct conflict involving Marines
since they began accompanying the Border Patrol about two weeks ago.
   The Marines Corps referred questions to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which did not immediately respond.
   The military's role under Cheney is markedly different from his
predecessor, Frank Carlucci. Whereas Cheney describes the
military's participation as ``crucial,'' Carlucci said in June 1988
he was ``absolutely opposed to the assignment of a law enforcement
mission to the Department of Defense.''
   Meanwhile, officials declined to comment on a report by CBS News
that the Pentagon had authorized plans by military units to capture
fugitive drug criminals in foreign countries.
   The Washington Post said in Saturday editions that a Justice
Department memo of Nov. 3 concludes that the federal law forbidding
use of the military as police officers does not apply outside the
boundaries of the United States.
   The Defense Department's larger role in counter-narcotics began
last year with a congressional appropriation of $300 million. That
figure was upped to $450 million this year.
   Congress assigned the Pentagon to be the lead and coordinating
agency for detecting and monitoring aerial and maritime drug
smuggling, creating a network for the intelligence community and
increasing the work of the National Guard.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that Air Force analysts
have suggested the service use high-resolution spy satellites to
provide glimpses of shifting ground bases for drug traffickers,
including their jungle laboratories.
   It said Navy budget planners recommended shifting some Atlantic
training operations to the Caribbean, where sailors could keep
watch on drug trafficking from international waters off Colombia.
   ``With peace breaking out all over, it might give us something
to do,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified two-star general as
saying.
   Cheney last month approved the formation of a new anti-drug task
force at Fort Bliss, Texas. The new group, Joint Task Force 6, is
to deal with drug activity along the southern border. It joined two
other task forces set up earlier this year to stem the flow of
drugs.
   The one at Oakland, Calif., ``detects and monitors aircraft and
surface vessels suspected of smuggling illegal drugs into the
United States from the Pacific,'' a statement said. The one in Key
West, Fla., conducts counter-narcotics work in the Caribbean.
   In its report Thursday night, CBS News said one unit authorized
to capture drug fugitives abroad was the Army's Delta Force hostage
rescue team.
   The report said the U.S. military became involved after an
informant told the U.S. government last summer that Pablo Escobar,
one of the kingpins of the Colombian drug trade, was hiding at a
seaside villa in Panama.
   Troops and helicopters were moved to a U.S. base in Puerto Rico
to prepare for an attempted capture Labor Day weekend, but the plan
was aborted out of suspicion the informant was incorrect. It turned
out Escobar was not in Panama that weekend, CBS said.
   U.S. News &amp; World Report magazine published a similar account of
the Escobar plan in last week's issue.

<HEAD>California Environmentalists See Victory In Fight Over Mono Lake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEE VINING, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daniel Taylor still remembers the
warning a water department official gave him when environmentalists
began a series of David-and-Goliath court battles with Los Angeles
over scenic Mono Lake.
   ``It's good that you're young,'' the official said, ``because
you'll be old when it's resolved.''
   Those environmentalists have reached or are approaching middle
age, but thanks to a series of favorable court decisions, they have
victory in sight, says Taylor, western regional representative for
the Audubon Society.
   What once seemed a quixotic struggle to save a woebegone lake
has gained the backing of court rulings and legislative action in
recent years as Southern Californians began to come to grip with
environmental concerns over their water and air.
   ``The original question was will we win. Now it's a question of
when will we win,'' said Taylor, 38, who became involved in the
case in the late 1970s. ``It's clear that Mono Lake will not die.''
   Mono was formed a million years ago in a volcanic area just east
of what is now Yosemite National Park, about 260 miles north of Los
Angeles and due east of San Francisco.
   The lake, which in its heyday covered about 80 square miles, is
best known for its high salt level and oddly shaped limestone
formations _ tufa _ that stand cactuslike along part of its shore.
   Mark Twain called the place ``the Dead Sea of the West.''
Naturalist John Muir saw it as a ``country of wonderful contrasts:
Hot deserts bounded by snow-laden mountains ... frost and fire
working together in the making of beauty.''
   Congress created a national forest scenic area at the lake in
1984.
   But Mono has been shrinking since Los Angeles began diverting
water in 1941 using an aqueduct system to tap tributary streams.
   The diversions have dropped the lake's level about 40 feet and
reduced its size to about 60 square miles. Environmentalists say
that if the trend continues the lake will be turned into an
``alkali wasteland'' unable to support Mono's brine shrimp or
various birds.
   But recent court rulings and legislation indicate the
environmentalists may be able to claim victory.
   ``There have been very important developments that signal that
it really is a question of how soon, rather than whether, Mono Lake
will be protected,'' said Martha Davis, executive director of the
Mono Lake Committee, an environmental group created in 1978 that
now has 20,000 dues-paying members.
   ``There's also much more work ahead of us to really translate
some of the legal and political victories of this year into
permanent protection for the lake.''
   Duane Georgeson, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, says it's ``a little early for
anyone to claim a victory unless you're interested only in counting
court orders.''
   But he says the city recognizes ``that at some point there will
have to be some reductions in our diversions.''
   Environmentalists won a major victory in 1983, when the state
Supreme Court ruled that water uses could be altered to protect the
``public trust.''
   They scored this year when state courts said that Los Angeles'
licenses to export water from the Mono Lake Basin must be revised
to require the city to release fish-sustaining flows in four
streams that feed the lake.
   Also this year, a Superior Court judge issued a preliminary
injunction that, in effect, forced the city to stop taking water
from the basin. The injunction remains in force through March, and
environmentalists say they will seek to extend it.
   The Legislature, with backing from environmentalists and Los
Angeles, voted this year to create a $60 million fund to find ways
to replace water the city takes from the Mono Basin.
   The author of one of the bills, Democratic Assemblyman Phil
Isenberg, said the city-environmental group support for the
legislation signaled ``the beginning of the end to an acrimonious
50-year water war.''
   ``Los Angeles has seen the handwriting on the wall,'' he said.
``Psychologically, this is a new LA. ... These are folks who don't
like to be portrayed as rapers of the environment. They would like
to get out from under it.''

<TEXT>
   Congressmen back from a secret trip to
Colombia say they are more convinced than ever that President
Virgilio Barco deserves unwavering support in his country's bloody
battle with drug traffickers.
   ``The Colombian people are inspiring, courageous,'' Rep. Frank
Guarini, D-N.J., said Friday on returning from the South American
nation. ``We will stand with them.''
   Guarini and five colleagues on the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, led by Chairman Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., said they saw firsthand a nation trying to resist
intimidation by a handful of powerful drug kingpins.
   Since Barco announced the anti-drug initiative three months ago,
Colombia has seen 50 judges, two newspaper publishers, the chief of
the narcotics police and a leading presidential candidate slain.
   Colombia got a fresh dose of violence Friday when police killed
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, one of the most powerful cocaine barons,
in a shootout near the port city of Covenas.
   Rodriguez Gacha, his 17-year-old son Fredy and five bodyguards
were slain in a gun battle on a ranch owned by Pablo Escobar,
godfather of Colombia's multibillion-dollar drug empire, Colombian
authorities said.
   At a news conference at Andrews Air Force Base, the lawmakers
praised Barco for his courage in the face of bombings and
assassinations that have chipped away at that nation's government.
   ``You have to be there to understand the kind of fear that we
saw,'' said Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J.
   They visited the site of last week's deadly bomb blast that
destroyed the Colombian Intelligence and Security Directorate, and
lawmakers visited a hospital where victims are recuperating.
   All agreed that despite death threats against top Colombian
officials, President Bush should attend a planned Feb. 15 drug
summit in the Colombian city of Cartagena to demonstrate U.S.
support for Barco's war against drug lords.
   Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., called the Bush visit ``a
strong symbolic gesture'' that would improve Colombian morale.
   ``We will collect our forces in the Congress to provide the type
of resources that will be necessary to make this war victorious,''
said Rangel.
   Hughes said he assured Barco the United States would assist
Colombia by restricting the flow of U.S.-made assault weapons and
cocaine processing chemicals to South America, limiting
money-laundering activities in the United States and providing
greater protection for witnesses willing to testify against drug
lords.
   Aides kept the two-day trip secret because of concerns the
congressmen could become the targets of cocaine traffickers.

   Two inmates said they broke out of prison
because life there was so dangerous they had no other choice to
protect themselves, and are suing the state for $1.8 million.
   In the damage suit filed in federal court this week, Jimmie
Perko and Neil Sleeper complained of widespread violence and lax
security inside the medium-security state prison at Moberly in
central Missouri, which they escaped Sept. 5. They were recaptured
two days later.
   ``A person can only put up with this constant fear for so long
until he is forced to seek safety; in this case it was to escape
the situation,'' the inmates said in the lawsuit.
   Perko, 28, is serving a 15-year sentence for robbery and other
charges. Sleeper, 31, is serving a 10-year term for first-degree
assault.
   They stated further that guards had failed to detect them
``tearing the window out of their cell'' and thus failed their duty
to keep the public safe from convicted felons.
   J.M. Jones, the prison superintendent, said Friday that both men
had been transferred to the Missouri Penitentiary in Jefferson
City. He said he was unaware of the lawsuit and declined to discuss
it.

<HEAD>Labor Department Wins Two Budget Battles for '91, Sources Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will increase spending
in fiscal 1991 for Labor Department job training programs and for
enforcement of pension and worker-safety laws.
   The increases will be included in the budget request the White
House sends Congress on Jan. 22 for the fiscal year that begins
next Oct. 1, sources told The Associated Press on Friday.
   The Labor Department lost in a bid for a major funding boost for
a program designed to help dislocated workers but welcomed the
overall spending and will not appeal the Office of Management and
Budget decisions to President Bush, said administration officials
who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The sources said the bottom line for the Labor Department budget
could change if some other major departments, the Defense
Department among them, win their appeals to the president for
funding above the levels decided by the budget office. That would
cause budget planners to look at other departments to recoup funds.
   The spending agreement for the Labor Department includes planned
funding boosts for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration.
   The figures are what the administration plans to request in
budget authority; actual appropriations are determined after
Congress adopts spending limits.
   The Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration oversees the
nation's nearly $2 trillion private pension system and has been
criticized by the department's inspector general, who says the
system is ripe for fraud because of inadequate oversight and
incomplete auditing of pension funds.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole asked for a more than $6 million
spending boost for the pension agency, according to the sources.
   They said the budget office accepted a figure ``very close'' to
the department's request and that as a result the agency would be
able to hire 100 additional enforcement workers in fiscal 1991.
   The department requested $15.7 million in additional funding for
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has a
budget authorization of $270 million for the current year. Again,
the sources declined to provide the amount approved by the budget
office but said it was ``essentially what we asked for'' and would
allow for the hiring of an undetermined number of new inspectors
and other enforcement personnel.
   Also included in department's agreement with the budget office
is $250 million in additional money for the Job Training
Partnership Act, which has a budget of about $1.7 billion this year.
   All of the new money would fund a package of job training
amendments pending before Congress and endorsed by Bush earlier
this year. Those changes are expected to be passed early next year.

   Terrance Wear will remain as the president of
the federal Legal Services Corp. after surviving a vote for his
ouster pushed by liberal members of the agency's board of directors.
   Former Rep. John Erlenborn, R-Ill., named to the panel by
President Bush last month, cast the deciding vote Friday against a
motion to dismiss Wear after a day-long meeting in which the
conservative president's performance was examined.
   The 11-member panel discussed Wear's use of outside counsel and
lobbying of the White House in connection with nominations for the
board. The panel also questioned Wear's hiring and payment of the
agency's inspector general without prior board approval.
   Erlenborn and Texas attorney J. Blakely Hall, who had previously
served on the board, were appointed during the year-end recess of
Congress, thus avoiding Senate confirmation.
   Friday's meeting was the latest in a continuing battle between
two factions on the board, which oversees the independent agency
that offers legal help to the nation's poor.
   The agency has been the subject of controversy since 1981, when
conservatives targeted it for abolishment.
   Now those conservatives, buttressed by Wear, want to limit the
agency's field attorneys' activities in class-action lawsuits
against the government over welfare and other social programs,
according to Carolyn Stewart of the National Legal Aid and
Defenders Association.
   Conservatives held a 6-5 majority on the board until two
vacancies recently occurred, according to Terry Roach, an
independent consultant and longtime LSC observer.
   The balance briefly tipped to a 5-4 majority in favor of the
broader range of activities, and one board member, Thomas Smegal,
unsuccessfully tried to oust Wear.

<TEXT>
   Range wars are nothing new to ranchers, but
hit-and-run vandalism that the FBI blames on environmental
terrorists is igniting new conflict in the West.
   ``It's a case of ecological terrorism,'' FBI agent Richard
Whitaker said of a growing number of incidents, including
castration of cattle, sabotage of farm machinery, freeing of farm
animals and possibly death threats against a rancher and a
government animal manager.
   ``Their basic goal is to eradicate the rancher,'' Whitaker said.
   The attacks have become more prevalent in Nevada, California and
Arizona in recent months. Some ranchers say damage they previously
thought was the work of pranksters or hunters may be a concerted
effort by animal rights activists and environmental groups.
   ``These things are terrorist activities,'' says Jim Connelley,
president of the Nevada Cattlemen's Association. ``These people
have total disregard for the law. They are criminal and terrorist
in nature.''
   Animal rights and environmental groups such as Animal Liberation
Front and Earth First! have been accused of the hit-and-run
attacks, which have been stepped up in the last 18 months, Whitaker
said in a recent interview here.
   The Animal Liberation Front _ best known for freeing research
animals and vandalizing laboratories _ is seeking ``the elimination
of the livestock industry,'' spokeswoman Margo Tannenbaum said.
   ``The reason why the Animal Liberation Front is conducting
economic sabotage to the poultry and livestock industries is to
encourage those involved to quit and follow other pursuits,'' she
said.
   Earth First! adherents may be responsible for some of the acts,
said spokesman Lynn Jacobs in Tucson. But Jacobs denied knowledge
of specific attacks by followers of the militant environmental
group.
   ``I don't advocate that anyone break the law unless they feel
it's the right thing to do,'' Jacobs said.
   The FBI's Whitaker said any livestock operator is a potential
target for militant vegetarians who shun meat, dairy products, eggs
or cheese, refuse to wear leather or wool and think others should
follow suit.
   Among the incidents in Nevada, according to cattleman Connelley,
are castration of bulls kept for breeding, cutting of fences and
water pipelines, toppling of troughs and water tanks and damage to
windmills and wells.
   Pam Neal, executive vice president of the Arizona Cattlemen's
Association in Phoenix, said she received a death threat on her
telephone answering machine a week after she testified at a
congressional hearing in favor of multiple uses of public land. She
blames the threat on ecological terrorists.
   Darrell Juve, the Arizona director of a U.S. Agriculture
Department program to kill predators and diseased animals, said he
also received a death threat, and later a military ``practice''
grenade was tossed into offices near his.
   Ranchers want Congress and state legislatures to make it a
felony to disrupt food production in any way.
   ``My assessment is that they're totally misguided, they don't
have the foggiest idea of the benefits of the livestock industry,''
Connelley said of the activists. ``We are the original ecologists.
We're the ones who originally came West, took it on ourselves to
produce something from nothing. We are dependent on the ecology.
   ``Some of these people are cooped up in an apartment in the big
city and the closest they ever get to nature is a Sunset magazine.
They tend to get a little misguided.''
   Animal Liberation Front members prefer releasing animals to
damaging equipment, Ms. Tannenbaum said. Each year they try to raid
turkey farms before Thanksgiving and rabbit farms before Easter.
   Front activists released 300 wild horses from a federal Bureau
of Land Management lot in northern California and beef cattle from
a feedlot in Coalinga, Calif. last year, she said.
   The group also claimed responsibility for freeing more than 600
partridges in May from pens belonging to Chukars Unlimited, a
hunters' group near Elko, Nev., that keeps the birds to be shot.
Many of the released birds were killed by vehicles on a nearby
highway.

<HEAD>Bush Nixes Proposal to Ground Airborne Command Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will keep the airborne command
post that flies continuously in case of nuclear attack despite a
Pentagon recommendation that the flights be grounded part of the
time.
   An administration official, who disclosed Bush's decision to The
Associated Press on condition he not be identified, said the
president and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft discussed
the matter after word of the Pentagon's plans appeared in Friday
editions of The New York Times.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney telegraphed the decision earlier
Friday, telling reporters, ``I don't believe we'll go forward with
it. ... I think we'll continue to fly it as we have in the past.''
   They decided that to end the flights would send ``the wrong
signal at this time, that we may be cutting back in military
capability,'' the official said.
   The administration's plans to seek lower defense budgets have
been known for weeks.
   A decreased Soviet threat and the prospect of saving $20 million
a year were cited as support for the proposal to ground the command
post, known as ``Looking Glass.''
   The post carries a general of the Strategic Air Command and
supporting staff to issue battle orders in case of a nuclear war
that kills or disables the president and other command authorities.
   The Looking Glass planes have been flying since 1961. The Air
Force proposed that they fly only part of the time, with the
general and his staff on ground alert the rest of the time.
   The planes fly from Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The veil of secrecy over the government's
38-year-old program at the Nevada Test Site has lifted some, in
part thanks to the efforts of two lawyers seeking compensation for
radiation victims since 1970.
   Brothers Alan and Larry Johns have unearthed top-secret
government files that show workers were repeatedly exposed to
dangerous levels of radiation but seldom told of the threat it
presented.
   The documents tell stories of the cavalier approach to radiation
that prevailed in the early nuclear years _ attitudes that might be
funny if it weren't for the tragedy involved. They talk of managers
who told miners to drink beer to flush tritium from their bodies,
and workers so unconcerned about the radiation they received that
they would hide their exposure badges so they wouldn't be pulled
off the job.
   ``That happened all the time,'' Johns said Friday. ``They would
just pretend to lose them so they could continue working and not
lose any money.''
   In 1961, the documents show, miners yanked from tunnels used
during nuclear weapons testing were told to drink as much beer as
possible to rid their bodies of radiation.
   That incident was retold by a miner in an affidavit and backed
up by tunnel logs prepared by Reynolds Electrical and Engineering
Co., the prime contractor at the site.
   ``It was their way to flush out the tritium,'' said Alan Johns
on Thursday. ``They'd give them a beer allotment and let them have
all the beer they could drink. They reimbursed one miner who turned
in $25 in receipts for beer over a weekend. And that was when beer
was a dollar a six-pack.''
   From the time a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb leaked a cloud of
radiation that enveloped several hundred workers three miles from
the blast site in 1970, the two attorneys have waged a protracted
legal struggle on behalf of those who believe they got cancer from
radiation released by nuclear bombs.
   Today, they represent two cases involving 200 workers who
allegedly died from cancer caused by the radiation and another 18
who contracted the disease. The suits continue to bounce between
various courts with no settlement in sight.
   ``It's just like a treadmill; it just keeps going from one step
to another,'' Alan Johns said. ``The radiation program is the
government's sacred cow. They've fought it every step of the way.''
   Alan Johns won a major ruling in the two separate cases in
October when a federal judge in Las Vegas said the government's
nuclear testing program can be held liable for not providing for
the health and safety of employees at the testing facility.
   If the ruling stands up on yet another appeal to the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, the widows of two men exposed to
radiation in the 1970 Baneberry nuclear test leak could get a new
trial on their claims. In the first trial, in 1979, a judge found
the government might have been negligent but was not responsible
for the cancers.
   While the cases have cost the two former prosecutors countless
hours of time and made them almost no money over the years, they
have uncovered some nuggets on how the government conducted itself
during the first two decades of testing at the nation's nuclear
proving grounds.
   In 1953, two years after testing began in the barren desert some
100 miles north of Las Vegas, documents show that commissioners on
the Atomic Energy Commission, predecessor of the Department of
Energy, advised lowering the government's annual safety limit,
which was 12 rems, for radiation doses.
   The commission's chief health officer advised against it, saying
it would require major changes in the way nuclear weapons were
tested at the site.
   The current safety level is now 5 rems.
   ``Granted, things would be done differently today but that's the
way life is,'' said DOE spokesman Chris West. ``The government was
following the existing safety standards of the day. As you learn
more about the environment and health, you change your standards to
deal with the new information.''

<TEXT>
   The Smithsonian Institution for the first time
in its 143-year history is seeking corporate support for its vast
educational and research activities as a permanent supplement to
federal financing.
   The Smithsonian recently announced the creation of a Corporation
Associate Program, intended to raise more than $1 million annually
through corporate contributions or membership dues.
   The founding chairman of the new fund-raising venture, which
starts next year, will be Roberto C. Goizueta, chairman and chief
executive officer of the Coca-Cola Co.
   Coca-Cola pledged the maximum $25,000 in membership dues under
the new corporate program, which allows companies to cosponsor a
major special event at the Smithsonian. Corporations choosing to
pay annual dues of $10,000 will be entitled to VIP treatment at
Smithsonian events.
   In the past, corporate support of the Smithsonian has been
confined mostly to underwriting specific museum exhibits or
projects. The new program is intended to generate unrestricted
funds for the whole range of Smithsonian activities, including its
14 museums and art galleries, the National Zoo and various other
educational and research facilities.
   Smithsonian officials said the institution's current
congressional appropriation of $266.7 million is insufficient to
finance several ambitious new initiatives.

<NOTE>Average Japanese Income Tops U.S.; Still Behind Switzerland</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. national income, figured on the basis of
population, rose slightly in 1988 but was far outpaced by Japan,
the World Bank says.
   Per capita income in the United States last year was $19,780,
compared with $18,580 in 1987. In Japan, the income rose from
$15,840 to $21,040, the World Bank reported Friday. The bank gave
all incomes in U.S. dollars.
   The World Bank arrives at its figures by dividing the value of a
country's total production, the gross national product, by its
population. Per capita income thus includes people without income,
such as children, and non-wage income, such as returns on
investments.
   The Swiss continued to rank first in per capita income with a
1988 average of $27,260, up from $21,310 in 1987.
   Mozambique ranked lowest among the 152 members of the World Bank
with a 1988 annual per capita income of $100.
   The United States, which in 1987 ranked second only to
Switzerland in per capita income, was fifth last year, behind
Switzerland, Japan, Iceland and Norway.
   Much of the rise in the Japanese income can be attributed to an
increase in the value of the yen in comparison with the dollar, as
well as to increased Japanese production. Elsewhere, differences
could be linked to shifts in the value of the dollar compared with
other currencies. The dollar has been rising in 1989 after a fall
that began in 1985.

<NOTE>Study Finds Deepening Hardship Among Latino Families, Children</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study released says the economic
expansion of the 1980s has least benefited U.S. Latinos.
   Nearly one-fifth of Hispanic families are living in poverty as
the decade ends, according to the study released Friday by the
National Council of La Raza.
   The study found widespread poverty among Hispanic families led
by women, deepening hardships for married-couple families and
significant numbers of poor Latino children.
   ``Hispanics made many gains in the 1980s, politically and
socially, especially in visibility and growth,'' said La Raza
president Raul Yzaguirre. ``But unfortunately, the economic picture
for Hispanics worsened at the same time.''
   La Raza, a non-profit Hispanic research and advocacy
organization, said Hispanics were concentrated in low-wage jobs,
overrepresented in industries with declining employment and more
likely to lose their jobs through plant closings.
   Hispanics also are the most undereducated group in the country,
with only 51 percent of Latinos 25 and older completing four years
of high school or more, compared with 78 percent of non-Hispanics.
   The increasing number of Hispanic families led by women is also
a factor, as those families tend to be poor, the study said. In
1980, 21.8 percent of Hispanic families were led by women, but by
1988, women-led families accounted for 23.4 percent of Hispanic
families.

   Marines working with U.S. Border Patrol
agents exchanged gunfire with a group of drug smugglers on
horseback in the first battle between troops and smugglers since
the military began border patrols, officials said.
   The Marines did not shoot to kill, and no one was injured in the
half-hour fight Wednesday night outside this border city, officials
said Friday.
   The Marines were part of a 50-soldier contingent who have been
assisting Border Patrol agents, primarily in surveillance, since
the program started two weeks ago, Lt. Col. Ron Stokes said from
Marine headquarters in Washington.
   The contingent was on its way to an observation point about
three miles from Nogales when the horsemen were spotted, Stokes
said.
   The Border Patrol agent ordered the Marines to fire a flare to
light up the area, Stokes said. With the ground lighted, the men on
horseback began shooting at the Marines.
   The Marines, armed with M-16 assault rifles, returned the
volley, firing over the heads of smugglers ``in order to try to
scare their horses,'' Stokes said.
   After the riders fled, Marines and Border Patrol agents
confiscated about 570 pounds of marijuana.
   Bob Maynes, a spokesman for Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said
the firefight underlined the reasons why federal troops should be
involved against drug smugglers.
   ``The willingness of drug smugglers to fire across an
international border when no shots had been fired at them is a
clear indication of the dangerous kind of individuals we're dealing
with,'' Maynes said.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, which directs
the Border Patrol, announced in October that it planned to use
Marines to aid in drug interdiction.
   At the time, Hispanic rights groups voiced concerns that Marines
on the border would prompt increased violence and human rights
abuses because Marines are not trained in civilian law enforcement.
   The Mexican government also raised concerns.
   The Marines do not have the authority to arrest people or
conduct searches and seizures, Stokes said.
   Local police said they were not notified of the gunfight.
   Capt. Tony Estrada of the Nogales, Ariz., police said the
confrontation was ``news to me until I received a call from a
reporter.''
   Both city police and the sheriff's department are normally
notified by federal officials when shootings take place in their
areas.

<TEXT>
   Redoubt Volcano belched an 8-mile-high
cloud of ash that turned day to night in a town 200 miles away and
apparently clogged all four engines of an airliner, forcing an
emergency landing.
   The mountain 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, which ended a
23-year slumber with an eruption Thursday, erupted twice Friday,
and could continue to spew ash, said seismologists with the U.S.
Geological Survey.
   The huge plume of ash was tentatively blamed for the failure of
all four engines on a Boeing 747 passenger jet that made a safe
emergency landing here at 12:25 p.m. Friday, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
   Engines on the KLM Royal Dutch Airlines plane traveling from
Amsterdam stopped after the aircraft passed through volcanic ash
undetected by radar, FAA spokeswoman Mary Lou Wojtalik said.
   The plane fell 13,000 feet before all engines were restarted and
Flight 867 landed without injury to the 245 people aboard, she said.
   The massive ash cloud drifted at noon over the town of
Talkeetna, a staging point for Mount McKinley climbers that lies
about 200 miles northeast of the volcano, blotting out the sun and
depositing 3 inches of ash on the ground.
   ``It blotted out the sun,'' said Brad Ault, a dispatcher with
the state troopers. ``It was like night for about an hour.''
   Redoubt erupted early Friday morning and again shortly after 10
a.m. Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey were unable to
reach the remote site in Lake Clark National Park by plane because
of bad weather and had to depend on instruments that measure ground
motion to track the eruptions.
   The volcano is of a type that erupts explosively, throwing ash
and rocks skyward.
   More eruptions are possible, said USGS geologist Don Richter.
   ``I don't like to use the word `normal,' but a group of
eruptions is typical of a volcano,'' Richter said.
   Friday's late-morning eruption shook the ground for miles, said
Charlotte Rowe, a seismologist at the University of Alaska
Fairbanks Geophysical Institute. The corrosive ash fallout bypassed
Anchorage and drifted to the northeast, as it had a day earlier.
   Much of the cloud _ which reached heights of 40,000 feet, or
about 8 miles _dissipated.
   The Alaska Division of Emergency Services said any remaining ash
was expected to move into Canada, then turn south.
   Talkeetna bartender Shannon Tobiason said most people remained
indoors.
   ``This place is covered,'' Tobiason said. ``There's about 3
inches (of ash) on the car windshields. Everything here is brown
and there is a sulfur smell.''
   In Anchorage, the international airport remained open, although
some carriers suspended or reduced operations. The FAA continued to
restrict flying in the area of the volcano. The agency said the KLM
plane was where it was supposed to be when it passed through the
ash.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of fans, many in antebellum costume,
turned out to re-create the festivities surrounding the premiere of
``Gone With the Wind'' on the 50th anniversary of the release of
the Civil War movie classic.
   Some of the original cast was on hand for the gala
``re-premiere'' Friday night, but the movie itself was the star of
the show.
   The crowd applauded everything, from the title as it swept
across the screen to the stars' names as the credits rolled.
   Andy Diskes of Peabody, Mass., who came dressed in a Confederate
uniform, didn't care that he had seen the movie many times before.
This time was special.
   ``I thought that by being here I could be part of its history,''
he said.
   Ten surviving cast members _ all had minor roles _ were on hand.
   Olivia de Havilland, who played Melanie Wilkes, sent a letter to
be read to the audience in which she said stars Clark Gable and
Vivien Leigh would live on through the film, and ``I'll be with you
too.''
   Gable, who played Rhett Butler, and Miss Leigh, who portrayed
Scarlett O'Hara, both died in the 1960s. Margaret Mitchell, the
Atlanta author whose Pulitzer Prize-winning novel became one of the
world's most popular movies, died in 1949.
   When the surviving cast members were introduced by talk show
host Larry King, the loudest applause went to Butterfly McQueen,
the child-voiced actress who played the slave Prissy.
   Miss McQueen was barred from the 1939 premiere, held in a
whites-only theater. But on Friday night, she entertained the crowd
with lines from her role and a song to the tune of the ``Tara''
theme.
   Fans from as far away as Australia came for the event, but the
crowd was far smaller than the hundreds of thousands who turned out
for the Dec. 15, 1939, premiere at Loews Grand Theatre.
   This time, only a few hundred people gathered in cold, cloudy
weather to watch a re-creation of the motorcade.
   And the parade didn't head for the Loews Grand, torn down after
it was gutted by fire in 1978. Its stand-in was the Fox Theatre, an
ornate 1920s movie palace restored in the 1970s.
   Before the screening, the cast members helped cut a huge cake in
the shape of the plantation Tara. Joining them was Daniel Selznick,
son of the late ``Gone With the Wind'' producer, David O. Selznick.
   Ted Turner, the media mogul who acquired the movie in 1985 when
he bought MGM-UA Entertainment Corp.'s huge film empire, had little
to say at the screening.
   But Thursday night, at an anniversary ball at the Georgia
International Convention and Trade Center, he had a quip for those
who disliked his practice of adding color to many classic
black-and-white movies.
   ``All I can say is, thank God they shot `Gone With the Wind' in
color,'' he said.

   A blast from the engines of a private jet

   The Gulfstream 3 executive jet moved to within about 20 yards of
the Copacabana restaurant at Lindbergh Field as it positioned
itself for takeoff Friday night. When it departed, the engine
acceleration produced a wind blast that broke a large glass window,
police Sgt. Dave Douglas said.
   ``The people in there were showered with the broken glass,''
Douglas said.
   Of the injured, eight were transported to hospitals and the rest
treated at the scene. Douglas said most of the injuries involved
cuts or twisted ankles.

   A Chinese couple hijacked an Air China jumbo jet
bound for New York with 223 people on board Saturday and the
aircraft was forced to land in western Japan, authorities said. The
hijackers, a man and woman, were arrested.
   The passengers and crew were reported safe.
   The Boeing 747 left Beijing on Saturday morning and made a stop
in Shanghai, then abruptly diverted from its course, a Japanese
Foreign Ministery official said.
   The couple, traveling with a child, demanded to be flown to
Taiwan, but Taiwan refused permission for the aircraft to land,
Japanese officials said.
   South Korea also refused permission for the aircraft to land,
and it flew on to Japan, South Korean officials said.
   The aircraft finally landed at Fukuoka, 560 miles southwest of
Tokyo on Japan's westernmost main island of Kyushu, at 2:52 p.m.
(12:52 a.m.) after the pilot said he only had 40 minutes of fuel
left, Japanese officials said.
   They said the crew overpowered the woman hijacker on the plane
after the male hijacker jumped to the tarmac below.
   The man, who was injured and taken to a hospital, told Japanese
officials he was one of the hijackers, and gave his age as 36, a
Transport Ministry official said.
   Japan Broadcasting Corp. showed a man lying face-down on the
tarmac and being rushed into a local hospital. The network said the
man gave his name as Zhang Haixin and that the other two hijackers
were his wife and child.
   The network quoted Zhang as saying he belonged to a group called
the ``China Working Nine.''
   The motive for the hijacking was not immediately clear.
   In Beijing, an official with the Civil Aviation Administration
of China said the couple was Chinese and that the passengers on the
plane were safe. The official said the plane would return to
Beijing and that the flight would set out again for New York on
Sunday.
   The official, who refused to give his name, said he was not sure
what weapon, if any, the hijackers had. He said Chinese and
Japanese officials were discussing their fate.
   The airport was closed to all traffic, and all flights heading
toward Fukuoka were being diverted elsewhere, the public network
said.
   A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said there were 223 people
on the plane when it was hijacked.
   The flight had been scheduled to leave Beijing at 10 a.m. (9
p.m. EST) and stop at Shanghai before going on to New York.
   Chinese sources said it was hijacked after the Shanghai stop.
Japan Broadcasting said the aircraft was hijacked before landing in
Shanghai.
   Japan Broadcasting said the hijackers first demanded to fly to
Taiwan, seat of the Nationalist Chinese government, but were
refused permission by Taiwan authorities.
   China Air Flight 981 then tried to land in South Korea but was
rejected by South Korean authorities, said a Foreign Ministry
official, who by custom would not be identified by name.
   Taiwan and South Korea have no diplomatic relations with China.
   The aircraft entered South Korean airspace over the southernmost
island of Cheju before turning toward Japan, a South Korean Defense
Ministry official said.
   In 1983, six Chinese hijacked a plane to South Korea. They were
imprisoned for less than a year and resettled in Taiwan, where they
received heroes' welcomes.
   Two men hijacked another domestic flight to Taiwan in May 1988.
A hijacking attempt in April failed when the pilot pretended to
comply with the hijacker's demand to go to Taiwan, but instead
landed at the mainland city of Fuzhou. The hijacker committed
suicide by detonating explosives strapped to his back.

   A car bomb severely injured a well-known criminal
attorney with a lengthy list of clients including drug dealers and
rightist Cuban militants.
   Gino P. Negretti, 71, pushed himself out of his wrecked car and
was aided by neighbors who rushed to help when his late-model
Cadillac exploded shortly after he started it Friday morning.
   Negretti narrowly escaped flames that engulfed the car after the
blast in a residential section of Miami, police spokesman David

   Investigators have begun checking Negretti's client list, Rivero
said.
   ``He's pretty well known as a defense attorney, and a lot of his
clients are drug defendants,'' said Rivero. ``Obviously, that's one
of the angles that will be checked. Maybe he had a problem with one
of his clients.''
   Neighbor Juan Cardenas said the explosion was ``very, very
loud.''
   ``That's why I ran outside,'' he said. ``Then we saw the flames
and smoke. He's a fortunate man.''
   Negretti was rushed into surgery at Jackson Memorial Hospital,
where doctors removed shrapnel from his arms and legs, Rivero said.
Both of Negretti's arms were broken but none of his vital organs
appeared to have been hit, he said.
   The Puerto Rican-born attorney has been well known in Miami
legal circles for decades, repesenting defendants in prominent
cases involving the city's Cuban-American community.
   Negretti defended anti-Castro activist Humberto Lopez Jr., who
fled to the Dominican Republic while appealing a conviction for
illegal possession of explosives.
   He was one of the attorneys who in 1967 represented six men
convicted of an attempted invasion of part of Haiti in a plan to
set up a base for launching anti-Castro actions against Cuba.

<HEAD>Launch of Space Shuttle Columbia Delayed One More Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA hopes the pre-Christmas launch
of space shuttle Columbia on a satellite rescue mission will take
place Thursday.
   ``There's still a lot of work to do between now and then, but we
are reasonably confident of launch on the 21st,'' Robert L.
Crippen, director of the space shuttle program, said Friday in
announcing the change.
   The one-day postponement followed an announcement on Wednesday
of a two-day postponement. If the shuttle is not launched by Dec.
23, liftoff would be delayed until at least Dec. 27 to free workers
for the Christmas holiday.
   The delays have been prompted mainly by unfinished work on
launch pad 39A, which hasn't been used for a shuttle launch in
nearly four years. The complex recently completed a two-year, $50
million refurbishment, and it has taken technicians longer than
expected to validate fuel lines and other systems.
   Some tiny fuel leaks and other minor problems have turned up,
slowing work.
   During 10 days in space, Columbia's five astronauts are to
release a communications satellite for the Navy and then track down
and retrieve a large science payload before it falls to Earth. The
payload has been orbiting for six years and is scheduled to reenter
the atmosphere in March.
   Astronaut Dan Brandenstein is the crew commander. The others are
pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha
Ivins and David Low.

   The NAACP was expecting President Bush and snow.
Neither arrived, but the organization's 80th anniversary party went
on anyway.
   Bush's arrival for the Friday night fete was viewed with
trepidation by some city officials who said it and forecast snow
would create gridlock on streets mobbed with holiday shoppers.
   Bush got a case of laryngitis and stayed in Washington, but put
in an appearance through a long-distance hook-up with the audience
at the Waldorf-Astoria.
   He said he wanted the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People to work with his administration in combatting
drugs, improving educational opportunities and helping the homeless.
   During his brief telephone remarks, Bush repeatedly apologized
for not attending the $500-a-person dinner.
   ``Even our dog thinks I look sick as a dog,'' he said to laughs.
   Bush promised to ``use my office to speak out against racism and
bigotry wherever it is found as long as I am president of the
United States.''
   Benjamin Hooks, NAACP executive director, said the president's
absence should not be misconstrued.
   ``He is a man who is trying to lead us to become a gentler,
kinder nation,'' Hooks said. ``I want you to know the NCAAP stands
ready to achieve that goal and purpose.''
   Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan stepped in
for Bush at the last minute and quoted from portions of Bush's
prepared speech, urging the NAACP to join forces with the Bush
administration.
   Prominent officials attending the event included David Dinkins,
the first black elected mayor of New York, and Virginia Gov.-elect
L. Douglas Wilder, who last month became the first elected black
governor in the nation.

<HEAD>Boesky To Finish Sentence At Brooklyn Halfway House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ivan F. Boesky, Wall Street's most famous felon,
has been released from a federal prison camp and will serve the
rest of his sentence at a halfway house, authorities said.
   Boesky, 52, was granted a transfer to the house about 10 days
ago from the minimum-security Lompoc Federal Prison Camp in
California, where he had been imprisoned since March 1988, prison
spokesman Gavin O'Connor said Friday.
   Boesky actually has been out of the Lompoc prison since early
November, when he received a monthlong furlough for good behavior.
During his time out, Boesky became eligible for a transfer to the
less-restrictive halfway house.
   The former Wall Street stock speculator was photographed by the
New York Post last month in Stamford, Conn., wearing
shoulder-length gray hair and a long, scraggly beard. He was
spotted in New York City last week wearing a business suit, with
his hair and beard neatly trimmed.
   ``He fulfills the requirement for release at the halfway
house,'' O'Connor said. ``That's the regular procedure.''
   At his new quarters, Boesky has an evening curfew and must
arrange his activities through supervisors.
   Leon Silverman, one of Boesky's attorneys, confirmed that Boesky
had been released to the halfway house but declined further comment.
   In November 1986, Boesky paid $100 million to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and agreed to plead guilty to one criminal
count to settle charges related to a large insider-trading network.
   He was sentenced to three years in prison and is eligible for
release on good behavior next April after completing two-thirds of
his term.
   Boesky is cooperating with the government and is expected to
testify against former junk bond financier Michael Milken, whose
trial is set for next year.
   At Lompoc, Boesky generally worked on a prison cleanup crew that
took care of the visitor areas. He was paid 11 cents an hour for
his labor.
   ``He's a nice man, to be perfectly honest,'' O'Connor said. ``He
was a good man to have around. A good man to speak to. Always
pleasant.''
   Boesky is renovating his home on a 75-acre estate north of New
York City. The building permit for the work puts the estimated cost
of the project at about $1.22 million.
   A group of local union workers has picketed the building for two
weeks to protest non-union work being done on the mansion.

   Ninety-nine years after his death,
followers of the Sioux leader Sitting Bull paid tribute to his
spirit with a ceremony in the numbing cold and began a 15-day
spiritual pilgrimage over the frozen Plains.
   About 20 people gathered Friday at a granite marker on the
Standing Rock Indian Reservation, near where the chief was buried
Dec. 15, 1890, the day he died in a shootout with Indian police.
   With temperatures of 22 below zero, the group shared a peace
pipe and blessings with smoke and ashes from a bowl of cedar chips
and sweet grass. They talked of Sitting Bull's legacy.
   ``Sitting Bull fought the U.S. government, who sent their best
army to capture us. It never happened,'' said Isaac Dog Eagle, a
descendant of the chief who blessed the site and prayed to ``the
grandfathers'' for protection.
   At the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn, the Sioux helped defeat
the 7th Cavalry troops led by George Armstrong Custer, killing
Custer and all his soldiers.
   Before his death, Sitting Bull had united Indians in the late
1800s in their fight against being placed on reservations.
   After the ceremony, 10 Fort Yates runners formed a relay team to
McLaughlin, S.D., about 25 miles south of Fort Yates. Their journey
was to be continued by four men and a woman on horseback from
Sitting Bull's old campsite near McLaughlin, in a 15-day pilgrimage
to Wounded Knee, S.D.
   It was at Wounded Knee, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation,
where Sitting Bull's followers were killed in a battle with
Custer's old cavalry command on Dec. 29, 1890.
   The five riders from North Dakota were to be met by 13 others in
South Dakota, commemorating the journey of Sitting Bull's
followers. Mark White Bull, 40, of Fort Yates, a member of the
group, said they were riding for spiritual rebirth.
   ``We're going to ride for the people, suffer for the people, so
that our people may live,'' he said.
   ``We have something to offer the whole world. We have this to
share with the society ... to go back to basic values.''
   It was the third year the relay had taken place.
   Sitting Bull's original grave was excavated in the 1960s, when
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made a parking area for the
historic site, White Bull said. The whereabouts of the chief's
remains have been debated for years after reports that a South
Dakota group tried to remove them in the 1950s.
   The U.S. Postal Service, which co-sponsored Friday's event,
issued a Sitting Bull commemorative stamp earlier this year.
   After the ceremony at the marker, Dog Eagle told Fort Yates
students in the warmth of a Standing Rock Community College
auditorium that they should be proud of their heritage.
   He said drugs, alcohol and dependence on non-Indian society have
weakened the Indian nation's spirit and independence.
   ``The only way we survive is if we go back to being a real
Indian,'' he said.

   A siren-red, sequin-encrusted evening gown that
gentlemen preferred to see Marilyn Monroe wearing fetched $14,300
at an auction of Hollywood memorabilia.
   The dress worn in ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' was sold Friday
to an unidentified buyer at Sotheby's auction house. The
unidentified seller also threw in a Life magazine cover showing
Miss Monroe in the gown and Jane Russell in an identical one.
   A white lace bustier, which Miss Monroe wore under a different
gown in the 1960 movie ``Let's Make Love,'' went for $1,430. And a
black bra, of unspecified origin but inscribed with the sex
symbol's name, sold for $605.
   The beauty got some competition from a beast: a rubber monster
head from the 1954 movie, ``The Creature of the Black Lagoon.'' A
Canadian private collector got it for $5,610 _ well above the
pre-sale estimate of $2,000 to $3,000.
   The monster mask, in fetching sea green with red lips, is
highlighted by ``many gills to the back'' and large moles, the
auction catalog notes. When not being worn, it can be displayed in
its own clear case.
   A Salvador Dali backdrop from Alfred Hitchcock's ``Spellbound,''
valued at $60,000 to $80,000, was bought back when it failed to
make the undisclosed minimum. So was a navy blue and white checked,
cotton pinafore worn by Judy Garland in the ``Wizard of Oz,'' which
the auctioneers had hoped would go for $20,000 to $25,000.
   But an anonymous buyer paid $6,600 for a leather chariot toga
worn by Charlton Heston in ``Ben Hur,'' circa 1959. Brown leather
forearm covers and a blue, 9-foot cape complete the macho ensemble.
   And W.C. Fields's top hat from the 1939 movie, ``My Little
Chickadee,'' went for $3,300 to a private collector _ a bargain,
below the estimate of $4,000 to $6,000.
   The Hollywood mementos were part of Sotheby's annual Collector's
Carrousel sale that also includes toys, dolls, animated art, music
boxes and baseball memorabilia. The sale continued today.

   A businessman arrested for investigation of
making threats against a former employee was linked by police to
death squads in El Salvador, authorities said.
   Carlos Rene Mata, 35, was being held Friday after arraignment on
charges he made a terrorist threat and received stolen property.
   Mata, owner of the Pipil Express international overnight
delivery company, was not charged in connection with death squad
activities.
   An affidavit filed in Municipal Court by police Detective Steve
Spear said ``confidential, reliable'' sources have linked Mata to
the death squads.
   Mata's attorney, Donald C. Randolph, denied his client was
involved in death squads and said he was being victimized by
authorities for his links to the Republican Nationalist Alliance,
the rightist party in power in El Salvador.
   Opponents of the U.S.-supported government in El Salvador have
blamed three Los Angeles kidnappings on Salvadoran death squads. In
the last two years, Catholic churches in the region have received
more than 100 threatening letters and phone calls, police said.
   Mata and a male employee of Pipil Express were ordered in
November to stand trial for the alleged rape of a 24-year-old woman
in the company's Pico-Union district office.
   Last month, Mata pleaded guilty to federal charges he used his
firm to smuggle illegal immigrants into the United States.
   And on Thursday, Mata was arraigned on charges he made a
threatening phone call to a former employee who had cooperated with
authorities investigating the illegal immigrant smuggling.
   He was also charged in connection with two stolen Mercedez-Benz
automobiles found at his home. Bail was set at on $500,000.

   A lesbian has lost a lawsuit for joint
custody and visitation rights to a girl born to her former lover
through artificial insemination with sperm from the plaintiff's
brother.
   The plaintiff, Terri Sabol, sought the rights of a parent and
even offered to pay child support.
   Ruling Friday after a non-jury trial, Superior Court Judge Dana
Henry said the case ventured into uncharted legal ground, and
added, ``it is absolutely imperative that the Legislature
re-examine its laws.''
   ``I'm shocked, really shocked,'' said Sabol, 33, owner of a Long
Beach hair salon and the only party in the case who was publicly
identified.
   The child was referred to as Baby B and her mother was
identified only as Susan. The trial was conducted behind closed
doors, as is usual in cases determining parental rights, but the
judge ruled in open court.
   Sabol will appeal, said her attorney, Gloria Allred.
   ``We believe that persons who are gay and lesbian have the right
to be parents,'' Ms. Allred said. ``Ms. Sabol became a parent in
the only way that she could.''
   Allred argued that her client deserved parental rights under a
legal doctrine that recognizes a parent-child bond between a child
and person who acts as a parent but is neither the biological or
adoptive parent.
   Henry ruled Sabol failed to prove such a bond existed.
   The mother's lawyer, Glen Schwartz, said the ruling was
consistent with state law.
   Testimony showed Susan was the mother and Steve Sabol was the
biological father.
   Sabol and her ``life partner'' decided in March 1985 they wanted
a child. Part of the decision was that the other woman would carry
the baby because Sabol ``was in a better position to be the bread
winner,'' Allred said.
   Sabol's brother, Steve, donated sperm for the artificial
insemination procedure, which was performed by Sabol.
   The other woman became pregnant in April 1986 and a girl was
born Dec. 16, 1986. The child's parentage made Sabol the girl's
aunt.
   Allred said Sabol supported her partner through her pregnancy
and served as a parent until the women's relationship broke up in
July 1988.

<HEAD>Pinochet Offers Full Support to Elected Successor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet promised support to
his newly elected civilian successor but said that the military
would keep watch over the system he set up during his 16 years of
iron rule.
   Pinochet's nationwide address showed that the voters' defeat of
his government's policies in balloting Thursday would not mean that
the right-wing army commander would easily turn over total power to
president-elect Patricio Aylwin.
   Pinochet said, ``We offer all our collaboration, not only out of
respect for those who triumphed in yesterday's elections but also
out of loyalty to the country's higher interests, which have always
guided my actions.''
   He added that the armed forces would rule ``until the last day
of their mandate'' and then would assume a watchdog role ``to
guarantee the institutional order of the republic.''
   A triumphant Aylwin told hundreds of thousands of supporters
Friday night that he would insist on the obedience of Pinochet and
the armed forces once he takes office in March.
   ``We want to see the armed forces dedicated to their
professional duties, disciplined, obedient, recovering the respect
of all their countrymen,'' Aylwin said.
   The election was intended to bring back democracy to the last
South American country still ruled by the military.
   Pinochet, who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled
elected President Salvador Allende, was forced to call the election
after losing a referendum in October 1988. Chileans in that vote
rejected a military proposal that he remain as president until 1997.
   In Washington, the State Department congratulated the people and
the government of Chile for the ``free and honest'' elections.
   ``The high voter turnout and the orderly and peaceful way in
which the elections were carried out testify to the strong desire
of the Chilean people to freely elect their political leadership,''
the department said in a statement.
   Late Friday, there were sporadic clashes with police, who
dispersed small groups of rock-throwing youths with tear gas and
water cannons. Police reported at least seven officers hurt and
dozens of demonstrators detained in the skirmishes downtown, which
lasted well into the night. Witnesses saw several injured civilians
taken off in ambulances.
   Aylwin led the ticket of a 17-party center-left coalition that
has fought for an end to Pinochet's authoritarian rule. Pinochet,
however, has vowed to stay on as army commander.
   A special constitutional clause bars any new govermment from
ousting Pinochet from the army command for eight years.
   Aylwin has maintained that the military should limit itself to
national defense and security matters.
   In a news conference, the president-elect declared his
government ``will not be a puppet democracy.''
   He also said he plans to meet with the armed forces before his
inauguration.
   One of the most delicate issues in future military-civilian
relations is expected to be an investigation of human rights abuses
during military rule.
   ``We don't have a wish of revenge, but of truth and justice,''
Aylwin said Friday. He also said anyone who committed abuses may be
brought to justice, including Pinochet.
   The 74-year-old general says he will not accept human rights
trials of servicemen, and has warned: ``If one of my men is
touched, the state of law will be broken.''
   Aylwin, 71, a Christian Democrat and former Senate leader, won
55.2 percent of the vote. Pro-government candidate Hernan Buchi
finished with 29.4 percent and a populist businessman, Francisco
Errazuriz, garnered the remaining 15.4 percent.
   Voters also picked members of the two-chamber congress, which
will reopen for the first time since the 1973 coup.
   According to results, Aylwin will have a 72-48 majority in the
120-seat House of Deputies. And although his coalition won 22 of
the 38 elected Senate seats, his government will not have a
majority. The administration is constitutionally empowered to
appoint up to 10 more senators.

<TEXT>
   In what amounted to a public apology, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Soviet leaders today eulogized Andrei D. Sakharov as
a ``man of honesty and sincerity'' who suffered great injustice at
the hands of previous rulers.
   An obituary signed by Gorbachev, five other members of the
ruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other leading officials and
scholars was printed along with a picture of Sakharov on page 4 of
the party daily Pravda.
   Such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and
scientists, and Pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 Nobel
Peace Prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a
funeral commission in a black box on its front page.
   Sakharov, 68, died Thursday night in his study, just hours after
urging fellow members of the Congress of People's Deputies to
create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its
seven-decade strangehold on political power.
   ``A distinguished scientist and public figure, a man of honesty
and sincerity has passed away,'' the obituary said. ``Everything
that Andrei Dmitrievich did was dictated by his conscience, his
deep humanitarian convictions.''
   The obituary noted Sakharov was exiled in the industrial city of
Gorky about 250 miles east of Moscow from 1980 to 1986.
   ``Gross injustices were permitted in relation to A.D.
Sakharov,'' it said.
   It was signed by Gorbachev and fellow Politburo members Nikolai
I. Ryzhkov, Vadim A. Medvedev, Lev N. Zaikov, Alexander N. Yakovlev
and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov.
   However, the signatures of several other Politburo members,
including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and leading conservative
Yegor K. Ligachev were missing. Absence of their signatures could
signify that the disagreed with part of the obituary.
   Ligachev, interviewed by the Tass news agency on Friday, had
said he disagreed with Sakharov but respected him.
   It was Leonid I. Brezhnev, now blamed by Gorbachev for
permitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the Soviet system,
who exiled Sakharov for criticizing the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan.
   Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told him
he could return to Moscow.
   The Soviet leader told reporters at the Congress of People's
Deputies that Sakharov's death was a ``great loss.''
   Even though the two often tangled at the Congress, Gorbachev
said he respected Sakharov. ``He was not some sort of political
intriguer,'' the Soviet president said Friday.
   Gorbachev said he would attend Sakharov's funeral Monday
afternoon in southwest Moscow's Vostryakovskoye Cemetery.
   Several hundred people gathered outside Sakharov's apartment
building Friday evening, holding candles and wreathing his
photograph in flowers. Memorial services were scheduled Sunday at
the city's main youth center, and on Monday at the Lebedev physics
institute where Sakharov worked and the Academy of Sciences, of
which he was a leading member.
   The popular nighttime TV program ``Vzglad'' showed a brief
interview with his widow, Yelena Bonner, discussing the funeral
arrangements.
   The obituary also praised Sakharov's vision as a scientist,
which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences
at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the
Soviet hydrogen bomb.
   But it said that Sakharov realized the danger of the weapon he
had helped create.
   ``Working on the creation of weapons of mass destruction, A.D.
Sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wide
production and testing, and stubbornly placed before the government
the question of limiting such tests,'' it said.
   ``But at that time his appeals were not accepted,'' it said.
``He kept these same positions in the future.''

judge refused to release details about the U.S. government's
investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 for use in a
lawsuit against the airline.
   Judge Thomas C. Platt of U.S. District Court said Friday the
information may have to be withheld until criminal investigations
here and overseas are completed _ which may delay the civil case
for years.
   ``I don't want to be responsible for another airline crash,'' he
said at a hearing.
   Pan Am attorney Anthony A. Dean argued that the case should be
delayed until the court can consider all the evidence about the
bomb, which destroyed Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec.
21, killing 259 on the plane and 11 on the ground.
   Lee Kreindler, the lead attorney for relatives of about 150 of
the dead, said it would be unfair to make the families wait that
long for their day in court. The plaintiffs are seeking amounts
ranging from $1 million to $25 million.
   Platt said he felt it might be a waste of time to begin the
trial without the government information, only to have it released
later.
   Pan Am last month subpoenaed six government agencies, including
the FBI and the CIA, seeking documents to use in defending itself
against the civil lawsuits.
   Platt said some of the documents he had reviewed contained
information that he felt might jeopardize American interests.
   He instructed Justice Department lawyer John Connors, who sat in
on the proceedings, to seek guidance from national security
officials in Washington and report back.
   ``I want you to find out if you released what evidence you have
now, without mentioning names, whether they would regard that as
breaching national security,'' Platt said.
   No date was set for Connors to report to Platt.
   Outside the courtroom, Dean said he felt the documents may show
that parties other than Pan Am, possibly even government agencies,
shared responsibility.

   So many Exxon oil-tanker crew members applied for
a company offer to pay them to quit their jobs that a possible
tanker-crew shortage could occur, a company spokesman said.
   Exxon sought the resignations of 76 licensed officers and 71
unlicensed crew members to make up for a cutback in ships and crew
sizes, but nearly twice the number of unlicensed crew members
applied for the buyout, said spokesman Tom Gillette in Houston.
   The number of officers who signed up for the buyout wasn't
available, he said.
   The company conducted the buy-out by seniority on Nov. 22, when
it named the 147 who would be bought out of their jobs, said John
Hillman, vice president of the Seaman's Union at Exxon.
   But since the buyout, other crew members and officers who were
not named on the list have quit because they are fed up with Exxon
policies, Hillman said.
   Gillette said Exxon may have to delay some of the buyouts since
so many people have quit. He did not say how many had quit.
   About 800 people worked in the company's tanker operation before
the buyout plan started.
   Gillette said he believes people are leaving the company for
other opportunities and because the buyout, offering as much as six
months' pay, was so attractive.
   Exxon has cut the number of tankers it operates, from 20 to 13,
because it curtailed shipments on the route from Alaska to the Gulf
Coast, officials said.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons of oil
into Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24 in the worst oil
spill in the country's history.

<TEXT>
   CBS, in search of a programs chief to lead it
out of the ratings wilderness, has reached agreement with Tri-Star
Pictures president Jeff Sagansky, sources close to the negotiations
say.
   CBS officials declined to comment Friday, and a Sagansky
spokesman would say only, ``there is no announcement yet.'' But an
executive who asked to remain anonymous said there would be a joint
announcement Monday by Columbia Studios, which owns Tri-Star, and
CBS.
   Sagansky would be joining CBS at a time it is facing a third
season as No. 3 in prime-time ratings, and considering schedule
changes for the second half of this season.
   He would replace Kim LeMasters, who resigned two weeks ago as
CBS Entertainment president. LeMasters held the job two years.
Ironically, CBS executives had considered Sagansky before picking
LeMasters.
   CBS last week tried unsuccessfully to lure to its vacant job a
top TV production team, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner. Their company
makes NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ABC's ``Roseanne.''
   CBS' agreement with Sagansky, 37, was delayed by extended
negotiations between CBS and Columbia Studios for the release of
Sagansky from his Tri-Star contract, CBS officials have said.
   Sagansky, a former senior NBC programs executive, joined
Tri-Star in 1985, and has been head of Tri-Star Pictures since
March.
   Credited with helping develop such films as ``Steel Magnolias,''
``Tap,'' and the just-released ``Glory,'' he would be responsible
for CBS' entire program schedule.
   He would face large task of restoration in coming months at
once-dominant CBS, which last month suffered the worst ratings it
ever has had in November.
   Although its daytime schedule emerged first in the November
ratings ``sweeps,'' CBS' prime time programs, its late-night ``The
Pat Sajak Show'' and ``CBS This Morning'' all were third in network
ratings.
   Although some CBS programs like ``Murphy Brown'' and the
recently returned ``Beauty and the Beast'' have won critical
praise, CBS hasn't had a hit series since the debut of ``Murder,
She Wrote'' in 1984.

   Art Buchwald's attorney said Paramount
Pictures stole a story proposal by the humorist and turned it into
a hit Eddie Murphy movie that grossed $150 million, without making
Buchwald a dime.
   In opening statements Friday at the trial of Buchwald's lawsuit,
Paramount's attorney denied the allegations and accused Buchwald's
lawyer of ``leading Mr. Buchwald and other creative people down a
primrose path to destroy this industry.''
   Attorney Pierce O'Donnell, who represents the columnist, said
Buchwald was victimized by the making of ``Coming to America'' and
deserves substantial punitive damages. He is asking for $5 million.
   O'Donnell told Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider he would
prove that Paramount took Buchwald's 1983 script idea entitled
``King For A Day'' and transformed it into the 1988 comedy, which
grossed more than $150 million.
   Murphy, the attorney said, has already netted $22 million from
the film and Paramount collected more than $50 million in
distribution fees. But the studio refused to pay Buchwald and
producer Alain Bernheim $250,000 plus a small share of profits
under their original contract.
   An attorney for Paramount, Robert Draper, ridiculed the idea
that Buchwald's script idea was plagiarized.
   He said it was so different that it never occurred to Ned Tanen,
then head of the studio, that there was any similarity between the
two ideas, both of which dealt with an African prince coming to the
United States.
   Draper said Murphy _ who is not a party in the suit _ has
admitted that he saw Buchwald's proposal. But Murphy said he
couldn't tell whether it influenced him subconsciously in writing
his own script for ``Coming to America.''

<HEAD>Walesa Backs Tough Reform Plan Before Parliament Meets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has endorsed
a tough economic reform package that the government acknowledges
will cause unemployment and cut incomes.
   The Solidarity trade union chairman's approval came two days
before Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and his Cabinet submit the
plan Sunday to parliament.
   Walesa received a three-member government delegation at his
Gdansk office on Friday, and said later he ``supported the
presented proposals,'' according to a statement released by an aide.
   The statement said Walesa also expressed the need for
``immediate and radical changes in ownership relations,'' a
reference to the more than 90 percent of Poland's non-farm economy
controlled by the state.
   Aleksander Hall, a Cabinet minister in charge of contacts with
political parties, and top officials of the Finance and Labor
ministries journeyed to Gdansk to present the government's
socio-economic program to Walesa.
   Walesa, who put together the parliamentary coalition that
allowed Solidarity to take contol of the government from the
communists in August, rejected any office for himself but retains
close supervision of the government and its programs.
   On Tuesday, Walesa caused a sensation in Poland when he said the
need for reform was so urgent that lawmakers should not review the
package at all, but simply give Mazowiecki and his government
special powers to carry out whatever reforms are necessary.
   A poll in the Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza on Friday
said 50 percent of respondents favored Walesa's proposal while 16
percent were definitely against. The rest were uncertain.
   However the government responded that it wants Parliament to
approve the program because it will require such extensive public
sacrifices.
   The aims of the program are to restructure the Polish economy to
encourage private enterprise and competition, choke off rampant
inflation that reached an estimated 900 percent in 1989 and open
the economy to foreign trade.
   Mazowiecki's Cabinet met through the week to put finishing
touches on the program, which includes tax increases and sharp
spending cuts to bring the state budget into balance.
   Government subsidies to enterprises are being cut, credit is
being tightened and coal and energy prices are going up to reflect
world price levels. The changes are expected to squeeze inefficient
enterprises and force them into bankruptcies.
   Real incomes are expected to drop 20 percent, industrial
production by 5 percent and the gross national product by 2 to 3
percent.
   Many workers are expected to become unemployed at least
temporarily and the government is creating its first program of
jobless compensation and retraining. It also plans financial aid
for children and pensioners.
   A major aspect of the reform is making the Polish currency fully
convertible inside Poland against hard currencies.
   The package has been prepared in consultation with the
International Monetary Fund, which is poised to sign a letter of
intent next week on an economic adjustment agreement with Poland
including standby loans of $700 million.
   The loans are conditioned on Poland carrying out its reforms.
Once the IMF has certified the Polish program as meeting the IMF's
tough standards, the World Bank and Western governments are to
weigh in with other loans worth up to $3.5 billion.

   A woman who discovered she lacked the
cash to pay for $5 worth of gasoline left her baby as collateral
with a convenience store clerk and returned with the money an hour
later.
   ``We did everything we could, but this is a store, not a
day-care center,'' said Helen Linnell, manager of Brooks Superette.
``We hope it doesn't happen again.''
   The woman apparently discovered she had no checks after pumping
the gas on Dec. 5. When the cashier asked for collateral, she
fetched the 5-month-old girl from her car, placed the baby on the
counter and left.
   ``The baby began to cry. My cashier didn't have a lot of
experience with babies,'' Linnell said. The cashier tried to feed
the baby from a bottle left in the seat, then took a pacifier from
the store's shelf. Neither worked, she said.
   The mother returned with a $5 check and left with the baby.
Workers at the store contacted the police, who notified
authorities. No charges were filed.

   Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha was a pig farmer
and bartender before he found a trade that made him one of the
richest and most dangerous men in the world.
   The cocaine baron, the son of peasants, had an estimated $1
billion in drug profits stashed away at the time of his death Frday
in a gunfight with police.
   Rodriguez Gacha, 42, was one of the leaders of the Medellin
cartel, which along with the Cali cartel is responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   Rodriguez Gacha had a grade school education and went from pig
farming to bartending. In the 1970s he became a hired killer for a
Colombian gangster trying to gain control of emerald mines.
   He became feared throughout the tropical areas of central
Colombia, killing emerald buyers and stealing their jewels.
   He also became wealthy and surrounded himself with bodyguards
and beautiful women.
   About 10 years ago, he became aware of the immense appetite for
drugs in the United States and began using his emerald-war profits
to buy cocaine base from Bolivia to be processed into pure cocaine.
   By 1984, he had so much money he was giving some away.
   When the southern city of Popayan was devastated by a 1984
earthquake, Rodriguez Gacha was seen walking through the ruined
city giving money to stunned survivors.
   He and other major drug traffickers banded together to form the
Medellin cartel, named after the northwestern city of Medellin
where smugglers traditionally had their headquarters.
   Rodriguez Gacha had many ranches, but perhaps his favorite was
at Pacho, 50 miles north of Bogota.
   After the government declared war against the drug dealers in
August when a presidential candidate was assassinated, the army
occupied the Pacho ranch. Many peasants in the area told an
Associated Press reporter at the time of the takeover that
Rodriguez Gacha was generous.
   They said he gave away thousands of dollars, providing money for
medical treatment and for seed and farm equipment when they could
not get loans from the government's farm bank.
   Police acknowledged that Rodriguez Gacha's popularity with
peasants had made it difficult to trap him.
   An American diplomat, speaking with the condition of anonymity,
told journalists three months ago that Rodriguez Gacha and other
traffickers had hundreds of people on their payrolls to help watch
for police raids.
   A vendor in a town square would be paid $50 a month to watch for
security forces heading toward Rodriguez Gacha's ranch, the
diplomat said, and a police colonel might be paid $15,000 a month
for information.
   But if Rodriguez Gacha was a saint to some Colombians, he was a
monster to others.
   Authorities said he was behind the Aug. 18 murder of Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan, one of the country's leading presidential candidates
who was shot down while addressing a campaign rally.
   He has been linked to hundreds of murders of prosecutors, judges
and politicians.
   Rodriguez Gacha also was responsibile for the killing in 1988 of
Jaime Pardo Leal, leader of the left-wing Patriotic Union Party,
authorities said. More than 700 members of the Patriotic Union have
been slain the past four years.
   Rodriguez Gacha was accused of paying right-wing death squads to
kill peasants suspected of supporting leftist guerrillas.
   Officials said Rodriguez Gacha was enraged by the guerrillas'
attempts to extort money from ranchers in areas where he owned
property and vowed to exterminate them and any of their
sympathizers.

   Temperatures of about 30 degrees below normal, biting winds and
snow continued to grip the nation's East and Midest today from New
England to Virginia and from Wisconsin into Kentucky.
   The National Weather Service forecast called for wind chill
indexes as cold as 10 degrees below zero in northern Arkansas and
northwest Texas. Wind chills of 20 below were predicted in parts of
Tennessee. Lower Michigan and North Carolina's mountains braced for
wind chills as cold as 30 below and parts of Indiana and Iowa
expected winds that made it feel like 40 below.
   Friday's cold blast dumped snow on much of the Midwest and East,
and from the Rocky Mountain states to northern New Mexico.
   Snowfall predictions call for 8 to 10 inches in higher
elevations and 14 inches or more in the Great Lakes snowbelts.
   An arctic cold front _ the leading edge of the cold-air blast _
swept the mid-Atlantic states with snow and rain. New snow
accumulations of between 1 and 3 inches fell north and west of the
nation's capital.
   The pressure difference between an intensifying low along New
England's coast and the arctic high over the nation's midsection
spawned the frigid winds. The high should sweep east and was
expected to bring clear to partly cloudy skies with some flurries
to the mid-Atlantic states today and Sunday morning.
   The mercury readings Friday were below freezing as far south as
northern Alabama and Mississippi, Arkansas, northwest Texas and
northeast New Mexico.
   Temperatures did not rise above zero in parts of Minnesota,
northwest Iowa, northern Nebraska, much of South Dakota, western
North Dakota and eastern Montana.
   Warnings for snow and cold temperatures this morning were posted
for much of New England and New York state, northern New Jersey,
western Pennsylvania, eastern and north-central Ohio, northern West
Virginia, Maryland's panhandle, northeast Lower Michigan and
north-central Wisconsin.
   A winter storm watch was posted today in Wyoming's northern
mountains.
   Snowfall during the 6 hours ending at 7 p.m. EST included 3
inches in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Alpena, Mich., and Binghamton, N.Y.
   Friday's high temperature for the nation was 80 degrees at
Kingsville, Texas.

<TEXT>
   State environmental officials are questioning
a decision to lay off workers cleaning up radioactive pollution at
the government's Fernald uranium plant after three supervisors
received contaminated this week.
   The accident happened as the supervisors were taking samples
from concrete silos holding radioactive waste at the plant, 18
miles northwest of Cincinnati. The U.S. Department of Energy, which
owns the plant, said Thursday the supervisors were exposed to
radioactive radon gas.
   Some officials said the plant's operators should have left such
work to employees trained to handle the materials. One hundred
trained workers were laid off at the plant Friday.
   ``We don't want to interfere in the labor agreements between the
company and the union, but we need the information (on the
contamination), and we're concerned that the layoffs are affecting
the speed at which we can do our work,'' said Graham Mitchell,
Fernald team leader for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   The contamination occurred during the latest unsuccessful
attempt to sample the contents of the silos. The silos emit radon
and are suspected of leaking waste into groundwater. Mitchell said
cleanup plans are impossible until contents of the silos are
analyzed.
   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, the contractor operating the
plant, suspended production this summer to concentrate on cleaning
up radioactive pollution.
   Ten union workers who had trained extensively for the sampling
task were among those laid off, said Mel Karnes, an official of
Atomic Trades &amp; Labor Council, an umbrella group for the 14 unions
at Fernald.
   ``So we've got three salaried individuals out there at 6 p.m. in
the dark and cold, trying to do it when they've had no hands-on
training,'' Karnes said.
   The Fernald plant had processed uranium since 1952 for use in
nuclear reactors and weapons. Some of the wastes at the plant date
from the Manhattan Project, which produced the first atomic bomb
during World War II.
   ``We're very concerned that the trained cleanup people were laid
off. We think it's inappropriate,'' said Catherine McCord, a
Fernald expert with the EPA in Chicago.
   Department of Energy teams from Fernald and one from the
department's Oak Ridge, Tenn., laboratories on Friday began
investigating Westinghouse's 18-hour delay in reporting the
contamination incident.
   ``They're supposed to notify the emergency operations center in
eight hours, but in reality they should get to us sooner,'' DOE
spokesman Steve Wyatt said. ``It just didn't make very good sense.''

<TEXT>
   In an effort to placate the
opposition, government leaders today agreed to force former
President Chun Doo-hwan to testify about corruption during his
authoritarian rule.
   The rare bipartisan agreement also barred two Chun aides from
politics, indicated a release of political prisoners and included a
proposal ``to restore honor'' and compensate victims of a 1980
military crackdown of anti-government protests.
   The brutal suppression of the riots in the southern city of
Kwangju remain an open wound nearly a decade after it happened.
   ``The results are not 100 percent satisfactory but I did my best
to put an end to the dispute,'' said opposition leader Kim
Dae-jung, who endorsed the compromise after seven hours of talks
with President Roh Tae-woo and two other opposition leaders.
   No reason was given for the settlement, which came as a surprise
to South Koreans, who are generally unaccustomed to political
compromise.
   ``I am glad that I have been able to reach satisfactory
agreement on the clearing away of the past issues,'' Roh told
reporters after the talks.
   Roh, also a former aide to Chun, had been dogged by the scandals
from the previous administration, and the United States had
expressed concern over increasing political unrest.
   Roh is also under pressure because of a slowing of exports and
the domestic market, and newspapers today said he was expected to
make major Cabinet and party leadership changes.
   Under the agreement, Chun must go before national television to
answer questions by lawmakers about corruption involving him, his
family and associates. So far 47 people, including a dozen members
of Chun's family, have been convicted of corruption and power abuse.
   The disgraced former leader surrendered $24 million in unused
political funds before issuing a formal apology and going into
rural seclusion last year.
   The agreement bars two former army generals closely associated
with him, Lee Hui-sung and Chung Ho-yong, from politics and
attempts to resolve a festering controversy about the riots in the
southern city of Kwangju.
   Chun, Chung and Lee have been accused of using the 1980 uprising
to seize power following the assassination of President Park
Chung-hee in 1979.
   According to official count, about 200 people were killed and
more than 1,500 were injured when the military crushed the
anti-government demonstrations.
   Officials said that under the agreement, the government will
accelerate actions to ``restore honor'' for citizens of Kwangju,
who were labled as rebels by the Chun administration.
   They said a bill will be introduced in the National Assembly to
pay up to $500,000 in compensation to families of each person
killed in the crackdown.
   The agreement also proposes the release of prisoners who are
serving long terms for political crimes. Justice Ministry officials
said about 200 people are in prison after being convicted of spying
for or helping Communist North Korea.
   Chun bowed to massive anti-government demonstrations and agreed
to step down following 1987 elections. Roh, another Chun associate,
was elected to succeed Chun and took office in February 1988.
   The opposition leaders said they would not raise other issues
related to the Chun adminsitration once all details set by the
agreement have been implemented.
   No deadline was officially set for implementation of the pact,
but presidential spokesman Lee Su-jung said, ``All problems should
be settled before the end of this year.''
   Government officials said the ``grand compromise'' was possible
on the 11-point agreement after Roh accepted the key opposition
demands for Chun's public testimony and action against Lee and
Chung.
   Chung is a legislator from Roh's governing Democratic Justice
Party and Lee is an executive of a state-run firm.

   Investigators looking for a boy who was

   More than 400 people called a special task force on the

   Gigler said most of calls were from the St. Joseph area, where
11-year-old Jacob lived. Some tipsters provided names, telephone
numbers and addresses of people they said closely resembled the man
in the sketch.
   The sketch was released Thursday during a news conference in
which investigators said they believed the man who kidnapped Jacob
was also responsible for the January abduction and sexual assault
on a boy in Cold Spring.

   A Colombian who was extradited to face
drug-importation charges was ordered held without bail after a
prosecutor argued he was likely to flee the country if freed.
   Nelson Cuevas Ramirez, 55, pleaded innocent Friday in U.S.
District Court to two counts of conspiracy and an importation
charge connected with the shipment of 240 pounds of cocaine to this
country.
   He is the 10th person to be extradited from Colombia since
August, when that country began a new drive against drug
trafficking,
   Ramirez, who arrived in New York early Friday from Bogota,
entered his plea before U.S. Magistrate Naomi Buchwald.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Glazer argued that Ramirez was
likely to leave the jurisdiction if freed on bail. His
court-appointed lawyer, Ruth Chamberlin, didn't contest the
government's position.
   Negotiations for the cocaine allegedly occurred in Panama, and
the 111 kilograms were seized in April 1987 at the Westchester
County Airport in New York, the indictment said.
   According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, as many as 300
Colombians have been charged in various U.S. cities on drug-related
charges, although many of the indictments are sealed.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party, fighting for its
survival, today said it fired party boss Erich Honecker to prevent
civil war and to correct errors that had plunged the country into
social and economic chaos.
   The latest ringing denunciation of the old regime was read at
the beginning of an emergency congress of the party, which is
considering radical moves in hopes it will retain some of its power
in East Germany's competitive elections in May.
   The congress later released a letter by Honecker in which he
said he had ``deceived'' himself about the state of the economy and
the mood of the people.
   ``I take full responsibility for the situation that has
arisen,'' the ailing, 77-year-old former party chief told party
officials in the letter, written nearly a month ago. He denied that
he was guilty of corruption or misuse of office.
   Most of the 2,750 delegates burst into applause as Honecker, now
under house arrest, was castigated for failing to heed Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's calls for reform. He was blamed for committing errors
that plunged the country into economic and social crises.
   The party report said Honecker had to be ousted Oct. 18 to
prevent ``a civil war-like bloody conflict'' with those pressing
for democratic change. It also urged members to analyze past
failings and criticized the party for failing to stand up to the
corrupt party hierarchy.
   It said, however, that the party should bear ``no collective
guilt'' for the wrongs committed by the disgraced former leaders.
   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans took to the streets and
tens of thousands fled the country in revulsion of Honecker's
hard-line rule in recent months. Despite democratic reforms that
have included the opening of the Berlin Wall, protests have
continued as investigators have disclosed massive corruption and
high living among the country's former leaders.
   The party has been stripped of its constitutional mandate to
rule, and more than 700,000 members have quit in recent weeks,
dropping party membership to about 1.6 million.
   Also today, the Christian Democrats, one of the small political
parties formerly aligned with the Communists, held its own congress
and elected reformer Lothar de Maiziere to head its new drive for
political autonomy.
   
   The weekend emergency meeting follows two days in which two
mainstays of Communist rule, the party's militia and the hated
secret police, were ordered dismantled by the government.
   In discussing the report on the origins of the crisis, delegate
Michael Schumann said Honecker's desire for ``self-promotion''
outdistanced the political line he set for the party to follow.
   Exposing and punishing those who misused their offices have
become major themes of Communist reformers trying to win public
trust and support at the polls.
   In appeals for order and reason, authorities have disclosed
incidents of violence against secret police agents and Communist
Party members, and contended that unrest is mounting at an
``alarming rate.''
   But East Berlin and other major cities visited in recent days by
foreign journalists appeared calm, and Western diplomats with
contacts nationwide suggest the official reports may be overstated.
   Under the new party platform, the Communists are seeking to
redefine themselves as social democrats. They may also vote today
to change the name of the party to reflect its new direction.
   In last week's party congress, Gregor Gysi, a 41-year-old
lawyer, was chosen the party's third leader in less than two months.
   Numerous grass-roots reform movements have sprung up this fall,
and many of them intend to run candidates in the elections that
will be the first to present the Communists with any genuine
competition in more than 40 years.

   A strong earthquake today rocked the
southern Philippines, crumbling parts of buildings and killing a
7-year-old boy.
   Coastal residents fled their homes in fear of tidal waves and
aftershocks, radio stations said.
   The quake measured 7.3 on the Richter scale and was felt
throughout eastern Mindanao, the second largest Philippine island,
and as far north as Legaspi City, 400 miles away, said Raymundo
Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology
and Seismology.
   Punongbayan said the institute's observatory station in Bislig,
570 miles southeast of Manila, reported cracks on the walls and
slight damage to instruments. He said a concrete wall of a nearby
building collapsed, crushing the 7-year-old boy.
   Red Cross and government officials had no other reports of
damage or casualties in the remote area, which has poor
communication links with the capital, Manila.
   In Golden, Colo., the U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was
centered in the Pacific about 40 miles off northeast Mindanao and
160 miles from Davao. The city is 560 miles southeast of Manila.
   At least eight houses near the area also reported minor damages.
There were reports of widespread power outages in Mindanao,
Punongbayan added.
   The government's Philippine Information Agency said an abandoned
one-story building in Davao collapsed, injuring a passer-by.
   ``We are fortunate that the earthquake struck a sparsely
populated area,'' Punongbayan said. ``It could have caused serious
damage if it had hit a city.''
   Manila radio station DZXL said residents, fearful of tidal
waves, fled their homes for higher ground when the tremor was felt.
   Lino Abraham, a researcher for the seismological institute
office in Bislig, told DZXL that several aftershocks measuring
about 3 on the Richter scale were also felt. He said the quake
triggered landslides and the Pacific swelled after the quake, but
there were no reports of tidal waves.
   It was the biggest earthquake in that area since a quake
registering 6.8 hit Nov. 7, 1976, causing minor damage.
   In August 1976, a quake measuring 7.9 struck near the
southwestern coast of Mindanao caused a tidal wave that killed
about 8,000 people. A magnitude 7.1 earthquake in western Mindanao
the next day caused some injuries and damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
and each increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times
greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in a populated
area while one of magnitude 7 is capable of causing widespread
heavy damage.
   The quake that struck the San Francisco area in October was 7.1.

   A Chinese couple hijacked a China Air jumbo jet
carrying 223 people today, and the plane was forced to touch down
in Japan with only 40 minutes of fuel left after South Korea
refused to let it land, officials said.
   The aircraft landed in the western city of Fukuoka almost four
hours after taking off from Beijing and the passengers were freed
unharmed, Japanese officials said. The couple, armed with only a
knife and accompanied by a child, were seized by police and were
being questioned.
   The Boeing 747 was flying from Beijing and was bound for the
United States when it was taken on its harrowing journey.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. identified the man as the
35-year-old manager of a Beijing cotton factory in China's Hebei
province, who said he was fleeing China with his wife and
10-year-old child.
   The network said the man wanted to flee because of the June
crackdown by the army on the pro-democracy movement, in which the
man said he participated.
   He was seriously injured when he was apparently pushed from the
plane after it landed, the network said, and the woman he
identified as his wife was overpowered by crew members.
   Flight 981 was traveling from Beijing to New York with stops
scheduled in Shanghai and San Francisco. It was commandeered by a
knife-wielding man before landing in Shanghai, an unidentified
Japanese Transport Ministry official said on television.
   The aircraft headed into South Korean airspace over the
southernmost island of Cheju. It sought permission to land in Seoul
but was refused, according to a South Korean Defense Ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   South Korea and Communist China have no diplomatic relations,
and there are no commercial flights between the nations.
   Japan Broadcasting reported that the hijackers had initially
sought to land in Taiwan, seat of the Nationalist Chinese
government, but were denied permission there as well. Officials at
Taipei Aerial Control Center said they did not receive any such
request for landing in Taiwan.
   When the jet moved into South Korea airspace, South Korean and
Japanese jet fighters intercepted the plane, according to officials
from the two countries.
   The South Korean jets blocked the Chinese airliner's path and
forced it to leave Korean airspace, according to military officials
in Seoul, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Later, the South Korean Defense Ministry issued a statement
saying, ``The central air control office notified that it could not
permit it to land unless safety of the aircraft and its passengers
were in danger.
   ``After the notification, the airplane diverted and flew toward
Fukuoka,'' the statement said without elaborating.
   Four Japanese military jets escorted the jumbo jet to Fukuoka,
Defense Agency spokesman Hironobu Mizoguchi.
   The aircraft landed at Fukuoka, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo on
Japan's westernmost main island of Kyushu, at 2:52 p.m. (12:52
a.m.) after the pilot said he only had 40 minutes of fuel left, the
Transport Ministry official said. The male hijacker, identified by
police as Zhang Zhenhai, 35, manager of a cotton factory in China's
Hebei province, threatened to blow up the plane unless the pilot
flew to Taiwan, Japan Broadcasting said, but no bomb was found.
   After the plane landed, a rear door opened and Zhang was shoved
out and fell to the tarmac, where he was seriously injured,
Japanese officials said. He was hospitalized.
   A woman partner, who Zhang said was his wife, was then
overpowered by crew members along with a 10-year-old boy, Japanese
news reports said.
   Several Chinese airliners have been hijacked in recent years,
with the hijackers demanding to go to South Korea or Taiwan.
   A Chinese diplomat in Tokyo asked the Japanese government to
return the plane and its passengers to China as soon as possible,
said Foreign Ministry China Division chief Koreshige Anami.
   The diplomat also requested that Japan hand over the hijackers,
Anami told reporters.
   In Beijing, an official with the Civil Aviation Administration
of China said the the plane would return to Beijing and that the
flight would set out again for New York on Sunday.
   A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said there were 223 people
on the plane when it was hijacked.

   Vietnam opposes the forced repatriation
of boat people who sought refuge in Hong Kong and reserves the
right to send them back to the British colony, according to an
official news report.
   The Vietnam News Agency said on Friday that a Foreign Ministry
official delivered a note on Vietnam's position regarding the boat
people to Emrys Davies, Britain's ambassador in Hanoi.
   A Foreign Office spokesman in London said today taht Britain
would not comment because it had not received confirmation of what
the note said.
   A group of 51 Vietnamese was flown from Hong Kong to Hanoi on
Tuesday in the first forced repatriation of boat people.
   Vietnamese authorities accepted the group and said the refugees
would not be mistreated, but officials also criticized the forced
repatriation program.
   According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Foreign Ministry note
strongly rejected forced repatriation and said Vietnam would only
accept ``those who volunteer to return or who are not opposed to
the repatriation.''
   It said the ministry official cautioned Davies that ``any
violation of these principles may hamper and even completely
disrupt the process of cooperation to resolve this problem step by
step'' as agreed to at a conference on Indochinese refugees held in
Geneva in June.
   According to the news agency, the ministry official said that
``if Vietnam discovers any case of `forced repatriation,' it
reserves the right to return them to Hong Kong.''
   Many of the 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into Hong Kong
since June 1988 are considered illegal ``economic migrants'' unless
they can prove they fled their Communist homeland to escape
persecution. Thousands have demonstrated to protest the decision by
Britain and its colony to force the return of the refugees, a
decision condemned by the United States.

   Silvana Mangano, the Italian actress whose
role as a sensual country girl in ``Bitter Rice'' made her a star,
died today in a Madrid hospital after several days in a coma, a
hospital spokeswoman said. She was 59.
   Ms. Mangano went into the coma after she suffered a heart attack
during surgery for cancer, said the Luz Clinic spokeswoman on
condition of anonymity. The actress had been suffering from cancer
for several years.
   Film director Pier Paolo Pasolini once called her a ``bitter
beauty'' who ``shined like a pearl'' but was always distant. In
later years, her career was overshadowed by that of her husband of
34 years, movie producer Dino De Laurentiis.
   She was born in Rome on April 21, 1930, the daughter of a
Sicilian railroad worker and an English mother.
   The trained dancer, model and former Miss Rome played only bit
parts until she landed the starring role in director Giuseppe De
Santis' 1949 film ``Bitter Rice,'' considered one of best examples
of the postwar Italian neo-realism movement.
   Filmgoers worldwide turned out to see the voluptuous actress
cavorting in the fields of the Po Valley, wearing a tight sweater,
shorts and thigh-high black stockings.
   She then starred in movies for such directors as Vittorio De
Sica, Pasolini, Mario Monicelli and Luchino Visconti.
   Although Ms. Mangano's fame was overshadowed by two other
haunting beauties of the Italian screen, Sophia Loren and Gina
Lollobrigida, she beat out the latter in auditions for ``Bitter
Rice.''
   While she achieved stardom, Ms. Mangano never seemed comfortable
in the role or even in making movies.
   ``I agreed to appear in `Bitter Rice' more because I needed
money than out of the desire to have a film career,'' she once told
an interviewer.
   The actress once said: ``I never liked myself, neither when I
was a roundish girl nor when I became a slender woman.''
   After a long absence from the screen, she had a small role in
the 1984 film ``Dune'' and appeared in the 1986 film ``Dark Eyes''
alongside Marcello Mastroianni, whom she described as her first
love.
   ``We used to live in the same part of Rome when we were kids. We
were in love, I was 16 and he was 22.''
   As to her infrequent movie roles, she explained at the time:
``The truth is that making films is not my passion, and I thought
it was better for me not to work.''
   She separated from De Laurentiis in 1983 and filed for divorce
last year. The couple had three daughters and a son, who died in an
air crash in Alaska in 1981.
   She spent the last few years living in in Madrid with Francesca,
her youngest daughter, who is married to a Spanish film producer.
   The hospital spokeswoman gave no information regarding funeral
or memorial services.
   The Spanish national news agency EFE quoted sources close to the
family as saying Ms. Mangano's body would be cremated Sunday and
the remains sent to an unidentified New York cemetery to be placed
next to those of her son.

<HEAD>Patriarchs Restrict Christmas Celebrations; Collaborator Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian patriarchs of Jerusalem and the Holy
Land have decided to cancel festive Christmas visits and limit
other celebrations in sympathy with Palestinians who lost relatives
in the uprising.
   The Roman Catholic Patriarchate made the announcement as
violence continued in the occupied lands. One Arab was slain by
fellow Palestinians on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and five
Israeli-owned cars were set ablaze.
   Police said the 46-year-old Palestinian whose body was found in
Jabel Mukaber village was apparently suspected of collaborating
with Israel. His name was not released.
   It was the first killing of a suspected collaborator in the
Israeli-annexed part of the city, and it brought to 159 the number
of such kilings during the two-year uprising. In addition, 631
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire and 43 Israelis
have died.
   In Jewish west Jerusalem, arsonists believed to be Palestinians
set fire to five Israeli-owned vehicles overnight, police said. In
the last few months, more than 120 cars have been burned in the
area, and police believe Arab assailants have been responsible in
most cases.
   The Jerusalem office of the Roman Catholic patriarch, Michel
Sabbah, said Sabbah met with the Greek Orthodox patriarch of
Jerusalem, Diodoros I, and other religious officials to discuss the
``deteriorating situation'' in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Sabbah is the first Arab to head the Catholic Church in
Jerusalem.
   The patriarchs decided to issue a Christmas message voicing the
need for justice and peaceful settlement of the conflict; to
restrict Christmas celebrations to liturgical services and prayers
for justice and peace; and to cancel all Christmas visits and other
festivities ``in sympathy with those who mourn their beloved
ones,'' a statement said.
   The decision followed Thursday's announcement in Bethlehem and
neighboring Beit Sahour that Christmas celebrations would be
canceled for the third year in a row to support the uprising.
   In Gaza City and several towns in the West Bank, Palestinians
staged a five-minute traffic stoppage today following a call from
the uprising's underground leadership to commemorate ``martyrs'' of
the conflict, Arab and Israeli reports said.
   Arab journalists said Israeli troops tried to order the vehicles
to drive on and were met with a barrage of stones and shouts of
``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great.
   Soldiers fired into the air and threw grenades, finally
resorting to live ammunition and plastic bullets, witnesses said.
In Gaza's hospitals, officials reported they treated five wounded
Arabs. The army said it had no information about the injuries.
   Soldiers also blocked entrances to the largest West Bank city,
Nablus, to prevent a group of Israelis from the leftist Peace Now
movement from meeting with Palestinians. The army said the Israelis
were kept out because Nablus was declared a closed military zone
and only residents could enter.

<HEAD>Communists Confirm Purge in Czechoslovak Central Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper
today confirmed that eight former leaders had either resigned or
been removed from the party's policy-setting Central Committee.
   The purge appeared to be an effort to rid the party of longtime
officials who have been discredited by the pro-democracy movement,
which has forced the Communists to give up their monopoly on power.
   The official CTK news agency had reported Thursday that
``several members'' of the Central Committee resigned.
   The party daily Rude Pravo identified them today as former
President Gustav Husak, Parliament speaker Alois Indra, chief
ideologist Jan Fojtik and Ignac Janak, Slovak Communist party boss
and Politburo member.
   It said the following members were removed from the 140-plus
body: Vasil Bilak, Karel Hoffmann, Josef Lenart and Miroslav
Zavadil, all top-level officials and veteran hard-liners. They were
removed by decision of the party's ruling Politburo, the newspaper
said.
   Josef Hora, a Central Committee spokesman, told The Associated
Press on Thursday that Frantisek Hanus, a member of the Committee's
secretariat, also had resigned.
   Hora said the Politburo accepted all of the resignations on
Wednesday.
   As part of the democratic reforms sweeping Eastern Europe,
Czechoslavakia's first government dominated by non-Communists in 41
years took over Sunday.
   There now appears to be a deepening split between hard-line and
reform-minded party members that could lead to the establishment of
a new democratic party. Some Communists have been pressing the
party to adopt reforms to be able to compete with the opposition.
   Party member Vasil Mohorita, elevated to the Politburo on Nov.
24, appears to be among the reformers, as do a loose association of
Communists who have formed the Communist Democratic Forum.
   The group's spokesman, Rudolf Prevratil, told CTK on Friday that
only the party congress, to be held Wednesday and Thursday, will
tell ``whether this movement can live inside the Communist Party.''

   Police who tracked down and killed a
powerful leader of the Medellin drug cartel called the slaying a
``splendid Christmas present,'' but warned that drug terrorism
could rise as a result.
   Hours after Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, his 17-year-old son Fredy
and five bodyguards were killed in a hail of gunfire Friday,
authorities pledged to hunt down Pablo Escobar, Colombia's cocaine
godfather and its most-wanted criminal.
   President Bush called President Virgilio Barco to congratulate
him and the country's security forces for eliminating Rodriguez
Gacha, who has been implicated in hundreds of murders of
politicians, judges and peasants.
   Colombia's Medellin and Cali drug cartels are believed
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches the streets
of the United States.
   The operation was by far the biggest success of Barco's
16-week-old war on drug traffickers. Authorities said Gacha
Rodriguez in fact had ordered the Aug. 18 assassination of a
leading presidential candidate, the slaying that led to the
government's crackdown on traffickers.
   A Bogota daily, La Prensa, today quoted a journalist who was
present at the raid as saying Rodriguez Gacha killed himself with a
hand grenade after he was cornered by police.
   The journalist was identified as Silvio Cohen, a correspondent
for Barranquilla's El Heraldo newspaper. La Prensa said Rodriguez
Gacha's body was ripped to pieces by the grenade explosion.
   However, an official coroner's report released today said bullet
wounds to the head and body had killed Rodriguez Gacha, apparently
confirming the official version of his death.
   Just hours after the drug lord's death, gunmen fatally shot a
police lieutenant in Medellin, the RCN radio network reported. RCN
said it was not known if the slaying was related to the drug war.
   Security forces tracked Rodriguez Gacha to a farm owned by
Escobar near the Caribbean port of Covenas, 360 miles north of
Bogota. Rodriguez Gacha and the others were wiped out in the fierce
battle that ensued, Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla, the national police
chief, told a news conference in Bogota.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that police laid
a trap for Rodriguez Gacha about 10 days ago. The newspaper,
quoting senior police officials, said Gacha's son, who had been
arrested earlier on a weapons charge, was freed so police could
follow him to Rodriguez Gacha.
   About 1,000 police and troops, supported by seven helicopter
gunships, participated in the operation, Colombia's leading
newspaper El Tiempo reported today, citing police officials as its
sources. Security forces began mobilizing for the raid late
Thursday, El Tiempo said.
   A judge had released the trafficker's son from jail on Nov. 23
after holding him for three months. Police arrested the youth on
Aug. 25 after raiding his hideout and discovering a weapons cache.
   El Tiempo quoted a police official as saying that authorities
acted on information provided by farmers in the area. Gen. Carlos
Arturo Casadiegos reportedly said the government would pay a
$581,000 reward to the farmers.
   None of the various versions of the events could be confirmed
with Bogota police today.
   Miguel Maza Marquez, head of Colombia's investgative police,
said the trafficker's death was ``a splendid Christmas present.''
   Rodriguez Gacha was linked to many of the killings that have
rocked Colombia and killed 199 people since Aug. 18.
   Maza accused Rodriguez Gacha of ordering the killing of
presidential candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a staunch opponent
of the nation's drug trade and the favorite to succeed Barco.
   Rodriguez Gacha also has been accused of the murders of Justice
Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla in 1984, of newspaper publisher
Guillermo Cano in 1986 and of the leader of the leftist Patriotic
Union Party, Jaime Pardo Leal, in 1988.
   Maza also blamed Rodriguez Gacha for a Dec. 8 car bomb attack
that killed 63 people outside the investigative police
headquarters. His cartel also was suspected in the Nov. 27 bombing
of a Avianca airlines jetliner near Bogota, which killed 107 people.
   Among the possible results of Rodriguez Gacha's death is an
increase in violence within the cartel itself to fill the power
vacumn.
   Maza said the next step was to hunt down Escobar. ``We just need
a little luck like we had today with Rodriguez Gacha,'' Maza said.
   A former pig farmer who became a billionaire cocaine trafficker,
Rodriguez Gacha owned vast stretches of land in Colombia.
   He was fighting wars against the government as well as a rival
cocaine cartel from the southern city of Cali. He was also battling
other gangsters for control of the country's emerald mines.
   ``This guy wants to be the Hitler of Colombia,'' a foreign
diplomat said recently.
   Rodriguez Gacha also financed and directed several right-wing
death squads. In recent years, the death squads have killed
hundreds of peasants suspected of supporting left-wing guerrillas.
   Officials have assumed that the drug lords are using a bombing
campaign to try to pressure the government into abandoning its
extradition policy, decreed by the president as part of the latest
crackdown.
   The government has sent 10 middle-level drug suspects to the
United States in less than four months.

   Rescuers saved all 85 people aboard a
wooden ship which sank in the Java Sea, with only six suffering
slight injuries, the search mission coordinator center said
Saturday.
   The 33-ton Batam Jaya, which also carried cement and iron bars,
left the port of Sunda Kelapa in northern Jakarta Thursday night
for Batam Island and sank after developing a leak off the Seribu
Islands early Friday.
   Rescuers deployed three helicopters and two planes in the search
effort and were joined by coast guard and private ships. The sunken
ship was discovered off Jaga Utara Island, about 80 miles northwest
of Jakarta.
   Rescue teams saved all 85 people aboard, including 17 crew
members, air force Col. A. Siregar said. Six suffered minor
injuries while trying to save themselves, he said.
   Earlier reports counted only 75 people, including 15 crew
members aboard the ship.

<TEXT>
   The government minister who has led Egypt's
crackdown on Moslem militants escaped injury today when a truck
bomb exploded just before he arrived at his sports club, security
officials said.
   A vehicle carrying the interior minister, Zaki Badr, was
approaching the club when the explosion occurred, and police on
motorcycles captured a man who ran from the pickup truck that
exploded, the officials said.
   The captured man was the only person injured in the blast.
   The state-owned Middle East News Agency said the truck exploded
while the vehicle carrying the minister was passing by. The report
also said the driver of the booby-trapped truck carried forged
identification.
   As interior minister, Badr has led an iron-fisted government
crackdown on Moslem militants since 1986. He is responsible for
Egypt's internal security.
   Militant Moslem fundamentalists attempted to kill two of his
predecessors in 1987. One suffered serious injuries, but the other
escaped unhurt.
   Badr, a 63-year-old Moslem, joined the Cabinet in 1986 after
police recruits, allegedly encouraged by religious extremists, went
on a two-day shooting rampage through wide areas of Cairo. He is
known for making outspoken attacks on Moslem radicals and local
Communists.
   Around the time of the blast, police announced today that nearly
500 Moslem fundamentalist militants were arrested in a security
operation throughout the southern province of Assiut. The arrests
came after a street fight and shootout on Monday between militants
and police in the province.
   Monday's clash occurred when police tried to stop a march by 300
anti-government, Moslem militants from a mosque to the city center.
   Security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in
keeping with ministry practice, said today's explosion occurred
shortly after 8 a.m. on a main street outside the Police Sporting
Club in Cairo's Abbassiya dictrict. Badr usually goes to the club
every morning for jogging and massage.
   They said the explosive-laden vehicle _ a stolen, orange-colored
pickup truck _ pulled up at the club minutes before Badr was to
arrive.
   ``The driver obviously had been watching the minister's
movements and knew about his daily trips to the club,'' one
official said. ``As the car exploded, he jumped out and ran despite
injuries to his right side.''
   Two policemen on motorcycle traveling ahead of Badr's limousine
saw the driver, gave chase and seized the suspect about 600 yards
from the explosion site, the officials said. The only detail they
would give about the driver is that he comes from Fayoum, in
southern Egypt.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While Europe tries to come to grips with the
idea of German reunification, the two states are broadening ties so
swiftly that reunification already seems under way.
   Washington and Moscow insist they have a say in the process, but
neither Bonn nor East Berlin is paying much attention to the
superpowers in the daily rush of changes.
   Not a day has passed in recent weeks without a visit or another
series of agreements, although East German Communists loudly insist
the contacts will stop short of a formal union.
   The cooperation ranges from large industrial projects to plans
for single subway tickets for West Berlin and East Berlin, and
completion of autobahn links broken off by World War II.
   For many countries, though, the memories of war and Holocaust
are still too fresh to make the prospect of a united Germany a
pleasing one.
   The country would have 80 million people in the heart of Europe
and an economic might that would dwarf its neighbors. Fears about
an emerging ``Fourth Reich'' have been voiced.
   ``Our neighbors are worried and their fears are justified,''
says noted West German political scientist Joachim Perels.
   Josef Janning, an expert on East-West relations at the
University of Mainz, says fears of what reunification would bring
are exaggerated, but agrees West Germany must consult with other
countries on its policy toward East Germany.
   ``Until recently, politicians made perfunctory statements about
unity but no one really took it seriously until a few months ago,''
he told The Associated Press.
   ``But now that the Germans are discovering their own national
policy, there are justifications for fears. Bonn should not make
any unilateral moves without consultations,'' he said.
   ``But some sort of German unity cannot be prevented, not even
the Germans can prevent it.''
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl angered some governments by proposing a
10-point plan for eventual reunification without consulting Bonn's
allies.
   European leaders have passed resolutions that hardly hide their
fears of a mighty German state dominating Europe. U.S. officials
have said American and Soviet interests and rights must be
considered and Secretary of State James A. Baker III has urged a
go-slow approach to German reunification.
   The Soviets, who have nearly 400,000 soldiers in East Germany,
have issued stern warnings against Western intereference in East
German developments and have clearly stated they are against
reunification.
   The leaders of the 12 European Economic Community countries have
agreed that reunification must come through self-determination of
the people in the two Germanys and in consultation with other
European countries.
   The European Parliament has urged West Germany to state
``quickly and unambiguously'' that the reunification would stop
short of its former eastern territories that were lost in the war
and now belong to Poland and the Soviet Union.
   Meanwhile, in East Germany, weekly demonstrations have
increasingly become more nationalistic.
   ``Germany United Fatherland,'' thousands of people have shouted
at mass rallies the past four Mondays in Leipzig, the hotbed of the
East German opposition movement. Calls for quick reunification have
been made at other rallies in the country.
   At the last Leipzig rally, angry exchanges broke out between
supporters and opponents of reunification, and the opposition
movement has said it fears a split in its ranks over the issue.
   Free elections in East Germany have been set for May 6, 1990,
and at least two opposition groups have spoken in favor of
reunification.
   East Germany's Communist-dominated government officially remains
opposed to reunification, but at the same time it has gone on to
broaden ties with Bonn at all levels.
   When holes began opening in the Berlin Wall, East Berlin and
West Berlin police quickly established contact to deal with traffic
problems and other matters.
   ``What belongs together will grow together,'' former West German
Chancellor Willy Brandt said after the opening of the Berlin Wall,
in a much quoted remark.
   Even before Kohl goes to East Germany this week, cooperation
between the two states has proceeded at a rapid pace.
   Volkswagen, West Germany's biggest auto maker, has signed an
agreement to cooperate in developing a new generation of East
German Trabant cars. Dresdner Bank, the second-largest bank in West
Germany, is considering opening branches in East Germany.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann visited East
Berlin last week and the two sides agreed to set up a joint
economic commission to expand cooperation.
   Bonn has promised $580 million for a project to clean up East
Germany's badly polluted environment.
   Lufthansa and Interflug, the two flag carriers, are adding new
flights between the two countries nearly every week.
   In a once-unthinkable move, Lufthansa joined with Interflug in
placing a full-page advertisement in Neues Deutschland, the
Communist Party newspaper.
   A fast rail link between Berlin and Hanover is under
consideration. A daily bus connection between Rostock in East
Germany and Kiel in West Germany started last week. From January 1,
West Germans will not need visas to visit East Germany.
   Perels, the political scientist, urges a slowdown in the current
breakneck speed.
   ``We have a special historical responsibility toward our
neighbors. We are not like any other country, we had the death
camps,'' Perels told The AP.
   ``For our democracy we have to thank the Allies. This is
something we often forget,'' Perels said, urging Germans to heed
concerns voiced by those in Washington, London and elsewhere.

   American foundations are launching a series of
initiatives to encourage the political, social and economic changes
sweeping through the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   Efforts by foundations and private philanthropists range from
assisting pig farmers in Poland to fighting the spread of AIDS in
the Soviet Union and arranging exchanges between U.S. Vietnam
veterans and Soviet veterans of the Afghanistan war.
   The recent initiatives were capped by last week's announcement
by the Ford Foundation that it was committing an additional $6
million for grants to individuals and organizations in the region _
focusing on legal and political reforms, economics and the
environment.
   Franklin A. Thomas, president of the major New York-based
foundation, said the changes offer it ``many important
opportunities to contribute to the development of democratic values
and pluralism in the region and to the integration of the Soviet
Union and East European countries into the international system.''
   Also last week, the Carnegie Corporation of New York hosted a
two-day conference of U.S. foundation officials, business
executives, government officials and academics to help map further
philanthropic initiatives.
   At least two American foundations dealing with the Soviet Union
are pursuing programs with Moscow-based affiliates that have gained
official status under Soviet law as independent philanthropic
organizations.
   One of them, the San Francisco-based Foundation for Social
Innovations USA, was formed last June to work together with a
foundation started two years earlier in the Soviet Union with
sponsorship by the Moscow newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, a
different publication from the often-quoted Pravda.
   The groups have launched programs including an exchange of
veterans of the Afghanistan and Vietnam wars, as well as a project
operated jointly with the Esalen Institute to help veterans and
disaster victims cope with post-traumatic stress problems.
   Henry S. Dakin, a San Francisco philanthropist who has been a
major contributor to the U.S.-Soviet effort, said the Foundation
for Social Innovations also has organized an Alaska-Siberia project
to help revive travel and people-to-people contacts over that
frontier.
   The New York-based Soros Foundation-Soviet Union was founded in
1987 by George Soros, a Hungarian emigre who became wealthy as a
money manager on Wall Street. It has supported the launching of a
Soviet counterpart, the Cultural Initiative, with headquarters at a
restored 17th-century mansion in central Moscow.
   Programs being undertaken by the Soros-funded organizations
include bringing young Soviet attorneys to this country for
internships at American law firms; assisting a
wheelchair-manufacturing project in Leningrad; and providing
American-made disposable hypodermic needles to Soviet hospitals.
   ``This was a response to a growing sense of urgency in the
Soviet Union about AIDS and ways of controlling it,'' said Anthony
Richter, a Soros Foundation program officer.
   Concern about acquired immune deficiency syndrome has been
heightened in the Soviet Union by recent incidents in which
children in Soviet hospitals were infected through the re-use of
unsterilized needles.
   In addition, Richter said the Soros Foundation has launched a
``very promising'' program to train Soviet medical professionals in
the use of American-developed methods for treating alcoholics.
   Soros also founded in 1984 a foundation dealing with his native
Hungary, where that organization has begun projects to help
independent organizations and small businesses get started and has
broadened its program supporting English-language instruction.
   Other American foundations currently funding programs in Eastern
Europe include the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the German Marshall
Fund of the United States and the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation.
   In Poland, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which has spent about
$4 million on Eastern Europe since 1983, assisted in the formation
of a new Warsaw-based Foundation for the Development of Polish
Agriculture.
   John Edie, general counsel of the Council on Foundations, a
Washington-based organization of 1,200 grant-making institutions,
said the Polish group has ``really been a stimulation to the hog
farmers. They chose that because Polish ham is a very popular
export.''
   Edie said American foundations were most interested in
encouraging wider development of an independent sector in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, because ``the more independent
thinking and initiative there is in those countries, the easier it
is going to be for them to continue the direction they're going
toward.''

   An arctic onslaught of snow and cold continued to refrigerate
much of the East and Midwest today, after heavy weather snarled
traffic and forced closure of schools, government offices and even
racetracks.
   Four traffic deaths and two related to snow and cold were blamed
on the weather Friday.
   ``An Arctic air mass out of Alaska and northern Canada has been
sitting over the middle United States and shows no inclination to
move,'' Weather Service forecaster Larry Hildebrand said in
Chicago. ``We're running about 30 degrees below normal for this
time of year.''
   Up to 8 inches of snow piled up by this morning from New England
south into Virginia and from Michigan and Wisconsin into Kentucky,
according to the National Weather Service. Boston had 3 inches, and
central Massachusetts got as much as 8 inches, as did east-central
Wisconsin.
   Wind and cold overnight made it feel as cold as 10 degrees below
zero in northern Arkansas and northwest Texas, and the wind-chill
was expected to dive to 20 below in parts of Tennessee.
   Overnight lows included 14 degrees below zero at Kansas City
International Airport and 3 below at Bluefield, W.Va. St. Louis'
reading of 8 below broke the record for the date. In Kansas, lows
of 16 below at Salina and 15 below at Topeka set records.
   Record temperatures measured in Texas today included 9 degrees
in Abilene, 11 at Waco, 12 at Midland and the Dallas-Fort Worth
airport, 17 at Austin and San Antonio, 19 at Houston, 24 at Corpus
Christi and 33 at Brownsville, the state's southernmost town on the
Mexican border.
   The cold blast on Friday dumped snow on much of the Midwest and
East, and from the Rocky Mountain states to northern New Mexico.
   Snow and ice made driving hazardous in many areas, forcing
authorities to close schools and offices.
   Government offices and courts closed in parts of Ohio and
Pennsylvania, horse or harness races were canceled in Ohio and
Pennsylvania. The Ku Klux Klan called off a rally planned for
Oxford, Ohio, saying it was because of cold.
   Students got the day off from school in parts of Wyoming,
Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio,
Kentucky and West Virginia.
   Authorities at the Wheeling-Ohio County Airport in West
Virginia's Northern Panhandle planned to dedicate $170,000 worth of
snow removal equipment Friday, but the ceremony was postponed
because the equipment was put to work.
   ``Priorities are such that we need to get our runways clean,''
said airport manager Thomas Tominack.
   Traffic snarled in many areas as big rigs jackknifed on icy
highways and cars skidded into fender-benders.
   Indiana authorities blamed two traffic deaths Friday on the
weather. In Glenwillow, Ohio, police blamed icy roads for a crash
that killed a woman. Wyoming officials said a man was killed Friday
afternoon when his automobile slid off of Interstate 80 and
overturned.
   The cold wave chased thousands of the nation's homeless into
crowded shelters. Two deaths in St. Louis were blamed on the snow
and cold.
   In Chicago, where temperatures didn't climb out of the single
digits Friday, all but 260 of the city's 3,400 beds in shelters and
churches were filled Friday.

   A team of experts from the United States,
Britain and South Korea joined Saturday in urging a drive to reduce
the numbers of Europe's 18 million unemployed.
   ``Europe's long-term unemployed represent its greatest untapped
resorde,'' they said.
   The group consists of economists Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger
Dornbusch and Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology; Mervyn King and Richard Layard of the London School of
Economics; Lawrence H. Summers of Harvard University; and Yung Chul
Park of Korea University in Seoul.
   Their report, ``World Imbalances,'' was sponsored by World
Institute for Development Economics Research, set up in Helsinki,
Finland, as part of the United Nations University.
   They suggested use of a Swedish model to fight unemployment:
intensive placement, conseling and retraining services for people
who lose their jobs; unemployment benefits that run out in 14
months; six months of public employment if no job has been found;
and a 50 percent wage subsidy lasting six months for employers who
hire people who have been out of work for six months.
   ``Unemployment in Sweden has never been over 3.5 percent and now
stands under 1.5 percent,'' the authors said.
   For the United States they recommended an emphasis on increased
savings. Low U.S. savings and the accompanying high federal budget
deficit create a worldwide shortage of capital, threaten the world
trading system and are a likely source of instability in the world
economy, they said.
   In addition to reducing the federal budget deficit, they
suggested:
   _ removing social security and its surpluses from the federal
budget, so that the apparent budget deficit is greater and public
pressure increases to lower it;
   _ restoring the Individual Retirement Account; and
   _ instituting tax incentives for savings, such as a deduction
for employees who as part of their wages will accept stock that
cannot be sold for five years, or a deduction for investment in
special Treasury notes that could not he'sold.
   They have a radical proposal for Third World debt, now close to
$1.3 trillion. They would allow interest payments to be made in the
currency of the debtor countries, rather than in hard currencies
like dollars or yen which are now required.
   They said the effect would be to:
   _ stop transfers of funds from debtor countries to creditors,
now running over $50 billion a year;
   _ reduce the uncertainty of exchange rates, thus encouraging the
return of billions of dollars sent abroad for safekeeping by people
in debtor countries; and
   _ free the foreign currency held by debtor countries for
purchases of goods in the creditor countries.
   In the Pacific they warned that a cut in the U.S. budget could
bring recession to East Asia. They recommended coordinating the
policies of the United States and East Asian countries on how
production should be distributed among them.
   To prevent the world trading system from breaking into regional

Economic Community, they urged:

   President Bush and French President
Francois Mi`tjrrand today began a Caribbean session expected to
focus on fast-paced changes in East-West relations.
   Bush and Mitterrand both arrived separately at Princess Juliana
Airport on the Dutch side of this small island and then flew
separately by helicopter to the French section of the island, to
begin their talks.
   Presidental Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
aboard Air Force One that the president was suffering ``mild
laryngitis and a cold'' that he said the president was treating
with aspirin, a decongestant and throat lozenges.
   Asked why the president had travelled such a long way for so
short a meeting with the French leader, Fitzwater told reporters:
   ``Both of them felt that they neeeded a face-to-face meeting to
discuss some of the more personal and private sides of the changes
going on in Eastern Europe and their personal impressions of
(Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev and what is happening in
the Soviet Union.''
   Fitzwater added that ``President Mitterrand asked for the
meeting and President Bush likes to meet with leaders in a
face-to-face situation. It just made sense.''
   Bush was to spend just over four hours on St. Martin before
returning to Washington in the evening.
   U.S. officials said Mitterrand requested the meeting, partly to
discuss developments in Eastern Europe and also to reciprocate for
the weekend he spent last spring at Bush's oceanside retreat in
Maine.
   Bush had laryngitis Friday night and canceled a trip to
Manhattan, where he was to speak at the 80th convention of the
NAACP.
   In a brief telephone call to the gathering Friday night, Bush
apologized for not being there and said, ``I will use my office to
speak out against racism and bigotry wherever it is found.''
   Today's meeting at a secluded beach resort comes two weeks after
Bush's storm-shortened summit with Gorbachev off the Mediterranean
island of Malta. Bush and Mitterrand can expect better weather on
St. Martin _ clear skies and temperatures in the 80s.
   A discussion of Gorbachev is expected to be high on the agenda.
Mitterrand met with the Soviet leader in Kiev three days after the
Bush-Gorbachev summit.
   ``Undoubtedly they'll have some mutual reflections on those
meetings,'' Fitzwater said.
   Mitterrand has also indicated he wants to brief Bush on last
weekend's meeting of leaders of the 12-nation European Community in
Strasbourg, France.
   ``Out of that will flow the larger issues of the changes going
on in Eastern Europe, the future of the NATO alliance, probably
German reunification, and all of those questions related to reforms
in the Soviet Union,'' Fitzwater said.
   European leaders at the meeting on the French-German border
endorsed the idea of a single Germany but suggested a series of
conditions to ensure that German reunification does not cause
instability in Europe.
   Mitterrand has stressed the need to take Soviet concerns into
account when discussing German reunification.
   Bush has voiced general support for ending the divisions in
Germany spawned by World War II, but says the United States should
not press for a certain timetable and the eventual decision must be
acceptable to both East and West Germans.
   The Strasbourg session also produced statements by European
leaders hailing recent changes in Eastern Europe and praising
Gorbachev's initiatives.
   St. Martin is a 37-square-mile island in the eastern Caribbean
shared by France and the Netherlands.
   Bush and Mitterrand were to meet for about three hours and have
lunch at the resort, then hold a joint news conference.
   One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity
said international terrorism also was expected to be discussed.
   French authorities are under a heightened state of alert for
what French Interior Minister Pierre Joxe has descRied as an acute
threat of terrorist attack during the holiday season.
   On Friday, the State Department expressed concern about the
possibility that Middle Eastern terrorists may be planning a
variety of attacks, perhaps against U.S. targets in Western Europe
or West Africa.
   Meanwhile, the administration suggested Friday that continued
Soviet adherence to ``a centralized planning course'' could
jeopardize some economic incentives Bush offered Gorbachev.
   Fitzwater, the presidential spokesman, cited recent criticism in
the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies of Gorbachev's perestroika
_ or restructuring _ and moves toward keeping multiyear planning
methods.

<HEAD>Mall Apologizes to Black Santa for Alleged Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANDOVER HILLS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shopping center is asking a black
Santa Claus to return, issuing a public apology to the man who quit
last week because he said the mall objected to his skin color.
   Derrick L. Trice walked off the job Tuesday as one of three
Santas at Capital Plaza Mall in Prince George's County, saying he
wouldn't return unless he received such an apology.
   The mall issued a public statement Friday, saying it ``in no way
intended to convey the message that Mr. Trice's services were not-
anted or that he was not welcome to return to his position as
Santa Claus. If Mr. Trice received this impression, the mall
regrets that and extends its apology to Mr. Trice.''
   Trice, 21, met with the county branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Friday.
Richard Steve Brown, president of the NAACP branch, told The
(Baltimore) Sun he planned to pursue the incident with the mall's
owners this week.
   Trice could not be reached for comment; his telephone number was
not in local directories.
   Mall manager Thomas A. Breece issued the apology but said he has
not spoken with Trice and did not know if he would return.
   Trice said he confronted the mall's managers after a mall
security guard came by his post to ask ``how long the black Santa
would be around.'' He said he was shown the door after an argument
with Breece.
   Officials at the mall said the incident came about after
customers _ both black and white _ complained about the black
Santa. Trice was asked to leave the mall office because he was very
upset, according to the statement.
   ``The Capital Plaza Mall continues to believe that it is
appropriate to have Santas of all races,'' the mall's statement
said. ``The mall sincerely hopes that Mr. Trice will return and
continue to serve its customers.''

<HEAD>Vice President: Trust Bush on China Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle is predicting that
within six months to a year, events in China will vindicate
President Bush for his much-criticized overtures to Beijing.
   ``In due time, critics will see this as the right decision at
the right time,'' Quayle said Friday when asked about the
widespread criticism of Bush for sending two top-level envoys to
Beijing last weekend.
   In so doing, the president opened the door to renewal of ties
with China little more than six months after the Chinese government
used tanks to quell pro-democracy demonstrations, killing hundreds,
possibly thousands of people.
   The vice president would not give details but hinted that U.S.
officials in the wake of the weekend visit know of some forthcoming
developments that will show an improved Chinese posture on human
rights and political freedoms.
   ``China took a step backwards with the Tiananmen Square
tragedy,'' Quayle said in the interview. ``China hopefully will
have the political reforms reinstituted and China will move
forward. My prediction is that the president's bold initiative
toward China will be fully appreciated within the long run by the
American people.''
   Bush quietly dispatched National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to
Beijing a week ago Friday, in a departure from the ban on
high-level contacts with China that he imposed after the Tiananmen
Square massacre.
   The visit was intended to begin discussions on normalizing
relations, but U.S. officials have said that will not happen and
the sanctions against China will not be lifted until China shows
improvement in political reform and human rights.
   Quayle insisted that Bush, a former envoy to China, ``knows what
he is doing'' and had made a ``strategic and tactical decision.''
   As to what indications China has given that it might be open to
U.S. pressures for change, he said, ``Watch what happens.''
   ``It takes time,'' he said. ``In the long run, looking at the
big picture, looking forward, having an idea of what the world is
going to look like six months and a year from now, the president
will be fully vindicated in his decision. I am hopeful that you
will see progress in China.''
   As to why the administration is willing to deal with a country
that has gone in the opposite direction while reforms sweep other
communist nations, Quayle said China is ``probably ahead'' of the
Soviet Union in economic reforms. But he acknowledged, ``As far as
the political context, the advancement of human rights, of allowing
peaceful dissent, sensitivity toward civil rites, China has got to
move forward.''
   Quayle was asked why the attitude is different toward China from
what it is toward Cuba and Nicaragua, two small countries that come
under frequent and harsh attack by Bush for being out of step with
democratic movement in this hemisphere.
   Quayle said China is important as the world's most populous
country, with nuclear capability and a common border with the
Soviet Union.
   ``The president is interested in advancing human rights in China
and he knows full well that to advance human rights and make
progress you have to be engaged rather than sitting on the side
lines.''
   Quayle also said that in looking at the coming year, the
administration's toughest foreign policy challenge will be the
debate over Central America, particularly Nicaragua.
   The administration remains skeptical, he said, that the ruling
Sandinistas will hold fair elections in February as promised. The
elections will be an important factor in Bush's decision whether to
resume aid to the Contra rebels who have been trying to topple the
Sandinistas for the past eight years.
   Quayle noted Bush supports the diplomatic approach endorsed by
Congress and the presidents of the five Central American nations,
but also that ``you don't rule out any options including Contra
aid.''
   ``The elections will be very important, how they're conducted,
if they're held, what (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega does
during the election process, on election day and thereafter,'' he
said.
   Domestically, Quayle said, the administration's toughest
challenge next year will be keeping the economy moving forward.

   For 11 years, Walter Singer has been
playing Santa, but he doesn't fill the red suit out as well as he
used to _ he's lost 18 pounds since testing positive for the AIDS
virus.
   ``It's not just gays or people sharing needles who get this
disease,'' said Singer, whose year-round civic generosity has
earned him the title ``unofficial mayor for life.''
   ``Anyone can get it, even Santa.''
   Singer, a retired businessman infected during a blood
transfusion, began taking the drug AZT last May.
   He has suffered fatigue and loss of appetite and dropped in
weight from 183 pounds to 165. But he enjoyed riding on a float as
Santa in the town's Festival of Lights parade after Thanksgiving
and he plans to don the red suit and white whiskers again next year.
   Singer went public at a Rotary Club meeting last week, hoping to
call attention to the disease. He is one of the subjects of a
videotape about AIDS to be shown to 1 million Rotary members.
   Singer, a genuinely jolly man, won't wallow in self-pity. His
style is to do something about a problem. He's known his share of
tragedy, but says he's been pretty lucky, too, and wants to help
when he can.
   Fifty years ago, at 15, Singer fled Nazi Germany with his mother
and stepfather and settled in San Francisco. His father later died
in a concentration camp.
   He says he learned about the American way of life and
voluntarism when he spent about a year and a half with a couple who
took in refugees in the Los Altos Hills, 45 miles south of San
Francisco.
   After high school, he joined the Army and spent most of World
War II taking care of German prisoners of war. After the war, he
served 20 years in the reserves.
   ``I felt I had an obligation to do something for my new
country,'' he said.
   He and his wife, Marie, had a son, Mark, now 32, and a daughter
who died.
   Singer worked as an art supply salesman, then opened his own
stationery store in 1976. And he stayed busy with the Rotary and
various civic groups ``to put something back in the town.''
   ``Walter's done virtually everything to help out this city,''
said Mayor Dave Reeder. ``He and his wife are involved in
everything. He is one of those people who has always believed in
and supported the community, and is just a fine person.''
   The community honored him many times, but Singer wasn't into it
for the awards _ he just liked to help. He even came to resemble
the image of St. Nick with his jiggling paunch.
   In 1984, just before he turned 60, Singer suffered a heart
attack and underwent a five-way bypass operation. Afterward, he
bled internally and had to have surgery again.
   ``Somewhere along the line, I got six units of blood. That's
when the little bugaboo happened,'' he said, managing a chuckle at
his bad luck.
   It was early in the AIDS epidemic, and screening for the virus
in blood donors was not so sophisticated or as stringent as it
would be later.
   Last March, Singer got a letter from the hospital, saying he was
one of 8,000 patients who might have been exposed to the virus. In
May, tests identified him as a carrier of the virus.
   ``I'd read about AIDS in the paper,'' he said, ``but I thought,
`This doesn't happen to Walter. It's not a disease a person like me
gets.'''
   Unknown to Singer, the president of his local Rotary Club,
Lucien Angius, was dealing with his own AIDS tragedy. His
32-year-old son in New York told him in January that he had an
advanced case of the disease.
   Angius proposed an educational videotape about AIDS for
Rotarians in July, but Singer still didn't tell anyone about his
own problem except his family.
   Singer retired in October. On Nov. 25, Angius' son died. Last
week, Singer decided to tell his story because he felt it would
make fellow Rotarians aware that they, too, could be stricken.
   The response has been ``nothing but positive phone calls and
cards. So many people I knew, some I didn't know, called. It's been
wonderful.''
   ``I think Walter is a terribly courageous man to bring this out
into the open and help the education process,'' said Reeder. ``It's
a real sad thing, but it's opening up people's eyes to the
problem.''
   Doctors have told Singer he may have two to four more good years
before the AIDS virus begins causing severe problems.
   ``It's not a pleasant way to go,'' Singer said. ``But until
then, I plan a fairly normal way of life. My wife and I want to
travel, see the U.S. I'll still do volunteer work. I plan to keep
busy.
   ``I'll be Santa Claus again next year, and I hope for many
years,'' he said. ``It gives me a lot of satisfaction to be able to
entertain all the children.''

<HEAD>Princeton's Silent Generation Turns To Civic Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A select group from Princeton's ``silent
generation,'' busy accumulating privilege and power since the
1950s, has decided that wealth is not enough and is setting out to
change society.
   Spurred by their least silent classmate _ Ralph Nader _ 120
members of the Class of 1955 at Princeton University have set up a
non-profit organization to train future leaders, shepherd
undergraduates into public interest jobs and finance classmates who
want to tackle society's ills.
   They have already met with graduates in their mid-50s from 11
other colleges in the hope of triggering a national movement of
civic involvement.
   The 1950s era at Princeton, the expensive and exclusive, grassy
and gothic Ivy League enclave in central New Jersey, gave rise to
the tag ``the silent generation,'' when a thin but highly
publicized volume of essays revealed students more concerned with
self than society.
   ``We were known as the silent generation, notwithstanding Ralph
Nader's work,'' said Stephen M. Boyd, who heads Princeton Project
55 after practicing law in Paris and Washington. Now, he says,
``the silent generation is finding its voice.''
   ``We did graduate in a time when no one questioned our
institutions. We were all pretty proud of them. ... Now after 35
years, our education system is failing, the environment is in
trouble, families are disintegrating, people are without houses.''
   The roots of the project were in consumer advocate Nader's
objections to alumni traditions. ``We were pampered, flattered and
stroked and asked to give money, but never asked what we thought,''
he said in an interview last week.
   At a reunion last April, Nader suggested his class endow a
center to get students involved in civic affairs _ through summer
and yearlong internships in public jobs and networks to public
interest work after graduation.
   Classmate Charles W. Bray III, former ambassador and State
Department spokesman, countered that Nader's idea was not ambitious
enough, that class members needed to involve themselves as well.
   Now incorporated, the Princeton Project 55 plans to fund a
non-partisan Center for Civil Leadership in Princeton, with an
endowment between $5 million and $10 million.
   Fifteen proposed projects are being studied on issues such as
affordable housing, affordable energy and waste disposal. The first
might be launched next spring.
   Bray described a problem he'd like to see tackled: Government
spends $4.8 billion a year for the poor in Cook County, Ill.,
including Chicago, but 780,000 residents remained below the poverty
line in 1984. If the money were given directly to the poor, most
would rise above the poverty line. ``But two-thirds of that $4.8
billion goes to us _ people who run organizations and live in the
suburbs. That's not working.''
   A lifelong advocate of change and organizer of the young and
idealistic, Nader thinks he's found a catalyst for change where one
would least expect it _ in the power structure.
   ``Historically, change in this country has been driven by the
young. Never by this generation,'' Nader said. ``This group
represents the power structure. These people get their calls
returned.''
   Besides Nader, the project board includes two former U.S.
ambassadors, a former AT&amp;T vice president, a surgeon, two
professors, two foundation executives, a Washington lawyer and two
corporate presidents.
   ``Fifty-five is the age when many corporations permit early
retirement. Increasingly members of our generation are tired of
their jobs and are taking that option,'' Boyd said. ``But the golf
and shuffleboard circuit is not of interest to us.''
   At a meeting this month, they discussed their plans with
representatives of the Class of 1955 from Alverno College, the
University of Chicago, Fordham, Notre Dame, Oberlin, Spellman,
Stanford, Vassar, the University of Wisconsin, Washington
University in St. Louis, and Yale.
   After the meeting, Jack Flynn began planning to survey Notre
Dame's Class of 1955 to see if they would like to assist nearly
2,000 Notre Dame undergraduates who work on social concerns in 90
cities.
   Catherine Milton, director of Stanford's Center for Public
Service, said she is checking to see if law, medical and
engineering graduates there are interested in copying a Stanford
business school program in which graduates provide management
advice to nonprofit organizations.
   Nader said the Princeton group wants to change whole systems
that are failing. ``This is not charity,'' he said. But as one who
often has been on the wrong side of powerful interests, he warns
his classmates: ``We're not going to avoid collisions with power.''

   Treasured Walt Disney family memorabilia,
including early original drawings by the famous cartoonist, burned
in a house fire, family members said.
   ``The home was a showcase,'' said Melinda Carfagno,
granddaughter of a retired Disney executive whose suburban home
burned Friday. William Cottrell, 83, was treated at the scene and
was staying with a neighbor, Ms. Carfagno said.
   The blaze in the Toluca Lake area, about 10 miles northwest of
downtown, was blamed on a faulty furnace, Fire Department spokesman
Pat Marek said.
   Damage to the house and furnishings was estimated at about
$250,000, fire officials said. The Disney artifacts defy cost
estimates because they were irreplaceable, Ms. Carfagno said.
   ``He lived here for 26 years. There was a priceless collection
of antiques and original drawings and photos from the company,''
Ms. Carfagno said. ``It was an incredible archive.''
   Cottrell was married to Hazel Sewell, an older sister of
Disney's wife, Lillian. He retired in 1982 as head of the
family-owned Retlaw Corp., whose name is Walter spelled backward.

<HEAD>First Nursing School Enrollment Increase in Five Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Enrollment of new students in college and
university nursing programs rose for the first time in five years,
but this year's increase is too little to overcome an acute nursing
shortage, according to a survey released Sunday.
   The American Association of Colleges of Nursing said enrollment
of first-time nursing students in universities and four-year
colleges rose by 5.8 percent in the current 1989-1990 academic
year. About 60,522 new nursing students are pursuing the
baccalaureate degree, both full- and part-time, this year, compared
with 57,154 in the 1988-1989 academic year, an advance copy of the
survey showed.
   Combined baccalaureate enrollment, including first-time students
and registered nurses returning for bachelor degrees, is 89,546 in
the current academic year, compared with 87,700 a year ago, an
increase of 2.1 percent.
   ``Student enrollment may be in the early stages of an upturn,''
said Association Director Geraldine Bednash, but she added, ``the
road to reversing the nation's acute nursing shortage remains a
long one.''
   Baccalaureate enrollment fell an ``alarming 31.9 percent'' from
1984 to 1988,'' but Ms. Bednash said enrollment increases this year
reduced that five-year slide to 17.7 percent.
   ``Overall shortages in student enrollment and in the nursing
work force will likely continue for several years,'' Ms. Bednash
said.
   In 1988, total graduations of first-time nurses with
baccalaureate degrees were 16.2 percent lower than the year before.
In 1989, graduations of first-time students _ about 16,003 _ were
still 11.3 percent below 1988 figures.
   Officials said the survey is based on data received in fall 1989
from 538 of the nation's 623 nursing schools with four-year
bachelor's degree and graduate degree programs. The association,
with more than 400 member institutions nationwide, said the report
represents 124,927 full-time and part-time students in both member
and non-member institutions in 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and U.S. territories.
   ``This is the second consecutive year in which enrollment
figures have shown some improvement,'' said Ms. Bednash. She
explained that nursing schools in the 1988-89 academic year had 7.9
percent fewer baccalaureate students enrolled than the year before,
but the decline was greatly less than the 14.5 percent drop seen
from 1986-87.
   Most registered nurses pursue continued education part-time, but
the survey indicated a dramatic 44.7 percent increase in RNs _
those with hospital diplomas or two-year associate degrees _ who
returned to school full-time during the last five years to earn the
baccalaureate degree. In 1985, there were 4,151 RNs who returned,
compared with 6,010 in 1989.
   ``The data reflect the growing numbers of nurses who are
furthering their education full-time to keep pace with the
increasing complexities and treatment and technological advances in
today's health care system,'' said the survey.
   Ms. Bednash said, ``The signs of change are promising, including
expanded interest in nursing as a rewarding and secure career as
seen in increased student applications to schools of nursing.''
   For the current academic year, qualified applicants totaled
16,962, compared with 14,813 in 1988-89, an increase of 14.5
percent. The numbers of students accepted by schools of nursing
this year _ at 14,717 _ increased by 14.4 percent over last year's
total of 12,861.

   Three weeks ago, while ``Prague
Spring'' hero Alexander Dubcek stood triumphantly on a balcony over
a sea of pro-democracy demonstrators on Wenceslas Square, Jiri Ruml
sat alone in a cell.
   Since then, the editor of the underground Lidove Noviny
(People's Newspaper) has been released, and his life has been
transformed from that of a dissident journalist jailed for
defending civil liberties to head of a flourishing, legal biweekly.
   Donations have been pouring in from all over the world to help
the newspaper get on its feet, including a $10,000 grant from the
Paris-based Fund for Censorship, which groups six Western press
associations.
   The newspaper is founding a publishing house that will print
magazines and books, including an anthology of articles from Lidove
Noviny in its samizdat days.
   Since his release, Ruml has worked non-stop editing the next
edition of the newspaper, giving endless rounds of interviews to
foreign journalists and attending countless political meetings.
   ``I don't eat, I don't sleep, I just prepare Lidove Noviny,
which at my age is not so easy,'' said Ruml, 64. ``But finally we
can do this and I will be leaving something good to the young
people who take over.''
   Banned by the Communists, the underground newspaper
clandestinely printed only 450 copies that circulated among about
10,000 dissidents and supporters hungry for information, rather
than the propaganda published in the official press.
   More than 500,000 copies will be printed for distribution on
Wednesday, the first since the pro-democracy revolution ended
Communist domination of the government.
   Among the first acts of the new opposition-approved government
sworn in a week ago was the firing of the official state censor.
   Now, even the Communist Party dailies Rude Pravo and Pravda
carry news. Instead of Pablum and propaganda, each day's pages
offer reports on formerly taboo subjects like the secret police and
corruption in the highest party circles.
   Only a month ago, editors made weekly visits to the Communist
Party press office to hear about the previous week's ``errors'' and
receive ``advice.''
   Offensive passages were deleted, offensive publications were
confiscated before they hit the street and some journalists who
operated too far from the party line, like those editing samizdat
journals, wound up behind bars.
   All that is changing.
   ``It will be a challenge,'' Ruml said, ``but I think we will be
successful. The best writers will want to work for us.''
   Many of the best writers in Czechoslovakia already have,
including playwright Vaclav Havel, leader of the opposition Civic
Forum and the most popular man in Czechoslovakia. His article
``Goodbye, Samizdat,'' will run on the front page ahead of Ruml's
editorial, ``Everything is different.''
   Three weeks ago, Ruml was in his 6-foot-long cell at Ruzyni
prison, awaiting trial on charges of acting ``out of hostility
toward the socialist state.''
   ``I was very isolated,'' he recalled. ``But on the night of the
23rd I suddenly heard people shouting `Long live Charter 77' (an
opposition group) and then I heard another person shout that Dubcek
had given a speech on Wenceslas Square. I knew something big had
happened outside.''
   The next day he exchanged cigarettes for a newspaper and read
about the enthusiastic welcome given Dubcek, leader of the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms who was ousted and discredited after the
Soviet-led invasion in 1968.
   The newspaper also reported a ground-breaking meeting between
then Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec and members of the
pro-democracy opposition, including Ruml's son.
   ``So I thought to myself, if he can sit with Adamec, why should
I be sitting in this jail. The next day I was out,'' he said.
   Within hours he was addressing thousands of supporters outside
the Laterna Magika Theatre (Magic Lantern), headquarters for the
Civic Forum.
   His paper, once shunned as the voice of hopeless dissidents,
became the noble voice of the new Czechoslovakia.
   ``We knew this would happen but it came sooner than expected.
Still, it was long, long overdue.'

<HEAD>Bulgarians Demand Funeral Service for Victims of Stalin Purges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several thousand protesters Saturday
demanded an official funeral service for the victims of Stalinist
purges, including a Communist Party chief who was hanged after a
show trial 40 years ago.
   The demand from members of the pro-democracy movement came
during a rally in Sofia commemorating the former party leader,
Traicho Kostov, who was convicted of spying and stirring up
hostility against the Soviet Union.
   An unidentified speaker at the rally accused Vasil Kolarov, who
was premier at the time, of conspiring to arrange Kostov's
execution on Nov. 16, 1949, and of sending hundreds of people to
Stalinist camps in the Soviet Union.
   Others said Kostov was killed because he resisted Soviet orders
on trade.
   The crowd chanted ``We want the names of the killers!''
expressing outrage over a Stalinist terror campaign in Bulgaria in
the 1940s and early 1950s.
   Around the time of the Kostov trial, 1,080 people, including
party and military officials, were prosecuted, the official news
agency BTA said Friday. No official publication has ever said how
many poeple died in the purges.
   The rally came amid swift political developments in Bulgaria,
where hard-line Communist Party leaders were ousted in the face of
large pro-democracy demonstrations. In one concession, officials
condemned the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of neighboring
Czechoslovakia, saying ``history has proved it to be wrong and
incompatible with the new course'' of the Bulgarian Communist Party.
   A resolution adopted at the rally Saturday said a bust of Kostov
should replace a memorial to Kolarov located behind the mausoleum
of national hero Georgi Dimitrov in the center of Sofia. It also
called for erecting a ``monument to all victims of the Stalinist
system in Bulgaria.''
   The resolution demanded that a commission be formed to
investigate and publish all crimes committed during the Stalinist
years in Bulgaria.
   Kostov was Bulgaria's most prominent victim of show trials
organized in Eastern Europe at the time at the request of Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin.
   The aim of these purges was to liquidate those leaders who
advocated a ``national road to socialism'' in their respective
countries.

<HEAD>Baby Costs Racing Ahead of Inflation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Babies are becoming luxuries, with the cost of
getting them through just the first year nearly double what it was
a generation ago, according to a business magazine.
   In their first year of life babies cost $5,774 in goods and
services, reports American Demographics, a magazine that analyzes
consumer trends.
   A Department of Agriculture study calculates the cost of a
baby's first year at between $5,096 and $5,602, but researcher Mark
Lino says that analysis is being updated and the figures are
expected to increase.
   A Life magazine report in 1958 calculated the cost of baby's
first year at just $800 worth of goods and services.
   Allowing for inflation, that would be $2,892 today.
   And once parents opt for this luxury there's no turning back,
with the cost of raising a child through age 18 estimated at
$100,000, reports Blayne Cutler, a senior editor of American
Demographics.
   Nonetheless, Americans produced 3.9 million offspring last year,
according to the National Center for Health Statistics. That was a
2 percent increase from the year before, although short of the 4.2
million births recorded in 1958.
   In his comparison with the costs of 1958, Cutler observes that
parents today face expenses that wouldn't have occurred 30 years
ago.
   ``Few families needed day care 30 years ago. Today, more than
half of first-time mothers are back at work before their child
celebrates a first birthday,'' reported Cutler. Day care costs
today's parents an average of $53 a week.
   ``Car seats, disposable diapers, formula and sophisticated
photographic equipment also add to the expense facing first-time
parents,'' Cutler wrote.
   Car seats are required by law, infant formula is urged by
physicians and disposable diapers are demanded by harried parents,
Cutler said.
   During the first year the average baby requires 3,000 disposable
diapers, according to Cutler. These cost $570.
   Food and feeding equipment will cost parents $855, he estimated,
with a cost of $995 for furniture, $352 for clothing, $223 for
bedding and bath supplies, $396 for medicine and personal-care
products and $199 for toys.
   Cutler's estimates for baby's first year are close to, but a bit
higher than, those calculated by the government's Family Economics
Research Group.
   That agency figures getting an urban baby through its first year
would be least costly in the Northeast at $5,096. A baby would cost
$5,138 in the Midwest, $5,523 in the West and $5,602 in the South.
   Those figures take a set of 1960 estimates and update them for
inflation, explained Lino, who is currently updating the figures.
   ``We will be adding new items such as child care, that is
expected to be a big item,'' he said. In addition, extra costs will
be added in for such things as disposable diapers, car seats,
higher transportation costs and other items, he said.
   Over 18 years the West is the most expensive place to raise a
child, the Department of Agriculture figures.
   While Cutler used a national average of $100,000 for 18 years,
Lino calculated the cost of 18 years of parenting at $116,995 for
residents of the West, $114,483 in the South, $110,891 in the
Northeast and $105,055 in the Midwest.

   A university wants to recruit minority high
school graduates with a special interest in volleyball, even though
their math and science grades may be just average.
   A soon-to-graduate high school senior wants to stay near home
and pursue a career in nursing but doesn't know where to find
information on the best vocational education courses.
   Richard Frazier, founder and chairman of Collegiate Research
Services Inc., likes to think he can help both with his new
computer service, ACCES, the American Career and College Entry
Service.
   Sophomores and juniors at participating high schools complete,
free of charge, a 45-minute, 23-page survey that details their
future education and career interests and preferences. Frazier said
in a recent interview that the survey goes beyond standardized test
scores, grade point average and geographical location.
   Colleges, universities and trade schools use the student
profiles to try to determine who will likely succeed at their
institutions.
   Nearly 14,000 high schools had registered to participate by the
end of November and the goal is to have 17,000 high schools
throughout the United States and American overseas schools around
the world by January, said Frazier, who wants to have about 4
million students profiled in the one-line computer network.
   By next fall, information will be available to post-secondary
institutions that pay fees ranging from $2,000 to $6,000 a year.
The goal is to have 4,000 subscribers by late next year, said
Frazier.
   ``ACCES is for the entire student population,'' he said. ``There
are very few programs offered that have benefits for every single
student across the entire class. That's what makes it unique.''
   Frazier recalls his own unpleasant experience contemplating life
after high school.
   His admission application was rejected by Brown University. ``I
was a very good student but scored poorly'' on college entrance
exams, he said.
   ``I think `Gee, if someone had taken the time to say here is a
kid with good grades, still working and attending a competitive
high school,' perhaps I would have stood more of a chance,'' said
Frazier, who eventually enrolled in Norwich University, a military
college in Vermont, before transferring to Catholic University
   With ACCES, he said, ``We're hoping to accomplish two things:
get these students involved early on in their high school years _
get them thinking and planning their journey beyond high school.''
   Recruiters can find those students who usually are missed or
overlooked because they have no plans to take college entrance
tests or have bleak chances of graduating, they said.
   ``We're giving these institutions a way to identify students
they never had before and we're giving them information in a
manageable format,'' said Grogan.
   ACCES was designed over a period of four years, evolving from a
service focusing on students with special needs. Assisting in the
project was a national advisory council of educators, business
leaders and policymakers from such organizations as the National
Council of Educational Opportunity Associations, the Committee for
Economic Development, and the National Association of Secondary
School Principals.
   David Dunaway of the secondary school principals group said that
although the program is ``very intriguing,'' the organization has
declined to endorse the service until further review.
   ACCES ``has the potential to be an outstanding product,'' added
Dunaway, principal of Benjamin Russell High School in Alexander
City, Ala. He said his school has not subscribed because of
concerns over the security of the information given by the students
and the time needed for the students to complete the survey.
   As for security, Frazier said only postsecondary institutions
accredited by bodies recognized by the Department of Education or
the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation are eligible to
subscribe to the network. State employment and training agencies
also can join so students can learn about job training
opportunities or internships, he said.

<HEAD>Ethnic Shooting, Killing Continues Despite 24-Hour Curfew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HYDERABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen killed three people and
wounded about 20, police said Saturday, despite a shoot-on-sight
curfew aimed at quelling a week of ethnic violence in this southern
Pakistani city.
   Hospital sources said another person died of wounds inflicted
the day before, bringing the death toll to 15 since Monday.
   The fighting is between natives of Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's home province of Sindh, and immigrants from India called
mohajirs. Authorities routinely refuse to state the ethnic origins
of victims in order to avoid reprisal killings.
   Police, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity, said
unidentified gunmen defied Saturday's curfew, killed two gas
station attendants and fled. A third man apparently was the victim
of a rooftop sniper.
   Police and army troops patrolled the narrow, squalid streets in
machine gun-mounted jeeps but there was sporadic shooting around
the city all day, eyewitnesses said.
   Authorities gave the shoot-on-sight order Friday, the Moslem
sabbath, after three people were killed and nine others were
wounded during a brief curfew break for prayers.
   Hundreds have been killed and thousands have been wounded in the
past three years in clashes between the two groups in Hyderabad and
Karachi, Pakistan's largest city 90 miles to the southwest.
   The mainly rural Sindhis claim the mohajirs have squeezed them
out of jobs, especially in urban areas. The mohajirs claim they are
victims of discrimination, and have called for the same official
ethnic status in Pakistan as native Sindhis, Punjabis, Baluchis and
Pathans.

<HEAD>All the Views That Are Fit to Print: Is Times' Theater Critic Too
Powerful?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Can a bad review kill a good show?
   A growing number of Broadway producers, writers and theater
people say the answer is yes _ if it's in The New York Times.
   The long-simmering debate boiled over recently when British
playwright David Hare's latest drama, ``The Secret Rapture,''
closed shortly after Times drama critic Frank Rich soundly panned
it as ``coarse agitprop'' and ``so pallid an imitation of life.''
   Rich was not the only critic to voice unfavorable opinion. The
Daily News called the play ``too calculated, too schematic''; New
York Newsday called it flawed but fascinating.
   But as Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center
Theater, put it, Rich uses ``hydrogen bombs where ordinary
old-fashioned artillery would do.''
   Hare, best known for his 1978 play ``Plenty,'' fired off a
letter to Rich, calling him irresponsible and ``gratuitously
abusive.'' Rich responded with a letter acknowledging ``the
consequences of my reviews,'' but considering himself honor-bound
to express his opinion.
   The feud landed on the front page of the trade newspaper
Variety; excerpts from both letters were printed in such diverse
publications as The Wall Street Journal and the Village Voice.
   Hare's sentiments are not uncommon in the theater world, where
shows are becoming more expensive _ both to produce and to see. The
complaints are usually expressed privately, but some people are
speaking out.
   Katharine Hepburn gave the producers of ``A Few Good Men'' a
favorable quotation to use in their advertising after Rich trashed
the drama last month.
   ``It's difficult and discouraging for any play to be mounted now
_ it costs so much _ and people don't always go,'' she told
columnist Liz Smith. ``So I wanted to say that people have to make
up their own minds. They have to read more notices than just one
critic.''
   The 40-year-old Rich, who joined the Times in 1980, has clout
that is unrivaled among critics in any other major art form.
   When reviews are mixed, said press agent Merle Debuskey,
``You'll find the show either succeeds or fails on what the Times
critic has said.''
   Rich described this season's ``Prince of Central Park'' as ``a
numbing evening of ... guileless amateurism''; the play folded
after four performances. He called rock star Sting ``a stiff'' and
his show, a revival of ``3 Penny Opera,'' an ``inert gray mass.''
Despite a $4.5 million advance, it closes New Year's Eve after only
a two-month run.
   But a rave from Rich can translate quickly into box office
dollars.
   ``City of Angels,'' a new musical without big stars, was taking
in about $18,000 a day in advance ticket sales before it opened,
according to general manager Ralph Roseman. The day after it opened
to mixed reviews _ but lavish praise from Rich _ the box office
take was $324,700.
   Although impossible to quantify, many in the theater world
believe Rich also has closed a good number of shows.
   In his letter, Hare said much of the problem is Rich's
unwillingness to pull punches when he writes a bad review.
   ``It is not your job to make my play run,'' he wrote. ``But nor
is it your job to close it. And you did close it. Not by what you
wrote, but by the manner in which you wrote it.''
   Yet a bad Rich notice is not always fatal. Lewis Allen, producer
of ``A Few Good Men,'' said the box office is struggling but alive
for his show, a drama about military justice.
   Rich has had little affection for Andrew Lloyd Webber, but the
British composer's ``Phantom of the Opera'' is still the hottest
ticket on Broadway and ``Cats'' has been running since 1982.
   Rich declined to be interviewed for this story. In his letter to
Hare, however, he acknowledged the influence of the Times, adding,
``its credibility is a trust that all its writers work hard to
preserve.''
   Hare called on the Times to find a replacement for theater
critic Walter Kerr, who provided a second opinion with his separate
reviews for the Sunday paper before retiring in 1983.
   Warren Hoge, the Times assistant managing editor who oversees
cultural coverage, said he is ``very close'' to hiring a second
front-line critic.
   ``Frank himself would love to have some of the pressure
removed,'' Hoge said.
   Clive Barnes, the Times theater critic for 10 years before going
to the New York Post in 1977, said he had his own run-ins with
producers when he was in Rich's shoes.
   Barnes believes many producers are just looking for a scapegoat
if their plays bomb: ``You have to remember that most of these
shows that get terrible notices are terrible shows.''

<HEAD>Gov. Mofford Criticized for Commuting Sentences, Then Flip-Flopping</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rose Mofford's decision to commute the
prison terms of two convicted murderers and her sudden about-face
has voters, talk-show hosts and politicians questioning her
competence and political savvy.
   The 67-year-old Democrat was elevated to governor last year from
her largely ceremonial elected post as secretary of state upon the
impeachment conviction of Republican Evan Mecham. The questioning
of whether she is a lightweight or a leader comes as Mrs. Mofford
begins gearing up for an election campaign next year.
   The immediate furor centers on commutations Mrs. Mofford signed
several months ago that became public only recently.
   Carl Kummerlowe, 62, whose commutation was signed in May, had
been sentenced to life in prison for bludgeoning a service-station
manager to death in 1969, dismembering his body and packing it into
ice chests for disposal.
   James Hamm, whose commutation was signed in July, had been
sentenced to life in 1974 for killing two drug dealers near Tucson
to steal their profits.
   The Board of Pardons and Paroles had recommended the
commutations, saying both men had been model prisoners who had
rehabilitated themselves and deserved commutations so they could
become eligible for parole earlier.
   Mrs. Mofford said she knew both were murderers but says she
wasn't given the board's full report about them. Board officials
say detailed files on the men were supplied to her office and that
Mofford aides apparently summarized them for her.
   One lawmaker, Peter Goudinoff, says he thinks the storm will
blow over by election time next November.
   ``The real issues are down the road: budget, taxes and to some
degree (auto) insurance,'' says Goudinoff, a Democrat who teaches
political science at the University of Arizona when the Legislature
isn't meeting.
   But other lawmakers say Mrs. Mofford has wiped out any progress
she had made before the controversy.
   ``Everybody feels sorry for her,'' said Republican Leo Corbet,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``She's a nice lady,
but she's about 12 leagues over her competency level.''
   Mrs. Mofford declined to be interviewed for this story. Her
in-house political expert, special assistant Rip Wilson, said,
``There's no question the governor can be staffed better.''
   When she first became chief executive, lawmakers and voters
found Mrs. Mofford's low-key style a welcome relief from the
constant controversy that swirled about Mecham, whose sharp tongue
alienated many minorities and other groups.
   But lawmakers criticized her after this year's first legislative
session as someone more interested in cutting ribbons than running
government.
   In October, when state agencies sought more than $1 billion in
spending hikes for next year despite a looming state financial
crisis, Republicans said the inflated budget requests were proof
that Mrs. Mofford couldn't manage her agencies.
   In November, Mrs. Mofford called lawmakers into special session
on auto insurance but abandoned it when the going got unexpectedly
rough.
   Just last week, Mrs. Mofford stunned state labor leaders who
form a key constituency when she accepted an award from an
anti-union group, the latest in a series of slaps at organized
labor.
   The commutations controversy might have blown over quickly if
Mrs. Mofford had stuck to her guns, lawmakers say. After all,
former Gov. Bruce Babbitt commuted the sentences of 26 convicts and
even the arch-conservative Mecham reduced a murderer's sentence.
   But Mrs. Mofford did an about-face when criticism of the
commutations arose, announcing Tuesday that she would take the
whole thing back if Attorney General Bob Corbin said she had the
authority to do so.
   Corbin did her one better, announcing Friday that he had found a
technical loophole to void the commutations retroactively before
they even got to Mrs. Mofford's desk. He found the victims'
families had not been properly notified of the pending commutations.
   The governor also made contradictory statements that left voters
puzzled.
   At one point, for example, she said that no murderer should be
allowed back on the streets. Minutes later, she said that she had
known that Kummerlowe and Hamm were murderers before she commuted
their sentences.
   Calls to radio talk shows were running heavily against Mrs.
Mofford. Some radio talk show hosts, like Bob Mohan of KFYI in
Phoenix, have blasted her for commuting the sentences. Others, like
KFYI's John Dayl, have accused her of ``hiding on the ninth floor,
curling up into a fetal position'' at the slightest criticism.
   There has even been criticism from the Democratic camp.
   Mrs. Mofford's floor leader in the House, minority leader Art
Hamilton, said, ``I think it would be less than honest not to admit
some concern.''

<HEAD>Navy's Top Officer Says `Nyet' To Naval Arms Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy's top admiral says the Soviet Union
may be able to achieve much of what it wants in naval arms control
``by just sitting back and waiting'' for budget pressures to pare
away the U.S. fleet.
   ``It is not in the interest of this country to have a weak Navy,
or even a weaker Navy,'' Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, the Chief of
Naval Operations, said in an interview last week in his Pentagon
office.
   The admiral, reviewing the results of the recent Malta summit,
firmly rejected any move towards entering naval arms control
discussions with the Soviets, a stance taken by President Bush in
his talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In the interview, Trost also took a tough line on impending
budget cuts, contending it would be difficult to expect the service
to take on additional duties _ such as the war against drugs _ with
fewer ships and personnel.
   ``If we are to have the capability to respond ... as we are
called on repeatedly, we need the force we have now as the absolute
minimum,'' he said.
   If not, the admiral warned, ``you're meeting the same
commitments with fewer forces. ... Your ability to respond goes
down, the burden on your personnel goes up.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has been ordered to keep Pentagon
spending to $292 billion for the next fiscal year, a level 2
percent below the anticipated inflation rate.
   And in order to keep expenses in line with anticipated tight
budgets in the coming years of 1992 to 1994, the secretary has also
ordered the armed services to come up with plans to cut some $180
billion in projected spending over the coming years.
   The admiral declined to comment specifically on reports that the
service plans to meet Cheney's directive by cutting ship strength
from 562 ships to 500 _ including two to three aircraft carriers _
and Navy and Marine Corps manpower by 40,000.
   But he noted that the Soviets are keenly aware that economic
belt-tightening is in Washington's future.
   ``They do understand the political process,'' he said. ``They
can look to achieve much of what they want to achieve just by
sitting back and waiting.''
   Trost said the Soviets continue to press for naval arms control
``because their goal is to constrain the capability of the U.S.
Navy, which they have repeatedly stated is one of their greatest
concerns.''
   At Malta, the Soviets reportedly spelled out new, more stringent
conditions for an accord on submarine-launched cruise missiles,
indicating they want a deal on those weapons concluded in tandem
with a strategic weapons treaty that is supposed to be ready for a
summit in June.
   Trost rejected Soviet assertions that anti-cheating measures
could be worked out to check for the presence of nuclear-tipped
cruise missiles on ships or submarines. The admiral said there are
too many ways to cheat, or ``break out'' of the an agreement by
hiding the small, lethal weapons.
   ``The ability to verify such things as sea-launched cruise
missiles is nil,'' he said. ``(There's) no chance of coming up with
a good, comprehensive system that covers everything, at all times,
and guarantees against break-out.''
   The United States has also rejected the idea of allowing Soviets
on board their ships and submarines as ``too intrusive'' a way to
check for the presence of the weapons.
   ``Verification is a major problem,'' he said. ``It can't easily
be wished away.''
   The admiral, who delivered the same message directly to Soviet
naval officers during a six-day visit to the their country in
October, said President Gorbachev's push for curbs is a recognition
of the strength of the U.S. force, as well as economic pressure.
   ``What you're seeing is a reflection of an honest concern of the
capability _ the deterrent affect _ of a strong U.S. Navy ... and
the realization that competition with us is expensive,'' the
admiral said.
   To those who would say that the Soviet threat is lessening,
Trost argues: ``I remind them that the political statement of
threat has gone away, but the military capability remains. ...
(Even) if we see a total reduction of Soviet naval capability, ...
our requirement for a Navy remains, because we have a lot of people
around the world who aren't always friendly'' to U.S. interests.
   The admiral expressed some skepticism when asked about reports
that President Bush and other top members of the U.S. adminstration
have received intelligence reports for months saying the Soviets
had ordered defense cutbacks, but the officials continue to warn of
a growing Soviet threat.
   ``If there is such a nice, concrete black-and-white intelligence
result, I'd like to see it,'' Trost shot back.

<HEAD>Industry Officials: Record Fine Shows How Illegal Aliens Dispersed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An unprecedented $580,000 fine imposed on
a pillow factory accused of hiring more than 100 illegal aliens in
a rural town reflects how shrinking job markets in border states
have dispersed immigrants, officials said.
   The civil fine levied Wednesday against Piedmont Quilting Corp.
in Walhalla is the largest imposed by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service under a 1986 law that penalizes employers
caught hiring illegal aliens.
   The INS also pursued a criminal case, and last week, the
company, its owners and nine managers were indicted on charges of
illegally recruiting and harboring 117 illegal aliens.
   In a July raid, immigration officials said they found 85 illegal
aliens from Mexico and Peru working at the plant, including a
12-year-old boy earning $4 to $5 an hour doing menial labor. All
were deported. Subsequent investigation raised the number of
illegal aliens alleged to have been hired at the plant to 117.
   Walhalla, population 4,000, is near Sumter National Forest,
about 15 miles from the Georgia and North Carolina borders in
northwestern South Carolina.
   Police Chief John Gillespie said he contacted the INS after
several plant workers stopped for traffic violations and other
minor offenses could not produce proper identification.
   Fred Alexander, deputy district director of the INS regional
office in Atlanta, said the agency tends to focus enforcement
efforts on urban areas, ``where we feel they are likely to do the
most good.''
   But while the Walhalla raid was unusual, it may be readily
explained by economic trends, beginning with depressed job markets
in Texas and Louisiana.
   ``People are traveling east for jobs and this particular group
found them in Walhalla,'' Alexander said.
   The INS does not plan to concentrate on the Southeast's textile
industry in the wake of the Piedmont Quilting case, Alexander said.
   ``I think it is by far and away the exception rather than the
rule,'' said Frederick B. Dent Jr., president of the 80-member
South Carolina Textile Manufacturers Association.
   Dent, who also is president of Mayfair Mills in Arcadia, said
even though his company cannot find enough workers, it would not
resort to hiring illegal aliens.
   ``We would rather have jobs go unfilled than to break the law
and incur the penalties and the public disgrace the Piedmont
problem brought,'' Dent said.
   ``You hear of those things in New York and Texas and border
states but it's the first time I've heard of it here,'' said James
Walsh, president-elect of the South Carolina Needle Trades
Association and manager of Lexington Sportswear. ``I think it's an
isolated incident.''
   However, possible violators of the 1986 immigration law
``probably have more of a likelihood of not being discovered'' in
the South because the INS' main resources and personnel are in
Texas and California, said Donald A. Young, officer in charge of
the agency's office in Charlotte, N.C.
   In the indictment handed up Tuesday in Greenville, Piedmont
Quilting owner Alfred Mizhir, 55, and his wife, Gail Mizhir, 30,
both of Spring Lake, N.J., face possible prison terms of 653 years
and fines totaling $5.1 million if convicted on all charges.
   The nine other indicted company managers or officers also each
face up to 653 years in prison if convicted.
   The criminal charges resulted from a six-month investigation
that included the use of an undercover INS agent who posed as a
plant worker, immigration officials said.
   INS officials reported working conditions were unsafe for
children, who were confronted by large machinery and 150-pound
bales of fabric used to make pillows, quilts and comforters.
   The administrative fine also covers the company's failure to
comply with procedures to verify that the plant's more than 400
employees were not illegal aliens, INS officials said.
   The company, which has 30 days to contest the civil fine, has
refused to comment. Attorney Bill Bannister, who represents
Piedmont Quilting, did not return calls to his office Friday.

<HEAD>Researchers Studying Accidents Roll Tractors Over Hill _ On TV Screen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>URBANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Coddington flips tractors over,
rolls them down hills and wrecks them _ but the accidents he causes
are all on a computer screen. It's all part of a research project
to make the most deadly workplace, the farm, a little safer.
   Coddington and Bob Aherin, agricultural engineers at the
University of Illinois, developed the computer simulation so they
could observe factors that lead to accidents on the farm.
   Agriculture leads the National Safety Council's list of the most
deadly occupations. There were about 1,500 farm deaths and 140,000
disabling injuries nationwide in 1988, according to the
Chicago-based organization, which had no individual state figures.
   Tractor roll-overs are the leading accidental cause of
farm-related deaths in Illinois, accounting for about 30 percent of
them, according to the Country Companies Insurance Group of
Bloomington.
   ``The goal is to find out what contributes to an accident and
what protective devices will help the farmer,'' said Coddington.
``I would think manufacturers would find this useful in designing
new equipment.''
   The computer allows the researchers to specify things like the
weight, wheelbase and center of gravity of the tractor, plus the
slope of the hill. They take into consideration factors like wet,
slippery fields.
   ``I'd like to know if it is going to roll, how long it will take
and the total energy'' unleashed during the rollover, he said.
   Coddington punches in some data on his keyboard during a recent
test, and a tractor appears on the screen. Its right wheels slide
off the edge of a hill, its left wheels lift off the ground, then
bounce back down.
   ``It tried but it didn't turn over,'' he said. ``It tipped, then
rocked back.''
   The information is changed, and again the tractor tips.
   ``Now, as it goes past the point of no return, it will roll
over,'' said Coddington.
   What can make the difference between a tractor that rolls over
and one that stays on its wheels? A lower center of gravity and
wider wheel spacing can be designed by engineers, but they stress
that the care exhibited by the person behind the wheel is always a
factor, too.
   ``Manufacturers try to make their equipment safe and post
warnings about hazards,'' said Coddington. ``But people are crazy.
They'll use equipment in no way, shape or form the way it was
intended.''
   The computer simulation not only may help manufacturers design
safer equipment, but could increase farmers' awareness of dangerous
conditions, the researchers say.

   It's after school on a brilliant wintry day,
but there are no children romping in the snow at the Woodside
Apartments where 5{-year-old Melissa Lee Brannen disappeared from a
Christmas party two weeks ago.
   At the school bus stop, where perhaps one mother might have
stood with a dozen children last month, now three or four mothers
wait, says resident Sally Marquis, whose 2{-year-old son Daniel
played with Melissa for hours at the apartment complex party from
which the little girl vanished.
   ``Those who aren't there, you can see them lined up at the
bottom of the stairs,'' keeping an eye on their youngsters from a
distance without embarrassing those who think they're grown up
enough to wait alone, she said.
   The middleclass neighborhood around the modern Woodside complex
is ``tense, scared,'' resident Susan Kunze said.
   ``Usually you see kids out all the time, at all hours, but
lately it's rare that you see a kid out alone without a parent or
at least a friend,'' she said.
   The Kunze children _ Diane, 9, and Joseph, 10 _ know their
quiet, shy little friend Melissa has disappeared. They also had
been taught at school and at home, long before Melissa vanished, to
be wary of strangers and to scream and run if someone tried to grab
them. ``I'd scream and kick him in the shins,'' declared Joseph.
   But when a reporter they'd never met knocked on their apartment
door, the two flung it open with a cheerful, ``Hi!'' They left it
wide open as they raced to get their mother.
   Being wary of strangers is a lesson that takes time to seep in.
   When 10-year-old Rosie Gordon, another Fairfax County resident,
was abducted and killed last July, ``Everyone was shocked that it
could happen,'' says Tammy Brannen, Melissa's 27-year-old mother.
   But people at the Woodside Apartments adjacent to the towering
trees of Fort Belvoir didn't take any special precautions. ``I
don't think we ever associated it with happening to us,'' she said.
   Ms. Brannen, who was divorced 2{ years ago and moved to her
apartment in August 1987, seems numb.
   ``It still doesn't really seem real,'' she whispered during an
interview last week. ``At times, it seems like she's over at my
parents or at school and she's going to walk in the door at any
minute.''
   Fairfax County Police Officer Michael Proffitt said, ``We like
to think that since it doesn't happen that often, that we're
somewhat immune from it ... but then we're shocked back to reality
that no one is immune from something like this.''
   The whole region is alert, he says, reflected by the hundreds of
phone calls from concerned citizens. Unfortunately, very few
represent solid leads.
   Proffitt said Melissa's case has generated far more rumors than
any other case in the county.
   One false rumor broadcast by some radio and television stations
was that Melissa's body had been found in a trash bin.
   Ms. Brannen was angered by that report and by reports that an
apartment complex maintenance man had failed lie-detector tests and
had refused to help police although his wife said he was home late
Dec. 3, immediately washed his clothes and cut out parts of his
shoes with a knife. Later reports said the FBI and police had
searched the man's home and emerged with boxes of possible evidence
and were checking blood stains found in his vehicle.
   ``If people hear that, they'll quit looking for her,'' Ms.
Brannen said.
   Police and hundreds of volunteers have conducted numerous
searches of the area, but they have curtailed those until they get
new leads, Proffitt said.
   Despite the area's middle-class, residential nature, about 30
miles south of Washington, D.C., Fairfax County has had its share
of trouble. In addition to the Rosie Gordon slaying, a third-grader
was raped last year in an elementary school restroom.
   That incident prompted the Fairfax County Public Schools to
institute a comprehensive child-safety program for the children and
staff, said Assistant Superintendent Dolores Bohen. Crisis
counseling teams are routinely sent into schools when needed, she
said.
   There are no solid numbers on how many missing children there
are, as these cases are not always reported and there is no central
clearinghouse for the information.
   Scott Mandel, on loan from the Corpus Cristi, Texas Sheriff's
Office to The Center for Missing and Exploited Children, estimated
that at any point, 1 million to 1.5 million children are missing,
of whom the majority are runaways or so-called throwaways, children
kicked out by their parents. Most return the same day, he said.
   The next largest number are parental abduction cases, involving
50,000 to 300,000 children, he said.
   Police confirmed that Melissa's father, Michael Brannen, a toy
store manager in Garland, Texas, who has not seen the girl in two
years, was in Texas when she disappeared. Police don't think her
disappearance is part of a domestic dispute.
   As for abductions by strangers, he said, the center had heard of
511 cases during its first five years of operation ending Sept. 30.
Of those, 158 children had been returned alive, 112 were located
dead. The rest are still missing.
   Ms. Brannen, a single parent who was working as an accountant
for a defense contractor and part-time for two jewelry stores,
rarely sleeps these days. She's never alone. Family and friends
answer the phone.
   She castigates herself for not being more cautious about Melissa
although she estimates it took only two minutes at most for Melissa
to vanish.
   ``You can say lots of `I should have dones,''' she says. ``I
shouldn't have taken her to the party.''
   ``The not knowing is the toughest part,'' says Mandel. ``...To
get a feel for what it's like, a moment of what they're going
through is when you lose your child in a mall. Those 10 minutes
turn into what some of these parents have gone through for 10
years. ... Those moments of hell that you went through momentarily
is what they're living.''

   A state trooper wounded in the 1972
assassination attempt on Gov. George C. Wallace died of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound in a hospital where he was being
treated for terminal cancer. He was 58.
   Capt. E.C. Dothard, who served 5{ years as state public safety
director, shot himself Friday night at Anniston's Stringfellow
Hospital, where he was diagnosed earlier in the week as having a
terminal malignancy, trooper Lt. James Hyatt said Saturday.
   Dothard joined the governor's security detail in 1963 during the
first of Wallace's four terms.
   In May 1972, he suffered a grazing gunshot wound to the stomach
when Wallace was shot and paralyzed while campaigning for president
in Laurel, Md. One co-worker said Dothard was ``still barking out
orders while on the ground after being shot.''
   A Secret Service agent also was wounded in the assassination
attempt.
   Wallace issued a statement through longtime aide Elvin Stanton
saying Dothard ``was almost a member of my family.''
   ``He was a very close personal friend and a fine citizen who
gave his entire life to law enforcement,'' said Wallace. ``He
traveled all over the world with me and was injured when I was
shot. My prayers and deepest sympathy go out to his entire family.''
   Wallace's assailant, Arthur Bremer, is serving a 53-year
sentence.
   Seven months after the shooting, Wallace appointed Dothard
director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. He held the
post until April 1978, when he resigned to return to his hometown
of Anniston. At the time of his death, Dothard was serving as
commander of the Jacksonville trooper district.
   Dothard is survived by his wife, Virginia, and four children.

<HEAD>City Council Rejects Watergate Figure Maurice Stans' Gift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHAKOPEE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Watergate figure Maurice Stans' offer to
donate his family home and a new museum to the city has been
rejected because officials don't want to be responsible for the
upkeep.
   Stans, the onetime Cabinet secretary who pleaded guilty to minor
campaign violations in the Watergate case but was acquitted of more
serious charges, said he wanted to show young people in towns like
Shakopee that they can make it big outside their small communities.
   He offered to turn over to the city the family home, a small
adjacent park and a museum that he would build.
   Stans was deputy postmaster and budget director under President
Eisenhower and secretary of commerce under President Richard Nixon
as well as chairman of Nixon's campaign finance committee. He was
born in Shakopee in 1908 and lived there until he was 17.
   Stans proposed half the museum be reserved for his memorabilia
and the other half could be used by the city for other artifacts of
Shakopee, a town of 10,000 about 15 miles southwest of Minneapolis.
In return, he wanted the city to promise to maintain and staff the
buildings.
   City Administrator Dennis Kraft said Friday that the City
Council decided it did not want to make that kind of long-term
financial commitment.
   Stans was indicted along with former Attorney General John
Mitchell on 10 counts of perjury and conspiracy involving a
$200,000 contribution from financier Robert Vesco. They were
acquitted by a jury.
   Stans later pleaded guilty in a separate case stemming from
Watergate to five non-willful violations of campaign financing laws
and paid a $5,000 fine.
   Stans has continually held that he ``had absolutely no part in
Watergate.''
   Earlier, at least two members of the Shakopee City Council said
that the trial and the fine would have no bearing on their decision
on whether to accept Stans' gift.

   It won't be bristling with brawn, but
``The Men of Smith College'' calendar will have plenty of academic
appeal, say students at the all-women school.
   ``What we were focusing on was their intellect and not their
body,'' said senior Marie Macri, who thought up the idea as a
fund-raising project for ``The Porcupine Rag,'' an annual humorous
magazine she co-edits.
   The calendar, expected to go on sale in February for $4,
features models from all over campus, including professors,
security guards and a cook.
   ``We were tired of hearing there were no men at Smith College,''
said Caitlin Hamilton, co-editor of the Rag.
   Also featured in the not-yet-completed calendar are Harpo, the
pet poodle of Smith President Mary Maples Dunn, and a shot of a
nude bronze statue.
   Hamilton said the calendar isn't intended to make fun of the
models or as an exercise in reverse sexism. Models had the final
say on the pictures used and a statement attached to the calendar
states its role as a tribute to the men of campus.
   Associate art professor Craig Fulton said he had no qualms about
posing once he discovered the academic focus of the publication.
   ``I think this shows the seriousness of the students at Smith,''
Fulton said Friday. ``Once the body goes, the mind is left. Let's
hope the mind continues.''

   The city's hotels are trying to
keep tourists happy by offering a free night for any complaint
about their visit, from too much heat to too little sun, from
hangnails to hangovers.
   The Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau
devised the three-month program, in which 41 hotels are offering
customers a free night if they return for another visit.
   ``Whatever the cause _ a few minutes of rain showers or too many
minutes of sunshine _ we'll make it good,'' said Richard Weaver,
the bureau's president.
   There are a few stings attached: The second trip has to be made
before Dec. 31, 1990; the tourist has to pay for at least two other
nights before getting the free one; and the tourist has to be among
the first 250 to complain at any given hotel. That's how many
vouchers each hotel has agreed to give out.
   ``We want to make sure if someone has a bad experience, we want
to make it better,'' said Nicki Grossman, chairman of the Tourist
Development Council, the bureau's governing board.``When they go

<HEAD>Government Praises Sakharov But Still Fights His Movement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leaders eulogized Andrei D. Sakharov on
Saturday as an honest and sincere humanitarian, then dove back into
a parliamentary battle with the very opposition movement he helped
found.
   In what amounted to a public apology, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
other leaders signed an obituary that appeared in Saturday's
newspapers saying Sakharov, who died Thursday, had been the victim
of ``gross injustices.''
   ``A distinguished scientist and public figure, a man of honesty
and sincerity has passed away,'' the obituary said in the
government's highest public praise for Sakharov since he turned in
the 1960s from a prize-winning physicist into the dean of Soviet
dissidence.
   ``Everything that Andrei Dmitrievich did was dictated by his
conscience, his deep humanitarian convictions,'' it said.
   But within hours after the newspapers came out, the leadership
was back fighting the feisty parliamentary group that Sakharov
urged to become a full-fledged opposition just before his death.
   The group, which numbers about 400 of the Soviet Congress' 2,250
deputies, has denounced many government policies but shied away
from actually declaring itself an opposition.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov hit back at the Sakharov
faction at Saturday's Congress session, implying that it was
plotting subversion by opposing his program for economic reform as
too conservative.
   He said it was ``no accident'' that the faction, the
Inter-Regional Group, rejected the government program as not
radical enough and proposed putting off a decision on the economy.
``That will take away the opportunity to stabilize the situation in
the country,'' he said.
   The Inter-Regional Group, meanwhile, pressed forward toward a
compromise on whether it will become a true opposition as Sakharov
wished.
   The faction will issue a declaration on its opposition to
specific government policies on Monday, said historian Yuri
Afanasyev, one of the group's leaders.
   Afanasyev, speaking to reporters in the lobby of the Kremlin's
Palace of Congresses, also broached the idea of starting a
nationwide democratic movement named for Sakharov.
   ``During these days of mourning we have to think about how to
fill in the enormous gap that was left in the democratic movement
with Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov's death,'' Afanasyev said. ``He
represented such a powerful force that he took the place of several
such movements all by himself.''
   For the second day, crowds of mourners massed outside the
10-story, gray building where Sakharov lived.
   About 150 people gathered on the snowy sidewalk in front of 48
Chkalova Street, weeping and reminiscing about Sakharov and his
ideals, placing red and white carnations on makeshift shrines and
lighting candles before his portrait.
   ``Thanks and forgive us _ the stupid ones,'' read an entry in a
notebook for mourners' comments lying on a small table. A candle
stood atop a small box bearing the inscription, ``The mind, honor
and conscience of our nation has died.''
   Sakharov's body is to lie in state in the capital's Youth Palace
on Sunday and burial is planned the following day.
   Afanasyev complained that the Congress had not properly honored
Sakharov's memory on Friday. With just a brief speech and minute of
silence, the government made itself look bad when faced with ``such
a loss, equal to the death of Tolstoy, Churchill or Gandhi.''
   The youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda accused the deputies
who made even that formal show of grief for Sakharov of being
hypocrites.
   ``I could not shake off the thought that in that very hall, and
not so long ago, Sakharov stood on the tribune and ended his speech
with people applauding (derisively), stomping their feet and
shouting at him,'' reporter Pyotr Voshchanov wrote. ``What did he
feel then, and what do those people who tried to force him off feel
now?''
   The official government obituary signed by Gorbachev, five other
members of the ruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other
leading officials and scholars was printed along with a picture of
Sakharov on page 4 of the party daily Pravda.
   Such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and
scientists, and Pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 Nobel
Peace Prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a
funeral commission in a black box on its front page.
   Missing from the obituary were the signatures of several other
Politburo members, including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and
leading conservative Yegor K. Ligachev. Absence of their signatures
could signify that they disagreed with part of the obituary.
   The obituary praised Sakharov's vision as a scientist, which
made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences at age
32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the Soviet
hydrogen bomb.
   Sakharov later sacrificed the perks and honors due a top
scientist to pursue a human rights campaign that spanned three
decades and made him the conscience of the nation. It also resulted
in him being subjected to internal exile, force-feeding and KGB
harassment. Gorbachev freed him in 1986 after nearly seven years in
exile in the remote city of Gorky.

<HEAD>Two Convicted In First British-Soviet Drug Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One man was convicted of smuggling hashish and
another of money laundering in the first British-Soviet drug
investigation, and officials say political reforms in Eastern
Europe should lead to further cooperation.
   A jury at Chelmsford Crown Court east of London deliberated 13
hours before finding the men guilty on Friday. Three others had
pleaded guilty in September and two were acquitted.
   The operation was the first success of a 1987 agreement between
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to exchange information and work together to fight drug
trafficking.
   Operation Diplomat began after Soviet customs officers on the
Afghan border found 3{ tons of high-quality black Afghan hashish
concealed in a consignment of licorice root destined for Britain.
   Soviet authorities allowed British officers to track the $16
million worth of drugs to find the smugglers.
   The hashish traveled through Moscow and traced to the Tilbury
docks outside London, where it arrived on March 31. Several weeks
later the drugs were taken to a London warehouse where police and
customs agents arrested the British smugglers.
   British customs officials say no Soviets were arrested.
   During the Britons' 11-week trial, Vladimir Skripnik, a senior
Soviet customs officer, became the first Soviet law enforcement
official to testify in a British court.
   ``Cooperation is only possible as a result of the changes that
have taken place and are now taking place in the Soviet Union,'' he
said afterward. ``This would have been impossible not long ago.''
   Douglas Tweddle, Britain's chief customs investigator, said
further joint investigations were expected, and that Britain hoped
for similar cooperation with other Eastern European countries in
light of recent political reforms.
   ``Operation Diplomat ... is an excellent example of how such
agreements can help both parties,'' he said.
   The jury convicted Martin Reeves, 42, of smuggling nearly 3{
tons of hashish and Andrew George, 37, of laundering drug money.
   Judge Brian Watling delayed sentencing until he receives a
request from Britain's Customs and Excise authorities for the
confiscation of more than $8 million of their assets.
   Earlier, James Rose, 53, who was described as the leader of the
drug ring, and Alan Small, 54, pleaded guilty to conspiring to
import hashish between August 1984 and April 1988. Rose's son,
Richard, 25, pleaded guilty to importing the drug.

<DATELINE>POTSDAM, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drive across the bridge past
impassive East German border guards was both without precedent in
American history and a bold but risky venture.
   The quiet motorcade to Potsdam carried Secretary of State James
A. Baker III where no secretary of state had gone before and
committed the Bush administration to a rescue operation for East
Germany as winter approaches.
   In his 65-minute meeting with Hans Modrow, the reformist prime
minister, and a second session in a 19th century church with
Lutheran ministers who helped bring down the old discredited
rulers, Baker heard a tale of a tenuous regime struggling to make
it to multiparty elections in May and fearful of a violent
revolution from the streets.
   Baker, the highest-level U.S. official ever to venture into East
Germany, has plunged a once-cautious Bush administration into the
maelstrom of German politics, the reunification debate and a
uniquely dangerous display of what he calls ``people power.''
   Tuesday's foray, after breakfast with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and a symbolic visit to the disintegrating Berlin Wall,
topped a busy five-day trip to Europe in which Baker also advanced
a ``new architecture'' for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and strengthened U.S. ties to the 12-nation European Community.
   Baker neared the end of his trip Saturday when he joined
President Bush on the Caribbean Island of St. Martin, where Bush
was discussing East-West relations with French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   The accelerating sweep of economic and political change in
Eastern and Central Europe calls for policy adjustments in the
West, especially from the United States, from a Cold War posture of
confrontation.
   The Soviets are adjusting too. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze will call on NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner at his Brussels headquarters _ not for negotiations, the
former West German defense minister said.
   When Poland and Hungary first broke away from orthodox
Communism, the Bush administration responded with what leading
congressional Democrats and many analysts considered to be undue
caution _ even timidity.
   Congress forced increases in aid programs and pushed the White
House to respond to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's bold
arms control programs and need for Western technology and economic
advice.
   One of the decisions taken while Baker attended a two-day
meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels was a call for a
logical system of separating sensitive technology from other
material that can safely be exported to the East.
   ``We think it's still important to protect strategic technology,
but we should rationalize the process to the extent that things
that are available to some extent off the shelf are not locked up
in a bureaucratic process _ particularly at this time of
significant reform,'' Baker said Friday at a news conference in
Brussels.
   This time around, as Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and especially
East Germany shed hard-line leaders and Marxist economics, the Bush
administration is out front with the promise of the same kind of
aid given Poland and Hungary if they keep it up.
   There may even be a special food grant to assist the Modrow
government through the winter and to give it better than a 50-50
chance of surviving to hold the elections scheduled for May.
   The ministers Baker saw on Tuesday told him the next stage in
the East German revolution could be retribution against former
party officials and the military.
   While Baker was in Europe there were more reports of attacks on
security officers and performers who had enjoyed privileges under
the old order. On Tuesday, while Baker was in Berlin and Potsdam,
the novelist Kristof Hein said in an interview with the communist
youth newspapers Junge Welt that East Germans had to guard against
creating ``new injustices.''
   Otherwise, he said, ``in 20 years, we will not only be
commemorating the victims of Stalinism, but we'll also have to
rehabilitate the victims of de-Stalinization.''
   Baker's public statements after seeing Modrow harped on one
theme _ that the political and economic changes must be brought
about peaceably.
   ``It is that, as much as anything else, that represents the
political signal that we desire to send by being here today,'' he
said standing alongside the embattled prime minister in a crowded
hotel driveway.
   The trip to Potsdam, where the allied leaders in World War II
made preparations for dealing with a defeated Germany and a
partitioned Berlin, was not on Baker's schedule when he set out for
Europe last Sunday.
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Barkley is credited with persuading
Baker at a meeting Monday night to go to Potsdam the next day to
show support for the East German government.
   Baker sent a cable to Moscow reassuring the Kremlin the visit
was not intended to be provocative and he crossed the Glienicke
Bridge in a stately motorcade that attracted little attention from
onlookers.
   It was the same bridge the late American U-2 pilot Francis Gary
Powers and celebrated Jewish dissident Natan Scharansky crossed to
the West after being freed from Soviet prisons.
   Baker urged Modrow to press ahead with political reform. He
soft-pedaled the explosive issue of reunification with West
Germany, which has jangled nerves in Poland, the Soviet Union and
France.
   While economic reunification appears inevitable, Baker wants
political union to be gradual.
   In Brussels, Baker urged the NATO allies at the annual winter
foreign ministers meeting to consider the ``new architecture'' for
Europe he had outlined in a speech Tuesday to the Berlin press club.
   The plan is designed to transform the 40-year-old military
alliance as East-West tensions ease into a mixture of political,
economic and military elements.
   The allies liked several of the specific Baker proposals. They
will consider setting up panels to monitor troop reductions in
Europe and taking on the role of referee for regional conflicts.
   Stopping next at the European Commission, Baker won support for
stronger U.S. ties to the European Community as it moves toward
economic integration of Western Europe in 1992.
   On a third front, Baker participated in decisions by a group of
24 nations to commit $6 billion in economic assistance to Poland
and Hungary over the next several years.
   Baker, who had told his partners that `pledges of aid are not
enough,'' was pleased with the overall Western response.
   But, he said Friday night, ``In the final analysis, it is going
to be up to the people of these countries, the people power that
has generated these peaceful revolutions. It is going to be up to
them to determine whether or not it succeeds.''

   A man who entered the federal witness
protection program after testifying against a New York City cocaine
ring has pleaded guilty to resisting arrest.
   The man, with the single name of Arjune, entered the guilty plea
Friday under an agreement with county prosecutors. District Judge
Charles Dorn accepted the prosecutors' recommendation that Arjune
be neither jailed nor fined.
   A second misdemeanor charge of failure to obey an officer was
dismissed.
   Arjune, 47, was living in Spokane under the name of Amos Hardeen
when he alleged that he had been beaten and called a racial slur by
a police officer who stopped him Sept. 1 for allegedly speeding.
   Police Chief Terry Mangan rebutted Arjune's claims, saying he
was claiming racial harassment to cover his crimes and had falsely
accused Officer Patricia Madsen. Mangan and Ms. Madsen said Arjune
ran a stop sign and assaulted the officer in front of his house
after she followed him home, although no assault charges were filed
by the prosecutor's office.
   As a result of the dispute, Arjune's identity became public and
he has since been moved to another town.
   Arjune was a key prosecution witness in a major cocaine trial in
New York City. He also testified against two people convicted in
the Feb. 26, 1988, shooting death of Edward Byrne, a rookie police
officer who was guarding Arjune's house at the time.
   The shooting gained national attention last year as a symbol of
the drug problem when Byrne's parents appeared with
then-presidential candidate George Bush and he cited the
policeman's slaying as a reason to support the death penalty.
   Arjune and Ms. Madsen both said they passed lie-detector tests
verifying their accounts of the Sept. 1 incident.
   ``I'm sorry for what happened,'' Arjune said in court Friday.
``As long as I live in this world, I would never hurt a police
officer.''

   Christian patriarchs said Saturday they will
cancel festive holiday visits and limit celebrations in sympathy
with the uprising in the occupied lands, where violence persisted
with the killing of a Palestinian by fellow Arabs.
   The office of the Roman Catholic Patriarch, Michel Sabbah, said
Sabbah met with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Diodoros
I, and other Christian leaders to discuss the ``deteriorating
situation' in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Sabbah, the first Arab to head the Catholic Church in Jerusalem,
supports Palestinian demands for an independent state.
   The patriarchs decided to issue a Christmas message voicing the
need for justice and peaceful settlement of the conflict; to
restrict Christmas celebrations to liturgical services and prayers
for justice and peace; and to cancel all Christmas visits and other
festivities ``in sympathy with those who mourn their beloved ones.''
   The decision followed Thursday's announcement in the West Bank
town of Bethlehem and neighboring Beit Sahour that Christmas
celebrations would be canceled for the third year in a row to
support the uprising.
   In east Jerusalem's village of Jabel Mukaber, police found the
body of a 46-year-old Palestinian and said he apparently was
murdered because he was a suspected collaborator with Israel.
   The national news agency Itim said the victim, Khalil Kareen,
was stabbed to death inside his home. Kareen was found in a pool of
blood on the floor, his hands tied behind his back and his head
covered with a rag, it said.
   It was the first such killing in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem,
and it brought to 159 the number of Palestinians murdered by fellow
Arabs on suspicion of being pro-Israeli agents during the two-year
uprising.
   In addition, 631 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
gunfire and 43 Israelis have died.

<TEXT>
   The two Germanys are negotiating a
major exchange of imprisoned spies, but the deal could be delayed
because some of the Communist agents don't want to return to the
East, a newspaper said Saturday.
   The Bonn-based paper, Die Welt, said four American agents
imprisoned in East Germany as well as 18 West Germans may become
part of the spy exchange.
   The newspaper said that in return, the Soviets and East Germany
want the return of five of their top agents jailed in West Germany
and four who are in U.S. prisons. All would be delivered to East
Germany, the newspaper said.
   Die Welt did not identify the reputed American agents, nor did
it identify the sources that provided the information in its report.
   A West German government spokesman said he ``had no
information'' about a pending spy swap and would be unable to
discuss the matter if he did.
   Bild am Sonntag, a mass-circulation Sunday newspaper based in
Hamburg, reported that East Germany plans to free a number of
Western agents, but in exchange for additional financial aid from
West Germany.
   The newspaper, which did not identify its sources either, said
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Premier Hans
Modrow would discuss the matter during their summit in Dresden on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Bild am Sonntag telexed its report to news agencies in advance
of Sunday's scheduled publication.
   Die Welt said the spies that could be released include Margret
Hoeke, who was a secretary to five West German presidents before
1985, when she was exposed as an agent for the Soviet KGB
intelligence agency. Two years ago, Ms. Hoeke, 54, was convicted of
providing classified information to the Soviets and is serving
eight years in a West German prison.
   Die Welt said Ms. Hoeke is among several spies who have refused
to move to East Germany even if she were pardoned.
   ``She will not even accept a temporary stay over there, but
would rather continue serving her sentence,'' Die Welt reported.

<HEAD>Man Suspected of Spying Says FBI Tail Is Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Felix S. Bloch, the diplomat suspected of spying
for the Soviets, said Saturday it appears he no longer has FBI
agents trailing his every move.
   ``It was strange,'' said Bloch, a 30-year State Department
veteran who came under FBI surveillance last spring, but has never
been charged with any wrongdoing. ``It was as if they left from one
minute to the next.''
   FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz acknowledged there may have been
some ``visual changes'' but the investigation continued.
   ``We may have cut back, but we're still investigating,'' he said
Saturday. ``I have no comments beyond that. But it is an active
investigation.''
   Bloch, who spoke to a reporter in a Washington grocery store
near his home, said: ``I like my freedom.'' He said the obvious FBI
tail appeared to have faded away about a week and a half ago.
   In July and August a host of journalists and camera crews joined
the government agents in following Bloch everywhere, including long
treks in the capital and up to New York to visit his relatives.
   Bloch, 54, declined to comment further, saying his attorney told
him not to speak to reporters.
   Intelligence experts have said that even if round-the-clock,
``wheel-lock'' surveillance were dropped, a less obtrusive
surveillance might take its place. In that instance, agents might
regularly drive by or check back to see that a target was keeping
to his usual schedule.
   Such less obtrusive surveillance could be accomplished without
the target's knowledge, these experts have said.
   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Times in Saturday's editions cited
sources as saying the FBI has failed to find solid evidence to
support espionage charges against Bloch and has all but abandoned
hopes of prosecuting him. Steinmetz declined to comment.
   The State Department put Bloch on administrative leave on June
22, saying the FBI was investigating him in connection with
allegations of ``illegal activities'' involving ``agents of a
foreign intelligence service.''
   Intelligence sources have said Bloch, who served at U.S.
embassies in East Germany and Vienna, passed a briefcase to a
Soviet agent last May in Paris. That same agent later was monitored
giving Bloch what U.S. officials said was a telephone warning that
he was under suspicion, the sources have said.
   Other electronic surveillance is said to have picked up Bloch
telling his wife that he had accepted payments from the Soviets. A
former Viennese prostitute has told a federal grand jury that Bloch
spent roughly $10,000 a year for her services over seven years _ an
amount that investigators cannot find withdrawn from Bloch's
acknowledged bank accounts.
   In a September interview with the Austrian daily Die Presse,
Bloch said he would write a book to set the record straight. But he
repeatedly has passed up chances to deny the allegations, saying
instead the government has not been able to bring charges, much
less prove them.

   Actor Timothy Hutton has filed for divorce
from actress Debra Winger after 3{ years of marriage and asked for
joint custody of their 2-year-old son.
   Hutton, who starred in the film ``Ordinary People,'' for which
he won an Oscar, as well as ``The Falcon and the Snowman,'' and
``Taps,'' cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the
divorce, according to court papers filed Thursday.
   The couple married March 16, 1986, and separated last May,
according to the divorce petition filed by attorney Dennis R.
Dubrow.
   The couple's son, Emanuel Noah Hutton, lives with Miss Winger in
Santa Monica.
   Miss Winger's film credits include ``Terms of Endearment,'' ``An
Officer and a Gentleman,'' and ``Betrayed.'' She married Hutton
shortly after breaking off a highly publicized romance with
the-Gov. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Kerrey is now a U.S. senator.

<TEXT>
   Marjorie Westbury, one of Britain's best-known
radio actresses, died of cancer Saturday at the age of 84.
   She was told she had cancer two weeks ago and died at her
farmhouse near Uckfield in Sussex in southern England, her friend
Helen Bohan said.
   Miss Westbury was best known for her 30 years in the role of
Steve, the wife of radio detective Paul Temple in Francis
Durbridge's series on the British Broadcasting Corp
   In the 1950s she won two radio awards as outstanding actress of
the year. Her work was so admired by one fan that she left Miss
Westbury about $42,000 in her will in 1957.
   Born near Birmingham, Miss Westbury won a scholarship to the
Royal College of Music in London and began her professional career
as a singer in 1932, when she sang Gretel at the Old Vic for Lilian
Baylis. She started singing on the radio the following year.
   In 1942, during a rehearsal break with the BBC Midlands Singers,
a producer heard her imitations and offered her her first speaking
part.
   Her last major work for radio was her 50th anniversary play in
1983, when she chose to perform in ``Waters of the Moon,'' choosing
her own cast which included acting friends Mary Wimbush, Patricia
Hayes and Martin Jarvis.
   John Tydeman, head of BBC radio drama, called her a ``highly
accomplished and versatile actress'' and said her voice remained
``pure and perfect throughout her long life.''
   Miss Westbury, who never married, lived alone.

   Gov. Rose Mofford says she agrees with the state
attorney general's assessment and will tell the state parole board
that her commutations of two murder sentences are void.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin's opinion Friday said the
commutations of James Hamm and Carl Kummerlowe could be considered
void because the parole board that recommended them earlier in the
year did not fully comply with a victim-notification law.
   ``The attorney general's opinion confirms my original belief
that these commutations were flawed and must be considered void,''
Mofford said in a statement.
   Hamm and his wife, prisoner-rights activist Donna Leone Hamm,
would not comment on the ruling. Kummerlowe has refused to comment
in the past and was unavailable because of an alleged disciplinary
lapse that placed him in lock-up.
   Kummerlowe, 62, was sentenced to life for the 1969 killing of a
service-sation manager who was bludgeoned to death, dismembered and
packed into ice chests.
   Hamm, 37, was sentenced to life in prison in 1974 for two
drug-related murders.
   The judge who sentenced Kummerlowe said he should never be
paroled and former Gov. Bruce Babbitt rejected the parole board's
recommendation in 1986 that Kummerlowe's sentence be commuted.
   Both inmates were model prisoners who had rehabilitated
themselves through service to others, the parole board had said.
Mrs. Mofford said she based her decision to commute the sentences
earlier this year on that report.
   Corbin said Friday that there were no Arizona cases detailing a
governor's power to reverse commutations and that courts in other
jurisdictions had split over the issue.
   The victim-notification law requires notification to the
victim's family, prosecutors and a judge before any commutation or
parole hearing, Corbin said, and there is no evidence that the
notifications were sent out to all the necessary parties.
   Board chairman Arter Johnson, a Mofford appointee, did not
return calls immediately.

<HEAD>Tehran Ends Naval Maneuvers In Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's divided military forces Saturday
completed their most extensive maneuvers in the Persian Gulf in a
decade and proved they could work together, Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted navy commander Rear
Adm. Ali Shamkhani as saying that some ``good and amazing results
were gained in the maneuvers.''
   He said the exercise demonstrated that the regular armed forces
could effectively coordinate with the Revolutionary Guards to repel
any threat, the radio reported.
   The 350,000-strong Revolutionary Guards were formed during the
1979 Islamic revolution as an ideologically reliable force to
counter an army trained under the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   But the regular navy, army and air force were constantly at odds
with the Revolutionary Guards during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war,
which has been halted by a cease-fire since August 1988.
   Both forces have opposed efforts to merge them, but President
Hashemi Rafsanjani has combined the defense and Guards ministries
to streamline the chain of command and improve coordination.
   The Iranian air force and regular army also participated in the
maneuvers, which covered 7,500 square miles of the gulf and the
adjacent Gulf of Oman, the radio said.
   It said that more than 10,000 men took part and that ``tens'' of
navy destroyers, missile craft, troop carriers, hovercraft, jet
fighters, mine-detecting helicopters and Revolutionary Guards
vessels were involved in carrying out complex electronic warfare
operations and amphibious landings.
   Tehran television, also monitored in Nicosia, showed a number of
patrol boats, destroyers, hovercraft and landing craft in the Gulf
on Friday.
   The radio said the Revolutionary Guards, who have their own air
and naval wings, used for the first time two new types of
Iranian-built speedboats armed with small, multiple rocket
launchers.
   The vessels, classed as Imam-1 and Imam-2, were constructed by
the Revolutionary Guards' defense factories, the report said.
   Rafsanjani said last month that his navy had acquired ``vital
equipment'' that would enhance its capability.
   He did not elaborate, but Western military analysts believe Iran
may have deployed Chinese-made Silkworm missiles on its ships. None
of the vessels shown in the television broadcast appeared to be
armed with Silkworms.
   The analysts said Iran's navy is short of U.S.-made ship-to-ship
Harpoon missiles and has been seeking a new seaborne system.
   Iran is believed to have test-fired a ship-borne Silkworm
missile in the Gulf three months ago.
   The 58,000-ton USS New Jersey sailed through the Strait of
Hormuz into the Persian Gulf just before the maneuvers began Dec. 9.
   The battleship, the biggest warship to sail into the gulf in
recent times, left the waterway Tuesday for its regular station
with a U.S. naval task force in the Arabian Sea.

   One hundred fourteen members of the House
asked the State Department on Saturday to launch an official
inquiry into reports of arrests and torture of demonstrators in
East Timor following Pope John Paul's visit there on Oct. 12.
   In a letter drafted by Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio, the bipartisan
congressional group asked Secretary of State James A. Baker III to
order the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta to ``investigate the events
surrounding the demonstration and its aftermath'' and to urge the
Indonesian government to allow any detainees to be examined by
doctors selected by their families.
   The letter said as many as 40 people may have been detained
after a demonstration by nationalists who shouted slogans praising
the Pope and demanding independence from Indonesia, which occupied
East Timor in 1975. The former Portuguese colony is predominately
Roman Catholic.
   ``We are concerned about reports that several of those arrested
were tortured to extract `confessions,''' the letter said. ``While
such reports are difficult to verify, they would fall into a
well-established pattern in East Timor and throughout Indonesia of
mistreatment and abuse of detainees in the period immediately
following arrest.''
   State Department spokesman Mark Dillen declined immediate
comment on the request Saturday on grounds that officials had not
yet reviewed the letter.

   A light airplane with six people aboard
disappeared during a snowstorm in eastern New York, and a search
Saturday was hampered by bad weather, authorities said.
   The missing twin-engine Piper Navaho took off Friday afternoon
from Glens Falls Airport, 50 miles north of Albany, bound for
Orange County Airport just north of New York City, said Ann
MacMillan, spokeswoman for the Civil Air Parol. The private plane
was reported about 30 miles south of Albany when it disappeared
between 5:30 p.m. and 6 p.m., she said.
   Blustery weather hit much of New York about the time the plane
took off. As much as 7 inches of snow fell in the northern Catskill
Mountains, where the plane was last reported.
   Planes searching Saturday south of Albany were buffeted by high
winds and blowing snow, MacMillan said. The weather forced the six
rescue planes to call off their search, she said.
   Sightings of low-flying aircraft Friday afternoon were reported
from the Massachusetts border to Utica in central New York, forcing
searchers to look for the plane in a half dozen counties, she said.
   ``We're still plotting courses'' and haven't determined exactly
where the plane might have gone down, she said.
   About 90 state troopers, forest rangers, Army National Guardsmen
and other rescuers were on foot looking for the plane, MacMillan
said.
   Searchers had not picked up the plane's emergency signal, she
said.
   The plane was based at Robbinsville-Trenton airport in New
Jersey. MacMillan said she could not release the names of those
aboard.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa led about
1,000 people Saturday in marking the anniversary of the killing of
scores of Baltic Coast workers by security forces during
pre-Christmas food riots in December 1970.
   The annual observance at the towering monument to slain shipyard
workers just outside the famed Lenin Shipyard has in the past been
an occasion for conflict betwen demonstrators and police.
   But with Solidarity now legal and leading Poland's government,
Walesa used the occasion to tell the crowd, including union
delegations from around Poland, that the slain workers of 1970 and
of the December 1981 martial-law crackdown did not die in vain.
   A similar message was sent to the gathering by Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, himself a longtime Solidarity activist and
political prisoner.
   ``I deeply believe that in the Poland which we are now building
such a sacrifice will never be needed again,'' Mazowiecki said.
   Now, Walesa said, Poles must steel themselves for the difficult
period ahead as the government submits a tough economic austerity
program to Parliament Sunday.
   Urging Poles to accept the painful measures, he said, ``The
greatest Polish tragedy ... would be to try to solve complicated
economic problems of the country in the streets.''
   ``Let our children enjoy what we will build for them, and not
have to sacrifice their lives to mend what their parents spoiled,''
he said.
   ``Today to the fallen shipyard workers we must erect a different
monument. Let it be a just, democratic and prosperous Poland.''
   Scores of shipyard and port workers were killed in 1970 during
riots and strikes that erupted in Gdansk, Gdynia and Szczecin when
the Communist leadership of Wladyslaw Gomulka announced sharp food
price increases just before Christmas.
   Walesa, then a young shipyard worker, participated in the
strikes and later became active in illegal efforts to memorialize
the victims, whose exact number has never been known.
   After the rise of Solidarity in 1980, one of the union's first
acts was to dedicate the monument of three steel crosses to the
slain workers at the shipyard gate on Dec. 16 of that year, the
10th anniversary of the outbreak of the riots.
   Walesa recalled Saturday that at that dedication, he did not
imagine that just a year later nine Silesian coal miners would be
gunned down in Katowice in a ``second December'' _ the martial-law
crackdown authorities ordered to crush Solidarity.

   Bidders at an art auction here on Saturday panned
a pen-and-brush piece purported to be drawn by Pablo Picasso, but
two people expressed interest in buying the work privately, said an
auction spokesman.
   Officials at Kruse International, an Auburn, Ind., auction house
specializing in the sale of vintage cars, said last week that they
expected to fetch bids as high as $3 million to $5 million for the
previously unknown portrayal allegedly by Picasso of his mistress.
   ``The piece went up on the block this morning,'' said Pat
Scanlon, a spokesman for Kruse. ``There were no bids. It is now
being offered for private sale.''
   The owner of the drawing, jewelry engraver Jim Montgomery of
Norman, Okla., said he was given the work 11 years ago by a young
couple he had helped out financially.
   Montgomery said the work's authenticity was verified
scientifically by Ernest Smith, a forensic document examiner from
Oklahoma City, but art experts said the verification process needed
to be much more detailed.
   ``I suppose all the media attention could have scared away
bidders,'' Scanlon said in a telephone interview. The weather,
hovering around 5 degrees as the auction was held at a downtown
hotel, could also have been a factor.
   The portrait of a young woman probably will be sold privately to
one of two people who expressed interest after the auction, Scanlon
said. He refused to comment further on a possible sale price.
   Doubts about the piece's authenticity persist.
   Francoise Gilot, whom the piece is supposed to portray, said
Friday that she was skeptical the work was real because she was
never contacted about it.
   Ms. Gilot, the mother of Picasso's son Claude and daughter
Paloma, modeled for Picasso from 1944 to 1953 when they lived
together.
   ``If they want to know if it's correct, they would ask my son or
myself or my daughter,'' said Ms. Gilot, herself a painter now
married to Dr. Jonas Salk, a medical pioneer in polio.
   ``The fact that they did not ask anybody in the family is not a
good sign,'' she said in a telephone interview from New York.
   But Montgomery defended his decision to verify the work through
a document expert rather than art historians, saying he had heard
the process has been used in the past to verify such pieces. After
months of waiting for the appraisal, he said, he was satisfied that
the work was indeed a Picasso.

   Medical officials say they want AIDS tests
performed during all autopsies as a step to prevent the spread of
the disease, but other state officials say privacy issues must be
considered.
   ``This is a serious disease, a lethal, contagious disease, and
our hands are tied for investigation, reporting, and protecting
those around us,'' said Dr. Pierre Provost, chairman of the state
commission on medical-legal investigation. ``If we treated
syphillis like we treat AIDS, humanity would have been dead a
century ago.''
   Last week, officials in New York City said they plan to test for
acquired immune deficiency syndrome during all autopsies and to use
the results to find out who else might be infected.
   But a leading AIDS activist said the New York program is
``outrageous,'' and he will oppose any such plan in Massachusetts.
   ``The dead person can't tell them who the contacts are, so the
medical examiner's going to speculate about who the guy's
girlfriends or boyfriends are?'' said Larry Kessler, director of
the AIDS Action Committee.
   Kessler said he would not object to anonymous testing during
autopsies for statistical research.
   Mary Ann Hart, a spokesman for the Department of Public Health,
said her agency was not ready to take a position on the issue.
   Tom McNaught, spokesman for state Attorney General James
Shannon, said his office is consulting the Department of Public
Health and the medical-legal investigation commission on the issue.
   Shannon is concerned with the state's AIDS confidentiality
statutes, which require consent from anyone being tested for AIDS,
McNaught said.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk and
the leader of the nation's Zulus appealed for black-white unity
Saturday, a national holiday marking a 151-year-old battle victory
by the Afrikaners over the Zulus.
   De Klerk, an Afrikaner, told supporters in the Orange Free State
Province that he wants to open negotiations with black leaders on
the country's future.
   ``The time is now for us to all get together and get more
consensus,'' said de Klerk, who has sought to ease racial tensions
since taking office in August.
   Right-wing Afrikaners opposed to power sharing with blacks
countered with several rallies demanding strict apartheid and
continued white domination.
   In Boksburg, an industrial town outside Johannesburg, and in
Mossel Bay, a southern coastal town, blacks canceled demonstrations
to avoid confrontations with rightist groups.
   Afrikaners were celebrating the 1838 Great Trek, during which
their Dutch-descended ancestors left the British-ruled Cape Colony
for the uncharted African wilderness.
   Stories about hardships on the journey and battles with African
tribesmen have taken on mythical proportions for the 3 million
Afrikaners, who make up about 60 percent of South Africa's white
population and control the government.
   The Afrikaners, preparing for a major battle with the Zulus on
Dec. 16, 1838, vowed to make it their holiest day if they won the
fight. They did, and the anniversary is known as the Day of the
Covenant.
   Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi told 3,000 supporters at a
stadium in Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg, that it
was time to ``consider signing a new covenant.''
   ``Not between us and God, as our Afrikaner compatriots claim
they did in 1838, but a new covenant between us as white and black
South Africans,'' Buthelezi said.
   He also appealed for unity among the nation's 28 million blacks
and an end to three years of violence in Natal Province that pits
his relatively conservative Inkatha movement and the United
Democratic Front, a national anti-apartheid coalition aligned with
the African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   The front supports sanctions, protests, boycotts and other
confrontational methods that Buthelezi opposes.
   Despite his differences with the front and the outlawed ANC,
Buthelezi said: ``I will not negotiate ... with the South African
government until the day (ANC leader) Nelson Mandela is released
from jail.''
   Mandela, the country's best-known black leader, is expected to
be freed within weeks. He met de Klerk on Wednesday to discuss
prospects for black-white political negotiations.

   Six-year-old Julio Berumen, one of the
best-known victims of the Oct. 17 earthquake, has finally left the
hospital _ but not until after delaying his departure to meet
baseball star Dave Stewart.
   The boy, whose right leg was amputated during efforts to rescue
him from the collapsed Nimitz Freeway, was anxious to go home
Friday morning, until he heard that the Oakland Athletics pitcher
was visiting the hospital in the afternoon, said Children's
Hospital spokesman Steve Tiger.
   ``He said, `I'm not going,''' Tiger said.
   Julio held out and received photos of the 1989 World Series
champs with other children who met with Stewart in the hospital's
fourth-floor playroom. He also got something extra _ Stewart's own
green satin team jacket.
   The boy had been riding in a car with his mother, Petra Berumen,
and his sister, Cathy, when the quake rattled Northern California
two months ago. The children's mother died in the freeway disaster.
Cathy Berumen suffered head injuries and was released from the
hospital a month ago.
   In addition to amputating Julio's leg, doctors had to cut
through the body of a dead passenger, 45-year-old Yolanda Orozco,
to free the boy from the car.
   Tiger said doctors are pleased with Julio's progress. He will
return to the hospital three times a week for physical therapy and
may be back in school in January, he said.
   ``Julio was easily the most famous patient we've ever had,''
Tiger said, adding that he has been swamped with media requests for
photos and information since the boy came to the hospital.

   A pregnant woman who was caught
smoking crack cocaine thanked police for arresting her and urged a
judge to put her behind bars to keep her away from drugs until the
baby is born.
   Julia Gallashaw, 37, agreed to a plea bargain intended to save
her and her baby _ due Jan. 28 _ from her drug habit by putting her
in jail.
   ``She's the one who wanted to stay in there until she had the
baby,'' Palm Beach County Judge William Bollinger said Friday. ``I
wholeheartedly concurred.''
   Gallashaw was arrested Wednesday by a pair of police officers as
she smoked crack from a homemade plastic pipe.
   Initially charged with felony cocaine possession and possession
of drug paraphernalia, Gallashaw pleaded guilty Thursday to a
misdemeanor charge of attempted cocaine possession.
   The plea bargain calls for her to serve 90 days in the Palm
Beach County Stockade and nine more months on probation. She will
be required to submit to drug evaluation and treatment, court
papers showed.
   Officers Ed Wagner and David Burkhardt had asked in their arrest
reports that Gallashaw be jailed at least until she gives birth.
They said the woman thanked them as they took the pipe from her
hands.
   ``She was very appreciative for being arrested,'' Wagner said.
   He and Burkhardt were checking the hallways of a boarding house
known as a drug hangout when they came upon Gallashaw smoking crack
in a second-floor bathroom, Wagner said.
   Gallashaw told the officers she had smoked crack throughout the
pregnancy, as well as two others that ended in miscarriages.
   She said she had sought prenatal care in the early stages of
pregnancy but had trouble getting transportation to a clinic. She
said she couldn't stop smoking crack and feared she would miscarry
again.
   ``Most police officers probably would call her scum and a
criminal, but we didn't feel that way,'' Wagner said. ``She knows
smoking would hurt her baby, but she was so addicted, she couldn't
help herself.''
   Women who use cocaine while pregnant risk a premature birth or
separation of the placenta, and their babies usually are smaller
than normal, have smaller heads and show signs of learning
disabilities.

   Parents needn't fret about picking out the right
toys for their children. For $300, a toy consultant will do the job.
   Karen Ard, an elementary school teacher, has no trouble buying
toys for her 4-year-old son. She went into the toy consulting
business when she realized it wasn't so simple for others.
   Ard, 36, decided she could share her skills with parents who did
not have the know-how, time, patience or foresight to choose toys
that foster the creative and educational development of their
children.
   Her consulting service, Toys That Teach, serves New Yorkers who
have children 6 years old or under. For each child, Ard prepares an
individually tailored list of toys for parents to buy over the
course of a year.
   She charges $300, plus a 10 percent surcharge on any toys that
she buys.
   ``Many kids don't have related educational toys at all,'' said
Ard.
   Her recommendations fall into seven categories: Art, music,
reading readiness, science, math, social studies and motor skills.
   Ard takes into account age, where a child goes with friends,
what parks they play in, what classes they take and whether they
demonstrate special talents or interests. She considers the
parents' occupations and where the family vacations. An interview
with the parents and a visit to the child's room help shape the
final plan.
   ``All this is just to set a picture for the child,'' said Ard.
   Non-educational toys, Ard thinks, should be left for birthday
parties.
   ``My objective is to balance out the child's scheme in life,''
Ard said.

   President Bush suffered the ills of a
Washington winter during his afternoon visit Saturday with French
President Francois Mitterrand on this tropical island.
   During a 45-minute news conference on the two leaders' talks,
Bush coughed several times and blew his nose into a handkerchief he
pulled from his breast pocket. His voice was raspy due to his cold
and mild laryngitis.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was feeling
``the normal discomfort'' associated with laryngitis.
   During the flight Bush remained in the front of the plane
reading his briefing books and ``trying to save his voice,''
Fitzwater said.
   He said Bush was taking throat lozenges, a decongestant and
common aspirin.
   Asked if Bush became ill while sitting outdoors at the White
House tree-lighting ceremony, Fitzwater said: ``He cannot pinpoint
when it occurred'' but attrributed it to the general Washington
weather.''
   Bush had two refills of his water glass brought to the podium
and drank rapidly.
   Earlier, Bush was asked how he was feeling as he sat with
Mitterrand in a beachside gazebo.
   ``Better, thank you,'' he said. ``Doesn't hurt.
   ``Just can't talk, which is a great relief for the president of
France.''
   Bush and Mitterrand spent much of the afternoon under the shade
in the 90-degree heat of this French Caribbean island.
   They changed from the business suits to casual wear for a brief
walk along the white, sandy beach, with the waves lapping near
Bush's shoes.
   Mitterrand wore a tunic-type suit, and Bush a white
short-sleeved shirt and khaki trousers.
   Bush said he was enjoying the tropical climate, and the break
from the bone-chilling weather of Washington.

   Independent political groups at the hub
of democratic changes in four East bloc countries for the first
time mounted a joint rally Saturday and pledged close cooperation
in the future.
   ``We are only now beginning to find each other in the common
European House,'' said Jozsef Antall, chairman of the Hungarian
Democratic Forum.
   He was speaking to the rally inside a packed hall in Budapest
after a two-day meeting of the groups. About 600 people attended
the rally, with each participating group speaking of its history
and aims.
   A joint communique adopted at the end of the rally hailed the
revolutionary reforms this year in Eastern Europe as ``a process
characterized by political pluralism, human dignity and human
rights.''
   ``This is a historically unprecedented opportunity for our
nations, which can be realized only through cooperation and not by
selfish national interest,'' it said.
   Delegates represented Poland's Solidarity labor movement; the
East German New Forum; the Czechoslovak groups Democratic
Initiative, Civic Forum, Charter '77, Glasnost Against Violence and
the Independent Hungarian Initiative representing the Hungarian
minority in Slovakia; and the Hungarian Democratic Forum that acted
as host of the session.
   Referring to the issue of German reunification, the joint
declaration stated that ``our basic principle is the people's right
to self-determination, to which the East Germans are also entitled.'
   However, it added that ``German reunification can only be
realized as part of the European process of integration.''
   The groups further declared a common goal of eliminating all
vestiges of Stalinism.
   They said they want to set up an international forum to
coordinate their activities and called on all democratic
organizations in Eastern Europe to join.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Saturday he was
``delighted'' by the Colombian government's action against a
cocaine cartel leader and hailed it as a ``courageous effort''
against drug terrorists.
   In Bogota Friday, police shot and killed Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha, 42, during a raid on his hideout on Colombia's northern
coast. Rodriguez Gacha's 17-year-old son Freddy and five bodyguards
were also killed.
   ``I was delighted yesterday when the Colombian government
brought to bay the, I think the man who is ranked the third most
prominent narco terrorist in Colombia, Mr. Gacha,'' Bush said
during a news conference after meeting in the Caribbean with French
President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``It was a very courageous effort on the part of the
Colombians,'' Bush said of action against the traffickers, who have
been blamed for 203 bombings that have killed 199 people since last
August. The drug lords then declared ``total war'' on the
government in retaliation for President Virgilio Barco's policy of
extraditing drug suspects to the United States.
   ``We have all different kinds of terrorism. This narco terrorism
is simply outrageous and unacceptable, and when we see a president
of an embattled country, and Colombia fits that description, doing
its level best to bring them to justice, I think we ought to salute
them,'' Bush said at a joint news conference with Mitterrand, where
the two leaders discussed a variety of subjects.
   Earlier in the week, Bush announced he would travel to Colombia
next year for a drug summit despite security concerns.
   On Friday, national drug policy chief William J. Bennett called
Rodriguez Gacha's killing ``very important psychologically to the
Colombian people and I think to the American people.
   ``The notion that the cartel leaders are invincible is put to
rest,'' Bennett said.

   President Bush discussed the changes
in Eastern Europe with French President Francois Mitterrand on
Saturday, and said the United States would be ``very responsive''
to any request for emergency wintertime food aid from East Germany.
   Bush said that except for ``some nuances,'' he and the French
leader are in general agreement on the ``big questions'' of how to
react to the political upheaval sweeping Eastern Europe. He did not
elaborate.
   At a joint news conference that wrapped up their one-day
Caribbean retreat, Mitterrand expressed satisfaction with
U.S.-French relations. He said Secretary of State James A. Baker
III ``showed great understanding of the needs of Europe'' when he
pointed the way to a new role for NATO in a speech last week. Baker
suggested NATO oversee reductions of troops and armaments and take
news steps to build contacts with the East.
   At the same time, the French leader hinted broadly at
differences over the issue of German reunification with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Said Mitterrand, ``Mr. Kohl is a patriot and he obviously has
reflexes which are not mine.''
   Bush's voice was raspy from a cold and laryngitis as he and the
French president fielded questions after holding private talks on
this sun-splashed island in the West Indies.
   On another subject, Bush said he had no second thoughts about
his much-criticized decision to send two top aides to China last
weekend for the first high-level contact since Beijing brutally
crushed pro-democracy forces in Tiananmen Square.
   He said he ``already seen an indication, a couple of
indications'' of positive results from Chinese leaders, but did not
provide details.
   Bush also said he was ``delighted yesterday when the Colombian
government brought to bay the, I think the man who is ranked the
third most prominent narco-terrorist in Colombia, Mr. (Gonzalo
Rodriguez) Gacha.'' Gacha was shot to death in a gunfight with
Colombian police, but Bush did not directly refer to the man's
death.
   ``It was a very courageous effort on the part of the Colombians.
... I think we ought to salute them,'' he said.
   Bush and Mitterrand both said they had discussed the change in
Eastern Europe, where several hard-line Communist regimes have been
swept away in recent months with the encouragement of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush was asked if he would be willing to consider emergency food
aid for Eastern Germany, whose citizens are among millions in
Eastern Europe striving for greater freedoms after four decades of
communist rule.
   ``Obviously, if there's emergency food aid required there. We
have no request for that. But if it's required we would be very
responsive, and would like to think others in the alliance would
be,'' Bush said.
   Baker joined Bush for the talks at the end of his European trip,
which included a stop in East Germany for a meeting with the
reformist government leaders as well as opposition figures. His
trip to East Germany was designed to bolster the government as it
plans for elections in the spring.
   As for Eastern Europe, Bush said:
   ``We spent a lot of time talking about Eastern Europe and the
dynamic changes taking place there and inside the Soviet Union. And
I would simply not go into detail on this answer except to say I
feel very close to President Mitterrand's views here. ... There may
be some nuances of difference, but in terms of the big questions of
Eastern Europe, I feel reassured that President Mitterrand and I
are viewing these the same way.''
   One of the ``nuances'' appeared to touch on the thorny issue of
German reunification.
   Asked if the two men had an agreement to slow West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's vision of closer ties between East and
West Germany, Bush said, ``No.''
   Mitterrand said he had used an analogy in discussing European
changes with Bush: ``If the horses of the team don't move at the
same speed, there will be an accident,'' he said.
   Bush also dismissed the possibility of improved ties with Libya,
saying he had not seen ``hard evidence'' of a ``renunciation of
international terrorism.''
   Bush's decision to send National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Depury Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to
China last weekend provoked sharp criticism in the United States,
but the president said he had no second thoughts.
   He said each country needs to decide whether to maintain the
sanctions against Beijing that were implemented in the wake of last
June's crackdown, but that he would advise against lifting any
measures in place.
   Even so, the administration said several days ago it might lift
a ban on the export of three communications satellites that would
be launched by the Chinese.
   En route to St. Martin, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said both Bush and Mitterrand ``felt they needed a face-to-face
meeting to discuss some of the more personal and private sides of
the changes going on in Eastern Europe and their personal
impressions of Gorbachev and what's going on in the Soviet Union.''
   European leaders, at their meeting at Strasbourg last weekend,
endorsed the concept of a single Germany, but suggested a series of
conditions to ensure stability in Europe.
   The Strasbourg session, hosted by Mitterrand, also produced
statements praising Gorbachev's initiatives and hailing recent
changes in Eastern Europe.
   Mitterrand has been among European leaders urging that Soviet
concerns be taken into account when discussing the issue of German
unification. Bush, too, has urged a cautious approach, arguing
against setting a timetable and saying the eventual decision must
be acceptable to both East and West Germans.
   Despite their close relationship, France and the United States
still have some areas of disagreement.
   France, which has not been a member of NATO's military command
since 1966, has resisted the alliance's evolution into the
principal Western forum for dealing with changes in Eastern Europe.
   Regarding the sale of goods to Warsaw Pact nations that might
have military application, the United States has taken a more
cautious approach than Mitterrand or other European leaders have
advocated.
   The restrictions on such trade are policed by a Paris-based
organization called COCOM _ the Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls _ made up of NATO nations and Japan.
   Mitterrand also has endorsed Gorbachev's call for a 35-nation
conference next year to discuss changes in Eastern Europe. Bush has
not.

   A poll of East Germans commissioned
by West German media showed 71 percent of those surveyed oppose
German reunification, according to results available Saturday.
   The poll, conducted by two respected West German public opinion
research organizations, asked 1,032 East Germans of voting age in
early December about their political views.
   It was commissioned by the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel and
the ZDF television network.
   Spiegel reported in its latest edition, made available to news
agencies late Saturday, that only 27 percent of respondents said
they supported the building of a common German state, while 71
percent said they opposed it.
   The magazine did not specify the poll's margin of error or
provide other details.
   About half the respondents, asked who they would vote for in the
first free elections in East Germany set for May 6, 1990, said they
were not sure yet, Spiegel said.
   Another 12 percent said they support the Communists, 7 percent
said they would vote for the newly formed opposition Social
Democratic Party and 5 percent said they were behind Neues Forum,
the largest of the pro-reform movements.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow was reported to be the hands-down
winner in popularity among East German politicians, and West Berlin
Mayor Walter Momper and West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker were selected as the best-liked West Germans.
   Spiegel said the poll had a shortcoming in that 23 percent of
the respondents were Communist Party members, while less than 13
percent of the population belongs to the party.
   But it said the poll results were confirmed as representative by
the Emnid Institute of Bielefeld and by the Mannheim-based Election
Research Group.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Vaclav Havel
said Saturday he would serve as president only if Alexander Dubcek
gets a top government role, indicating the two may have agreed to
avoid a fight over the presidency.
   In a nationally televised speech, the once-banned playwright
said he would accept the presidency only temporarily until someone
can be elected for the five-year term by ``a freely elected new
Federal Assembly.''
   He said he would only serve if ``next to me, whatever his
official function may be, will be Alexander Dubcek ... I will not
allow any dark forces to put a wedge between me and him and
therefore between the Czechs and Slovaks.''
   Dubcek, leader of the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms, had been
considered Havel's main rival for the largely ceremonial post. The
vacancy was created a week ago when hard-line Communist Gustav
Husak resigned after swearing in the country's first non-Communist
dominated government since 1948.
   The new government came to power on a wave of democratic reform
triggered by mass protests in the capital and other cities in which
millions demanded political change. The Communists have ousted
hard-line leaders, surrendered their monopoly on power and allowed
free travel.
   Rumors circulating widely in Prague suggested that Dubcek,
expelled from the Communist Party in 1969 following the Soviet-led
invasion that crushed his reforms, had agreed to accept the
chairmanship of Parliament in exchange for supporting Havel.
   It was unclear whether Dubcek would support Havel or simply not
compete for president. Another presidential contender is Cestmir
Cisar, the candidate of the Czechoslovak Socialist Youth Union.
   Dubcek, on his way to a dinner Saturday given by visiting
Italian Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, said he and Havel had
``been together from the very start.''
   Leaders from Czechoslovakia's small Socialist and People's
parties joined Havel and Dubcek at the Italian Embassy.
   Opposition Civic Forum spokesman Petr Kucera, speaking at a news
conference earlier, said Havel and Dubcek had met Saturday, and
``both parties left assuming that agreement was reached for joint
action.''
   Kucera declined to say exactly when Dubcek, Havel and a close
circle of advisers met or provide details on what sort of action
was planned.
   Havel's speech directly addressed the Communist deputies who
dominate Czechoslovakia's Parliament and, under the constitution,
must elect a new head of state by Dec. 24.
   ``If they don't want to risk strikes, chaos and international
shame, I plead with them not to complicate the situation and not to
expose themselves to the danger of being condemned by the public,
but to understand the call of this moment,'' Havel said.
   ``Very soon, we should have someone suitable in the
(presidential) castle, preferably before the end of this year,'' he
said.
   Havel said the temporary president's role would be to guide the
country to free elections and oversee democratic reforms in the
totalitarian system that has kept Czechoslovakia in an iron grip
for four decades.
   The Communist-dominated Federal Assembly, Czechoslovakia's
parliament, is scheduled to meet Tuesday. Deputies arriving for the
session will be confronted by students demonstrating their support
for Havel, a symbol of Czechoslovakia's long battle for human
rights.
   Since the triumph of the pro-democracy movement over the old
Communist leadership in a brief three weeks, the ruling party has
been in disarray.
   On Thursday, the Communists backed out of an agreement reached
during intense negotiations the night before with the opposition
and representatives from four smaller parties.
   The failed accord called for extending the constitutional
deadline to allow elections in Parliament before the end of
January. It also called for the new president to be Czech and
unaffiliated with any party. Dubcek is a Slovak.
   Dubcek has been seen by some Communist deputies as the party's
last, best hope for keeping Havel out of office. He is the only
figure to hold an equal place in the heart of anti-Communist
Czechoslovaks and enjoys enormous popularity in his home republic
of Slovakia.
   Although expelled from the party for his reformist ideas, the
former Communist Party chief maintains his belief in socialism and
has said he would run if called by the people.
   Regional Civic Forum representatives meeting Saturday decided to
ask non-Communist members of Parliament to introduce a procedural
amendment Tuesday, calling for a public vote broadcast live instead
of the traditional secret balloting.
   The opposition has begun a letter-writing campaign to pressure
deputies to abide by the wishes of their constituencies and push
the date of the vote to the next parliamentary session.
   ``The most important thing is that people are tired of the
political tension,'' said Civic Forum spokesman Josef Vavrousek.
``We have a new government with an unusual composition, a
Parliament that is not trusted and no president. We need a
president to give our country stability.''
   The opposition is calling for the ``restructuring'' of
Parliament, meaning the removal of discredited, hard-line Communist
deputies. Civic Forum said 22 deputies have resigned and that
others are under enormous pressure to do so. The figure could not
be independently confirmed.
   However, petitions are circulating widely in the capital
demanding resignations.
   Excusing the confusion wrought by the stunning revolution,
Vavrousek called the election of the presidency ``the second stage
of a transition to a democratic state. The first stage was aimed at
the destruction of the totalitarian state.''
   ``You may have noticed it's not easy to go from a totalitarian
state to a democratic state in a democratic way.''

<HEAD>Underground Atlanta Doing A Booming Business Six Months After Opening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN S. CARLSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after opening, Underground is the new
mandatory stop on the Atlanta tour.
   Atlantans are bringing their relatives. Yuppies from around the
Southeast have integrated it into their weekend visits. Tourists
and conventioneers ask for directions to it as soon as they get to
town.
   ``I think it's kind of a tourist trap, but it's something your
out-of-town guests want to see,'' said Atlanta resident Mary Van
Ehrlich. ``You take them to the top of the Regency (Hotel), you
take them to Stone Mountain and now you take them to Underground
Atlanta. It's one of the expected stops.''
   Since the shopping and entertainment complex opened June 15, as
many as 7 million people have trekked to Underground, said general
manager William M. Coleman.
   Initial figres show only about 40 percent _ far less than the 70
percent projected _ are from outside metropolitan Atlanta, Coleman
said.
   The proportion of locals to out-of-towners, however, is expected
to drop during the traditional post-Christmas retail slump this
winter, which is also a time when Atlanta will have its biggest
conventions in town.
   But no matter where they are from, those who venture into
Underground _ created in old storefronts that were once the heart
of Atlanta before a network of bridges over the railroad tracks
literally raised downtown one level _ are spending an average of
$35 apiece, Coleman said.
   Gross sales volume for the 76 shops and pushcarts, about 22 food
court vendors and 17 restaurants and nightclubs reached about $36
million through November, about 20 percent above projections for
the Rouse Co. project. Rouse is the same company that developed
Boston's trendy Faneuil Hall shopping area and Baltimore's
Harborplace.
   ``It's very good. But December will tell the tale because it's
such an important month for retailers,'' Coleman said.
   Although none of the original shops has gone out of business,
three nightclubs already have filed for reorganization in federal
bankruptcy court _ a development Coleman attributed to management
problems and not sales volume.
   Some of the fast food vendors also have complained that their
sales have dropped since the summer boom, although other merchants
say they had expected a slump in September and October.
   ``I believe what is happening at Underground Atlanta is normal _
especially when many of the food operators there have little
experience,'' said retail analyst Neil Thall.
   ``I see nothing indicative of a general problem with
Underground. It takes a while for retailers at a large center like
this to shake down,'' said Thall, director of retail services with
Kurt Salmon Associates. ``Underground looks pretty healthy to me.''
   That's how it looks to Ken Piotrowski, owner of the Christmas
Factory, and Dante Stephensen, owner of Dante's Down The Hatch _
both veteran Georgia businessmen whose shops are doing considerably
better than they had expected.
   ``I'm doing 2{ times the business I expected,'' said Stephensen,
whose nightclub-restaurant was one of the most popular in the
original Underground Atlanta, a complex that closed in the
mid-1970s after a decline blamed on petty crimes and transit system
construction.
   Stephensen said he based his projections on graphs he kept
during the 11 years he operated in old Underground.
   ``Everything boomed in June, July and August. But we knew it
wouldn't continue,'' he said. ``But the figures have eased back
above projections for everyone, assuming people made good
projections.''
   Piotrowski has been surprised by the amount of money people are
willing to spend in Underground and at his shop, which features
imported Christmas tree ornaments and decorations.
   ``There are some very, very wealthy people walking around. We've
had people walk into the store and spend $2,000, no problem,'' he
said, adding that many of his customers are international tourists
and conventioneers.

<HEAD>Doctor: Marijuana Use Common Link Among Young Tumor Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marijuana smoking was the common link
among a number of otherwise healthy young people who developed
large, fast-growing cancerous tumors of the mouth and neck, two
doctors reported.
   ``This was a rather shocking finding,'' said Dr. Paul Donald, a
head and neck surgeon at the University of California-Davis, who
noticed the link in nine of his patients.
   The patients included one man with a tumor bulging from his
mouth to his chin, a woman with a tumor under her tongue and a man
with a huge mass on the side of his neck, Donald told a meeting of
immunologists in Clearwater on Friday.
   The surgeon said had seen such cancers before among people in
their 60s who had been heavy drinkers and cigarette smokers for
decades.
   But the patients he treated had an average age of 27. One was
just 19.
   All had smoked marijuana during high school or college, or
during a tour of duty in Vietnam. Some had smoked as few as two or
three marijuana cigarettes a week, others as many as six or eight a
day, he said.
   The tumors in most cases were huge and fast growing, Donald
said, adding that he had to remove the jaws of several patients.
Some lost part or all of their tongue.
   One patient who smoked marijuana heavily in Vietnam died, but so
far the others are doing well, he said.
   Donald said he cannot prove that marijuana is the culprit in
these cases. But if it's not, he said, it's quite a coincidence.
   Sharing his concern was Dr. James Endicott, chairman of
otolaryngology at the University of South Florida in Tampa.
   Although there is no conclusive evidence that marijuana caused
the tumors, ``there's something seriously wrong here,'' Endicott
said.
   ``It's a phenomenon,'' he said, ``and it's scary.''
   Some of the cases he and Donald have collected go back to the
mid-1970s. Endicott said he polled doctors in the Tampa area and
found about 50 patients under 40 with fast-growing head and neck
tumors. All of those interviewed so far said they had smoked
marijuana, he said.
   Endicott has seen about two dozen of the patients, including a
31-year-old woman who developed larynx cancer at 17 after smoking
marijuana for two years. She had a recurrence a couple of years ago
but seems to be recovering, he said.
   A university research team is doing laboratory studies on
patients' tumor cells as part of a study that seeks to establish a
cause of the cancers.

   Here is a transcript of the news
conference held Saturday by U.S. President George Bush and French
President Francois Mitterrand. Mitterrand spoke through an
interpreter.
   MITTERRAND: Ladies and gentlemen, we have just completed our
political conversation, and we have spoken for several hours of
those subjects which seem most important, given the turn of events
in the world. You already have the lists, I can imagine, just in
your own mind.
   First of all, the evolution of Europe and naturally, Eastern
Europe, and particularly, Eastern Germany, without forgetting
others.
   Recent meetings with Mr. Gorbachev, the conclusions or what we
could infer from these conversations, enable us to compare point of
views and our impressions. And _ I'm waiting for the sound to be
completely adjusted. Can you hear? (Laughter.)
   And at the same time, we dealt with all the subjects connected
to the conference on their forms of disarmament and the forms of
assistance, name of the banks, vis-a-vis, eastern countries.
   And _ moving from this major problem, we dealt with it on other
matters, such as Lebanon, for instance. And we considered the
evolution of mind or attitudes, vis-a-vis of problems arising for
peace; and the various pressing statements of the Secretary of
State, Mr. Baker _ what we both thought about it and what could be
done to take into account the rapid evolution of events and
situations. It would be ridiculous to let themselves be superceded
by events, and at the same time, one needs to assess them.
   Things move fast. They moved very fast in these past few weeks,
and they might move very fast in the coming weeks. And let us
seriously consider what is going on from day to day without losing
sight of a desirable perspective. Well, this is a list. It's a pure
description, what I'm doing here, as I would like, to the
journalists who came to St. Martin _ I would like to leave it up to
you to stress those points you're most interested in.
   But, first of all, I would like to say how very pleased I was to
be able to receive President George Bush. It's a very great
pleasure and a very great honor for our country, as we are here _
here at home in French land, and they're our neighbor and friend _
a personal friend as well _ came to talk with us, and to talk about
the experience required during these difficult days, our feelings
and our values.
   And I must say that from most point of views, we reached a
harmony of views and were able to develop a policy, a common
policy, not only amongst ourselves, but with others. And therefore,
I would like to repeat here how very pleased we were in St. Martin
to be able to receive George Bush, not only because as the
President, but also because of the people he represents. And it
occurred very informally, as you see, as it always does. I felt,
somewhat the same atmosphere of _ we had in Kennebunkport in the
home of George Bush, and it continued exactly in the same spirit.
And I would very much like this to go on for a long time. Thank you.
   BUSH: Thank you, Mr. President. Let me simply thank you for your
hospitality, everyone else in St. Martin. And to say that, as with
our earlier talks, not just in Maine, but in Paris at the time of
that glorious celebration, off in the corner at NATO, I learned a
lot. I can say to this distinguished group that I feel that France
and the United States, regarding these dynamic changes that are
taking place, are very close together. And I would also add that I
think it is very important that France and the United States be
close together as we discuss the changes that are taking place.
   So, sir, thank you very much for your warm hospitality. I have
only one complaint _ put it this way, one regret, and that is that
we have to leave this beautiful paradise on such a short time
schedule. But you were wonderful to come all this way, and from the
American side, my sincerest thanks to you, sir.
   MITTERRAND: Well, a lot of people are asking for the floor.
First of all, as we're in France here, American journalists
therefore. Obviously, I can't recognize you. Yes, sir?
   Q: For both presidents. I understand that one area of
disagreement between the both of you was on the subject of export
controls on highly sensitive goods shipped into Eastern Europe, the
so-called COCOM regulations. President Bush, I wonder if at this
point, since you're making overtures in other areas, you feel it's
time to relax these regulations? And also if President Mitterrand
would respond, too, if you and the United States are in more
agreement today on this than you were before the meeting?
   BUSH: One, I did not have a discussion with the President of
France on that subject. Two, we should and will review our COCOM _
our participation in COCOM, our discussions in COCOM. There are
certainly still legitimate national security interests that must be
preserved, and I don't think we have one iota of difference with
France on that. But I think it is timely that we take a new look at
some of the commercial constraints.

<HEAD>Committee Rejects Resolutions Promoting Christianity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three resolutions promoting Christianity were
rejected by a committee of the Arizona Republican Party on
Saturday, raising the threat of a floor fight at the GOP's state
convention next month.
   The resolutions were among nine submitted to the party's
resolutions committee in advance of the Jan. 27 convention. All
nine were rejected.
   Republicans from Pinal County south of Phoenix, who drafted a
``Christian nation'' resolution passed at the party's last state
convention, submitted resolutions this year promoting diligent
Bible study, restoration of ``Christian prayer'' in public schools
and recognition of the United States' ``Christian heritage.''
   Anetta Conant, who was representing Pinal County, cast the only
votes in favor of the resolutions, which were rejected by 30-1
votes.
   Ms. Conant said she was not surprised by the defeat. ``I
expected it,'' she said.
   She said she expected all three resolutions to be introduced
from the floor during the state convention, but was not hopeful
they would be passed because many delegates who believed in them
would not have the courage ``to vote their convictions.''
   Pinal County delegates won passage of a resolution declaring the
United States a ``Christian nation'' during last January's state
convention. The measure was introduced from the floor after many
delegates already had left the meeting.
   State Republican Chairman Burton Kruglick, who is Jewish,
engineered passage of another resolution five weeks later,
attacking those who promote ``racism, anti-Semitism or religious
intolerance.''
   Kruglick wrote members of the resolutions committee before
Saturday's meeting, urging rejection of the new resolutions.
   ``The message sent by these three resolutions is one of
exclusion and a clear disregard for those of other than Christian
faith,'' Kruglick wrote.
   Dean Cooley of Phoenix, co-chairman of the resolutions
committee, said steps have been taken to keep surprise resolutions
from being passed at the Jan. 27 state convention.
   ``We have a new rule that a copy of each resolution will have to
be in the hands of each person before a vote is taken,'' he said.
   The resolutions committee also unanimously rejected a measure
supporting ``the constitutional principle of separation of church
and state.''
   Kurt Davis, the state party's executive director, said the
committee decided that issue is dealt with adequately in the
national Republican platform.
   Other resolutions rejected by the committee supported
floridation of water supplies, establishment of a national
presidential primary and protection of employees from mandatory
polygraph tests.

<TEXT>ST. MARTIN: commercial constraints.    Q: Could I follow that up,
sir? When you were in Malta, you promised President Gorbachev certain economic
concessions, including observer status in GATT?.    In the last couple
of days the Congress of Peoples' Deputies has seen them move away some
of the perestroika reforms of President Gorbachev. Were the things that
you promised contingent on certain things happening in the Soviet Union?
   BUSH: Well, there are certain things happening in the world, certain
things happening in terms of the necessary steps that'd be taken inside
the Soviet Union. But I would not say _ I would not say that I've seen
anything in the last couple of days that negates my hopes for doing business
with the Soviet Union along the lines President Gorbachev and I talked
about.    MITTERRAND: I'll answer along the same lines. Yes, the situation
changing. It is normal for our regulations to become more flexible, to
which extent _ at which rate it would feel this is still something which
has to be resolved by technical diplomatic discussion amongst ourselves.
Yes, madame?    Q. (inaudible) Wednesday in Paris. What achievement you
would like to see out of this dialogue? And if I may ask, President Bush,
are you hopeful for a dialogue, Israeli-Palestinian?    MITTERRAND: Well,
that was not at all the center of our conversations, although this is a
very important subject. We couldn't talk about everything. And I must say
that we talked about the Near East. We dwelled on Lebanon.    Well, obviously
we discussed Israel, but Israel vis-a-vis the Arab countries was not raised
in sufficient, clear way for me to be able to give you anything new. So
let's talk about Lebanon, if you like.    For Lebanon we recalled our
positions, which I myself expressed on French television to give the opinion
of my country _ for the opinion of my country, rather. And I said that
we had supported the Paris Agreements, and we recognized the various elements,
the implementation of these agreements as from the moment the Lebanese
parliamentarians accepted them and elected a president of the republic,
and then another one who appointed a government.    So it is a legitimate
government _ a legitimate situation which can be justified only in seeking
a dialogue and civilian peace amongst Lebanese which must therefore exclude
any foreign intervention. But, it is legitimate, and I express this view
in writing at various times to General Aoun.    We French feel very close
to all Lebanese, and particularly to those who feel threatened, and it's
not always the same at the same time.    But we do think that the best
guarantee for all is the law, the situation of legitimate constitutional
order, and we believe that it would be wise for everybody to recognize
this supreme law.    In any case, such is the position of France. I discussed
this with President Bush, and I don't think that we were in any disagreement
on the subject.    BUSH: No, and your question that you directed to me
_ yes, that's what the Baker points _ five points are about.   
That's what Mr. Mubarak was attempting to do to get dialogue and discussion
going on the West Bank which would include Palestinians. So, we are for
that, and I'm hopeful that the meetings that Secretary Baker will be having
after the first of the year with the foreign ministers will move that peace
process forward. We are committed to it.    MITTERRAND: It will be easy
for me to add my own opinion, very briefly _ we can't and you can't solve
the problem of the Palestinians without the Palestinians. Yes, sir?  
 Q. (inaudible) because I think there is a problem between Libya and France,
and also there is a problem between America and Libya, so do you have a
shared point of view on your relations with Libya?    MITTERRAND: Are
you putting the question to me?    Yes, very well. So _ our relations
with Libya have been fairly complicated. Well, first of all, there was
the war in Chad. And we supported these forces of the legitimate Chaddian
leaders so as to reconquer their independence, their sovereignty,
and the unity of their country, which meant that we countered the ambition
of Libya, which indeed created a rather difficult atmosphere.    But this
war was won by the Chaddians. This country has become what we expected
of it, free and sovereign, and it will regain its unity, and therefore
we consider that our actions fulfilled this objective, but it took five
years' patience and struggle, but it is done now. At the same time, a bone
of contention was disappearing with Libya at the same time. And if obviously
this country had feelings of revenge vis-a-vis Chad, they would find themselves
in exactly the same situation vis-a-vis us.    Other events have occurred
which touch the United States of America more. I do not think that it's
up to me to discuss this subject. One can only hope to see countries of
Magreb and North Africa prefer the ways of peace and the refusal of terrorism
to the means of war or international disorder. And it is along these lines
that our diplomacy continues to have a dialogue with ups and downs with
the Libyan leaders.    And I express the hope, why shouldn't this come
to an end, obviously in respecting the rights of people?

<HEAD>Complaints Start Even Before Mandatory Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mandatory water restrictions
haven't started yet in drought-parched South Florida, but
complaints have.
   Environmentalists charge sensitive wildlife in the drying
Everglades are being shortchanged, and golf course operators worry
that the winter tourist trade may wither along with their greens.
   The South Florida Water Management District adopted mandatory
limits Thursday on lawn watering and home car washing for 4 million
people from Key West through Miami and Fort Lauderdale to Palm
Beach County to combat the worst drought in 27 years.
   Some parts of the southeast coast are 33 inches below normal
rainfall levels for the last 14 months heading into the dry season,
which runs through May.
   The restrictions take effect Monday, and the grumbling has
already started.
   ``In times of water shortage, wildlife interests suffer first
and benefit last,'' said Paul Parks of the Florida Wildlife
Federation. ``We don't have a true water allocation system that
actually shares adversity.''
   District policy says all water users must share the pain of
water cutbacks.
   Nevertheless, Rosa Durando of the Audubon Society of the
Everglades is upset that half of the 6.1 billion gallons of water
diverted in November from the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge
was shifted to sugar cane and vegetable farms. The other half went
into storage at Lake Okeechobee, a primary drinking water source.
   ``What crop that's grown in America, other than sugar, has a
guarantee first and above anybody else against the vagaries of
nature?'' she said.
   But Ed Barber of the Florida Sugar Cane League said the
diversion was ``a drop in the bucket'' that amounted to only a
three-week water supply at rationed levels.
   ``Everybody's going to get hit hard,'' Barber said. ``Frankly,
it is such a serious situation that we're not placing blame on
anyone.''
   Meanwhile, golf course operators are concerned about the
implications of the cutbacks for their business, a $5 billion a
year business in the Sunshine State.
   A complex set of rules allows the watering of greens only at
night and different irrigation times for the front nine and the
back nine on 18-hole courses.
   District officials say golf courses are among the biggest water
users, consuming 250,000 to 1 million gallons a night. An average
household uses only about 250 gallons a day.
   ``The aesthetics are going to suffer,'' said Steve Kuhn, greens
superintendent at Miami's famous Doral Country Club. ``Things won't
be as lush.''
   Heavily used public courses fear the worst with the new rules.
   ``We're not going to be able to keep up,'' said Carlos McKeon,
superintendent of the Dade County-owned Palmetto Golf Course in
suburban Miami. ``It's possible our fairways could just dry up, die
and get infested with weeds.''

<TEXT>ST. MARTIN: of people?     It's very important, as well,
to be aware of the importance of the CFCE conference on measures of security
which must be decided by the European countries, plus United States and
Canada.    A whole series of these proposals go exactly along _ I mean,
but our views _ we think that the very future of Eastern Europe is conditioned
by the way Eastern countries organize themselves, structure themselves,
coordinate their efforts, and endow themselves with common source.   
I often made this comparison _ including with President Bush _ if the horses
of the team don't move at the same speed, there will be an accident. And
we have to deal with the German problem, in particular and that of Eastern
Europe at a pace which must be harmonious. It must be in step with that
of European construction.    And I must say that Mr. Baker's statement
on the subject seemed to show great understanding of the needs of Europe.
   Afterwards, there was the part that had to do with the evolution of
the alliance and the content of NATO. Well, this is a subject to
be discussed.    We do not refuse. When a situation changes, the content
of alliances may change. And we belong to this alliance, although we have
a special status within it. We are fully aware of our obligations as allies,
as others must have as well in the same way.    So, now, this subject
is under study. The ideas were launched before the world public opinion,
particularly Europe, and I have not yet met with my European partners since
this major statement.    But, I agree on one point _ we cannot stay where
we were before the collapse of all the walls that existed between the peoples
of Europe, and likewise, the concept of antagonists of enemies. A possible
conflict no longer arises in the same terms, or at least I hope. But, we
need, as the President George Bush was saying before, we need to know and
observe the evolution of the forthcoming months, which remains uncertain
and which needs some time to rest, so as to enable us to see exactly what
is going on.    At the present time, we see the major trends, and one
can plan those perspectives, but we need this now to be completed before
drawing any diplomatic and military consequences.

   A World War II veteran Saturday criticized the
Army's investigation into his claims that he singlehandledly killed
more than 500 Japanese soldiers.
   The Army said it won't give the Medal of Honor to David Rubitsky
because it could not prove his claims.
   ``I'll admit that I am 72 years old and maybe I don't think with
a full head, but when I talked with the investigators, I began to
think that maybe they didn't think with a full head,'' Rubitsky
said.
   Rubitsky said he would continue his fight for the medal, which
he contends he was denied because he is Jewish.
   ``Being Jewish has a lot to do with it,'' he said. ``You have to
be Jewish to understand it.''
   Rubitsky, who lives in Milton 40 miles southwest of Milwaukee,
appeared at a news conference with Joseph Stehling, a retired
brigadier general who has signed an affidavit supporting Rubitsky's
claims.
   Rubitsky claims that he killed up to 600 Japanese in the New
Guinea jungle during a 21-hour siege in early December 1942.
   Stehling signed an affidavit saying he inspected the battle
scene and there were more than 500 Japanese wounded or killed by
Rubitsky's actions.
   ``I saw the dead bodies _ lots of them,'' Stehling said
Saturday. ``I'm frustrated a little bit because they don't believe
me.''
   Retired Gen. Herbert Smith, who died in September, signed a
similar affidavit. Another affidavit in the case, signed by a
military messenger, said a colonel, now dead, had denied Rubitsky
his medal because Rubitsky was Jewish.
   Lt. Col. Terry Adkins, chief of the Army's Military Awards
Branch that made the decision, said Friday the Army could not even
prove fierce fighting occured during the period.
   Adkins said the Army examined scores of documents, including
testimony from Japanese prisoners of war, battle logs and
interviews.
   Rubitsky said the decision implied he, Stehling and Smith, were
liars.
   ``They're not only calling me a liar. These men saw what
happened. They said they saw it; they signed the affidavits,''
Rubitsky said.
   Rubitsky told reporters he has spent $16,000 since he began his
fight for the medal in 1986, including the money he spent to travel
to Washington to present his case.
   ``I wouldn't have spent $16,000 if I was lying about
something,'' he said.
   Rubitsky said he doesn't know if there is an appeal proccess,
but said he intends to pursue the matter.
   Rubitsky said he began seeking the medal in 1986 after a reunion
of the 128th Regiment, when it was learned that he had never been
recommended for the medal.
   ``The medal never entered my mind,'' he said. ``I wanted to
forget the horrible things that happened out there.''

   BUSH: May I _ may I just add one word, Mr. President? We've
spent a lot of time talking about Eastern Europe, on the dynamic
changes taking place there and inside the Soviet Union. And I would
simply not go into detail on this answer except to say that I feel
very close to President Mitterrand's views here.
   Secretary Baker had a chance to go over these matters with
Roland Dumas, and I think there is _ there may be some nuances of
difference. But, in terms of the big questions of Eastern Europe, I
feel _ I would say simply reassured that President Mitterrand and I
are viewing these the same way.
   Mr. President, would it be all right to take under the policy of
dual recognition the man that thought he had been recognized here?
(Laughter.)
   Q: Thank you. Well, my question is to President Mitterand.
   (Laughter.) So, during your visit to South America, President
Perez of Venezuela suggested holding an international conference on
Haiti, and I would like to know whether you discussed it with
President Bush and if so, did he agree?
   MITTERRAND: We did not at all discuss this, as you think. But
this is an important subject and, which might come up in our next
exchange of correspondence, and I am sure we'll have many of those
in 1990.
   Q: Do you fear an increase of terrorist attacks either blind or
striking American interests in Europe, and did you evoke any reason
_ the reasons for better protecting ourselves against terrorism?
   MITTERRAND: Well, quite a lot of information seems to show that
there might be some awakening, reawakening of terrorists' intents,
particularly in some regions of the Near East. But from there to
actually go on to the act and even specify the intention, I mean,
there may be a great distance and I cannot prejudge this. I really
don't know. The duty of states is to protect ourselves against
terrorism, and nothing can be done which might weaken the moral,
psychological, and practical defense of police and security against
such danger. From this point of view, as many others, we have had
relations of work and trust with the U.S. and we shall continue.
   BUSH: We add to that that the cooperation has been superb and I
was delighted yesterday _ this was not discussed today _ but
delighted yesterday when the Colombian government brought to bay
the, I think the man who is ranked as the third most prominent
narco-terrorist in Colombia, Mr. Gacha. And that was a very
courageous, courageous effort on the part of the Colombians.
   And we have all different kinds of terrorists. This
narco-terrorism is simply outrageous and unacceptable, and when you
see a president of a battled country, and Colombia fits that
description, doing its level best to bring them to justice, I think
we ought to all salute him.
   Q: (inaudible) on East Germany, do you have any specific
prescriptions to keep the situation from running wild? Apparently
it's quite different from what was going on in Poland and Hungary.
Mr. President, perhaps some instant food aid as winter approaches?
Is there some special way to treat the East German chaotic
situation?
   BUSH: I don't know there's a special way, but we spelled out at
NATO the four points that relate to German reunification _ the
Strasbourg declaration under the meeting headed by President
Mitterrand addressed themselves to that question.
   Obviously, if there's emergency food aid required there _ we
have no request for that _ but if it's required, we would be very
responsive, as I expect others in the Alliance would be.
   Q: Mr. President _ President Bush, do you now have a special
relationship with the French government and President Mitterrand
that rivals the supposed special relationship with the government
of Mrs. Thatcher, and can you discuss that for us?
   (Some audience laughter)
   BUSH: Well, put it this way, there's not supposed to be any
rivalry of this nature. We have a special relationship with the
United Kingdom. I think everybody knows it. I'd like to think I
have a very special relationship with President Mitterrand, and I
can tell you that the ability to pick up the phone, no matter what
the subject is, as I have done on occasions and he has done on
occasions and have honest exchanges of information, has been
extraordinarily helpful I think to both sides. I can speak for the
U.S. So I hope it is a special relationship, but perhaps I ought to
let the President of the Republic speak to that.
   MITTERRAND: Well, I mean _ we're not sometimes sentimental
competition. I mean, there is room enough for several friendships
in life. I don't see why without necessarily moving to excess _ I
mean, you know the poet who wrote of the enumerable heart _ well,
not enumerable, but one may have one's heart open to several
friendships (audience laughs).

<HEAD>Memo Shows That Shultz Backed 1985 Plan for Honduras Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recently unearthed State Department memo
shows that former Secretary of State George P. Shultz approved a
1985 White House plan to expedite U.S. assistance to Honduras ``to
encourage the Hondurans to remain firm in their support'' of the
Nicaraguan contras.
   Congressional officials regard the document as further proof of
a ``quid pro quo'' to expedite U.S. aid to Honduras in return for
that country's support for the contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's
leftist government, a source said Saturday. At the time, Congress
had banned military aid to the contras.
   They believe it also shows that Shultz knew about the
arrangement, contrary to his statements to Congress, the source
said.
   The key document, a Feb. 7, 1985, memo from former assistant
secretary Langhorne A. Motley to Shultz, was turned up in a new
search related to the Iran-contra trial of former national security
adviser John Poindexter.
   The classified document, now declassified, was sent to several
congressional committees on Dec. 5 with an explanation that it had
not been turned up in earlier searches because of a computer
matching problem.
   The committee also received memos dated Feb. 13 and Feb. 19
offering progress reports on the plan. One of those describes
efforts to move forward with a $35 million installment of U.S.
foreign aid to Honduras and fulfillment of the ``quid pro quo''
deal.
   ``It's very telling,'' said one congressional source.
   As initially reported by The Washington Post, Motley's memo
describes a White House meeting in which officials agreed on a
course of action to bolster Honduran support of the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   ``It was agreed,'' said the document, initialled by Shultz as
his sign of approval, ``that some combination of efforts was needed
to encourage the Hondurans to remain firm ...''
   It went on to spell out a plan for expedited economic and
military aid to Honduras, including an envisioned letter from
then-President Reagan to Roberto Suazo Cordova, then president of
Honduras. ``Although the president's letter would not be explicitly
linked to the specific reassuring actions listed above, our
intentions and expectations would be made clear in an oral demarche
(presentation),'' the Motley memo said.
   The plan, ultimately approved by Reagan, also contemplated other
meetings with Suazo, including one by then-Vice President Bush.
   Questions were raised during the Iran-contra trial of
Poindexter's deputy, Oliver North, as to whether Bush, in his March
16, 1985 meeting with Suazo, had delivered a secret arrangement for
helping the contras through Honduras.
   Bush told reporters on May 4 there was no such discussion.
``Honduras _ there was no quid pro quo., Everybody that attended
the meeting says there was no quid pro quo. ... The word of the
president of the United States, George Bush, is there was no quid
pro quo.''
   Shultz, who was said by his office to be traveling and
unavailable for comment, has repeatedly told Congress that he was
opposed to conditioning U.S. aid to Honduras on its support of the
contras, and that his view prevailed.
   Motley told the Post that the document actually supports prior
contentions there was no such deal. He acknowledged that U.S.
officials informed Honduras about their concerns for the contras,
and in turn entertained Honduran requests for expedited assistance.
But that, he said, did not constitute a quid pro quo because no
American ever offered to ``trade A for B.''
   Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations, said the discovery of the
Motley memo ``illustrates the correctness of our continuing to
pursue the Iran-contra affair. It also illustrates why there is
such continuing suspicion on the part of Congress of how much of
the truth we are getting.''
   Poindexter, who headed the Feb. 7, 1985 meeting described by
Motley, faces five felony charges for his role in the Iran-contra
affair.

   The Communist Party changed its name Saturday
and appealed to reform-minded members to set a new course for the
discredited party.
   At a closed session of an emergency congress, more than 2,700
delegates decided to change the party's official name from the
Socialist Unity Party of Germany to the Socialist Unity Party of
Germany-Party of Democratic Socialism.
   The congress also was expected to adopt a more democratic
platform before it completes its session on Sunday.
   The Communists have been under increasing pressure from mass
demonstrations demanding democratic reforms and in the past two
months have ousted hard-line leaders, opened borders and promised
free elections.
   The Communists will face challenges when parliamentary elections
are held May 6, and one smaller political party and an opposition
group also met Saturday to discuss their goals and strategy for
attracting support.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe on Saturday:
   _ Czechoslovakia's opposition movement demanded immediate
presidential elections be held by Parliament, suggesting the
leading contenders _ Alexander Dubcek and opposition leader Vaclav
Havel _ had reached an accord on who should have the post. Ex-party
leader Dubcek's ``Prague Spring'' reforms were crushed by a
Soviet-led invasion in 1968.
   Havel offered another indication that an arrangement had been
reached when he said later he would serve as president only if
Dubcek is given a top role in the government.
   _ Several thousand protesters in Sofia, Bulgaria, demanded an
official funeral service for the victims of Stalinist purges,
including a Communist Party chief who was hanged after a show trial
40 years ago.
   _ Solidarity leader Lech Walesa led a group of about 1,000
people in Gdansk, Poland, in marking the anniversary of the killing
of scores of Baltic Coast workers by Communist security forces
during food riots in December 1970.
   _ In a related development, President Bush said the United
States would be ``very responsive'' to any request from East
Germany for emergency wintertime food aid. He made the comment at a
joint news conference with French President Francois Mitterrand
following their brief summit conference on the Caribbean island of
St. Martin.
   The East German Communist congress gave party leader Gregor Gysi
a standing ovation when he announced the party's new name.
   ``We want to be a party that is thoroughly reformed ... and
therefore a new name,'' Communist Premier Hans Modrow told
reporters.
   The delegates also burst into thunderous applause when Michael
Schumann, addressing a party report on corruption, accused ousted
hard-line leader Erich Honecker of ignoring public desire for
reform.
   The ailing Honecker, in a letter sent to the party leadership
nearly a month ago and released to the delegates Saturday, conceded
he had ``deceived'' himself about the state of the economy and the
mood of the people. But he rejected widespread accusations that he
was corrupt.
   The corruption report blamed Honecker, 77, and former economics
chief Guenter Mittag for what it called political and economic
errors that led to the successful pro-democracy movement and the
decline of Communist power.
   The party has given up its constitutional mandate to rule, and
more than 700,000 members have quit in recent weeks, dropping
membership to about 1.6 million.
   Honecker had to be replaced as party leader, the report said, to
prevent ``a civil war-like bloody conflict'' with pro-democracy
activists.
   It said the party should carry no ``collective guilt'' for
wrongdoing by disgraced former leaders, but criticized members for
failing to stand up to the corrupt party hierarchy.
   Honecker has been in seclusion since he was stripped of his
party leadership posts on Oct. 18. He was expelled from the party
on Dec. 3 for suspected corruption and put under house arrest two
days later.
   Kurt Hager, the former party ideologist, told reporters at the
congress he ``felt guilty,'' but that the errors of the past were a
``collective responsbility.''
   Honecker is ``very sick, but it's another question about what is
going to happen to him. ... The party leadership will be judged,
but you have to prove the guilt of individuals,'' Hager said.
   A guest at the congress was Rudolf Bahro was a former party
member arrested for his critical views of orthodox communism and
expelled to West Germany in the 1970s. He recently returned to East
Germany.
   Bahro, a 54-year-old intellectual, told reporters that the
Communist Party's reform effort was ``half-hearted,'' and that the
party must establish new ties to the population to gain support.
   Several speakers said the party would have to start its campaign
early if it were to have a chance in the May elections.
   Meanwhile, the Christian Democratic Union, one of the small
political parties formerly aligned with the Communists, completed
its own congress Saturday and elected reformer Lothar de Maiziere,
49, to lead it.
   The party plans to emphasize its religious roots to gain support
from East Germans, the majority of whom are believers.
   Democratic Awakening, one of the better-known reform movements,
opened a founding conference in Leipzig and outlined its political
course for the May elections.
   The fledgling opposition group said a German confederation
``within a European peace order'' was the main aim of its platform.
   It was not clear if Democratic Awakening supports reunification
of the Germanys or only close cooperation between the nations. It
has drifted away from most of the other reform movements _
including New Forum _ that say East Germany should remain a
sovereign state.
   The Communist leadership also opposes reunification.
   Also Saturday, a regional newspaper reported that the nation's
secret police force once had planned a detention camp for
``counterrevolutionaries.''
   The report in the paper Thueringische Landeszeitung quoted an
unidentified army major as saying the plans were discovered during

<HEAD>ST. MARTIN: several friendships.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   (MITTERRAND): And then _ to classify isn't easy. They're also
very French _ a very interesting thing that's called the map of
love _ well, to you journalists _ well just _ the map of love in
French is up to you to decipher this map. It's not mine. But, what
I do certainly hope is that we keep very close friendship with the
United States of America as we shall have with the United Kingdom..
   Q: (Would you have) given that answer before January 20th, 1989?
   MITTERRAND: Before the 20th of January? What happened on the
20th of January? (Laughter) You seem to remember my own feelings
more than I do myself. I would have said _ even before Mr. Bush's
election, is that what you mean? I mean from what I am able to
deduce? Because you need a triple translation to get to your
meaning. I got a long very well with Mr. Reagan, and now that he's
no longer President of the United States of America, and I would
want to say anything that might seem slight or restrictive, that's
the way history was, and now with Mr. Bush we are working together,
and I think in a very good, close understanding. But to say more on
what you're interested in, sir, that is _ well _ just kind of
sentimental press. I'm certainly not going to say any more.
   Yes, sir.
   Q: President Bush, General Noriega of Panama, who has long been
a thorn in the side of the United States, has just this week
declared war on the United States. How do you respond to this last
outrage of General Noriega?
   BUSH: Well, I don't respond to it. I notice that he was made
supreme leader, or something of that nature. It has not changed our
view of him at all. He is a narcotics _ an indicted narcotics
dealer. And he ought to get out. And the minute he got out, the
relations between Panama and the United States would improve
dramatically.
   And not only is he a narcotics _ indicted narcotics dealer, but
he singlehandedly aborted the free will of the Panamian people _
the will being expressed in open and free elections. And Mr.
Noriega singlehandedly sent out his dignity battalions to beat up
the elected vice president and to keep the will of the people from
being fulfilled. And that is unacceptable as we see the world _
particularly in these times when we see the world moving more and
more towards democratic change.

   (Bush): Monsieur.
   Q: President Mitterrand, I'd like to ask you if you discussed in
any way China, and what you think of President Bush's decision to
send his envoys to China recently? And if I could follow on that,
Mr. Bush, if perhaps you've had second thoughts about the nature in
which this was done,in the secretive fashion, and in the toasting
of the Chinese while your envoys were there?
   MITTERRAND: Thank you for this question. Well, I should have
said in my presentation, indeed we did talk about China, and this
was at the initiative of President Bush, who himself expressed the
wish of being able to give us his views on this subject and the
reason for what was done. So, I think now you might hear this.
   BUSH: I have no second thoughts at all. And being somewhat
familiar with China, I've learned that you listen to everything
that's said in a toast. We've looked at every word and analyzed it,
and I'm strongly supportive of this mission by General Scowcroft
and Larry Eagleburger. I've said that I initiated it and I'm not
going to go further, except to say that I hope that it will have
positive results.
   And we've already seen an indication _ a couple of indications
of that, but I think, knowing China, again, I think time is
required. But _ this is a billion plus people, and I do not want to
hurt the billion plus people further. And I think we've made the
right step and only time will tell how this leadership in China
views the mission.
   
   Q: Is there any agreement between France and the U.S. to slow
down Mr. Kohl in his drive toward reunification? (Laughter.)
   MITTERRAND: I have your answer. Is there an agreement or
conformity of view to slow down?
   Yes, there's a great conformity of views _ particilarly to slow
down the _ as to _ considering slowing down Mr. Kohl, that's a
specific matter.
   But we think that everything as was said in Strasbourg is to be
done in the respect of treaties and the principles of Helsinki.
   And that at present there are two states. And if the evolution
seems to strengthen and hasten, it would be a good thing for the
German authority to contribute at the same time, to give up the
construction which is indispensable for the new European political
order, community, etc.
   Chancellor Kohl was telling me this yesterday as we were
together in Switzerland and he says it constantly; and there is no
reason to doubt this.
   That I did not set any timetable to the aspiration which is that
of all Germans and particular mind towards reunification. Therefore
I am not precipitating events even though I do hope for this. This
is what Mr. Kohl said.
   In any case, he is to conform with the treaties and agreements
which preside today to the European balance. And therefore I don't
have any particular complaints. Chancellor Kohl is _ Germany _ he's
a German patriot and he obviously has reflections which are not
mine.
   But the main thing, when we are together and when we speak as
responsible for our own countries, we sketch an outline which we
can agree, and in any case, I shall be meeting with Chancellor Kohl
on the fourth of January. And next, he shall be coming to see me in
France.
   Yes, sir?
   
   Q: Mr. Bush about China, do you believe that other countries
that follow the United States' lead on sanctions should now relieve
those sanctions to lighten them? And how would you feel if they did
that against your wishes?
   BUSH: I think each country has got to make its own
determination, but I think basically, if I had to answer yes or no,
I'd say _ I'd say no. I think they've got to wait and see how
matters evolve. That's what we're doing, and I think it's prudent.
   And for those who suggested that I have normalized relations
with this power because of one visit, they simply are wrong _ off
the reservation on that. So I think that's a matter for other
countries to determine.

<TEXT>
   Backers of the new civilian
president-elect clashed with police after victory celebrations
across the country, leaving one person dead and dozens injured,
authorities said Saturday.
   At least 870 people were reported arrested.
   Police said a woman was killed during demonstrations in Temuco,
540 miles south of Santiago. They gave no details, but the official
Orbe news agency said she was killed ``when demonstrators altered
the public order, damaging public properties, and forced police to
act.''
   Thousands of supporters of opposition leader Patricio Aylwin
took to the streets Friday night to celebrate his victory in the
presidential election the day before and an end to military rule.
Police reported disorders in many cities throughout the country but
said the situation calmed down early Saturday.
   They said 589 demonstrators were arrested in Santiago, where
dozens of people were injured, including 20 police officers hit by
rocks. Police arrested 281 people in the resort city of Vina del
Mar, according to officials.
   The violence broke out in Santiago when police started
dispersing people who tried to march in off-limit areas, including
streets next to the presidential palace and Defense Ministry.
Police charged the crowds after some demonstrators began throwing
rocks at them and also at traffic signals and public buses.
   Police had used water cannons and tear gas Thursday to scatter
more than 100 demonstrators in Santiago who were demanding the
immediate release of imprisoned leftists, including some accused of
terrorism and guerrilla activities.
   Aylwin, a 71-year-old Christian Democrat, was the candidate of a
17-party center-left coalition and won Thursday's presidential
election with 55.2 percent of the vote. Hernan Buchi, 40, the
candidate backed by the military regime, received 29.4 percent with
the remainder divided among minor candidates.
   Aylwin is scheduled to take office March 11, succeeding Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, the army commander who has been president since
leading the coup that ousted the government of Marxist President
Salvador Allende in September 1973. Pinochet, a hard-line rightist,
had said he will remain as army commander after the military turns
over power to the new elected government.

give the floor to that end of the room. Yes? Which paper?    Mr. President.
Yes? I can't really _ I can't really see you, I mean _ but that's your
_ I'm terribly sorry. You're saying _ you're standing in the shadows, but
you're able to move out of the shadows, nonetheless, if I give you the
floor...    Thank you, Mr. President. May I continue to say, Thank you,
Mr. President?    Q: Well, obviously the question of evolution of the
east was the major question today but the question of a nonevolution in
the east is also a major question. The question of Romania in particular.
Is there a common _ a position of common action been decided or will be
decided?    MITTERRAND: Well, a common position is very easy to determne
this is a regime which we condemn. These are behaviors which are unacceptable
and intolerable, in fact. And this is in Romania in relation to the sovereign
state.    I mean, we deplore the situation that the Romanian people have
to live in and we do hope that the winds of freedom, which have been blowing
through other countries of Europe will also come to Romania, so our feelings
cannot be misunderstood.    And for the rest, I presume they have nothing
to add.        Q: Monsieur Mitterrand.    MITTERRAND: Yes?       
Q: Also on the Romanian _ Excuse me, may I have your answer on the problem
of Romania after what President Mitterrand has just said?    BUSH: My
response is ``ditto.'' The same. (laughter.)    We view Romania as way
behind the power curve in terms of change and it's too bad that they are
behaving as they are, but let's hope they'll get the word, too.    Q:
Mr. President, my question is addressed to you on Lebanon. If General Aoun
refuses to leave, do you approve of a military operation against him, and
did you discuss this situation with President Mitterrand?    BUSH: We
did discuss the Lebanese situation. Both of us want to see a bloodbath
avoided there.    It is the position of the United States that Mr.
Hrawi is the head of government there and recognized as such and that,
in our view, things would be much benefited if Mr. Aoun left.    But I
will let President Mitterrand obviously address himself on that point.
   But we are together in working as best we can to avoid bloodshed, and
we have supported the tripartheid agreement, and again, I'd like to salute
them here, because without that, I don't think this process would be anywhere
along, and so let's just hope they can resolve this matter without the
loss of a lot of innocent life in Lebanon.    It plagues me, particularly
at this joyous time of the year, that Lebanon is having this terrible,
terrible grief.    MITTERRAND: I have already stated my views on this.
       Q: Do you still have differences on accepting President Gorbachev's
offer to move the CFCE talks from 1992 up to 1990?    Did you, considering
your affection for each other _ were you able to sway each other's opinion
on this? And if not, could you explain your different opinions?    MITTERRAND:
Well, I have already stated in _ (inaudible) _ in particular that I agreed
for this meeting to be held _ (inaudible) _ next year, because I think
that the events at the pace they are moving should be followed closely.
   But I haven't tried to proselytize vis-a-vis President Bush.    And
I think _ I mean, he can see matters for himself.    BUSH: (inaudible)
_ very well indeed, and when I talked to Mr. Gorbachev, we talked about
trying to complete the conventional force agreement so we would have a
CFE summit.    I also expressed an open mind about the CFCE, but we want
to know a little more about that. So we had a very good meeting _ so we
had a very good discussion with the President of France to understand it
better.    That matter, incidentally, was not raised by me _ to me by
President Gorbachev, as you may remember. So this was an interesting discussion,
and I think I understand the hopes of President Mitterrand as a result
of the discussion.

<TEXT>ST. MARTIN: the discussion.    MITTERRAND: Yes?        Q: Do the
two of you disagree over whether CFCE or NATO should be the proper forum,
and within the alliance, for discussing the changes in Eastern Europe?
   MITTERRAND: Well, these are two meeting places which are equally important.
For the time being, the advantage of CFC is that it groups all European
countries _ all of them, which is not the case of NATO, which is an expression
of an alliance, and this is why it had been proposed that we give another
content to NATO.    But that's not _ we have not. But to deal with today's
reality, and today's reality is that all European countries can debate
within CFC which is desirable, and is not at all in contradiction with
any new behavior or any new evolutions in NATO. But we have not advanced
sufficiently in this field for me to be able to say more.    BUSH: I'd
simply say there are many forums. You've got CFCE, you got the EC, you've
NATO, you've got the G-7. You have a wide array of groups that are interested
in the peaceful, democratic evolution change in Europe. And so it isn't
a question of one or the other, and I think I would simply say the President
of France expressed it very well there.        Q: May I follow that up?
   MITTERRAND: You've already spoken _ haven't you spoken already? (iaughter)
       Q: May I simply ask sir, do you feel that as the need for the
American military _ again? Do you feel that as the need for the American
nuclear shield recedes, that American political leadership of NATO will
recede as well?    MITTERRAND: Well, all this some day we will discuss
amongst ourselves. We cannot prejudge any result to a situation which is
evolving, obviously.    If the risk of conflict and antagonism between
the two blocks recede, obviously the military content of the alliance could
change. But, it is nothing else I can add to this.    Yes. You sir? 
      Q: Mr. President, do you expect that the rapid changes occuring
in Eastern Europe will have a spillover effect in other areas of
the world, particularly in South Africa, and probably here in the Caribbean,
in Cuba?        MITTERRAND: And who is the question addressed to?  
 Well, I mean, it's a difficult question _ practically impossible. It's
true that failure of the Eastern European systems will obviously have a
spillover effect on other regions of the world where their system was imitated.
It's likely.    You take a country such as Benin, which has just officially
stated that it renounced its definition, criterium of Marxism-Leninism.
But, as I say, cannot prejudge of the reactions of those countries that
you have mentioned.        Q: Same question to you and to President Bush.
You met with President Gorbachev for a very long time recently. I imagine
he discussed the difficulties he has within his country. Do you have the
feeling that he will outlast the winter?    MITTERRAND: Yes, and probably
beyond that, as well. I hope I'm not wrong. Yes, madame?        Q: My
question is to the President of the United States. Mr. President,
Mikhail Gorbachev quite often mentions his idea of the common European
house. Is there any room for you Americans in this common house? What kind
of house would you like it to be? What model house, what layout? Could
you tell us about it _ the kind of house that you would like to see? 
  BUSH: Yes, I think that even Mr. Gorbachev recognizes a role for the
United States in this common European home. We talk about a Europe ``whole
and free.'' He talks about a ``common European home.'' He talked to us
about wanting to see the United States remain involved. So, I don't find
any countries suggesting that the United States should decouple from Europe,
even the bloc countries.    I know that the countries in Eastern Europe,
to whose leaders I've talked _ Poland and Hungary _ certainly feel that
way. So I don't think you're going to see out of all this dynamic change
a tendency to try to push the United States out of Europe.    You might
see some isolationistic pressures develop in our country that I will fight,
because I don't want to see us decoupled from Europe. I don't want to see
us ``pull out'' of Europe, if you will. I want to see us work with the
EC, as I talked about and as Secretary Baker elaborated on. So, I don't
think there's any pressure to see us disengage, you might say.    MITTERRAND:
You know, it's very difficult, amongst all the questions, the hands that
are raised _ yes, behind? And then come to you afterwards.

<TEXT>
   The nation's new interim leader
says an election will be held in January to replace the president
who was assassinated three weeks ago as European mercenaries took
control of the islands.
   The announcement came Friday, the day after about 40 mercenaries
relinquished control of the country to French troops.
   Said Mohamed Djohar, the new interim leader, invited six
opposition parties, including the opposition Democratic Front, to
take part in a ``free and democratic'' presidential election.
Djohar said the election should be held in mid-January under the
supervision of international observers.
   French soldier of fortune Bob Denard and the other European
mercenaries left the islands Thursday and Friday, with some flying
from Moroni to Paris and some to Johannesburg, South Africa.
   France, the former colonial power, sent 200 troops to the
islands after Djohar requested military assistance under a mutual
defense treaty to restore the country's security. South Africa is
involved because it has a major financial interest in the islands
off southeastern Africa.
   South African and French officials were reported to be trying to
find a final destination for the mercenaries. A spokesman for the
South African government said the mercenaries ``should leave as
soon as possible.''
   The exact number of Mercenaries who were in the islands was
uncertain. South African government sources said there were about
45.
   The sources said more than 20 mercenaries and 17 family members,
including Denard's Comoran wife and their two children, left the
islands Thursday night on a flight to Paris.
   Denard and the 21 remaining mercenaries were flown to South
Africa on Friday.
   The independent South African Press Association reported that 18
of the 22 mercenaries who came to South Africa left the country by
plane Saturday night. It reported that an unidentified spokeswoman
for the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed the 18 had departed
but did not give their destination. She said Denard was not among
the 18.
   A South African Airways flight left Johannesburg for Paris on
Saturday night, and it was believed the 18 French mercenaries were
aboard.
   South Africa wants Denard to leave, the government sources said,
but he is still negotiating with authorities in France, where he
faces legal charges stemming from his involvement in a failed coup
attempt in the West African country of Benin in 1977.
   The soldiers of fortune, who led and trained the Comoran
Presidential Guard, had disarmed the regular army and effectively
controlled the islands since President Ahmed Abdallah was
assassinated Nov. 26.
   Most Comorans believe Denard or his men carried out the killing.
Denard has claimed he was in the room when Abdallah, whom he
brought to power in a 1978 coup, was shot accidentally by a
bodyguard.
   Denard _ who had taken out Comoran citizenship, married a local
woman and acquired substantial real estate and business interests _
was seen arguing with Abdallah before the assassination. Denard
also is believed to have played a role in an attempt to overthrow
the president of Benin more than a decade ago.
   All was reported calm on the Comoros on Saturday, and two of the
four French warships that had taken up positions near the islands
on Friday withdrew to the French-administered island of Mayotte.
   The 50 French troops remaining in the Comoro Republic took
control of stocks of munitions formerly belonging to the
Presidential Guard. Djohar has asked the soldiers to reorganize the
Comoran military, until now split between the elite Presidential
Guard and the poorly trained and equipped regular army.
   The transfer of control from the Presidential Guard to the
French forces at Moroni airport ended several weeks of efforts by
France and South Africa to dislodge Denard and his men.
   Both French and South African officials stressed that none of
the mercenaries had been paid ``one cent'' in exchange for their
departure. Denard had reportedly requested millions of dollars as
the price of his leaving.
   The Comoro Republic is made up of three islands off Africa. A
fourth island in the archipelago, Mayotte, remains French. Most of
the 450,000 African, Arab and Malay residents are subsistence
farmers with annual incomes of about $300.
   In another development Saturday, a Comoran politician accused of
leading a failed 1985 coup was released from jail.
   Authorities freed Moustoifa Said Cheikh, leader of the
opposition Democratic Front, who had been sentenced to life
imprisonment for the November 1985 coup that failed to topple
Abdallah.

   The liftoff of space shuttle
Columbia scheduled for Thursday will be delayed again because of
lagging work at the launch pad, sources said Saturday.
   The mission to launch and retrieve a satellite has already been
postponed twice. No new date will be set until shuttle managers
meet Monday, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not
officially changed the liftoff set for 6:04 p.m. Thursday.
   The new date could be Friday or Saturday. But NASA has said that
if it can't launch by Saturday, it would delay the effort until at
least Dec. 27 to free workers for the Christmas holiday.
   The sources said there is a possibility the flight could be put
off until New Year's Day to give workers a longer holiday and to
permit an annual electrical inspection of space center facilities
planned during the last week of each year.
   The launch had been scheduled for this Monday, but last
Wednesday NASA postponed it by two days. On Friday, it delayed the
launch another day.
   The delays have been caused by unfinished work on launch pad
39A, which hasn't been used for a shuttle launch in nearly four
years. A two-year, $50 million refurbishment of the complex was
recently completed, and technicians have not finished checking
several systems, such as ground lines that carry fuel to the
shuttle.
   Some tiny fuel leaks and other minor problems have turned up,
slowing work.
   A new mobile launch platform is being used for the first time,
and checking some of its systems has taken longer than anticipated.
   During 10 days in space, Columbia's five astronauts are to
release a communications satellite for the Navy, then track down
and retrieve a large science satellite that has been orbiting Earth
for six years.

<TEXT>ST. MARTIN: you afterwards.    Q: My question is to President Bush
_ I have a question of Panama. Noriega, obviously _ well you intend to
try and get rid of him, but it's known that when you're responsible for
the CIA, he also collaborated with the CIA. Don't you think that your margin
for maneuver here is a very narrow one indeed?    BUSH: Yes, I think _
(inaudible) _ with the Central Intelligence Agency but I think its narrow
margin for maneuvers _ it's a good way of putting it _ but that doesn't
lessen our determination to see the Panamanian people get what they want
and that is a democratic form of government. And it doesn't lessen my determination
to see this indicted drug dealer brought to trial.    MITTERRAND: We're
reaching the last questions because we do _ we are short of time now. Yes,
sir?        Q: Mr. President, can you tell us as you approach the next
budget year in the United States, can you confirm for us that you are considering
real dollar cuts in the U.S. defense budget? And considering a meeting
like this one, can you let us in on some of your thinking? When you think
about those budget cuts, are they driven by the legal necessity in the
United States to reduce the budget, or rather by events in each _ Eastern
Europe?    BUSH: I think events in Eastern Europe are driving some to
suggest that we can dramatically slash our defense budget. I will resist
that. I can't give you a final figure.    The budget will be put to bed,
from administration's standpoint early this coming week. But I would not
look in dollar terms for cuts.    There are places we can save and we're
going to be always looking for them. But I will resist these euphoric views
that we no longer need a very strong defense. We do need it. And I think
our European friends understand that.    I would like to move forward
in the arms control agenda that we've got before us, talking about START,
chemical weapons, and conventional forces, and that should not be the end.
We should move beyond those.    As you know, we've instructed the
Pentagon to do some very serious analysis in terms of looking at what kind
of force will be needed into the future, estimating as best they can what
the threat will be. So, we're in the process of doing that right now. But
I would not look for the administration to send up dramatically reduced
levels of spending in defense.    I hope some day that we can have a far
different force, and deployed far differently. But we are not going to
unilaterally pull away from our friends in NATO without serious consultation,
and we're not going to pull away from our obligations elsewhere. But we
are reviewing the whole defense budget given the changes that have taken
place.    MITTERRAND: It is impossible to prolong this press conference.
Sir, no _ you already spoke, I'm sorry. No, you've already spoken, no,
no, sit down. You already asked a question. Many others might complain
that they weren't able to do so. Yes, one last question. You sir.    
   Q: I would like to ask President Mitterrand if you extended on
behalf of the EC an invitation to the United States to join this bank for
European reconstruction and development, and I would like to ask President
Bush what the U.S. position is in terms of joining that bank?    MITTERRAND:
I told President Bush that I had precisely signed in Paris just before
I left, I signed a letter in which I invite the United States of America
to participate in the creation of capital and the _ and this bank. And
my letter was sent to many other directions because it's not a bank of
the community. It is a bank which goes far beyond this.    It's to the
24 _ to all those who wish and who are able to _ including to Eastern European
countries, and particularly the Soviet Union, if they were to accept to
make the necessary effort that Mr. Gorbachev has already given me his agreement.
It was.    Thank you very much. We have to leave you now. Thank you President
Bush, once more. Oh, here _ he will answer you, yes. But afterwards, we
leave.    BUSH: We discussed it, expressed keen interest in it and decided
that we would talk about it further. But the United States is very interested
in that proposal, would be interested in being a part of it, but at this
juncture we need to know a little bit more about the details of it, that
we gave a positive indication of American interest to President Mitterrand.
   MITTERRAND: I have already planned a meeting to start the work on 15th
of January next, and in the meantime will no doubt have the necessary answers.
Thank you, and thank you particularly to President Bush, who did prove
his friendship coming here to St. Martin. And I wish him now Godspeed.

<HEAD>Authorities Negotiate for Release of Multimillionaire Hostage</HEAD>

   Authorities were negotiating Saturday
at a house where six Chilean revolutionaries held hostage the owner
of one of the country's largest supermarket chains, police said.
   Police surrounded the house in the city of Sao Paulo after
arresting five people involved in the case late Friday.
   Oscar Maksod of the city police Anti-Kdnapping Squad told
reporters that Abilio Diniz Filho was being held by six kidnappers
_ four men and two women. He described the kidnappers as ``members
of a foreign revoultionary group'' but did not identify it.
   The 53-year-old Diniz Filho, the multimillionaire owner of the
Pao de Acucar supermarket chain, was kidnapped early Monday in
front of his house. His family and police asked the press not to
release the story of the abduction to safeguard his life.
   One of those arrested Friday night, a Chilean women identified
only as Rubia, took police to the lower middle-class neighborhood
where Diniz Filho was being held in a small, two-story house.
   The kidnappers demanded an armored car and a plane to escape to
an unidentified country.
   Negotiators, including former finance minister Luis Carlos
Bresser Pereira, a close friend of the captive, agreed to the
kidnappers' demands as long as they released Diniz Filho. The
kidnappers insisted on taking their hostage in their flight.
   However, Jairo Pires, spokesman for the Sao Paulo State Security
Department, later said authorities would ``not give in to any of
the kidnappers' demands.''
   ``All we will negotiate is the exchange of their lives for the
life of the victim,'' he said.
   The Pao de Acucar supermarket chain also has branches in
Portugal, Angola and Guinea Bissau. It is expected to turn a $2
billion profit this year, according to the network TV Globom.

   A 6-year-old boy reported missing when he
didn't return home from school apparently was asleep Saturday in
the back of a bus the whole time police searched for him on the
ground and by helicopter.
   Glen S. Bacon was still snoozing when officers found him
stretched out in the back of a Boys Club bus at about 3:30 a.m.
Saturday, said police Lt. T.A. Kessler.
   The first-grader usually takes the bus to the Interbay Boys Club
each day after school. When the boy's grandmother went to pick him
up early Friday evening, she learned he had never arrived.
   Police launched a search that included using the department's
helicopter and going door-to-door in the neighborhood where Glen
lives.
   ``He apparently fell asleep on his way to the boy's club,''
Kessler said. ``He was scrunched down, so at first it looked like
the bus was empty.''
   After a whole night of searching, an officer decided to
backtrack.
   ``They found him,'' Kessler said. ``He slept through the whole
thing.''

<HEAD>Kohl Praises Hungary for Leading Role in East European Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Visiting Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany praised Hungary on Saturday for leading the reforms
sweeping Eastern Europe and said it ``knocked the first stone'' out
of the Berlin Wall.
   Kohl, who arrived earlier in the day for an official three-day
visit, thanked Hungary as he received an honorary doctorate at
Eoetvoes Lorand University.
   ``Hungary knocked the first stone from the Wall,'' Kohl said,
referring to the decision to open Hungarian borders with Austria on
Sept. 11.
   The exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans to West Germany
via Hungary and Austria helped spark unprecedented political
reforms in the ruling Communist parties of East Germany and other
Soviet-bloc countries.
   Kohl said that without the ``courageous decision by the
Hungarian government,'' the dramatic changes in East Germany would
not have happened _ at least not so quickly.
   ``The solidarity and help of the Hungarians for the people who
were longing for freedom will not be forgotten,'' Kohl told the
university audience.
   He promised additional West German financial aid to help Hungary
restructure its economy and society.
   Kohl's government has set aside for Hungary state-guaranteed
credits worth millions of dollars.
   Kohl was welcomed at the airport by Hungarian Premier Miklos
Nemeth. The two held talks Saturday afternoon, and Kohl will
address Parliament on Monday.

<TEXT>
   A slight wind shift brought a haze of
ash from Redoubt Volcano drifting down on Alaska's largest city and
the Kenai Peninsula on Saturday, triggering power outages, health
alerts and warnings to motorists.
   The volcano 115 miles southwest of here quieted down somewhat in
its third day of activity, but still belched ash skyward. Ash
drifted as far south as Oregon, and was expected to reach
California and Arizona by Sunday.
   The U.S. Geological Survey described the amount of ash sent up
Saturday as ``low to moderate,'' significantly less than was hurled
into the air Friday with Redoubt's largest eruption since emerging
from a 23-year sleep. The volcano southwest of Anchorage began
erupting Thursday.
   Until the wind shift Saturday, fallout had been bypassing this
city of about 250,000 residents. The Kenai Peninsula south of
Anchorage also had escaped the mess, but the peninsula towns of
Soldotna and Nikiski seemed to get the worst of it Saturday.
   ``I'm looking out my bedroom window and it looks like I'm
standing on a beach,'' said Linell McCrumb of Soldotna, across Cook
Inlet from Redoubt. She said about a half-inch of coarse ash
covered the ground.
   ``It was incredibly dark,'' McCrumb said. She said the ash cloud
was so thick she couldn't see sunrise.
   The Soldotna Police Department told people to stay indoors, and
a 10-point advisory issued by the state included a recommendation
that people with lung ailments not venture out.
   Police in Soldotna and Anchorage advised leaving cars parked to
limit the chance of engine damage. Some businesses covered
sensitive computers and other equipment for fear ash would filter
into buildings.
   Anchorage International Airport stayed open, but ``we're getting
very little traffic in or out,'' said Sgt. Charles Barton, an
airport safety officer. He had no estimate of how many carriers had
canceled or diverted flights.
   Mechanics planned to inspect a Boeing 747 airliner that made a
safe emergency landing at the airport Friday after it flew through
ash, lost power to all four engines and fell more than two miles.
The engines of the KLM Royal Dutch Airlines jet with 245 people
aboard were restarted before the landing. There were no reports of
injuries, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
   Down in the Lower 48 states, pilots reported ash from the
volcano was in the skies over Idaho, Washington and Oregon at
altitudes of between 3{ miles and 8 miles. The ash should continue
to move south, reaching Utah, Nevada, California and Arizona by
Sunday morning, the National Weather Service predicted.
   The ash in the sky over Anchorage on Saturday came at a time
when daylight is in short supply: the city is so far north that it
gets only about 5{ hours of light at this time of year. The
shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere occurs in less
than a week.
   For a time Saturday, parts of Soldotna and Kenai lacked even
artificial light. Ash settled on insulators and lines, knocking out
power to about 15,000 to 20,000 Homer Electric Association
customers around 5 a.m., said John Sorrels, an area superintendent
for the utility.
   ``We've got all of our crews out working, but it's hard for them
to breathe and see,'' even with masks and goggles, Sorrels said.
   Power was restored promptly in some places, but outages
continued to occur, he said.
   Geologist Tom Miller of the USGS said Redoubt went through an
ash-spewing ``period of tremor'' for just over an hour early
Saturday morning and experienced another one that began at about
6:15 a.m. Saturday and tapered off about 2{ hours later.
   ``Our assumption would be that this would be going on like it is
for a period of several days, then I assume we would get a period
of quiescence,'' Miller said. ``Then we may go back through a
similar period of what we've been experiencing.''
   The logistical impact of the volcanic eruptions was felt as far
away as Barrow, the United States' northernmost community. The high
school varsity basketball games in the Arctic Coast town 725 miles
north of Anchorage were canceled Friday because flight
interruptions in Anchorage made it impossible for visiting teams to
travel.
   Daily deliveries of newspapers flown from Anchorage and
Fairbanks were halted, and some teachers from schools in outlying
villages found themselves stranded in Barrow, unable to get flights
out for the start of Christmas vacations.

<TEXT>
   A California endurance swimmer who has
crossed the Bering Strait plans to risk the treacherous, icy waters
along the southernmost tip of South America next month.
   Lynne Cox, 32, of Los Alamitos plans to leave Sunday for
Washington, D.C., to to work out the final diplomatic details of
her swim through the Beagle Channel, a waterway along the
long-disputed Argentina-Chile border 100 miles north of Cape Horn.
   The 5- to 15-mile channel crossing marks Ms. Cox's most
ambitious swim. The Pacific and Atlantic oceans collide in the
narrow channel, creating strong, erratic currents and choppy waves.
   Water temperatures range from 38 degrees to 45 degrees.
Scientists say that most people die of hypothermia after 20 minutes
in 38-degree water, but Ms. Cox plans to spend at least two hours
in the water.
   The swim is to take place between Jan. 11 and Jan. 25, depending
on the weather, wind and water currents.
   ``This is going to be more difficult, more cold, more remote,
and more of a real challenge than anything I have ever done,'' Ms.
Cox said in a telephone interview from her home Friday.
   She already has attracted international attention for dangerous
endurance swims that would leave most other long-distance swimmers
cold.
   In 1987, she overcame superpower politics and the 39-degree
waters off western Alaska to swim about five miles across the
Bering Strait from Little Diomede Island in the United States to
Big Diomede Island in the Soviet Union.
   The unprecedented crossing drew warm praise from Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who helped clear the way for Ms. Cox' 11-mile
swim in August 1988 across Siberia's Lake Baikal, the world's
deepest lake.
   Both swims were intended to promote Soviet-American friendship.
   The Beagle Channel swim is designed to symbolically bring
together Argentina and Chile, two countries that have fought over
land around the channel for a century.
   ``I like the idea of reaching beyond borders in many areas _ the
idea of reaching beyond political borders and also the
psychological borders,'' she said.
   The swim also is a test of her physical abilities.
   ``I did the Bering Strait. This is sort of to reach beyond that,
to see how much further you can go,'' she said.
   Ms. Cox, who is in prime distance-swimming form of 180 pounds on
a 5-foot-6 frame, also has crossed the English Channel and the
Strait of Magellan.
   She plans to leave for Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Friday, where
she will stay until Dec. 27. From there, she plans to travel to the
Argentine city of Ushuaia, where she will slowly acclimate herself
to the channel's frigid waters.
   ``Right now, I'm going through all the emotions you normally go
through in a day,'' she said. ``You're excited. You're afraid.
You're uncertain. You're hopeful. All sorts of emotions.
   ``But I do know, that when I first go down there and put my toe
in that cold water, I'll say, `My God, what did I get into this
time?'''

   A 2-year-old boy who received a split liver in
a transplant last week died Saturday, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Mitchell Wallace of Hannibal, N.Y., died of multiple systems
failure about 12:20 p.m., said Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh
spokeswoman Margie Buczynski.
   Doctors plan to perform tests to determine what caused the
failure, she said.
   A lack of available donor organs led Pittsburgh doctors to split
one liver for transplant into Mitchell and a 3-year-old child
Wednesday.
   The hospital did not identify or release other details about the
other child at the request of parents.
   The 3-year-old has been taken out of the hospital's intensive
care unit and was in serious condition late Saturday, Ms. Buczynski
said.
   Wednesday's surgery was the hospital's second attempt at
transplanting a liver into two young patients. Mitchell received
his first split liver Nov. 29 at Children's Hospital.
   Dr. Robert Gordon, a transplant surgeon at University of
Pittsburgh hospitals, said last week that Mitchell's first
transplanted liver had not been functioning properly.
   Before the operations, Mitchell had suffered from liver failure
of unknown origin. After his own liver was removed, he was found to
have hepatitis.

   Santa Claus floated over Skid Row in a
hot-air balloon Saturday to the cheers of a throng of poor children
as a downtown mission gave away thousands of toys, trees and food
to celebrate the Christmas season.
   Several streets around the Fred Jordan Mission were closed to
traffic and were filled with children and their parents, mostly
only mothers, as volunteers placed toys and food into sacks to give
away as presents.
   For most of the families it would be the only Christmas
celebration, said Tom Jordan, son of the late founder of the
mission.
   ``I believe that well over 90 percent would not have anything
out of the ordinary if it wasn't for this Christmas party,'' he
said.
   Jordan estimated that between 15,000 and 25,000 homeless or
needy children and their families would take part by the end of the
day.
   The mission had more than 40,000 toys, 25,000 sacks containing
fixings for chicken dinners, 8,000 Christmas trees and 8,000
blankets to give away.
   Individuals and companies donated the goods, said Mary Ann
Milhous, who with her husband, Paul, helped plan the party and
marshal 500 volunteers.
   ``I think the motivation is the children,'' said Mrs. Milhous.
``There are more (poor) women and children now.
   ``I think it's the Christmas spirit,'' she said. ``It makes
Christmas Christmas.''
   The fun included musical entertainment and Santa bobbing
overhead beneath a tethered hot air balloon.
   The mission, which has been serving poor people since 1944,
provides 1,000 meals a day, gives 250 people beds each night and
offers programs for children and rehabilitation for drug and
alcohol abusers.
   The holiday spirit was present elsewhere in Southern California
as well.
   Actress Betty White led a group of entertainers on a visit to
Rancho Los Amigos hospital in Downey for an all-day spree of
gift-giving, wheelchair races and visits by Santa Claus to patients.
   The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has organized visits
by stars to Rancho Los Amigos for 20 years. This year the
celebrities brought $25,000 worth of donated gifts.

   A celluloid from ``Fantasia'' depicting Mickey
Mouse as a sorcerer's apprentice and others of Peter Pan and Bambi
were among the top sellers Saturday at an auction at Sotheby's.
   The Mickey Mouse celluloid from the 1940 Walt Disney film sold
for $22,000, said Julia Zagrodnik, a Sotheby's spokeswoman.
   The celluloid of Peter Pan, from the 1953 Disney film of the
same name, sold for $17,600, she said.
   Saturday's top seller was a 1900 French musical puppet, ``The
Drunkard,'' that nods its head and sways as it tries to lift a
bottle to its lips. It sold for $23,100, Zagrodnik said.
   The auction marked the second day of the ``Collectors
Carrousel'' sale that included dolls and toys as well as Hollywood
memorabilia. The two days brought in a total of $1.1 million,
Zagrodnik said.
   An oil painting by Batman creator Bob Kane of the Caped Crusader
atop a building with skyscrapers in the background, circa 1945,
sold for $13,200, she said.
   A Bambi celluloid from the 1942 Walt Disney movie ``Bambi'' sold
for $11,000, she said.
   In another auction Saturday, Christie's sold art and furnishings
that appeared in Paramount and RKO films for a total of $1.6
million.
   The top sellers included a circa 1900 Baroque-style giltwood and
painted grand piano that was used in the Paramount films ``Death
Takes a Holiday'' (1934) and ``Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), as well
as in an episode of the television series ``Star Trek.'' The piano
sold for $60,500.
   A pair of Italian Rococo burl-walnut commodes from the mid-18th
Century, which appeared in the films ``Slightly Scarlet'' (1956)
and ``Susan Slept Here'' (1954), sold for $275,000, Christie's said.

   Communist rebels killed a mayor and
seven bodyguards in an ambush in northern Cagayan province, the
military reported Saturday.
   It said insurgents of the communist New People's Army are
stepping up their attacks following the unsuccessful coup attempt
by some military units earlier this month.
   A military report said the ambush occurred Friday on a highway
about 220 miles north of Manila and the rebels killed Tuao Mayor
Roberto Guimbuayan, four policeman and three civilan bodyguards. It
said the killers escaped.
   Gen. Renato de Villa, the chief of staff, said the communist
guerrillas were taking advantage of confusion within the armed
forces since military mutineers launched assaults Dec. 1 trying to
overthrow the government of President Corazon Aquino.
   He said communist guerrillas have made 17 attacks this month. He
gave no casualty figures, but other reports indicate at least 23
people were killed in the guerrilla assaults.
   At least 113 people were killed and more than 500 wounded in
violence related to the military revolt that collapsed Dec. 9 when
the last mutineers gave up.
   The armed forces said at least 3,000 military personnel took
part in the coup attempt and more than half have been taken into
custody by loyal forces. The armed forces have about 160,000
members.
   Rumors persist of renegade troops trying to renew the uprising.
   De Villa told reporters about 500 marines were airlifted Friday
to Davao City, 550 miles southeast of Manila, where there were
report of rebel troopers planning new attacks. But he added:
   ``The coup is finished, and we are just making sure that the
situation does not deteriorate.''

   Vietnamese refugees demonstrated Saturday to
protest the forced repatriation of their compatriots in Hong Kong
and released 51 black balloons, one for each person returned to
Hanoi.
   About 150 people attended the rally, the first of a series
planned around the country by the Vietnam Refugee National Council
to protest Britain's decision to repatriate boat people last week.
   Britain argues that most of the Vietnamese confined to squalid
camps in Hong Kong were fleeing poverty when they left their
homeland, not persecution, and therefore don't qualify for refugee
status.
   The deportations Tuesday were the first of thousands expected in
coming years. About 12,000 boat people in Hong Kong have qualified
as refugees under United Nations criteria and will be resettled.
But about 44,000 others face repatriation.
   The protesters and their supporters gathered in Trafalgar Square
in the rain and sang the old Vietnamese national anthem in use
before the Communists came to power in 1975. Then they stood
silently in memory of those who died fighting Communist oppression
and listened to a series of speakers.
   ``Repatriation is evil,'' guitarist Steve Hackett of the rock
group Genesis told the crowd. ``We urge the Hong Kong government to
dismantle the fences and the compounds.''
   Hackett is the organizer of a group of musicians called Rock
Against Repatriation, which is making a special recording of the
song ``Sailing'' _ once a hit for Rod Stewart _ with proceeds going
to improve camp conditions. It is expected to be released Jan. 20.
   The Rev. Michael Meadows, who worked in the former South
Vietnamese capital of Saigon, told the protesters: ``Our government
ought not to be too gullible in accepting assurances from the
government of Hanoi that these people will be properly treated on
their return.''
   ``Vietnam has a very poor record on human rights and we ought to
think once or twice before accepting their assurances,'' he said.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has said the British Embassy in
Hanoi will monitor the treatment of those returning, but opposition
lawmakers said it would be impossible to do that with such a small
staff.
   Vietnam has told Britain it rejects any forced repatriation of
boat people from Hong Kong and reserves the right to send them back
to the British colony.
   A Vietnam News Agency report monitored in Bangkok Saturday said
a Foreign Ministry official on Friday delivered a note on Vietnam's
position to the British ambassador to Hanoi, Emrys Davies.
   The agency said the note affirmed the policy of rejecting forced
repatriation and ``and only accepting those who volunteer to return
or who are not opposed to the repatriation.''
   A British Foreign Office spokesman said the Vietnamese message
did not represent a change in that country's position and that
there would be no change in British policy.
   Britain has been criticized, especially in the United States,
for forcibly returning the refugees.
   The House of Commons will debate the deportations on Tuesday.
The government has halted further repatriations until after
Christmas.

<HEAD>Episcopal Diocese To Ordain Avowed Homosexual</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Newark Episcopal Diocese ordained a
homosexual activist as a priest Saturday in the most open challenge
of a 1979 church resolution discouraging the ordination of gays.
   ``I'm floating on air. It was wonderful,'' the newly ordained
Rev. J. Robert Williams, 34, said at a reception afterwards.
``That's not very articulate, but it's all I can do.''
   About 150 people attended the ceremony at All Saints Church,
which lasted nearly three hours and was interrupted briefly by a
minister opposed to the ordination.
   The Rev. Skip Robokoff of Fort Lee Gospel Church jumped up
during the ceremony and shouted, ``Homosexuality is an
abomination!'' before being escorted out.
   Three demonstrators picketed outside the church.
   Williams officially entered the priesthood when more than a
dozen visiting clergy gathered around him for a laying on of hands.
His live-in companion, James Skelly, a member of the church's
choir, draped a red and gold satin vestment over Williams'
shoulders before the ritual.
   Bishop John Shelby Spong, who heads the Newark Diocese, gave
Williams a Bible and Communion vessels. He told the audience that
because of the ordination, ``our Anglican community is more honest,
open, loving, inclusive and Christ-like.''
   The congregation applauded for a minute after the ordination
ended.
   Two people were permitted to voice objections during the
ceremony.
   Elaine Sullivan of Passaic, representing the conservative
Episcopal Synod of America, said she objected because ``it is not
in conformity with Scripture.''
   Theodore Arnheiter of St. Mary's church in Tuxedo Park, N.Y.,
echoed her complaint.
   James Solheim, director of the National Episcopal Church, said
afterwards that the issue of ordaining homosexuals ``is just not
resolved. It's been called the most divisive issue for the church
since slavery.''
   He said a church commission is studying the question and will
make report before the next meeting in 1991 of the General
Convention, the church's governing body.
   The presiding bishop of the 2.5 million-member Episcopal Church,
the Most Rev. Edmund L. Browning of New York, said in a statement
that he hoped the ordination ``will encourage positive debate
rather than polarization.''
   The synod, a conservative body led by Bishop Clarence Pope of
the Fort Worth, Texas, Diocese that also opposes the church's
ordination of women, had asked Spong to refrain from ordaining
Williams. Pope said the ordination violates a 1979 resolution of
the General Convention.
   The resolution, drafted two years after the ordination of a
lesbian deacon in New York caused a stir, says it is inappropriate
for the church to ordain a practicing homosexual.
   There is argument among Episcopalians about whether the
resolution carries the force of church law. The synod says the
resolution is law. Spong and other bishops who dissented in 1979
say it is not.
   Church officials acknowledge that other gay people have been
ordained since Ms. Barrett's ordination in 1977, but say none has
been as politically active in homosexual causes as Williams.
   Williams, a Texas native who started a ministry for homosexuals
in Hoboken called Oasis in All Saints, said hundreds of Episcopal
priests are gay but most keep their sexual orientation private.
   He said he wants to minister mainly to members of the gay
community.
   Williams, a graduate of the Episcopal Divinity School in
Cambridge, Mass., has had a relationship with Skelly, 39, a
hospital administrator, since 1985.
   Skelly's ex-wife, Suzanne, and their daughters, Victoria and
Vanessa, also attended the ceremony.

<TEXT>
   HO-HO-KUS, N.J. (AP) _ A Japanese furniture manufacturer paid
$60,300 in a sealed-bid auction Saturday for the nuptial bed of
Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio, the seller said.
   Hiromi Okawa, chairman of the Oliver America High Point
Woodworking Co. of High Point, N.C., was the lone bidder, said June
Regal, owner of Regal Antiques in this northern New Jersey
community.
   Okawa said he heard of the auction while listening to the radio
in Japan. ``I feel very fortunate to have won this bid,'' he wrote
in a letter to Regal.
   Regal held an auction featuring 30 items from a Beverly Hills
rental house that Monroe and the New York Yankees slugger shared
for the eight months they were married in 1954.
   ``Marilyn Monroe has a special mystique for people all over the
world and our company is very pleased to be able to share memories
of Marilyn Monroe with everyone,'' Okawa said.
   Regal had set a minimum bid of $25,000 for the 19th-century,
four-post oak bed. She said Okawa's company manufactures oak copies
of Early American furniture, a style that is becoming very popular
in Japan.
   Regal said she had expected an avalanche of bids for the bed and
was amazed at the tepid response.

   Ten Soviet scientists were in
California on Saturday to inspect a ``Star Wars'' research

   The focus of the visit to the TRW Capistrano Test Site was the
Alpha chemical laser for Zenith Star, a Strategic Defense

laser is viable.
   The Soviet delegation arrived at El Toro Marine Corps Air

   Yuri Nazarkin, the Soviet ambassador to the talks, led the
Soviet delegation.

   The tour of U.S. facilities doing SDI research stemmed from a
meeting between Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign

   A group of U.S. officials visited two laboratories in the Soviet
Union last summer.
   The Soviets plan to spend Sunday in California, then travel to

<TEXT>
   The government has drastically tightened
security to guard against retaliation by drug traffickers angered
by the killing of one of the top cocaine cartel leaders, an
official said Saturday.
   Police shot and killed Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, 42, during a
raid Friday on his hideout on Colombia's northern coast.
   Military officials stationed armored cars along several of
Bogota's main avenues and beefed up army checkpoints. Police and
army troops remained on alert as President Virgilio Barco consulted
with his security advisers.
   ``Naturally we've taken security measures to prevent any kind of
retaliation,'' Interior Minister Carlos Lemos said in a radio
interview.
   The head of Colombia's investigative police, Gen. Miguel Maza
Marquez, told a news conference late Friday that terrorism might
even increase as a result of Rodriguez Gacha's death. He called the
killing a triumph for the government, but said the drug war was far
from won.
   Officials blame traffickers for 203 bombings that have killed
199 people since the drug lords declared ``total war'' on the
government last August in retaliation for Barco's policy of
extraditing drug suspects to the United States.
   Maza said authorities are pursuing Colombia's top drug baron,
Pablo Escobar, with renewed optimism after their success in
tracking down Rodriguez Gacha, who had been considered among
Colombia's most ruthless criminals.
   At Marigot, St. Martin, President Bush on Saturday hailed the
Colombian government's action as a ``courageous effort.''
   ``I was delighted yesterday when the Colombian government
brought to bay the _ I think the man who is ranked the third most
prominent narco terrorist in Colombia _ Mr. Gacha,'' Bush said
during a news conference after meeting in the Caribbean with French
President Francois Mitterrand.
   Earlier in the week, Bush announced he would travel to Colombia
next year for a drug summit despite security concerns. The United
States has backed the Colombian crackdown on drug traffickers.
   Also Saturday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, returning
from the Caribbean with Bush, said the president did not make a
telephone call to Barco to congratulate him after the shootout. A
spokesman for the presidential palace told The Associated Press on
Friday that Bush had made such a call.
   Authorities revealed new details Saturday about the manhunt that
resulted in the death of Rodriguez Gacha, his 17-year-old son
Freddy, and five bodyguards near the port of Covenas, 360 miles
north of Bogota.
   The manhunt began last month after a raid on one of Escobar's
hideouts, according to a communique released by the Sucre state
police, whose members participated in the search.
   Police said Escobar was on his farm near Cocorna, 125 miles
north of Bogota, when they raided it Nov. 22. Escobar escaped, but
police found documents that gave them information about Rodriguez
Gacha's movements, the communique said.
   Authorities tracked the trafficker to a rural area between
Covenas and the town of Tolu.
   The communique said a police helicopter spotted Rodriguez Gacha
and his entourage fleeing in a truck.
   ``Initially they wanted to shelter themselves on a farm called
Tolugas,'' the communique said. ``Later they split up, fled to
different sites, and attacked police following them with grenades
and firearms.''
   The communique said police were forced to shoot back, killing
all seven of the suspects. Rodriguez Gacha's body was found
gripping a submachine gun, emptied in the battle, the report said.
   It did little to clear up conflicting versions of how police
discovered Rodriguez Gacha's whereabouts.
   Bogota's La Prensa newspaper, quoting a reporter who accompanied
police on the raid, said authorities located the trafficker last
Wednesday in the port city of Cartagena, where he was meeting with
Freddy.
   Other officials reportedly said Freddy, who was captured over
three months ago, was let out of jail intentionally on Nov. 23 so
that police could follow him to his father.
   La Prensa quoted the reporter as saying police lost track of
Rodriguez Gacha when, aware that they were looking for him, he fled
the city in a small boat bound for Covenas.
   The owner of the boat later told police of the trafficker's
whereabouts in an effort to earn the $581,000 reward offered by the
government for information leading to his capture, La Prensa said.
It identified its source as Silvio Cohen, a correspondent for
Barranquilla's El Heraldo newspaper.
   El Tiempo, Colombia's leading daily, quoted a police official as
saying authorities had acted on information provided by farmers in
the area.
   A Bogota police spokesman, reached by telephone, said he could
neither confirm nor deny any of the versions.
   La Prensa reported that Rodriguez Gacha killed himself with a
hand grenade after being surrounded by police, but an official
coroner's report said Rodriguez Gacha and the other men died from
bullet wounds to the head and body.
   Rodriguez Gacha was the second most important leader of the
Medellin cartel, which together with a rival group from the
southern city of Cali is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine
sold on U.S. streets.
   The other cartel leaders are Escobar and Jorge Luis Ochoa.
   Rodriguez Gacha was perhaps the most ruthless of the three.
Authorities blamed the billionaire trafficker for hundreds of
deaths of political leaders, judges, journalists and farmers.
   Maza, the investigative police chief, accused him of contracting
the Aug. 18 killing of Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential
candidate whose killing provoked the latest government crackdown.

<TEXT>
   A British newspaper reported Sunday that police
have enough evidence to charge several suspects in the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 a year ago.
   The Sunday Times of London said Scottish investigators told a
secret five-nation meeting of security services that under Scottish
law ``charges are now possible against certain persons.''
   The weekly did not say when the meeting took place, identify the
source of information for its story, or give further details about
the number or identities of the alleged suspects.
   It said leaders of security services in Britain, West Germany,
the United States, Sweden and Malta attended the meeting in
Meckenheim, West Germany.
   The Sunday Times said police heading the investigation told the
meeting that because of extradition obstacles, some suspects might
have to be tried abroad.
   New York-bound Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, West Germany,
changed planes in London and was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   Lord Frazer, Scotland's senior law officer, on Friday announced
results of the first public inquiry into the bombing but said
criminal proceedings were not imminent.
   He said Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, a radical Palestinian organization, was
among groups under investigation. Jibril has denied any involvement.
   The Sunday Times said police ``have for some time suspected who
the killers are, but the painstaking assembly of evidence has been
a long task.''
   It added police probably will wait until their inquiries are
completed in three or four months before starting criminal
proceedings.
   Frazer, in an interview published in the Edinburgh weekly
Scotland on Sunday, said any trial in the case almost certainly
would take place in the United States.
   Frazer, Scotland's lord advocate, told the newspaper that
Scotland would not compete with the United States to extradite
suspects held in other countries. The paper reported he said
Scotland would arrange a trial only if a country holding a suspect
refused a U.S. extradition request because the United States has
the death penalty.
   ``If, on the other hand, the United States was in that position
to secure extradition when the United Kingdom couldn't, I want
these people brought to justice and I wouldn't stand in the way of
anything,'' he was quoted as saying.

   Frances Hammer, wife of industrialist Armand
Hammer, died Saturday morning of pneumonia after undergoing surgery
for a broken hip, a spokesman for Occidental Petroleum Corp. said.
She was 87.
   Mrs. Hammer died at the University of California-Los Angeles
Medical Center, said Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley. Hammer, 91,
was at the medical center when she died, Ashley said.
   She was a constant companion and adviser to her husband for the
past 33 years, accompanying him as he pursued philanthropic and
business interests as chairman of Occidental. She also helped
Hammer in his effort to find a cure for cancer.
   Mrs. Hammer was a painter, supported the arts and was involved
in several civic and charitable activities, Ashley said.
   The Chicago native and Hammer were married in January 1956. It
was his third marriage and her second.
   Mrs. Hammer was a co-founder of the International Student Center
at the University of California-Los Angeles, with Neil Jacoby,
former dean of UCLA's School of Biology.
   She also served on the Campobello International Park Commission,
which oversees the U.S. and Canadian International Peace Park at
the retreat of former President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hammer
bought the retreat and gave it to the governments of both countries.
   Mrs. Hammer was a charter member of the board of directors of
the Armand Hammer United World College of the American West in
Montezuma, N.M. She participated in conferences on international
peace and human rights sponsored by Hammer.
   In 1981, she was honored in Los Angeles by the American Women
for International Understanding, of which she was a member. She was
also a member of the Blue Ribbon 400 support group for the Los
Angeles Music Center.
   She is survived by three sisters, a niece and two grand nephews.
   The Hammers had no children. Funeral services were to be private.

   A producer hoping to capitalize on Zsa
Zsa Gabor's police-slapping exploits said Saturday he has cast the
former Hungarian beauty queen to play the mother of Saudi Arabia's
founder in a $50 million film epic.
   The film will chronicle Saudi Arabia from the time of King
Abdel-Aziz ibn Saud, who united the desert kingdom in 1932, to the
present, said Chris Christianson, president of A Major Motion
Picture Co.
   Christianson said Mohammed al-Fassi, an oil-rich Saudi sheik,
agreed recently to bankroll the film, which is scheduled to begin
production in January.
   Al-Fassi made headlines in the early 1980s for a spate of
controversies linked to his enormous wealth and jet-set lifestyle.
   In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected al-Fassi's appeal of a
more than $77 million divorce settlement. Two years earlier,
al-Fassi's former neighbors in Beverly Hills hoisted glasses of
champagne as a demolition crew leveled a the sheik's fire-ravaged
mansion, which had featured flesh-tone nude statues with
red-painted genitalia.
   Dozens of cats now roam outside al-Fassi's Miami Beach mansion
following his recent decision to set aside $2.5 million to save the
nation's stray felines.
   Mrs. Gabor was scheduled to appear with the sheik at his $3.2
million bayside mansion to announce the film, but she canceled when
her luggage was lost during a flight from Los Angeles, Christianson
said.
   ``She just can't go out to K mart and pick up a dress,''
Christianson said. ``Off-the-rack is just not her.''
   Mrs. Gabor was convicted Sept. 29 of misdemeanor charges for
slapping a Beverly Hills policeman after he pulled over her
Rolls-Royce. She has been sentenced to 72 hours in jail and fines
totaling $2,937, pending an appeal.
   Mrs. Gabor did not return telephone calls Saturday to her room
at The Polo Club in Wellington, about 60 miles north of Miami.
   Christianson, who described the film as ``an epic in the
tradition of Lawrence of Arabia,'' said publicity from Mrs. Gabor's
trial contributed to the casting decision.
   ``Certainly, she's hot right now,'' he said. ``She's an unusual
lady. There's a certain character and flamboyance in all the Gabor
sisters.''
   The role would be a departure for Mrs. Gabor, whose previous
screen appearances were in B movies like ``Queen of Outer Space''
and ``Picture Mommy Dead.''
   Al-Fassi said he wants to educate Western viewers about his
native land and push for democratic reforms there, similar to those
in Eastern Europe.
   ``We do not have a democracy in Saudi Arabia and there are many
problems. We want to instruct people about the royal family and
what they've done to the country,'' al-Fassi said.
   The film, tentatively titled ``A Whisper in the Wind,'' could be
ready for distribution by the end of 1990, Christianson said.

   Actor Lee Van Cleef, whose steely eyes and
rugged features led to a long career portraying Western
arch-villains, died early Saturday after collapsing at home,
authorities said. He was 64.
   Van Cleef's film break came as one of the desperadoes faced down
by Gary Cooper in the 1952 movie ``High Noon,'' and he became a
familiar gunslinger in so-called spaghetti Westerns made by Italian
director Sergio Leone, including ``The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.''
   Van Cleef collapsed at his Oxnard home around 11:40 p.m. Friday
night, said Craig Stevens, a Ventura County deputy coroner.
   ``It's an apparent heart attack, Stevens said. ``He's got a
history of heart disease. He had a permanent pacemaker.''
   Van Cleef's film credits included another spaghetti Western,
``For a Few Dollars More,'' and the science-fiction thriller
``Escape From New York.''

   Silvana Mangano, the Italian actress whose
role as a sensual country girl in ``Bitter Rice'' made her a star,
died Saturday in a Madrid hospital after several days in a coma, a
hospital spokeswoman said. She was 59.
   Ms. Mangano went into the coma after she suffered a heart attack
during surgery for cancer. She had been suffering from cancer for
several years.
   The trained dancer, model and former Miss Rome played bit parts
until she landed the starring role in director Giuseppe De Santis'
1949 film ``Bitter Rice,'' considered one of best examples of the
postwar Italian neo-realism movement.
   In later years, her career was overshadowed by that of her
husband of 34 years, movie producer Dino De Laurentiis.

<HEAD>Bush: Time to Review Trade Restrictions to Warsaw Pact Nations</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Mitterrand</HEAD>

   President Bush on Saturday signalled
that his administration is ready to consider a major relaxation of
trade restrictions on high-technology exports to Warsaw Pact
nations.
   ``I think it is timely that we take a new look at the commercial
restraints,'' Bush said at a joint news conference on this
Caribbean island after meeting with French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   Bush made the comments when asked if he was willing to consider
relaxing the longstanding trade restraints in light of the recent
democratic movements sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Senior administration officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that the United States is willing to give a full
re-evaluation to East-West trade curbs that have multiplied over
the past 40 years.
   The re-evaluation mentioned by Bush would seek to separate items
that had real potential military applications from commercial items
that provide little realistic national security threat, the
officials said.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has been in the forefront of
the move to relax the trade restraints.
   Although these restrictions were designed to keep materials that
could have military application from finding their way to Soviet
bloc nations, critics contend they also impede shipment of hundreds
of consumer products _ ranging from home computers to even some
kitchen appliances _ that contain sophisticated electronic
components.
   European allies, including France, have been urging a relaxation
in these restrictions for some time _ in part because East bloc
nations have been able to freely buy the same goods from other
nations, particularly from Asian competitors.
   But the United States in the past has resisted any major
revamping of the system.
   And, even Saturday, Bush told reporters, ``There are still
legitimate national security interests that must be preserved and I
don't think we have one iota of difference with France on that.''
   The set of trade rules of what can be imported into Warsaw Pact
nations from the West is regulated by the Paris-based Coordinating
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or COCOM for short.
   This committee is made up of the United States, its NATO allies
and Japan.
   Bush's comments Saturday were the first public sign that the
United States is now willing to consider a major relaxation of the
trade restrictions.
   It previously granted most-favored nation status to Hungary,
supported a variety of economic incentives for Poland and agreed to
support the Soviet Union's longstanding application to participate
as an observer in an international trade forum, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

   A man accused of shootng a policeman to
death at a department store, commandeering a car and fleeing this
quiet farming community remained at large Saturday, the police
chief said.
   Officer Michael Hogan, 43, was killed by a single shot to the
head while interviewing a shoptlifting suspect Friday night.
   A second-degree murder complaint was filed Saturday against
Phillip Lewis Cole, 29, of Minneapolis, Steve Madson, chief of the
16-officer department, said at a news conference.
   Hogan, a 16-year veteran of the force, was called to the store
at 7:15 p.m. by a clerk who had detected a ``fraudulent scheme,''
Madson said. Merchandise that may have been stolen from the store
was being returned for cash, the chief said.
   While interviewing a man police identified as Cole in a private
office of the store, the officer was shot, Madson said, adding the
attack was witnessed by a store employee.
   The gunman ran from the store and ordered two motorists to drive
him to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, about 60 miles east of this
farming community of 10,000.
   The motorists weren't hurt, Madson said.
   Two women and a man who were arrested Saturday had ties to the
suspect, police said, but Madson declined to elaborate on that. The
three were being held pending possible charges, Madson said.
   Hogan was married and had three children. He was described as a
conscientious, well-liked officer and a lifelong Hutchinson
resident.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter met with
President Daniel Ortega on Saturday and praised the work of the
national council in charge of Nicaragua's elections set for Feb. 25.
   ``The Supreme Electoral Council is doing an excellent job, and
they deserve and need all the support of the different political
parties,'' Carter told a news conference.
   He heads a delegation invited by both the leftist Sandinista
government and the opposition to observe preparations for the
election of a president, national assembly and municipal officials.
   Carter said Mariano Fiallos, the electoral council president,
would issue an order this weekend designed to avoid the violence
that occurred during a Dec. 10 opposition rally in the town of
Masatepe, 30 miles southeast of Managua. One person was killed, and
20 were injured.
   Most political parties are aware of the planned order, he said,
but he gave no details and there was no announcement from the
council.
   ``Even if they (the political parties) do not agree with it,
they are going to have to abide by it, because it is an official
order that has the force of law,'' Carter added.
   The Sandinistas and leaders of the United National Opposition
have accused each other of provoking the Masatepe clashes, the most
violent in the two-month-old election campaign.
   Agustin Jarquin, head of the opposition Democratic Party of
National Confidence, criticized Carter's support of the council. He
said Carter is naive in believing the council president is
independent of the left-wing government.
   Ortega said he told Carter that he shared his concern about the
violence in Masatepe.
   Carter arrived Wednesday accompanied by his wife Rosalynn;
former Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash.; and former Costa Rican President
Daniel Oduber. They left Saturday for Costa Rica.

   Temperatures plunged to record lows Saturday from the Midwest to
the Mexican border as north winds held sway while a storm that
dropped more than a foot of snow made travel difficult in New
England by land and by air.
   Thirteen deaths in seven states since Thursday night were blamed
on the weather. Blowing snow also disrupted an aerial search for a
missing private plane in New York, and ice and snow covered roads
from Kentucky to New England. Cold forced postponement of a
candlelight commemoration at a Civil War battleground in Maryland.
   Police said they were busy with fender-benders, but less so with
crime.
   ``When it's this cold, even the weasels stay inside,'' said Sgt.
Will Connelly in Omaha, Neb., where the low was 11 degrees below
zero.
   The National Weather Service said even though the cold was less
numbing Saturday than it had been Friday in the Midwest, a fresh
supply of arctic air was on its way Sunday.
   ``Cold,'' forecaster Mike Wolf in Chicago said, summing up the
Illinois forecast in one chilling word. ``Monday through Wednesday.
There's no break in sight. Cold.''
   In Bloomington, Ill., the temperature was 7 degrees below zero
but the wind-chill index made it feel like 44 below.
   Farther south, the wind chill in Kentucky was 10 to 20 below,
keeping roads in state's southeast icy. Lows around Tennessee were
mostly in the single digits early Saturday and were generally about
30 degrees below normal.
   Record temperatures for the date were set or tied in more than
50 cities in 17 states, including 8 below zero in St. Louis; 16
below in Salina and 15 below in Topeka, Kan.; 15 below in Sioux
City, Iowa; and 16 below in Lincoln and 11 below in Omaha, Neb.
   The freeze caused a massive ice jam along a 35-mile stretch of
the Missouri River north of Omaha, dropping waters downstream to
critically low levels, the National Weather Service said.
   Other records included 2 degrees in Nashville; minus 6 at
Lexington and minus 4 at Paducah, Ky., and Louisville; and zero in
Parkersburg and minus 2 degrees in Beckley, W.Va. A low of 8
degrees in Memphis, Tenn., was a plunge of 40 degrees below the
high reported Friday.
   Records in Texas included 9 degrees in Abilene, 11 at Waco, 12
at Midland and the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, 17 at Austin and San
Antonio, 19 at Houston, 24 at Corpus Christi and 33 at Brownsville,
the state's southernmost town on the Mexican border.
   Even Honolulu had a record low: 56 degrees Saturday morning,
only three degrees above the all-time record low.
   A candlelight ceremony scheduled for Saturday evening at
Antietam National Battlefield near Sharpsburg, Md., was postponed
until Sunday. The wind chill was expected to be 25 to 30 degrees
below zero. Organizers planned to light 23,110 candles, one for
each soldier killed, wounded or missing after the Civil War's
bloodiest single-day battle.
   Morning flights out of Portland, Maine, were delayed by limited
visibility. ``The runway was there and available, but the vis was
down to zip for a while,'' said airport manager Barry Valentine.
   Snow was falling heavily in parts of New England in the early
afternoon, with 13 inches already recorded in parts of New
Hampshire and more than a foot in northeast Vermont.
   High winds and blowing snow forced an end to an aerial search
for a twin-engine plane carrying six people that disappeared late
Friday south of Albany, N.Y., said Ann MacMillan, spokeswoman for
the Civil Air Patrol.
   Some parts of upstate New York had their first heavy snow in two
years, ranging up to 11 inches in the southern Adirondacks about 60
miles north of Albany.
   More than 8 inches of snow fell in the Rochester area overnight,
and lake-effect snow continued falling Saturday afternoon, National
Weather Service meteorologist Kim Bolam said.
   ``Probably in areas where there are squalls we'll get another 2
to 4 inches,'' she said.
   Plumbers, wrecker services and ski area businesses said the
weather brought cold cash.
   ``It's like a Christmas gift a week early,'' said spokeswoman
Nancy Marshall at Sugarloaf USA in Maine's Carrabassett Valley.
``People are still coming in and it's been reasonably busy
considering how bad the driving has been.''
   Deaths blamed on the weather since Thursday night numbered three
in Illinois, two in Indiana, four in Missouri, and one each in New
York, Ohio, Wyoming and Connecticut.
   All were in traffic accidents except in St. Louis, where the
body of an 88-year-old woman was found Saturday in a yard less than
a block from her home and a 62-year-old man was found dead in a
shed behind a store. On Friday, one man had a fatal heart attack
shoveling snow and another died after being found covered with snow
in an alley.

   Actor Lee Van Cleef, whose steely eyes and
hawklike features won him a long career portraying arch-villains in
western movies, died early Saturday, apparently of a heart attack,
authorities said. He was 64.
   Van Cleef's film break came when he was cast as one of four
desperadoes faced down by Gary Cooper in the 1952 movie ``High
Noon.'' He became a familiar gunslinger in so-called spaghetti
Westerns made by Italian director Sergio Leone, including ``The
Good, the Bad and the Ugly.''
   Among his hundreds of black-hat roles were parts in ``How The
West Was Won,'' ``The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' and ``Death
Rides a Horse.''
   Van Cleef collapsed at his Oxnard home around 11:40 p.m. Friday
night, said Craig Stevens, a Ventura County deputy coroner. The
coastal community is about 60 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The actor's wife, Barbara, called paramedics and he was taken to
St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, where he was
pronounced dead at 12:04 a.m., Stevens said.
   ``It's an apparent heart attack,'' Stevens said. ``He's got a
history of heart disease. He had a permanent pacemaker.''
   In 1969, Van Cleef jokingly attributed his gunslinger casting in
some 350 television movies and motion pictures to his predator's
nose.
   ``I didn't speak a word in `High Noon,''' he recalled. ``In 1951
Stanley and Earl Kramer saw me in a play. `Mr. Roberts,' and
offered me the role eventually played by Lloyd Bridges in the film,
providing I would have my nose fixed. I refused and wound up as one
of the four villains.''
   ``Now,people remember this beak,'' he said.
   Born in 1925 of Dutch ancestry in Somerville, N.J., Van Cleef
dropped out of high school to join the Navy, where he served on
submarine chasers and minesweepers. He was discharged in 1946.
   He worked several odd jobs as a farmer, gas station attendant
and painter before getting his first stage role in a production of
``Our Town'' by an amateur troupe in Clinton, N.J.
   New York producer and director Harold Anderson noticed Van Cleef
in an amateur production of ``Heaven Can Wait,'' and helped find
him a place in the road company production of the World War II Navy
comedy, ``Mr. Roberts,'' with Henry Fonda.
   Van Cleef spent 14 months on the road with ``Mr. Roberts''
before making his first film appearance in ``High Noon.''
   His film career had stalled when he was recruited by Leone to
play in the 1965 Western, ``For a Few Dollars More,'' starring
Clint Eastwood as the man with no name.
   Van Cleef changed hats for his role in the film, playing what he
called ``a non-angelic sort of character who's still on the side of
the law.''
   In the follow-up film, ``The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,''
however, Van Cleef returned to his villainous roots, playing
opposite Eastwood and Eli Wallach. He also appeared in the
science-fiction thriller ``Escape From New York.''
   Van Cleef's extended work in Italy and Europe may have hurt his
career, said his agent, Tom Jennings.
   ``I think he could have been a greater movie star, as big as
Charles Bronson or Clint Eastwood, had he come back from Europe
sooner than he did. But he liked working abroad,'' Jennings said.
``He wasn't the ambitious killer-type star, always going after the
gold ring. He did his own thing.''
   His last television project was NBC's 1984 series ``The
Master,'' where he played an Air Force colonel who becomes a Ninja
martial arts expert in post-World War II Japan.
   Van Cleef had three children by his first marriage to Patsy Ruth
Van Cleef.

   Police who tracked down and killed a
powerful leader of the Medellin drug cartel called the slaying a
``splendid Christmas present,'' but warned that drug terrorism
could rise as a result.
   Hours after Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, his 17-year-old son Fredy
and five bodyguards were killed in a hail of gunfire Friday,
authorities pledged to hunt down Pablo Escobar, Colombia's cocaine
godfather and its most-wanted criminal.
   President Bush called President Virgilio Barco to congratulate
him and the country's security forces for eliminating Rodriguez
Gacha, who has been implicated in hundreds of murders of
politicians, judges and peasants.
   The operation was by far the biggest success of Barco's
16-week-old war on drug traffickers. Authorities said Gacha
Rodriguez in fact had ordered the Aug. 18 assassination of a
leading presidential candidate, the slaying that sparked the
government's crackdown on traffickers.

   A federal safety official says a consumer
group is misleading the public by criticizing child safety seats
when in fact they are the ``single most effective safety device
ever developed for an automobile.''
   Jeffrey Miller, deputy administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, attacked the Center for Auto Safety
after the group issued a report Friday declaring that millions of
children are riding in unsafe child restraint seats.
   Center director Clarence Ditlow said more than half of the 27
million child car seats sold over the last eight years are ``in use
despite being recalled or failing compliance tests.''
   The center and parents of children killed or injured in
allegedly defective child restraint seats blamed the federal safety

   Range wars are nothing new to ranchers, but
hit-and-run vandalism that the FBI blames on environmental
terrorists is igniting new conflict in the West.
   ``It's a case of ecological terrorism,'' FBI agent Richard
Whitaker said of a growing number of incidents, including
castration of cattle, sabotage of farm machinery, freeing of farm
animals and possibly death threats against a rancher and a
government animal manager.
   ``Their basic goal is to eradicate the rancher,'' Whitaker said.
   The attacks have become more prevalent in Nevada, California and
Arizona in recent months. Some ranchers say damage they previously
thought was the work of pranksters or hunters may be a concerted
effort by animal rights activists and environmental groups.

   As they try to sort out the outlook for
investing and the economy in the 1990s, Wall Street analysts have
grown increasingly edgy in recent days about the national real
estate market.
   Some of the concern surfaces in generalities _ for instance,
about the possibility that the long boom in residential real estate
dating back into the 1960s might have peaked.
   But it has also manifested itself in stock-market specifics.
Shares of many regional banks with big commitments to real estate
loans, and of the large national home mortgage companies, have been
falling sharply or at least lagging conspicuously of late.
   ``It seems that regional banks are in the headlines as
frequently as the big money center institutions recently,'' says
the Value Line Investment Survey in a just-published report on the
banking outlook.
   ``The reason is that problems with real estate loans are
surfacing, particularly in the Northeast, Southeast and Southwest.
   ``Cities as distant and different as Boston and Phoenix fell
victim to euphoria with regard to population and business growth in
the `80s,'' says Value Line analyst Theresa Brophy.
   ``On the real estate front, we're not sure that the worst is
over. Slower economic growth in the year ahead might cause other
markets to weaken.''
   Of course, the ``national'' real estate market is really made up
of many diverse local markets where conditions vary dramatically.
   In the Southwestern ``oil patch,'' real estate suffered a
well-publicized bust in the 1980s even as prices of properties in
some other parts of the country kept climbing.
   Through the industrial and agricultural Midwest as well,
property values suffered from adverse economic conditions.
   In some of those areas, speculation now focuses on the chances
for a rebound from depressed levels.
   But an overall slowdown of late in the rise of real estate
prices has nevertheless stirred worries among analysts who have
been wondering what debt problems might arise in any kind of
national business slump.
   Those concerns intensified on Friday when the Bank of New
England in Boston announced increases in its loan-loss reserve and
non-performing assets, and said it would report a substantial loss
for the year.
   An accompanying drop in stock prices overall Friday left the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials at 2,739.55, up 8.11 from the week
before.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index up .53 at 193.45; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market down 12.38 at 443.84, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index up .55 at 193.47.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 185.54 million shares a day,
against 151.55 million the week before.
   Many optimists on the economic outlook pin their hopes on
declining interest rates to support the real estate market, by
lowering mortgage rates for buyers and allowing at least some
existing homeowners to refinance at lower costs.
   The Federal Reserve is not confronted with a sharply declining
economy, said Richard Rippe at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., ``but
there are no grounds for complacency either.
   ``The weakening signs are very clear and they do imply a risk of
recession,'' Rippe maintained.
   ``With wage and industrial price pressures moderate, inflation
should not be a major obstacle. Consequently, we expect further
moves toward ease over the next few months. The Federal Reserve
will want some additional insurance against the cumulation of
downward pressures.''

<TEXT>
   Lee Iacocca, T. Boone Pickens and Robert Campeau
swaggered triumphantly through most the 1980s, admired, feared and
envied for their business brilliance, wealth and foresight.
   But the baying bloodhounds of economic reality treed them this
past week, the latest examples of how a weakening economy, borrowed
money and strategic blunders have humbled some of the decade's
biggest financial celebrities.
   Iacocca, the Chrysler Corp. chairman who led the rescue of the
No. 3 automaker from failure in the late 1970s, once was hailed as
a national hero. When he announced early repayment of government
bailout loans in 1983, Iacocca boasted: ``We at Chrysler borrow
money the old fashioned way. We pay it back.''
   But over the past several months Chrysler's financial
performance has deteriorated sharply and forced the company into a
severe retreat because of brutal competition and the declining
demand for cars and trucks.
   In July, Iacocca proclaimed a $1 billion cost-cutting program.
Earlier this month, he scrapped a diversification plan and
announced plans to sell Chrysler's aerospace division to raise more
money.
   This past week, Chrysler announced big rebates to unload
backlogs of cars and trucks. But the most telling element of the
strategy was its first-ever rebates on minivans, formerly one of
the automaker's most popular sellers, capturing more than half the
market. Now Chrysler is fighting to hold even part of that in the
face of rivals from Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and Japan.
   For Pickens, the takeover strategist who epitomized the 1980s
corporate raider and often denounced target companies for
mismanagement, this past week offered what critics called a
sobering lesson in how he mismanaged his own.
   The Mesa Limited Partnership, Pickens' energy company,
eliminated cash distributions to its unit holders _ the equivalent
of eliminating dividend payments to shareholders _ and announced
asset sales to repay debts, including an interest in its prized
Kansas natural gas field.
   Pickens said the steps were necessary because of an unexpectedly
prolonged depression in the price of natural gas, Mesa's most
important source of earnings.
   But it was considered an ironic retreat by an outspoken defender
of shareholder rights. Pickens had been borrowing money and using
profits from his own takeover forays to maintain the cash
distributions to Mesa's constituents.
   For Campeau, whose multibillion dollar string of debt-financed
takeovers gave him an enormous retailing empire, the past week was
a Christmas reminder that there's no Santa Claus when creditors
call.
   The Canadian investor, forced to put his crown jewel
Bloomingdale's stores up for sale in September because of trouble
repaying debts, disclosed that he was having even more trouble
despite an emergency cash infusion from lenders.
   The announcement seemed to suggest that even the crucial holiday
selling season might not tide over many of Campeau's cash-starved
stores. It jolted the already weak market for high-yield junk bond
debt that Campeau and other big takeover investors have sold to
finance their expansions in the 1980s.
   It also raised the prospect that Campeau might put part of his
holdings under bankruptcy court protection from creditors, and by
the end of the week that possibility seemed more like a
self-fulfilling prophecy.
   Heller Financial Inc., one of the nation's biggest lenders in
the retailing industry, said it no longer would extend credit to
suppliers of Campeau's stores.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Chrysler wasn't the only automaker facing problems. All of the
Big Three and several foreign competitors announced slow U.S. sales
and some suggested they would have to idle thousands of workers
unless orders picked up. The sluggishness spread to Europe, where
Sweden's troubled Saab-Scania AB said it would sell a half interest
in its passenger car-building business to GM.
   _Most government statistics suggested much slower economic
growth, giving the Federal Reserve more flexibility to lower
interest rates. Industrial production barely grew in November,
wholesale prices fell, business inventories expanded in October and
sales fell. But the trade deficit for October surged nearly 20
percent from a month earlier, suggesting that America's appetite
for foreign goods remains unabated.
   _Prosecutors notched another courtroom victory in the Ivan
Boesky insider trading scandal, showing that juries increasingly
are willing to convict wealthy defendants in complex securities
fraud cases. GAF Corp. and its vice chairman James T. Sherwin were
found guilty of stock manipulation.
