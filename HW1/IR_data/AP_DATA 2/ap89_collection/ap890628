   President Bush, an avid baseball fan, took his
13-year-old grandson and the budget director to an American League
Baseball game Wednesday at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium.
   The president and grandson George P. Bush stayed through six
innings of an evening game between the first-place Baltimore Orioles
and third-place Toronto Blue Jays. With them were Budget Director
Richard Darman and his son, Willie, also 13.
   The presidential party left with the score tied 1-1 in the top of
the seventh. The Orioles won it, 2-1.
   Bush and his party sat in a sky box over home plate with Orioles'
owner Eli Jacobs. Bush took off his suitcoat and tie and waved to
the crowd at the beginning of the game.
   The president, who keeps his first-baseman's glove in his Oval
Office desk, was captain of Yale's baseball team in 1948, his senior
year.
   Bush threw out the first ball when he and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak attended the April 3 season opener between the Orioles
and the Boston Red Sox. This trip, the White House said, Bush was
expected to merely watch the game from a sky box.
   Young George, the son of Jeb and Columba Bush, has been staying
at the White House for several weeks.

   A quiet revolution is taking root behind
the soft whir of sewing machines where Bangladeshi women are finding
alternatives to poverty, early marriage and frequent childbirth.
   In this underfed, overpopulated, disaster-prone nation, the
garment industry has established itself as a success story both
economically and socially.
   Nahar was 12 years old when her family arranged her marriage to a
bicycle-rickshaw puller who, she said, beat her. By the age of 16,
she was a deserted wife with an infant son.
   Traditionally, the only respectable options for a poor village
girl like Nahar would have been remarriage or becoming a maid. The
other possibilities in Bangladesh's limited female labor market were
husking rice, pounding bricks and stones into gravel at construction
sites, or prostitution.
   Instead, a few months after Nahar's husband cast her out in 1985,
a relative offered her a job in the fledgling garment industry.
   Today, at the age of 20, she is a sewing machine operator at Y.K.
Garments on Elephant Road in the center of Dhaka and sends half her
monthly salary of 900 takas (about $28) home to her mother in the
village to take care of her 5-year-old son. Her annual salary of
$336 is more than double the country's per capita annual income of
$160.
   ``I feel I'm the happiest woman on earth,'' she said. ``No one
beats me anymore almost every night. I'm independent and I earn my
own money.''
   Like many Bangladeshis, she goes only by her first name, Nahar,
and does not use her last.
   Such independence is still rare for most Bangladeshi women, but
it is a beginning and it is growing.
   About 300,000 women work in Bangladesh's clothing factories,
making up 90 percent of the industry's work force. The number of
export-oriented clothing factories swelled from four in 1979 to 722
in 1988, according to government statistics.
   Export earnings shot up from $500,000 in 1979 to $450 million in
1988 and now bring in 35 percent of the nation's foreign exchange.
   Today Bangladesh is the fifth-largest exporter of ready-made
clothing to the United States, after Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan
and China, according to the U.S. Embassy.
   But the garment industry could help in another problem area _
population growth _ if more women choose to work and marry later,
thereby reducing their child-bearing years.
   Bangladesh is the world's most densely populated land after the
city-states of Hong Kong and Singapore. If its birth rate is not
checked, its population of 110 million will double within 35 years.
According to UNICEF, 86 percent of the population already lives
below the poverty level.
   Ayesha Khatoon, daughter of a landless peasant in Bangladesh's
northern Rangpur district, was 11 when she fled to Dhaka in 1984
because her parents planned to marry her off to a 16-year-old boy.
   ``I did not want the marriage,'' she said. ``The job at the
garment factory has saved my life. Otherwise I would have ended up
either being a maid at a rich man's house or, who knows, in a
brothel.''
   Ayesha and three of her co-workers at Meghna Garments Industry
Ltd. share a one-room, tin-roofed apartment. That in itself is a
social breakthrough in a country where single women are expected to
live with their families.
   One of her roommates, 25-year-old Khodeza, said she left her
husband two years ago because he insisted they have a fifth child.
The first four were girls, and he wanted a son.
   ``One night I thought and thought. Suddenly I decided that I
can't take it anymore. I must leave for a life of my own,'' Khodeza
said.
   ``The garment women have achieved a great social revolution in
our conservative Moslem society,'' said Sufia Kamal, a women's
rights activist and leading poet. ``They have done what many of us
educated women have failed to achieve so far. Although the women are
taking the jobs out of necessity, they are also silently fighting
against the social taboos.''

<DATELINE>WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newspaper in this middle-of-the-road
Philadelphia suburb has drawn sharply divided opinions about its new
type of human interest feature _ stories about dead pets.
   They aren't obituaries, exactly, according to staffers at the
West Chester Daily Local News, daily circulation 40,000. They're
more like stories of the pets' lives and the people they lived with.
   Though it sounds like a ``dog days'' sort of thing to fill space
in the paper, of little real notice except maybe to the owners of
the pets being remembered, the project has proved controversial.
   ``It seems to have hit some nerve,'' said city editor David
Warner, who tried the idea out first with a story about a rooster
that flew the coop and died.
   He expanded it last month into a weekly feature called ``Pause to
Remember,'' which now contains up to a half-dozen dead pet stories,
mostly about dogs. Some have suggested ``Paws to Remember.''
   ``Many people think the stories are terrific, and many think they
are horrible and not serious journalism,'' Warner said. ``There is
nobody in between. It's either good or bad.
   ``But the key point is that I like it, and my boss (Editor James
Sneddon) likes it, and that's why it's continuing, and I think going
OK.''
   The Wall Street Journal even wrote about the new feature and got
reaction from other journalists.
   ``I have enough trouble finding space for the people,'' Irvin
Horowitz, obituary editor for The New York Times, told the Journal.
Richard Pearson, who reports on important deaths for the Washington
Post, had a similar view.
   Eugene Roberts, president and executive editor of the
Philadelphia Inquirer, told the Journal there's nothing like it in
his newspaper and ``we have no plans to in the foreseeable future,
by which I mean in my lifetime.''
   Warner insists what he's printing aren't obituaries. They are
stories ``about pets and the people who loved them, and that's what
human interest items in newspapers are normally about. So why is
that wrong?''
   ``I understand that some people really feel strongly that the
paper should be about more serious things,'' Warner said. ``But we
print a lot of less serious things like astrology charts, comics,
advice to the lovelorn and comments about sex.''
   The pets profiled have included Seagrave, a Dalmatian who liked
to ride a fire truck; Molly, a Siberian husky who befriended an
Alzheimer's disease victim; Butch, a Manx cat who played with cards
in a hat, or Chipper, a guinea pig who once was the best of show at
a 4-H Club meet.
   ``Recently a story told about two dogs in one family: Teenier was
blind and Missie led her around like a Seeing Eye dog for a dog, and
both died within four months of each other,'' Warner said. ``We
thought that was interesting.''
   Even in the paper's newsroom there was disagreement.
   Sports writer Dave Spadaro said he felt the stories ``went
against everything we were taught in journalism school. It may be
entertainment, but people thought it hurt the paper's credibility.
It was kind of a slap in the face of intelligence.''
   Judith Capar, assistant city editor, said she was skeptical in
the beginning, but has been ``pleasantly surprised at the outcome.''
   ``What we are doing are stories about people's relationships with
their pets, and these stories are heart-warming and touching,''
Capar said.
   The pet stories are written by James Giuliano, a part-time
reporter.
   He said he has found the assignment a real challenge, and
besides, ``These aren't hurting anyone.''

<HEAD>Oregonians Approve Export Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oregonians voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to
keep Oregon logs at home to preserve mill jobs rather than allow
them to be shipped overseas for premium prices.
   With 8 percent of precincts reporting in unofficial returns,
Measure 2 was passing 43,263, or 92 percent, to 3,701, or 8 percent.
   The measure will amend the state constitution to keep logs cut
from state-owned forests at home for processing, but Congress would
have to adopt enabling legislation before the export ban could go
into effect.
   ``This is the greatest present Oregon could give me trying to get
this bill through,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
   The measure also calls on Congress to permanently ban the export
of logs grown on national forests and other federal timberlands. The
Bush administration has proposed lifting the annual ban on exporting
federal logs to boost revenue by an estimated $200 million.
   Financing for the $800,000 campaign came largely from
non-exporting timber companies afraid that failure of the measure
could have led to a lifting of the ban on federal log exports.
   Federal logs are already in short supply because of court
injunctions barring timber sales in old growth forests that are
critical to the survival of the rare Northern spotted owl.
   The measure drew no organized opposition, but the Pacific Rim
Trade Association complained that supporters have misled the public
about the threat of state log exports to domestic mill jobs.
   Working through the association, large log exporters such as
Weyerhaeuser Co. have concentrated their efforts on Congress, where
they were successful last year in scuttling a bill to allow states
to ban exports of logs grown on state lands.
   The U.S. Forest Service has estimated that federal exports could
send an additional 1 billion board feet of raw timber from Oregon
and Washington forests to Japan, China and Korea.
   About 1.3 billion board feet of Oregon logs, primarily cut on
private lands, were shipped last year out of a statewide harvest of
9 billion board feet.
   Of the state forest harvest of 220 million board feet, about half
was exported.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Australian Prime Minister
Robert Hawke have agreed to disagree over U.S. grain subsidies,
officials said Tuesday.
   The dispute, in which Australia claims it is harmed by U.S.
subsidies to domestic growers, surfaced as Bush formally welcomed
Hawke to the White House.
   ``It is precisely because of the depth and the maturity of our
relationship that the difference of views ... can be faced openly
and honestly, for example, on some trade matters _ particularly
aspects of agricultural policy,'' Hawke said in his opening remarks.
   ``I am quite confident that today we will be able to focus on
ways to minimize, if not entirely resolve, such differences.''
   Acting Assistant Secretary of State William Clark said Bush and
Hawke later agreed they would work through the ongoing trade
liberalization talks in Geneva to eliminate export subsidies, such
as the ones the United States has for grain under its Export
Enhancement Program.
   The Bush administration wants to discontinue export subsidies,
but only in the context of those multinational talks, Clark said,
adding that Hawke ``is not making a demand right now that we do away
with it.''
   Hawke said Monday that although damage to Australia from the U.S.
policy has lessened over the past year, ``there remains a danger
that competitive export subsidization will again damage Australia
when grain surpluses re-emerge.''
   Clark said the United States doesn't believe its policy harms
Australia.
   The grain flap also arose during Vice President Dan Quayle's
recent visit to Australia, with Australians contending the subsidy
program has cut into their exports to other markets and gives the
U.S. growers an unfair price advantage.
   While disagreeing on grain subsidies, Bush and Hawke agreed on
what stance to take toward to China.
   Hawke said he and Bush had identical views deploring and
condemning ``the barbarism'' in China, but recognized that it is in
their strategic and economic interest not to cut off ties or take
measures that would reverse China's economic reforms.
   In an arrival ceremony, Bush said Australians and Americans share
a ``pioneer heritage in the taming of two vast continents, a
heritage of democratic ideas and a heritage of common sacrifice in
war and common efforts in peace.''
   Hawke later told a news conference Bush and Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter reacted very positively to his proposal to
strengthen the U.S. hand at the Geneva global trade talks by linking
next year's U.S. farm legislation to progress toward the goal
approved by both countries _ eventually eliminating farm subsidies.
   The prime minister said he suggested that the 1990 U.S. farm bill
include a provision that ``in the event of a positive outcome to the
Uruguay Round, then the provisions of the legislation would, in
fact, not come into effect.''
   Both Australia and America want to move toward abandoning farm
subsidies, so ``it makes sense to have within the (U.S.) legislation
... a position which coincides with that intention,'' Hawke said.
   And it would strengthen the bargaining position ``as you go into
those negotiations which are going to be hard, detailed and slogging
between now and the end of 1990,'' he added.
   Hawke said he and Bush ``both welcome unreservedly'' Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's reform policies, and that he backed
Bush's commitment ``that with appropriate caution, he will pursue
constructively every opportunity to build upon that attitude and
that approach of President Gorbachev.''
   Bush and Secretary of State James Baker had an ``overwhelmingly
positive'' response to Australia's initiative to organize regional
machinery for consultation on economic problems among the Pacific
basin countries, Hawke said. They agreed to work together in the
coming weeks for a regional consensus looking toward a ministerial
conference on it later this year, he added.
   The two countries disagreed, however, on U.S.-suggested arms aid
for the non-communist resistance in Cambodia and on Australia's
decision to press for a total ban on oil drilling and mining in
Antarctica, the prime minister said.
   ``There are so many positive elements'' favoring prospects for a
peaceful solution in Cambodia, that ``our judgment is that it's
better not to inject the element of lethal aid,'' Hawke said.
   At a state dinner in his honor at the White House, Hawke praised
Bush as a shrewd leader who has built on ``the courage of the
previous administration'' in promoting peace and moved to ``new
frontiers'' offering the greatest opportunities for peace since the
beginning of the nuclear age.
   ``It takes courage, it takes strength, it takes leadership. It
takes boldness to have done those things,'' Hawke said.
   Bush said the United States has an ``abiding commitment'' to
Australia.
   Referring to the troubles in China, he said that it was timely
for the two leaders to meet and consult on issues affecting the
region.
   ``Recent events in the Asia Pacific region showed that it is not
enough to let a man buy what he wants. He must be allowed to say
what he believes,'' Bush said in apparent reference to the economic
reforms in China contrasted with the brutal repression of
pro-democracy demonstrations.

<TEXT>
   With British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher pledging to defend her country's sovereign interests, a
rocky road still lies ahead for the 12-nation European Economic
Community as it moves toward closer economic and monetary union.
   But in the view of many participants at this week's EEC summit,
Mrs. Thatcher went a long way to shedding her image as the reluctant
European _ adopting a more conciliatory approach and making
concessions that just days ago seemed unthinkable.
   ``I give thanks for Mrs. Thatcher,'' Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez of Spain, who holds the community's rotating presidency,
said at the end of the two-day summit Tuesday.
   ``If you had asked me a week ago, I would not have believed that
this would have been possible.''
   After hours of hard bargaining marked by sharp exchanges between
Mrs. Thatcher and President Francois Mitterrand of France, the most
enthusiastic supporter of monetary union, the community agreed to
introduce on July 1, 1990 the initial stage of a program for closer
economic ties.
   Mrs. Thatcher succeeded in blocking an automatic transition that
would lead to a central bank and a single currency for the community.
   But she did not kill off the currency and bank proposals which
the two other largest community members of the community, France and
West Germany, regard as a key part of the drive toward a single
market. All trade barriers within the EEC are to be dismantled in
December 1992.
   Under the agreement that all the leaders endorsed, an
intergovernmental conference can be called by a simple majority any
time after July 1990 to vote on changes to the community's founding
charter.
   Such changes would be needed to set up the single central banking
system and currency.
   Mitterrand, who takes over the EEC presidency next month, says he
plans to call the intergovernmental conference next year, likely
forcing the showdown on close monetary integration.
   Community officials say the issue, by one means or another, is in
play.
   ``The movement has been started and I am tempted to say it is
irreversible,'' said Jacques Delors, the head of the community's
executive body and head of a panel that wrote the report calling for
a single currency and central bank.
   ``I understand that political striptease contains a number of
steps that are not automatically linked to each other,'' added
Delors, predicting further concessions from Mrs. Thatcher.
   He could be wrong.
   Mrs. Thatcher insists a common currency and central bank would
strip the British Parliament of sacrosanct rights to formulate
financial policy, and has suggested that in the end many other
leaders would be equally reluctant to surrender these powers.
   ``It takes away the power of the nation-state and takes away
power which is at the heart of parliamentary democracy, power over
the budget, power over the economy,'' she said in a British
television interview at the end of the conference.
   But officials noted throughout Madrid that she adopted a softer
stance and she repeatedly stressed that Britain is committed to
Europe.
   ``Her tone was substantially changed and in the community the
tone can be as important as the substance,'' said one EEC official,
requesting anonymity. ``Now we all seem to be talking about the same
sort of Europe and providing we agree we're living in the same sort
of Europe, we can find a way to advance.''

   A city councilman held on to his job
Tuesday despite efforts by a smokers rights group to snuff out his
political career for sponsoring a tough anti-smoking ordinance.
   Unofficial results showed City Councilor Richard Chapman winning
all 22 consolidated precincts in his northeast Albuquerque district.
   City Clerk Eleanor Sanchez said 3,669 people voted against the
recall, while 1,359 voted for it.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Chapman, 41. ``In most senses the vote was
much larger than me. It was a vote for strong leadership in
Albuquerque. It was a vote for health promotion.''
   Dorothy Jameson, a pack-a-day smoker who is a member of Smokers
Rights of New Mexico, said she was disappointed but said her group
will continue to fight the ordinance Chapman sponsored, which banned
most indoor smoking in public places as of April 19. It carries a
$100 fine for violators.
   Angered by the ordinance, Smokers Rights got enough petition
signatures within Chapman's district to force the recall election.
   Chapman, a nonsmoker, said the recall election had given him a
chance to begin his re-election campaign a little early.
   ``Recognition was very high,'' said Chapman, who will be up for
re-election in October 1991.

<TEXT>
   Smokers Rights contended the council violated the civil rights of
thousands of smokers by prohibiting smoking in such areas as art
galleries, shopping malls, libraries, theaters, taxis, buses and
public work places.
   Chapman said he sponsored the bill because polls showed most
people in Albuquerque favored smoking restrictions.
   Chapman, who campaigned door-to-door against the recall _ often
in temperatures near 100 degrees _ said he was surprised by the
amount of publicity the recall generated.
   ``I didn't have to introduce myself very much,'' he said.

died Tuesday. She was 97.
   Mrs. Bullitt, heiress to a real-estate fortune, was a leading

after King County.
   Mrs. Bullitt ran the outfit with fierce independence, vowing
never to sell air time to religious organizations. That ban remains
in place at KING Television, which she purchased for $375,000 from a
Merrill Lynch employee who had built Channel 5 himself and put it on
the air on Thanksgiving Day, 1948.
   Mrs. Bullitt retired as company president in 1962 but remained
honorary chairman of the board. She was replaced as president by her
son, Stimson Bullitt, an attorney who was succeeded at the station
by Ancil Payne in 1971.

   Frank Trapani, a longtime jazz trumpeter with
the Dukes of Dixieland, died Monday of a blood clot to the lungs. He
was 52.
   Trapani played with the orchestras of Charlie Barnett, Les Elgard
and Billy May, as well as with artists such as Pearl Bailey, Tony
Bennett, Lou Rawls and Quincy Jones.
   He was lead trumpeter with the Dick Stabile Orchestra in New
Orleans for 12 years until 1974, when he joined the Dukes of
Dixieland. For the past 12 years he was the Dukes' front man, the
musician who introduced each number to the audience.

   Sir Alfred J. Ayer, the British philosopher who
helped popularize the notion that all philosophy can be reduced to
linguistic analysis, died Tuesday after a lenghty respiratory
illness at age 78.
   Ayer's first book, ``Language, Truth and Logic,'' in 1936 was the
first exposition of logical positivism in the English language.
   The movement, which Ayer helped to develop in Britain, expounds
the view that philosophical problems of the past can be reduced to
linguistic analysis, and that any idea that cannot in principle be
verified by sensory observation is nonsensical.
   Ranging widely between the ideas of linguistic philosophers
Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, it accepts that language
must be strictly analyzed and redefined if there is any possibility
of using it as an intelligible means of logical argument.
   The philosophical school of linguistic analysts now dominates
many British and American universities.
   Ayer also wrote ``The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' in
1940 and ``The Problem of Knowledge'' in 1956, as well as volumes of
philosophical essays and histories of modern philosophy in which he
extended the traditions of British empiricism.

   Elizabeth Henry, 86, one of the founders of
the ``Meals on Wheels'' program in this country, died Sunday of
pneumonia.
   In 1958, Ms. Henry and two other members of the Visiting Nurses
Association started the program in Rochester, N.Y., after they had
witnessed its success in England.
   Their first delivery was 14 meals. Today, Meals on Wheels is
active in hundreds of U.S. cities, ensuring that those who can't
provide for themselves have meals delivered five days a week.
   Ms. Henry, a past-president of the National Dietetic Association,
retired from the Visiting Nurses Association as a nutritionist in
1968.

   The state Assembly has passed a bill forcing
purveyors of so-called junk fax to send the unwanted facsimile
transmissions only at night throughout New York.
   The partial ban, a compromise given final legislative approval
Tuesday, limits the transmission of unsolicited fax messages to 9
p.m. to 6 a.m., or during business hours between companies with a
longstanding business relationship. Violators would be subject to
$100 fines.
   The bill now goes to Gov. Mario Cuomo for his signature.
   Two other states have passed some kind of facsimile limitations,
and as least eight other states as well as Congress are looking at
fax caps.

<HEAD>Workers Begin Implementing Experts' Plan to Save Treaty Oak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY FIKAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Someone tied a yellow ribbon around the
centuries-old Treaty Oak, a bright reminder of people's concern as
workers hustled to help the historic tree survive a poisonous attack.
   ``If there's power in prayer, this tree's going to be a real
survivor,'' said Jack Siebenthaler, executive director of the
American Society of Consulting Arborists in Florida.
   A man suspected of poisoning the venerable tree may have done it
as part of an occult ritual, to cast a spell to protect a woman or
because of a rivalry over a woman, the Austin American-Statesman
reported today, citing sources it did not identify.
   Police Sgt. John Jones said investigators are looking for one
person, whom he did not identify. Jones has refused to discuss a
motive for the poisoning.
   Legend has it that Stephen F. Austin, the father of Texas, signed
a treaty with the Indians under the 50-foot tree's branches.
   But even though The Handbook of Texas, a guidebook that includes
state history, says the story has little foundation, visitors on
Tuesday continued to leave get-well messages in front of a roped-off
area that limits access to the tree.
   Siebenthaler was among state and national experts who developed a
plan to help the tree in its struggle against the effects of the
powerful herbicide Velpar, which was deposited in the roots. Police
are investigating but know of no motive.
   The plan to save the tree could be in place by week's end, said
James Houser, head of the experts' task force and chairman of the
Austin Urban Forestry Board.
   A sprinkler system will mist the tree's foliage with water to
control its temperature, thus reducing stress from heat, and an
irrigation system will be set up, Houser said.
   If soil samples taken Tuesday show the herbicide remains in the
ground despite efforts to remove it, an underground drainage system
could be constructed to flush it out.
   ``What we're trying to do is keep the tree functioning as well as
it can,'' said Houser.
   Arthur Costonis, also a consultant with the arborist society, and
Siebenthaler said they are hopeful for the tree's chances.
   It will be 1991 before experts will know if the tree will survive
because of the potential for delayed stress, Siebenthaler said.

   Actor-bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose
wife, Maria Shriver, is expecting a baby at the end of the year,
says he's ready to take on the responsibilities of fatherhood.
   ``We have love for children, and we have a great relationship,''
said Schwarzenegger in an interview with ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' scheduled for broadcast Thursday.
   ``I know it will work out great, and I just can't wait for this
moment. I mean I'm really excited about it _ to see a little
`Schwarzen-Shriver.' ''
   Schwarzenegger, 41, was interviewed in Mexico City where his new
film, ``Total Recall,'' is in production. Ms. Shriver, 33, is an
anchor for NBC's new prime-time news show, ``Yesterday, Today and
Tomorrow,'' which debuts in August.

   Entertainer Bernadette Peters says her
film career has not been harmed by the box office flop of her last
two movies.
   Ms. Peters, appearing in Atlantic City this weekend, made her
film debut in 1973 in ``Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies.'' She
co-starred with comedian Steve Martin in ``The Jerk,'' in 1979 and
won a Golden Globe Award for ``Pennies From Heaven,'' in 1982. The
same year she starred in ``Annie.''
   This year she was featured in the episodic ``Slaves of New
York,'' a satire of that city's downtown art scene. In ``Pink
Cadillac,'' she played a bail-jumping mother of an infant to Clint
Eastwood's bounty hunter.
   ``I don't think `Slaves' was received well because there wasn't a
lot of publicity done for it,'' she said. ``And `Pink Cadillac' is a
fun summer movie but it's just not a blockbuster so it gets lost
with all these big movies.''
   ``I think my screen career is a very young career,'' she said.
``I did some movies long ago. Now I'm paying more attention to it
and I'm more into the business.''
   Ms. Peters, 41, was nominated for a Tony Award for her
co-starring role in the Broadway show, ``Sunday in the Park With
George'' in 1983, and won a Tony for ``Song and Dance'' in 1985.

   Soviet-born concert pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy says
he will perform in Moscow in November, 26 years after saying he
would never go back.
   The pianist told a news conference Tuesday that the ``historic
changes'' in the Soviet Union made him change his mind.
   Glasnost and perestroika had made his homeland a ``normal and
civilized country'' and he considered it his duty to be part of the
new era, he said.
   Ashkenazy is music director of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,
which he will take to Moscow. He said he will conduct two concerts
at the Moscow Conservatoire and perform a Mozart concerto in the
first of them.
   ``The Russian people are freer to speak out and express
themselves ... There's more honesty about their history, which is an
important foundation,'' he said.
   Ashkenazy, who will be 52 on July 6, left the Soviet Union in
1963 with his Icelandic wife, Dodie, saying he was going for good.
In 1983, he said he would only go back if there were ``substantial
changes,'' which he thought would take centuries.

   Domino's Pizza founder Thomas Monaghan says he
puts religion before business because ``that's what I care about
most.''
   In an interview in the July issue of Gentlemen's Quarterly,
Monaghan _ who also owns the Detroit Tigers baseball team and a
leading collection of Frank Lloyd Wright designs _ said that ``the
most flattering thing anybody can say about me is that I'm a good
Catholic.''
   Monaghan said he tries to put his religious principles into
practice in business. ``I do feel some kind of supreme confidence in
doing the right thing, overcoming obstacles,'' he said. ``I feel
that by being fair, it always comes out right. I don't burn bridges.
I try to treat everybody nice. In other words, I try not to let
power corrupt.''
   He also tries to run a lot _ at least six miles a day.
   ``I don't think it's possible for a person who runs regularly to
be a bad person,'' he said.

   Adam West, the Batman of television fame,
says he's been too busy to see the new Batman movie and he's content
to leave the crime fighting to Michael Keaton's new version of the
fictional character.
   ``I guess if anyone should see it, I should,'' he said Tuesday
while in town for a return of his 1966 Batman movie. ``I've been too
busy. But I'm very curious.''
   West, speaking in the same measured tones Batman used while
facing urban menaces, said he would have liked to star in the new
movie.
   ``But I would not have been well casted,'' he said. ``They have a
different vision. People would expect the same thing Batman was
before _ lighthearted.''
   When the TV show first left the air in 1968, West found himself
hopelessly typecast. He was shot out of cannons at circuses, did
avant-garde theater and wrote screenplays. He also did low-budget
films, such as as ``The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood.''
   The turnaround began when the series became a hit in London
during the mid-1980s. Then came the new movie and word that Batman's
creator, Bob Kane, is releasing an autobiography.
   West has a new movie, ``Doing Time on Planet Earth,'' being
released on video and will appear in a London play.
   ``But I'm not going to give up my lifestyle,'' said West, ``I'll
still play Bruce Wayne, millionaire philanthropist.''

   In the midst of summer reruns, the few new
episodes and new series the networks are offering aren't faring
particularly well in the Nielsens.
   NBC did, however, get a top-10 performance last week from the
A.C. Nielsen Co. out of ``The Gifted One,'' a pilot not on the fall
schedule. ``I wouldn't be surprised if it did well enough to be
considered'' as a possible mid-season replacement, said Preston
Beckman, the NBC director of audience research.
   Pete Kowanko starred as a man with mystical powers who is pursued
by a scientist (John Rhys-Davies) seeking to capture him and study
him.
   Of the summer series, CBS' ``Doctor, Doctor'' did the best,
ranking 38th.
   But a new episode of ABC's ``Hooperman'' was 55th. NBC's
``Highway to Heaven'' was 58th, and ABC's ``The Robert Guillaume
Show'' 59th.
   ``Microcops,'' part of CBS' ``Summer Playhouse,'' a series of
pilots that weren't picked up, ranked 69th. And CBS' ``Hard Time on
Planet Earth'' was 63rd.
   NBC won the week ending June 25, its 53rd in a row, with an
average prime-time rating of 12.3 to CBS' 9.3 and ABC's 9.0.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' maintained its place at No. 1. The rest of the
top 10 included ``Cheers'' NBC, ``Dear John'' NBC, which got its
highest ranking to date, ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``Golden Girls''
NBC, ``A Different World'' NBC, ``The Gifted One'' NBC, ``L.A. Law''
NBC, ``Empty Nest'' NBC and ``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS.
   ABC added ``Coach'' to the top 20. It was tied for 17th, thanks
to a summer time slot on Tuesday behind ``Roseanne.''
   The lowest-rated network shows of the week were: ``Hard Time on
Planet Earth,'' ``Mission Impossible,'' ``Mickey's 60th Birthday,''
``Paradise,'' ``Beauty &amp; the Beast,'' ``Incredible Sunday,'' ``Tour
of Duty,'' ``Microcops,'' ``Have Faith'' and ``The Right of the
People.''
   The news race continued to be neck and neck, with the ``CBS
Evening News'' barely winning the week on a 9.2 rating and 20 share.
``ABC World News Tonight'' had a 9.0 and 20 share, and ``NBC Nightly
News'' had an 8.5 and 19.
   The rating is a percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes in
the United States that have televisions. The share is a percentage
of sets in use.

   Environmentalists rejected a deal allowing
timber to flow to Northwest mills while protecting the habitat of
the rare spotted owl, but worked toward a deadline for compromise
with the logging industry.
   Lawmakers hoped to attach a rider to a House spending bill to
establish timber harvest levels for fiscal 1990. The bill is to be
considered Thursday.
   ``I don't think the environmental community really wants to
torpedo this agreement,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., who met with
conservationists Tuesday. ``I think cool heads can come together.''
   A compromise for saving old growth forest while opening some land
to loggers was offered Saturday at the so-called spotted owl summit
of timber industry representatives, environmentalists, the seven
members of Oregon's congressional delegation and Gov. Neil
Goldschmidt.
   The industry currently is blocked from logging many forest tracts
by federal injunctions brought to protect the old growth forests,
the owl's sole habitat.
   ``We are talking about the extinction of a species and shouldn't
act precipitously,'' said Andy Kerr, conservation director for the
Oregon Natural Resources Council.
   ``Conservationists, like misers, may be hell to live with, but we
make great ancestors.''
   Environmentalists said they supported many aspects of the
compromise but had trouble getting information they needed from the
U.S. Forest Service.
   ``Yesterday we got three different answers to how much has been
cut already and how much is available,'' said Larry Tuttle, Oregon
director of The Wilderness Society. ``I think we need that kind of
baseline information before anybody can proceed much further.''
   The timber industry warned that it could drop its initial
approval of the deal if the cut level was reduced. Industry
representatives claim that up to 18,000 jobs could be lost unless
timber tied up in court battles is freed.
   The proposal called for allowing 8 billion board feet of timber
to be harvested from national forests in Oregon and Washington and 1
billion board feet from Bureau of Land Management forests in Oregon
through Sept. 30, 1990. Some of the logged lands would be old growth
forests, but loggers would accept The Wilderness Society guidelines
for protecting large blocs of the forest.

   The golf ball Oliver Anthony put in his
pants pocket turned out to be his best shot of the day when it
snagged a bullet fired by a would-be robber.
   ``The golf ball saved my leg and it might have saved my life,''
said Anthony, 61.
   Police Capt. Joe Holt said the bullet hit the ball dead center
and lodged there, leaving Anthony with a bruised leg.
   The bullet appeared to be from a .32- or .38-caliber weapon, Holt
said Tuesday.
   ``We haven't weighed it because it's still in the golf ball,'' he
said.
   Anthony said he was playing golf on a city course Sunday when a
young man walked up, brandished a pistol and demanded money.
   ``I told him he better put that gun away before I wrapped a club
around his head. Then he started shooting,'' Anthony said.
   Anthony said four or five shots were fired but he did not know he
was hit until he returned to the clubhouse and noticed a hole in a
pants leg.
   ``When I emptied my pocket, there was the golf ball with the
bullet in it,'' he said.
   Holt said the gunman ran away after the shooting and no arrests
were made.

   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is winning
praise on Capitol Hill for opening the traditionally closed doors of
federal nuclear weapons plants to independent safety checks by
outside agencies.
   Watkins was touring an Energy Department waste dump in New Mexico
today and meeting with three governors to discuss a plan to give
states a larger role in decisions about nuclear weapons production
and waste management.
   Watkins on Tuesday also renewed his attack on the department's
past management of the weapons program.
   ``The chickens have finally come home to roost,'' Watkins said,
after ``years of inattention to changing standards and demands
regarding the environment, safety and health.''
   Managers failed to understand that weapons production goals can
be met without sacrificing safety and protection of the environment,
he said.
   Watkins announced a series of steps he said will ``chart a new
course'' for his department in ensuring that the 17 major weapons
plants in 12 states comply with all state and federal environmental
laws.
   The weapons plants have been crippled in recent years by a series
of mechanical failures, safety lapses and delays in repair and
construction plans. The problems have left the United States for the
first time without the ability to make tritium, a radioactive gas
needed to produce thermonuclear weapons.
   Watkins also announced he had abandoned hope of opening a nuclear
waste dump in New Mexico in September. He said the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, near Carlsbad, required more review by experts outside
the department. He said he expected to open the plant next year but
would not set a specific target date.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., praised the decision.
   ``We can only be encouraged by his intentions to make DOE more
credible in its operations _ especially by allowing outside entities
more room to review DOE operations,'' he said.
   Watkins told a news conference at the Energy Department he is
ordering talks with state governments on ways to let them
independently check federal data on environmental issues and defense
waste cleanup schedules for weapons plants within their borders.
   The Energy Department worked out such a deal with Colorado
earlier this month after Gov. Roy Romer threatened to close the
Rocky Flats weapons plant. The FBI raided the plant on June 6 to
search for evidence of illegal waste dumping.
   Watkins called the Colorado accord a ``model for new DOE
cooperation with the states.'' He was meeting today with Romer, New
Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers and Gov. Cecil Andrus of Idaho.
Continued operation of weapons plants in those three states are
linked to the opening of the New Mexico waste dump.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., who has urged Watkins to postpone
opening the waste dump because of doubts about its structural
integrity, said he was encouraged by Watkins' new emphasis on safety
over weapons production.
   ``Admiral Watkins' statement ... is music to my ears,'' Synar
said.
   Environmentalists were less enthusiastic.
   ``We remain very skeptical of Watkins ... because of his seeming
unwillingness to have outside people involved in a meaningful way''
in decisions about the weapons plants, said Frances Close Hart, who
chairs the Energy Research Foundation, an environmental group based
in Columbia, S.C.
   Ms. Hart said Watkins' latest statements appear to indicate a
change in approach but that it is too early to tell whether his
plans will be put into action.
   Watkins said the department brought on much of the environmental
and safety trouble itself by sticking to a tradition of secrecy and
distrust of outside agencies.
   ``The obstacles have been in our own house, not with the
states,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mobutu Visit To Highlight His Role In Angolan Peace Talks</HEAD>

   U.S. officials want to talk with Zaire
President Mobutu Sese Seko about his peacemaking role in Angola but
may downplay his poor human rights record in the first visit by an
African leader during the Bush administration.
   Mobutu was arriving today for three days of talks with the Bush
administration. He had meetings scheduled shortly after his arrival
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney.
   On Thursday, Mobutu is to have two hours of talks with President
Bush, including a working lunch.
   Mobutu's visit reflects the importance he holds for the conduct
of American policy in Africa.
   Briefing reporters about the visit, a senior administration
official said Mobutu's role in organizing last week's peace
conference in Zaire between the Angolan government and the
U.S.-backed UNITA rebels would be high on the agenda. Angola and
UNITA signed a cease-fire that will end a 14-year civil war and lead
to talks on power-sharing.
   The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
American aid for UNITA, much of which has been funneled through
Zaire, will continue until a peace accord is signed.
   The State Department is hoping Mobutu's role in facilitating the
agreement will deflect some of the congressional opposition to
Mobutu over his country's human rights abuses.
   ``We think Zaire's human rights record, while being far from
perfect ... has improved considerably in recent years,'' said the
official. The number of political prisoners has declined, prison
conditions have improved and a human rights ministry has been
established, he said.
   But sentiment in Congress is strongly weighed against Mobutu, and
Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., head of the Black Caucus, has proposed
halting U.S. aid, which is $60 million this year.
   The House has already slashed the administration's request of $9
million for military aid to Zaire next year down to $3 million. The
money is intended for maintenance of U.S.-supplied planes and
equipment, the official said.
   U.S. officials also want to ask Mobutu for his assessment of
recent contacts between the left-leaning government of Mozambique
and the violent RENAMO rebels, he said.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen will travel to
Mozambique's capital of Maputo in July to discuss possible U.S.
involvement in the peacemaking process there, the official said.
   ``I don't think he'll (Mobutu) play a role in Mozambique,'' said
the official. ``He has his hands full with Angola and ... we'd like
him to devote full time to that.''
   Also on the agenda are recent contacts between Zaire and the
apartheid government of South Africa, and the recent agreement Zaire
signed to undertake economic reforms in return for a loan from the
International Monetary Fund.

   The pace of reform in Poland and Hungary is
picking up even as President Bush gets set to visit the two East
European countries _ with assurance to Moscow he will not try to
overhaul their economies or pose a threat to the Soviet Union.
   While Bush on Tuesday was advising Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev not to get ``uptight'' about his trip to Warsaw and
Budapest, U.S. officials said privately the second stage of
elections in Poland and a revamping of the Communist party
leadership in Hungary have improved the trend to democracy.
   There is uncertainty who will eventually become prime minister of
Poland, however, and the reshuffling in Hungary may require a change
in protocol on such delicate issues as who sits next to Bush at
dinner. A four-man ruling body has sharply reduced the power of
General Secretary Karoly Grosz.
   ``He'll still see the same Hungarians, but in what order?'' said
a U.S. official who assessed developments on the condition he would
not be identified. ``We've asked the Hungarians.''
   In both countries Bush will meet with prominent leaders of the
opposition, and he is bound to dwell on his session with Lech
Walesa, the leader of the Polish trade union movement Solidarity.
   Poland has now had two rounds of elections, and Solidarity has
done well. It's won 99 of 100 Senate seats, and the union has won
all of the contested races for the lower house.
   A president is to be chosen by July 18. Bush will be in Warsaw
and Gdansk, the Baltic seaport where Solidarity was launched, July
9-11.
   There may be a caretaker government for a while, and it's not
clear if Wojciech Jaruzelski will wind up wearing the twin hats of
president and Communist party chief.
   ``There is a lot of nervousness among the Poles because nobody
knows how all of this is going to work out,'' said another U.S.
official, who also insisted on anonymity. ``But we know the way the
trend is running, and we welcome the trend.''
   In Hungary, he said, the reshuffling at the top of the party
``doesn't change things much.''
   Democratic change is so far advanced it is conceivable a majority
of the Hungarian parliament will be noncommunist in the next two to
five years, a State Department official told a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee.
   The official, Curtis W. Kamman, deputy assistant secretary for
European affairs, said the administration does not believe House
legislation to give Hungary a five-year exemption from economic and
trade restrictions is needed.
   He explained that Hungary has removed practically all
restrictions on the ability of its citizens to travel abroad or to
emigrate at will, the objective of the restrictions.
   Bush will be in Budapest July 11-13, just before he goes to Paris
for an annual economic summit meeting with the leaders of Britain,
Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Bush said he will not exhort the
Polish and Hungarian people to take actions that might invite
repression.
   ``I want to see a much more open Europe,'' he said. ``And I think
that the importance of the visit is along that line. It's not going
to be that we're going to solve the problem of the Hungarian economy
or the Polish economy.''
   Bush took a relaxed view of U.S.-Soviet competition and
Gorbachev's own travels to the West. For instance, Bush said, it was
``a good thing'' that the Soviet leader went to West Germany earlier
this month.
   ``It's a good thing for him to go to Western Europe, and it's a
good thing for the president of the United States to go to Eastern
Europe,'' he said. ``I want to see us move beyond containment.''
   Bush said he will bring an economic package to Poland, but he
stressed U.S. support for the Polish economy will require further
reforms there.
   In any event, Bush said in regard to both Poland and Hungary that
``being there is the significant thing. It is important that the
United States show its interest in these countries that are
undergoing change. You don't want to over-exhort. You don't want to
over-promise. You don't want to rally people to levels of political
activity that might cause repression.''
   At the same time, Bush said the trip is not designed to send a
signal to Moscow.
   ``I would not expect them to be uptight about it,'' Bush said.
``Mr. Gorbachev goes to Western Europe and is well-received. And I
will go to Eastern Europe and I will be well-received.''

<HEAD>Two Courter Aides Resign Campaign In Midst Of HUD Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. James Courter's top two political
advisers resigned from his gubernatorial campaign over their ties to
the growing scandal of influence peddling within a federal housing
agency.
   Roger Stone and Greg Stevens, two nationally known political
consultants, handed in their resignations Tuesday despite Courter's
repeated denial of links between his campaign and the widening
congressional probe into contracts obtained through the Department
of Housing and Urban Development by prominent Republicans.
   Stone and his firm _ Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly _ are
resigning as Courter's political strategists. Stevens will step down
as Courter's media adviser.
   Stone said he withdrew from the campaign because of ``unwarranted
recent news coverage'' about his firms ties to the HUD scandal.
Stone said the scandal would distract voters from the Courter
campaign's attempts to spotlight his Democratic opponent, Rep. James
Florio, as the political boss of Camden County. ``We are intent on
preventing Jim Florio and the Democrats from using my association
with the campaign as a club against Jim Courter,'' Stevens said.
   Stone, Stevens and the Courter camp have consistently and curtly
rejected any suggestion of ties to improper activities within HUD,
but the controversy has been dogging the campaign.
   Stone's firm received more than $300,000 in fees under a no-bid
contract for a moderate-income housing project in Cumberland County,
in southern New Jersey. Paul Manafort, who handled the project,
described his own involvement as ``influence peddling.''
   Stevens, who is Gov. Thomas H. Kean's former chief of staff, has
said he made a telephone call on Manafort's behalf to link him up
with New Jersey housing officials.
   Stone has handled both of Gov. Thomas H. Kean's campaigns and
both of President Reagan's New Jersey campaigns. He also ran the
unsuccessful U.S. Senate race by Pete Dawkins last year.

   Iceland's women-only party complains
it's being treated like ``little flowers'' with little ideas. But a
rival woman lawmaker says the feminists are not taking politics
seriously and degrading Parliament.
   Two years ago the Women's List, the world's first all-female
party, captured six seats in the 63-member Althing, or parliament,
and for a while it looked like a potential power-broker.
   But today, says Women's List lawmaker Thorhildur Thorleifsdottir,
Iceland's male-dominated society and especially its media have
formed ``a very great coalition to silence us.''
   Male and female opponents say the Women's List won't be taken
seriously unless it plays politics Icelandic-style _ which the
Women's List refuses to do, saying it means surrender to a system
designed and run by men.
   The Kvennalist, Icelandic for Women's List, is radical,
anti-nuclear and opposes Iceland's membership in NATO.
   This puts it outside the centrist political mainstream, as does
its dogged insistence on being non-establishment. It has no
hierarchy or leadership, operates by consensus, rotates members in
and out of parliament and has an eight-year limit on being a
lawmaker.
   The Women's List sees these policies as strengths. Political
rivals and Western diplomats say they are weaknesses.
   ``Hierarchy is very much a male thing. Women try to run their
homes without a hierarchy and we see this country as one large
family,'' said Sigridur Duna Kristmundsdottir, a Kvennalist founder
who served in Parliament for four years.
   ``We are very concerned about not having power accumulate in a
few hands,'' she said.
   Ms. Thorleifsdottir added: ``We made it clear in the election
that when you vote for our list, you vote for ideas, not for people.
But, of course, that goes against all the rules. It's a threat to
the system.''
   Opponents counter that seasoned, recognized leaders are needed if
the Women's List wants to share power in a coalition, the
traditional style of government in this north Atlantic island nation
of 250,000 people.
   Gudrun Helgadottir, the first female president of the Althing,
the world's oldest parliament, said rotating members was absurd.
   ``Parliament is not meant to be some sort of schooling system,''
she complained. ``I think it degrades the parliament.''
   Mrs. Helgadottir, a member of the left-wing People's Alliance
that belongs to the current three-party center-left governing
coalition, said the need for consensus keeps the Women's List out of
government.
   ``Such a movement can never be homogeneous enough to take
political stands,'' she said.
   But Ms. Kristmundsdottir said the Women's List has stayed out of
coalitions because other parties would not meet its minimum demands.
   ``I would be happy if we have 15-16 percent of the vote in the
next election which would give us nine or 10 MPs and make us
seriously consider entering a coalition group,'' she said.
   Iceland gave women the vote before other European countries, and
since 1980 it has had a woman president, Vigdis Finnbogadottir.
   The Women's List was founded in 1981 by a dozen women who saw the
salary gap between men and women widening despite a 1976 equal
rights law.
   It won three Althing seats in the election of 1985, a year in
which Icelandic women celebrated the United Nations Decade of the
Woman with a one-day strike that paralyzed the country.
   It won nearly 11 percent of the vote in the 1987 election,
doubling its seats. A year later it had 28 percent in an opinion
poll.
   That fell to 12 percent in a poll last April, but even opponents
concede that the Women's List is a fascinating phenonemon that has
inspired women elsewhere.
   ``This is not supposed to be an Icelandic phenomenon,'' said Ms.
Kristmundsdottir. ``This is valid for women everywhere else if they
think so themselves.''
   She said Denmark has established a women's party that expects to
run in the next election, and women from Canada, Norway, The
Netherlands, the United States and West Germany have expressed
interest.
   Women's List lawmakers complain that they're viewed as ``little
flowers.'' Ms. Thorleifsdottir, a theater director and mother of
five, said too many powerful men believe the party has ``nice little
ideas'' not worth pursuing.
   ``This ... is a great danger to the world because it shows that
men are not interested in any new ideas,'' she said. ``Obviously, we
are going to have to find some way to break small holes in this
wall.''
   Ms. Thorleifsdottir said women still earn just 53 percent as much
as men, but the party claims credit for getting housework valued as
work experience and maternity leave extended from three to six
months.
   Mrs. Helgadottir says there is another achievement by the Women's
List: ``The other political parties don't dare now bring forward
lists of candidates without women.''

<HEAD>USDA is Bullish on Raising Sheep</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department analyst says the
once-troubled U.S. sheep industry has settled into a profit-making
venture that no longer shows signs of the traumatic declines of
decades past.
   The number of sheep has plummeted from a high of 56 million in
1942 to fewer than 11 million today. But economist Richard Stillman
says that since about 1980, the U.S. inventory ``has exhibited
cyclical fluctuations'' that are typical of most livestock
production.
   ``A shrinking group of people with a taste for lamb largely
caused the decline,'' he said. ``Growth in competing man-made fibers
and shortages of skilled shepherds also contributed.''
   Stillman added: ``Contrary to popular opinion, lamb imports have
not contributed to the decline in domestic production; imports and
production have declined in tandem.''
   The good news is that as a specialized industry, raising sheep
``continues to be profitable,'' he said. ``The downside to a small
industry is that the efficiencies of a larger scale in slaughter and
distribution cannot be fully exploited, and both producers and
consumers bear the brunt of higher processing and distribution
costs.''
   Most sheep production is concentrated in the drier areas of 17
Western states, where raising sheep or cattle is often the only
viable use of the land, Stillman said. Texas, with 18 percent of the
inventory on Jan. 1, is the largest producer. Colorado, however,
turns out the most feedlot sheep and lambs for the slaughter market.
   Writing in the July issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine,
Stillman said the sheep industry has not attracted new producers,
although studies by the department's Economic Research Service show
sheep production has been profitable in twice as many years recently
as cattle.
   Part of that profitability has been due to the federal wool
program, which provides subsidies to producers when wool market
prices are down.
   ``Disease and predator problems translate into a higher death
rate for sheep than for other livestock,'' Stillman said. ``Also,
the shepherd's lonely existence makes it difficult to attract
skilled labor. Moreover, sheep require twice the labor of cattle for
the same enterprise base.''
   In response to some of these problems, producers have increased
the average yield of sheep. Through genetic selection and feedlot
finishing, the dressed weight of lambs was raised to 63 pounds in
1988 from an average of 51 pounds in 1970.
   Thus, Stillman said, producers can reduce the sizes of their
breeding herds and still maintain the same level of production.
   But only a small segment of the population eats lamb or mutton.
Consumption is expected to average about 1.4 pounds per person this
year, compared with beef at about 71 pounds, pork at 63, and
broilers at 65.
   The sheep industry has been trying to attract new customers
through educational campaigns on how to buy and prepare lamb.
   But Stillman said the industry still faces the prospect of
boosting consumption of a relatively expensive red meat at a time
when all red meats are losing market share to poultry.
   Some of the exporting countries are providing innovations,
shipping fresh lamb by air instead of freezing and sending it by
ship to U.S. markets. Australia leads in fresh lamb sales to the
United States, and New Zealand is shipping live lambs to Oregon.
   ``This year, 27,000 landed in May, and another shipment of about
27,000 is to follow,'' Stillman said. ``However, live lamb imports
are still small compared with annual domestic slaughter of about 5.3
million head.''

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat for delivery this year under the
long-term grain agreement between the two countries.
   Agriculture Department officials said Tuesday that the sale, by
unidentified private exporters, was a straight commercial
transaction and did not involve subsidies under the department's
Export Enhancement Program.
   The Soviet Union has bought more than 4.2 millions of tons of
wheat under EEP arrangements for 1988-89 delivery, the most recent
being 96,000 tons announced on June 23.
   Although the Soviets had virtually used up the previous EEP
allocation, a new deal for an additional 1.5 million tons of wheat
was announced May 2. Officials said Moscow still has 814,200 tons
available under the program.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. According to the latest USDA five-day average, the price
of wheat has been $3.85 per bushel, meaning the latest sale of
approximately 14.7 million bushels could have a farm value of around
$56 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The sale announced Tuesday boosted to more than 21.2 million tons
the amount of grain Moscow has bought for delivery in the sixth year
of the agreement, which began last Oct. 1. Of that, corn makes up
nearly 16.2 million tons, and wheat, more than 5 million tons.
   In addition, the Soviets have bought 442,500 tons of soybeans;
1.35 million tons of soybean meal; and more than 1 million tons of
grain sorghum.

   The Associated Press incorrectly attributed a
statement made by Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., in debate on the
savings and loan bailout bill.
   Kerrey had proposed an amendment to strengthen supervision of the
Resolution Trust Corp., which is to handle liquidation of the assets
of insolvent savings and loans.
   Kerrey's comments in support of that position were incorrectly
attributed to Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass. A spokesman for Kerry said
the Massachusetts senator supported Kerrey's position and voted for
the amendment. It was not approved.

   A 3,000-acre wildfire
roared through dense chaparral here Tuesday, threatening buildings
and prompting the evacuation of campgrounds, a prison and a nudist
camp, authorities said.
   No structural damage or injuries were reported from the blaze,
which was reported at around 3:15 p.m. on the border of Orange and
Riverside counties, said Cele Cundari of the U.S. Forest Service.
   Evacuations were called for the Convail Nudist Camp, the Ortega
Campground, Los Pinos Camp correctional facility, and residents of
Morrell Canyon and the small community of El Carriso Village, Ms.
Cundari said.
   Three fingers of flame were heading northeast, threatening about
100 buildings, she said.
   ``It's very steep and rocky, and the winds are very erratic,''
she said. ``They come down the canyons, plus the fire builds its own
winds, and it could change direction.''
   About 200 firefighters were on the scene, with 400 others
scheduled to be called in from around the state, she said.

<HEAD>Legislation Would Make Handgun Makers Liable for Injuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Council on Tuesday
gave preliminary approval to a bill to make handgun manufacturers
and distributors financially liable forinjuries or deaths caused in
shootings.
   The 8-4 vote was on legislation to allow shooting victims and the
families of homicide victims to recover monetary damages from the
manufacturer of a gun used in a shooting, regardless of who was at
fault. If given final approval, it could be the first such law in
the United States.
   Manufacturers around the country generally have not been held
responsible by the courts for gun damage under existing laws. The
new legislation could expose them to hundreds of new lawsuits.
   Council members said they hope the measure will reduce the
availability of firearms in the district, as well as around the
country.
   ``This is not PR,'' said council member William P. Lightfoot,
D-At Large, a proponent of the legislation. ``If you make a
dangerous weapon, we're going to hold you responsible any time it is
used.''
   Richard R. Atkinson Jr., a member of the board of directors of
the National Rifle Association and president of the District of
Columbia Firearms Association, said the council's action could have
a negative impact on home rule by giving its federal opponents
additional ammunition with which to attack the district's local
government.
   ``I think if the city council continues with this kind of
meddling in other states' affairs, it will go down in history as the
city council that lost home rule,'' he said.
   During the council debate over the legislation Tuesday, opponents
of the handgun bill raised similar concerns.
   Council member Betty Ann Kane, who voted against the bill, called
it a ``knee-jerk'' response to the violence on the street. She said
she doesn't understand ``why we are taking away individual
responsibility'' for the commission of shooting crimes.

<HEAD>Congress Seeks to Plug Ethics Law `Loophole'</HEAD>

   Congress is trying to block the route which
former Reagan administration aide Lyn Nofziger used to win a
reversal of his conviction for illegal lobbying.
   Rep. Barney Frank said Tuesday the House Judiciary Committee will
consider amending the Ethics in Government Act to revise provisions
Nofziger used successfully in appealing his 1988 conviction.
   ``We saw it as a potential loophole,'' said Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat.
   In a 2-1 decision Tuesday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
Nofziger's conviction must be set aside because it wasn't based on a
finding that he had knowledge of each element of the offense.
   He was convicted Feb. 11, 1988, of three counts of illegally
lobbying top presidential aides on behalf of private clients after
he left the White House one year into the Reagan administration. The
clients were scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a maritime engineers
union and the manufacturer of the Air Force's A-10 anti-tank plane.
   The appeals court said Tuesday that in order for a conviction to
be valid, the prosecution must demonstrate that Nofziger knew the
matters on which he lobbied were already of ``direct and substantial
interest'' to the White House.
   The proposed amendment would eliminate the provision requiring
knowledge of each element of the offense, said Frank, chairman of
the House subcommittee on administrative law. Congress passed a
similar measure last year but it was vetoed by President Reagan.
   Independent counsel James McKay, who prosecuted Nofziger, said he
will consider appealing. He could seek a review by the federal
appeals court in Washington or by the Supreme Court.
   A five-year statute of limitations could make it impossible to
bring revised criminal charges.
   His conviction was reversed in a decision written by U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals Judge James Buckley, joined by Judge Stephen
Williams, both Reagan appointees. The third member of the panel and
lone dissenter was Judge Harry Edwards, a Carter administration
appointee.
   Nofziger, the White House political director in 1981, began
lobbying his former colleagues within months of leaving the
government. He said he was trying to stimulate their interest in
various matters, which would not be a violation of the one-year ban
on lobbying an ex-employee's former government agency.
   The case against Nofziger was the first major test of the
revolving-door provisions of the Ethics in Government Act.
   ``I don't think I am part of any revolving-door syndrome,'' said
Nofziger. ``People lobby in this town; the main industry in this
town besides government is lobbying.''
   Asked whether he thought he got off on a legal technicality,
Nofziger said, ``Absolutely no ... I think they came after me on a
technicality.''
   Nofziger said he was pleased by the decision. ``I think I was
innocent from the beginning; I still think I am innocent,'' he said.
   The court ruling won praise from President Bush and other
high-level administration officials.
   Bush, asked about the ruling at a state dinner Tuesday night
honoring Australian Prime Minister Robert Hawke, smiled broadly and
said only, ``I'm always glad when somebody is found not guilty of
something.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III called the decision
``terrific,'' adding, ``There's no doubt in my mind and never has
been that he did not intend to break the law.''
   Bush said he had not spoken with Nofziger since the decision, but
Chief of Staff John Sununu said he called Nofziger to congratulate
him.
   ``I kind of felt that it was important that he know that at least
some of his old friends hadn't forgotten him,'' Sununu added.
   Nofziger had been sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined
$30,000. He said that defending himself cost over $1.5 million in
legal fees and possibly more than that in lost income.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Flag Issue Sends Bush Back on Campaign Trail</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Supreme Court upheld flag burning as a
protected form of free speech, George Bush heard fire bells and was
back on the campaign trail once more.
   As Bush has been fond of saying (quoting baseball philosopher
Yogi Berra), it seemed like ``deja vu all over again.''
   Bush used the flag _ in particular, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis' veto of a state pledge-of-allegiance bill _ to great
political effect in 1988.
   Now, he's mounting yet another campaign in defense of the flag _
one to amend the Constitution to set aside last week's 5-4 Supreme
Court decision and forbid flag-desecration at the federal level.
   Amending the Constitution is extremely difficult. In the 200-year
history of the document, thousands of amendments have been advanced
but only 26 ratified.
   However difficult the process, the call for a pro-flag amendment
was politically an easy one. It doesn't increase the federal
deficit, doesn't affect federal services, doesn't cost the president
political support, doesn't alienate most special interests. And it
once again puts Democrats on the defensive.
   It was a safe campaign tactic for Bush a year ago, and a safe
presidential pronouncement for him now.
   Many Democrats, still smarting from Bush's 1988 attack on Dukakis
on the flag issue and their own failure to respond quickly enough,
joined congressional Republicans in denouncing the court's decision
last week. But they were treading with extreme wariness on Bush's
proposal.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., balked when reporters
suggested that Democratic failure to endorse Bush's call for a
constitutional amendment could give Republicans a partisan issue.
   ``I'm sure people will play politics with any emotional issue ...
playing the most cynical politics ... for the most base and crass
political purposes,'' Foley said.
   Such partisanship would be ``reprehensible and disgusting,''
Foley continued, as if he hadn't gotten the point across. ``I'm
condemning those who are doing it.''
   Just who might that be? Foley didn't say.
   Bush was asked about his own partisan use of the flag issue at a
hastily called news conference on Tuesday, held a day after he told
the New York Times in an interview he was undecided on how best to
respond to last week's court order and had asked aides to study the
issue for him.
   Given his ``renewed concern'' about proper reverence for the
flag, Bush was asked, did he think it helped the situation for him,
or any other politician, to make the flag ``an instrument of
partisan politics as it was in your campaign?''
   ``I don't view that as partisanship,'' Bush responded. ``I think
respect for the flag transcends political party and I think what
I've said here is American, it isn't Republican or Democrat, it
isn't liberal or conservative.''
   Asked whether he disputed that he used the flag for the purpose
of advancing his political campaign last year, Bush replied
candidly: ``Everything I did last year was for the purpose of _
everything I did politically _ advancing my election ...''
   ``But I didn't put it on the basis that Republicans are for the
flag and Democrats are not.''
   Bush's comments sounded similar to his response during the
campaign when asked whether he was challenging Dukakis' patriotism.
No, not his patriotism, Bush insisted, he was only questioning the
Democrats' judgment.
   At issue was a state law requiring Massachusetts public school
teachers to lead their classes in the pledge of allegiance. Dukakis
vetoed it, claiming that his legal advisers had said the measure was
unconstitutional.
   Had he been governor of Massachusetts, Bush said during the
campaign, he would have figured out a way to make the law stick.
   He paid a well-publicized visit to a flag factory in New Jersey
to drive home his message, and throughout the campaign surrounded
himself with rows upon rows of waving flags.
   Last Wednesday's Supreme Court decision _ in which two
conservative members of the court joined the majority _ gave Bush an
easy chance to do just what he condemned Dukakis for failing to do:
find a way to make a flag law stick.
   Civil liberties groups blasted the move. ``It should come as no
surprise that the president who made the pledge of allegiance the
centerpiece of his campaign is now willing to make flag-burning his
chief domestic initiative. It is triumph of politics over policy,''
said Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way.
   But Bush's stand was warmly received by Republicans and
conservative Democrats in Congress.
   And the president himself had no difficulty defending his
outspokenness on the flag issue while remaining silent on other
recent constitutional issues, including court decisions making it
harder for minorities to bring discrimination suits against
employers.
   ``I've got to confess, I do feel viscerally about burning the
American flag,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fed, Congress Add Pressure Banks to Join Debt Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators and members of Congress are
threatening to trim the profits of the nation's biggest banks if
they continue resisting ``voluntary'' reductions in debt owed them
by Third World countries.
   The Federal Reserve is the latest to put the pressure on, telling
a House subcommittee it will order the banks to set aside more
reserves to cover possible losses from the loans unless there is
progress soon on Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's debt reduction
plan.
   ``Without further cooperation between borrowers and lenders,
credit quality will continue to deteriorate as more countries become
unable or unwilling to service their bank debts,'' William Taylor,
the Fed's director of banking supervision and regulation, said
Tuesday.
   ``In such an event, further significant increases in reserves
will clearly be required,'' Taylor told the House Banking
subcommittee on international development, finance, trade and
monetary policy.
   The panel's chairman, Del. Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., and Rep. John
LaFalce, D-N.Y., have introduced separate bills that would require
banks to double their reserves for Third World loan losses. Such a
move could cut the earnings of those banks by $20 billion.
   ``If there is one lesson we have learned from the savings and
loan crisis, it's that we must require adequate reserves on
high-risk loans,'' said LaFalce.
   In addition, Fauntroy would prohibit banks that do not
participate in the Brady plan from taking any tax losses on the
loans if and when they are declared in default.
   U.S. commercial banks now hold $70.7 billion of some $340 billion
in troubled Third World loans but have set aside reserves of only
$23 billion to cover them, most of it in the past two years.
   The General Accounting Office said Tuesday that based on the
discounted value of the loans, regulators should be requiring
reserves of nearly $50 billion instead of the $4.9 billion now
mandated.
   Allan Mendelowitz, director of trade and finance issues for the
GAO, said the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency
now require reserves on only about 16 percent of the loans owed by
countries with problems servicing their debt.
   And no reserves are required for covering possible losses on a
total of $59.5 billion of the debt carrying a high level of risk or
in arrears, he said. The GAO estimated the value of those loans if
sold on the secondary market at only $23.6 billion.
   Brady's plan calls for reducing Third World debt by 20 percent.
It asks private banks to effectively forgive a portion of the loans
in exchange for promises that government-backed international
lending agencies such as the World Bank will guarantee interest
payments on the remaining balances.
   But in its first major test with Mexico, the plan has run into
stiff resistance among commercial banks.
   After adopting wide-scale austerity programs in the wake of
falling oil prices demanded by lenders, Mexico is now seeking a 55
percent reduction in the nearly $70 billion it owes private
creditors.
   The commercial banks countered that plea with an offer of a 15
percent reduction. Talks between the two parties are continuing.
   But without a general agreement by July 14, when the Paris
economic summit of major industrialized nations opens,
administration officials fear Brady's debt reduction plan _ like
that of his predecessor, James A. Baker III _ may come unraveled.
   Debt-ridden poor countries claim a 20 percent reduction is not
enough to allow them to lift up their economies.
   And other lender nations are skeptical at the plan's ultimate
reliance upon taxpayer assistance through the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund to guarantee private banks against
further losses.
   ``Time is running short and uncertainties appear to be
increasing,'' said Taylor.

   The State Department has done too little to
recruit and promote minorities, and white women are still finding
the road to advancement is steep, a congressional report says.
   A General Accounting Office study of the department's Foreign
Service found that despite advances for minorities and white women,
the numbers are low when compared to the civilian labor force.
   ``The State Department increased minority representation in the
Foreign Service from 7 percent in 1981 to 11 percent in 1987,'' said
the study, required by the Foreign Service Authorization Act. ``The
percentage of white women has remained essentially unchanged at
about 24 percent.''
   ``Minorities and women are still significantly under represented
at senior levels of the Foreign Service,'' said the report, released
Tuesday.
   The report produced no immediate comment from the State
Department, which is already under orders from a federal court in
Washington to offer new positions to 600 women and to revamp its
entrance examination.
   Although it doesn't mention the lawsuit, the report echoes its
complaints.
   As of September 1987, 6,166 of the State Department's 9,439
Foreign Service employees were white men, the study said. White
women accounted for 2,232 of the employees. There were also 508
black men and women, 324 Hispanics, 42 American Indians or Alaskan
natives, and 159 Asian-Americans or Pacific islanders, the study
said.
   The study noted that white males dominated the political and
economic jobs, both considered more prestigious. Women of all
backgrounds tended to work as consular officers _ people who work on
visas, help Americans overseas, and issue passports. Most minority
males become administrative officers _ the people in charge of
budgets, maintenance and supplies, the study said.
   The study found a particular problem at the mid-level Foreign
Service for white women, saying there should be 771 women in those
positions while in fact there are 311.
   ``If the promotion rates of white women continue at the current
levels ... it could be several years before the State Department
achieves full representation at these levels,'' the study said.
   The State Department stopped hiring white women from outside into
the mid-level positions in 1987.
   The study noted that State's recruiting efforts have not
increased the number of minorities taking the Foreign Service
examination for officer positions, and it said minority men and
women pass the examination at one-fourth the rate of white men.
   It suggested more innovative approaches, including a more active
presence on college campuses.
   The State Department, in a letter that was part of the GAO
report, said it would alter its five-year affirmative action plan to
come up with specific goals and timetables for the hiring and
advancement of minorities.
   It said its revamping of the examination would ensure that there
is no bias against women or minorities.
   Charles Schmitz, vice president of the 20,000-member American
Foreign Service Association, said the problem will be to come up
with a test that doesn't discriminate _ or show ``cultural bias'' _
but assures that the people who represent the United States have ``a
shared body of knowledge.''

<HEAD>House Drought Relief Bill For Farmers Faces White House Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is threatening to veto
and key senators are promising to slash an ambitious drought relief
package approved by the House that would send more than $900 million
to farmers facing crop losses from severe weather.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter warned he would recommend a
veto of the House plan unless the Senate alters the measure, which
he says is too expensive and covers too many crops.
   The House passed the legislation by voice vote Tuesday, hoping to
speed assistance to winter wheat farmers in Great Plains states
where dry weather is expected to sharply reduce this summer's
harvests and to also bring relief to farmers of other crops.
   Supporters estimate the price tag will be about $975 million and
that the money could be covered by expected savings in federal
commodity subsidies, which should be lower because market prices for
drought-shriveled wheat harvests are expected to rise.
   Yeutter estimated the House bill could cost up to $1.5 billion.
He said the administration would support drought assistance limited
to winter wheat.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he would work
for a tighter plan, calling the House bill a ``lavish multi-crop,
multi-peril, multi-bucks bailout for over 600 crops.''
   Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate Agriculture
Committee, which is schedule to take up drought relief on July 19,
have said they favor targeting payments to winter wheat growers.
   The drought bill introduced in the Senate would limit relief to
this year's crops planted in 1988 _ primarily winter wheat. The
House would set up assistance for crops planted this year, although
damage to those harvests is not yet known.
   Yeutter said ``an all-inclusive disaster relief program ... very
well might not be necessary'' for spring-planted crops because their
prospects have been improved by recent rains.
   The House legislation is also not restricted to drought problems,
and would make farmers eligible for aid if they have losses this
year for hundreds of other crops because of severe weather.
   ``No crop is covered unless it suffered a natural disaster. If
there is no disaster there is no coverage at all,'' said Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of a House Agriculture subcommittee on
wheat, sybeans and feed grains. ``So for all of those farmers who
are suffering an extraordinary loss let us do the same thing we did
last year. Let us show compassion. Let us show mercy for those
people.''
   Portions of the Great Plains and western Corn Belt have not
recovered from the drought of 1988, despite recent rains in some
areas. Lingering dry conditions early this year particularly hurt
producers in winter wheat-growing states, which range from
Washington to Ohio and Texas to Montana.
   Nationwide, the winter wheat crop is projected to be the smallest
since 1978. In Kansas, traditionally the nation's leading wheat
producer, forecasters say this year's harvest will be more than a
third smaller than last year.
   Key provisions of the House relief package would:
   _Make farmers eligible for assistance if they suffer losses of
more than 35 percent from a weather-related disaster.
   _Cap benefits at $100,000 for each producer, and prohibit
payments to those with $2 million or more in gross farm revenues.
   _Establish a new $75 million grant program for water assistance
to rural communities in drought areas. Money to pay for the program
would have to be provided in separate legislation.

   Jackie Sexton had to look no farther than
her father's stomach for inspiration in a contest for practical
inventions.
   The 11-year-old East Greenwich resident won a regional prize for
her design of an expandable dress shirt for ``pudgy pops.''
   When the contest sponsored by the non-profit Invent America was
announced in her sixth-grade class, she immediately thought of a
complaint by her father, Richard, that his dress shirts show too
much stomach when he sat down.
   ``My father complained for years about his shirt,'' she said.
   Jackie split the side seams of one of her father's shirts and
sewed in spandex. The shirt was a success the first time he sat down.
   Her invention, ``Pudgy Pop, the Expandable Dress Shirt for Men,''
won the Rhode Island and regional competitions. The young inventor
won a trip to Washington for herself and her family and a $500
savings bond, as well as a $750 grant for her teacher and a $1,250
grant for her school.

   April Abbott started a dating service that caters
to intellectuals about three years ago, and she said she's had
plenty of successful matches.
   She's also had plenty of eggheads.
   Ms. Abbott has about 450 clients, and she said 75 percent have
master's degrees or doctorates. Some are superpicky, she said,
approaching romance as if it could be measured and ordered from a
catalogue.
   One man showed Ms. Abbott a chart he had drawn up to find his
dream woman: If the woman was 5 feet tall, she had to be under 100
pounds; if she was 5-1, then she had to be under 104 pounds, and so
on.
   A few academicians have used scientific arguments, hoping to
spark chemistry that wasn't there, she said. One man who was over 55
years old took his blood pressure in front of a young woman to prove
that he wouldn't die of a heart attack during moments of passion.
   And then there's the woman who married the third man she met
through the service, but still wasn't satisified.
   The woman demanded that she be set up with three other men to
``get her money's worth.'' Instead, Ms. Abbott refunded half of her
$125 fee.

   Politicians often seek a captive
audience, and Gov. Ned McWherter has found one: around town in
restrooms, where his face smiles from a radio station's advertising
posters.
   The advertisement shows the governor wearing a cap bearing the
name of Bubba Skynyrd, a ``redneck'' character who is the alter ego
of disc jockey Carl P. Mayfield on WKDF-FM's morning rock 'n' roll
radio show. McWherter's right hand is raised.
   ``Haaay Dudes! I took the oath ... to listen mornings,'' the ad
says.
   Nashville's Graffiti Indoor Advertising placed the ads last month
in about 36 Nashville locations, mostly in restaurant bathrooms,
said account executive Lars Frederiksen.
   ``I was at a press conference, one of Carl P.'s boys passed me a
cap and I put it on and posed, and that's how I got involved,''
McWherter told WKRN-TV before leaving for Europe this week to
recruit industry.
   McWherter spokesman Ken Renner said the governor generally
prefers not to have his office or likeness used for advertising.
   ``There's not much we can do about it,'' Renner said.

<HEAD>Mammographies and Breast Exams Recommended for Women Over 40</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Routine use of mammography and breast
examinations can reduce deaths from breast cancer in women over age
40, a coalition of medical and research groups says.
   The groups _ including the American Cancer Society, the American
Medical Association and the National Cancer Institute _ on Tuesday
issued recommendations for screening women with no signs or symptoms
of breast cancer:
   _Beginning at age 40, annual clinical breast exams and mammograms
every one or two years;
   _Age 50 and older, breast exams and mammograms every year.
   Breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in U.S. women and
second only to lung cancer in cancer deaths among women. About
142,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with the disease and some
43,000 will die from it this year.
   ``We would like to recommend (these guidelines) to all women and
all doctors in the country as a way of decreasing this great
mortality rate from breast cancer in the United States,'' said
Charles R. Smart, chief of the early detection branch at the
National Cancer Institute.
   The major groups in the coalition had already recommended this
mammography schedule, but some of the other groups had called for
regular mammograms beginning as late as age 50.
   The American Cancer Society and the AMA said they will continue
to recommend that women between 35 and 40 have a baseline mammogram
for doctors to use as a comparison during later regular screening.
   The groups said they agreed on the recommendations to end
confusion caused by differing guidelines, which they said has
resulted in only about a quarter of physicians routinely
recommending mammograms.
   They cited mounting evidence that early detection of breast
cancer prolongs survival and said mammography has improved greatly
as a diagnostic tool since the 1960s.
   About half of all breast cancers currently are found in the early
stages of the disease, but that could increase to 70 to 75 percent
if the recommendations are followed by all women, Smart said.
   The guidelines do not address self-examination, but the groups
said this remains an important tool in the detection of breast
cancer. They noted, however, that cancer detected in this way often
has grown beyond the early stage.
   Endorsing the guidelines were the American Cancer Society, the
American Medical Association, the National Cancer Institute, the
National Medical Association, the American Academy of Family
Physicians, the American Association of Women Radiologists, the
American College of Radiology, the American Society for Therapeutic
Radiology and Oncology, the American Osteopathic College of
Radiology, the American Society of Internal Medicine and the College
of American Pathologists.

   So-called hate crimes involving the race,
religion, ethnic group or sexual preference of victims would come in
for a yearly inventory under a measure approved by the House and
headed for the Senate.
   ``It creates an inventory to quantify the amount of criminal
bigotry in this country,'' Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said Tuesday
as the House approved the measure 368-47.
   The bill would have the Justice Department count the crimes of
homicide, assault, robbery, burglary, theft, arson, vandalism,
trespassing, threats and others the department deems appropriate if
they have an element of bigotry against the victims.
   The House has approved similar bills three times before but the
Senate has not followed suit. Hate-crime legislation cleared the
Senate Judiciary Committee on March 9, however, and supporters are
hoping for a floor vote.
   Annual nationwide crime statistics already are published by the
FBI, but the data is not broken down to reflect crimes involving
bigotry.
   Supporters of the bill say it could help combat a growing wave of
hate crimes across the nation. ``This legislation is an opportunity
to begin the counterattack against crimes based on hate,'' said Rep.
Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.
   ``The more we know about crimes of hate the more chance we have
of preventing them,'' said Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, D-Conn.
   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., said 1,281 anti-Semitic acts were
reported by the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith in 1988.
He said the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force reported 7,008 acts
of anti-homosexual violence in 1987. ``There is also evidence of
growing (Ku Klux) Klan, neo-Nazi, skinhead and other hate-group
activity,'' Green said.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that gathering such
data could cost from $1 million to $10 million a year, depending on
the methods used.
   Supporters said the measure was important for its symbolism as
well as for the actual collection of data.
   ``Congress should send a clear signal to all people that crimes
based on race, religion or sexuality will not be tolerated,'' said
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.

<HEAD>Amid Closings Controversy, Szoka Marks First Year as Cardinal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARGARET MELLOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even a Roman Catholic cardinal has those moments
when he'd trade the management of a 1.5-million-member archdiocese
for the tranquility of ministering to a small congregation.
   But Cardinal Edmund Casimir Szoka, who has waded into several
church disputes since becoming head of the Detroit Archdiocese in
1981, banishes such thoughts quickly.
   ``I am where I am,'' he said.
   Szoka became a priest 35 years ago and started in a small parish,
but began climbing the church hierarchy quickly.
   This month marks the first anniversary of his installation as a
cardinal by Pope John Paul II. It was a year that placed him
squarely at odds with some Detroit Catholics for ordering the
closure or consolidation of 30 inner-city churches.
   Some of those parishes were to go to court today, seeking an
injunction to halt the closings.
   The brouhaha over church closings wasn't Szoka's first challenge.
   Early in his tenure in Detroit, where he was named archbishop in
1981, Szoka set out to make the annulment process in Michigan more
efficient. He increased staff and introduced computers, shortening
the waiting period for an annulment from six years to about nine
months.
   He faced another challenge in his first year when a Roman
Catholic nun, Sister Mary Agnes Mansour, took over as head of the
state Department of Social Services. At the time, the agency
administered abortions for the poor. Szoka wanted her to resign or
publicly oppose abortion. She quit.
   Sitting in his modestly decorated downtown office, Szoka quietly
justified his decisions and church doctrine.
   He expressed dismay over accounts that money alone forced the
church closings. Money was a factor, Szoka said, but more important
was the dwindling number of parishioners and the inadequate supply
of priests.
   ``It's not enough just to maintain a church building and slowly
watch it die as the people die,'' he said.
   He admires the opponents of the closings as deeply dedicated to
parish and faith, but sees his task as providing for the whole
church.
   ``It's always the problem of trying to find the balance of what
is for the common good and what is for special interests.''
   ``I can't work miracles,'' he said. The church-closing dispute
``has made me accept more clearly that all I can do is the best I
can. Accepting that brings a great deal of peace, a great deal of
comfort and tranquility to my life.''
   Szoka was born Sept. 14, 1927, in Grand Rapids to Casimir Szoka,
a Polish immigrant, and Mary Wolgat Szoka. His parents divorced
early in his childhood and he was raised in nearby Muskegon.
   In the eighth grade, he visited St. Joseph's seminary in Grand
Rapids, expecting to find young men locked in unending study and
prayer.
   ``They were normal boys just like us,'' he said. ``I came home
that night, and I remember saying I was going to go to the seminary,
and that never changed.''
   William Kienzle, a seminary classmate and now a mystery writer in
Detroit, said Szoka lived in the library, though Szoka insists he
played handball, baseball and track.
   Even in seminary, it was clear Szoka would be more than a
``simple parish priest,'' classmate Bill Zuidema recalled.
   Out of the seminary, Szoka was appointed associate pastor of St.
Francis Parish in the tiny Upper Peninsula town of Manistique. He
was secretary to the bishop in Marquette and later chancellor there
and in 1971 started a parish in Gaylord.
   After becoming Detroit archbishop, he started an annual
multimillion-dollar fund-raising drive, Catholic Services Appeal.
   Szoka has undergone angioplasty for a narrowed artery, and he
conceded that the duties of running a large, diverse diocese are
taxing.
   Occasionally, he wishes for quieter days.
   ``But only for a moment,'' he said. ``... I have never refused an
assignment, because I still am of the conviction that if an
assignment comes from your superiors in the church, it's coming from
God.''

<HEAD>Eastern Pilots Union Seeks Federal Mediation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Line Pilots Association wants the
federal government to intervene in contract talks with Eastern
Airlines, a request likely to further complicate the strikebound
carrier's plans to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings.
   Meanwhile, separate court-ordered talks, which union officials
say have brought no progress, were continuing for a third day today.
Also today, ALPA leaders from nine other airlines were meeting in
Washington to discuss ways to support the Eastern strikers.
   The pilots' union Tuesday asked the National Mediation Board to
referee its dispute with Eastern, accusing the airline of refusing
to schedule further negotiations as required by the federal Railway
Labor Act.
   ``Despite our repeated efforts, all of the major issues are still
unresolved,'' ALPA President Henry A. Duffy said in a letter
requesting the appointment of a mediator.
   But Eastern said it has balked at further negotiations under the
labor law because the other talks have been ordered by a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court judge who is overseeing Eastern's affairs while it
is under Chapter 11 protection from creditors.
   ``We don't know what they are trying to accomplish with the
mediation,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said. ``We believe that
the bankruptcy court and the examiner are better able to handle
bankruptcy-related labor agreements.''
   Granting of requests for mediation is routine, and in this case
could trigger an unprecedented situation _ mediation of a dispute
involving a bankrupt airline already being struck by another one of
its unions.
   Federal mediation also could result in a direct strike by ALPA
pilots, most of whom have honored Machinists union pickets at
Eastern and are considered legal sympathy strikers in the nearly
four-month-old Machinists strike.
   Nearly 300 pilots have crossed Machinists picket lines, but ALPA
officials contend most of them would refuse to work if their union
struck Eastern. However, Eastern predicts most of the pilots will
continue to work if a pilot strike materializes.
   Airline disputes are regulated by the Railway Labor Act, which
gives the mediation board broad power to try to resolve contract
disputes. Unions cannot strike airlines or railways unless released
from mediation, a situation which occurred prior to the Machinists
strike.
   Eastern last week sought bankruptcy court permission to cancel
its contract with the pilots and impose changes in wages and work
rules it said it needs to reorganize as a smaller carrier.
   But parties involved in federal mediation are prohibited from
altering terms of their contracts.
   Mediation Board spokesman David Bushnell said he did not know
what impact federal mediation would have on Eastern's attempt in
bankruptcy court to abrogate the pilots' contract.
   Matell said Eastern officials believe the bankruptcy court
proceedings would supersede the authority of the Mediation Board.
Cole said ALPA attorneys are reviewing the issue.
   If a mediator declared an impasse, a 30-day cooling off period
would begin, and after that the union would be free to strike and
the airline would be free to change provisions of existing contracts.

<HEAD>Legislation Would Make Handgun Makers Liable for Injuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Handgun manufacturers and distributors would be
financially liable for injuries or deaths caused in shootings, under
a measure awaiting final action by the District of Columbia Council.
   On an 8 to 4 vote Tuesday, the council voted to allow shooting
victims and the families of homicide victims to recover monetary
damages from the manufacturer of a gun used in a shooting,
regardless of who was at fault.
   If given final approval, the measure would be the first such law
in the United States.
   Council members said they hope the measure will reduce the
availability of firearms in the district, as well as around the
country.
   ``This is not P.R.,'' said William P. Lightfoot, an at-large
council member who backs the legislation. ``If you make a dangerous
weapon, we're going to hold you responsible any time it is used.''
   Richard R. Atkinson Jr., a member of the board of directors of
the National Rifle Association and president of the District of
Columbia Firearms Association, warned the council that its action
could harm home rule for the district. Such a law could give federal
opponents new ammunition to attack the district's local government,
he said.
   ``I think if the city council continues with this kind of
meddling in other states' affairs, it will go down in history as the
city council that lost home rule,'' Atkinson said.
   Council member Betty Ann Kane, who voted against the bill, called
it a ``knee-jerk'' response to street violence. She said she does
not understand ``why we are taking away individual responsibility''
for gun-related crimes.

<HEAD>Georgia Case Included in Allegations of HUD Scandals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two brothers are being sued for $7.5 million by
HUD for allegedly failing to turn over $1.6 million from
agency-acquired single-family homes to the government.
   The lawsuit alleges that David and Robert Martin of Atlanta,
escrow agents for the sales, failed to turn over the money between
October 1984 and May 1987.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said an audit leading to the lawsuit
was begun in May 1987 and revealed that government losses reached
$2.5 million.
   Barr and Raymond Buday Jr., the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development's regional counsel, said the investigation
revealed that false documents were filed to mask the non-payment.
   The Martins' lawyers contend the money was paid but cannot be
traced in Washington because of sloppy government bookkeeping.
   The Martins are not charged with a crime.
   ``The nature of the case lent itself to a civil suit,'' Barr said
Tuesday.
   He said there are related criminal investigations pending, but
declined to say if they involved the Martins.
   The homes in question were repossessed by HUD after owners
defaulted on Federal Housing Administration loans.
   There are several investigations into missing funds including
major ones in Indianapolis, Denver, Philadelphia and the Washington,
D.C., area. Investigators say the cases appear unrelated.
   Critics contend the problems stem from incompetence and
influence-peddling at high levels of HUD during the Reagan
administration.

<HEAD>House Committee Endorses Child-Care Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats concur with a Senate-passed
plan to authorize $1.75 billion for child-care programs next year
but are considering a different approach to spending the money.
   The first part of the House plan won approval Tuesday in the
Education and Labor Committee, passing on a 23-11 vote after
Democrats defeated dozens of Republican attempts to significantly
change the measure.
   In addition to its differences with the Senate spending plan, the
House package also lacks the tax-credit provisions adopted by the
Senate last week. The final House measure will likely have a
tax-relief package, too, but chamber rules require it to originate
in the Ways and Means Committee.
   That panel is expected to act on child care next month. The House
leadership then plans to bring the direct spending and tax credits
up for floor debate together. Aides said that might not occur until
late August or September.
   Among the amendments that passed the labor committee was one
trimming the fiscal 1990 spending authorization from $2.5 billion to
$1.75 billion, matching the Senate level. The panel, again following
the Senate's lead, also deleted proposed federal child care
standards from the measure in favor of leaving regulation to the
states.
   At the White House, President Bush reiterated his support for a
child-care measure dependent almost exclusively on tax credits and
said his position has not changed on the Senate measure, which the
administration last week labeled a ``candidate for a veto.'' Bush,
however, left the door open for compromise.
   ``I would like to see what comes down here before I make further
statements about what action I will take or won't take,'' he said,
speaking several hours before the House committee acted.
   Tuesday's committee's action indicated that significant
differences are likely to exist between the Senate bill and the
final House measure.
   The plan endorsed Tuesday would divide the federal spending into
four areas, with 25 percent going to increase funding for Head Start
programs, 25 percent for child-care programs before and after school
in public schools, 35 percent for programs providing services to
children less than 3 years old and the remaining 15 percent for
state programs designed to increase the availability, affordabilty
and quality of child care.
   Working families whose incomes are at or below the poverty line
would be eligible for the programs, with some services also
available on a sliding fee scale for families with annual incomes
within 150 percent of the poverty level.
   The committee's plan would also spend $25 million to create a
fund to give businesses $1 in federal grant money for each $3 spent
on eligible child-care services.
   By contrast, the Senate package calls for 70 percent of the
spending to go directly to low-income parents to help them pay for
child care, including the use of vouchers or other certificates
created by state governments. Twenty-two percent of the money in the
Senate plan would be for loans, grants and training programs
designed to expand child-care opportunity and quality, with the
remaining 8 percent used for state administrative costs.

   The Economic Policy Council is trying to

   The curbs expire Sept. 30 and President Bush is expected to issue
a decision that tries to mollify both sides.
   In 1984, the Reagan administration negotiated five-year,
product-by-product ``voluntary restraint agreements'' with 29
nations, including Japan, South Korea, Brazil and the European
Community, to limit the flow of steel into the United States.
   Three days before last November's election, Bush pledged to renew
the restraints in some form.
   Opponents of the curbs are led by a coalition of U.S.
manufacturers concerned about high steel prices. Supporters say the
restrictions help U.S. industry.

   Operating the controversial Shoreham nuclear
power plant on Long Island would be cheaper that shutting it down,
contrary to an analysis by state regulators, according to a Senate
staff study.
   The analysis was released Tuesday as the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board decided it was
acceptable to use pole-mounted sirens on trucks to notify nearby
residents of an emergency at the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power
plant, the other completed but not operating reactor in the
Northeast.
   The state of Massachusetts and its towns in the evacuation zones
have refused to cooperate in emergency planning, and Massachusetts
Deputy Attorney General Stephen Jonas said the state would appeal
the decision.
   The Senate report, prepared for the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee, concluded that Shoreham's operation would save $750
million in real economic costs over the first 15 years of its life.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission has
turned down a request to delay a new pricing scheme scheduled to go
into effect July 1 for the nation's largest long-distance company,
AT&amp;T.
   The requests for a stay had been filed in June by the Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. and La Telefonica Larga Distancia, which had said the
new plan to limit the prices American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. can
charge would put the two companies at a competitive disadvantage.
   But the FCC, in a decision made public Tuesday, concluded that
the companies failed to provide adequate reasons for a stay and the
public would benefit from the new pricing.
   AT&amp;T last month told the commission it would lower its prices by
$140 million on July 1. The price cap lets AT&amp;T, which in 1988
controlled 68 percent of the U.S. long-distance market, raise rates
3 percent less than the rate of inflation in three categories of
service: residential and small business; 800 calls; and other
business services, mainly for large customers.

<HEAD>Abortion Case Decision Is Among Five Anticipated Rulings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A case in which the Supreme Court is being
asked to overturn its landmark legalization of abortion is one of
five anticipated rulings separating the Supreme Court from its
three-month summer recess.
   Among the five is an important case over government-sponsored
religious displays that could move the barriers on the separation of
church and state.
   The possibility remains that one or more of the five cases in
which rulings are pending will not be decided Thursday, expected to
be the last day of the 1988-89 term.
   The justices could order that one or more of the cases be held
over and reargued in the court's next term, which begins in October.
If that occurs, a decision likely would not be announced until
sometime in 1990.
   In every Supreme Court term since 1977, at least one case has
been held over for reargument the following term.
   There is also the chance the court could take the highly unusual
step of leaving the announcement of a decision on any of the five
cases until Friday or an even later date.
   The last day of the term is also traditionally the day justices
have chosen to announce retirement. Three justices who have passed
their 80th birthdays _ William J. Brennan, who is 83, and Harry
Blackmun and Thurgood Marshall, both 80 _ are considered the most
likely candidates for retirement.
   The religion case, like all others this year, has been
overshadowed by a Missouri dispute in which the justices are being
asked to reverse the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   But a controversy over displaying a Christmas nativity scene and
a Hanukkah menorah at government buildings in Pittsburgh provides
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy his first opportunity to rule on a topic
that has so closely divided the court in recent years.
   And the court's ruling could affect more than religious displays
_ offering new guidelines about how high a wall the Constitution
erects between church and state.
   At issue are displays of a Christmas nativity scene inside the
Allegheny County Courthouse and a Hanukkah menorah on the front
steps of the City-County Building a few blocks away.
   The Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote in a 1984 decision, allowed
communities to include religious symbols in officially sponsored
holiday displays.
   The 1984 ruling in a Pawtucket, R.I., case involved a nativity
scene surrounded by secular symbols such as Santa Claus, reindeer
and snowmen. The Pittsburgh creche had been displayed by itself.
   Lower courts across the nation have been confused about just
where the 1984 ruling drew the line between permissible governmental
acknowledgment of religious heritages and the unconstitutional
promotion or advancement of religion.
   Most lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one,
and have disallowed various religious displays deemed too religious.
   The other three cases in which decisions are pending include:
   _A free-speech dispute over a New York state university ban on
some commercial activities in dormitory rooms. A federal appeals
court ruled that students' rights were violated when college
officials barred a cookware company from conducting its sales
pitches in dorm rooms.
   _A significant controversy to any state in which an Indian
reservation is located. At issue in a case from Washington state is
whether Indian tribes may control, through tribal zoning laws, the
use of land owned by non-Indians within a reservation's boundaries.
   _A pair of cases from Arkansas and Florida in which the justices
must decide whether businesses that successfully challenge state
taxes are entitled to collect refunds on taxes paid before they were
invalidated.

   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, a former
secretary of Housing and Urban Development, lobbied her old
department on behalf of a real estate firm trying to win federal
subsidies, her spokeswoman confirmed.
   ``They hired her because of her expertise. I don't see a story in
it,'' Clair Buchan said Tuesday night.
   Ms. Hills represented the company, Swezy Realty, in 1987 and 1988
when she was in private practice as a lawyer in Washington.
   The two projects were in Florida's Dade and Broward counties.
   Ms. Buchan said she believed one project won funds and one was
not approved, and she did not know their names or which was
successful. She also said she did not know how much money was
sought, or what Ms. Hills' fee was.
   The New York Times reported in its editions today that Ms. Hills
reported a fee of at least $5,000 from Swezy in her January
financial disclosure form.
   Ms. Hills is the first prominent Republican in the Bush
administration known to have acted as a lobbyist for developers
seeking HUD ``moderate rehabilitation'' funds under the Reagan
administration. The program is being investigated by Congress
following revelations that well-connected developers won tens of
millions of dollars in aid.
   Many Republican campaign advisers and former officials out of
office such as former Interior Secretary James Watt and former
Massachusetts Sen. Edward Brooke won six-figure fees for telephone
calls to HUD officials on behalf of their clients.
   Many of these consultants had no particular expertise in housing.

   President Bush's call for a proposed
constitutional amendment to forbid flag desecration would be the
first new amendment before states since 1985 if it passes Congress.
   A 1789 proposal to bar sitting members of Congress from raising
their pay is the only constitutional amendment pending before the
states.
   Six other proposed amendments have passed Congress by the
necessary two-thirds vote but failed to win ratification in the
required three-fourths of the states _ currently 38 of the 50 states.
   Bush called Tuesday for a constitutional amendment that would set
aside last week's Supreme Court decision and forbid desecration of
the American flag.
   Most proposed amendments expire if not ratified after seven
years. In the case of the one pending amendment, no expiration date
was set by Congress.
   The pay amendment, authored by James Madison, states: ``No law
varying the compensation for the services of the senators and
representatives shall take effect, until an election of
representatives shall have intervened.''
   Twenty-three states have approved the amendment, which consumer
advocate Ralph Nader and some state lawmakers have attempted to
revive in recent years during controversies over congressional pay.
   The last proposal to expire without enough states was a plan to
give the District of Columbia full voting rights in Congress. It
fell short by 22 states in 1985. The capital currently has a
non-voting delegate in the House.
   Before that, the Equal Rights Amendment fell three states short
in 1982.
   Four other amendments which were sent to the states but failed to
be ratified included a formula proposed in 1789 for determining the
number of House members; a ban suggested by the 11th Congress on
citizenship for anyone receiving a title of nobility or honor from
``any emperor, king, prince or foreign power;'' a bar proposed in
1861 on Congress interfering with the domestic institutions of any
state, including slavery, but slavery was abolished in 1865 by the
13th Amendment; and a 1924 proposal involving child labor
regulations.
   There also is a move afoot for a constitutional convention, which
must be called after a petition from two-thirds of the states.
Thirty-two of the required 34 states have applied to Congress. This
method has not yet been used to amend the Constitution.
   The Congressional Research Service said there were at least 9,994
proposed constitutional amendments introduced in Congress from 1789
through 1984, but the number is considered low because of poor
record-keeping in the early years.
   The Library of Congress says 155 such proposals have been
introduced since the 101st Congress began in January.

   Hours after a 7-year-old girl was swept into a
storm sewer, rescuers gave up plans to search for her in the
fast-flowing water and her mother abandoned hope.
   But Latricia Reese managed to cling to cracks in the lining of
the sewer for 12 hours while the flood waters from Tropical Storm
Allison swirled around her.
   ``It was a horrible night and a terrible storm, but we found a
rainbow at the end,'' said Karen Resse after two construction
workers found her daughter.
   ``I gave up most hope and everybody kept telling me not to give
it up, but I did,'' Mrs. Reese said Tuesday, while Latricia rested
in a hospital bed and watched cartoons.
   ``I just held on to the crack in the cement,'' Latricia said,
complaining that mosquitos and ants bothered her throughout her
ordeal.
   Latricia, her hands white and wrinkled and her body covered with
scrapes and bruises, was suffering mild shock Tuesday but was
reported in good condition at Humana Hospital-Southmore, said
spokeswoman Ramona Branch.
   The 4-foot-tall Latricia was playing in a flooded ditch near her
home around 7:30 p.m. Monday when her cousin saw her lose her
footing and vanish into an 18-inch concrete culvert.
   ``She spent the entire night in the city's major sewer system
with all that flood water coming in on her, and hardly had a
scratch,'' said Fire Department spokesman Mike Warnke. ``It's just a
miracle that she could still be alive.''
   When the police diving team was called out, the water was still
flowing at a rate they believed too hazardous to risk entering the
unfamiliar storm sewage system. Police thought the girl would have
been swept to where the sewer system empties into a bayou, Warnke
said.
   ``The diving team told me they can't do any more, it's too
dangerous for them. They told my friend they thought they should get
me a pastor because I would need it and it didn't look too good,''
Mrs. Reese said.
   She and a sister walked around a nearby bayou in search of the
girl at daylight Tuesday. Other relatives enlisted the help of two
construction workers checking sewer lines who removed manhole covers
near the spot where the girl disappeared and found her in the sewer
about 8 a.m.
   ``We used a flashlight and saw a little figure about 30 feet
under the street,'' said Timothy Gabrysch, who went into the drain
Tuesday morning. ``It was pitch dark and she couldn't see anything.
When she saw us, she ran to us.
   ``It's an experience I guess you can't explain. I have no idea
how she stayed there. It's pretty nasty down there. There's all
kinds of debris down there.''

<HEAD>Murder of Journalist Puts An End To Feared Intelligence Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico City's intelligence police had
weathered accusations from ordinary citizens of extortion,
kidnapping, torture, even murder _ surviving repeated calls for its
dismantling.
   But the unit could not overcome the ugly, politically charged
scandal of the 1984 murder of Manuel Buendia, a front-page columnist
and author who specialized in exposing wrongdoing in high places.
   Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis ordered the intelligence police
disbanded Tuesday after three commanders were charged in the tangled
assassination plot.
   He called their involvement ``intolerable.''
   The three commanders served under the alleged mastermind of the
Buendia killing, Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez, former director of the
now-defunct Federal Security Administration.
   Zorrilla, whose FBI-like agency was disbanded for corruption in
1985, is accused of ordering Buendia killed to stop the columnist
from exposing his links to drug lords.
   The commanders _ Juventino Prado Hurtado, Sofia Naya Suarez and
Raul Perez Carmona _ have all said they were tortured into
confessing their participation in what was code-named ``Operation
News.''
   Corruption and brutality are old, agonizing and acknowledged
problems among the low-paid, poorly trained Mexican police. When
reputed drug kingpin Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was arrested
earlier this year, the entire local police force in his hometown of
Culiacan was rounded up along with him.
   But even in a country where some fear cops as much as criminals,
Mexico City's intelligence police were regarded as particularly
dangerous.
   Critics said their main business was extortion.
   ``This is the fundamental reason they detain people,'' Rep.
Victor Orduna, chairman of the Justice Administration Committee of
the capital's city council, said in a recent interview.
   Orduna and Rep. Ramon Sosamontes, chairman of the council's
Public Safety Committee, say scores of citizens complained of
detention in clandestine jails, torture and extortion.
   Human rights organizations and lawyers reported similar
complaints.
   Some were verbal, others were filed with the city or the courts.
All were still pending when Camacho Solis finally ordered the unit
dismantled.
   Critics of the intelligence police had been hoping the taint of
the Buendia murder, a crime that shocked the nation and galvanized a
timid press into prodding two successive administrations for
justice, would accomplish what the complaints of ordinary people
failed to do.
   ``They are virtually gone,'' human rights lawyer Maria Teresa
Jardi told the AP after Zorrilla was indicted.
   By most accounts, the Intelligence Division was a crime-fighting
idea that went badly awry.
   High-ranking police sources who insisted on anonymity said some
of the roughest agents and officers in Zorrilla's disbanded Security
Administration were chosen for the intelligence police.
   The sources admitted privately that the attempt to harness those
elements had created a monster.
   ``In Mexican police circles there is this idea to control
delinquents, you need a worse delinquent,'' Orduna said. ``But this
division became a social problem for the city.''
   The intelligence police had image problems from it outset late
last year. Its original director was Miguel Nazar Haro, Zorrilla's
predecessor at the Security Administration and a veteran of the
harsh political repression of the 1970s.
   The appointment created an uproar.
   The Mexican Academy of Human Rights produced several people who
testified that Nazar Haro had personally tortured them. The press
pointed out that he was still wanted by authorities in Calfornia on
a federal indictment alleging he was in a ring that stole hundreds
of autos and smuggled them across the border.
   Officials of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's new
administration staunchly defended Nazar Haro as a smart veteran cop
and tough crime-fighter.
   ``We're simply trying to fight crime,'' Police Chief Javier
Garcia Paniagua said at the time. ``And we will be forceful.''
   The division's image took another sharp blow when its agents
helped quell a December prison riot 500 miles from Mexico City, in
Tepic. A videotape viewed by The Associated Press revealed that six
inmates died after surrendering.
   Nazar Haro resigned in late February but the intelligence police
were back in the headlines within weeks after agents detained nine
women on the way home from an illegal abortion clinic.
   Several of the women say they were beaten and their doctor was
tortured before their release without charges 14 hours later.
   Sosamontes and Orduna said the incident, which the police refused
to discuss, was designed to extort ``protection'' money from the
elderly doctor. They say he paid a substantial sum.
   The March abortion clinic incident prompted more demands for the
division's disbanding. City officials agreed instead to close its
infamous jail, Tlaxcoaque.
   Orduna said the closure created even more problems.
   ``Before, I knew where to look for people,'' he said recently.
``Now I don't know where to go. They say there are four new
clandestine jails, but we don't know precisely where they are.''

<HEAD>Police: 11 Shining Path Guerrillas Killed North of Lima</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police killed 11 Shining Path rebels and
captured five in Andean foothills north of the capital after the
insurgents attacked a town, killing two civilians, police said.
   Tuesday's gunbattle occurred near the town of Ambar, 100 miles
north of Lima, in an area the guerrillas had not previously been
active.
   Police said the guerrillas attacked Ambar, killing two people and
causing some property damage before fleeing. Police were dispatched
in helicopters to intercept the rebels, according to the police
statement.
   It identified one of the dead as Alfonso Mazoni, an area leader
of the Mao-inspired rebel organization, and said one of the five
captured guerrillas was a woman who had been wounded.
   The report also said police recovered a large cache of weapons
after the battle. It did not say whether there were police
casualties.
   The Shining Path began its insurgency in 1980 in the impoverished
highland area near Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima.
   The violence has since spread through much of the country, and
half of Peru's population lives in areas declared emergency zones
where the military is given broad powers to battle the guerrillas.
   In a battle Sunday, an army patrol killed 42 rebels in a remote
region of Ayacucho state, the government says. A military spokesman
said it was one of the biggest losses suffered by the Shining Path
since the group took up arms.
   Last week, a rebel column ambushed an army convoy near the town
of Aguaytia, 270 miles northeast of Lima in Peru's jungle region.
Twenty rebels and 15 soldiers were killed in the fighting.
   Guerrilla activity has been minimal in the coastal areas north
and south of the capital. The rebels mount most of their attacks in
the central and southern highlands and in the coca-growing jungle
regions northeast of Lima.
   Tuesday's battle occurred in arid foothills 30 miles east of the
coastal city of Huacho.
   More than 15,000 people have been killed in the fighting,
including soldiers, police, rebels, public officials and peasants
caught in the crossfire between troops and guerrillas.

<HEAD>Airlines Cut Crucial `Rain Man' Airport Scene to Soothe Passengers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 9th graf, `One airline ...' to restore dropped word `make'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crucial scene from the Oscar-winning ``Rain
Man'' has been excised from the version shown by at least 15 major
airlines because the scene about aviation safety was considered
unfit for passengers.
   In the four-minute ``Rain Man'' sequence, Dustin Hoffman's
autistic savant character refuses to board a plane because he has
memorized airplane crash statistics.
   Pressured by his brother Charlie Babbitt, played by Tom Cruise,
Hoffman's Raymond Babbitt panics and starts screaming and thrashing
about.
   ``I think it's a key scene to the entire movie. That's why it's
in there,'' Barry Levinson, the film's Academy Award-winning
director, said in a telephone interview Tuesday. ``It launches their
entire odyssey across country _ because they couldn't fly.
   ``Without that scene, it comes down to this: You basically lose
an enormous impact of the film. That scene tells you that they,
mechanically, are forced to drive across country and, secondly, that
Charlie can only push Raymond so far because he knows what will
happen.''
   Furthermore, the deletion of the scene makes later references to
it nonsensical.
   ``Rain Man'' started showing on airplanes in June and is now
being screened regularly on 15 carriers, said Don Sathern,
supervisor of visual programming for Sony-Trans Com Inc., the
nation's largest in-flight movie service.
   ``Everybody wanted the scene out,'' he said. ``Usually,
plane-crash sequences are automatically out.''
   One airline spokeswoman said it was the sort of scene that
typically could make passengers uneasy.
   ``It's our policy to remove portions of feature films as they
relate to violence, nudity, obscenities or anything that could
create discomfort for passengers about being on airplanes,''
Patricia Graham, manager of in-flight programming for United
Airlines, said in this week's People magazine.
   Levinson said he didn't have the authority to insist that the
scene be restored. ``We can't do anything about it,'' he said.
Still, he found the editing ridiculous.
   ``These airlines don't know that supposedly there is a degree of
risk?'' Levinson asked. ``They've never heard of such a thing? We're
saying that over the years, planes have crashed. That is a reality
of life.''
   In the airport scene, Charlie, the hustler brother tries to
prevail on his autistic sibling to board an airliner. Raymond was
adamant.
   ``Airline travel is very dangerous.''
   ``Don't be silly,'' Charlie snaps. ``It's the safest in the
world. You're going to love this. Trust me.''
   Raymond remains steadfast in his travel phobia, citing 30 air
crashes in 1987 and 211 fatalities.
   One airline is showing ``Rain Man'' with the scene intact:
Qantas, which Raymond singles out for the best safety record.
   ``Qantas?'' Charlie demanded in exasperation.
   ``Never crashed,'' Raymond muttered.

   Carrie Bray was looking for real-life
cowboys when she came to Cheyenne but the closest the 14-year-old
Texan got was a peek inside the ``Howdy Wagon'' parked in front of
the chamber of commerce.
   ``There's got to be some cowboys around here somewhere,'' the
Dallas teen-ager said during a recent visit with her mother.
   Sorry. Tourists lured to Cheyenne to ``Live the Legend'' are
finding there's little legend to live in the southeastern Wyoming
city of 47,000 residents.
   City officials know they're letting tourists down and admit they
might be deceiving them with the advertising slogan.
   ``Can they `Live the Legend?' No,'' said Mayor Gary Schaeffer.
``As soon as people start making up slogans, there's a perception of
problems or they wouldn't need a slogan. We have to give them what
they need to live it.''
   Realizing the western deficiency of the Cowboy State's capital,
civic leaders are beefing up frontier activities and sinking
thousands of dollars into marketing surveys and tourist promotions.
   ``People who come here from the East expect to see the Old West _
like they see it on television _ dirt streets, swinging saloon
doors,'' said Scott Binning, director of the Cheyenne Visitors
Council. ``Some are totally disappointed because we have paved
streets, electric lights and running water.''
   So, Cheyenne this summer will have mounted police riding the
streets; mock gunslingers _ many of them real estate agents and
carpenters _ shooting it out at high noon in the town square; and,
for the first time in years, horses to rent.
   ``I've talked to tourists and most of 'em didn't believe there
wasn't a place they could ride,'' said Wrangler-clad Jim Talkington,
who opened his Blue Ribbon horse farm 10 miles west of Cheyenne to
trail rides a few weeks ago. ``They were aghast they couldn't ride a
horse in Cheyenne.''
   Minta Garner, a teacher from Memphis, Tenn., said she was
expecting to see sagebrush, plains, horses and cattle.
   ``I felt more like the Old West out on the open range than I do
here in town,'' she said.
   The mayor, a Pennsylvania native, has issued a proclamation
encouraging residents to say ``howdy'' instead of ``hello'' and to
dress western throughout July, which climaxes with the ``Daddy of
'Em All,'' the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo.
   But not all residents are receptive, Schaeffer said, adding he
was almost strung up when he suggested building wooden sidewalks
downtown.
   Some members of the business community would rather be viewed as
a burgeoning city on the verge of economic greatness and cultural
sophistication, he said.
   State Sen. Win Hickey, a member of the Cheyenne Downtown
Development Association, said a little western flare is fine, ``but
by no means should we lose sight that we're living in the 21st
century.
   ``If everyone wore western clothes, and horses and carriages rode
downtown, it might be fun to come and look at but I can't believe
they would say this is a progressive city and I would like to invest
in it,'' she said. ``There needs to be a melding of what would
attract the tourists, but not detract the business person.''
   Others say Cheyenne already provides a glimpse into the Old West.
   State Rep. Don Sullivan of Cheyenne, the chairman of the local
historical society, said the city's mansions, museums and railroads
are rich in the lore of cattle barons, rustlers and hangmen.
   ``Can you come and play cowboys? The answer is no. We don't have
guys in black hats killing each other on 16th Street,'' he said.
   ``But there is an aura, an impression that people have of a true
old western community and in all the best senses that is very much
deserved. It's clean living, clean life, healthy people.''
   Ed Johnson, 28, from Port Washington, Wis., got a taste of that.
   ``I hear that the people out West are friendlier and everyone I
passed on the street said hello.''
   But not howdy.

<HEAD>Elliott Thorpe, Who Warned of Pearl Harbor, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Brig. Gen. Elliott Thorpe, a
much-decorated military leader who delivered an unheeded warning
about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, has died at age 91.
   Thorpe died Tuesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital, which did not
immediately release the cause of death.
   Thorpe was the last surviving member of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's
staff and may have been the last living witness to the signings of
the peace treaties ending both wars. In post-World War II Japan he
was responsible for Emperor Hirohito, and outlived his former charge
by about six months.
   As a first lieutenant in the army, Thorpe stood guard in the Hall
of Mirrors at Versailles when the World War I treaty was signed on
June 28, 1919. In 1945, he was on the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay when
the Japanese surrendered to MacArthur.
   Thorpe was a military attache in Dutch-controlled Java in
December 1941, when the Dutch broke a Japanese diplomatic code. One
of the intercepted messages referred to planned Japanese attacks on
Hawaii, the Philippines, and Thailand.
   Informed of the message by a Dutch general, Thorpe immediately
cabled the information to Washington. But he found that his warning
was not taken seriously. A week later, the Japanese attacked Pearl
Harbor.
   As MacArthur's chief of civil intelligence in postwar Japan,
Thorpe played a major role in reorganizing Japanese society. He was
in charge of Emperor Hirohito's security, controlled his comings and
goings and determined who could visit him. Hirohito died Jan. 7 at
87.
   Thorpe set up a screening system to keep militarists out of the
Japanese government, supervised the release of political prisoners
and helped determine which Japanese officials should be tried as war
criminals.
   Thorpe was a native of Westerly, R.I. His military career began
with the outbreak of World War I, when he left the University of
Rhode Island to enlist in the army.
   Prior to World War II, Thorpe was lend-lease commissioner and
U.S. military attache in the Netherlands East Indies, now Indonesia.
After his service in Japan, Thorpe established the Army Language
School and was military attache in Thailand. In 1969, he wrote
``East Wind, Rain,'' an account of his years as an intelligence
officer.
   Thorpe was awarded numerous medals and citations during his
career, including the Purple Heart, a Bronze Star, a Gold Star and
the Distinguished Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster.
   After retiring to Sarasota in the 1960s, Thorpe served as a
commissioner with the Whitfield Volunteer Fire Department, and
devoted time to his favorite hobbies _ reading, writing and golf.
Thorpe also wrote ``Shipwrecks off Rhode Island,'' ``The
Irish-American War'' and ``Mr. Wilson's War.''
   Thorpe was visited frequently by journalists and historians who
viewed him as a valuable resource for information on MacArthur and
wartime intelligence.
   Thorpe will be buried in Arlington National Cemetary in
Washington, D.C. Plans for services were incomplete.

<TEXT>
   A strike immobilized all of Britain's railroads
today and virtually all of London's subway network, forcing millions
of commuters to drive, cycle, walk or ride buses to work.
   It was the second 24-hour strike in eight days by 75,000 national
railroad workers and the eighth unofficial walkout in 12 weeks by
the capital's 10,500 subway workers.
   Traffic jams in London started two hours early and traffic ``is
definitely heavier than usual,'' said Scotland Yard spokeswoman
Alison Bland.
   Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow also
reported earlier rush hours with more traffic congestion than
normal, the Automobile Association said.
   Last Wednesday, there was little of the traffic chaos that might
have been expected from a triple-barreled strike that hit the
national railroad and London's buses and subways. Many commuters
carefully planned their journeys, and others simply stayed at home.
   This week, major companies again hired fleets of coaches to bring
in staff, and London hotels were full of employees spending the
night in the city to beat the strike.
   The 248-station subway system carries 2.7 million passengers a
day, while rail services are used by some 2 million people.
   A sharply reduced subway service was operating on two of London's
10 subway lines, said London Underground spokesman David Morris.
   London's buses, which carry 3.2 million people daily, appeared to
be working normally today, and special shuttle services were added
between Victoria Station in central London and the southern suburb
of Wimbledon, where the two-week lawn tennis championships opened
Monday.
   ``I think it's absolutely disgraceful that people in the
transport unions don't think about their fellow citizens,'' Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher told Sky News, the cable television
network.
   ``It's the public sector unions that are the problem ... Those
people are there to serve the public but they don't,'' she said.
   The National Union of Railwaymen is striking against state-owned
British Rail's offer of a 7 percent wage hike, and union leader
Jimmy Knapp is demanding a pay rise of at least 10 percent.
   The subway workers want a $99 weekly increase to operate without
a guard. Management is offering $46 a week plus 14 days extra annual
vacation, but is tying the raise to increase productivity.
   The union plans another one-day strike on July 5 unless British
Rail raises its pay offer.

   President Bush seems more interested in defending
the flag than defending the ideas the flag represents, say civil
rights leaders who heard a speech by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   In his address Tuesday to Operation PUSH, Thornburgh said the
Bush administration wouldn't immediately pursue legislation to
overturn controversial U.S. Supreme Court rulings on job
discrimination.
   Thornburgh said the administration wanted to first assess the
impact of the high court rulings on anti-discrimination laws.
   Jesse Jackson, founder of the Chicago-based Operation PUSH,
expressed disappointment with Thornburgh's ``wait-and-see'' message.
He and others contrasted it with Bush's immediate call for a
constitutional amendment to set aside last week's Supreme Court
ruling nullifying flag desecration laws in 48 states.
   ``We cannot help but notice the haste with which Bush has rushed
to defend the flag, and his lack of haste in defending the substance
that flag stands for, which is equality under the law and
fairness,'' Jackson said after Thornburgh's speech.
   In his speech, Thornburgh said the administration ``is fully
committed to eliminating every form of discrimination in our
society.''
   But while acknowledging that some people view the recent high
court decisions as a retreat in the battle for civil rights, he
urged caution.
   ``I recognize, as does the president, that the full effect of
these rulings will not be felt until they are applied in new
cases,'' the attorney general said.
   ``In fact, the president has asked that I monitor the
implementation of these opinions in the lower courts to assess their
impact on equal employment opportunities and, if needed, to suggest
any legislative or executive action that might be required to
resolve inequities,'' he said.
   Bush made similar comments in Washington earlier in the day.
   ``I am strongly committed to equal opportunity for all
Americans,'' Bush said, adding that he had been advised in a Justice
Department report that the Supreme Court decisions didn't undermine
those principles.
   Thornburgh received a generally polite but cool reception from
the audience of about 200.
   Several delegates to the convention said they believed Thornburgh
was speaking for Bush, and not for himself.
   ``Clearly, the Dick Thornburgh that I heard this morning was not
the Dick Thornburgh I have known in the past,'' said Richard
Hatcher, former mayor of Gary, Ind. ``The only conclusion I can
reach is that it was a speech that was crafted at the White House.
I, personally, felt he was a little uncomfortable with it.''
   Hatcher added: ``For the president to call for a constitutional
amendment _ that's a pretty serious step. I can't help but feel that
he is showing greater compassion regarding an inanimate object _
precious though the flag is to all of us _ than he is to some 22
million citizens of this country.''
   Jackson, who declined to criticize Thornburgh, called for an
effort to persuade Congress to enact legislation that would set
aside the recent high court decisions.
   The Supreme Court has invalidated minority set-aside quotas for
local public works contracts, made it harder for plaintiffs to prove
employment discrimination and given white males the right to
challenge affirmative action plans previously approved by courts.
   During a discussion after Thornburgh's speech, Rutgers University
law professor Arthur Kinoy loudly compared the administration's
``wait-and-see response'' to the reaction after 19th century Supreme
Court decisions that dismantled Reconstruction legislation.
   The high court decisions included the 1896 ruling that upheld
``separate but equal'' facilities for blacks and whites.
   Thornburgh responded angrily.
   ``You are free to question the integrity and commitment of the
president and the attorney general,'' Thornburgh said. ``But I don't
think it adds to the kind of dialogue that we are seeking to engage
in to reduce this to the level of shouting matches.''

<HEAD>Bomb Rack Out of Adjustment Caused F-16 to Drop Bomb Accidentally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRANTLEY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force officials blame a bomb rack that
was out of adjustment and contained a worn-out part for an accident
last month in which a jet fighter dropped a live, 500-pound bomb
accidentally.
   The bomb exploded May 4 near the small west Georgia town of
Brantley and flattened some trees, but caused no injuries or major
damage.
   The Air Force subsequently has tested the bomb rack on the F-16
jet and regularly replaced the suspect part. But the planes will
continue to fly practice bombing runs into Fort Benning, passing
over the Marion County area east of the post.
   ``We're looking at alternate ways of getting there. ... We've
discussed that. But no decision has been made,'' Col. Joe Prater,
commander of the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Moody Air
Force Base near Valdosta, said Tuesday.
   The bomb exploded 40 feet above the ground when it hit a tree,
scarring and knocking down trees for 100 yards in every direction.
   A summary of the findings of an investigation of the accident
undertaken by Moody Air Force Base officials was released Tuesday in
Washington, D.C.
   Prater, who oversaw the probe, said the cause likely was the
alignment of the bomb rack and the likely deterioration of a
rubberized ``O-ring'' that may have caused the bomb to get hung up
and then fall unexpectedly.

   China has recalled all its ambassadors home, and
China's ambassador, Yang Zhenya, will therefore return to Beijing in
a few days, the Kyodo News Service reported today.
   In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment on the
report.
   China has come under intense international criticism for
violently crushing the pro-democracy movement early this month,
rounding up hundreds of activists. A week ago, China urged the more
than 20 Chinese diplomats who have since defected abroad to return
home, saying they were led astray by misinformation.
   Kyodo said Yang informed Education Minister Takeo Nishioka of the
recall in a meeting today.
   He told Nishioka that all Chinese ambassadors have been recalled
home and that he too will be returning to China on Friday, the
Japanese news service quoted an unidentified Education Ministry
official as saying.
   Kyodo also said Yang promised his government would continue to
provide funds and administrative support for Chinese students in
Japan who have joined demonstrations in support of the pro-democracy
movement.
   Chinese troops crushed the movement June 3 with an assault on
protesters in central Beijing in which hundreds of unarmed civilians
were killed.
   Government officials say more than 7,700 Chinese students are
studying at Japanese universities or colleges, nearly 600 of them
under Chinese government-sponsored programs for study abroad.
   Hundreds of Chinese students in Japan have held rallies and
demonstrations, calling on the Chinese government to end the
repression.

<HEAD>Russian Prince Among Last Of Romanov Empire, Dead at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOODSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Vasili Romanov, the last Russian
prince born in Russia before the revolution that ended his family's
300-year rule, has died at age 81.
   The nephew of Czart Nicholas II died in bed of natural causes
Saturday, said his daughter, Marina Beadleston of Aspen, Colo.
   Romanov was hopeful to the end of his life about the future of
his homeland, ruled by his family from 1613 until the Bolshevik
revolution of 1917.
   ``It's a very exciting time we live in,'' he said in a recent
interview, speaking of the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   The prince, the son of Grand Duchess Xenia, sister of the last
czar, was born in a 1,000-room palace in 1907. His father, Grand
Duke Alexander, was the founder of the Russian air force; his
grandfather was Czar Alexander III. His great-uncles were the kings
of England, Greece and Denmark.
   Nicholas, Empress Alexandra and their five children were
assassinated by the revolutionaries.
   The family of young Romanov was rescued by a British battleship
sent by their British relative, King George V.
   Later, Romanov went to sea as a cabin boy. He worked in the
shipyards of San Francisco and as a stockbroker in that city, as a
winemaker near San Jose and a chicken farmer in Sonoma.
   ``In my colorful career, I think I enjoyed the chicken farm the
most,'' he said in the interview.
   Romanov's wife, Princess Natasha, escaped to China from Siberia
riding in boxcars. He proposed to her in a speakeasy during
Prohibition. His death followed hers by a few months.
   Romanov leaves his daughter and four grandchildren. Services will
be on July 7, his birthday, in Holy Trinity Cathedral in San
Francisco.

<HEAD>New Texas Law Allows Police to Withhold Names of Felony Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICE GRAVINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new state law that allows police to
withhold the names of crime victims went into effect quietly earlier
this month but is creating an uproar.
   The law, which amends the Texas Open Records Act, allows
government agencies to keep confidential the identities of victims
of felonies, including homicide.
   Police also can withhold information that could lead to victims'
identification, such as addresses. The bill went into effect June 14.
   Generally, the news media voluntarily withholds the names only of
victims of sex crimes.
   One of the sponsors, Rep. Fred Blair, said the bill was aimed at
protecting crime victims from harassment, whether by reporters'
questions or from other sources, such as security companies. He said
victims or their families could release the information, but it
otherwise would not be public unless it reached the courts.
   ``A lot of crimes go unreported because the victims just don't
want to go through it,'' Blair said. ``I was thinking about the
victims. I wasn't thinking about anybody else.''
   ``I think the law is outrageous and I hope law enforcement
agencies will choose to ignore it until this serious challenge to
freedom of information can be corrected,'' Jack Loftis, editor and
vice president of the Houston Chronicle, said in a telephone
interview Tuesday.
   The Chronicle waged a lengthy court battle in recent years to
obtain records from the Houston Police Department.
   In Amarillo, reporters and editors said that authorities would
not release the names of people involved in a fatal car accident
last weekend because of the law.
   ``If I hadn't been familiar with the case already, I would have
been out of luck,'' said John Hagerty of KFDA-TV. ``It really ties
our hands.''
   Dennis Spies, managing editor of the Amarillo Daily News, said
his reporters encountered similar problems with police, who refused
to give the name of the woman killed in the accident because a
suspected drunken driver was charged with involuntary manslaughter,
a felony.
   The paper finally got the names of the woman and her critically
injured husband from a funeral home, Spies said.
   Spies also said police refused to disclose the names of five
people injured in a knife fight at an Amarillo nightclub Monday.
   ``I'm sure (lawmakers) had good intentions,'' Spies said. ``But
it's not helping our readers any ... it affects everybody.''
   Blair said he believes some law enforcement agencies are
misinterpreting the law's intent and that authorities should be more
liberal in releasing such information.
   ``There is so much misinformation on the bill. Various
departments are still studying it,'' Blair said. Departments that
are withholding information ``have already just across-the-board,
broadly interpreted using the bill that way.''
   Blair said that, under the House counsel's interpretation, the
names of the crash victims should have been released by authorities.
   Police spokesmen in Austin and San Antonio have said they are
studying the law before changing any policies. In Midland, Deputy
Chief John Smith said police were not aware of it.
   The Texas Department of Public Safety, which asked for a state
attorney general's interpretation of the law, told troopers to
withhold the names of people killed or injured in drunken-driving
accidents, said spokesman Mike Cox.
   Ira Perry, regional director of the Society of Professional
Journalists, said he expected several media groups to fight the
measure.
   ``We're getting calls from everywhere, either about problems or
from news media saying, `what is going on here?''' said Sharon
Jayson, chairwoman of Texas Media, a freedom-of-information lobby
for several statewide news associations. She said the group Tuesday
was discussing how to respond to the law.
   Gov. Bill Clements said Tuesday that if asked, he'll consider
putting the issue on the agenda of the special legislative session
that began last week.
   ``Certainly, (Clements) realized what he was signing, but ...
there was no opposition voiced'' during the bill's journey through
the House and Senate, said Rossanna Salazar, the governor's deputy
press secretary.

<HEAD>Bottle-Nosed Dolphin Attracts Stream of Admirers and Curious Onlookers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wayward bottle-nosed dolphin that has made the
East River home for the last week has attracted a steady stream of
admirers and curious onlookers, who ooh and aah as it leaps from the
water.
   When it jumps in a graceful arc, there are excited shouts of
``There he is!'' and ``Hey, Flipper!''
   John Soto, a security guard, is one of the dolphin's most devoted
admirers.
   Ever since it was spotted in the East River June 20, he has been
on the esplanade from sunrise to sunset in the vicinity of 96th
Street to watch the creature he has named ``Dolfie.''
   ``I got my binoculars, a nice bench and I've been watching her
every single day,'' said Soto. ``This is my vacation spot right
here.''
   The 5-foot-long dolphin on Monday stubbornly resisted marine
biologists' efforts to herd it out of the murky river waters to open
sea by banging on pipes in the water.
   The experts don't know why the creature won't leave the small
area in the river south of Wards Island, said Sam Sadove, the
research director at the Okeanos Ocean Research Foundation Inc. on
New York's Long Island.
   He said it's possible the dolphin's sonar is impaired.
   Another theory is that the sonar is working but ``is picking up
changes in the water that make it think there is a barrier,'' he
added.
   Based on tests on the water Monday, marine biologists determined
that the animal could remain in the river for up to three to four
weeks without serious impact.
   But if the dolphin becomes stressed, its chances of survival
decline.
   ``It can die very quickly. It's just like a human in shock with
changes in color, pallor and breathing rate,'' Sadove said.
   Nelson Hernandez, an 11-year-old who wants to be a marine
biologist when he grows up, is also concerned the river could mean
death for the dolphin.
   ``They say the water is dirty so he might be dying. This water
may be polluting his body,'' said the youngster as he leaned over
the esplanade railing to see the animal better.
   Gregory Rivera, a doorman who lives in the neighborhood, pointed
with amazement at the dolphin when he spotted it for the first time.
``There it is! See him? Right there.''
   Myram Pochynok, a New York Telephone employee munching on pizza
during his lunch break, also joined the excitement, saying:
   ``It's one of the best things to hit the East River. You usually
see all kinds of other stuff floating in the water. It's nice to see
something that belongs there.''
   Dolphins certainly belong in the water, but not in the East
River's water, marine experts said. And Sadove said the foundation
will continue its efforts to drive the dolphin to sea as soon as it
has assembled the necessary equipment.
   Plans include use of large underwater speakers to play the scary
sounds of killer whales in hopes that the dolphin will swim away
from them and toward the ocean, he said.
   If that doesn't work, marine biologists will string 100 yards of
acoustic pingers between two boats to create a moving wall of sound.
   ``We would move that wall progressively toward the dolphin in the
direction we want him to swim,'' Sadove explained.
   The Okeanos foundation said it would take about a week to arrange
for the sound equipment. The next attempt to move the dolphin has
been set for July 5.
   As a last resort, Sadove said, the marine experts would try to
capture the dolphin.

<TEXT>
   It wasn't love at first bite for two rare
Sumatran tigers matched through an animal-mating computer service,
but zoo officials here are confident the affair will blossom with
time.
   Dutch, a 4-year-old male from Blidorp Zoo in Rotterdam, Holland,
met German-born Tuka, 10, on Monday in the tiger display at the
Lowry Park Zoological Garden.
   The two initially faced off warily. Tuka growled. Dutch took a
swim.
   ``She's snarling in a defensive posture,'' explained zoo curator
Lex Salisbury. ``They could fight, but other tiger introductions
have been pretty good.''
   The tigers are indigenous to the Asian island of Sumatra and
number about 700 in the wild, said Salisbury. Seventy of the
endangered animals are in captivity; 50 of those live in North
American zoos.
   The tigers are hunted for their rich orange-and-black striped
coats, and are being pushed out of their forest habitat by
development.
   Dutch was donated to the zoo May 11, and Tuka was loaned
indefinitely six months ago by the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   The matchmaker was the American Association of Zoological Parks
and Aquariums in Apple Valley, Minn.
   Its 3-year-old computer program is called ARKS (Animal Record
Keeping System).
   One goal is to reintroduce babies produced by computer couples
back into the wild, Salisbury said.
   Before their first date, the tigers had only sniffed each other
``nose to nose'' in separate cages, Salisbury said.
   ``It may be a while before they warm up, and before they mate,''
Salisbury said, after Dutch ignored Tuka to plunge into a moat.
``They could breed tomorrow or a few months from now. There's also a
remote chance that they won't breed at all.''

<TEXT>
   Members of a military tribunal have called for the
court-martial and execution of a highly decorated senior general who
admitted to trafficking in cocaine, ivory, diamonds and other
contraband.
   Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, 57, told the panel of his peers that he had
betrayed the revolution he held so dear but that none of his actions
were meant to discredit it or the government of Fidel Castro.
   State-run television has broadcast segments of the hearing before
the 47 generals and admirals that began Sunday, including a
30-minute statement by Ochoa, who was charged with masterminding
smuggling operations run by officers.
   Cuban media said viewers unaccustomed to such public show trials
were transfixed by the proceedings against one of Cuba's most
decorated war heroes.
   Ochoa received one of his country's highest honors for his work
as commander of Cuban troops in Angola in 1987-88, where Cuba
supported the Marxist government against Western-backed rebels.
   ``If this (death) sentence were to come, which could even even
include a firing squad, my last throught will be for Fidel and our
great revolution,'' the general told the tribunal in the statement
broadcast Tuesday night.
   Throughout the hearing, Ochoa looked dejected, sometimes toying
with a piece of string as members of the panel talked.
   On Tuesday, the tribunal ruled that Ochoa had committed treason
and recommended he be court-martialed.
   Witnesses who testified during the hearing said that, beginning
as early as 1985, Ochoa was in league with Colombian drug bosses and
had helped turn Cuba into a way station for U.S.-bound cocaine.
   The government news agency Prensa Latina said Tuesday that
officers who testified before the tribunal all said Ochoa had
persuaded them to raise dollars ``at all costs'' to help this
Communist nation's troubled economy.
   In addition to drug trafficking, Ochoa is accused of overseeing a
thriving black market trade in supplies provided to the troops he
commanded in Angola.
   Prensa Latina said he traded fuel, dried fish and beef, weapons,
electronics and other supplies for diamonds and dollars.
   The witnesses said some of the money he made ended up a
Panamanian bank account. Some was used to buy refrigerators and
stereos for Ochoa and other officers, they said.
   Some of the generals on the tribunal were angered by the
testimony, while others choked backed tears.
   Some younger officers said they rose through the ranks regarding
Ochoa as a hero. Older officers mentioned their 30-year friendships
with Ochoa and their common combat experience dating to the
guerrilla war in the Sierra Maestra that ended with the 1959 victory
of the Castro-led revolution.
   Nearly to a man, however, they recommended that Ochoa be stripped
of his rank and honors and be dishonorably discharged. Most asked
that he be given the maximum penalty _ death by firing squad.
   ``One pays for treason with one's life,'' said Ochoa, whose voice
grew husky at times.
   He told the panel he was ashamed of his actions and recognized
his mistakes, but denied he wanted to embarrass the government: ``It
was to be expected that the enemy would try to use this. But nothing
is further from the truth than this having been for political
motives.''
   The general also denied the Castros or any other top-level Cuban
government officials were involved in drug-running.
   ``Neither the commander-in-chief (Fidel Castro) nor the (defense)
minister, nor the party, nor the armed forces, ever had anything to
do with this ... I wanted to make this clear before you,'' Ochoa
told his colleagues.
   Authorities had said the court-martial proceedings might begin
Tuesday, but by early today there was no word that they had begun.
   Defense Minister Raul Castro, brother of the president, testified
that Ochoa's punishment should ``set an example.''
   The tribunal recommended that the ``full weight of the law'' be
applied because of the ``extreme seriousness of his crimes.''
   Capt. Jorge Martinez Valdez, Ochoa's assistant, had testified
that Ochoa began laundering money with Panamanians and Colombians in
1985.
   He said Ochoa had direct contacts with leaders of the Medellin
cartel, the world's largest cocaine-smuggling operation. He said the
Colombian drug lords ``thought that we were official representatives
of Cuba.''

<HEAD>Hurt Trial Ends with Former Wife Saying He Did Not Want to Marry
Jennings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former wife of actor William Hurt has
testified that he vowed never to marry again at a meeting in which
Hurt discussed his lover's pregnancy.
   Actress Mary Beth Hurt said Tuesday she had urged her
then-husband to marry former ballerina Sandra Jennings, but he
rejected the idea.
   Ms. Jennings, a former dancer with the New York City Ballet, is
suing Hurt for a divorce based on four weeks they lived together in
Beaufort, S.C., while Hurt was filming ``The Big Chill.''
   Ms. Hurt's testimony was the last heard by state Judge Jacqueline
Silbermann, who will rule alone in the case.
   Ms. Hurt said that, except for a brief reconciliation in 1978,
she and Hurt had been separated since 1975. When she asked him at
the September 1982 meeting why he wanted to complete the divorce at
that time, he replied, ``Because Sandy's having a baby,'' Ms. Hurt
testified.
   ``Do you intend to marry her?'' Ms. Hurt said she asked.
   ``No,'' Hurt responded.
   ``I said, `Marry her, Bill.'''
   ``He said, `No. I'm finished with marriage.' ''
   Ms. Jennings, 32, says the common-law marriage began under South
Carolina law Dec. 9, 1982, when Hurt learned he was divorced. They
left South Carolina Jan. 10, 1983. The couple have a 6-year-old son,
Alexander.
   If the judge finds there was a marriage, she could give Ms.
Jennings a piece of Hurt's income from the past 6{ years. Ms.
Jennings' lawyer, Richard Golub, says Hurt, 39, has assets of about
$10 million.
   Ms. Hurt's testimony appeared to support Hurt's contention that
he never considered Ms. Jennings his wife and never intended to
marry her.
   Also Tuesday, movie producer Tim Zinnemann testified that Hurt
told actress May Kay Place at a baby shower for Ms. Jennings in
Beaufort to ``mind your own business'' when she asked whether Hurt
planned to marry his lover.
   Zinnemann, who married actress Meg Tilly in Beaufort during the
filming of ``The Big Chill,'' said the possibility of a double
wedding with Hurt and Ms. Jennings was discussed.

   A 16-month-old boy snatched from his stroller in
a hospital was reunited with his mother after she made a televised

   Christian Galvin was kidnapped Tuesday morning from the lobby of
Elmhurst General Hospital, while his mother was buying ice cream in
an alcove about 10 feet away.
   ``She turned her head for a moment, when she turned back the
child was gone,'' said Inspector Charles R. Prestia, head of
detectives in the Queens borough.
   The child was found wandering in the street around midnight by
passers-by about a mile away, who contacted police. Christian
apparently was not harmed.
   A witness earlier had seen a woman carrying the child out of the
hospital lobby. The pleas of the mother, Marilyn Galvin, 28, were
carried by local TV stations.
   Ms. Galvin, who is four months pregnant, was at the hospital for
a prenatal checkup.

   A gas explosion in a small coal mine in central
China killed 22 people and injured three, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported today.
   It quoted the Shanxi province's Coal Industry Bureau as saying
the explosion occurred Saturday in a village-run coal mine in the
suburbs of Jincheng, a city 370 miles southwest of Beijing.
   The cause of the explosion was under investigation, Xinhua said.
   Coal mine disasters are common in China, where most mines lack
modern equipment and safety provisions.
   More than 4,000 miners died in accidents in 1988, the worst year
for mine disasters in 40 years of communist rule.

<HEAD>Log Export Ban Moves to Congress After Voter Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debate over the export of logs grown on
state and federal forests in Oregon shifts to Congress after voters
gave overwhelming support to a measure intended to save jobs at
local mills.
   The measure, which would ban the export of logs cut from
state-owned forests, will become effective only if Congress adopts
enabling legislation. The ban would not effect logs already
processed into lumber.
   The measure also calls on Congress to permanently ban the export
of logs grown on the national forests and other federal timberlands.
The Bush administration has proposed lifting the annual ban on
exporting federal logs to boost federal revenue by an estimated $200
million.
   In Tuesday's election, a count of 99 percent of the votes showed
the measure passing with 421,991, or 90 percent, to 44,604, or 10
percent.
   ``This is the greatest present Oregon could give me trying to get
this bill through,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., adding he has
lined up 20 co-sponsors for the bill on federal log exports and 16
for the bill on state exports.
   Financing for the $800,000 Citzens to Save Oregon Jobs campaign
came largely from non-exporting timber companies afraid that failure
of the measure could have led to a lifting of the ban on federal log
exports.
   Weyerhaeuser Co. spokesman Kelly Conover said the proposal to
keep logs grown on Oregon state forests exclusively for use in
Oregon mills faced constitutional problems because it created a
barrier to interstate commerce.
   Conover said counties and school districts receiving revenues
from the sale of logs grown on state forests were likely to go to
court to protest the loss of the premium prices paid by buyers from
Japan, China and Korea.
   ``The campaign spent $1.5 million and failed to tell Oregonians
what their real problem is for the industry, which is federal timber
supply,'' Conover said.
   Federal logs are already in short supply because of court
injunctions barring timber sales in old growth forests that
environmentalists say are critical to the survival of the rare
Northern spotted owl.
   The U.S. Forest Service has estimated that lifting the ban on
federal log exports could send an additional 1 billion board feet of
raw timber from Oregon and Washington forests to Japan, China and
Korea.
   About 1.3 billion board feet of logs from Oregon, primarily cut
on private lands, were exported last year out of a statewide harvest
of 9 billion board feet. Of the state forest harvest of 220 million
board feet, about half was exported.
   The measure drew no organized opposition, but the Pacific Rim
Trade Association complained that supporters misled the public about
the threat of state log exports to domestic mill jobs.

   One by one they emerged from the airport
terminal, most leaning heavily on crutches with just one leg. They
are victims of a tragedy that began almost seven months ago as the
earth shook under Armenia.
   Bound for surgery in Israel, these survivors of the Dec. 7
earthquake that killed 25,000 people and injured thousands more are
still haunted by visions of collapsing buildings.
   They bear the scars of emergency surgery and are left with stumps
that promise a life as social misfits.
   ``I want my left leg to heal, so that I would have at least one
leg, and I want to be able to walk normally like young women do. I
want to be able to do everything at home, to be a good housewife,''
said Alyona Berchuliak.
   Berchuliak, an attractive 19-year-old with dark hair, had bigger
plans. She was a graduate student working on a construction site and
planned a career as a construction site manager.
   But that was before she was trapped in the ruins of a nine-story
dormitory in Leninakan, Armenia's second-largest city.
   ``We finished our post-graduate practice and were gathering our
belongings to return home when the earthquake started,'' said
Berchuliak.
   ``We tried to run out, but the door was stuck, the lock was
broken.''
   Now confined to a wheelchair, Berchuliak lost her right leg.
Doctors diagnosed multiple fractures in her left leg, and she has
suffered from kidney complications.
   Unemployed, Berchuliak was recognized as an ``invalid of the
first group'' by the state, which entitled her to a monthly 75-ruble
pension, about $10 on the Soviet black market.
   ``I am sorry, but it's impossible to live on that,'' she said.
   Even so, Berchuliak is more fortunate than some. She was among 61
earthquake survivors, 49 of whom are amputees, who were flown to
Israel for medical treatment Tuesday on ``Mission Healing,'' which
is funded by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.
   Aryeh Cooperstock, an American who coordinated the project, said
many of the amputees are suffering the effects of inadequate,
hastily performed emergency surgery.
   ``They did the best they could under the circumstances,'' he
said. ``But in order to fit prosthetic limbs, other preparatory
surgery has to be done.''
   Israeli officials saw the mercy mission, in which a jetliner of
the national El Al airlines flew to Soviet Union for the first time,
as a further thaw in relations.
   ``This definitely shows we are experiencing a new relationship
with the Soviet Union,'' said Health Minister Yaakov Tzur, who met
the mercy flight at the airport Tuesday night.
   Moscow cut diplomatic relations with Israel after the 1967 Middle
East war in a show of solidarity with Arab nations. The Soviets are
also the major arms supplier for Israel's Arab enemies.
   Arieh Levin, head of the Israeli consular delegation in Moscow,
suggested there was a struggle in the Kremlin between pro-Arab
officials and those favoring closer ties with Israel.
   ``Our friends in the (Soviet) leadership are looking for signs of
good will from Israel in order to build on them toward an
amelioration of the Soviet policy towards Israel,'' Levin said.
   Narine Balayan, social welfare minister for the Republic of
Armenia, told reporters at a reception in Yerevan ``I hope the time
will come when planes like yours will land in Yerevan without any
disaster having prompted their visit.''
   About 40 other amputees from Armenia have been flown to Western
countries for treatment. Armenian officials said the Soviet Union
cannot produce prosthetic limbs of the same quality.
   The Soviet Union has plans to build factories to make articial
arms and legs with the help of West Germany and donations from
Lebanese Armenians. But the estimated 500 quake survivors with
missing limbs may wait for long to get prostheses without treatment
abroad.
   ``Some of the amputees have already received prostheses in the
United States. This group is now leaving for Israel, and another
group is to go abroad in autumn,'' said the republic's deputy social
welfare minister, Zaven Manuchian.
   ``We don't want the foreign aid to be a one-time action. We want
to be able to produce prostheses ourselves according to the world
standards,'' he said, speaking outside the red-brick airport
terminal as crippled survivors slowly struggled to the waiting the
Boeing 757.
   The survivors may eventually receive artificial limbs and find
their way back into society, but some of their wounds will never
heal.
   Like those of Egor Khatchaturian, 17, who lost 18 classmates when
his school collapsed in the city of Spitak. Khatchaturian, who lost
his left leg, burst into tears as he recalled the terrible moment of
their death.
   Sylvia Gevorkian, 51, kept adding the word ``killed'' to the list
of relatives when asked if she had lost family in the quake.
   ``Daughter killed,'' she said in a lifeless voice.
``Granddaughter killed...''

<HEAD>Pile of Rubble Could Be Sunken 17th-Century Galleon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Treasure hunters and archaeologists are
hoping a ship found off the Florida Keys in 1,500 feet of water will
turn out to be the remains of a treasure-laden, 17th-century Spanish
galleon.
   Seahawk Deep Ocean Technology of Tampa today planned to disclose
videotapes made by remote-controlled cameras of the shipwreck. The
ship could be the Nuestra Senora de la Merced, a Spanish galleon
believed to have vanished during a hurricane in 1622.
   ``It's worth a fortune in history,'' said Greg Stemm, a Tampa
businessman who hopes to recover the riches.
   Another galleon that sank in the same hurricane, the Nuestra
Senora de Atocha, was found laden with gold and silver by treasure
hunter Mel Fisher in 1985, about 50 miles north of Stemm's discovery.
   Jim Miller, Florida's state archaeologist who already viewed the
videos of the ship wreck, said the find's historical value is
significant because, although the ship's structure has collapsed,
its cargo, wood and organic materials have been well-preserved.
   ``This particular wreck is more like a time capsule. It sank and
it hasn't been touched since that time,'' Miller said.
   Last weekend, salvors aboard Stemm's 85-foot research vessel
Seahawk retrieved the ship's bell that will be used to strengthen
his company's federal admiralty claim to the wreck. Admiralty law
governs shipwrecks found in international waters _ in this case,
more than 12 miles from the U.S. coast.
   By summer's end, the salvors will begin a full-scale operation to
retrieve the fragile artifacts and confirm the ship's identity.
   So far, they have discovered a number of jars that could be
filled with wine, food and other commodities. The artifacts looked
to be piled in a mound about 100-by-30 feet, Miller said.
   If Stemm's research proves correct, the wreck he discovered could
hold a treasure worth millions.
   ``We're going to profit tremendously,'' said Stemm, 32, co-owner
of a deep-sea research company that discovered the sunken vessel in
April.

<HEAD>KGB Chief Says American Spy Committed Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy intelligence analyst who was really a
longtime Soviet spy committed suicide because of ``massive nervous
tension'' brought on by his workload, the head of the KGB was quoted
today as saying.
   The Guardian newspaper quoted Gen. Vladimir Kryuchkov as saying
Glenn Michael Souther, 32, was buried Monday in the same cemetery as
Kim Philby, the British traitor who spied for Moscow.
   The Soviet military newspaper Red Star published Souther's
obituary on Tuesday and, in a rare admission of Soviet spying, said
he was really KGB agent Mikhail Yevgenievich Orlov.
   ``It was a tragic thing. He committed suicide,'' Kryuchkov was
quoted as saying in an interview in Moscow on Tuesday. ``He was
buried yesterday (Monday). He leaves a Russian wife and daughter.''
   The newspaper quoted Kryuchkov as saying Souther's parents and
brother traveled to Moscow from the United States for the funeral.
   It quoted the KGB boss as describing Souther as ``a KGB major and
a very honest lad. He had felt bad for some time. He was under
massive nervous tension because he worked for a long time in very
difficult conditions.''
   Kryuchkov would not say how long Souther had worked for the KGB
before disappearing from the United States, the Guardian said.
   Red Star said Souther died suddenly on June 22 but did not give a
cause of death.
   Souther spent eight years in the U.S. Navy and Naval Reserve, and
his duties had included intelligence work.
   He disappeared in May 1986 and turned up on Soviet television
last July, saying he had defected because he was being harassed by
the FBI.
   He was apparently being investigated for espionage at the time of
his disappearance.

<HEAD>Allison Brings Torrential Rain, Tornadoes to Louisiana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The remnants of Tropical Storm Allison brought torrential rains
to Louisiana today after spawning tornadoes that damaged more than
100 homes.
   Thunderstorms also brought rain to much of the East and downed
trees and power lines from New York to Kentucky, and storms also
rocked the northern Plains and Rockies.
   Eight funnel clouds were reported within an hour around Monroe in
northern Louisiana Tuesday afternoon. No serious injuries were
reported, but one twister destroyed five houses and damaged about
100 others along a one-mile path.
   Heavy rains continued to fall across the state early today.
Street flooding was reported in Baton Rouge, where 4} inches of rain
fell in the six hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT, and in Lake Charles,
where more than 2{ inches fell.
   Rain was expected to continue in Louisiana through much of today
and a flash flood watch was in effect for most of the state and a
small portion of eastern Texas, where Allison dumped up to 14 inches
of rain in the 24 hours ended Tuesday morning and was blamed for one
traffic death and a drowning.
   A warm and humid air mass remained over much of the eastern half
of the nation this morning and thunderstorms were clustered over
portions of Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Delaware.
   Severe thunderstorms occurred late Tuesday in several parts of
the nation.
   Thunderstorm winds blew down trees and power lines in eastern New
York state and in northern New Jersey. A storm dumped an inch of
rain in an hour at Pittsburgh's airport, blew down trees and
disrupted power service to about 17,000 customers in southwest
Pennsylvania.
   There were reports of a tornado in the northwest Ohio town of
Wapakoneta ripping up trees and damaging some houses, but the
National Weather Service could not confirm them immediately.
   Thunderstorms also stretched from the northern Plains to the
Rockies. Golfball-size hail fell near Aberdeen, S.D., and hailstones
1{ inches in diameter fell just south of Cogswell, N.D.
   Storm winds gusted to 53 mph in Rexburg, Idaho, snapping a pine
tree 18 inches in diameter, and power lines were blown down north of
Riverton, Wyo.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
eastern Texas across the Gulf Coast and the Tennessee and Ohio
valleys to the East Coast. Storms were expected to be most numerous
from the lower Mississippi Valley across the Tennessee Valley and
central Appalachians to the north Atlantic Coast. Scattered showers
and thunderstorms were forecast for the northern Rockies and
northern Plains.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s and 70s along the Pacific
Coast, over the Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes, the northern and
central Appalachians and northern New England; over 100 degrees near
the Rio Grande Valley of southwest Texas and in the Desert
Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 42 degrees at Yellowstone,
Wyo., to 92 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is too busy
to meet an 11-year-old Californian who is flying around the world on
a ``friendship flight,'' a Soviet sponsor of the trip said today.
   But Tony Aliengena will still have the chance to pass along a
scroll with signatures of 250,000 American schoolchildren to a
Soviet official, said Valery Nikolayev, director of the Foundation
for Social Inventions.
   Nikolayev said in a telephone interview that Tony and his family
would meet with Valery Tzibukh, chairman of the Soviet parliament's
committee on youth, who would pass along the scroll to Gorbachev.
   Kremlin officials said ``this is just a bad time,'' Nikolayev
said, with Gorbachev involved in the formation of the new Soviet
government.
   Tony arrived in Moscow on Monday and has already visited Red
Square, where West German teen-ager Matthias Rust gained worldwide
fame _ and more than a year in Soviet prison _ by landing a
single-engined Cessna there in May 1987 after penetrated Soviet air
defenses.
   When his 47-day round-the-world trip is completed, Tony will
present a friendship scroll signed by Soviet youngsters to President
Bush, who has already agreed to meet him at journey's end.
   Tony, accompanied by his father, began the global flight in his
blue-and-white Cessna Centurion June 5 from California.
   His flight plan will take him 19,000 miles around the world in
short hops averaging three hours each.
   From Moscow, Tony is scheduled to fly on to the Volga River city
of Kuibyshev about 400 miles away, and eventually across the Bering
Strait to Alaska before heading home to San Juan Capistrano.

   A bomb exploded today in a garbage bin in the
central Israeli city of Ramle, slightly wounding four people, and
two Arabs were stabbed moments later in apparent revenge, police and
hospital officials said.
   The explosion occured at 11:15 a.m. on the main street of Ramle,
which was crowded with shoppers for the weekly open-air fruit and
vegetable market.
   Paramilitary border police were rushed to the city 12 miles east
of Tel Aviv to prevent further violence. The city has about 7,000
Arab residents among its 44,000 population.
   The four victims of the blast suffered minor injuries, according
to officials at Ramle Hospital.
   Two Arabs were stabbed in the legs at the market moments later by
Israelis angered by the blast, police sources said. They said two
Israelis were arrested for the stabbings.
   The Arabs victims were taken to Ramle Hospital but were not
believed to have been seriously hurt, the sources said, insisting on
anonymity.
   ``I heard a tremendous explosion. I saw a large cloud of smoke
and people running in all directions,'' Mordechai Levy, a shop owner
near the scene of the blast, said on Israel Army radio.
   He said many Palestinians from the occupied territories brought
produce to the market to sell on Wednesdays.
   Police cordoned off the area but had made no immediate arrests in
connection with the explosion.

   Student leader Wu'er Kaixi, in a videotape made
after fleeing China, has made a dramatic vow to continue the
struggle for democracy and predicted the ``wild beast'' Communist
leadership will soon fall.
   ``This kind of government doesn't have the strength to continue
living,'' Wu'er said in the 18-minute videotape shown today to The
Associated Press. ``They are the people's enemies.''
   Wu'er escaped from China with his girlfriend, Liu Yan, despite a
nationwide manhunt in which his picture was posted in airports and
train stations.
   He was easily the most charismatic of the 21 student leaders
accused by Communist authorities of inciting ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion.''
   Authorities ordered his arrest as part of the crackdown on
dissent in China that began June 3-4, when soldiers attacked unarmed
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, killing hundreds.
   Wu'er, at times choking back tears, made several emotional
references to the people killed during that battle, in which much of
the fighting raged along Changan Street that runs into Tiananmen
Square.
   ``I don't know how many martyrs' souls remain on Changan Street,
may they forever rest in peace.
   ``Those of us who remain alive, our lives no longer belong to
ourselves,'' he said. ``The lives of those classmates and countrymen
who sacrificed themselves for democracy, for freedom and for our
beautiful motherland have dissolved into our own.''
   He urged those who participated in the campaign for freedom to
``focus our will and continue the great patriotic democratic
movement until the end. ... If we don't get our act together, we
won't be able to get moving and China will never advance.''
   Wu'er, who looked pale in the videotape, wore a white T-shirt
with the name of his school, Beijing Normal University, on the
front. He said the statement was made about two weeks after the
Beijing bloodbath. He did not say where he was videotaped.
   During the statement, Wu'er attacked China's conservative leaders
_ Deng Xiaoping, Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun _ whom
he repeatedly referred to as ``fascists'' and at one point called
them a ``band of reactionary warlords.''
   He said the Chinese leaders will be judged by history. ``How can
I describe them? They are a small stumbling block on the road of
history.''
   He predicted the Chinese leaders would remain in power six months
to three years. ``It won't be longer. This government will
definitely fall.''
   Wu'er gave an account of his own ordeal, describing how he left
Tiananmen Square the night of the military sweep, spitting up blood
from an apparent ulcer.
   He shared an ambulance with a dying classmate whose ``stomach was
still gurgling blood'' from bullet wounds and a soldier shot by his
own troops, apparently by mistake.
   The student leader claimed ``many people'' were killed in
Tiananmen, denying the government's contention that nobody died in
the square.
   ``A lot of my classmates were crushed to death by tanks. They
were completely flattened by tanks on Tiananmen Square,'' Wu'er said.
   ``There were innumerable tribulations and a narrow escape from
death, but I'm still alive,'' he said.
   He acknowledged that he and other pro-democracy protesters were
naive to think the Communist government would tolerate their
peaceful demonstrations.
   ``But we never thought ... the shamelessness and viciousness of
those wild beasts would go to such an extent,'' he said.
   Wu'er remains in hiding in the West.
   The videotape is the second of his statements released by
activists in an underground network that has helped more than a
dozen participants in the pro-democracy movement escape the Chinese
crackdown.
   ``A black sun has appeared in the sky of my motherland and
republic,'' Wu'er said in a handwritten letter dated June 15 and
shown to The AP this week.
   ``But our life is young, stubborn and uncrushable. ... Black sun,
I'm going to shoot you down!''

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 16-17 bgng `Compound Q...' with two grafs to CORRECT
background to show that Compound Q is trichosanthin and GLQ-223 a derivative.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is
investigating an unauthorized clinical trial of an experimental AIDS
drug from China in which one patient died.
   Organizers of the study involving Compound Q, a purified extract
of a protein from the root tubers of Chinese cucumbers, defended
their actions under the FDA's so-called compassionate use policy for
experimental drugs.
   ``It would be foolish not to give the benefits of research coming
out of an individual's use of this drug; ethically, morally and
legally it is the correct and proper thing to do,'' said Curtis
Ponzi, an attorney for San Francisco-based Project Inform, a
non-profit group that helped set up the trial.
   The FDA, under its so-called compassionate use decision, allows
individuals to import ``personal use'' quantities of experimental
drugs. Large-scale importation of unapproved products for commercial
use is prohibited.
   Dr. Alan Levin, a San Francisco immunologist who helped set up
the study, said the program is at least six months ahead of mainline
research on the drug's efficacy and contended he could have dosage
recommendations within three months.
   ``What we're doing is legally compassionate, and not at all in
violation of any laws,'' said Levin.
   Of the 42 patients from California, New York and Florida, three
showed adverse reactions and one died Saturday, possibly from side
effects induced by the drug, Levin said. The patient was in the
advanced stages of AIDS.
   Levin said another 33 patients had received the drug but were not
part of the study. However, Levin issued a public plea to AIDS
patients asking them not to inject themselves with the drug without
medical supervision. Several people have been injured after
obtaining bootlegged supplies of the potent drug.
   In a statement issued late Tuesday, FDA spokesman Brad Stone said
the agency would investigate the underground trial because ``the
exact circumstances surrounding the death and other adverse
reactions reported to have occurred in this trial have not been
ascertained.''
   It said questions also have been raised about the composition of
the drug in the Project Inform trial and whether it was illegally
imported.
   Violating FDA policy on distributing unapproved drugs could
result in seizure of the material; cease and desist orders; or, in
rare cases, mostly involving for-profit schemes, criminal penalties.
   Fred Ponder, who is helping Project Inform organize the trial,
said the equivalent of 225 doses were brought into the country from
Shanghai by a Los Angeles nurse, who had to bribe officials in
another country to get it out.
   The patients under monitoring by nine physicians all showed
clinical improvement, with reductions averaging 50 percent of the
P-24 antigen, a key indicator of viral activity caued by AIDS
infection, said Levin. He added the drug produced its best effects
in those least ill from the disease.
   ``Our scientific (procedures) are very good and rigorous,'' said
Levin. He and his wife, Dr. Vera Byers, designed the trial.
   ``I resent people calling us underground, illegal or guerrilla
groups,'' said Levin. ``We're not amateurs. We're first-class
doctors.''
   Compound Q is trichosanthin, a protein derived from Chinese
cucumber root tubers. It has been used for centuries in China to
induce abortions and more recently to treat some forms of skin
cancer. It can produce severe side effects because it acts as a
temporary immune supressor, said Levin.
   A highly purified form of trichosanthin called GLQ-223 was
approved by the FDA in April for human testing. In two years of
test-tube and animal studies, it appeared to selectively kill key
cells called macrophages that are believed to harbor the AIDS virus.
   According to figures from the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta, 97,193 Americans have contracted AIDS since June 1981
through May 1989. Of those, 55,673 have died.

   Two holdup men had it all
backwards. While most robbers take money, this pair left some behind.
   Authorities said men entered a grocery store early Tuesday and
picked up a case of soda and a gallon of milk. Clerk Marlon John
Russman rang up the merchandise, which totaled a little more than $7.
   One man handed Russman $10, then pulled a gun, demanding the
money in the cash register. Russman refused and slammed the drawer
shut. The robbers fired and fled, and the clerk was slightly wounded
in the head and ear.
   Later, Russman told police he wasn't afraid because he knew the
weapon was a pellet gun.
   Russman said the robbers left their $10 behind. He kept it.

   The new Soviet legislature today confirmed its
first Cabinet members after rejecting, for the first time in Soviet
history, a slate of nominees for the government positions.
   One of the three confirmed today was approved only after
promising more radical changes than he had earlier espoused.
   Under questioning from the 542-member Supreme Soviet, Yuri
Maslyukov, chairman of the government planning agency Gosplan, said
his agency would drastically reduce central planning of the economy.
He was then confirmed as both the new Gosplan chairman and first
deputy premier.
   Lev Voronin, 61, a bureaucrat in the state supply committee, was
confirmed as a first deputy premier in charge of general matters.
   Economist Leonid Abalkin was confirmed as a deputy premier and
head of the new economic reform commission.
   On Tuesday, Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov withdrew seven of his Cabinet
nominees after the newly elected legislature refused to support them
_ a first in Soviet history.
   Six of the nominees were rejected in first-ever confirmation
hearings last week by committees of the Supreme Soviet, which this
year replaced the old rubber-stamp legislature. The previous
legislature did not have the power to confirm or reject top
government officials.
   Ryzhkov also withdrew his nominee, who was not identified, to
head the Ministry of Instrument-Making, Automation Equipment and
Control Systems, and said he had no nominee to lead the government
environmental agency.
   Deputy Igor Griazin of Estonia said he had expected more
controversy over the 52-year-old Maslyukov, but the Gosplan chief
promised his agency would confine itself to setting major economic
factors such as the federal budget, raw materials and military
production, leaving details to the republics.
   ``Two months ago, he was opposed to all this,'' Griazin said.
``This is a new guy. I like him very much.''
   There were only six votes against Maslyukov. The hands raised to
vote `yes' were not counted as they were a clear majority.
   Abalkin took the podium after his confirmation and said Soviet
efficiency must be improved.
   ``We have a budget deficit of 100 billion rubles ($156 billion)
this year,'' he said. ``There are two ways to eliminate it. Cut
expenditures or increase revenues.''
   Abalkin explained the poor Soviet standard of living with the
comment: ``We live no worse than we work.''
   Deputies laughed and then applauded.
   The Supreme Soviet is the country's first full-time
representative legislature, a branch of the larger Congress of
People's Deputies chosen this spring in the first nationwide
contested elections in seven decades.
   The six nominees rejected Tuesday after committee hearings were
Culture Minister Vasily G. Zakharov; Gennady P. Bogomyakov, nominee
for minister of the oil and gas industry; Polad A. Polad-Zade for
minister of land reclamation and water management, a controversial
department in charge of dams and canals; Marat V. Gramov for head of
the sports committee; Lira I. Rozenova for the price committee, and
Vladimir G. Gribov for head of the central bank.
   Ryzhkov said candidates for a first deputy premiership and head
of a new Commission on Food and Purchases were withdrawn during
other committee work.
   The legislative agenda for this 40-day summer session includes
new laws on consumer protection, inventions, the court system, the
press, taxes, citizen associations, the criminal code and economic
reform, and first readings of new laws on trade unions, youth,
freedom of conscience and religious organizations.

   Burma's military government today
arrested a top official of the main opposition party as part of an
intensified crackdown on dissent, a party spokeswoman said.
   Authorities seized Aung Lwin, a member of the nine-man executive
committee of the National League for Democracy, said spokeswoman Ma
Theingi. She was reached by telephone in Burma's capital of Rangoon.
   She said authorities on Tuesday had arrested three student
leaders including Nyo Htun and Zaw Zaw Aung of the All Burma
Federation of Student Unions. The federation was formed during last
year's popular uprising against authoritarian rule.
   Also arrested that day, she said, were a member of the People's
Progressive Party and a member of another political party, the
National Democratic Front.
   Ma Theingi said more than 2,000 members of the National League
for Democracy have been arrested since September, when army chief
Gen. Saw Maung took power and crushed street protests by shooting
and jailing demonstrators.
   Aung San Suu Kyi, general secretary of the League and the leading
opposition figure, said today the authorities ``are trying to
tighten things up but it has been coming for a long time.''
   ``They don't want us to have democracy,'' she said when reached
by telephone in Rangoon. ``For the last few months they have been
suppresssing the democratic movement more and more.''
   A government spokesman told a news conference Friday that 195
people have been detained since March 13, when a new round of
scattered anti-government protests began.
   Last year, tens of thousands of people took to the streets
demanding an end to a quarter of a century of one-party rule.
Thousands were reportedly killed by security forces before and
immediately after Gen. Saw Maung reestablished control.
   The government has allowed formation of alternative political
parties and promised to hold a general election next year. But
diplomats say authorities increasingly are concerned about the
popularity of Aung San Suu Kyi and her party.
   Aung San Suu Kyi said today that the official media for the first
time last Friday mentioned her and her party by name in attacking
the opposition.
   She said authorities on Tuesday published a special newspaper
supplement just to repeat the condemnations of the previous day.
   Diplomats predict the confrontation may climax next month, when
anti-government rallies are expected during anniversaries of the
turmoil a year ago.

   President Bush is weighing proposals to curb
special-interest influence in political campaigns, end
gerrymandering and keep track of efforts by members of Congress to
influence executive branch policy, administration officials said
today.
   In addition, Bush will propose pay raises for judges, top
executive branch officials and members of Congress, said one source
who spoke on condition of anonymity. His proposal did not include a
specific figure as of today, the source said.
   Proposals Bush is to announce Thursday, the official said, would:
   _ Abolish special-interest political action committees that pour
millions of dollars into the campaign war chests of federal
candidates.
   _ End the gerrymandering practice of drawing political district
lines to benefit one party. Republicans have tended to fare badly,
with many state legislatures which draw up the districts controlled
by Democrats.
   _ Call for a pay raise ``across the branches'' of government.
Congress quashed a 51 percent pay raise in February in the face of
public outrage.
   In addition, the president is considering a proposal to log calls
from members of Congress trying to sway officials' decisions, said
the source.
   As part of his campaign reform proposals, Bush is considering new
restrictions on so-called ``soft money'', a term generally referring
to croporate and union money which, although barred from federal
campaign, finds its way into campaign funds through loopholes.
   One top-level official said Bush is looking at more complete
disclosure of such funds. That could entail opening the books of the
national Republican and Democratic parties, which are among the
primary recipients of such contributions.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported in today's editions that
Bush also would emphasize enforcement of the Voting Rights Act in
his speech to congressional interns at the Library of Congress.
   Among the items on which Bush is making decisions, the official
said, are:
   _Barring members of Congress from carrying excess campaign funds
over from one election to the next. Members who win their races
handily sometimes amass huge war chests by rolling over the funds
from election to election.
   _Limiting the amount congressional incumbents can spend on
mailings with their ``franking'' privileges. Critics say these
mailings to constituents give the incumbents unfair advantage over
election challengers at taxpayer expense.
   _Banning corporate or labor union PACs, while allowing those that
are not connected to such groups _ so-called ideological PACs that
are centered on a political philosophy.
   The president also is considering lowering the current $5,000 per
candidate limit for PAC contributions to $1,000, the official said.
   Current law allows individuals to contribute up to $1,000 per
candidate in each election, while PACs may give $5,000.
   Bush previously said he wanted to do away with PACS, which in the
1988 election gave $151.3 million to House and Senate candidates,
according to Federal Election Commission records. Bush's own
presidential campaign got $862,950 in PAC money.
   But he did not previously discuss separating out the ideological
PACs. Bush aides said these are considered more acceptable because
they do not represent a specific financial interest.
   However, the banned category would include leadership PACs formed
by many politicians, including Bush when he was vice president, to
raise campaign funds and give them to other candidates.
   Such PACs, however, are seen as having a far more beneficial role
for potential presidential candidates, who use them to fund their
travel and coalition-building during the months before they announce
their candidacies.
   Bush on Tuesday reiterated his opposition to public financing of
congressional campaigns.
   Currently, the presidential primary campaigns operate with
federal funds on a matching basis, while the general election
presidential campaigns are entirely federally funded. The money
comes from a voluntary $1 checkoff on individual income tax forms.
   The PAC Bush founded before he became a presidential candidate,
called Fund For America's Future, was the second largest of about
4,000 PACs that filed records with the Federal Election Comission in
1985-86.
   The Bush PAC raised $9.4 million in the years when it was most
active, the 1985-86 campaign cycle, second only to the conservative
Congressional Club founded by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. The
Congressional Club and its affiliated groups raised $16.6 million.
   By contrast the largest corporate PAC was the AT&amp;T PAC which
raised $1.8 million, FEC records show.
   Of labor-related PACs, the Teamsters had the largest, raising
$4.4 million that cycle. Among the trade association-related PACs,
the Realtors' PAC raised $5.7 million and the American Medical
Association PAC raised just under $5 million.
   In the 1987-88 election cycle, Bush's PAC raised just under $2
million as his presidential campaign geared up.

<HEAD>House OKs Bill That Could Mean Freedom for Jailed Mother</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House overwhelmingly passed a bill today
that could lead to freedom for a mother who has been jailed for 22
months in a bitter child custody battle.
   The House, on a 376-34 vote, approved legislation that sets a
12-month limit for civil contempt jailings in the District of
Columbia.
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., the bill sponsor, said the legislation
would be applied retroactively to Dr. Elizabeth Morgan.
   Morgan has been incarcerated since August 1987 for failing to
produce her daughter, Hilary, for court-ordered visits with Dr. Eric
Foretich, Morgan's ex-husband and the girl's father.
   Morgan hid Hilary after alleging that Foretich sexually abused
the child, charges Foretich has repeatedly denied. Hilary's
whereabouts are unknown.
   The bill breezed through the House despite protests that it
unfairly interferes with a court case and sets a dangerous precedent
for future child custody disputes.
   ``If this is such a good idea, we should have done it for all 50
states,'' Rep. Herbert Bateman, R-Va., said during floor debate
Tuesday.
   But Wolf said Congress doesn't ``have the authority to do it for
all the states.''
   Congress has review power over all District of Columbia laws, but
rarely uses its right to intervene in city government or the court
system.
   Morgan's case is before the city's appeals court, which is
reviewing D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon's May 11 decision
to keep her behind bars.
   ``Don't apply it just to Dr. Morgan's case _ apply it to others
and see if it fits,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. ``I have no
doubt that this case is based on conscience, but tomorrow's case may
be malice.''
   Wolf and others argued that Morgan has demonstrated her resolve
by remaining in jail and, in any event, deserves the right to a jury
trial.
   Under terms of the bill, the U.S. Attorney for the District of
Columbia would be required to file criminal contempt of court
charges before a person has been jailed for 12 months, or set the
person free.
   Stephen Sachs, Morgan's attorney, has repeatedly pleaded for
Dixon to file criminal contempt charges against Morgan so she can
receive a jury trial.
   ``This bill hurts Hilary, because it provides no guarantee she
will be returned,'' said Elaine Mittleman, Foretich's lawyer. ``Dr.
Foretich's rights as a father are being absolutely violated.''
   Before Morgan can be freed, a bill sponsored by Utah Republican
Orrin Hatch must pass the Senate.
   Wolf's bill is modeled on similar legislation in Wisconsin and
California.

<HEAD>Who Performs `Tommy' Benefit in New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY RYCKMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meet the new Who, a little older, grayer and
quieter, but still able to deliver the goods with a punch.
   Before a packed house Tuesday night at Radio City Music Hall, the
Who played virtually its entire 1969 ``Tommy'' rock opera in a
benefit for autistic and abused children.
   It was a different Who, however, with a muted Pete Townshend
mostly playing acoustic guitar because of severe hearing problems
from years of playing loud electric guitar. He had help on lead
guitar from Steve Bolton, who added a 1980s flavor to the band's
'60s standards.
   John Entwistle's superb bass at times seemed to overpower the
other band members, but there was added support from a five-member
horn section, three backup singers, drummer Simon Phillips and
percussionist Jodi Linscott. Roger Daltrey and Towshend were both in
fine voice.
   The Who raced through an hour-long, uninterrupted ``Tommy,''
bringing the audience to its feet with ``Pinball Wizard,'' ``I'm
Free'' and ``We're Not Gonna Take It.''
   Townshend, who wrote ``Tommy,'' went through as many guitars as
he did in the old days, but this time they all went off stage in one
piece. One of Daltrey's two tamborines was the only casualty.
   The rock opera, with its muddled story line about a deaf, dumb
and blind kid who's cured and becomes a rock celebrity, was first
performed in London in 1969. It was made into a movie by Ken Russell
in 1975, starring Daltrey, Ann-Margret, Oliver Reed, Eric Clapton,
Keith Moon and Elton John as the Pinball Wizard. The Royal Canadian
Ballet did its own version and the London Symphony Orchestra did a
recording.
   ``Tommy'' has a rather mystical quality with its songs about
pinball, mobs and spiritualism.
   Townshend once joked about ``Tommy,'' saying rock critics and
many fans took it seriously but that it was really just light
entertainment.
   After performing ``Tommy,'' the band returned for an encore,
which also lasted an hour. Townshend picked up an electric guitar
for ``Can't Explain.'' And the Who had the audience on its feet
again, clapping and singing along to such Who classics as ``Behind
Blue Eyes,'' ``Love, Rein O'er Me'' and a sizzling ``Won't Get
Fooled Again.''
   The Who plans one other performance of ``Tommy,'' in Los Angeles
on Aug. 24.

<HEAD>Attorney General Opposes Identity Cards for Gun Owners</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 6 grafs with Thornburgh reaction, picks up 4nd graf pvs,
The 40-page</HEAD>

   A Justice Department task force is floating the
idea of requiring weapons purchasers to obtain a national gun
owner's identity card, but Attorney General Dick Thornburgh won't
endorse it, a spokesman said today.
   David Runkel, commenting on a proposal contained in a lengthy
list of gun-control options published this week, said Thornburgh
``is opposed to that and would not recommend it to the president.''
   ``He feels that's an infringement on rights of Americans and
believes that is not the way to tackle this problem,'' the spokesman
said.
   Thornburgh opposed a similar plan that was advanced in the 1970s
when he was assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's criminal division, Runkel said.
   The card plan has been strongly opposed by organizations of gun
owners.
   The task force study was required by Congress last year as part
of anti-drug legislation. Congress, noting that illegal weapons play
an increasing role in the epidemic of illegal drugs, ordered a
review of ways to try to keep felons from buying guns.
   The 40-page study, published Monday in the Federal Register,
outlined a variety of possibilities grouped along two general
approaches.
   One method would be aimed at potential gun buyers and would
require them to show certification that they have no criminal record.
   The second involves the country's 270,000 gun dealers and would
require them to check with local and federal police agencies to
quickly search computerized records before making any of the 7.5
million annual weapons deals.
   The identity card has long been opposed by the National Rifle
Association, along with civil liberties groups.
   The task force noted that opposition. ``We are keenly aware of
the significant concerns about protecting the privacy interests of
all citizens,'' the panel said.
   It did not recommend whether any of the options should actually
be implemented. Nor did it spell out which firearms would be
involved.
   President Bush, a lifelong member of the NRA, has proposed a
permanent ban on the importation of semiautomatic assault-style
rifles.
   The Firearm Owner's Identification Card could be applied for long
before a person intended to purchase a gun. It would be
electronically encoded with information about an individual's
background and the card could be decoded by machines that would be
available to gun dealers.
   Currently, there is no requirement at the federal level for any
check of the eligibility of a gun purchaser. But 29 states and the
District of Columbia require that a pre-purchase check be made of an
individual's criminal history.
   The study also lists a variety of other options, including
centralized record keeping to replace the current hodge-podge of
widely scattered files; live electronic scans of buyers'
fingerprints by gun dealers at the time of purchase; and telephone
checks of police records. Costs of the programs range up to $10
billion, the panel noted.
   The panel didn't attempt to figure out ways to identify other
persons, aside from convicted felons, who try to buy guns. That task
should be done by a private contractor and such a study is now in
the planning stages, the task force said.
   The study was ordered by Congress last fall, shortly before it
adjourned for the year, as the chamber wrote a package of anti-drug
legislation.
   One proposal proposed as part of the bill called for a seven-day
waiting period before a handgun could be purchased. Opponents said a
study should be done before any waiting period was imposed and the
plan published Monday was designed to meet that requirement.

<HEAD>China Recalls All Ambassadors in Postscript to Crackdown</HEAD>

   China has recalled all of its foreign ambassadors,
but officials refused to confirm the move was linked to the fallout
from the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Western leaders kept up their criticism of the suppression of
dissent, which left hundreds dead.
   In an emotional videotape seen today, one of the student leaders
of the pro-democracy movement vowed from hiding to continue the
fight and predicted the ``wild beast,'' China's communist
leadership, soon will fall.
   A cultural attache at China's embassy in Kenya confirmed that all
envoys would be called back to Beijing for a general meeting. He
denied the recall was connected to the crackdown, which began June
3-4.
   But in Washington, a spokeswoman at the Chinese Embassy said
Ambassador Han Xu will remain in Washington. She declined comment
when asked why Han was not returning to Beijing.
   Embassies in West Germany, Italy, Yugoslavia, the Philippines,
Australia, Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Poland and Belgium were among those
that said their ambassadors had left or would return to Beijing soon.
   The most common reason given for the return of the ambassadors
was ``for scheduled vacation'' or ``annual home leave.''
   The Foreign Ministry in Beijing had no immediate comment on the
reports.
   In Tokyo, Ambassador Yang Zhenya told Education Minister Takeo
Nishioka that he was going home as part of a general recall, Japan's
Kyodo News Service reported.
   A Western diplomat in Beijing said the ambassadors' meeting would
take place July 7.
   ``We assume they're going to give them the government line, and
tell them to go out and sell it. And stop your people from
defecting,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A week ago, China urged the more than 20 Chinese diplomats who
had defected to return home, saying they were led astray by
misinformation.
   Britain said Tuesday that three first secretaries at the Chinese
Embassy in London had asked for political asylum.
   The Western diplomat noted that China recalled all its
ambassadors during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when the nation
cut almost all contacts with the outside world.
   China's 1.1 billion people were told today to rally behind a June
9 speech by senior leader Deng Xiaoping, in which he praised the
military for crushing the pro-democracy movement.
   Deng contends the student-led movement for democratic reforms
turned into a counterrevolutionary rebellion and said in the speech
that China must never waver in its opposition to ``bourgeois
liberalization,'' or Western ideas.
   Deng said China must not back away from economic reforms but said
ideological education is needed to show people that such reforms can
only succeed under the guidance of the Communist Party.
   All major dailies carried Deng's speech in full on their front
pages. The noon news devoted 15 minutes to reading the entire text.
   Deng, 84, reportedly ordered the military assault on Beijing, and
his speech has become the gospel for hard-liners seeking to root out
all dissent in the party and government.
   China has been sharply criticized by many nations for using
troops to drive pro-democracy protesters out of central Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in an assault that left scores of people dead.
   Official Chinese reports say nearly 300 people died, including
nearly 100 soldiers and police. Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence sources say the death toll may have been as high as
3,000.
   At least 1,800 protesters and activists have been arrested, and
27 people have been executed for alleged roles in anti-government
protests that broke out in response to the crackdown.
   One of those who escaped arrest is Wu'er Kaixi, a student protest
leader who fled China after he was accused of inciting
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' and ordered arrested.
   ``This kind of government doesn't have the strength to continue
living,'' Wu'er said in an 18-minute videotape shown today to The
Associated Press.
   ``Those of us who remain alive, our lives no longer belong to
ourselves,'' he said, at times choking back tears.
   He urged those who participated in the campaign to ``focus our
will and continue the great patriotic democratic movement until the
end. ... If we don't get our act together, we won't be able to get
moving and China will never advance.''
   He said the statement was made about two weeks after the military
crackdown in Tiananmen. He did not say where it was videotaped.
   Since the crackdown, the United States has cut off arms sales and
canceled all high-level visits to China.
   The European Economic Community on Tuesday urged similar steps by
its 12 members and joined Washington in recommending that the World
Bank postpone new loans to Beijing.
   Japan, China's most important source of development aid, has
suspended talks on new loans.
   China has criticized the United States for interfering in its
internal affairs,but has generally tried to shrug off its growing
diplomatic isolation by saying it hopes foreign contacts and trade
will quickly return to normal.
   China's legislature, the National People's Congress, is to
convene a special meeting Thursday to endorse the party line and act
on a draft bill that will tighten regulations on the holding of
rallies and demonstrations.

   An infant girl probably saved the
lives of 18 fellow Indonesians after their boat capsized in a storm,
the Bernama news agency reported Wednesday.
   One of the Indonesians clinging to the boat held up the
1-year-old to attract the attention of the crew of the merchant
vessel Trans Sun in the Straits of Malacca, about 210 miles
northwest of Kuala Lumpur, Bernama said.
   The ship's captain, E.M.R. Fonseca, said his crew at first
believed the boat was a log, but looking back through binoculars, he
saw the baby and ordered the ship to turn back. The Indonesians were
rescued after being adrift nearly 10 hours.
   Their skipper, Abdul Rahman Baki, said the group of 19
Indonesians, including the girl, had left Sunday from Pulau Rapat
for Sungai Pak Ning, in another part of Indonesian Sumatra.
   Their 30-foot boat capsized and sprang a leak, but all managed to
cling to it, he added.
   After much frantic shouting and waving as the Trans Sun passed,
Abdul Rahman said he held up the girl, Erna Yusup, to attract the
crew's attention.
   Heirianto Wongso, immigration officer at the Indonesian Consulate
in Penang, said the 19 would be sent back to Sumatra in two days.

   Japan plans to develop an unmanned space plane in
the next decade and aims eventually to send its own astronauts into
space, the Science and Technology Agency said Wednesday.
   The 10-year plan, adopted Wednesday by the Space Development
Commission, also calls for basic research on robots capable of
assembling and repairing satellites and for developing the H-2
rocket, with a two-ton capacity.
   A timetable for the projects will depend on the availability of
money, said Masafumi Maekawa of the agency's Space Activities
Planning Division.
   Japan, a late entry in the aerospace field because of
prohibitions imposed by the United States at the end of World War
II, is spending $1.1 billion on various space programs in fiscal
1989, which started in April. Maekawa said NASA spent $9 billion in
1988.
   After 19 launches, Japan has a 100 percent success rate with its
N and H series rockets, but none can lift more than 1,200 pounds. It
has yet to test a two-stage liquid combustion engine to be used in
the H-2 rocket.

   The case of a U.S. soldier
sentenced to 30 years in prison for giving military secrets to East
Germany will be reviewed by a general who may reduce the sentence,
an Army spokesman said Wednesday.
   Michael A. Peri of Laguna Niguel, Calif., pleaded guilty to
espionage last week during his court-martial in Fulda, where he was
based with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment near the East German
border.
   Before he was sentenced Saturday, the 22-year-old intelligence
analyst tearfully begged forgiveness for leaving his unit in
February and turning over defense plans to the East Germans. He
denied receiving any money for the plans.
   Under a pre-trial agreement, Peri's 30-year sentence will be
reduced to 25 years if he serves the first three with good behavior.
   Peri also received a dishonorable discharge, lost his pay and
benefits and was demoted from specialist four to the Army's lowest
rank, private 1.
   The case must be reviewed by Lt. Gen. John W. Woodmansee, the
commander of the U.S. Army's 5th Corps in Frankfurt, said corps
spokesman Maj. Samuel Taylor.
   ``Gen. Woodmansee, as the convening authority for the case,
automatically reviews it and if he finds grounds to do so, can
choose to reduce the sentence,'' Taylor said.
   The case then is sent to the U.S. Court of Military Review in
Falls Church, Va., for review.
   ``Even if Woodmansee chooses to reduce the sentence, the review
court can further reduce it. They can never increase it, so all of
this is in Peri's favor,'' Taylor said.
   Peri can ask that the case be reviewed again by a panel of three
civilian judges at the Court of Military Appeals in Washington and,
as a last resort, he can petition the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Peri left the 11th Regiment on Feb. 20 and went to East Germany
with a portable Army computer and discs containing classified
material.
   He returned voluntarily March 4. The regiment is responsible for
front-line defense if Soviet bloc forces attack.
   Peri said he left because he was frustrated with his job as an
intelligence analyst and electronic signal intercepter.
   Military officials described him as a model soldier before his
disappearance.
   Peri is being held at an Army jail in Mannheim pending transfer
to the military's disciplinary barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.

   On the Supreme Court's decision on burning the flag:
   
   June 22
   The Lufkin (Texas) Daily News:
   What could be as repugnant as burning an American flag?
   A few things come close: A cross burning in a front yard,
anti-Semitic statements scrawled across the side of a wall, the
humiliating harangue of an ethnic slur.
   All of these things are allowed and protected as free speech
under the constitution of the United States.
   The fact is that liberty, true liberty, allows stupid and
outrageous political beliefs. It allows them even if no one else
agrees. It allows them even though they violate the bounds of human
decency.
   Burning the flag is all of that and more. It tramples on the
sacrifices made by our fathers, sons and brothers in protecting this
nation. It brands those who do it with a mark of ignorance none of
us should ignore. We may have to allow them to speak their piece,
but nothing commands us to listen.
   But, ironically, the Supreme Court decision saying flag-burning
is legal takes something away from those who would do it. Let them
take to the streets of Moscow, Havana or Beijing, burn the flags of
those nations and they will not find the same freedom of expression.
   As painful as it is, the Supreme Court decision shows again why
America is different. As long as that difference remains, the flag
stands for something that can never be burned.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   June 24
   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine:
   The outcry against the Supreme Court flag-burning decision may be
shortlived. We are not dealing with an issue which involves enormous
social and legal dilemmas, such as abortion.
   The concerns are symbolic, going to the intent of how a flag is
burned. Burning, after all, is the recommended method for disposal
of worn flags, so the physical act is irrelevant to the court's
decision.
   What is involved is what are we to do when an isolated protester
burns the flag, as an affront to the vast majority of Americans who
consider themselves patriotic, and to the flag as a symbol of
national unity and resolve.
   Do we punish the protester, and possibly send him to jail? Or do
we tolerate even an act we hate, as a measure of our commitment to
unfettered political speech?

   The Joplin (Mo.) Globe:
   The Supreme Court siphoned off much of the symbolism from the
American flag, to which symbolism is everything. A majority of five
justices reasoned _ if you can call it that _ that the First
Amendment protects protesters who burn the flag in political
demonstrations. In addition to sparking outrage from millions of
Americans, the court invalidated flag-desecration laws in 48 states.
...
   Of course the flag, the visible symbol embodying the nation, is
worthy of sensible care. Protected political speech is vital but not
invulnerable. To perceive obscene treatment of the flag as a command
of the Constitution is an obscenity in itself.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   June 24
   The News Dispatch, Michigan City, Ind.:
   ... Burning the flag may be a distasteful form of expression, and
it may be extremely wrong-headed. But you can't protect the most
reasoned and inspired free speech without at the same time
protecting the speech of those who are wrong and perhaps even
outrageous.
   And burning or desecrating the flag does nothing to harm what the
flag symbolizes. ... There is delicious irony in the fact that a
flag-burner who thinks he is trashing the country and its system
actually illustrates the remarkable amount of freedom we enjoy. ...
   The flag, bless it _ and what it stands for _ can take a little
free speech and come back for more.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   June 23
   The Journal, New Ulm, Minn.:
   ... The justices are right. The flag is a symbol of our country
and the freedoms we enjoy. One of those freedoms is freedom of
expression. The symbol should not be more important than the freedom
itself.
   In a way, the flag may never look as noble as it does when it is
going up in flames in the hands of protestors. The flag is being
given up as a sacrifice for the right of the protestors to make
their point as they see fit. In burning a flag, a protestor gives
the flag a dignity and nobility he himself will never have.
   Let them burn the flag. They will not be able to burn out the
ideas and freedoms the flag represents. The flag will wave in our
hearts long after the protest is forgotten.

   The Newport (R.I.) Daily News on the Customs Service:
   The federal government is at it again, proving that it can turn a
silk purse into a sow's ear.
   This time it is the Customs Service that earns our ire. It seems
that despite netting more than $1 billion in property seizures in
1988, Customs managed to rack up millions in red ink. ...
   The Customs debacle is an outrage. Taxpayers are getting squeezed
more each year in user fees, Social Security taxes, higher health
costs, etc. We have little choice but to accept these fees. But we
need not accept ineptitude and incompetence on the part of the
federal government.

   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on coal strike violence:
   United Mine Workers members who struck the Pittston Coal Group
companies justly felt desperation. Their employer seems intent on
breaking the union and has resorted to cutting off pensions and
medical benefits, while running a media campaign that makes the firm
sound benevolent. ...
   At first, the strikers acted in the non-violent tradition of
Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. They blocked coal-hauling
roads with their bodies, inviting arrest in the classic style of
civil disobedience.
   But when other miners began a wildcat strike against other
unionized mines _ ignoring the no-strike contract they had entered,
and idling a third of the nation's coal production _ they turned
increasingly to violence that damages their cause, demoralizes their
sympathizers and, in West Virginia's case, undermines their state.
...
   The union plays into the companies' hands by lawless conduct.
Members speed the decline of their union by their actions. If (union
President) Richard Trumka or other UMW officials can end the
violence they should do so.
   But no matter what anyone else should do, the state of West
Virginia should enforce the law. When mobs roam the land, no one is
safe.

   The Houston Post on private club membership:
   It is Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's business if he wants to rejoin three
exclusive clubs from which he resigned after becoming the 1988
Democratic vice presidential nominee. But he might explain why he
felt the memberships were inappropriate for a candidate seeking high
national office, while they are all right for a United States
senator.
   Bentsen's spokesman, Jack DeVore, says the three clubs _ the
River Oaks Country Club and Ramada Club of Houston, and the
Middleburg Tennis Club in Virginia _ have no membership
restrictions. But the River Oaks and Middleburg clubs have no black
members. The Ramada Club membership has been described as ``mixed.''
   The senator was a member of the Houston clubs for 25 years before
resigning last August when he became Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis' running mate. At the time, DeVore said Bentsen felt it was
``the appropriate thing to do.'' Now he says associates have told
the senator it is ``appropriate for him to rejoin.''
   The only conclusion we can draw from this is that Bentsen didn't
want the memberships to become a presidential campaign issue, but no
longer considers them a political liability. How about basing it on
what is right?

   Evening Express, Portland, Maine, on disposable diapers:
   Nearly nine out of every 10 babies born in the United States
spend their first few years swaddled in plastic diapers. One by one
they add up: to 16 billion each year. ...
   Despite their name, the diapers are far from ``disposable.''
After a single wearing, most end up in municipal landfills where
they provide a potential breeding ground for viruses and bacteria
that cause polio, hepatitis, meningitis and other diseases.
   New ways of dealing with the diapers must be found. One suggested
approach is to make the plastic liners in the diapers with
biodegradable corn starch which, supporters say, causes them to
disintegrate 100 times faster.

   Saginaw (Mich.) News on the savings and loan crisis:
   Having preserved some semblance of reason in the national
insanity that is the savings and loan scandal, Congress should next
seek to bring the crooks to justice.
   It's not enough that S&amp;Ls no longer will be permitted to pretend
that they have $20 billion in the, uh, bank. The House last week
refused to let them count ``good will'' as a genuine capital asset.
If public opinion is worth anything, in fact, at least that much has
piled up on the debit side of he ledger.
   What catches our eye in the $285 billion bailout bill is not even
that incredible figure. It is the mandate to go after the crooks who
did a real number on the nation.
   When the measure comes up for final approval early in July, the
House and Senate plan to allocate at least $50 million a year to the
Justice Department through 1991 to detect and prosecute fraud at
financial institutions. The maximum civil penalty for ``reckless
disregard for safety'' will be $1 million a day. The criminal
penalties will be $1 million per day or imprisonment for up to five
years.
   Sound like a lot of money? Hey, somebody's got it. $300 billion
doesn't just evaporate. There are stories of S&amp;L bosses collecting
$8 million in bonuses as they threw money away like it wasn't theirs
_ which, of course, it wasn't.
   The Justice Department should bring in all the special
prosecutors it needs to find and convict these thieves.

   The Post-Crescent, Appleton-Neenah-Menasha, Wis., on children and
gun laws:
   A new Florida law imposes criminal penalties on parents whose
loaded weapons are not kept out of the reach of their children. ...
   In the wake of several recent shootings by Wisconsin children who
had such easy access, some legislators want a similar law here.
   We don't.
   The key to preventing horrible accidents of this nature is not to
lock up the weapons; the key is to get children to act responsibly
around the weapons in the first place. That can best be accomplished
not by punishing parents after their kids have shot someone, but by
educating the kids about gun safety, by acting before tragedy
strikes.
   Teaching children to handle guns properly is a far better
solution than thinking that hiding guns will make the problem go
away. It won't.

   The Columbian of Vancouver, Wash., on the HUD scandal:
   Teapot Dome, the notorious tale about public servants tapping the
federal till for private gain, blots the historical view of
President Warren Harding. The unfolding scandal in the recent
administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development may
stand as an even darker mark against Ronald Reagan.
   Harding died ... before the extent of Teapot Dome was clear. He
did not have to watch Secretary of Interior Albert B. Fall locked up
for taking more than $100,000 in bribes. Similarly, Reagan's
well-documented Teflon coating may keep the HUD mud from sticking to
him in the short run.
   The HUD scandal, however, shapes up as larger and more pernicious
than Teapot Dome. Whatever else historians write about the past
decade, they must reckon with massive expropriation of federal funds
by friends and former associates of Reagan. While thousands of
families and individuals daily fought for wretched shelter, while
construction of new subsidized housing dwindled, while the decay of
existing housing stock accelerated, well-connected Republicans used
HUD as a private slush fund.

   The State, Columbia, S.C., on President Bush's clean-air proposal:
   President Bush's clean-air package is an important first step in
reducing dangerous airborne pollutants and a welcome change from the
Reagan administration's do-nothing attitude.
   Predictably, some environmentalists say the Bush plan doesn't go
far enough, while coal, oil and auto industry officials say it
amounts to overkill. But Democrats and Republicans in Congress are
generally supportive of the President's three-pronged approach to
curb acid rain, urban smog and airborne toxic chemicals. ...
   Now Congress, which ... in areas that exceed one or more of the federal
   air pollution standards, that is good news, indeed.

   St. Albans (Vt.) Messenger on China:

   There is, in fact, nothing in the past month's events that holds
out the faintest hope that China's government will allow itself to

   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on the Supreme Court's death penalty
rulings:
   Even the most ardent advocates of capital punishment would be
hard pressed to defend a pair of Supreme Court decisions authorizing
executions for crimes committed by 16- and 17-year-old teen-agers
and the mentally retarded.
   While we still believe the death penalty is appropriate in
certain circumstances, such a sentence must never be taken lightly.
Proponents should start by admitting that protecting society from
specific violent killers is probably the death penalty's least
important function; in most circumstances, life without parole would
do as well, and given the high cost of legal appeals, at lower cost.
   But given the three traditional justifications for capital
punishment _ to deter those who would commit heinous crimes, to
punish those for whom rehabilitation is not possible, and as an act
of social ablution, or ritual cleansing _ killing teen-age criminals
serves little purpose. ...
   Killing them is neither measured justice, nor fitting
retribution; it's a spasm of vindictiveness, the least defensible of
all motivations.

   The slow-moving storm named Allison dumped more than a foot of
rain in the Houston area, flooding homes and roads, and spun off at
least eight tornadoes in Louisiana that tore into more than 100
houses, officials said.
   At least four deaths were blamed on Allison, which at its height
reached the status of tropical storm, the first of the Atlantic
hurricane season. A tropical storm is one step below a hurricane.
   Southeast Texas began drying out today, although scores of people
remained out of their homes because of streams and rivers that
continued to flood.
   But rain continued this morning in Louisiana, where the National
Weather Service reported more than 7 inches in Baton Rouge late
Tuesday and early today.
   Street flooding near Louisiana State University knocked out power
and canceled classes. Flooding also closed part of Interstate 110 in
Baton Rouge.
   Just south in Plaquemine, more than 150 homes had about 2 inches
of water in them, forcing the evacuation of about 20 people, Chief
Deputy Ralph Stassi said.
   ``This is the most rain that's fallen in this short a period of
time that I can remember,'' said Stassi.
   The tornadoes Tuesday moved along a mile-long path near Monroe,
La. No serious injuries were reported, but more than 100 homes were
damaged.
   Jachin Little, Ouachita Parish civil defense director, said five
of the homes were destroyed and 10 more had damage that made them
uninhabitable.
   Buddy Sharp, who sought safety in the bathroom of his home when
the twister hit, said he heard windows blow out and an outside wall
torn off.
   ``That is some awesome power,'' Sharp said. ``It takes anything
it wants, and does what it wants with it.''
   Meanwhile, a thunderstorm in Wapakoneta, Ohio, on Tuesday toppled
scores of trees and damaged several houses, tearing the corner off
of a brick home, officials said. No serious injuries were reported.
Wapakoneta is about 70 miles northwest of Columbus.
   ``It was overpowering,'' said Niki Dunham, who saw a 200-year-old
walnut tree in her backyard felled by the storm. ``It was like a big
black ball of smoke. It almost actually pushed me in the house. I
was terrified.''
   In Texas, Harris County Sheriff's Department divers pulled the
body of 18-year-old Don Gilliam from rain-swollen Spring Creek late
Tuesday. Friends said Gilliam went under while trying to swim across
the creek. On Monday, a traffic death in the Beaumont area was
blamed on the storm.
   A 7-year-old Houston girl survived an overnight ordeal inside a
storm sewer, clinging to the bricks for 12 hours before being
rescued by construction workers. Latricia Reese suffered cuts on her
knees and elbows and mild shock and was hospitalized in good
condition.
   Divers at Beaumont found the bodies of two boys, ages 15 and 16,
who disappeared Tuesday while playing on a rubber raft in a drainage
ditch, police said.
   For many Houston-area residents, the storm marked the second time
in six weeks that they were rousted from their homes by floods.
   ``We were just about finished with the work (from the May storm)
and I guess we'll have to rework it now,'' Bruce Jett said of his
home in nearby Spring, where 14 inches of rain fell.
   In Pasadena and Deer Park, southeastern suburbs of Houston, more
than 16 inches of rain was recorded in the past four days.
   Traffic resumed on Interstate 45 north of downtown Houston at
mid-afternoon Tuesday, nearly a full day after the main north-south
freeway was blocked by high water.
   Many side roads in the area remained flooded today.
   In its final statement on the progress of the storm, the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said Tuesday the center of
what was once Allison was breaking up about near Lufkin, Texas,
which is about 120 miles north of Houston.
   Allison on Monday became the first named storm of the 1989
Atlantic hurricane season when its sustained winds reached 39 mph.
It came ashore south of Houston and then inched its way through
southeast Texas at about 5 mph.

   A leading underground publisher in
Czechoslovakia was convicted Wednesday on charges of incitement to
riot and sentenced to 2{ years in jail, emigre sources said.
   Frantisek Starek and his companion, Iva Vojtkova, were convicted
in the town of Usti nad Orlice, 90 miles east of Prague.
   Ms. Vojtkova received a 12-month sentence that was reduced to two
years' probation, the sources said.
   After serving his jail time, Starek will remain under police
observation for two years and report to police every day, said the
sources, who requested anonimity.
   Starek, 36, chief editor of the underground magazine Vokno,
already has served two prison sentences for his independent
activities since 1975.
   He was arrested in February after police confiscated his
magazine's archives. ``An important source of information on
independent culture in Czechoslovakia in the last 20 years was
lost,'' according to the Vienna-based International Helsinki
Federation, a human rights group.

   A person born during the year 1900 could
expect to live to be 50 years old. Today, a person's life expectancy
at birth is 75 years, a full generation longer. Why are people
living longer? What do these extra years mean to the individual, to
the family, to society?
   How long a person lives depends on several factors: genetics,
medical advances, lifestyle, and environmental assaults.
   Science and medicine have given us antibiotics, vaccines and
better medical care so that illnesses once fatal no longer are.
People are more aware than ever of changes in lifestyle that affect
health: eating a well-balanced diet that limits fats and increases
fiber, exercising sensibly, wearing seat belts, quitting smoking,
and drinking little, if any, alcohol, have all contributed to
longer, healthier lives. Governmental regulations have eliminated
many concerns about the food we eat, the water we drink and the air
we breathe.
   Some 20 or 30 years ago, people believed that getting old meant
an inevitable decline of health and intellectual function. In fact,
many medical textbooks still use the word ``senile'' to describe
people who suffer confusion and memory loss and imply that this
condition is a natural consequence of age.
   Today, thanks to studies on normal human aging, we know that
people can live to be 100 and more with no evidence of heart disease
or memory impairment. Scientists also have concluded that
personality does not change with age. In fact, there are few, if
any, changes that occur to all people as they grow old.
   Despite these results, there are many people for whom aging is no
joy. I recently met a woman in her mid-70s who confided, ``No one
ever told me that growing old hurts so much.'' Many older people
become dependent on family members and society because of
debilitating conditions that severely restrict their independence.
Arthritis, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease, to name a few, are
problems for which science and society have not yet found adequate
solutions. A person should be able to remain functional and vigorous
throughout life.
   As director of the National Institute on Aging at the National
Institutes of Health, I am all too frequently asked, ``Is this what
I have to look forward to as I grow old?'' Studies that help us to
understand and eliminate the afflictions that rob a person of
independence are a high priority among researchers around the world.
   Make no mistake, we have made progress. For example, we have the
expertise to treat certain forms of urinary incontinence, we have
identified the risk factors that make falls and subsequent fractures
likely, and we understand the benefits of early rehabilitation after
stroke.
   Because of these and other successes, many children today know
their grandparents, and even their great grandparents. In many
cases, grandparents are an integral part of the family and are
called upon to lend support to the family unit. This is all very
positive. However, new problems arise as many grown children are
called upon to care for a frail parent or relative. For many, the
caregiving role is fraught with doubts, guilt, tedium and fears, and
indeed is an area which requires innovative approaches to best serve
all concerned.
   To society, the implications of the growing number of older
people is still confusing. Many healthy older people do not choose
retirement. They wish to remain employed. Health-care systems do not
yet know how to respond to the growing number of people who require
long-term care. Health professionals and policymakers need to sort
out the ramifications of having so many older people in need of
assistance.
   From the day you are born you begin to age. No matter how old you
are, aging issues apply. I hope this information will serve to
eliminate some of the common fears many of us have about growing old.

<HEAD>Uno Denies Reports He Threatened to Resign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, chosen by the governing
party as a ``Mr. Clean'' to rescue it from scandal, was kept busy
Wednesday denying he might resign because of allegations about his
sexual conduct.
   In exchanges with reporters throughout the day, Uno repeatedly
denied reports that, in meetings Tuesday night, leaders of his
Liberal Democratic Party had to persuade him not to resign over of
allegations he kept paid mistresses.
   Stock prices plunged despite the denials.
   According to the reports, Uno told party leaders the accusations
insulted his dignity and made it difficult for him to meet other
world leaders.
   ``Political Situation Appears Increasingly Fluid,'' said a
headline in the national newspaper Asahi, and the financial
newspaper Nihon Keizai declared: ``Omen of Confusion in Politics.''
   Uno said Wednesday ``I'm not such an irresponsible person'' as to
resign before making political reforms he promised on taking office
June 2. He told legislators and businessmen at a trade meeting he
would attend the summit of seven industrialized nations in Paris
next month.
   He was foreign minister when he replaced Noboru Takeshita, who
resigned to take responsibility for the scandal involving Recruit
Co., an information and publishing conglomerate accused of trying to
buy influence with bribes and cut-price stock.
   Reports about Uno's alleged ``woman problem'' have incresed in
the past week.
   Mitsuko Nakanishi, a former geisha, said on television Sunday the
prime minister, who is married, paid her to be his mistress in 1985.
The same allegation had appeared in a national magazine, without
naming Ms. Nakanishi.
   Two weekly magazines said later that Uno kept two other
mistresses.
   One reported that a former geisha known professionally as Hatsuko
said she was paid 100,000 yen ($700) a month for 10 years until
1985. The other quoted his former secretary as saying that, from
1962 to 1972, Uno paid an unknown sum to a Ginza bar hostess
identified only as Ms. Y, who became pregnant and had an abortion.
   Foreign exchange dealers attributed a sharp decline in the value
of the yen Wednesday to fears of political instability. The dollar
closed at 143.55 yen, up 2.32 yen from Tuesday's close.
   Daiwa Bank's Kenji Ishizuka said most of a 0.67 percent drop in
the main Tokyo Stock Exchange index was due to ``politicians'
inability to resolve their problems.''
   After Takeshita decided to resign because of the Recruit scandal,
which led to the resignations of three Cabinet ministers, the party
spent a month searching for a scandal-free successor. Uno was chosen
after Masayoshi Ito, a noted reformer, refused the job.
   In Parliament earlier this week, Uno would not answer questions
about the alleged affair with Ms. Nakanishi, calling it a private
matter. On Wednesday, he repeated his previous comment that ``I've
never done anything contrary to morality.''
   Women's groups have demanded that he explain his actions,
threatening to campaign against his party otherwise. The Liberal
Democratic Party has governed Japan since it was formed in 1955.
   The Liberal Democrats were shaken Sunday by a defeat in an upper
house by-election at Niigata in northeast Japan, which is
traditionally conservative but elected a woman running for the
Socialist Party.
   Elections for the Tokyo Municipal Assembly are scheduled for the
weekend and half the upper house of Parliament is to be chosen next
month.
   On Wednesday, an Asahi editorial on Uno's problems declared: ``It
is bizarre indeed that this man is being forced, for personal
reasons, to virtually hide from the voting public right before
important elections. He is totally lacking in class.''

   Skipp Porteous has a solution to
the flag-burning controversy sweeping America: Fireproof flags.
   ``It's a great country,'' said Porteous, who is publisher of a
newsletter called The Freedom Writer. ``You can burn the flag. But
you can't burn my flag.''
   Porteous supports the U.S. Supreme Court ruling extending First
Amendment protection to people who burn the flag in protest.
   ``The court's decision is awesome,'' he said Tuesday. ``I'm glad
I have the freedom to burn the flag, but I'm even gladder I have the
sense not to.''
   Porteous purchased a supply of flags from a manufacturer near
Boston. He treats them with a fire-retardant called ``Cease Fire.''
   He is selling the treated flags for $10 and said proceeds will go
toward a commemoration of the ratification of the Bill of Rights
that he plans later this year.

   The gunman who killed a rookie policeman guarding
the home of a drug witness was sentenced today to 25 years to life
in prison, becoming the fourth and final defendant in the 1988
slaying to get the maximum term.
   Supreme Court Justice Thomas Demakos imposed the sentence on
David McClary, 23, who was found guilty June 6 of firing five shots
at close range at 22-year-old Officer Edward Byrne as he sat in his
patrol car.
   McClary and co-defendants Scott Cobb, Todd Scott and Philip
Copeland were convicted of murdering Byrne on orders from reputed
drug kingpin Howard ``Pappy'' Mason, who allegedly wanted to avenge
his jailing on a weapons charge.
   Prosecutors charged Copeland masterminded the killing, while
Scott was the lookout and Cobb the getaway driver.
   The murder received national attention during the 1988
presidential campaign when the slain officer's father, Matthew
Byrne, presented his son's shield to President Bush during a rally
in favor of the death penalty.
   Demakos, in sentencing McClary's co-defendants, promised that his
last act as a judge would be to ask the parole board never to
release them.

   To those who knew Glenn Michael Souther
before he defected to the Soviet Union, he was a rambunctious
college student who liked to play pranks.
   But his obituary in a Soviet military newspaper called him a KGB
spy who ``made a great contribution to maintaining the Soviet
Union's security.''
   Today, the head of the KGB said Souther, a former U.S. Navy
intelligence analyst, broke under the pressure of his work and
committed suicide.
   Souther, 32, defected to the Soviet Union and rose to become a
major in the Soviet KGB. Yet ``his nervous system could not stand
the pressure ...,'' Gen. Vladimir Kryuchkov told reporters in Moscow
outside the meeting hall of the Soviet legislature.
   Souther, Kryuchkov said, took his life last week and left a note
thanking the Soviet government for what it did for him personally.
   The spy chief would not say how Souther committed suicide.
   The obituary on Tuesday identified Souther by the Russian name of
Mikhail Orlov, a name he took when he arrived in the Soviet Union,
Kryuchkov said.
   The name had led to speculation that Souther ws a Russian mole
rather than an American defector.
   Kryuchkov said Souther left behind a Russian wife and daughter
and was buried Monday in the same cemetery as Kim Philby, the
British traitor who spied for Moscow. He said Souther's parents and
brother traveled to Moscow from the United States for the funeral.
   Some of the people who knew Souther as a Russian major at Old
Dominion University speculated he committed suicide because of his
disillusionment with the Soviet Union.
   ``They used him like a spider playing with a moth and when they
were going to finish with him, they finished with him,'' said
Barbara Fahey, a professor's wife who knew him in school.
   Others said he could have turned Soviet spy but they doubt he was
a mole who masqueraded as an American during four years at Old
Dominion and an eight-year Navy enlisted career that included
intelligence work.
   ``He was not a Soviet. I can assure you of that,'' said Ms.
Fahey's husband, John, a retired Navy commander who taught Russian
to Souther at Old Dominion.
   Fahey said the Soviets may have described Souther as one of their
own to prevent the United States from investigating his death.
``Despite glasnost, disinformation is not dead in the Soviet
Union,'' he said.
   The Faheys remembered Souther as a prankster who loved to be the
center of attention.
   ``He wanted to be the life of the party,'' Mrs. Fahey said. ``I
felt he was screaming out to be seen and heard.''
   Souther's outgoing personality may have been ill-suited to the
Soviet Union, the Faheys said.
   ``I'm sure he was depressed after they got through with him and
debriefed him. He would not get the recognition or attention
there,'' Fahey said. ``The dismal life there I'm sure was a shock to
him.''
   Ronald Kessler, a writer preparing a book on Souther, said his
research shows Souther was an American who became a Soviet spy.
   ``He was in fact a very successful spy,'' Kessler said in a
telephone interview from his Potomac, Md., home. ``It's possible
that he took this Russian name after he defected.''
   Kessler said Souther referred to ``my life's vicissitudes'' in a
letter he sent the writer this month. ``He was perhaps having second
thoughts or having trouble adjusting over there,'' Kessler said.
   Souther enlisted in the Navy in 1975 and was honorably discharged
in 1982 with the rank of petty officer first class. He served in the
Naval Reserve until May 1986.
   That's when he disappeared. He turned up on Soviet television
last July, saying he had defected because he was being harassed by
the FBI. Souther indicated in the broadcast that he was dissatisfied
with his new life although he had a comfortable Moscow apartment.
   ``I haven't found my niche exactly. I don't feel that I'm being
the most productive for what I have to offer,'' he said.
   Souther had been married to an Italian woman and had a son with
her before they divorced, said Fran Hassencahl, his speech professor
at Old Dominion. Ms. Hassencahl said he was engaged to an American
woman when he defected.
   Kessler said he had been told Souther was in excellent health and
rode his bicycle regularly in the Soviet Union.
   ``There's no reason to believe that he would die so early,'' he
said. ``Any kind of violent death should be considered.''
   Dennis Leighton, who knew Souther in the mid-1970s when they
attended high school in Cumberland, Maine, said he was surprised
when he found out about the defection.
   ``To me, he was just a regular guy who ran track and
cross-country. There was nothing unusual,'' said Leighton, a
physical therapist in Portland, Maine. ``If he was a Russian, he had
me fooled. He wasn't political or anything.''
   One of Souther's campus pranks may have led to his decision to
defect, Fahey said. Because he was suspended from Old Dominion in
1984 for biting a female student on the neck, Souther was turned
down for Navy's officer candidate school.
   ``He was very bitter about what happened to him as far as the
problem on campus,'' Fahey said. ``He really wanted to become a
naval officer.''

<HEAD>Democratic Fund-Raisers Recruiting Women Candidates for Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic fund-raisers said Wednesday they are
recruiting women to run for dozens of open and swing House seats
expected to result from the 1992 overhaul of the nation's
congressional districts.
   ``This is the critical moment,'' said Rosa DeLauro, executive
director of EMILY's List, which has raised nearly $1 million for
Democratic women candidates in the last four years.
   Women, who make up about 6 percent of the House, have increased
their numbers only three times in 20 years: in 1972 and 1982 after
redistricting, and in 1988. EMILY's List, an acronym for Early Money
Is Like Yeast, attributes the 1988 increase largely to its own
fund-raising activities on behalf of several women who are now House
freshmen.
   The group estimates there will be 80 open seats as a result of
redistricting, retirement and electoral changes in 1992. Recruiters
are already trying to identify potential women candidates for 1992
and 1994 as part of a long-term Majority Project.
   Asked how the list intends to make sure Democratic women pre-empt
the Democratic men who no doubt will be interested in running for
the same open seats, DeLauro replied, ``We're going to find them
fast.''
   ``And give them money,'' added Celinda Lake, a consultant
studying women's House campaigns.
   DeLauro said the Majority Project also is looking at which women
incumbents may be vulnerable due to the 1992 redistricting process
and will help them work closely with Democrats in the state
legislatures charged with drawing the new lines.
   Democratic incumbents with districts likely to change are Reps.
Louise Slaughter and Nita Lowey of New York, according to Mark Gersh
of the National Committee for an Effective Congress, a political
action committee working with EMILY's List.
   Gersh said the two districts, in the suburbs of Rochester and New
York City, don't have enough people and whatever changes are made
could either solidify or weaken the two women's positions.
   Gersh also said Rep. Jill Long, D-Ind., was elected in a
Republican district and any subtle boundary changes could affect her
future. He said the greater Cleveland area stands to lose a seat,
affecting any one of six or seven incumbents. One of them, Rep. Mary
Rose Oakar, is a Democratic woman.
   Open seat opportunities are expected to abound in California,
Texas and Florida because of population shifts. California
anticipates a gain of five to seven seats during reapportionment,
while the other two should win at least three seats each.
   Many of the new seats will be in suburban areas, a factor the
strategists said bodes well for women. According to Lake, women
become increasingly attractive candidates as income level rises and
the proportion of women under 45 working outside the home increases.

   From a deserted strip of highway to the muscle-bound
athletes of a high school football team, the many faces of the
American South are on display at the International Photography
Festival in the city of Arles.
   ``The Deep South,'' at the Palais de l'Archeveche from July 2
through Sept. 3, features 200 pictures by 18 American and European
photographers. Some of the photos date back to 1930.
   ``The South has long been photography's poor relative because
it's so difficult to photograph,'' said Gilles Mora, the show's
curator. ``There is racial tension, and then, there are the
protectionist attitudes of the people who resent outside cultural
influences.''
   American photographer Robert Frank's pictures of Birmingham,
Ala., focus on the city's down-and-out residents.
   Frank gave up photography 20 years ago to pursue a career in the
movies, but he picked up his camera again last year to photograph
Birmingham's centennial celebrations at the request of the
Birmingham News.
   Also on show are works by Bruce Davidson, best known for his
pictures of the New York subway and East 100th Street in Harlem. For
``The Deep South,'' he shot firefighters, doctors and police.
   Mora, a photographer who spent four years teaching French in
Louisiana, says the French are particularly fond of the South.
   ``It's the only place in the United States where there's a life
for the senses. There are smells, people live outdoors and take
walks. They handle problems with a kind of inefficient and relaxed
detachment reminiscent of southern France, Italy and other Latin
countries,'' Mora said.
   ``The South is a unique juxtaposition of kitsch and class, luxury
and poverty.''
   In the 1930s, dozens of American photographers immortalized the
Works Project Administration, the government sponsored building and
improvement project that created jobs for the unemployed between
1935-43.
   ``The photos show that the South hasn't gone down hill. Things
are remarkably unchanged,'' Mora said. ``There are the same
landscapes and cityscapes, and the people show the same pride and
the same mistrust of outsiders.''

<HEAD>Return of Wolves to Yellowstone Urged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morning Star rested quietly on the Capitol lawn
Wednesday, fixing her yellow eyes on the crowd as politicians and
conservationists advocated the return of her species, the timber
wolf, to Yellowstone National Park.
   ``Wolves don't eat little children,'' stressed Rep. Wayne Owens,
D-Utah, sponsor of a bill requiring the National Park Service to do
an environmental impact study on returning wolves to Yellowstone.
   Wolves have gotten an undeserved bad reputation because they
``howl at night and scare people ... and compete with us for food,''
said Owens.
   Even as Owens was discussing his measure, Sen. Alan K. Simpson,
R-Wyo., was attacking it in a statement issued in Cheyenne.
   Simpson, an opponent of returning wolves to Yellowstone,
condemned Owens' bill as ``a misguided and zealous effort to
accelerate wolf reintroduction without considering in any way how
wolves will affect other animals in Yellowstone Park and the very
real human beings that also live in Wyoming.''
   ``He's half right, I am zealous,'' Owens responded in Washington.
   Owens' bill does not require the reintroduction of wolves to the
park. Rather, it directs the Park Service to begin a study of what
the impact would be if wolves were returned, and sets a date of Dec.
31, 1991, for completion of that report.
   ``It has been 60 years since a wolf's howl has been heard in
Yellowstone,'' M. Rupert Cutler, president of the conservation group
Defenders of Wildlife, said in Washington. ``It never should have
been silenced.''
   Morning Star, a 13-month-old female gray wolf, shifted her long
legs and panted slightly in the capital's summer heat and humidity,
but otherwise seemed uninterested in the speeches and cameras.
   She yawned languidly as Owens expounded on her docility,
tolerating petting from him and her handlers, from Wolf Haven, a
refuge near Olympia, Wash., that cares for abandoned wolves.
   Wolves were exterminated from Yellowstone by hunters and
government trappers, Cutler said, with the result that today
``thousands of elk and bison are overgrazing the Yellowstone range
and many starve to death every winter.
   ``Wolves are needed in the Northern Rockies to restore the
natural balance among animals,'' said Cutler.
   Although backed by Defenders of Wildlife, the National Wildlife
Federation, the National Parks and Conservation Association and
other national and local conservation groups, Owens' measure may
face rough going due to opposition from ranchers who fear wolves
will eat their sheep and cattle.
   Owens said he has invited Simpson to travel to Canada with him to
see a park where wolves live peacefully, not bothering nearby
livestock.
   And Cutler pointed out that Defenders of Wildlife has raised a
special fund to compensate any rancher in the Yellowstone area
losing stock to wolves.
   Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich., said he was co-sponsoring the
measure as a way of ``trying to make amends to nature for what our
predecessors did.''
   Asked how he would respond to residents who contend he is
interfering in local affairs of the park region, Owens said that
``they don't own the park ... the park belongs to all Americans.''
   While wolves once roamed over much of the area currently occupied
by the United States, they were relentlessly hunted and poisoned in
the last century. Today, only Alaska has large numbers of wolves,
with about 1,200 in northern Minnesota and a few reported in
Michigan and Montana.

   A clot-busting drug that interrupts heart attacks
has been redesigned to work longer, which might reduce the risk of a
second heart attack after treatment.
   In test tube experiments, an altered version of a drug called
tissue plasminogen activator remained largely potent when exposed to
substances in blood that de-activate the current form of the drug.
   The work is described in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature by researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center in Dallas and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
there.
   It will take animal studies to assess the persistence of altered
forms of the drug, said study co-author Joseph Sambrook, of the
medical center, on Wednesday.
   Most heart attacks occur when a clot plugs an artery that feeds
blood to part of the heart muscle. Tissue plasminogen activator,
called TPA, can stop a heart attack by dissolving the clot.
   But some patients who get TPA therapy develop another clot after
the treatment stops, putting them at risk for another heart attack.
If TPA can be made to remain active longer, it may reduce the
tendency toward forming clots after therapy stops, said Thomas J.
Ryan, chief of cardiology at Boston University.
   TPA's effectiveness is limited not only by inactivation, but also
because the drug is removed from the bloodstream by the liver. That
is why animal studies are needed to assess persistence of altered
versions, said Edgar Haber, president of the Squibb Institute for
Medical Research in Princeton, N.J.
   Some researchers have altered TPA to hamper removal by the liver,
and perhaps that approach can be combined with that of the new study
to create a longer-lasting drug, Haber said.
   Sambrook said a longer-lasting TPA might make treatment cheaper
because smaller doses could be used. Currently, because a given dose
works only briefly, TPA must be given as a continuous infusion over
a few hours, he said.
   The treatment costs about $2,000, some 10 times that of using
another clot-busting drug, streptokinase, which is administered as a
single injection.

<HEAD>Opposition Lawmaker Arrested for Illegal Trip to North Korea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government's intelligence agency
arrested an opposition lawmaker Wednesday for illegally visiting
communist North Korea to discuss unification of the countries.
   Also on Wednesday, about 2,000 radical students battled riot
police at two universities to protest a government ban on
participation in an international youth festival in North Korea.
   The Agency for National Security Planning said Suh Kyung-won of
the Party for Peace and Democracy was arrested for secretly visiting
North Korea in August and meeting with the nation's leader, Kim Il
Sung.
   Suh's party, South Korea's largest opposition group, apologized
and called his trip ``a reckless act.''
   Suh, 52, was charged with violating the National Security Law,
which carries a maximum sentence of death, security officials said.
   President Roh Tae-woo said Suh's trip to Pyongyang was ``a really
shocking incident'' and called for firm measures against the leftist
movement.
   He also dismissed calls by radical students for the withdrawal of
the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual
defense treaty. Roh said the troops contribute to peace and
stability.
   About 1,500 radical students from Seoul and other cities gathered
at Hanyang University in the capital and clashed with about 3,500
riot police.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' groups of masked students shouted as they
marched and attacked police with firebombs, rocks and clubs.
   Police responded with barrages of tear gas and threw back rocks
hurled by students. Authorities said dozens of officers suffered
minor injuries.
   Police arrested more than 100 students trying to enter the
school, they said.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, reported similar clashes at
Hannam University in the city of Taejon, where police blocked about
600 students from leaving for Seoul.
   Student protesters have called for marches to Panmunjom, the
border truce village in the demilitarized zone, to press their
demand to be allowed to participate in the weeklong North Korean
festival, which begins Saturday in Pyongyang.
   Students say they want to attend the festival to help advance
unification. Seoul accuses North Korea of using the festival to
dramatize its demand for the withdrawal of U.S. forces.
   South Koreans have been barred from visiting North Korea without
government permission since the nations fought the Korean war from
1950-53. Korea was divided in 1945 at the end of World War II.
   Security officials charged Wednesday there are about 10,000
leftists in South Korea seeking revolution and unification with
North Korea. They said leftists and communists in South Korea

<HEAD>Two Boys Talk Their Way Onto Plane for Free Flight to Detroit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two runaway boys who may have been trying to get
to Walt Disney World at Orlando, Fla., talked their way onto a
United Airlines flight and ended up with a free trip to Detroit,
officials say.
   ``Our understanding is that it was late at night, they said they
had lost their tickets, and they were crying,'' said United
spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``They were not stowaways. We boarded them.''
   ``Their version of the story was that they went up to a ticket
agent, said they had deplaned in Chicago, and lost their boarding
passes and that their parents were on the plane,'' said Nancy
Mouradian, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County sheriff's department
in Detroit.
   When the boys, aged 12 and 14, arrived in Detroit early Tuesday
they told an airline employee that someone was supposed to meet
them, Hopkins said.
   They were taken to a United office, but wandered away and were
later stopped by a sheriff's deputy.
   Ms. Mouradian said authorities in Chicago said one of the boys
had been reported missing. One was returned home by plane, the other
by bus.
   ``When they asked why they came to Detroit, they didn't know,''
Ms. Mouradian said. ``One of the boys said he'd like to get to
Orlando. I guess Orlando sounds pretty good this time of year.''

   President Bush planned to send Congress late
today his proposal for a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag
desecration, his spokesman announced.
   ``It was a matter he felt strongly about and which he wanted to
present to the American people,'' said White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush on Tuesday joined a chorus of lawmakers in calling for such
an amendment to nullify last week's Supreme Court ruling overturning
state flag-desecration laws.
   However, House Speaker Thomas Foley said the House will not rush
to nullify the Supreme Court decision. He contends the issue should
not be used for ``crass political purposes.''
   Moving to slow down a possible stampede for constitutional
change, Foley announced Tuesday that hearings will be held in July
on setting aside the court ruling that threw out flag desecration
laws in 48 states.
   Fitzwater said Bush had consulted with attorneys on details of
his proposed amendment, and that a number of proposals already had
been advanced on Capitol Hill. ``It's not like there's a clear plate
here,'' he said. ``There's been a lot of drafting done on the Hill.''
   Fitzwater did not divulge specific details of Bush's proposal.
   The president has proclaimed that a constitutional amendment _ a
process used only 26 times in the nation's history _ is the only
solution to change the 5-4 ruling.
   Foley, D-Wash., said the House Judiciary Committee hearings ``are
not going to be rushed but they will not be obstructive.'' They will
``be conducted calmly in the spirit of deliberation and care ... we
are not seeking to inflame this issue,'' he told reporters.
   Foley called a constitutional change ``a very deeply felt matter
and ... also one which touches upon the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution, which is the source of the most sacred
personal values of this country: freedom of speech, freedom of
religious worship and freedom of the press.''
   A proposed 27th Amendment might attempt to carve out a specific
and narrow exception to the First Amendment's free-speech protection
for flag burning. But free-speech advocates said any such effort
endangers all freedom of expression.
   ``The minute you establish the principle that there can be
exceptions to the First Amendment for offensive speech, there's no
principled way to limit it,'' Ira Glasser, executive director of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said today.
   ``The first exception will not be the last,'' Glasser added.
``Someone adds an exception for derogatory racial remarks. If you're
a woman you want an exception for Playboy. If you're a Jew you want
an exception for Nazis marching. Pretty soon, you don't have a First
Amendment.''
   With senators already home for their July 4 break, Foley gave
House members outraged by last week's ruling a chance to vent their
feelings. He scheduled an immediate vote on a non-binding resolution
expressing ``profound concern'' over the decision, and the House
passed it, 411-5.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.,
said Tuesday he favors seeking to nullify the ruling by passing
legislation to prohibit burning the flag. A law can be ruled
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, interviewed today on ``CBS This
Morning,'' noted that the courts still would have a role in
interpreting the amendment.
   ``If the constitutional amendment is passed, it will obviously
require some implementing legislation at both the federal and state
level if the Congress and state legislators want to follow through
on it effectively, and the terms of that legislation would then be
subject to construction in the courts,'' he said.
   Foley told reporters he will vigorously fight any attempt by
conservative Republicans to use the flag issue against Democrats.
President Bush scored points against Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis last year by criticizing the Massachusetts
governor's veto of legislation that would have required the state's
public school teachers to lead daily pledges of allegiance to the
flag.
   ``I am sure there will be people trying to play politics with
it,'' Foley said. ``Anybody who suggests that there is a party
difference in respect for the American flag is using this deep
affection of Americans, twisting it, manipulating it, using it for
the most base and crass political purposes. It would be
reprehensible and disgusting. I am condemning those who are doing
it.''
   But Bush said earlier Tuesday at a news conference, ``I think
respect for the flag transcends political party and I think what
I've said here is American. It isn't Republican or Democrat, it
isn't liberal or conservative.''
   Debate on the resolution, sponsored by House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, was often emotional despite the
non-binding nature of the language.
   Rep. Carroll Hubbard Jr., D-Ky., asked those who burn the flag to
``consider moving to Iran, China or Cuba, where burning the flag ...
is encouraged.''
   But Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., said the court acted correctly to
preserve freedom of speech, adding, ``I exult in the decision ...
because the Supreme Court has validated once again the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights.''
   Saying he personally deplored desecration of the flag, Weiss
cautioned members against ``reckless tampering with the
Constitution.''
   Voting along with Weiss against the resolution were Reps. Gus
Savage, D-Ill.; Ronald Dellums, D-Calif.; William Clay, D-Mo., and
George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich.
   The House hearings could be held by the full Judiciary Committee,
but Brooks could assign them to the civil rights subcommittee headed
by Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., a strong supporter of the court
decision.
   Edwards pledged Tuesday he will ``not try by any trick to bury''
a proposed constitutional amendment, but added that he hopes people
will ``think about the risk they are taking for freedom of speech.''
   Bush, declaring the American flag a ``unique national symbol,''
said Tuesday, ``As president, I will uphold our precious right to
dissent, but burning the flag goes too far, and I want to see that
matter remedied.''
   A constitutional amendment is ratified after a two-thirds vote by
both houses of Congress and approval by legislatures of 38 states.

   The Batman family feels this town has
too many jokers.
   James F. Batman said Wednesday the blockbuster movie featuring
the caped crusader has kept his family awake nights with phone calls
from fans of the comic-book crime fighter.
   Batman, owner of Batman Trophies, says he and his wife haven't
got so much attention _ or so little sleep _ since the Batman
television series in the 1960s.
   ``It's usually kids, but sometimes it's guys at the plant without
enough to do,'' he said.
   ``We just all go along with it, every once you get a kid who
wants to meet the real Batman and it's nice.''
   Batman says he also attracts attention when he goes on the road
for business.
   ``A few years ago I arrived at a Holiday Inn and the sign outside
said `Sleep safe tonight. Batman is here,''' he said in a Batphone
interview.
   ``My grandson's name is Bruce Batman. He's a freshman at
Transylvania University in Kentucky, so he gets more than his share
of mileage out of it.''

<HEAD>House Passes Bill Aimed at Freeing Mother in Custody Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a
bill aimed at freeing a woman jailed nearly two years by a judge for
refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter in a
child-custody case.
   The bill would require prosecutors in the District of Columbia to
release or to file criminal contempt charges _ guaranteeing a trial
and the possibility of bail _ against anyone who had been held more
than 12 months for civil contempt of court.
   The measure, which passed by a 376-34 margin, is designed to
apply retroactively to the case of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a local
plastic surgeon.
   She was jailed for civil contempt in August 1987 after refusing
to produce her daughter Hilary for court-ordered visits with Dr.
Eric Foretich, her ex-husband and the girl's father.
   Morgan hid Hilary after alleging that Foretich had sexually
abused the 6-year-old girl; Foretich has repeatedly denied those
charges.
   Before the legislation could take effect, the Senate would have
to act as well. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has introduced a similar
bill, but it has not yet been debated.
   Congress has review power over all District of Columbia laws, but
rarely uses its right to intervene in the city's court system.
   Morgan's case now stands before the city's appeals court, which
is reviewing D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon's May 11
decision to keep her behind bars until she reveals where her
daughter is.
   The case has gained national attention as women's rights groups
and organizations concerned with child abuse have rallied to
Morgan's defense. Foretich has been backed by several fathers'
groups.
   ``The controversy (involving Morgan) is not the issue we're
addressing ... we're addressing a flaw in the criminal justice
system,'' the bill's sponsor, Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., said during
floor debate. ``The flaw is that anyone _ including Dr. Morgan _ can
remain behind bars indefinitely on civil contempt charges.''
   The bill survived despite protests that it would set a dangerous
precedent in child custody battles and complaints that Congress
should not intrude on city court matters.
   ``This interferes with an ongoing court case, and that is bad
public policy,'' Rep. Herbert Bateman said during debate on the
bill. ``If this is such a good idea, we should have done it for all
50 states.''
   ``Don't apply it just to Dr. Morgan's case _ apply it to others
and see if it fits,'' pleaded Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. ``I have
no doubt that this case is based on conscience, but tomorrow's case
may be malice.''
   Stephen Sachs, Morgan's attorney, has repeatedly asked Dixon to
file criminal contempt charges against Morgan so that she can
receive a jury trial. Sachs declined to comment on the measure
Wednesday.
   Elaine Mittleman, Foretich's attorney, said, ``This is clearly a
special bill that is being passed just to benefit Dr. Morgan. ...
Dr. Foretich's rights as a father are being absolutely violated.''
   Only two states _ Wisconsin and California _ have similar limits
on civil contempt of court jailings.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. company and a Japanese
manufacturer sold hundreds of thousands of substandard nuts and
bolts to the Pentagon and the Comanche Peak nuclear plant, the
Justice Department charged today.
   The indictment unsealed today names Yamaguchi-Seisakusho Co. of
Shizuoka, Japan, and Aircom Fasteners Inc. of Arlington.
   The nuts and bolts were used in a variety of items, including
tractor-trailers and other military vehicles and nuclear plants. But
authorities today said they don't know for sure where all the
fasteners ended up.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported today that the bolts, which
were of an inferior composition but labeled as if they were made of
higher-quality material, have been blamed for at least two
accidents, in which no one was hurt.
   ``It's like if someone orders a Cadillac and you slap a Cadillac
emblem on a Chevrolet and sell it as a Cadillac,'' said Jim Slick,
agent in charge of the defense criminal investigative service in the
Fort Worth office of the Inspector General's office.
   U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins said he expects six Aircom employees
to surrender today. Marcy Forman, Customs supervisor in Houston,
said the government will seek extradition of five employees of the
Japanese manufacturer.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Aircom said no one was in
the office and ``we've got nothing to say'' before hanging up.
   The Defense Department and TU Electric, owner of Comanche Peak,
ordered bolts with high tensile strength, meaning they would break
only under extreme conditions.
   But federal officials contend Yamaguchi Seisakusho used low-grade
boron in its bolts instead of stronger steel alloys, the
Star-Telegram reported. The bolts tend to fail prematurely when put
under stress.
   Slick said, ``We had several products that did not work because
of the substandard fasteners and that constituted a safety problem.''
   Slick and Brooks Griffin, an investigator with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, said they don't know where all the bolts
ended up and to what extent they were used.
   Griffin said some of the bolts were taken out of a system that
removes heat from the reactor core at the nearly operational
Comanche Peak in Glen Rose. He would not speculate on what would
have happened had the bolts never been discovered.
   Peterbilt Motors Co. had to recall many of its trucks, including
several used by the government to haul nuclear Minuteman missiles,
after learning in 1988 that Aircom bolts used in the steering
mechanism were failing, causing drivers to lose control, the
Star-Telegram said.
   At least two mishaps occurred before the recall, but no injuries
were reported, the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources.
   The investigation began 2{ years ago when the Pentagon was tipped
by industry sources, authorities said.

<HEAD>KGB Chief Says American Spy Committed Suicide</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS last graf, `Souther left...' with one graf with teacher

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy intelligence analyst who spied for the
Soviet Union was a sensitive and emotional man who broke under the
pressure of his work and committed suicide, the head of the KGB said
today.
   Glenn Michael Souther, 32, defected to the Soviet Union and rose
to become a major in the Soviet KGB. Yet ``his nervous system could
not stand the pressure. This was apparent even in his homeland,''
where life as a spy was far from simple, Gen. Vladimir Kryuchkov
told reporters outside the meeting hall of the Soviet legislature.
   Kryuchkov, in a rare admission of Soviet spying, said Souther
took his life last week and left a note thanking the Soviet
government for what it did for him personally.
   ``The motive was not political,'' Kryuchkov said. ``He long ago
started to show a nervous state of mind. He was a gifted, emotional,
caring, sensitive person. He was easily hurt.''
   The spy chief would not say how Souther committed suicide.
   He said the U.S.-born Souther began working for the KGB ``several
years before he came to the Soviet Union.''
   When Souther defected in May 1986 the FBI was investigating him
on charges of spying. He appeared on Soviet television in July 1988,
when the Soviets announced the defection, and said the FBI was
harassing him.
   A Soviet obituary, which appeared Tuesday in the military
newspaper Red Star, identified Souther first by the Russian name of
Mikhail Orlov, which he took when he arrived in the Soviet Union,
Kryuchkov said.
   The name had led to speculation that he was a Russian mole rather
than an American defector.
   Kryuchkov said Souther was born in the United States and that his
parents, brother and sister had traveled to Moscow for the funeral.
He said Souther was buried Monday in the military section of
Kuntsevo Cemetary, the resting place of the late British traitor Kim
Philby.
   The FBI said Souther was born in Hammond, Ind., and went to high
school in Cumberland, Maine. He served in the Navy in the 1970s, and
then went to work as a civilian intelligence specialist in the
Navy's 2nd Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va.
   ``I am very sorry he died at the age of 32,'' Kryuchkov said.
``It was also a personal loss. I met him several times.''
   Souther is survived by a Russian wife and 18-month-old daughter.
His former speech teacher at Old Dominion University, Fran
Hassencahl, said Souther previouly had been married to an Italian
woman while in the United States and that they divorced. She said he
was engaged to an American woman when he defected.

<TEXT>
   A pet cat attacked an 8-year-old girl
several times and drove her family from their home, ``making all
kinds of weird sounds,'' until it finally was wrestled to the ground
by two men and killed.
   The body of 3-year-old Gypsy was sent to a state laboratory for
rabies testing.
   ``I've watched all kinds of movies and I've never seen anything
like this,'' Mike Johnson said of the cat's last attack on his
daughter, Amy. ``The cat was ripping her apart all over.''
   Gypsy attacked Amy several times Monday and finally drove the
family from the house for several hours.
   When the family returned home, Johnson persuaded Amy to take a
shower, thinking that perhaps she had picked up the scent of other
cats.
   But when the girl entered her bedroom, Gypsy reappeared, glared
at Johnson and then pounced on Amy, clawing a one-inch gash above
her right eye that required four stitches.
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' Amy said. ``It felt like 150
needles going through me.''
   Johnson rescued his daughter by striking the cat with a mop
handle, then called police while Amy's mother, Dorothy, took her to
a hospital.
   After Patrolman Gary Berg arrived, he and Johnson found the cat
under Amy's bed.
   ``She came flying out, making all kinds of weird sounds,''
Johnson said.
   The cat bit and scratched, but the men managed to wrestle her to
the floor. Johnson said he finally was forced to strangle the animal.
   ``I was tired and the cat was freaking out and both of us were
getting sliced and diced,'' Johnson said. ``If was afraid if I let
her go she would kill me.
   ``She had an evil look on her face.''
   Mrs. Johnson said Gypsy had been with the family since she was a
kitten and was never mistreated or deprived of food. Johnson said
the cat never had a rabies shot, but was an indoor cat and therefore
unlikely to catch the disease.
   Dr. Philip Haines of the state Department of Human Services
laboratory in Augusta acknowledged that the likelihood of an indoor
cat contracting rabies was slim, but said there could be many
reasons why a cat would go berserk.

<HEAD>Police Officers Sue Over Urinal Spying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of current and former police
employees has filed a $30 million lawsuit against the city of
Concord because a video camera was secretly placed in the police
station men's room.
   The department installed a hidden video camera above a urinal in
1986, hoping to identify the person who clogged it several times
with toilet paper.
   Chief George Straka has called the surveillance ``bad judgment''
and said no one ever viewed the tapes.
   The overflow reportedly flooded a computer room and the chief's
office on the floor below the restroom, which was open to the public
but used primarily by police.
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, accuses Straka
and three commanders of invading the plaintiffs' privacy. It asks
that the city pay $1 million each to 26 officers and three civilian
employees who allegedly were watched by police cadets and filmed as
they stood at urinals.
   The lawsuit also accuses the chief and his top commanders of
making death threats to one officer, Gary Primavera, the day after
Primavera filed a claim against the city in the case. The suit asks
that he be awarded an additional $1 million for the alleged threats.
   The Tribune in Oakland reported in Wednesday's editions that
Straka, Captains Bob Evans and Wayne Novinger have been ordered
suspended without pay for at least three weeks as a result of the
video camera incident.
   The disciplinary action was discussed at a squad briefing, the
paper said.
   City Attorney Kenneth Scheidig refused to confirm the
disciplinary action, saying the results of the investigation are
personnel matters and not subject to public disclosure. Concord is
about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco.

<HEAD>NASA Spending Benefits States, Study Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NASA spending next year will create 237,000
private-industry jobs and spur $23 billion in private-industry
sales, according to a study commissioned by a group of former NASA
employees.
   The NASA Alumni League said the study by Management Information
Services Inc. is the first comprehensive look at the state-by-state
industry and job effects of space agency purchasing.
   California, with its huge aerospace industry, is the biggest
benefactor, expected to garner $6.7 billion in sales and 70,332
non-government jobs created directly or indirectly by NASA-related
spending, the study found. That's nearly 30 percent of the U.S.
total in both categories.
   But the study also indicates that states not usually tied to the
space industry benefit. New Jersey, for example, can expect $506
million in sales and 5,411 jobs, the report said.
   The study was based on an estimate that the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration will spend $11.3 billion in fiscal 1990,
which begins Oct. 1. NASA has asked for a budget of more than $13
billion, but that probably will be cut by appropriations committees
studying the request.
   ``NASA procurement spending in 1990 will create 237,000 private
sector jobs, $23 billion in private industry sales and $2.4 billion
in corporate profits,'' the study said.
   Spending on that level also will generate $7.4 billion in
federal, state and local tax revenues.
   Florida, Alabama, Maryland and Texas, all with major NASA
facilities, also lead in the sales and jobs category.
   Texas would have $2.1 billion in sales and 19,528 non-government
employees from the NASA spending, while Florida would have $1.3
billion in sales and 14,756 jobs, according to the study.
   Maryland would have $994 million in sales and 11,122 jobs, while
Alabama would have $858 million in sales and 8,582 jobs.
   The report also computed the indirect impact of NASA procurement
on various states.
   Michigan, for example, would receive $14 indirectly from
procurement-induced funds for every dollar the state receives in
NASA money.
   Other states with large benefit ratios were: Indiana $12 for
every $1 in NASA funds; Illinois 9.8 to 1; Missouri 8.3 to 1; and
Oregon 6.7 to 1.
   The study provided these estimated sales and job figures:
   Alaska $35 million in sales, 236 jobs; Arizona $229 million,
2,424; Arkansas $89 million, 876; Colorado $490 million, 5,381;
Connecticut $601 million, 6,224; Delaware $32 million, 291; District
of Columbia $75 million, 990; Georgia $299 million, 3,224;
   Hawaii $23 million, 278; Idaho $21 million, 242; Illinois $549
million, 5,657; Indiana $348 million, 3,253; Iowa $94 million,

   The pilot and captain of a tanker that
spilled more 310,000 gallons of oil in the Delaware River said today
an anchor was dropped too soon, causing the vessel to swing around
and run aground on the shoals.
   In Rhode Island, a grand jury was convened today to investigate a
420,000-gallon oil spill, and the cleanup of 250,000 gallons of
crude in Texas was nearly over.
   The spills occcured within hours of each other over the weekend.
   Capt Raul Dibarrart, testifying at a Coast Guard inquiry in
Philadelphia, said the crew of the Uruguayan tanker was lowering the
anchor to the water's surface in preparation for dropping anchor
farther up the Delaware River shipping channel.
   ``I heard the anchor fall, and I heard over the walkie-talkie my
lieutenant say `It's running away,''' the captain said, speaking
through an intepreter.
   The captain and the tanker pilot, Robert Anderson, said the
vessel swung around and ran aground in the shallows, then ran
aground again as two tugboats tried to bring it back into deep water
and set it back on course.
   It was then that a tugboat captain noticed oil coming from the
tanker, the pilot said.
   Paul L. Ives Jr., president of the Pilots Association for the Bay
and River Delaware, said before the hearing got under way that
dropping the anchor from 749-foot vessel is ``like stepping on the
leash of a running dog.''
   Meanwhile, a Coast Guard spokesman said more people and boats
were being pressed into service today to clean up the heavy
industrial heating oil, which was mostly congealed in huge blobs
that could be picked up by hand.
   Temperatures in the mid-90s Tuesday made the oil run in spots,
complicating the cleanup and raising the threat to the shore and to
wildlife, but Coast Guard spokesman Jim Weakley said today's weather
was cooler and the spill is ``winding down.''
   ``It's winding down because we're getting the stuff out of the
water,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, New Jersey officials said a wind shift was sending oil
toward their side of the river. crews were cleaning up the debris as
it came ashore, said Tom Gallagher, spokesman for the state's
emergency response agency.
   Coast Guard spokeswoman Annette Sebastian said 600 people and 33
boats worked on the cleanup Tuesday and more were expected today.
Officials dramatically reduced their estimate of the amount of oil
spilled, from 800,000 gallons to about 310,000. An estimated 106,240
gallons had been recovered by Tuesday night.
   In Rhode Island, the effort to fix blame for Friday's tanker
accident shifted to a state grand jury. Some of the crew and the
captain, Iakovas Georgudis, have been summoned.
   The state is investigating whether a harbor pilot was required to
be on board the World Prodigy when it ran aground, spilling 420,000
gallons of heating oil at the mouth of Narragansett Bay.
   In interviews with Coast Guard officials and the governor after
the spill, Georgudis admitted he made a mistake in not taking on a
pilot to take the vessel into the harbor.
   The Coast Guard wants prosecutors to grant a helmsman immunity
from prosecution to secure his testimony. Helmsman Konstadinos A.
Paraskevopulos, accompanied by an attorney and speaking through an
interpreter, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and refused to testify Tuesday at the Coast Guard
inquiry.
   Virtually all the spilled No. 2 heating oil had dispersed, and
officials said a rainstorm forecast for this afternoon would help
flush the oil out of the sand and break up a sheen in the water.
   In Houston, the pilot of a tanker that collided with a barge in
the Houston Ship Channel radioed he couldn't stop his vessel minutes
before the accident, according to the captain of a tugboat pushing
the barge.
   Mason T. Ware testified at a Coast Guard inquiry that he realized
he wouldn't be able to stop his tugboat and three barges it was
pushing.
   Friday night's collision damaged one of the barges, which leaked
about 250,000 gallons of crude into the water and fouled a mile-long
stretch of the Galveston Bay shoreline.
   Crews this morning continued the cleanup near La Porte, where
most of the slick was contained within a ship channel, and all but
about 20,000 gallons have been removed, Coast Guard spokesman Bob
Morehead said.
   The tanker pilot, Michael Gale, testified Tuesday that his vessel
failed to perform as expected on a right turn into the channel,
leading to the collision.
   In Delaware, the state filed suit in federal court against the
government of Uruguay and the captain of the Presidente Rivera,
seeking unspecified damages caused when the government-owned tanker
ran aground Saturday.
   The spill covered 21 miles Tuesday, extending from above Marcus
Hook, Pa., to below Pea Patch Island. The island is the site of a
wildlife refuge, which was being protected by booms.

<HEAD>Leading Economic Indicators Take Deepest Dip Since Market Crash of
1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported Wednesday that its
chief economic forecasting gauge plunged last month, taking the
deepest dip since the 1987 stock market crash. But many analysts
remained confident the economy is not being steered into a recession.
   The 1.2 percent decline in the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators was the steepest since a 1.8 percent dropoff in November
l987, the Commerce Department reported. The drop in 1987 reflected
the shock from the 508-point plunge in the Dow Jones index of 30
industrial stocks on Oct. 19, 1987.
   Many analysts were expecting a decline _ although perhaps not as
steep _ and said it was consistent with the so-called soft landing
sought by the Federal Reserve as it seeks to stem inflation by
slowing the economy without driving it into recession.
   The index is designed to foretell economic activity six to nine
months into the future.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of the drop:
``The economy is healthy and growing at a slower pace, which means
less pressure on inflation and interest rates. We still think that
the economy is in very good shape.''
   Undersecretary of Commerce Michael R. Darby told reporters: ``I
think the Federal Reserve has been aiming at more moderate growth
and it has been successful in achieving that this spring.''
   Other economists agreed.
   ``Although the numbers came in a bit lower than expected, I still
think the Fed is on track for a soft landing,'' said David Wyss,
senior financial economist of Data Resources Inc., in Lexington,
Mass.
   However, analysts such as Wyss and Lawrence Chimerine, senior
economic adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., also
expressed concern that the Fed not overtighten its grip on the
economy.
   ``While again I think we'll avoid a recession, certainly we'll
have to watch the next couple of months very carefully,'' Chimerine
said.
   There have been signs recently that the Fed has been easing
interest rates, and some economists anticipate further easing as the
economy continues to slow.
   ``I don't expect a discount rate cut,'' Wyss said, ``but I do
expect to see interest rates moving down further due to other Fed
action. The slower economic growth is getting impressive enough that
they will want to loosen again.''
   The May decline was the third in four months. The index fell 0.3
percent in February and 0.6 percent in March but rose 0.6 percent in
April, thus allowing the index to steer clear of the traditional
signal of a forthcoming recession _ three consecutive monthly
declines.
   While a three-month drop has preceded all eight recessions since
1948, there also have been five similar series of declines _
including the five consecutive months surrounding the 1987 stock
market crash _ that were not followed by recessions.
   Only two of the forward-looking business statistics that make up
the composite index moved up in May: higher stock prices and
increased building permits.
   The others moved down: a drop in the money supply; lower prices
for sensitive materials, indicating slower demand; the fourth
consecutive drop in an index measuring consumer confidence; faster
vendor deliveries, meaning declining demand; a shorter average work
week; fewer orders for plants and equipment; a decrease in
manufacturers' unfilled orders; higher initial claims for jobless
benefits; and a decrease in manufacturers' new orders.
   The various changes left the index at 143.8 percent of its 1982
base of 100. So far this year, the index has declined at an annual
rate of 2 percent, compared with an increase of 4.5 percent for all
of 1988.

   A state appeals court today refused to disturb
a judge's order temporarily preventing the commissioner of baseball
from holding a disciplinary hearing on charges Pete Rose bet on his
own team's games.
   The ruling was the second court loss in four days for
Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti.
   On Sunday, Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel granted Rose a
14-day temporary restraining order blocking the hearing. Nadel said
that Giamatti had already made up his mind against Rose and could
not give him a fair hearing.
   Baseball's lawyers asked an Ohio appeals court to nullify the
order, arguing it interferes with the commissioner's powers to
protect the integrity of the game.
   But a three-judge appellate panel this afternoon said it has no
authority to review a temporary restraining order.
   Baseball's lawyers could not be immediately reached for comment
on whether they would pursue their appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.
   Rose is accused of gambling on his own team _ an offense that
could get him banned from the game for life.
   The allegations against the Cincinnati Reds manager are in a
225-page report by chief baseball investigator John M. Dowd and
eight accompanying volumes of evidence.
   Among other things, the report contains statements by a former
Rose associate that Rose conferred with other baseball managers
before deciding whether to bet on their teams and tried to get
involved in cocaine deals.
   The drug accusations against Rose were made in February by Paul
Janszen, a bodybuilder who recently completed a four-month stay in a
halfway house for failing to report income from the sale of steroids
on his taxes. He said Rose tried to get involved in the cocaine
deals of his other associates.
   It was the first time Rose has been publicly linked to drugs by
testimony in the investigation, which was announced March 20. The
report was released Monday.
   Janszen didn't say Rose used drugs, but said the manager thought
he could get cash from drug deals conducted by a circle of
associates. Rose sometimes had trouble paying his large gambling
debts, according to Janszen.
   Several of the associates were sentenced after federal
authorities cracked a ring that transported cocaine from Florida to
Ohio.
   Janszen said he traveled with Rose on road trips in April, May
and June 1987, and spent a lot of time in the Reds' clubhouse. He
said he saw Rose research games before he bet on them.
   ``When I was with him all day long,'' Janszen said, ``he could
sit in the clubhouse and, depending on what city it was _ he didn't
like to do it in New York because he said New York's phones were
being tapped and he was under investigation up there for gambling.
   ``But there is different cities that he knew the phones were
safe. And he would call up different managers and ask them how
certain pitchers' arms were and if they were going to play certain
players that night, and try to get as much information as he could
about a game so then he could go ahead and either bet the game or
not bet the game.''
   Janszen said he wouldn't ``swear to this,'' but he thought Rose
called Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson once for information on
pitcher Jack Morris' physical condition. Anderson managed Rose
during Cincinnati's ``Big Red Machine'' era of the 1970s.
   Anderson declined to comment Tuesday in Detroit about anything
related to the Rose investigation.
   Other managers scoffed at the accusation that Rose made telephone
calls to get information for bets.
   ``I think it's absurd,'' Minnesota's Tom Kelly said. ``I wouldn't
dignify that with a comment.''
   Rose's attempts to get tips weren't limited to managers, Janszen
said, adding that in spring 1987 Rose placed bets on college
basketball.
   ``What he would do is he would get down to the spring training
facility (then in Tampa, Fla.) and talk to some of the other guys
and figure out who they liked. Maybe run into a sportswriter, you
know: `Who do you like tonight?' Then, he would call and you see
that's how it worked,'' Janszen said. ``He kept losing.''
   Later in the year, Janszen said he placed bets for Rose on Reds'
games and other baseball games. He said Rose didn't bet against the
Reds.
   Janszen said Rose got heavily into debt with a New York bookie.
   ``And when they had to go to New York and play a baseball game,
he was scared to death to go up there because he was afraid they
would come into the clubhouse,'' Janszen said. ``But they never
did.''
   Janszen said Rose wasn't always careful to hide his gambling.
   ``He would talk about his gambling in front of a lot of people,''
Janszen said.
   ``He put himself above everything. They can't get me, what have
they got, what are they going to prove, how are they going to prove
it.''
   Rose may have bigger problems than baseball, for Dowd's report
also says he conspired to hide his racetrack winnings from a $47,646
Pik-Six ticket in 1987.
   If the charges are true, Rose faces possible charges of
conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. A federal grand jury is
investigating Rose's income taxes.

<HEAD>Flag-Burning Amendment Would Bring Censorship, Critics Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Free-speech advocates, reacting strongly to a
proposal by President Bush, said Wednesday a constitutional
amendment to protect the American flag inevitably would lead to
censorship of many unpopular views.
   ``The minute you establish the principle that there can be
exceptions to the First Amendment for offensive speech, there's no
principled way to limit it,'' said Ira Glasser, executive director
of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``The first exception will not be the last,'' he said. ``Someone
adds an exception for derogatory racial remarks. If you're a woman
you want an exception for Playboy. If you're a Jew you want an
exception for Nazis marching. Pretty soon, you don't have a First
Amendment.''
   The president's call for an amendment on Tuesday was sparked by
the Supreme Court's ruling last week that burning the flag is a
constitutionally protected form of political protest.
   Bush didn't say just how his proposed amendment would read, but
he did call the flag a ``unique symbol'' of America, suggesting he
believes the Constitution can be amended to outlaw flag burning
without unduly threatening the right to protest.
   His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, underlined that idea Wednesday,
saying, ``The president does not believe this amendment would cause
an unraveling of the Constitution.''
   Burton Yale Pines of the Heritage Foundation supported Bush,
saying, ``This is no frivolous exercise, no slippery slope down
which a host of democratic guarantees may slide. The amending
process would permit a national debate and referendum on the flag.''
   But the ACLU's Glasser disagrees.
   ``I think it's impossible to draft limiting language,'' he said.
``Would it say flag burning or flag desecration? Would desecration
include wearing the flag, or superimposing a dove on it, or failing
to salute it?''
   Flag amendments already pending in Congress generally would give
the federal government and the states authority to prohibit
desecration of the flag and to impose criminal penalties for such
actions.
   One introduced by Sen. Strom Thurmond, ranking Republican on the
Senate Judiciary Committee, does not mention criminal penalties, but
says:
   ``The Congress of the United States and the states have the power
to prohibit the desecrating, mutilating, defacing, defiling or
burning of the flag of the United States.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the courts still would have
a role in interpreting any amendment.
   ``If the constitutional amendment is passed, it will obviously
require some implementing legislation at both the federal and state
level if the Congress and state legislators want to follow through
on it effectively, and the terms of that legislation would then be
subject to construction in the courts,'' Thornburgh said.
   Amending the Constitution is no easy matter. An amendment
beginning in Congress must be approved by two-thirds of the House
and Senate, and by 38 state legislatures.
   Floyd Abrams, a lawyer who has represented the news media in
numerous free-speech cases, said, ``Never before in our history have
we limited what the Supreme Court has held to be the First Amendment
rights of Americans.''
   He said President Bush's call for a constitutional amendment
represents ``a dangerous precedent,'' adding, ``I believe a good
part of the impetus for it is demagogic in nature.''
   The constitutional right to burn the American flag, as seen by
the court, is not absolute. It does not protect those who burn
someone else's flag, or those who while burning a flag trespass,
disturb the peace or create a safety hazard.
   Abrams said, ``The Constitution was drafted for the ages. There's
no way a flag-desecration amendment could be drafted for the ages.''

<HEAD>Government, Tamil Tigers Declare Cease-fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and the biggest group of
Tamil rebels agreed to an immediate cease-fire in a six-year war
that has claimed 9,000 lives, the two sides said Wednesday.
   On Sri Lanka's second war front Wednesday, police said Sinhalese
extremists detonated a car bomb in the southern provincial capital,
killing four people and wounding 25 others.
   Industries Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe announced the government
and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam reached agreement Tuesday.
   The two sides will resolve Tamil demands for an independent
nation and other differences through negotiations, Wickremasinghe
said at a news conference.
   It was not attended by any Tamil leader. But a rebel source said
the cease-fire does not mean they have abandoned their campaign for
a separate homeland in the northeast.
   ``The LTTE has clearly told the government that it is premature
to talk about the withdrawal of the (homeland) demand,'' the source
said on condition of anonymity.
   The truce follows a unilateral cease-fire announced by the Tigers
on May 4 when they began their first peace talks with the government.
   Rebels want a separate nation for the ethnic minority Tamils
because they say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese who
comprise 75 percent of the population. Tamils are mainly Hindu while
most Sinhalese are Buddhist.
   Most war victims have been government soldiers and Sinhalese
civilians killed by rebels in the north and east, where Tamils
predominate.
   Confrontations between the rebels and government troops reduced
considerably after India brokered a July 29, 1987, peace accord.
   It confined the Sri Lankan military in the north and east to
barracks and replaced them with Indian peacekeeping troops.
   The accord says rebels should surrender their arms in exchange
for local political powers for the Tamils who make up 18 percent of
Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   The Tigers initially accepted the accord, as did other smaller
Tamil rebel groups. But then the Tigers turned their guns on Indian
soldiers. At least 800 Indian troops and 1,500 Tamils have been
killed.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa has asked India to withdraw its
45,000 troops by the second anniversary of the accord, but New Delhi
says a hasty withdrawal could cause even greater violence.
   India got involved because its own 60 million Tamils sympathize
with the Sri Lankan rebels' cause.
   Wednesday's cease-fire offers peace for the north and east. But
the government still is fighting a southern insurgency against
ultranationalist Sinhalese angered by the Indian troop presence and
government concessions to Tamils.
   Extremists of the left-wing Sinhalese People's Liberation Front
have killed more than 3,500 government officials, supporters and
governing party members in the last two years, by official count.
   Front guerrillas Wednesday detonated a car bomb outside a local
government building in Galle were 50 councilors were meeting, a
senior police official said in a telephone interview.
   It killed four people, the officer said without identifying the
victims.
   Galle, 70 miles south of Colombo, is headquarters of the southern
province.

   Barefoot Princess Diana lost a photo-finish race
for mothers at the annual school sports day of her 7-year-old son,
Prince William.
   The 27-year-old princess flung out her arms as she sprinted
across the tape at the Weatherby School sports day at Richmond
Athletics Ground on Tuesday but another mother got there a step
ahead.
   The princess, who won the mother's race last year, watched in
delight as William won the Form 3 Goldrush, a race that involves
balancing two tinfoil nuggets on a tennis racket. Earlier, William
had finished last in the 60-meter dash.
   Prince Charles did not fare as well as his wife or son. He had
trouble tying a plastic bag on one foot in the fathers' event and
only managed to come in sixth from last among the 35 competitors.

   Donald Trump, complaining his 292-foot yacht
isn't spacious enough for his guests, says he's trading in the Trump
Princess for a bigger and, of course, more expensive boat.
   Trump told New York Newsday he was looking for ``something in
excess of 400 feet long, closer to 500 feet.'' The New York Post
reported the same thing, with both estimating the new craft will run
Trump about $140 million.
   Trump was in a meeting Wednesday and couldn't provide details,
but sent word through his office that the reports were accurate.
   The added space is not needed by him, wife Ivana or their
children, Trump said _ it's because guests from his Atlantic City
casinos all want to visit the yacht.
   ``All of the high rollers in Atlantic City, they love it,'' he
said.
   The Trump Princess has 210 phones, 11 suites, six decks, three
elevators, a helipad and a disco. The new boat will have all that
and more, Trump said. An Olympic-size pool is one addition under
consideration, a source told the Post.
   Trump bought the Princess for $29 million from the Sultan of
Brunei in 1987.

   ``It's important to cry out when you feel there is suffering.
Music can be a more universal way than waving a flag or carrying a

   Tickets to the event Tuesday sold for $35 to $100. The amount

   In the early 1940s, jazz clubs in New York such
as Minton's were the scenes of some extraordinary jam sessions.
These musical gymnastics shaped the American art form to a classic
style that became known as bebop.
   Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie was one of the masterminds of bop. And
so it was fitting that he should lead a ``Bebop Revisited'' concert
Tuesday night at the JVC Jazz Festival.
   Bebop prospered under Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, who led the
house band at Minton's. Soon, pianist-composer Thelonious Monk and
alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, who also composed, refined the
musical style to pretty much what it is today.
   Some of Parker's old bandmates played at the Tuesday night
concert at Avery Fisher Hall, including pianist Duke Jordan, with
Parker in 1947-48; and trumpet player Red Rodney, one of the first
white musicians to understand bebop, who played with the Charlie
Parker Quintet from 1949-51.
   Jordan and Rodney joined Phil Woods on sax and Mel Lewis on drums
in the evening's first set, which featured outstanding solo work on
some bebop standards. Jordan's fingering was light and lovely on
``Don't Blame Me.'' Woods sweetly soared with ``Lover Man.'' And
Rodney was in good form with ``I Can't Get Started.''
   Gillespie joined in for a final blast with the group.
   The next set brought the dueling pianos of Barry Harris and
Walter Davis Jr. Joining them were Ron Carter on bass and Roy
Haynes, who played with the Parker Quintet in 1949-50, on drums. It
was an energetic set that ended with an explosive version of ``How
High the Moon.''
   The second half of the evening opened with vibes king Milt
Jackson, who has worked with Gillespie, Monk, Parker and the
legendary Modern Jazz Quartet. Jackson was joined by Bob Cranshaw on
bass, Cedar Walton on piano, Mickey Roker on drums and Jimmy Heath
on tenor sax. Gillespie joined in for a jam or two.
   The group excelled with Monk's lilting ``Round Midnight.''
   Unfortunately, bad miking made Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers
a poor closing act. Avery Fisher has excellent acoustics, but some
groups tend to over-mike. Blakey's drums were so loud no other
instrument in his eight-piece group could be heard _ and that
included a trombone, three saxophones and a trumpet!
   By the time the group finished the set with ``A Night in
Tunisia,'' the amplification had been adjusted and listeners
realized the collection of talent Blakey had assembled.
   Blakey's Jazz Messengers has been a proving ground for some of
the brightest talent in jazz. The personnel who've played in the
group reads like a who's who: Horace Silver, Wynton Marsalis,
Branford Marsalis, Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan, Freddie Hubbard, Woody
Shaw, Chick Corea, Jackie McLean and Cedar Walton.
   Ed Bradley of CBS' ``60 Minutes'' served as host for the night.
Before becoming a TV journalist, Bradley was a jazz deejay in
Philadelphia. The concert was a benefit for the Studio Museum in
Harlem.
   The JVC Jazz Festival is sponsored by the Japanese Victor Corp.,
an electronics firm.

<HEAD>School Board Approves $50 Million in Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debt-ridden Detroit School Board voted to cut
$50 million from the budget, lay off 900 teachers and 700 other
employees and eliminate some varsity sports unless the voters
approve a tax increase.
   Over jeers and shouts from more than 350 parents and teachers,
the board voted 7-2 Tuesday to approve a 1989-90 budget of more than
$700 million.
   The cuts were made to avoid intervention by the state, which has
threatened to impose its own reductions. Retiring Superintendent
Arthur Jefferson said the district will be $151 million in the red
by the end of the fiscal year in October.
   The layoffs would affect one out of 10 teachers and 455 janitors,
nearly half the maintenance staff. Some varsity sports and driver
education would be cut, and six administrative offices and five
schools would be closed.
   ``This budget is killing our kids and it is killing our school
district,'' said parent Delores Smith. ``For a long time I was
afraid of a state takeover of our schools, but now I see the enemy's
the board.''
   No specific tax increase or election date for such an increase
has been set.

<HEAD>Principal Offers To Give Up His Own Job Rather Than Fire Teachers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A principal has offered to sacrifice his
own job so that teachers won't have to be fired from their
financially pressed elementary school of 200 students.
   Principal Norman Najimy told the Richmond School Committee on
Tuesday it could help balance the books ``with the least damage to
the children'' by firing him and applying his pay of $43,000 a year
toward teachers' salaries. He said the committee could pay a teacher
an extra $3,000 to run the school.
   ``This kind of catastrophic financial situation forces a man to
creatively destroy his school system,'' George St. Pierre, regional
superintendent for Richmond and several other small districts, said
Wednesday. ``That's what Norm is doing.''
   Najimy, who was not in his office Wednesday, also submitted a
list of 22 other possible moves, ranging from cutbacks in phsyical
education programs to boosting the price of school lunches in order
to trim $150,000 from the school's proposed $1.2 million budget for
the upcoming fiscal year.
   He argued against laying off any teachers.
   ``Building faculty is the hardest thing to do,'' Najimy told the
committee. ``If we lose our teachers, we will never get them back.''
   St. Pierre said the school has the equivalent of 14 full-time
teachers, including some part-time instructors teaching subjects
such as art and music.
   ``He's a very sincere person and I sincerely believe that Norm
wants to do what he thinks is best for the kids,'' St. Pierre said.
   ``It's a small school in a small town with limited financial
resources and the severe financial problems are due to things we
have no control over,'' St. Pierre said.
   The school committee is scheduled to consider the cuts at its
July 13 meeting. Richmond is a town of 1,600 in the Berkshire Hills
in western Massachusetts.

   Chinese media are giving prominent coverage to
accounts that oppose the official line on the June 3-4 crackdown,
but they also denounce the contrary reports.
   The government says the crackdown by thousands of troops marching
on Beijing was necessary to crush a small group seeking to overthrow
the leadership.
   The most recent example of reporting anti-government views and
then dismissing them came Wednesday in the newspaper Economic
Reference, which told of a Shanghai man who said the bloodstains on
his shirt came from Tiananmen Square, where he said 26,000 people
were killed.
   Geng Xiuliang told people on a street corner in Shanghai on June
5 that he saw a 3-year-old boy shot six times when soldiers backed
by tanks drove student protesters and their supporters from the
square.
   Geng, a 36-year-old worker at a metal factory, tried to sell the
shirt as a ``historic object'' for the equivalent of about $13.50,
the newspaper said.
   Police stopped Geng, who admitted he was not at Tiananmen on June
3-4, but with a friend in Shanghai where they killed a dog and ate
it for supper, the newspaper said.
   It quoted Geng as saying the bloodstains actually came from the
dog. The paper did not say whether Geng was punished.
   In another case, the magazine Beijing Review this week gave
astonishingly prominent play to anti-government posters put up at
Chinese universities early on in the seven weeks of student-led
demonstrations.
   ``Is there any reason for the existence of socialism?'' asked
one. Another declared: ``Right from the beginning, everything the
Communist Party has done is corrupt, autocratic and traitorous. The
Communist Party has nothing good.'' The magazine published excerpts
from posters that described the party as ``just another group of
autocrats in power in China's thousand-year-old feudal despotism,''
and said it was ``rampant with profiteering officials, full of
corruption and degeneration and collapsing morality.''
   But the point of reproducing the posters, the Beijing Review
said, was to show how a ``few people stir up turmoil by making use
of all the well-meaning aspirations of the broad masses of students,
by making use of the same people's confused thinking, by making use
of some failings in the work of the party and government.''
   One of the best-known instances of authorities publicizing
anti-government views is the case involving video footage
intercepted from the ABC News.
   Shown across China, the tape shows a man animatedly describing
how 20,000 people were shot and crushed to death in the army's
attack on Tiananmen Square.
   News announcers urged the public to report the ``rumormonger'' to
police, and within 24 hours the man had been spotted and turned in
to authorities in Dalian, a coastal city east of Beijing.
   The government says fewer than 300 people, half of them soldiers,
were killed when the army marched on Beijing. Chinese witnesses and
Western intelligence reports say up to 3,000 people, most civilians,
died.
   State-controlled media have singled out the Voice of America for
allegedly spreading rumors and interfering in China's politics by
broadcasting reports Beijing considers inflammatory.
   The Chinese media have noted the VOA quoted Taiwan news reports
that senior leader Deng Xiaoping had died or was seriously ill, and
that civil war was imminent in the days after the crackdown began.
   Many news organizations reported that apparent infighting within
the military indicated civil war was possible, but Chinese criticism
was directed at the VOA.
   ``If the VOA reports aren't rumormongering, then what is?'' a
Radio Beijing news announcer said.

   The Canadian Museum of Civilization opens Thursday
on the banks of the Ottawa River, giving Canada an extravagant
combination of high-tech and culture aimed at luring more visitors
to the national capital.
   The government invested $214 million in the museum, which forms
an impressive triangle of national landmarks. Parliament Hill is
visible from the glassed-in Grand Hall of the museum. On the Ontario
side of the river is the National Gallery of Art.
   The 24-acre museum has two separate structures, a Glacier Wing
for exhibition space and a Canadian Shield Wing for storage and
administration.
   Architect Douglas Cardinal said one of his goals was to make the
vividly curved building appear as if it were carved by the glaciers
``and all the forces of nature.''
   For years, a debate has gone on in Canada over what constitutes
the country's national identity and whether anything more complex
than a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer can legitimately be
called a national symbol.
   As such, virtually every aspect of the museum can figure in the
quest for a national identity.
   The museum houses a major collection of Pacific Coast Indian
totem poles, native art and artifacts and wiring for its high-tech
systems that could circle the globe 18 times.
   Museum director George MacDonald likes to speak of the museum as
being of the ``global village,'' the term the late Canadian media
analyst Marshall McLuhan used to describe the world as a single
community formed as a result of mass media, rapid travel and other
developments.
   The museum's technological systems have been described as
symbolic of the importance of communications in developing a vast
but sparsely populated country of 26 million people.
   The museum will be able to tie into communications systems
elsewhere and use the technology for research and educational
purposes as well as its own exhibitions.
   There have been complaints the cost was excessive at a time of
budgetary restraints and that the new museum is as much a theme park
as a cultural center.
   MacDonald said the cost, said to be more than triple the original
budget, actually was within 30 percent of the target.
   Perhaps most like a theme park is the History Hall, where
visitors can pass through exhibits showing the settlement of Canada
from whaling in the 16th century to mining in the West.
   Costumed actors will roam through the sections, with buildings
and other props, to dramatize past and present ways of life.
   Only 45 percent of the exhibitions planned for the more than 1
million square feet of space were ready for opening day.
   The rest will open gradually in the next few years.

   Christian and Moslem leaders Wednesday
supported an Arab League call for a cease-fire, but Syrian and
Lebanese Christian gunners continued to trade shellfire that killed
two people.
   Police said 11 people were wounded by the rocket and artillery
shells that exploded on both sides of the Green Line slicing Beirut
into Christian and Moslem sectors.
   By police count, 375 people have been killed and 1,471 wounded
since March 8, when the duel began between Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly
Christian Lebanese army and Syrian soldiers allied with Lebanese
Druse militiamen.
   The Arab League's special committee on Lebanon called for both
sides to lift port blockades that started the fighting.
   The committee grouping Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid, King
Hassan II of Morocco, and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd issued its latest
appeal after a Tuesday meeting in Oran, Algeria. Beirut radio
stations aired the call several times as fighting raged Wednesday.
   An Arab summit gave the committee six months to negotiate a
settlement to Lebanon's 14-year civil war, but it has not been able
to enforce even a truce.
   ``We stress that for the initiation of dialogue resulting in
benefits for the Lebanese and Lebanon, violence in all its forms
must stop,'' said the three leaders' statement.
   The daily As-Safir, which supports Syria, said Lakhdar Ibrahimi,
Arab League assistant secretary-general, will come to Lebanon within
48 hours in a new drive to stop the fighting.
   Committee leaders said their foreign ministers will hold talks
with world leaders to promote peace. Syria is the chief power broker
in Lebanon while Aoun is armed by Iraq, Damascus' chief Arab foe.
   Following the contacts and a consolidated cease-fire, the
committee said it will invite Lebanon's single-chamber parliament to
a foreign country of legislators' choice to work out a new
power-sharing formula. Christian sects traditionally have dominated
Lebanese politics, though they are outnumbered 2-1 by Sunni and
Shiite Moslems and the minority Druse.
   ``The cease-fire, lifting of blockades and opening of crossing
links must be achieved before the meeting of the parliamentarians
outside Lebanon, which will set the stage for the meeting of the
Lebanese parliament in Lebanon,'' the committee said.
   Christian legislators welcomed the calls for a cease-fire and
lifting of blockades, but voiced reservations about meeting in a
foreign country.
   Phalangist Party leader George Saadeh, head of a right-wing
Christian coalition, said: ``If crossing gateways were reopened, the
Lebanese would be able to meet in Lebanon.'' Gates linking Beirut's
Christian enclave to Syrian-policed Moslem sectors have been blocked
for more than three months.
   Syria's 40,000 troops and allied forces started besieging the
Christian area northeast of Beirut on March 14, six days after Aoun
blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias.
   The conservative daily newspaper Ad-Diyar, which is close to
Aoun, said the Maronite Catholic leader opposes a parliament session
outside Lebanon because ``it contradicts the principles of
sovereignty and national dignity.''
   Lebanon's parliament has not met for more than a year, since it
failed to elect a leader to succeed President Amin Gemayel when his
term expired.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, whose Moslem Cabinet competes
with Aoun's Christian one, expressed support for the Arab committee.
   ``We declare our full respect to the decisions of the tripartite
committee. We also declare our full readiness to cooperate with the
committee,'' Hoss said.
   Roman Catholic legislator Shafik Badr said: ``We support the
decisions of the Oran meeting ... but the issue is to apply these
decisions.''

<HEAD>1 Million Serbs Cheer Their Nationalist Leader in Kosovo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1 million Serbs gathered
Wednesday in Kosovo, an ancient Serbian heartland now dominated by
ethnic Albanians, to mark the 600th anniversary of a great battle
and cheer their nationalist leader.
   Chants of ``Slobo! Slobo!'' arose when Slobodan Milosevic,
president of the Serbian republic, ascended a platform high above
the flag-waving sea of admirers.
   Serbs came from all parts of Yugoslavia and from abroad to bask
in the nationalism Milosevic has revived through his campaign to
regain control over Kosovo, an autonomous province within Serbia.
   ``Kosovo is Serbia!'' they chanted.
   Kosovo was the heart of medieval Serbia, where the Serbs were
defeated by the Ottoman Turks in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. The
defeat entered legend as the beginning of a five-century struggle by
the Serbs to keep their Orthodox Christian faith alive under Moslem
rule.
   Milosevic told the crowed Wednesday it was ``very difficult to
say today whether the Battle of Kosovo was a Serbian defeat or
victory, whether we lost our freedom and became slaves ... or we
managed to survive in spite of slavery.''
   ``Six centuries ago, Serbia defended itself bravely in the field
of Kosovo, but Serbia was also defending Europe,'' he said. ``It was
a bulwark defending the European culture, civilization and
religion.''
   Today, Serbs are a small minority in Kosovo and claim they are
harassed by the predominantly Moslem ethnic Albanians who make up 85
percent of the 1.9 million people. The impoverished southern
province adjoins Albania.
   Ethnic tension turned violent in March, with fights between
police and Albanians protesting moves by Serbia to take control of
the provincial police, judiciary and schools.
   At least 25 people were killed and hundreds of ethnic Albanians
have been jailed.
   On Wednesday, ethnic Albanians stayed out of sight during the
largest outpouring of Serbian nationalism in more than four decades
of Communist rule. The day began with religious ceremonies at one of
Serbia's holiest shrines, the 14th century Byzantine-style monastery
of Gracanica near Pristina, the provincial capital.
   Huge crowds of people, many in Serbian national costume, streamed
under a scorching sun to nearby Gazimestan, a hilly part of the
battlefield crowned by a stone monument honoring those who died
fighting the Turks in 1389.
   Thousands of buses and private cars decorated with Serbian flags,
portraits of Milosevic and religious symbols jammed roads for miles.
   An enthusiastic cheer greeted about 100 American Serbs, who waved
both the Stars and Stripes and the Serbian banner. A Serbian choir
in full national dress from Toronto sang traditional songs and
danced.
   Some emigres who fled communist Yugoslavia decades ago said only
such an occasion could bring them back.
   ``My father always told me we Serbs are the live fire from
Kosovo,'' said Steve Klipa, 56, of Pittsburgh. He kissed the ground
and crossed himself.
   The Serbian Orthodox Church was prominent in the day's
ceremonies, several hours of which were broadcast on Serbian TV. The
church once was repressed by the ruling Communist Party but is
reviving in the nationalist fervor inspired by Milosevic.
   Patriarch German, 90-year-old head of the church, was seated in
the front row of honored guests at Gazimestan. Dozens of bearded
priests in flowing black robes mingled with Communist Party
dignitaries.
   ``This is fantastic; I never imagined anything like this would
happen,'' said Ljiljana Markovic, a middle-aged woman who stood atop
the hill gazing at the crowd below.
   Organizers estimated the crowd at 1.5 million. Western reporters
put it at slightly under 1 million.
   Police helicopters clattered overhead, watching over the crowd
and ferrying in Milosevic and other other Communist party officials
from Serbia and other regions.
   Serbia's exiled royal family also has been welcomed in the flush
of nationalism.
   Princess Elisabeth _ daughter of Prince Paul Karadjordjevic,
prince-regent from 1934 until the outbreak of war in 1941 _ attended
ceremonies in Belgrade on Sunday and was said to be in the crowd
Wednesday.

   The 14 Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders who quit over
proposed uniform and policy changes they considered unwholesome have
returned after a meeting with the football team's owner.
   The 14 met with Jerry Jones, owner of the National Football
League club, on Tuesday. Leslie Haynes, the new director of the
squad, said Jones was ``very positive, and I feel they firmly
believe him or they wouldn't have decided to come back.''
   Former cheerleader director Debbie Bond, who resigned June 22
along with the squad's 14 veteran cheerleaders, refused to return.
   ``We all talked about the issues that I had with Mr. Jones and
the assurances he gave me,'' Mrs. Haynes said. ``We got our feelings
and any animosity out. It took a while to break some of the girls
down.''
   Jones, an Arkansas oilman who bought the team in February, said
he and the cheerleaders had ``a real good meeting.''
   ``I don't know that I said anything to change their minds,''
Jones said. ``We talked and I gave them my background and where I
was coming from and my goals, and then I left and they had a
discussion and made their decision. I'm very pleased.''
   Ms. Bond told the 37 women on the squad that Jones suggested
having the cheerleaders serve as hostesses at team parties where
alcohol was served, appear in beer commercials and change their
costumes to halter tops and cycling shorts.
   Jones said Friday that he had suggested the cheerleaders not
automatically be dismissed if they were seen drinking alcohol while
in uniform or fraternizing with team members. He called it a
misunderstanding, but Ms. Bond said Jones ``was lying.''

   An imprisoned American news
photographer was allowed his first visit from a U.S. diplomat
Wednesday since his arrest three weeks ago with Moslem guerrillas
fighting the communist government.
   Tony O'Brien of Santa Fe, N.M., was visited in the office of the
State Interrogation Department by Renny Smith, a consular officer
from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.
   ``He is eating OK and not complaining about his food and looked
relaxed,'' she said. ``He is pretty happy. I gave him cheese,
chocolates, six books and paper and pencils.''
   O'Brien, a free-lance photographer working for Time-Life, was
captured by the Afghan secret service June 8 at a guerrilla hideout
in Kabul.
   Ms. Smith came from New Delhi because the U.S. Embassy in Kabul
closed in January, a few weeks before Soviet military forces
withdrew Feb. 15, ending nine years of involvement in the civil war.
   O'Brien, 43, was sharing a 10-foot-by-8-foot cell with two
Afghans, she said. Asked when he might be released, she replied: ``I
have learned not to speculate. It can be the best or the worst. Best
can be tomorrow ... worst can be 10 years of sentence and release by
a presidential pardon.''
   Afghan government officials said O'Brien would have to wait for a
court verdict even if President Najib decided to pardon him.
   ``It is difficult to put a sense of timing,'' one said privately.
``It can be one month, three months or even six months.''
   O'Brien ``felt isolated in the early stages, but now he is aware
what is being done, what his friends are doing,'' she said.
   Many embassies in Kabul closed before the Soviets left, because
of a widespread belief that the Afghan army could not be able to
guarantee the security of the capital.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December
1979. An estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers were in Afghanistan
when the withdrawal began last year.

   A former police official opened fire
in a police station today and killed the U.S. Embassy's political
officer and Grenada's acting police commissioner, officials said.
   The State Department in Washington said the gunman, a former
assistant police commissioner, was killed by other law officers
after shooting.
   Deputy Prime Minister Ben Jones said the attack occurred at about
11:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m. EDT) at Fort George, the police headquarters.
   He said John Butler, the U.S. Embassy's political officer, and
acting Police Commissioner Cosmos Raymond were killed.
   Daniel Searles, the acting superintendent of police and Collis
Barrow, the deputy police commissioner, were wounded in the attack
and taken to St. George's General Hospital, the government official
said. Both were listed in stable condition.
   Jones gave no indication of the motive for the shootings.
   The government said it would issue a statement later today.
   A secretary at the U.S. Embassy said no information was
immediately available.
   State Department press officer Dennis Harter confirmed that a
U.S. diplomat was shot and killed today. He declined to identify the
man as Butler pending notification of relatives.
   Harter said the officer was on routine business in connection
with a recently completed joint military exercise involving U.S.,
Grenadan and other eastern Caribbean military and police forces.
   ``We have no indication that our embassy officer was a deliberate
target of this crime,'' Harter said.
   ``Our information is that a former assistant police commissioner
carried out this murder after first killing Grenadan police
commissioner Raymond. Immediately thereafter, the perpetrator was
himself apprehended and killed.''
   He did not identify the former assistant police commissioner.
   Grenada is an island of about 100,000 people in the Caribbean.
   In October 1983, U.S. Marines and paratroopers, along with a
small Caribbean force, invaded the island and toppled a Marxist
junta that had seized power.

communism, and he predicted the current government would fall.
   In a defiant videotaped message made after he fled, the
raspy-voiced leader of a movement for freedom choked back tears as
he accused authorities of crushing students with tanks and burning
bodies on Tiananmen Square.
   ``Those of us who remain alive, our lives are no longer our
own,'' he said on the tape. ``The lives of those classmates and
countrymen who died for democracy, for freedom and for our beautiful
motherland have melted into ours. We must focus our will and
continue the great, patriotic democratic movement to the end.''
   A Hong Kong activist showed the tape to The Associated Press on
Wednesday, then distributed it to other news organizations.
   Wearing a T-shirt from his school, Beijing Normal University, the
21-year-old freshman who has gone into hiding looked pale and drawn
during the 18-minute tape, which was shot about a week ago. He
coughed weakly several times.
   Wu'er was hospitalized more than 10 times after he began leading
a hunger strike in May. As the movement progressed and pressure
intensified, he began vomiting blood.
   Wu'er savagely attacked China's top leaders, Deng Xiaoping,
Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun, calling them a ``band
of fascist, reactionary warlords.''
   And the goverment they run, he said, was ``just a small stumbling
block on the road of history.''
   ``This kind of government doesn't have the strength to continue
living,'' Wu'er said. ``They are the people's enemies.''
   He predicted it would last from six months to three years.
   Wu'er and his girlfriend, Liu Yan, were smuggled out of China by
a Hong Kong-based ``underground railroad'' despite a nationwide
manhunt during which his photo was posted in airports and train
stations. More than a dozen others, including two leading
intellectuals and another student leader, also have made it to
safety in this manner.
   A Hong Kong activist has declined to give details of the escape
because he said it would jeopardize others trying to flee the bloody
crackdown on dissent.
   Wu'er was by far the best-known and charismatic of the 21 student
leaders accused of ``counterrevolutionary crimes'' by the communist
leadership.
   He was also the most widely criticized. As the crackdown began,
state-run media showed a 10-minute video of the leader eating with
friends from Hong Kong, accusing him of ``feasting when his
classmates were fasting.'' When the secret tape was made, the hunger
strike already had ended.
   ``If this is feasting,'' Wu'er said in the video seen Wednesday,
``I'd like to ask this band of fascists what they call the banquets
and parties they have on public money. I'd like to ask what they
call the blood and sweat of the masses they use everyday to fatten
themselves.''
   Wu'er made several emotional references to those killed during
June 3-4 when China's army invaded Beijing and opened fire on
unarmed crowds along Changan Street, just off Tiananmen Square.
   ``I don't know how many martyrs' souls remain on Changan Street,
may they forever rest in peace,'' he said.
   He said he left Tiananmen Square on the night of the military
sweep in an ambulance.
   ``There was a classmate shot in the head and chest, his skull was
shattered. His stomach was still gurgling blood,'' he said.
   A soldier was with them, shot by his own troops, apparently by
mistake, he said.
   ``There were three people including myself, spitting blood as I
lay there unable to move.'' The classmate later died.
   ``We were so peaceful, we were so naive,'' he said, describing
the student protesters. ``We never thought ... the shamelessness and
viciousness of those wild beasts would go to such an extent.''
   Wu'er said ``many people'' were killed in Tiananmen Square,
contradicting the government's account that nobody died there.
   ``A lot of my classmates were crushed to death by tanks. They
were completely flattened by tanks on Tiananmen Square,'' he said.
   He quoted a classmate as saying soldiers used shovels to stack
the bodies, wrapping them in plastic and burning them on the square.
   Wu'er urged his countrymen to band together and fight the
government.
   ``All the participants in the movement must struggle to the
end,'' he said. ``They are like the boat trackers, paying with their
blood and their lives, pulling this big boat that is China upriver,
pulling this old boat to the glorious sea.''
   Despite his weak demeanor, Wu'er said he was ``OK.''
   ``There were innumerable tribulations and a narrow escape from
death, but I'm still safe,'' he said on the tape, the second of his
statements released by the underground network.
   In a letter dated June 15, Wu'er said that ``a black sun has
appeared in the sky of my motherland and republic.''
   ``But our life is young, stubborn and uncrushable. ... Black sun,
I'm going to shoot you down!''

<HEAD>Nevada Legislature Approves 20 Percent Insurance Rate Rollback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE McDONALD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Auto insurers have promised a court
challenge of legislation that would force them to roll back rates to
15 percent below July 1988 levels for new policies starting next
October.
   The measure was passed Tuesday by the state Assembly and Senate
and sent to Gov. Bob Miller, and aides said the governor will sign
it.
   Nevada has the fifth-highest car insurance rates in the nation,
with an average premium of $600 per driver, according to the state
insurance commissioner.
   The measure would let insurers raise rates only if they could
prove to the insurance commissioner that they would go bankrupt
without the increase.
   ``That is the toughest, in my opinion, rate rollback bill in
America,'' said Assemblyman Gene Porter, who negotiated the rollback
with the Senate.
   The Assembly approved the measure 37-5 and the state Senate then
voted 16-4 for it.
   Auto insurers termed unconstitutional a provision taking into
account profits from fire, health and life insurance when deciding
whether an insurer could raise rates on auto liability coverage.
   ``The language in this bill is more patently unconstitutional
than the language in Prop. 103,'' American Insurance Assocation
spokesman Jim Wadhams said, referring to a California rate rollback.
Parts of Proposition 103 were struck down by that state's Supreme
Court on grounds they denied insurers a fair return on their
investments.
   Wadhams also complained that lawmakers hadn't let insurers
participate in compromise negotiations.
   The insurance commissioner's office estimates auto insurance
prices have risen 5 percent in the last year, making the bill's
average rollback more than 20 percent.
   State Sen. Bob Coffin criticized the bill as inadequate, saying
legislators were winning safe political gains by voting for a bill
they knew a court would strike down later as unconstitutional.
   ``It's probably the Assembly version of `crack' cocaine: they're
going to feel good for a few minutes and then it will go away,''
Coffin said.
   State Sen. Nick Horn said lawmakers nearing the end of the
legislative session finally had to respond to voters' calls to
control insurance costs.
   ``We've been hearing tales of price-gouging all along,'' Horn
said. ``This finally serves the people by providing some rollbacks.''
   Porter, who headed a study commission on auto insurance costs,
had submitted 14 different insurance reform proposals this session,
including a rate rollback of as much as 37 percent.
   After the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee delayed action on
that rollback, lawmakers agreed to insert Porter's insurance rules
into a 10 percent rollback proposed by state Sen. Jack Vergiels.

<HEAD>Court: New Jersey Has No Jurisdiction for Mickey Mouse Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit in which a boy accuses Mickey
Mouse of assaulting him at Walt Disney World cannot be tried in the
youngster's home state, an appeals court ruled Wednesday.
   The decision upheld a Morris County trial court's ruling against
Evan Makopoulos and his mother, Paula, of Parsippany. They claimed
they should be allowed to sue in New Jersey because of the
difficulty of attending a trial in Florida, where Disney World is
located.
   Anthony Macri, a lawyer for the Makopoulos family, argued that
Disney World does business in New Jersey because it advertises
heavily in the state to draw visitors.
   The judges did not dispute that argument, but noted that Disney
did not advertise in New Jersey in 1982 and 1983, when the mother
and son visited.
   Macri said he would appeal to the state Supreme Court.
   ``What we have here is a young man who was assaulted and hasn't
had his day in court,'' Macri said. ``It just doesn't seem fair.''
   Ms. Makopoulos also had her case dismissed by a Florida court on
procedural grounds, a decision that was upheld on appeal there.
   The boy was 4 in 1983 when he tugged on the Mickey Mouse
character's coattails to get his attention for an autograph. Macri
claims Evan Makopoulos suffered psychological trauma and minor
injuries when the character repeatedly threw him against a wall.
   ``Mickey Mouse has been completely exonerated,'' said Disney
lawyer Richard Tanner. ``Walt Disney World is not doing business in
New Jersey and can't be sued here.''

<HEAD>Bush Urged to Provide New Aid to Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish-American leaders urged President Bush on
Wednesday to provide millions of dollars in new aid for Poland to
forestall economic turmoil that could doom moves toward democracy in
the communist bloc nation.
   They said Bush assured them he has already begun talking with
Western allies about debt relief for Poland, which Bush will visit
July 9-11.
   The Polish American Congress leaders, including president Edward
J. Moskal of Chicago, did not put a price tag on how big a relief
package they had in mind, other than saying it should be a
``multimillion dollar'' one.
   Bush went to the Polish-American community of Hamtramck, Mich.,
April 17 to propose new aid for Poland tied to government reforms,
including recognition of Solidarity, debt-relief and moves to
encourage private enterprise.
   Bush reiterated Tuesday that he would have an aid package for
Poland, but said he will insist ``that Poland itself will have taken
the steps necessary to have the money well-spent. I don't want to
just push money down the drain.''
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the aid package
is still being developed in the National Security Council.
   Poland owes $39 billion, only $2.5 billion of it to the United
States.
   Asked if they were satisfied with the approach Bush outlined in
Hamtramck, Moskal said, ``We'd like to see a little more, but we
didn't come asking for pie in the sky.''
   Moskal, who is also president of the Polish National Alliance,
said, ``We need some substantial assistance, primarily with private
enterprise, restructuring of the loan, aid for the ecological
situation there, the agriculture situation _ a general uplifting.
   ``We're also looking for some sign that the people will be able
to grasp and say, well, there's a future for them yet,'' he said.
   ``There's so much need over there. ... The economy's a shambles.
You've got 45 years of communism over there, which is nothing less
than bankruptcy,'' said Moskal.
   He said Bush told them he was advocating restructuring of Polish
debt in the Paris Club of creditor nations, in the International
Montetary Fund and in the World Bank.
   ``There are steps being taken and from what we gathered, there
are steps already being taken with the other Western allies,''
including Great Britain, West Germany and France, he said.
   In Poland, Moskal said, both the communist government and the
Solidarity movement ``realize what the stakes are. ... Nobody's
looking for a China solution over there.''
   Jan Nowak, national director of the Polish American Congress,
``What is needed is something that would allay the danger of some
upheaval in the next six months.''
   ``Any suppression by force of massive strikes or riots would
bring to power Stalinists ... hard-liners who are already feeding on
the election defeat, and that would mean the Chinese scenario,' said
Nowak.
   ``If the Polish experiment would end in failure following so soon
the Chinese experience, it would have a tremendous negative impact
on the process of changes in the entire Soviet orbit,'' said Nowak.
``So the stakes are very high. I have an impression the president
understands this very well.''

<HEAD>KGB Chief Says American Spy Committed Suicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst who spied
for the Soviet Union cracked under the pressure of his work before
he committed suicide, the head of the KGB said Wednesday.
   Defector Glenn Michael Souther killed himself June 22 at age 32,
according to Soviet officials.
   ``His nervous system could not stand the pressure,'' said Gen.
Vladimir Kryuchkov.
   After his obituary in the Soviet military newspaper Red Star
listed his name as Mikhail Y. Orlov, speculation arose that Souther
had been a Soviet mole, but Kryuchkov discounted that, saying he was
a native-born American.
   Souther never admitted spying. He had been under investigation by
the FBI when he disappeared in 1986 from his job as a civilian
intelligence specialist in the Navy's 2nd Fleet headquarters in
Norfolk, Va.
   His obituary Tuesday in Red Star, an illustrated article on him
Wednesday in the government newspaper Izvestia, and Kryuchkov's
comments amounted to unusual publicity for any KGB officer and a
rare Soviet admission of spying.
   But Kryuchkov shrugged off the disclosures, saying, ``You have
spies, we have spies.''
   Soviet reports on Souther's death said he was driven to betray
his country because of a fear of nuclear war and a growing interest
in Russian culture.
   His nerves were a problem even in the ``several years'' he spied
before defecting in 1986, Kryuchkov told reporters outside the
meeting hall of the Soviet legislature.
   ``He long ago started to show a nervous state of mind. He was a
gifted, emotional, caring, sensitive person. He was easily hurt,''
the KGB chief said.
   Kryuchkov would not say how Souther took his life, but that ``the
motive was not political.''
   He said Souther left a note thanking the Soviet government for
what it did for him personally.
   Izvestia said Souther took the name Mikhail Orlov only after he
arrived in the Soviet Union. It said he was born in Hammond, Ind.,
which the FBI confirmed.
   Souther's parents, brother and sister traveled to Moscow for his
military funeral Monday, the KGB chief said. He was buried in the
military section of Kuntsevo Cemetery, the resting place of British
traitor Kim Philby.
   The Izvestia article was accompanied by two photographs, one of a
clean-shaven Souther at a chess board and the other showing him with
a full dark beard.
   Souther enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1975 and became petty
officer first class before being honorably discharged in 1982,
according to U.S. records.
   Izvestia said he served as a military photographer aboard the
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Nimitz in the U.S. 6th Fleet, and
on other Navy ships in the Mediterranean Sea.
   ``There he comprehended the real danger of the nuclear threat,
which pushed him into fight against it in the ranks of Soviet
intelligence,'' Izvestia said.
   Souther then went to work for U.S. Nayy intelligence analyzing
satellite photographs and worked with top-secret information at the
Norfolk base, Izvestia said. It was there his worries over nuclear
war led to an ``internal breakup,'' the newspaper said.
   Through his Russian language studies at Old Dominion University
in Virginia, he ``saw in the U.S.S.R. a country that was closer to
his soul and his convictions,'' Izvestia said.
   Some of the people who knew Souther at Old Dominion speculated he
committed suicide because of his disillusionment with the Soviet
Union.
   ``They used him like a spider playing with a moth and when they
were going to finish with him, they finished with him,'' said
Barbara Fahey, a professor's wife who knew him in school.
   Ronald Kessler, a U.S. writer preparing a book on Souther, said
the defector referred to ``my life's vicissitudes'' in a letter he
sent the writer this month. ``He was perhaps having second thoughts
or having trouble adjusting over there,'' Kessler said.
   Souther was survived by a Russian wife and an 18-month-old
daughter, according to Soviet news reports.

   Japan, facing the threat of heavy trade
sanctions, has agreed to open its multibillion-dollar Tokyo
marketplace to U.S. cellular telephones and to loosen restraints on
business radios, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
Wednesday.
   The agreement, which focused on Motorola Inc.'s attempts to
extend its cellular business into the lucrative Tokyo-Nagoya region,
averts a showdown on July 10, when the United States had said it was
prepared to slap tariffs of as much as 100 percent on more than 50
Japanese electronics imports.
   Mrs. Hills, who announced the agreement after talks here with
officials representing Japan's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, said she hoped the settlement ``will be a
precedent for the entire telecommunications market in Japan.''
   The United States had a trade deficit with Japan of about $52
billion last year, and the Motorola problem became a test of how new
Japanese Prime Minister Sosuke Uno would treat the festering
U.S.-Japan trade issue.
   The agreement affects cellular phones and ``third-party'' radios,
such as equipment used for dispatching taxis and delivery trucks,
and pagers.
   It will be particularly advantageous for Motorola's new
pocket-sized cellular phone, which the company is just bringing to
market at about $2,500 a copy.
   Motorola, the principal American maker of cellular phones and
business radios, had contended the Japanese restrictions cost $2
billion in lost sales over five years.
   ``The measures should provide immediate improvements for U.S.
companies in these two high-growth segments of the Japanese
telecommunications market,'' Mrs. Hills said. ``There should be
significant additional benefits when fully implemented.''
   She said the agreement forestalls U.S. retaliation against
Japanese exports.
   Mrs. Hills said the Japanese agreed to changes in licensing
procedures for third-party radio companies, improved access to the
broadcast spectrum needed for third-party radio and cellular phones
sold by foreign companies and ``adoption of other rules which will
treat foreign third-party radio companies on a more equitable
basis.''
   The list of potential targets for higher U.S. tariffs had
included Japanese color television sets, tape recorders and
photocopying machines. That variety of goods, including some of the
most popular Japanese electronic devices sold in this country,
emphasized how seriously the administration was taking this issue.
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., who led a campaign by 16 members of
the House to persuade the Japanese to negotiate, said, ``Once the
Japanese realized we were deadly serious about this problem, they
moved quickly to help settle it. Today's agreement is proof positive
that our trade law can work to help open markets and also that we
should not be shy about confronting our trading partners on problems
such as this.''
   The U.S. trade representative's office on April 28 declared that
Japan had violated a 1986 trade agreement by limiting Motorola's
sales. It said the United States would act against Japanese products
on July 10.
   Informal negotiations have been held for the past several weeks,
and Japan sent an envoy, Ichiro Ozawa, to Washington last week for
stepped-up talks.
   Motorola, which is based in Schaumberg, Ill., has sold its
cellular phones in Japan since 1987 through a Japanese company,
Daini-Denden Inc. But Motorola's phones would not work in Japan's
largest market, the Tokyo area, because the Motorola equipment is
not compatible with the cellular phone network operated by the
Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp.
   The Japanese government had said there was not enough space
available on Tokyo's crowded airwaves to accommodate Motorola's
system. But last year the government assigned new frequencies to a
Japanese company, Convenience Radio Telephone, prompting Motorola to
complain to the Bush administration, Motorola spokesman Rusty
Brashear said.
   In the negotiations, the Japanese agreed to shift allocations of
airwave space from a Japanese company, IDO, to allow Motorola's
agent, Daini-Denden, access part of the broadcast spectrum in the
Tokyo area immediately. Further access will be phased in later in
Tokyo and other areas of the country for both DDI and IDO, Brashear
said.

   A man convicted of firing five shots into the
head of a rookie police officer allegedly on behalf of a jailed drug
lord was sentenced Wednesday to a maximum 25-years-to-life term in
prison.
   David McClary, 23, received the sentence from Judge Thomas
Demakos at state court in Queens, where he was convicted on June 6.
   ``You showed no compassion or regard for the life of another
human being,'' Demakos said. ``Society, in turn, should have no
compassion or regard for your life by placing you permanently behind
bars.''
   McClary also received a concurrent 5- to 15-year term on a
weapons charge _ the same sentence his three co-defendants received
from Demakos.
   Demakos told McClary his last act as a judge will be to urge that
the state parole board never release the killer.
   The Byrne murder received national attention during the 1988
presidential campaign when the slain officer's father, Matthew
Byrne, presented his son's shield to President Bush during a
pro-death penalty rally.
   Byrne was guarding the home of a drug case witness on Feb. 26,
1988, when he was shot to death. Prosecutors charged Philip Copeland
masterminded the killing, while Todd Scott was the lookout and Scott
Cobb was the getaway driver.
   All three are serving 25-years-to-life sentences in the slaying.
Prosecutors said the killing was ordered by reputed drug kingpin
Howard ``Pappy'' Mason to avenge his jailing on a weapons charge.
Mason has not been charged in Byrne's death.

<HEAD>Farm-Policy Pendulum Swinging Toward Free Market: Study</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's 60-year-old farm-policy pendulum
is swinging away from reliance on government toward the free market,
according to a private study released Wednesday.
   ``The evolution of agricultural policy toward less government
intervention and control is a very positive trend, based on
fundamental economic and social changes,'' the report said.
   ``Agriculture today is very different than it was in the 1930s
when most of our current programs were designed.''
   The study, released by Washington consultants Lesher, Russell and
Moos for the Agricultural Policy Working Group, said agriculture is
``a much more integral part of the national economy'' today than 60
years ago.
   Farms also are more similar to other businesses across the nation
than those of half a century ago, the study said.
   Farm law passed in 1985 expires next year, and Congress has begun
preliminary work on a 1990 bill.
   Although the current law _ the Food Security Act of 1985 _ is
noted for its major commodity programs and their various
price-support mechanisms, it also ranges widely, with programs for
food stamps, nutrition, conservation, trade, credit, research and
many other functions.
   The study concentrates on the crop programs, including wheat,
feed grains, cotton and soybeans, and their effect on the nation's
economy.
   Officials of the consulting company include Bill Lesher and Randy
Russell, senior economists in the Agriculture Department in the
early Reagan years and chief architects of the 1985 farm
legislation. Gene Moos is a former agricultural aide to Rep. Tom
Foley, D-Wash., now House speaker.
   Members of the sponsoring group are major companies deeply
involved in agriculturally related enterprises _ Cargill Inc.,
Central Soya Company Inc., Louis Dreyfus Corp., IMC Fertilizer Group
Inc., Monsanto Co., Nabisco Brands Inc., and Norfolk Southern Corp.
   The study was done by Government Research Corp., part of the
public relations firm Hill and Knowlton, and Economic Perspectives
Inc. of McLean, Va., since last fall part of Sparks Commodities Inc.
of Memphis, Tenn.
   One course, the study said, would be for Congress to extend
current farm law, which ``is regarded to have worked well.'' But
tacking on another five years ``would produce a stagnant sector,
severely limited by sluggish market growth.''
   Another option calling for ``planting flexibility'' would retain
the basic structure of the 1985 farm law but without specific crop
acreage bases. Instead, the acreage bases for such crops as wheat,
corn and cotton _ plus the acreage typically planted to soybeans _
would be combined into a single farm base.
   Acreage idling programs would still be used to control
production, but the set-asides would be from the whole farm base,
not specific crop bases.
   The flexibility option over five years would result in smaller
annual carryover supplies, or surpluses, ``faster market growth and
somewhat higher incomes'' for farmers,'' the report said.
   A third option would be another form of decoupling, which would
continue historical federal income supports to farmers, but without
annual requirements for idling specific crop acreages. Farmers would
be free to plant what they choose.
   The report said decoupling would require ``a transition period,
during which prices and sales receipts would decline,'' but that
declining farm income could be avoided by making federal income
support payments larger in the early years.
   ``Following about two years of adjustment, increased market
growth would bring price recovery and higher incomes as well,'' the
report said.

   The federal court jury deliberated for 12 days before finding the
defendants guilty of narcotics trafficking, pornography, auto theft,
loan sharking and extortion.
   Among the murder victims were witnesses and intermediaries for
Florida drug dealers. One victim was dismembered and his body parts
left in a garbage bag behind a store in Queens.
   It was one of the longest trials in federal history. Testimony
came from more than 200 witnesses who described 17 murders and other
criminal acts.
   The case, which dates back to a 1984 indictment, is one of the
last trials stemming from a series of widely publicized, mob-related
prosecutions brought by then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani.
   The original 78-count indictment charged that Paul Castellano
headed a racketeering enterprise, the Gambino family, named for
one-time reputed mob leader Don Carlo Gambino. It is one of five
major organized crime families in the city.
   U.S. District Judge Keven T. Duffy, who originally had the case,
broke it up in 1985 with the first trial focusing on a ring that
allegedly stole hundreds of cars in New York.
   Before the conclusion of that case, Castellano was gunned down
outside a mid-Manhattan restaurant in December 1985. Eventually six
of the eight defendants remaining in that trial were convicted of
various charges.
   Among the prosecution witnesses in this latest trial were Vito
Arena, a hitman-turned-informer who admitted his part in four
slayings, and Francis ``Mickey'' Featherstone, a one-time enforcer
for the Westies, a predominantly Irish gang on Manhattan's West Side.
   Defense attorneys attacked the credibility of the prosecution
witnesses. One attorney said they were ``the worst collection of
people that has ever come into one criminal trial.''
   The seven convicted defendants are Anthony Senter, 34; Ronald
Ustica, 44; Sol Hellman, 63; Joseph Testa, 34; Salvatore Mangialino,
52; Douglas Rega, 39; and Carlo Profeta, whose age was unavailable.
   Prosecutors alleged that the crew was headed by Roy DeMeo, who
was killed by gang members in a power struggle in 1983.
   Another key defendant, Anthony Gaggi, died of natural causes
during the case. Gaggi was identified as a captain of the Gambino
family who was a close adviser to Castellano.

   Israeli troops Wednesday shot and killed a
Palestinian radical who kidnapped an American relief worker last
week, the army said.
   Earlier, a bomb wounded three Israelis and an Arab in a crowded,
open-air market in the Israeli town of Ramle, and vengeful Israelis
stabbed two Arabs, police said. Paramilitary police rushed to the
town near Tel Aviv to prevent further violence against Arabs.
   The dead Palestinian radical, Mohammed Abu Nasr, was identified
as leader of a three-man gang that abducted Chris George of
Montclair, N.J., on June 22.
   Israel television and Arab reports said Nasr was in a taxi he had
hijacked when soldiers shot him. He was carrying a pistol and two
clips of bullets, said an army statement that gave no details of the
shooting.
   George was freed unharmed after a day when he agreed to carry a
letter from Nasr pleading with President Bush to recognize
Palestinian rights.
   The army said Nasr is suspected of two other Gaza Strip attacks
this month. In one, an Israeli military government employee was shot
and wounded, and in the other, an Israeli gasoline truck driver was
hit in the head with an ax.
   Israeli news reports said George was abducted by the Palestine
Liberation Organization, but Yasser Arafat's organization maintains
Nasr acted on his own and was mentally deranged.
   Nasr, who was in his late 30s, had been jailed for being a member
of Arafat's Fatah faction and was released in a 1985 prisoner swap.
   George, 35, declined comment on his kidnapper's death.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Israeli
troops wounded at least 13 Palestinians in clashes with
stone-throwers, and a man died of injuries suffered in a beating by
youths who accused him of collaborating with Israel.
   His death brings the toll to 538 Palestinians killed since Arabs
started revolting against Israeli occupation in December 1987.
Sixty-nine have been killed by Arabs as suspected collaborators.
Twenty-three Israelis also have been killed.
   Israel's Supreme Court denied a Palestinian's appeal against
deportation, authorizing the expulsion of the 48th resident of the
occupied territories since the revolt began. It ruled Bilal Izzidin
Hussein Shakhsheer, 37, carried out anti-Israeli activities for an
outlawed extremist PLO faction.
   A survey of 104 leaders in the West Bank and Gaza showed 83
percent favor an Israeli plan to hold elections for Palestinian
representatives to negotiate with Israel, but only under certain
conditions, a Palestinian magazine reported.
   Bayader Assiyassi said it asked if leaders favored elections on
condition Israeli troops withdraw from occupied cities before
internationally supervised elections.
   Eighty-six percent of those favoring elections insisted troops be
withdrawn from all the occupied lands, the survey showed.
   PLO and some Palestinian leaders in the occupied lands reject
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan, saying it does not guarantee
an independent Palestinian state.
   In apparent response to right-wing opponents of his plan, Shamir
said Wednesday that crushing the 18-month uprising is Israel's
``first security objective.''
   But he added, ``It should be clear ... that Israel has
consciously and deliberately refrained from taking the ruthless
measures that could have ended in violence.''
   He was addressing an international conference of Jewish leaders,
where American Seymour Reich criticized proposals to move an
expected wave of Soviet immigrants to Jewish settlements in the
occupied lands.
   ``Soviet Jews should be absorbed through the normal process of
resettlement,'' said Reich, head of the Conference of Presidents of
Major Jewish Organizations.
   He noted the U.S. administration likely would object. America
opposes the settlements as an obstacle to a U.S.-backed proposal of
trading land for peace.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Ceausescu quotes. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu strongly
criticized reforms in the Soviet bloc and made clear he does not
intend to adopt them, Romania's official Agerpress news agency said
Wednesday.
   Ceausescu made the comments in a speech to the Communist Party's
Central Committee after being unanimously nominated for re-election
to the party leadership, Agerpres said.
   ``We must take a firm attitude against any attempts to denigrate
socialism,'' Ceausescu was quoted as telling the Bucharest meeting.
   ``One should firmly reject the attempts of the reactionary,
imperialist circles to destabilize and blacken socialism for the
obvious purpose of checking or, at least, delaying ... the nations'
march for progress,'' Ceausescu reportedly said.
   Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union have adopted reforms that
grant the private economy some role in the overall national economy.
   In Romania, East Germany and Czehcolsovakia, however, the
communist leaderships have either rejected the need for change or
adopted only cautious economic reforms.
   The party leader will be chosen when Romania's Communist Party
convenes its 14th congress on Nov. 20-25.
   At the last two congresses in 1979 and 1984, Ceausescu also was
nominated as the sole candidate for the top party job. His
subsequent election was a foregone conclusion.
   ``We are fully confident that this historic proposal springs from
the love, regard and gratitude of the Central Committee members, of
all (Romanian) communists,'' said Politburo member Manea Manescu in
backing Ceausescu's nomination.

   A tanker carrying about 3,000 tons of gasoline
caught fire in Havana harbor and was being towed out to sea
Wednesday to be destroyed because it was in danger of exploding, the
Cuban news agency reported.
   ``Firefighting units from the Interior Ministry are towing the
vessel at least five miles out to sea ... where helicopter gunships
will fire several rounds at it to cause an explosion,'' Prensa
Latina said.
   The tanker, August 23rd, caught fire Tuesday night while docked
at the Nico Lopez refinery, Prensa Latina said in a dispatch from
Havana that was monitored in Mexico City.
   ``The (Havana) port captain's office has banned all navigation in
a radius of five miles around the boat,'' the agency said. ``The
cause of the fire is being investigated.''
   The agency said Cuba purchased the tanker from Romania a year ago.

<HEAD>Navy Eases Deployment of Aircraft Carriers in Indian Ocean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thanks to the continuing cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war, the Pentagon has decided it can revise its deployment
policy for the Indian Ocean to one that doesn't require the
continuous presence of an aircraft carrier, defense officials said
Wednesday.
   The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the United States
had no intention of withdrawing its naval forces from the Indian
Ocean or the Persian Gulf.
   But with the truce still holding in the Iran-Iraq war, ``we don't
need a non-stop presence,'' explained one official. ``We don't need
an aircraft carrier parked outside the Persian Gulf.''
   Before 1980 and the Iranian hostage crisis, the United States
routinely sent aircraft carrier battle groups to the Indian Ocean on
a staggered basis, leaving gaps of as much as a month or two. As
hostilities then heated up in the Persian Gulf, that policy was cast
aside in favor of keeping at least one aircraft carrier on station
outside the gulf at all times.
   ``But the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq will have held up for
a year in August, so we're going back to our old approach,''
explained one source.
   Although it attracted little attention, the first gap in the Navy
presence already has occurred. The aircraft carrier Ranger was
allowed to depart its station outside the gulf in the northern
Arabian Sea before a replacement, the America, arrived in the region.
   The America just steamed through the Suez Canal into the Indian
Ocean, one official said Wednesday, but such gaps in coverage will
become commonplace starting this fall.
   The source also said the Navy would occasionally send in battle
groups built around battleships instead of aircraft carriers.
   Another official said the change in policy was driven in part by
the recent budget decision of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to
maintain 14 carriers in the Navy instead of 15.
   A second source downplayed that factor, however, saying the key
reason for the change was the end to the fighting between Iran and
Iraq.

<HEAD>Communists Get Their Turn at Forming Coalition Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in their 71-year
history, Greece's communists were given a chance Wednesday to form a
government after the socialists and conservatives failed to do so.
   The Coalition of the Left and Progress seemed set on using its
three-day mandate to discuss possibilities of a ``national unity
government.'' But efforts to form an all-party government were
hampered by the two larger parties' insistence on leading it.
   National elections June 18 failed to produce a winner. The
Coalition, an anti-American grouping of the Greek Communist Party
and the Eurocommunist Greek Left, emerged as the power broker with
28 seats in the 300-seat unicameral Parliament.
   The conservative New Democracy Party won 145 seats. The
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, came in second with 125
seats, ending eight years of socialist rule.
   Coalition leader Harilaos Florakis has been general secretary of
the Communist Party since 1974, when it was legalized after the fall
of the military dictatorship. It was founded in 1918.
   The Coalition rejected a joint-rule proposal by PASOK leader
Andreas Papandreou, the hospitalized caretaker premier, whose
mandate to form a government ended Tuesday night. Before that, the
conservatives had tried to form a government.
   Florakis said his party proposed a government of ``widespread
acceptance'' that would not be led by Papandreou or New Democracy
leader Constantine Mitsotakis.
   Mitsotakis ruled out formation of a government that would not be
headed by himself.
   ``How is it possible for the 13 percent of the Greek people to
impose their will on the 44 percent?'' Mitsotakis said.
   New Democracy won 44 percent of the vote, PASOK 39 and the
Coalition 13 percent.
   If the Coalition cannot form a government by Friday, President
Christos Sartzetakis will ask the three major parties to try to set
aside their differences and form a coalition. If that fails, the
president will call early elections under a caretaker administration.
   PASOK officials have tried to reach an agreement with the
communists on a long-term coalition but rejected proposals that did
not give Papandreou the premiership.
   The Coalition, a strongly anti-American party, calls for the
removal of U.S. military bases in Greece and withdrawal from NATO.
   Papandreou has pledged to put any new agreement with the
Americans on the four bases to a national referendum. The previous
agreement ended in December.
   ``Cooperation on national issues includes a referendum on the
bases,'' said Akis Tsohatzopoulos, a member of PASOK's executive
bureau.
   Tsohatzopoulos was appointed to negotiate with the communists
because Papandreou was still in Athens' General State Hospital.
   Papandreou was hospitalized Thursday for pneumonia but later
developed heartand kidney complications. A hospital bulletin
Wednesday said he was ``no longer in critical condition and in 2-3
days we will be able to say when he will be dismissed.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Cuts Governors' Control Over National Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government, not state governors, has
the final authority over the deployment of National Guard troops
outside the United States, an appeals court ruled Wednesday.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an amendment that
prohibits governors from withholding consent to send troops outside
the country because of objections to the location, purpose, type or
schedule of active duty.
   ``We hold that the Constitution does not require gubernatorial
consent to active duty for training of the National Guard of the
United States,'' the court said in its 7-2 opinion.
   The original lawsuit was filed on behalf of Minnesota Gov. Rudy
Perpich by Hubert H. Humphrey III, the state's attorney general.
Minnesota was joined in the suit by the states of Colorado,
Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio and Vermont.
   Opposing them was the Defense Department, which was joined as
friends of the court by the National Guard Association of the United
States and the states of Alabama, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi and Missouri.
   In 1985 and 1986, several governors objected to deployment of
National Guard personnel to Central America. The governors withheld
or threatened to withhold their consent to federally ordered active
duty missions by their states' National Guard units.
   In response, Congress enacted the Montgomery Amendment, which
prohibits the governors from withholding consent.
   After members of the Minnesota National Guard participated in
three active duty training missions in Honduras in January 1987,
Perpich filed suit seeking a declaration of the governors'
constitutional authority.
   Perpich asked specifically for a declaration that the Montgomery
Amendment infringed on the states' right under the Constitution to
train the militia. The lawsuit sought to enjoin any federal order
commanding members of the Minnesota unit of the National Guard to
active duty for training outside the country without Perpich's
consent.
   A U.S. District Court ruled against Perpich, saying the dual
enlistment system, under which Guard members enlist and serve in
both the state National Guard and the federal National Guard, was a
proper exercise of Congress' power to raise and support armies.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed that ruling, however, holding that the Montgomery Amendment
violated the constitutional authority of states to train its militia.
   That ruling said the National Guard could not be ordered to
active duty for training without the consent of the states unless
Congress or the president first declared a national security
emergency.
   The federal government appealed and was granted a rehearing on
the issue by the full appeals court.
   Senior Circuit Judge Gerald W. Heaney strongly disagreed with
Wednesday's ruling.
   ``With a few strokes of the word processor,'' Heaney said in his
dissent, ``the majority has written the Militia Clause out of the
United States Constitution.
   ``In so doing, it contradicts the clear intent of the founding
fathers, who believed that state control over elements of the
military was essential to a free and peaceful republic.''

<HEAD>West German Company Cancels Deal to Ship Chemicals to Iran</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company said Wednesday it has
canceled a contract to supply Iran with chemicals produced in India
that could be used to make poison gas.
   The Rheineisen Chemical Products company of Duesseldorf made the
announcement after West German officials began an investigation into
whether the firm had violated federal export laws. It said the
delivery would not be made.
   Also on Wednesday, federal officials announced West Germany was
trying to block delivery of 257 tons of thionyl chloride before it
left India for Iran.
   The Duesseldorf company acknowledged it arranged the deal, but an
attorney for the company said customs officials had told it the
shipment to Iran would not violate export laws.
   ``A customs employee confirmed on May 22 that there were no
objections to the shipment,'' said attorney Georg Greeven.
   Dieter Vogel, spokesman for the Economics Ministry, said
Rheineisen could face prosecution if it is determined an export
permit was required for the shipment. The company did not apply for
such a permit, he said.
   West German authorities say the investigation into the deal was
begun after U.S. officials last week alerted Bonn about the
Duesseldorf company's involvement.
   West Germany has been trying to crack down on illegal exports
since allegations last year that German companies helped build a
Libyan plant that U.S. officials said was intended to produce
chemical weapons.
   Libya said the plant was making pharmaceuticals.
   West German authorities arrested the head of the Imhausen-Chemie
company in connection with the Libyan deal.
   Greeven said Rheineisen was able ``at the last moment'' to keep
the first delivery of the chemicals from being loaded aboard a ship
in India. He did not give other details.
   ``The company will not be resuming this transaction,'' he said.
   Greeven said the chemicals were made by a company in India called
Transpec. He did not give the location of the firm. He also did not
indicate whether Rheineisen knew the chemical could be used to make
mustard gas.
   Company spokesman Juergen Tigler said ``if officials had
expressed any objections'' to the deal ``the whole thing would have
been called off.''
   Doris Grimm, spokeswoman for the Transport Ministry, said a West
German shipping company owns the vessel slated to transport the
chemicals. She refused to identify the ship or the company.
   She also said the vessel is flying the flag of a foreign country,
which under West German law could make prosecution of its owners
impossible.

   A Pennsylvania congressman, citing the case of
a 92-year-old woman who was dragged out of her home kicking and
screaming, said Wednesday that Congress should help elderly
Americans who face eviction.
   ``We need a mechanism by which there would be ... an automatic
community response to the anguish of an elderly person about to lose
one's home or be evicted,'' Rep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., said in
testimony before the House subcommittee on human resources.
   Gekas introduced an amendment in February to the Older Americans
Act of 1965 that would require states that receive funds under the
act to notify the area agency on aging when legal procedures are
begun that would result in a person 65 or older losing his home
because of non-payment of debt.
   Gekas' bill would require written notification of the state
agency within seven days after the proceedings have begun and would
halt any action for at least 60 days.
   The proposed legislation was prompted by last summer's eviction
of Effie Kapates from her Harrisburg, Pa., home. The house was sold
after the 92-year-old woman failed to pay back taxes on the property.
   ``She was screaming and squirming and resisting to the last
moment against sheriff's deputies doing their duty,'' Gekas said.
   ``I have an 89-year-old mother and I would hate to see her being
carried from her own home,'' said subcommittee chairman Dale Kildee,
D-Mich.
   Elizabeth A. Schreffler, executive director of the Dauphin
County, Pa., Area Agency on Aging, testified that her agency was not
notified until two weeks before the eviction, even though Kapates
had lost title to her house four years earlier.
   ``She would have been eligible to receive a 100 percent tax
rebate through the auspice of the Pennsylvania lottery fund,''
Schreffler said, adding that Kapates later moved in with a daughter.
   ``In a way, we failed that lady as a community,'' Gekas said.
   Advocates for the elderly generally back the legislation, but
some don't want it linked to state funding.
   ``Withholding older American Act funding because of the lack of
action by a state legislature could jeopardize many older persons
who depend on OAA-supported nutrition programs,'' said Margaret
Williams, president of the National Association of Area Agencies on
Aging.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will meet Friday with
anti-apartheid activist Albertina Sisulu to pay tribute to her
``courageous personal struggle for human rights,'' the White House
said Wednesday.
   Mrs. Sisulu, 71, and her family have become a symbol of the
struggle of South Africa's blacks against apartheid.
   Bush extended an invitation to Mrs. Sisulu to visit the United
States last month after he met with Bishop Desmond Tutu and other
anti-apartheid leaders at the White House.
   ``The president will recognize her for her courageous personal
struggle for human rights and dignity,'' Fitzwater said.
   Mrs. Sisulu, a nurse by profession, is one of three joint
presidents of the United Democratic Front, treasurer of the Women's
League of the outlawed African National Congress and a founder of
the Federation of South African Women.
   Her husband, Walter Sisulu, has been serving a jail sentence
since 1964 for helping found the guerrilla arm of the African
National Congress along with its jailed leader, Nelson Mandela.
   Two of her five children have fled into exile to avoid arrest,
and Mrs. Sisulu has served various jail terms and been under house
arrest and other government restrictions for 18 years.
   The government of South Africa gave her a 31-day passport to make
the visit, the first time she has been allowed out of the country.
   Bush has opposed further economic sanctions against the minority
white-ruled government of South Africa, other than the limited
sanctions his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, was forced to impose by
Congress in 1986 over his veto.
   But Bush has endorsed a more forceful U.S. role in pressing for
an end apartheid and political rights to South Africa's blacks, who
outnumber the whites, 28 million to 5 million.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet here
with month with F.W. De Klerk, who is expected to assume his
country's president later this year.
   It will be the first official visit by a South African government
leader to this capital in 30 years.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers on Wednesday asked a court to
hear an intelligence agent testify that Prime Minister Olof Palme
may have been shot as part of an international conspiracy.
   The request came in the third week of the trial of Christer
Pettersson, who is charged with shooting Palme on Feb. 28, 1986, as
the Swedish leader walked home from a movie with his wife, Lisbeth.
   Pettersson, a confessed drug abuser with a long criminal record,
denies the killing.
   Lawyer Arne Liljeros asked for permission to call Jan-Henrik
Barrling, a Swedish security police officer who investigated a
militant Kurdish separatist group called the PKK, or Kurdish Workers
Party, in connection with the assassination.
   ``We want to establish that the PKK lead is still the most
credible,'' Liljeros said.
   Prosecutor Anders Helin objected that Barrling's value as a
witness is ``not very high, since all the information he can give is
secondhand.''
   The court will decide Thursday whether to call Barrling, said
Judge Carl Anton Spak.
   The Kurdish separatists were the focus of a yearlong
investigation by Stockholm police chief Hans Holmer, who was sacked
when he failed to prove a connection and refused to give up his
theory of a plot.
   Police on Wednesday began investigating Holmer on suspicion of
misappropriating funds, Sweden's national TT news agency reported.
   The Kurdish group was branded a terrorist organization by the
Palme government, which also denied refugee status to one of its
leaders. Telephone taps of some separatist members before the
killing appeared to indicate some sort of plot.
   Barrling has been linked to a group that privately pursued the
Kurdish connection. He was indicted for helping smuggle in illegal
eavesdropping equipment, and awaits trial. Justice Minister
Anna-Greta Leijon was forced to resign for supporting the amateur
detectives.
   The prosecution's case rests on Lisbeth Palme's identification of
Pettersson, 42, in court as the man she saw a few feet away after
her husband fell to the ground, fatally wounded.
   In court Wednesday, three passersby testified that only one
person was close enough to Palme to shoot him, although none could
support Mrs. Palme's identification. Two of the witnesses saw the
man fire a gun.
   Leif Ljungkvist, who was stopped at a traffic light when he heard
the shooting, said he saw a man standing near the fallen premier
stare for several seconds before turning slowly away and fleeing up
a side street. He indicated Mrs. Palme had plenty of time to see the
gunman.
   But he also said Mrs. Palme was unresponsive and ``in a state of
shock'' when he approached her two minutes after the shooting. She
has testified she was clear-headed.
   A social worker who knew Pettersson in jail also testified that
the accused showed ``a deep-rooted hatred of authorities,'' which
prosecutors say could have been his motive.

<HEAD>Turkish Cypriot Leader Urges Direct Talks; Rejects U.N. Mediation</HEAD>

   The Turkish Cypriot leader on Wednesday
rejected U.N. mediation in the Mediterranean island dispute and
called for direct talks with his Greek Cypriot rival.
   ``We are negotiating. We are not negotiating with the United
Nations. The U.N. is there to help us as good offices people,'' said
Rauf Denktash, president of the breakaway state in northern Cyprus.
   ``We must have direct, sincere, face-to-face talks so that we
know what each side is thinking and producing,'' Denktash said after
meeting with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The Turkish Cypriot's insistence is considered a major
complication in negotiations to reunify the island, which entered a
new round in New York.
   Denktash also called for more publicity, instead of current
secret talks.
   There was no immediate reaction from the Greek Cypriot side or
U.N. officials.
   In the past 10 months, the talks have made virtually no progress,
and no breakthrough is expected.
   ``We are not near any solution,'' Denktash said. ``The main
fundamental difficulties exist and no one can belittle them. But ...
the fact that we intend to continue talks is a good sign.''
   Denktash and his Greek Cypriot rival, George Vassiliou, president
of the Republic of Cyprus, met the U.N. chief Wednesday for less
than an hour each to prepare for a joint meeting Thursday.
   Vassiliou, who represents the only internationally recognized
government of Cyprus, said Wednesday he hopes for progress in what
he called a ``crucial stage of negotiations.''
   Denktash's government is recognized only by Turkey, which invaded
Cyprus in 1974 to prevent a possible union with Greece and halt
alleged persecution of the island's Turkish minority.
   Cyprus today is divided into Greek and Turkish sectors, with U.N.
troops patrolling a buffer zone between the two. About 40,000
Turkish troops are in the north of the island.
   The two sides are discussing creation of a federated state. Greek
Cypriots want a strong central government and Turkish Cypriots a
loose federation and equality of the two communities.
   Denktash's region occupies 37 percent of Cyprus and has 120,000
residents, mostly Moslems, who comprise 18 percent of the island's
population.

   A 27-year-old wheelchair marathoner rolled across
the Brooklyn Bridge to City Hall on Wednesday, completing a
5,000-mile cross-country trip to raise money for spinal cord
research.
   Joseph W. ``Bill'' Duff, a paraplegic since an auto accident in
1982, was met by Mayor Edward I. Koch, who placed a laurel wreath on
his head, and applauded by about 200 people in City Hall Plaza.
   He said he had made the trip not only to fund research but to
tell disabled people, ``If you put your mind to it, you could do
anything.''
   His muscular biceps showed bruises from rubbing against the
wheels of his chair.
   Koch said Duff told him that his greatest joy was meeting the
people in the 475 towns in 20 states through which the 111-day trip
took him. He started Jan. 17 in Los Angeles.
   ``They were what you expect Americans to be,'' Koch said. ``They
admire courage. They admire intestinal fortitude. They admire people
who overcome. That is why he is very special.''
   Duff wore shorts and a white T-shirt covered with medals from
various communities as he wheeled the final mile over the bridge in
a light drizzle.
   Asked how he had managed to push 50 miles a day, he said, ``when
you become paralyzed, you find how much you take for granted as far
as physically what you can do.''
   ``It's very easy to take the self-pity road and say, `Why me?',
and be very bitter. That's the easy path,'' he said.
   ``The most difficult path, the most challenging path is to say,
`OK! This is what life has dealt me. I can handle it. I'll be happy
at it and I'll make the best I can of it and be all I can be and try
to help my fellow man.''
   Duff, who lives in Houston and received a bachelor's degree in
mechanical engineering at the University of Texas two years ago,
undertook the marathon under the sponsorship of ``Wheels Across
America.''
   A donation of $336,000 raised by several corporations for the
marathon was issued through the sponsor Wednesday to the Miami
Project To Curb Paralysis at the University of Miami Jackson
Memorial Medical Center.
   The spokesman for the project is Marc Buoniconti, son of former
all-pro Miami Dolphin linebacker Nick Buoniconti. The younger
Buoniconti was injured while playing college football in 1985 and is
a quadriplegic.

<HEAD>15 Million Layoffs Under Economic Reforms, Reform Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy is in a state of emergency, and up to
15 million people will lose their jobs during its restructuring, the
official in charge of economic reform said at his confirmation
hearing Wednesday.
   Leonid Abalkin painted the bleak picture before the new Supreme
Soviet legislature, which approved his nomination as head of State
Commission on Economic Reform, a job carrying the rank of deputy
premier.
   Abalkin was among four Cabinet members confirmed Wednesday after
the legislature rejected, for the first time in Soviet history, a
slate of nominees for the government positions.
   ``The situation in the country is that of an emergency,'' Abalkin
said. ``Within the last year and a half, the economic situation has
been worsening with every passing month.''
   The economist said 12 million to 15 million people will become
unemployed as a result of reform by the end of the century,
according to remarks carried by the Tass news agency.
   Abalkin said the layoffs will occur as the country moves from
emphasis on production to services and as the labor force is
redistributed from state businesses to private cooperatives and
family-run businesses.
   Other economists have said unemployment will result from
streamlining the government and industry and shifting resources
within the economy.
   Abalkin, the 59-year-old director of the Institute of Economics,
told the legislators the unemployed will need job retraining,
occupational counseling and other social programs.
   Traditional Communist Party doctrine has said unemployment is
solely a Western problem resulting from exploitation of the working
class. But President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of perestroika,
or economic restructuring, is causing widespread realignment of the
Soviet labor force.
   Abalkin predicted that efforts to make the economy
market-oriented will be successful in six to seven years, at which
time the Soviet currency, the ruble, can be made convertible.
   At it stands, the ruble cannot be freely converted into other
currency, and that severely hampers foreign companies trying to do
business in the Soviet Union.
   Abalkin took the podium after his confirmation and said Soviet
efficiency must be improved.
   ``We have a budget deficit of 100 billion rubles ($156 billion)
this year,'' he said. ``There are two ways to eliminate it. Cut
expenditures or increase revenues.''
   Abalkin explained the poor Soviet standard of living with the
comment: ``We live no worse than we work.''
   Deputies laughed and then applauded.
   Under questioning from the 542-member Supreme Soviet, another
Cabinet nominee, Yuri Maslyukov, chairman of the government planning
agency Gosplan, said his agency would drastically reduce central
planning of the economy. He was then confirmed as both the new
Gosplan chairman and first deputy premier.
   Deputy Igor Griazin of Estonia said he had expected more
controversy over the 52-year-old Maslyukov, but the Gosplan chief
promised his agency would confine itself to setting major economic
factors such as the federal budget, raw materials and military
production, leaving details to the republics.
   ``Two months ago, he was opposed to all this,'' Griazin said.
``This is a new guy. I like him very much.''
   There were only six votes against Maslyukov. The hands raised to
vote `yes' were not counted as they were a clear majority.
   Lev Voronin, 61, a bureaucrat in the state supply committee, was
confirmed as a first deputy premier in charge of general matters.
   Igor Belousov, nominated as deputy premier and head of the State
Commission for Military-Industrial Affairs, told the lawmakers that
by 1995, 60 percent of the defense industry's production will be
civilian goods. Those goods will include equipment to process crops,
consumer items, medical equipment, electronics, computers and
communications devices, Belousov said.
   Gorbachev has said the defense industry will be called on to
tackle production of items in chronically short supply, namely food
and consumer goods.
   On Tuesday, Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov withdrew seven of his Cabinet
nominees after the newly elected legislature refused to support them.
   Six of the nominees were rejected in first-ever confirmation
hearings last week by committees of the Supreme Soviet, which this
year replaced the old rubber-stamp legislature. The previous
legislature did not have the power to confirm or reject top
government officials.
   The Supreme Soviet is the country's first full-time
representative legislature, a branch of the larger Congress of
People's Deputies chosen this spring in the first nationwide
contested elections in seven decades.

<TEXT>
   Seven-year-old Latricia Reese left a hospital to
the applause of well-wishers Wednesday, just a day after she was
rescued from a storm drain where she was trapped for more than 12
hours by rushing water.
   Latricia, shying away from the throng of reporters and
photographers who have trailed her since she was found with only
bruises, scrapes and a mild concussion, rode away from the hospital
with a broad smile and a car filled with toys, flowers and balloons.
   ``She came through this ordeal in a remarkable fashion. She's
going to be just fine,'' Dr. George Rodriguez said just before
Latricia was released from Humana Hospital-Southmore. ``The one
thing that she needs right now more than anything else is to be at
home with her mother.''
   Latricia was playing in a flooded ditch Monday evening in the
aftermath of Tropical Storm Allison when she was washed into a
concrete storm culvert and disappeared into the underground drainage
system. The storm dumped about a foot of rain on the region.
   The water was moving so swiftly a police diving team decided
against entering the unfamiliar sewage system.
   When the divers left and promised to come back at daybreak,
Latricia's mother feared the worst.
   ``They told me it was just a small chance (of survival), but it
would be a miracle,'' Karen Reese said. ``I thought they were coming
back to search for a body ... but we got a miracle.''
   Latricia was rescued after her cousin, DeVincent Phillips,
spotted two construction workers checking a nearby manhole Tuesday
morning and asked them to help search for the girl.
   ``It was pitch black down there,'' said Tim Gabrysch, who entered
a manhole near where Latricia disappeared. He found ``a little girl,
all scrunched up in that pipe ... and then she turned and looked at
me and I thought I'd bust.''
   Latricia, swept by the fast-moving water through several levels
of the underground drainage system, said she managed to grab a crack
in the concrete passage, hold on and keep her head above water until
the water receded.
   ``The water keeps on coming until when I let go. At first the
ants were biting me. I had to let go and then I went down
(further),'' Latricia said Wednesday.
   She suffered a mild concussion and slight shock in the accident
and often appeared confused or unaware of many aspects of her
ordeal. At times she says only her head was above water; other
times, she says only her feet were wet, and is unable to describe
her descent through the sewer system.
   Asked what she did during the night, she said, ``I prayed.''
   ``It may well be that she doesn't remember much of what happened
down there,'' Rodriguez said, citing the concussion.
   ``I think maybe there are some things she doesn't want to
remember,'' Mrs. Reese added.
   ``It was a horrible night and a terrible storm, but we found a
rainbow at the end,'' she said.

   China's new Communist Party chief said Wednesday
that government would show no mercy to leaders of the pro-democracy
movement.
   Chinese embassies in more than 20 countries said their
ambassadors were being recalled to Beijing, and a diplomatic source
said they were to meet to discuss the military crackdown on the
movement for a freer society.
   Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin said the ``work of quelling
the counterrevolutionary rebellion and putting an end to the turmoil
must be firmly carried on.''
   ``We should thoroughly expose and mete out according to law
timely and severe punishments to the plotters, organizers and
behind-the-scenes commanders,'' the official Xinhua News Agency
quoted him as saying in his first public comments since being named
party chief Saturday.
   ``For them, an iota of forgiveness should not be given,'' Jiang
added.
   His comments were in line with his reputation as a political
hard-liner.
   As party boss in Shanghai, China's largest city, he took a strong
stand against political dissent and press freedom that went beyond
limits acceptable to the party.
   Jiang, 62, replaced party chief Zhao Ziyang, who was stripped of
his party posts for expressing sympathy for the student-led
pro-democracy movement.
   The government says fewer than 300 people, half of them soldiers,
were killed when thousands of troops clashed with civilians in the
streets and drove protesters from Tiananmen Square on June 3-4.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports say the death
toll could be as high as 3,000, mostly civilians.
   In assessing China's political agenda, Jiang said an emphasis on
fundamentalist communist ideology ``doesn't mean any change in the
party's policy on intellectuals and the policy of `letting a hundred
flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend.'''
   He was referring to a movement initiated by the late leader Mao
Tse-tung, who in 1957 encouraged philosophical debate. Intellectuals
who spoke out against the party, however, were persecuted and purged.
   Jiang, also known for vigorously promoting economic ties with the
West, said China must push ahead with reforms but distinguish
between socialist-oriented and capitalist-oriented change.
   He also said Beijing would not alter its policies toward Hong
Kong, which reverts to Chinese control in 1997, and Taiwan, with
which China hopes to hold reunification talks.
   Jiang's comments came as China summoned its ambassadors home and
the legislature prepared to convene Thursday to endorse the
government's crackdown on political dissent.
   Embassies in West Germany, Italy, Yugoslavia, the Philippines,
Australia, Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Poland and Belgium were among those
that said their ambassadors had left or would return to Beijing soon.
   Embassy spokesmen in Washington, Moscow and Vienna, however, said
their envoys would remain at their posts.
   Most embassies said the diplomats were returning for ``for
scheduled vacation'' or ``annual home leave.''
   A diplomatic source in Beijing said they would probably meet July
7 for instruction on the government's position on the pro-democracy
movement _ that a small group bent on overthrowing the government
and Communist Party were behind the unrest.
   The envoys also probably will discuss how to stop the rash of
defections by Chinese diplomats overseas, the source said.
   ``We assume they're going to give them the government line, and
tell them to go out and sell it. And stop your people from
defecting,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   More than 20 Chinese diplomats reportedly have asked for
political asylum in North America, Europe and Japan since the
military crackdown began.
   Also on Wednesday, Radio Beijing announced the arrest of Yu
Zhenbing, 27, for forming a ``counterrevolutionary organization'' in
western Qinghai province and spreading anti-government propaganda.
   Since the crackdown began, more than 1,800 people have been
arrested, and the government says it has executed 27 pro-democracy
activists.
   Most of the student leaders wanted by the government have eluded
capture, and one was seen in an emotional videotaped message played
for reporters Wednesday in Hong Kong.
   Student leader Wu'er Kaixi vowed on the videotape to continue his
fight for reforms in hiding.
   ``Those of us who remain alive, our lives no longer belong to
ourselves,'' he said, at times choking back tears. He predicted the
``wild beast,'' China's communist leadership, would fall soon.
   The Communist Party continued to exhort Chinese to learn from a
June 9 speech by senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who praised the
military for quelling the seven-week pro-democracy movement and
urged support for the party. The full text of the speech was
published on on the front pages of newspapers and read on newscasts.
   Radio Beijing said 50 students in rural Shanxi province gave
speeches on Deng's discourse. Some said they had taken part in the
democracy movement but regretted their activities, according to the
report.

<HEAD>North Juror Says She Forgot Her Brother Was Sent to Prison for Armed
Robbery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A juror in the Oliver North trial testified
Wednesday that she gave incorrect background information to the
court because she forgot that her brother had been sent to prison
for armed robbery.
   Tara Leigh King, who was on the panel that convicted North on
three Iran-Contra charges last month, had said ``no'' when asked on
a jury selection form whether ``you or any member of your immediate
family'' had been involved in any court proceeding or investigation.
   ``When I filled this out, I had forgotten about it,'' Miss King
said during a 90-minute hearing.
   North's lawyers had asked for a hearing, saying that her
misstatement ``raises serious questions as to juror bias and
impartiality, and suggests that defendant was deprived of his right
to exercise peremptory and causal challenges in an informed manner.''
   North, a former aide on the National Security Council, was at the
defense table with four of his lawyers, but took no part in the
proceeding.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he will rule Thursday
whether the jury was tainted by the events. His most serious remedy
would be to grant a mistrial.
   North's sentencing had been set for June 23 but was postponed to
July 5 when the juror problem arose. He faces a maximum prison time
of 10 years for aiding and abetting in obstruction of Congress,
destroying or mutilating official documents and accepting a gratuity.
   Miss King said when she filled out the questionnaire on Feb. 1,
she also had not remembered being questioned by detectives,
receiving a subpoena, appearing before the grand jury and about her
mother telling her that her brother was in prison.
   ``I had forgotten about it after I shed tears,'' she said. ``It
stuck with me, but not until the point where he got out.''
   The brother, Samuel King, 51, was in prison from mid-1987 to
mid-1988 for armed robbery.
   In the questioning it was brought out that Samuel and Tara both
lived at home. Miss King said she was one of 15 children, eight boys
and seven girls.
   ``Is it a little embarrassing to talk about this?'' asked Brendan
Sullivan, North's lawyer.
   ``Yes, it is,'' said Miss King.
   She explained that she forgot about Samuel's arrest at
Christmastime 1986. ``It wasn't a nice thing to think about,'' she
said, adding: ``I had a job to go to, I could not let it tear me
down. I had to live my life.''
   Sullivan also brought out that four other brothers had been
involved in criminal matters and that a sister had gone to court in
a child custody suit.
   But Miss King said she had not known anything about any of those.
   Her misstatements on the juror form came to light during an
investigation by North's lawyers. Miss King had been one of the few
jurors to grant extensive interviews to the news media following the
trial and she admitted to having used cocaine until four months
before the trial.
   Gesell said Wednesday's hearing would have been held behind
closed doors had it not been for that.
   ``The reason for the public hearing is that Miss King herself
chose to accept the overtures of the press,'' he said. ``Simply,
start playing this game with the press and you have to play it the
whole way.''
   Like all others chosen for the jury, Miss King said before the
trial that she had not heard, seen or read about North at the time
when he testified before congressional committees in 1987.
   She was asked by prosecutor John Keker whether she had any
preference for or against North when she filled out the
questionnnaire.
   No, said Miss King. ``I was doing what I was asked to do and I
was answering the qestions as good as I could. I had forgotten the
situation about my brothers.''

<HEAD>Indians Offended By State Seal Seek Swordless Alternative</HEAD>

   The Massachusetts state seal with its sword poised
above the head of an Indian and the Latin motto ``By the sword we
seek peace'' has endured for 209 years, but some American Indians
say that's far too long.
   On Wednesday, a group of Wampanoag Indians took the first step
changing the emblem. The Legislature's State Administration
committee unanimously recommended a bill setting up a study
commission on the seal.
   ``The genocide of American Indians has just begun to subside
lately,'' said John Peters of Mashpee, known among his Wampanoag
friends as Slow Turtle. ``We've had to get through a lot of turmoil
just to be survivors. This sword over the Indian's head encourages
that kind of attitude toward us: It's all right to kill Indians.''
   The seal, dating back to 1780 and updated to its present form in
1898, appears on state stationery, legislation, the state flag,
prominent public walls, the cover of the state budget and the back
of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' official chair _ among other places.
   In the center of the seal stands an Indian clad in deerskin and
holding a bow and arrow. A right arm bearing an English broad sword
is poised above the Indian. And the motto, printed in Latin on a
ribbon around the shield, translates: ``By the sword we seek peace,
but peace only under liberty.''
   In completing a modernization of the seal in 1898, anthropologist
Charles Willoughby used the skeleton of an Indian unearthed in
Winthrop, a town just northeast of Boston, for the scale of the
body. A living Indian, Little Shell, of the Ojibway tribe on Lake
Superior, agreed to model for the head. The seal looked much the
same prior to 1898, but different versions were in circulation and
the state wanted a single, authoritative seal.
   A contemporary description of Willoughby's efforts tells of ``red
men'' and ``poor savages.'' The author, E. H. Garrett, writes,
``During the progress of the work of preparing the seal, many people
objected that an Indian did not and should not stand for the state
of Massachusetts.''
   State Rep. Byron Rushing, said the Yankee politicians who
conferred over the seal that year cared little about the American
Indian.
   ``There was a judgment made by a bunch of gentlemen one afternoon
at the Parker House (Hotel) and I'm not sure what they were
drinking,'' said Rushing, a Boston Democrat who is a supporter of
the study commission bill.
   Five members of the Wampanoag tribe wearing street clothes and
Indian jewelry attended Wednesday's legislative hearing and
presented their case for a more sensitive view of the American
Indian.
   If approved by the Legislature, the study commission would
consist of two Senate members, three from the House, three American
Indians and four other appointed or elected officials.
   ``What we want to do here is not to make any radical changes but
to clear up the errors,'' Rushing said.
   One possible alternative proposed by the Wampanoags looks like
the current seal from a distance but depicts a pine tree instead of
a sword over the Indian's head. The Indian is drawn to resemble
Indians who lived in Massachusetts when English settlers first
arrived.
   And in the Indian's hand, instead of a bow and arrow, is a peace
pipe.

   A 36-year-old man who burglarized the U.S.
Consulate in Shanghai four times was executed Wednesday, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Zhang Ping, a self-employed taxi driver, stole goods worth more
than $8,100 from the consulate between October 1986 and February
1988, Xinhua said.
   Zhang, who once served three years in prison for larceny, was
sentenced to death in April, and the Shanghai Higher People's Court
rejected Zhang's appeal June 24, the report said.
   Execution in China is carried out by a pistol shot to the back of
the head. Crimes involving foreigners are generally given harsher
sentences than if they involve Chinese.

   A small, corroded bell plucked from
silt-covered rubble at a depth of 1,500 feet may herald the find of
the richest ship from a Spanish treasure fleet that sank in a
hurricane 350 years ago, salvors said Wednesday.
   ``The pirates are not dead,'' quipped Dan Bagley, part of the
venture which found the ship's bell and put it on display.
   The bronze bell, corroded through on one side, was retrieved by
the crew of the Tampa-based research vessel Seahawk 50 miles off Key
West, where the Nuestra Senora de la Merced was believed to have
gone down during a 1622 hurricane with a load of treasure.
   The bell, eight inches wide and 11 inches tall, is inscribed
under the lip, a marking that researchers hope will identify the
sunken ship. Bagley said it will be sent in the few days to
Florida's state archaeologist, Jim Miller, to examine, test and date.
   ``We don't have any idea what we found. If the bell doesn't tell
us we won't know until we bring up something else,'' said Bagley, a
director of Fox Ridge Capital Corp., parent company of R.V. Seahawk
Inc. and Seahawk Deep Ocean Technology.
   The Merced was believed to have been carrying twice as much
silver, gold and jewels as the Nuestra Senora de la Atocha, which
was found in 1985 nearer Key West by treasure hunter Mel Fisher. He
valued his find at $400 million.
   ``The Merced keeps being brought up because it makes great
headlines,'' Bagley admitted. ``The Merced was the richest ship that
went through there bringing riches to Europe. That's what we hope it
is. We know it's from the same time period. We know it was lost in
deep water. But other ships were lost in deep water too.
   ``We haven't counted our money, yet.''
   The crew of the 85-foot research vessel located and photographed
the bell in April and retrieved it last week with a remote-operated
vehicle carrying a television camera.
   ``It's worth a fortune in history,'' Greg Stemm, a Tampa
advertising firm owner and a partner in the venture, said of the
bell.
   Stemm said the bell will be used to strengthen his company's
federal admiralty claim to the wreck. Admiralty law governs
shipwrecks found in international waters, in this case, more than 12
miles from the U.S. coast.
   Television pictures of the pile of rubble may also provide clues
as to whether it's actually the remains of a 17th-century Spanish
galleon.
   The videos revealed remnants of ship's timbers and olive jars of
the type used by Spaniards to store food and water on sea voyages,
Bagley said.
   Archaeologist Miller viewed the videos of the ship wreck and said
the historical value of the find is significant.
   ``This particular wreck is more like a time capsule. It sank and
it hasn't been touched since that time,'' Miller said.
   By the end of the summer, the salvors will begin to retrieve
artifacts with a remote-operated vehicle being built in Aberdeen,
Scotland.
   So far, they have spotted ballast rock, an object that looks like
a crucifix, circular objects that could be bracelets, and about 50
of the olive jars in the collapsed rubble, which appears to be piled
in a mound about 100 long and 30 feet high, Miller said.
   Stemm, 32, along with Bagley and John Morris, hooked up with
Robert Marx, a treasure hunter and author, who provided the
coordinates for the find. According to Marx, 20 years ago a
fisherman's net pulled up part of one of the jars but the technology
available then was not capable of locating and photographing or
retrieving anything at that depth.
   ``Using his information we first went out with sonar and it
checked out. It looked promising,'' Bagley said.
   ``We could have gone down with grab buckets and brought up the
whole thing. But we abhor that idea. We want to do it right,'' he
said.
   ``We don't want to blow it by just bringing it up,'' Bagley said.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater seemed
to throw President Bush's hat into the 1992 presidential ring on
Wednesday when he declared Bush is ``facing another successful
election and another four-year term.''
   The subject came up as Fitzwater fielded questions on Bush's
support for a constitutional amendment to forbid flag burning.
   What other constitutional amendents did Bush favor? Fitzwater
rattled them off: balanced budget, line-item veto and a ban on
abortions.
   Fitzwater was asked: What is Bush's position on former President
Reagan's campaign to win repeal of the 22nd Amendment, which limits
presidential service to two four-year terms?
   ``I've not heard his comment, but an incumbent president can't
really take a position on the 22nd. ... George Bush is facing
another successful election and another four-year term.''
   When did Bush, who took office Jan. 20, announce his intention to
seek re-election?
   ``January 21st,'' Fitzwater joked.

<HEAD>Testimony in Ochoa Case Indicates Cuban Involvement in Venezuela</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Testimony in the case of a Cuban military hero who
confessed to smuggling drugs, ivory and diamonds hinted at
involvement by Fidel Castro's communist government in a secret
operation in Venezuela.
   Several witnesses told a military tribunal Maj. Gen. Arnaldo
Ochoa had been an ``internacionalista'' in Venezuela.
   ``Internacionalista'' is a term Cubans use to describe someone
willing to fight anywhere in the world for the ideals of Castro's
communist revolution.
   Ochoa, 57, is believed to have served with a team of military
advisers to Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government in addition to
commanding Cuban troops in Angola and Ethiopia.
   This was the first mention of his name in connection with
Venezuela. Witnesses at the tribunal _ six of eight other officers
arrested earlier this month along with Ochoa _ gave no details and
did not say when his Venezuelan mission occurred.
   Also arrested were Brig. Gen. Patricio de la Guardia Font and his
twin, Col. Antonio de la Guardia Font; Ochoa's assistant, Capt.
Jorge Martinez; Cols. Teudys Trutie Matilla, Antonio Rodriguez
Estupinan and Rafael Morales Velazquez; Lt. Col. Arnaldo Morejon
Plat, and Capt. Jose Llicas Papadedis.
   The military tribunal took testimony only against Ochoa in
hearings Sunday and Monday. The members recommended he be
court-martialed for high treason and, if found guilty, executed by a
firing squad.
   They said Ochoa, decorated for his service as a field commander
in Angola in 1987-1988, had damaged Cuba's reputation and threatened
its national security.
   Defense Minister Raul Castro, Fidel's brother, said Ochoa's
punishment should ``set an example.''
   Witnesses said the general was in league with Colombian drug
smugglers and had helped turn Cuba into a Caribbean stop for
U.S.-bound cocaine.
   An official announcement said the 45 generals and colonels, one
admiral and one rear admiral on the tribunal were unanimous in
recommending the court-martial and ``almost unanimous'' on the death
penalty.
   Videotapes of the hearings were broadcast on state television for
more than six hours until 1 a.m. Wednesday.
   No scenes were shown of testimony by the de la Guardia twins,
although some newscasters said Patricio testified Sunday. There was
no explanation of the omission.
   Castro ordered the investigation that led to the arrests,
according to the official news agency Prensa Latina. Some of those
arrested worked for the Interior Ministry, which is in charge of
internal security.
   Some witnesses confessed their own involvement with the drug,
diamond and ivory traffic, and described hiding money in
refrigerators and under cement slabs in backyards. Nearly all said
their purpose was to help Cuba with its economic problems.
   In his last statement to the court, Ochoa said: ``If this
sentence should come to pass, I want you to know that my last
thought will be for Fidel and the great revolution he has given our
country.''
   He was asked by Ulises Rosales del Toro, president of the court,
whether he had sought to challenge Castro's power or policies, and
replied: ``Of course there is nothing to that. I have never been
opposed to the revolution.''

   The government's milk price support will be cut
sharply on July 1, removing a temporary increase ordered by Congress
last year to help drought-stricken milk producers, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced Wednesday.
   Congress specified in the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 that
milk price supports be boosted 50 cents per 100 pounds from April 1
through June 30. That put the basic support price at $11.10 per
hundredweight. Effective July 1, the support will revert back to the
$10.60 level.
   The National Milk Producers Federation had estimated the
three-month boost of 50 cents per hundredweight provided an
additional $300 million in revenues for dairy farmers.

<TEXT>
   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, a key U.S.
ally, rejected allegations Wednesday that his government abuses
human rights, saying he has the support of 100 percent of his people.
   ``I'm sure that you know that in Zaire I enjoy the support of 100
percent of the population,'' Mobuto told reporters after a lengthy
meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III. ``Therefore, I
would not victimize my own supporters.''
   The meeting marked the beginning of the African leader's official
visit, which includes a Thursday meeting with President Bush.
   Baker praised Mobutu for his role in helping arrange a cease-fire
that began last week in Angola's 14-year-old civil war. The
breakthrough occurred at an 18-nation summit at which Mobutu was the
host.
   The United States and Zaire have enjoyed close ties for most of
Mobutu's 24-year rule. Zaire has received substantial U.S.
assistance while serving as a transit point for U.S. military
supplies destined for anti-communist rebels in neighboring Angola.
   But Mobutu has been dogged for years by allegations that his
government is corrupt and repressive.
   ``He continues to run the world's pre-eminent `kleptocracy,'''
said Randall Robinson, head of the liberal lobbying group
TransAfrica.
   Robinson alleged that Mobutu has ``siphoned enough funds from
public accounts to private accounts in Switzerland to liquidate the
entire national debt of Zaire.''
   A State Department document cited in a New York Times story two
years ago estimated Mobutu's wealth at more than $5 billion.
   Freedom House, a New York-based group that promotes democracy
around the world, ranks Zaire among the worst human rights violators
in Africa.
   The annual State Department human rights report, released in
February, cited torture and other physical mistreatment of detainees
as the most significant human rights abuses in Zaire.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday
that Mobutu has taken steps to correct such abuses.
   ``Human rights problems and deficiencies are part of our ongoing
dialogue with Zaire,'' Boucher said.
   Concern over human rights in Zaire is expected to lead to a
cutback in U.S. military aid to Zaire from $9 million to $3 million
in fiscal 1990.

<HEAD>Indictments in PLO Arms Supply to Red Brigades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior PLO official and four former
Italian military officers were indicted Wednesday in connection with
the alleged supply of PLO arms to the Red Brigades in 1979, the ANSA
news agency reported.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who had been under investigation in
the affair, was absolved of any involvement by Venice magistrate
Carlo Mastelloni, the report said.
   ANSA said among those indicted was Salah Khalaf, a top member of
Fatah, the mainstream Arafat-led faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The agency said Mastelloni indicted four former officials of
SISMI, the secret service wing of the Italian military. They were
identified as Gen. Gino Lugaresi, Gen. Pasquale Notarnicola, Col.
Armando Sportelli and Marshal Giuseppe Agricola.
   Also indicted were six Italians who worked or studied at a
language school in Paris and allegedly served as contacts between
Red Brigades terrorists and Palestinians in the French capital, ANSA
said.
   The agency did not specify the charges in the indictment or give
further details. Mastelloni's office was closed Wednesday night.
   Mastelloni has been investigating alleged links between the Red
Brigades and the PLO for years. The investigation grew out of
statements by Red Brigades terrorists-turned-informers who said the
PLO supplied a shipment of arms, including 150 Sterling machine
guns, delivered by yacht from Lebanon to Venice in September 1979.
   The PLO has consistently denied any ties with the Red Brigades,
who have been effectively crushed in recent years by Italian
authorities.

<HEAD>Efforts to Streamline Nuclear Licensing Suffer Setback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts by nuclear power supporters to simplify
and shorten reactor licensing suffered a major setback Wednesday in
the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   By a vote of 22-20, the panel voted to omit from a Nuclear
Regulatory Commission budget bill a provision that would have
allowed a utility to get both a construction permit and an operating
license at the same time.
   Under current law, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must hold
hearings after construction is complete on whether to grant an
operating license.
   A major streamling of commission rules that took effect last
month limits the issues that can be raised in hearings on an
operating license, but without legislation the commission may not do
away with that step.
   The industry believes the new commission rules will not amount to
the simplification the commission expects, and will not do enough to
remove uncertainty.
   The industry has complained for years that the two-stage process
takes too much time and causes too much financial risk, since the
second hearing opens the door to last-minute challenges that can
kill plants that already are completed.
   Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., earlier this month narrowly
won an Energy and Commerce subcommittee vote to attach his one-stage
licensing amendment to the NRC spending bill for the 1990 fiscal
year that starts Oct. 1.
   The proposal was killed, however, in Wednesday's vote by the full
committee. The panel was scheduled to continue debate on the
spending bill Thursday.
   Lando W. Zech, the NRC chairman, told a news conference Wednesday
at commission headquarters that he still believes the rule has set
the stage for getting nuclear plants built in six years or less.
That is about half the time required currently.
   Zech, who is retiring from the commission on Friday, cited the
rule as one of the most important accomplishments of his three years
as head of the agency. He is completing five years on the
commission, following a 42-year career in the Navy.
   He said he was confident that an 11-year hiatus in new orders for
nuclear plants would end, and that public concerns about safety
would be overcome.
   ``Nuclear power plants are safer today than they ever have
been,'' he said.
   Zech will be replaced as chairman by Kenneth Carr, who has served
on the commission since 1986. Zech, who turns 66 on Thursday, said
he was unsure of his future plans.

   A drought emergency measure to permit hay

Conservation Reserve Program has been expanded, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   Effective immediately, qualifying farmers in counties where a
livestock emergency has been determined to exist may cut hay from
``permanent wildlife habitat'' acres enrolled in the program,
officials said.
   ``Haying may not be closer than 20 feet to shrubs or trees
established as part of the habitat practice and is subject to the
earlier provision that at least 25 percent of the field much be left
undisturbed for wildlife cover,'' the department said.
   Haying of alfalfa used for temporary cover was also authorized,
providing the ground is prepared immediately for planting permanent
cover at the next normal opportunity for seeding.

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remnants of Tropical Storm Allison
flooded hundreds of homes Wednesday in southern Louisiana and
whipped up tornado-force winds that injured five people in
Mississippi.
   Almost 10 inches of rain fell in the Baton Rouge area Tuesday
night and Wednesday morning and 3 to 6 inches more rain was expected.
   ``I don't know what to expect. This is the most rain that's
fallen in this short a period of time that I can remember,'' said
Ralph Stassi, 50-year-old chief deputy of the Iberville Parish
Sheriff's Office in Plaquemine, south of Baton Rouge.
   Allison came ashore Monday in Texas and was blamed for four
deaths in that state. More than a foot of rain fell in some spots
and authorities estimated damages could approach $1 billion in the
Houston area alone.
   Louisiana and Mississippi continued to take a pounding from what
was left of the storm Wednesday while Texas began to dry out.
   Creeks and bayous rose throughout the day. Several were already
above flood stage in Louisiana by mid-afternoon and authorities told
people near the Calcasieu, Whisky Chitto and Mermentau rivers as
well as Bayou Nezpique to prepare to move to higher ground.
   Several communities reported flooded homes. Plaquemine was one of
the hardest hit with as many as 280 homes flooded. Two trailer parks
were evacuated, Iberville Parish officials said.
   In Baton Rouge, flash flooding was reported in several areas of
town. In one subdivision near the Louisiana State University campus,
2 to 3 feet of water covered some streets and homeowners waded
through their living rooms.
   Edward Wright, assistant director of emergency management for the
city-parish government in Baton Rouge, said at least 100 homes were
flooded.
   ``Our drainage system is not the best,'' said Wright, ``and that
much rain in that short a period of time really tests it.''
   Power failures were reported in several areas, including the LSU
campus, where classes were canceled.
   In Mississippi, several homes were damaged or destroyed when
tornado-force winds ripped into the Centreville area, authorities
said. Five people were injured but not seriously, said a spokesman
at Field Memorial Hospital said.
   Before the tornado destroyed a house next door, ``We were
remarking on how strange the weather looked,'' said Sue Havard,
co-owner of Rollins Timber Co. just outside the Centreville city
limits. ``Instead of the leaves being blown down, they were being
sucked up into the air.''
   In Amite County, Miss., authorities said an apparent tornado
struck southwest of Liberty, damaging farm buildings and a house at
a dairy farm. No injuries were reported.
   On Tuesday, the storm, downgraded to a tropical depression, spun
off tornadoes in opposite corners of Louisiana. In the morning, the
town of Hackberry in southwestern Louisiana was hit and two mobile
homes were overturned. Eight funnel clouds were sighted around
Monroe in northeastern Louisiana and homes along a 100-mile path
were damaged but no serious injuries were reported.
   In Texas, dozens of families along the San Jacinto River east of
Houston remained out of their flooded homes Wednesday. In addition,
many side roads, particularly in the eastern part of the city and
Harris County, remained flooded.
   The storm also caused considerable beach erosion _ perhaps 20 to
30 yards _ on the west end of Galveston Island and on the Bolivar
Peninsula across from Galveston, where sand dunes were pushed over a
highway, weather officials said.
   Several rivers in eastern Texas remained over flood stage.
   Allison became the first named storm of the 1989 Atlantic
hurricane season when its highest sustained wind speed reached 39
mph. The National Weather Service said the highest gusts clocked
were 56 mph at Galveston and 53 mph at Houston Intercontinental
Airport.

<TEXT>
   A top El Salvadoran defense official told Vice
President Dan Quayle on Wednesday that President Alfredo Cristiani
will establish a human rights commission in that strife-torn country.
   Rene Emilio Ponce, chief of staff of El Salvador's armed forces,
disclosed the plans in a meeting with Quayle at the White House.
   Quayle spokesman David Beckwith said Ponce informed the vice
president that the commission will be composed of three independent
citizens with a mandate to ensure that the government, including the
military, respects human rights.
   Ponce is considered a leading candidate to become defense
minister in El Salvador under the new, conservative Cristiani
admnistration after the current caretaker minister completes a
six-month term.
   Quayle visited El Salvador last month on his second Central
American trip and admonished right-wing leaders there, including
Cristiani associate Roberto d'Aubuisson, to avoid human rights
abuses.
   Quayle told reporters at the outset of his meeting with Ponce
that he stands by his message of wanting to see ``no embarrassments
to the Cristiani government.''
   ``Let's not have any kind of overreaction to the brutal killings
that have been going (by) the FMLN in El Salvador,'' he said.
   The FMLN was trying to overthrow the government even before
Cristiani's party came to power. It is blamed for several recent
assassinations, including the killing of El Salvador's attorney
general and Jose Antonio Rodriquez Porth, Cristiani's chief of staff.
   Quayle said he met with both right- and left-wing politicians in
El Salvador because he wanted to reach ``as wide a political
spectrum as possible.''
   Some Democrats in Congress have criticized Quayle for meeting
with d'Aubuisson. But Quayle said his critics have been silent about
the killings by the left.
   ``It's a total one-way street and certainly something I don't
accept,'' said Quayle.
   ``They have very narrow minds when it comes to the enforcement of
human rights _ only on one side. We're taking human rights across
the board,'' he said.
   According to Beckwith, Quayle told Ponce the Salvadoran military
has made great progress on its human rights record, and praised it
for refusing to respond to the violent provocations by the FMLN.

<TEXT>
   A Hispanic child is born into poverty in the
United States every 3{ minutes, according to a report by a Latino
advocacy group that says the needs of these people are overlooked by
federal policy-makers.
   The report by the National Association of Latino Elected and
Appointed Officials released this week said 39.4 percent of all
Hispanic children were living in poverty, $11,611 for a family of
four, in 1987.
   ``Moreover, the increasing growth of the Hispanic population, a
community which has increased by 30 percent from 1980 to 1987, in
addition to the relative youth of the community, compounds an
already alarming situation,'' the report said. ``Simply stated,
significant numbers of Hispanic children constitute a population at
risk.''
   While Hispanic children comprise approximately 10 percent of all
children in the United States, they represent 27 percent of all
children in poverty, the report said.
   ``Yet the unique needs of Hispanic children in poverty continue
to be overlooked by the nation's federal policy-makers, civil
affairs researchers, and the media,'' the report said.
   The nation's Hispanic population jumped from 14.3 million in 1980
to 17.5 million in 1985 through a combination of high birth rates
and international migration, according to Census Bureau estimates
released last week.
   Although they were only 6.3 percent of the U.S. population in
1980, Hispanics made up about one-fourth of the 12 million national
population increase during the next half-decade, the Census Bureau
said.
   Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-Texas, said he believes the poverty
rate for Hispanic children could exceed 40 percent in many areas.
   Bustamante said today's Hispanic children will make up one-third
of the work force in the 21st century, but he is concerned they will
not have the skills and education needed to provide the services and
taxes the country will need as the population ages.
   NALEO's report is based is based on the First National Conference
on Latino Children in Poverty, held in July 1987 and sponsored by
the NALEO Education Fund. Attending were university researchers,
public policy-makers and service providers.

   The Defense Department continued to discipline
errant contractors at a near-record pace in the first half of fiscal
1989, excluding 307 companies or individuals from bidding on
military work.
   The bidding rights of another 325 contractors were temporarily
suspended because of wrongdoing.
   The 307 debarments fell five short of the six-month record of 312
established during the second half of fiscal 1988.
   The figures were released Wednesday in the latest semi-annual
report to Congress by the Pentagon's inspector general. It covers
Oct. 1, 1988, to March 31.
   Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said investigators ``conducted
significant fraud investigations on matters like defective pricing,
product substitution and false claims.''
   ``Those efforts to curb defective and substandard products,
conspiracy and labor cost mischaring resulted in monetary recoveries
of $258 million,'' she said in the report.
   The inspector general maintains a staff of auditors and
investigators who operate outside the control of top Pentagon
executives. The office was created in 1983.
   The report, dated May 30, discloses that auditors issued more
than 26,000 new contract audits involving $124 billion worth of work
during the six-month period. The auditors either disallowed or saved
for other uses more than $2.2 billion through the audits, the report
said.
   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers auditors saved an estimated $6.7
million by challenging questionable awards or future contracting
plans, and Pentagon auditors saved another $484.3 million through
follow-up audits aimed at completing cases that led to management
disputes over the auditor's recommendations, the report said.
   The Justice Department obtained 455 indictments on behalf of the
Pentagon during the period, in addition to 43 indictments at the
local, state or foreign level and 258 recommendations for
courts-martial.
   Among some of the more significant actions cited during the
period was a settlement with the Sundstrand Corp. of a false claims
and illegal gratuities case that resulted in a $115 million fine and
$62.3 million in administrative settlement payments.

   A state appeals court Wednesday upheld
Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose's bid to stave off a hearing
before baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, setting up a
possible court fight between the two.
   The 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals gave Rose his second legal
victory in four days, deciding it had no authority to nullify an
order that temporarily blocks Giamatti from holding a hearing to
decide Rose's fate.
   Giamatti is still barred from holding a hearing on allegations
that Rose bet on his own team and from taking any action against the
manager for two weeks.
   Another hearing is scheduled July 6 before Hamilton County Common
Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel for a preliminary injunction, which
would extend Rose's protection while the case is prepared for trial.
   If baseball can't block the July 6 hearing, Giamatti will appear
before Nadel to try to convince the judge he is wrong, baseball
lawyer Louis L. Hoynes Jr. said.
   ``The commissioner will certainly be a witness for us,'' Hoynes
said. ``It's important for us, for him, to be here, and he will be
here.''
   In an unpredecented ruling, Nadel decided last Sunday that
Giamatti has prejudged Rose as guilty, and concluded a hearing
before the commissioner would be pointless. Giamatti can suspend
Rose for life if he determines the manager bet on his own team.
   Giamatti said Wednesday that the appeals court didn't decide
whether Nadel was correct in his assessment, but had concluded it
had no authority to act. Giamatti has said he hasn't yet decided
Rose's fate.
   ``They didn't affirm Judge Nadel's finding about me. They just
decided they couldn't decide,'' Giamatti said.
   Hoynes gave no indication of baseball's next legal move, which
could turn to the Ohio Supreme Court.
   Although Rose is unbeaten in the state courts, evidence supplied
by his accusers to baseball could give him trouble with federal
authorities.
   Rose also is being investigated by a federal grand jury in
Cincinnati looking into whether he listed all his income on his tax
returns.
   Testimony in baseball's report on Rose alleges he purposely hid
income from the Internal Revenue Service from race track wagers,
memorabilia sales and public appearances _ offenses that carry the
threat of jail and fines.

   Barbara Bush called it a ``red-letter day,''
but the emphasis was on green Wednesday as she became the 14th
consecutive first lady to serve as honorary president of Girl Scouts
of the U.S.A.
   A hundred Girl Scouts of all ages filled the East Room of the
White House for the investiture ceremony, which began with Mrs. Bush
summoning forth two aides to ``be my props.''
   Down the aisle came chief of staff Susan Porter Rose and staff
member Julia Cooke, both wearing the familiar green sash from their
own scouting days.
   ``You might think I use scout involvement as a criterion for
hiring if you look at the members of my staff,'' said Mrs. Bush.
   ``I'm realy sort of kidding ... but it wouldn't be such a bad
idea, would it?'' she said.
   Mrs. Bush was following a tradition started by Mrs. Woodrow
Wilson in 1917, five years after the Girl Scouts were founded. Today
it counts 2.3 million American girls and 706,000 adults among its
members.
   Mrs. Bush extolled ``the enormous benefits of growing up in this
outstanding organization,'' which includes one in every nine
American girls.
   ``Scouting builds confidence, compassion and self-esteem as no
other experience can. The girl Scout promise _ `Service to God,
Country and Other People' _ prepares millions of women to build
productive lives and contribute so richly to our national
well-being,'' said Mrs. Bush.
   She called it a historic day and ``surely a red-letter day for
me.''
   After getting a membership pin and gold bar from Betty F.
Pilsbury, the scouts' national president, Mrs. Bush joined her
troops in reciting the Girl Scout promise, then repaired down the
hall to the State Room for refreshments.

<HEAD>Bush Gets Bill to Extend Strategic Petroleum Reserve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved and sent to President Bush
Wednesday a limited nine-month extension of the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve as the nation's energy lifejacket in the event of another
oil embargo.
   The Senate last week bowed to House demands for a limited
extension, temporarily giving up its plan to expand the reserve's
capacity from 750 million barrels of oil to 1 million barrels by
early in the next century.
   As approved by voice vote in both houses, the legislation now
authorizes the Energy Department to continue filling the reserve
with 60,000 to 78,000 barrels of oil daily only through next March.
   Without the bill's passage, the president's authority to draw
upon the stockpile in order to counter a dramatic upsurge in oil
prices from an embargo or other supply disruption would have expired
June 30.
   Under current law, Bush can use the stockpile only in the event
of a disruption in oil imports.
   The Senate would have expanded his authority to draw it down also
if domestic supplies are interrupted, such as when oil prices shot
up dramatically after Exxon Valdez tanker spill off Alaska this
spring.
   Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the House energy and power
subcommittee, said that issue along with new proposals for financing
the reserve, such as leasing the oil from foreign suppliers rather
than buying it, will be studied during the next nine months.
   The government has spent some $6 billion on building the reserve
since it was begun in 1975 in response to an Arab oil embargo two
years earlier.
   It now has some 570 million barrels _ slightly less than a 90-day
supply of U.S. imports at current levels _ stored in salt caverns
along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.

   President Daniel Ortega
denied Wednesday that his government ordered President Jose Azcona
Hoyo and three other leaders killed in neighboring Honduras, as a
Nicaraguan deserter claims.
   ``This man is crazy. I wouldn't even want to think that he is
being manipulated by the Honduran government or the gringos
(Americans). This is madness,'' Ortega told The Associated Press.
   Orlando Solorzano Martinez said in Tegucigalpa that the leftist
Sandinista government sent him to Honduras nine months ago to
assassinate Azcona, Roman Catholic Archbishop Hector Enrique Santos
of Tegucigalpa, and presidential candidates Rafael Leonardo Callejas
of the opposition National Party and Carlos Flores Facusse of the
governing Liberal Party.
   Ortega briefly answered questions on a visit he made to this town
near Managua, where he gave 200 peasant families title deeds to
plots of farmland.
   Solorzano spoke at a news conference Tuesday in San Pedro Sula, a
port city 125 miles north of Tegucigalpa, where he is staying.
   He said he and two other military officers entered Honduras in
1988 on a ``secret mission ordered by the Nicaraguan high command .
.. to assassinate political and military leaders in this country.''
   Solorzano said that instead he deserted because he was ``tired of
the corruption and degeneration by the communists in power in my
country.''
   Nicaragua's foreign Minister, Miguel d'Escoto, meanwhile told a
news conference in The Hague, Netherlands, on Wednesday that the
outlook for an early peace settlement in Central America was ``not
... promising.'' He said U.S.-sponsored military in the region were
blocking such an agreement.
   D'Escoto said the civilian presidents of some Central American
nations ``are hostages of the military ... and limited in what they
can do and how far they can go.''
   But he said Nicaragua was going ahead with general elections
scheduled for next year, and that the Sandinistas were ready to
yield power if defeated.
   He said his government ``definitely'' wanted better relations
with the Bush administration, adding: ``We told them that we were
waiting at the (negotiating) table ... but so far, I see no
indications for improvement yet.''
   D'Escoto said Washington still supported Honduras-based rebels
fighting the Managua government despite a 1986 World Court ruling
banning such support.
   D'Escoto was in The Hague to attend a foreign ministers'
conference of the movement of non-aligned countries.

   Through all the twists of glasnost, one figure in
Soviet history has stood above criticism: Vladimir Ilych Lenin. But
an official magazine now has breached that taboo with a vehement
attack on the man who led the communists to power in Russia.
   ``Lenin _ all victories of the party and the state are linked
with the name of Lenin,'' wrote Vasily Grossman in a work published
posthumously in the June issue of the Oktyabr literary magazine.
``But all cruelty committed in the country has become the tragic
burden of Vladimir Ilych.''
   Grossman charges that Soviet political terror and dictatorship
were begun by Lenin and not by his successor, Josef Stalin, as
Communist Party doctrine has maintained since 1956.
   By printing the Ukrainian-born writer's short novel ``Forever
Flowing'' in the Soviet Union for the first time, the monthly
implicitly questions President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's often-stated
view that the nation needs only to shake off the totalitarian
heritage of Stalinism and return to true Leninist ways to construct
a democracy in which the liberty of each citizen is respected.
   ``Bolsheviks did not believe in the value of personal freedom,
freedom of speech and press,'' wrote Grossman. ``They, like Lenin
himself, considered those freedoms which were a dream for many
revolutionary workers and intelligentsia as ... insignificant.''
   Soviet writers, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn, often have used
the novel form to comment on real issues.
   ``Forever Flowing'' was published in Frankfurt in 1970, six years
after Grossman's death. It apparently circulated earlier in the
Soviet Union as part of the genre of underground literature known as
``samizdat.''
   Lenin, who steered the Bolsheviks to power in the 1917 Russian
Revolution, was elevated to near divine status by the Kremlin
following his death in 1924. His writings and thought have served
since as a touchstone and bible for Communists, Gorbachev among them.
   The Soviet founder's preserved body lies in a shrine-like
mausoleum at the Kremlin wall, and people lining up daily to wait
their turn for a glimpse at the remains have worn a path across the
the cobblestones of Red Square.
   Lenin's words are cited as gospel by Kremlin leaders as well as
state agencies and propaganda organs. The in-flight brochures of
Aeroflot, the state airline, stress Lenin's enthusiasm for aviation.
   In ``Forever Flowing,'' Grossman portrays a Lenin at odds with
the official heroic portrait, a man who may even have had a paunch
because of a love for buttered macaroni. More importantly,
Grossman's Lenin is a political fanatic who would sooner exterminate
his enemies than try to persuade them.
   ``Lenin's intolerance, unshakable aspiration to achieve a goal,
contempt for freedom and cruelty to those who thought differently,
his ability to remove from the earth whole regions, areas, which did
not comply with his orthodox rightness _ all those features were not
added to Lenin's character by the revolution, they go much deeper,
into Lenin's youth,'' wrote Grossman, who died in 1964.
   ``Lenin didn't try to find the truth in discussions, but to
win,'' Grossman said. ``When debates were transferred from the pages
of newspapers and magazines into the streets, battlefields and
wheatfields, it was realized that all cruel means were useful and
good.''
   Grossman's accusations are strong stuff even given the criticism
of other Soviet historical figures that has appeared under
Gorbachev's campaign for ``glasnost,'' or more openness. In a
foreword to ``Forever Flowing,'' Grigory G. Vodolazov takes issue
with Grossman's ``identification of Lenin with Stalin'' but defends
Grossman's right to write as he pleased.
   ``Under socialist pluralism, V. Grossman and those who think
along his lines have the legal right to express themselves,'' wrote
Vodolazov, a member of the editorial board of the party theoretical
journal Problems of Peace and Socialism. ``The mere existence of
their opinions, their search for answers serve the highest and most
noble purposes.''
   If Vodolazov's view is now official doctrine, it would extend
glasnost's range beyond the hazy boundaries that so far have
preserved a measure of immunity for Lenin _ and for Gorbachev
himself. Since all Soviet policy claims to be ``Leninist,''
criticizing Lenin is casting doubt on the Soviet present and past
since the establishment of Soviet power itself.
   Perhaps Grossman's most damning accusation is that Lenin paved
the way for the centralized police state constructed by Stalin and
his nationwide campaigns of political terror that led to the deaths
of millions.
   ``Things inherited from Lenin, like revolutionary dictatorship,
terror and the struggle against bourgeois freedoms, which Lenin
viewed as temporary, were used by Stalin for building a foundation
... (and) became a whole with the traditional, national lack of
freedom in Russia,'' Grossman wrote.
   Gorbachev, other party officials and communist doctrine have
maintained that Stalin was not the heir to Lenin's work but its
perverter. An article last year in another literary monthly, Novy
Mir, said Lenin justified the use of terror and made errors in his
early economic policy, but that he realized he was wrong and thus
merits praise.
   Grossman's masterwork, a novel about World War II titled ``Life
and Fate,'' also challenged a central tenet of Soviet orthodoxy by
equating Nazism and Soviet communism.
   The novel was so sensitive that the KGB confiscated Grossman's
manuscript in 1961, along with the carbon paper and typewriter
ribbons he used to write it. Like ``Forever Flowing,'' ``Life and
Fate'' was first published in the Soviet Union by Oktyabr.

   The House Agriculture Committee was urged
Wednesday not to let the 1990 farm bill wait on the conclusion of
international trade talks.
   The legislation that will shape federal agriculture policy for
four or five years is in the information-gathering stage and will
not be crafted for many months, said Chairman Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas.
   During what de la Garza described as an ``open mike'' session,
members of Congress who are not on the committee and two governors
offered suggestions for the new bill.
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner noted the Bush administration's
efforts to abolish export subsidies worldwide during ongoing
international trade negotiations under the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs, or GATT.
   Earlier, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter had even suggested
that the 1985 farm law be extended until the trade talks are
finished, as they assuredly would affect farm exports.
   But Sinner opposed tying the legislation to the trade talks.
   ``Whatever the outcome of GATT, our 1990 farm bill must provide
strong government support for U.S. agriculture,'' said Sinner, who
also is chairman of the National Governor's Association committee on
agriculture and rural development. ``Those policies put in place by
Congress should not be erased by the GATT negotiators.''
   He said he would like to see export subsidies, like the Export
Enhancement Program used in the United States stopped, ``but only
multilaterally.''
   He also called for a solution to the volatile exchange rate,
affecting sales prices.
   ``If there is no other way, we should adopt a policy using a
10-year moving average for an exchange rate base and correcting
deviations from that 10-year moving average with a tariff,'' he said.
   As for crop reserves, Sinner questioned whether the United States
should continue to hold two-thirds of the world's reserves.
   ``The answer is, `No way,''' said Sinner. ``That's one thing GATT
must work on.''
   Sinner said that the decision in 1985 farm law to freeze program
payment yields has caused hardship for many young farmers and
created a land market that is driven by a acreage bases rather than
the inherent quality of the land.
   ``Many young or expanding farmers are suffering from their
inability to prove yields during the past few years,'' he said. ``It
is important to allow proving of yields again and to coordinate
proven yields for federal crop insurance. This will make the system
more equitable.''
   Sinner also said the government needs to figure out what to do
with the land in the Conservation Reserve Program.
   ``Federal agency takeover of lands has gotten out of hand in the
West, at least,'' he said. ``A better private-public reward system
is far more desirable.''
   Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden said farmers need more flexibility and
suggested that the government look at a farmer's total acreage of
all crops in determining how much should be held out for
conservation purposes.
   ``The U.S. Department of Agriculture should allow the planting of
industrial non-food crops on set-aside acres so produces can test
these crops without being penalized under current farm programs,''
he said.

   A father and son separated since birth
were reunited after 19 years, but the circumstances of their
surprise meeting were less than ideal _ both men were behind bars.
   Robert Arthur Magoon was in custody for allegedly violating his
parole and his father, Michael Arthur Magoon, was being held on
robbery charges at the Santa Clara County jail.
   He also has warrants pending out of Oakland for investigation of
felony child stealing.
   ``When I first came here, they said, `Do you have a relative
here?''' said Robert, 19. ``I said, `Not that I know of.' ... At
first, I thought it couldn't be possible. For all I knew, he could
have been on the other side of the world.''
   Robert was separated from his father when his parents split up
shortly after he was born. He spent most of his youth in foster
homes. He ran away from the last one at age 14.
   ``I tried to look for him,'' said Robert. ``I tried going to the
(Department of Motor Vehicles) and other places. They just didn't
have any information.''
   Michael also said he tried looking for his long-lost son and had
no idea he was in a foster home.
   Robert, of Modesto, was arrested by police in Santa Clara early
this month and put in jail for allegedly violating his parole from
the California Youth Authority, where he said he served time as a
juvenile for a burglary.
   Michael, meanwhile, lives in Texas but had been arrested by
police in Santa Clara about two months earlier and booked into the
same jail.
   A few jail guards helped the two learn they were in the same
jail, and Michael approached Sgt. Virgil King last week to ask if he
could see his son.
   ``It was a request that was not impossible to accomplish,''said
King. ``I have a motto: It's that you treat people, even though
they're in custody, the way you'd like to be treated.''
   King, who investigated the accounts and found them to be
accurate, set up a meeting for the father and son.
   The two men said they were nervous and excited before their
reunion. They shook hands, hugged and then sat down for their first
talk.
   ``He really surprises me,'' said Michael after the meeting.
``He's so handsome. Tears come to my eyes when I see my boy.''
   Robert said his father told him he wants him to come live with
him in Texas, where he is an auto painter. His father wants to teach
him the trade. Robert also got some advice from his father.
   ``He told me to keep my nose clean,'' recalled Robert.
   Robert also has an older brother neither he nor his father have
seen in years. They both hope to reunite with him, too.
   In the meantime, the father and son are making plans to spend
time together when they are both free.
   ``If we could just get together some day, everything would turn
out right,'' Michael said.
   It could be a while before the two get together.
   Robert is serving a sentence for attempted extortion and will not
be released from jail until July 20. He will then be turned over to
the California Youth Authority.
   Michael has a July 10 trial date in connection with charges of
robbery, petty theft and a weapons violation.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh opposes the
idea of requiring gun buyers to obtain a national identification
card, one of several options outlined by a Justice Department task
force, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   The requirement would be ``an infringement on rights of
Americans,'' said David Runkel, adding that the attorney general
won't recommend that option to President Bush.
   Under the task force suggestion, published this week as part of a
gun-control study, each person who buys a gun would be required to
first obtain a firearms owner's identification card valid for three
years. The study estimated that as many as 5 million cards would be
issued annually.
   An applicant would wait four weeks to six weeks after being
photographed and fingerprinted while police determine if the
individual has been convicted of a felony.
   Thornburgh opposed a similar idea in the 1970s when he headed the
Justice Department's criminal division, Runkel said.
   The identification-card option was one of several ways the task
force offered to prevent felons from obtaining weapons. The task
force didn't recommend any one of the options it suggested.
   The study also noted that criminals would be able to obtain
weapons on the black market even if an effective screening system
could be devised.
   Thornburgh is required by Congress to propose a screening system
by Nov. 18, but won't review the options until a public comment
period ends in September, Runkel said.
   Another option in the 40-page report, published Monday in the
Federal Register, would require the nation's 270,000 gun dealers to
call local police before selling a weapon to determine if the
purchaser has a criminal record.
   There are an estimated 7.5 million gun sales each year.
   Requiring identity cards would force the FBI to hire 1,700
additional clerks to check fingerprints. The system would cost
federal, state and local governments $136 million to $161 million a
year, which could be financed by a user fee of $27 to $32, the study
said.
   Federal law doesn't require checks of those who want to buy guns.
Twenty states, as well as the District of Columbia, require checks
of the buyer's criminal history.
   The task-force study was mandated by Congress last year. Rep.
Bill McCollum, R-Fla., proposed the measure to head off a bill
requiring a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers.
   McCollum's measure was seen by many as an effort by the National
Rifle Association to stall gun control by requiring further study.

   Thunderstorms associated with the remains of Tropical Storm
Allison spread heavy rain across the lower Mississippi Valley on
Wednesday, and a band of rain weather extended from that region to
New England.
   Baton Rouge, La., had received more than 11 inches of rain in two
days. The Houston area got over a foot of rain from the storm.
   Numerous roads were closed in the Baton Rouge area and
surrounding parishes and at least 100 homes were flooded.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
2.53 inches at Cape Girardeau, Mo., and 2.51 inches at Baton Rouge.
Paducah, Ky., got 3.57 inches of rain in 3 hours during the morning.
   Showers and thunderstorms developing ahead of a cold front
extended from the lower Mississippi Valley through the middle
Atlantic Coast region to southern New England.
   During the afternoon, a thunderstorm in northern Georgia produced
high wind which blew down at least one large tree in northern Floyd
County, the National Weather Service said.
   Numerous showers and thunderstorms also developed over the
Florida Peninsula during the afternoon.
   Thunderstorms extended from southwestern to northeastern Nebraska
during the afternoon. Morning thunderstorms in north-central
Nebraska produced one inch-diameter hail near Stuart, Amelia and
Burwell. During the afternoon, a thunderstorm produced hail 2 inches
in diameter at Comstock.
   Elsewhere, an approaching storm system brought showers to western
Oregon.
   Highs reached only the 60s and upper 50s in northeastern
Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, Upper Michigan and northern Lower
Michigan, and frost and freeze advisories were posted into Thursday
morning for Upper Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 102 at Phoenix. Wednesday's low in
the Lower 48 states was 36 at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Thursday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the eastern half of Texas through Louisiana and Arkansas to
Florida and Georgia. Showers and thunderstorms also were forecast
from eastern Montana to the western Great Lakes region. A cold front
nearing the northern Pacific Coast was expected to produce scattered
showers and thunderstorms over Oregon and Washington.
   Highs in the 60s were predicted over northern Maine and western
sections of the Great Lakes region; in the 60s and 70s from New
England to the Great Lakes region and the northern Ohio Valley; in
the 70s along the California coast and across the Pacific Northwest;
in the lower 90s across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina; in the
90s across much of the high Plains region, the Rockies and the
Southwest; and above 100 from southwestern Texas to the deserts of
southern California.

   A state judge refused to grant an injunction
Wednesday for parishioners hoping to keep open 14 Roman Catholic
churches set to be closed in an effort to consolidate waning
membership and finances.
   The request for the injunction was the latest move in a long
fight against the closings by bitter parishioners and clergy in the
1.5 million-member Archdiocese of Detroit.
   Wayne County Circuit Judge James A. Hathaway made the decision
Wednesday, saying courts shouldn't settle religious disputes and,
``It was Jesus' idea that we love one another, and with a little
effort we can do that.''
   Outside the Wayne County Courthouse, more than 150 demonstrators
marched and sang ``We Shall Overcome'' to protest the closings.
   ``This idea of walking around with posters and haranguing each
other _ I don't want to see that. We need to approach the matter
from the point of trying to heal differences rather than exacerbate
them,'' the judge said.
   Hathaway agreed to consider issuing a temporary stay of Cardinal
Edmund Szoka's order to close the churches to give opponents a
chance to go to the Michigan Court of Appeals. A hearing was
scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday.
   Since January, 16 of 30 parishes targeted to be closed have been
shut down by the Archdiocese of Detroit, including five last
weekend. The closings come under a plan Cardinal Edmund Szoka said
will strengthen the church by creating fewer parishes.
   Szoka said the closings became necessary as hundreds of thousands
of Catholics joined the migration to the suburbs of Detroit in
recent decades. It left fewer than 50,000 Catholics in the nation's
sixth-largest city.
   Detroit's population is approximately 1.1 million; about 4
million people live in the metropolitan area.
   Five parishes have permission to remain open until July 16, four
others have longer extensions tied to priests' retirements or church
anniversaries and the rest are to close by Friday, archdiocese
spokesman Jay Berman said Tuesday.
   Robert Van Cleef, an attorney for the 18 churches that are suing
to stay open, argued Wednesday that Szoka reneged on a promise to
conduct open grievance hearings before closing parishes.
   Szoka's attorney, Joseph Sullivan, said church members wouldn't
suffer by having their parishes closed until all appeals to the
Vatican are exhausted.
   ``It's a little bit difficult for me to understand that
worshiping at a church a few blocks away or a half-mile or a mile
from where one used to worship is a serious problem,'' he said.
   Church members said Wednesday they haven't lost all hopes of
saving their parishes.
   ``All I can say is we're in good company,'' said Leonard Gross, a
member of Our Lady of the Rosary. ``David had a lot of opposition
when he went up against Goliath.''
   Berman said the often-emotional struggle over the closings was a
painful period that is about to end. He expressed hope that Detroit
Catholics would begin working to strengthen the church.
   ``It's fortunate that this is now being brought to a close
because we can now focus on the mission, which is to revitalize and
re-energize the church in the city,'' Berman said.
   Last September, Szoka unveiled a proposal to close or merge 48 of
112 parishes within the city. Initially, members of most targeted
parishes opposed the move, filing internal appeals with the
archbishop.
   On Jan. 8, Szoka said 30 churches would close this year and 25
more would have until 1990 to increase membership and improve their
finances.
   Last week, priests, nuns and parishioners from nine parishes said
they would defy the closing order. In several cases, they have held
services outside locked buildings.
   But determination to resist the closings began to crumble when
Szoka announced last week that the Vatican had rejected appeals
filed in March by 14 parishes.
   Opponents of the closings said they may consider filing an appeal
with the Vatican supreme court, a move Berman said the cardinal
believes would be a waste of time.
   ``This week is pivotal, and the people here will hold a town hall
meeting next Sunday to decide what we will do,'' said the Rev. A.J.
Conti of St. Ignatius of Antioch parish.

<HEAD>Abortion Ruling May Be Announced Thursday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest word on abortion law, expected in a
Missouri case that has become the most closely watched Supreme Court
controversy of the decade, may be announced Thursday.
   And maybe not.
   The case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, has captured
enormous attention because the justices are being asked to use it to
overturn the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   It is one of five cases in which decisions are pending, and some
word must come in each before the 1988-89 term concludes.
   The court last week announced it would release decisions Monday
and Thursday this week. The assumption, and probably still the best
bet, was that Thursday would be the court's last day on the bench.
   But there is no guarantee. When the justices take the bench at 10
a.m. EDT Thursday, they might not have all five decisions.
   Court officials could announce that some decisions will be
released later, and the possibility remains that one or more of the
cases will be ordered held over for reargument in the next term,
which begins in October. That could delay announcement of a decision
until sometime in 1990.
   Since 1977, the court has ordered at least one case held over for
reargument each year.
   The landmark 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade said women have a
constitutional right, based on their right to privacy, to abortions.
   The decision said a woman's decision to have an abortion during
the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her
doctor. It said states may regulate abortions during the second
trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to
protect fetal life in the third trimester.
   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester
was not made absolute, however.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese manufacturer and Texas
supplier were indicted Wednesday on charges of fraud, accused of
supplying substandard nuts and bolts to the Defense Department and a
nuclear power plant.
   Officials said the fasteners were used in civilian trucks,
military vehicles and at the Comanche Peak nuclear power plant in
Glen Rose, Texas. But they said they do not know how many
substandard parts were used, where they were used or how many were
brought into the country.
   Government tests found the bolts were weaker than their labeling
indicated and could break under stress, said Charles Harrison,
assistant special agent in charge of U.S. Customs in Houston.
   ``It's like if someone orders a Cadillac and you slap a Cadillac
emblem on a Chevrolet and sell it as a Cadillac,'' said Jim Flick,
agent in charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service in the
Fort Worth branch of the Inspector General's office.
   Officials learned about the substandard fasteners 2{ years ago
after a tip.
   Harrison said there were no reports of injuries resulting from
failure of substandard nuts and bolts, although some of the parts
were shipped to a Peterbilt Motors Co. plant in Denton and caused
minor accidents after being installed in tractor-trailer rigs.
   Brooks Griffin, senior investigator with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission regional office in Arlington, said several substandard
bolts had to be replaced in the nuclear power plant's residual heat
removal system, which helps cool the reactor core.
   Griffin declined to speculate what would have happened had the
plant begun operations with the substandard parts, but he said it
would have been unsafe.
   The indictment names Yamaguchi-Seisakusha Co. Ltd. of Shizuoka,
Japan; Aircom Fasteners Inc. of Arlington, Texas; and 11 employees
of the two companies.
   Five employees of the Japanese company could each face $3 million
in fines and 78 years' imprisonment if convicted. Harrison said the
United States will seek their extradition. Six Aircom employees
could face fines ranging from $750,000 to $6.2 million and prison
sentences of 15 to 143 years.
   If convicted, Yamaguchi-Seisakusho faces fines of $3 million on
counts of fraud, mail fraud and entry into the United States of
falsely labeled goods, Collins said. Aircom faces fines of up to
$6.2 million on numerous fraud counts.
   Charles Blau, attorney for Aircom president Gerald L. Dunsmore,
said Dunsmore and the company are innocent.
   Dunsmore and four other Aircom employees made preliminary court
appearances Wednesday and were released on their personal
recognizance. They are to be arraigned July 7. The sixth person
indicted did not appear in court.
   A woman who answered the phone at Aircom said no one at the
company had any comment. She did not give her name.
   Harrison said Customs is investigating at least two other
suppliers of nuts and bolts in the Southwest, and more indictments
are expected within a few months.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Blame Environmentalists For Scuttling Ancient Forest Compromise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last-minute efforts to revive a compromise
aimed at ending the bitter owls-vs.-trees fight over the ancient
forests of the Northwest collapsed Wednesday with most lawmakers
blaming environmentalists for scuttling the proposal.
   After a 45-minute joint meeting of the Oregon and Washington
state delegations, congressmen said they would drop their effort to
attach the compromise to the House interior appropriations bill
Thursday.
   Lawmakers added, however, they would still try to negotiate a
settlement between environmentalists and the timber industry.
   Environmentalists, who on Tuesday rejected the compromise
proposed at a weekend ``timber summit,'' said they, too, were
willing to continue negotiations and thought the proposal offered
the framework for a possible solution, possibly to attach to the
bill when the counterpart Senate committee takes it up.
   Oregon Democratic Rep. Les AuCoin called the decision not to seek
a legislative solution now a ``lost opportunity'' to ensure a
short-term supply of logs for Northwest mills while protecting the
old-growth forests where the rare northern spotted owl lives.
   ``Environmentalists have decided to pursue a strategy that is
shortsighted, politically risky, if not plain dumb,'' said AuCoin.
``I don't think they understand how damned mad the people of the
Northwest will be over the torpedoing of what was a fair, equitable
and balanced proposal.''
   Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., said that environmentalists have been
able to put a virtual ``stranglehold'' on the supply of timber for
Northwest mills by securing court injunctions barring timber sales
in spotted owl habitat.
   The compromise called for harvesting of 8 billion board feet of
timber from the national forests of the Northwest and 1 billion
board feet from Bureau of Land Management forests in Oregon over the
next 15 months _ roughly the quantity loggers said they needed to
keep area mills running, though not necessarily in the same places.
   The deal also would have ended all court appeals of timber sales
during the period and would have protected large blocks of old
growth from fragmentation by logging roads and scattered clearcuts.
   Environmentalists said they thought the plan was vague and they
did not have adequate time to consider it. They, too, said they were
optimistic about an eventual agreement, despite the criticism from
lawmakers.
   ``There is not a level playing field here,'' said Swift. ``We
must appeal to them (environmentalists) for more flexibility.''
   ``Fingerpointing isn't going to get anything done,'' said Lee
Keller Reis, a spokeswoman for the National Wildlife Federation.
``We have been willing to talk all along and we are still willing to
talk.''
   George Frampton Jr., president of The Wilderness Society, said
negotiations were ``far from over'' and it was just ``unrealistic''
to expect that a compromise proposed on Saturday could be nailed
down so quickly.
   Environmentalists have sought to have the spotted owl, which
nests only in the old-growth forest of Oregon, Washington and
northern California, protected as a threatened or endangered species
as part of their campaign to halt logging in the ancient forests.
Such a designation for any species requires that its habitat be
preserved.
   The industry has claimed such protection would lock up vast
sections of the federal forests to logging, creating economic
catastrophe in dozens of one-mill towns.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed the owl for
listing as a threatened species, but a decision might still be two
years away.
   Timber industry representatives, who had reluctantly accepted the
compromise, said they were not surprised the lawmakers had decided
not to pursue legislation.

   A Soviet team will visit an East Texas

Pershing IA ballistic missiles under a treaty between the
superpowers, officials said Wednesday.
   The procedure at Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant will finish the
destruction of an entire class of nuclear weapons, military
officials said.
   A Pershing IA first-stage rocket motor and a second-stage rocket
engine will be destroyed at 11 a.m. by static firing, weather
permitting.
   Army officials said eliminations of the Pershing II missile
system will continue at Longhorn and at the Army Pueblo Depot
Activity near Pueblo, Colo.
   Earlier, U.S. officials notified the Soviet Union in accordance
with the Treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces.
   Russian teams made several visits to East Texas last year to
witness the start of the missile burnings at the vast 8,493-acre
plant about 150 miles east of Dallas near the Texas-Louisiana border.

<TEXT>
   A delegate to a convention of a
dissident Chinese group declared himself a spy sent to infiltrate
the group and said he wanted to sever his ties with China, a group
spokesman said.
   Shou Huaqing told members of the Chinese Alliance for Democracy
he wanted to come forward because he was shaken by the bloody
crackdown of pro-democracy activists in China, alliance chairman Hu
Ping said Tuesday.
   Shou was taken to the FBI's West Covina office after his
surprising declaration Friday and his whereabouts were unknown, said
Hu.
   FBI officials declined to comment. ``We just don't address that
sort of question for the media,'' said FBI spokesman Fred Reagan in
Los Angeles.
   Shou's remarks created a stir at the fourth worldwide convention
of the alliance, formed seven years ago by overseas Chinese scholars
who favor democratic reforms in China, said Hu.
   The group, which lists 3,000 members worldwide, publishes China
Spring, a Chinese-language magazine critical of the Communist
government.
   Shou told the delegates that the Chinese government assigned him
to infiltrate the alliance, disrupt the group's work and find
evidence of a financial link between it and the Taiwan government,
Hu said.
   Shou, believed to be in his 30s, moved from Shanghai to Missouri
about two years ago to attend Washington University in St. Louis. He
wrote for China Spring under various pen names, said Hu.
   Last October, Hu sponsored Shou to become an alliance member.
   Chris Wu, a Monterey Park engineer, said Shou told him he decided
to reveal his activities because of the June 4 massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators by government troops in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square.
   ``He said he cried for several days. He was determined to change
his life,'' Wu said.

<TEXT>
   A heavy load, wind gusts and engine
problems caused an Air Force jet to crash and burn on takeoff from a
Texas base, killing 19 people, said a military report released
Wednesday.
   The KC-135A tanker crashed Jan. 31 at Dyess Air Force Base near
Abilene, Texas. The refueling plane was carrying a crew from
Michigan's Sawyer Air Force Base to participate in exercises over
Guam.
   The death toll included eight military retirees and family
members taking advantage of a policy that lets them hop overseas
flights as space permits. Two of those killed had just boarded at
Dyess.
   The Air Force isn't limiting the numbers of civilians catching
such flights because of the crash, said Maj. Ken St. John, a
spokesman for the 8th Air Force in Barksdale, La.
   The Air Force report released Wednesday fails to say outright why
the 26-year-old tanker swerved suddenly into the ground as it took
off from Dyess.
   The report notes the possible failure of a water-injection system
designed to give the jet extra liftoff power, and mentions that the
heavily loaded plane was struggling to take off under gusting winds.
   ``There wasn't anything black and white,'' St. John said. ``The
team believes a combination of factors was involved.''
   St. John said the investigating team blamed the crash on the
combined effect of the gusting wind, the plane's full weight and its
failing water-injection system. He said witnesses also told
investigators the craft took off at too steep an angle, which also
would have cut its liftoff power.
   Repair records showed the craft's water-injection system had
failed eight times from October to December. Maintenance crews
replaced one engine and believed they had the problem fixed, St.
John said.
   ``Those kinds of malfunctions are not unusual,'' he said. ``It is
a recurrent problem with the KC-135A.''
   The crash was the second at Dyess in less than three months, and
third in three months involving a plane from Sawyer, a nuclear base
by Lake Superior.
   Six people died Oct. 11 when another plane from Sawyer crashed
during landing at Wurtsmith Air Force Base in eastern Lower
Michigan. Pilot inexperience was cited as a factor.
   A broken fuel pump overheated and sparked the Dec. 6 explosion of
a B-52 bomber during touc-and-go landings at Sawyer. All eight crew
members survived in what base personnel called a miracle.
   Sawyer, part of the nation's Strategic Air Command, maintains
nuclear bombers on 24-hour alert.

   Against the advice of its chairman, the House
Armed Services Committee voted Wednesday to restore funds to the
$295 billion defense budget to save a Marine aircraft and F-14D
fighter jet the Bush administration wants to cancel.
   In a vote marked by high drama, the Democratic-controlled panel
tied 26-all on an amendment to accept the $64 billion procurement
budget without any add-ons or deletion.
   Reps. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., and Ron Dellums, D-Calif.,
initially passed during the roll call but then cast ``no'' votes
that resulted in a tie and the amendment's failure.
   By virtue of the measure's defeat, two other amendments saving
the Marine Corps V-22 Osprey and the Navy's F-14D Tomcat fighter,
and providing about $1 billion for the National Guard and reserves
by reducing funds for the B-2 stealth bomber, were adopted as part
of the procurement budget.
   In a final vote, the committee sent the bill to the full House,
44-5.
   Individual amendments to cancel the B-2 program outright, cut all
funds to move 50 MX missiles from silos to railroad cars and reduce
B-2 spending by $379 million to buy Army ammunition were defeated.
   Approved and made part of the procurement budget was an amendment
introduced by Reps. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa.,
that would provide $157 million in the 1990 fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 for the Bell-Boeing V-22, to be built in Fort Worth, Texas,
and which Defense Secretary Dick Cheney wants to cancel.
   The F-14D fighter, which is manufactured by Grumman Corp., on
Long Island, would receive $230 million.
   The amendment backed by Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., would
take $500 million from the B-2 bomber and about $520 million from
spare parts for the National Guard and reserves.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., had urged his
colleagues to accept the procurement budget as presented. Last week,
in a 10-9 vote, the procurement subcommittee had responded
positively to Aspin's call.
   But members expressed dismay with Aspin's schedule for voting on
the amendments which even if approved would be negated if the panel,
in its last decision, accepted Cheney's $64 billion procurement
budget.
   ``It's like going to a dance by yourself. You get to dance with
all the girls but at the end you get to pick only one to take
home,'' said Rep. Arthur Ravenel Jr., R-S.C.
   Nevertheless, the panel voted on five individual amendments
before deciding against Cheney's budget.
   By a vote of 36-16, the panel rejected an amendment introduced by
Dellums to cancel the B-2 bomber, which at between $500 million and
$650 million a copy is considered the most expensive plane in
history.
   ``It's time to cut ... loose from the monument to misallocated
money,'' Dellums argued. ``We've obligated ourselves to $22 billion
without knowing whether this plane can fly.''
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who backed the amendment, noted that
every week the Air Force changes the mission for the radar-evading
plane.
   Another B-2 opponent, Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., reminded his
colleagues that based on the newly declassified cost figures
released by the Pentagon, it was likely that Congress would use the
proposed $5 billion in fiscal 1991 for the B-2 as a ``cash cow.''
   But Aspin argued that a vote on the B-2 will take place on the
House floor and ``total termination at this point is wrong.''
   The panel also rejected Dellums' amendment to stop $164 million
requested by the Pentagon to move 50 MX missiles from silos to
railroad cars. The vote was 42-10.
   The panel did approve a report's language that transferred money
from B-2 procurement to research and development on the stealth
bomber. A day earlier, the panel rejected an amendment to restore
$351 million for the bomber that the research and development
subcommittee voted to spend on the Osprey.
   That vote left $2.7 billion in procurement funds for the B-2 and
cut the proposed $1.8 billion for research and development to about
$1.5 billion.
   In its first work of the day, the committee beat back efforts to
provide money, at the expense of the stealth bomber, for buying the
V-22, a revolutionary aircraft that would take off like a helicopter
but fly like an airplane.
   In the two votes, the committee:
   _Rejected by voice vote an amendment by Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.,
that would have cut funds for the B-2 by $850 million and allocated
$157 million for the Osprey, contingent on Cheney's reevaluation of
the aircraft.
   _Rejected 31-21 an amendment by Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, to
reduce B-2 money by $900 million and restore $157 million for the
Osprey without any restrictions.
   Aspin said Wednesday of the procurement budget, ``I support Dick
Cheney's budget not because it's Dick Cheney's. ... I played with
the amendments and I didn't come up with anything better than what
Cheney had.''
   The committee also approved an additional $300 million for the
Department of Energy to clean up toxic and radioactive wastes at
nuclear weapons sites.
   And the panel accepted an amendment requiring the Bush
administration to certify that safety standards for the withdrawal
of chemical stockpiles in Europe be met before certain money could
be spent.
   Both measures were approved by voice vote.
   Late Tuesday, the panel agreed to reduce the number of troops
stationed in Europe in connection with the U.S.-Soviet
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty by 15,000.
   Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative,
took a $1.1 billion cut as the committee, by voice vote, approved a
$3.5 billion budget, considerably less than the $4.6 billion Bush
proposed for the program to develop lasers and other weapons to stop
enemy nuclear missiles.
   That reduction came on top of a $1 billion cut in proposed Star
Wars spending made by Cheney two months ago as he slashed $10
billion from the budget.

<HEAD>El Salvador Aid Restrictions Rejected</HEAD>

   The House Wednesday rejected an effort to
attach strings to U.S. aid to El Salvador as it worked toward
completion of a $23 billion two-year foreign aid bill.
   Lawmakers voted 233-185 to kill an amendment by Rep. Matthew
McHugh, D-N.Y., that would have held back $34 million in military
aid to El Salvador next year until Congress had a chance to review
how the right-wing ruling ARENA party is handling human rights.
   McHugh argued that the amendment, backed primarily by Democrats,
would keep pressure on newly elected ARENA president Alfredo
Cristiani to curb right-wing death squads and work toward a peaceful
settlement of a civil war with leftist rebels.
   Without some chance to review the aid _ totaling $170 million
over the life of the bill _ Congress would be giving Cristiani ``a
blank check for two years,'' he said.
   But opponents noted that the bill already gives Congress a chance
to vote down further aid next April if it finds serious human rights
abuses and accused Democrats of harboring grudges left over from
tensions over Central America with the Reagan administration.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, arguing against the proposal, noted that the
FMLN guerillas have been accused of numerous recent murders of
civilians, including Cristiani's chief of staff. ``The FMLN has
never been more brutal in its tactics,'' Hyde said. ``Why in the
world would you want to coddle these people?''
   Consideration of the measure was expected to extend into
Thursday, when the House was to take up an amendment imposing a
series of new sanctions against China for its deadly crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., said the list would include
suspending trade and development programs, banning the sale of
police-related weapons and limiting transfer of high-technology
items.
   ``I think it sends a very strong signal to the leaders and people
of China that the United States will not continue business as usual
in the absence of fundamental human rights improvement,'' Solarz
said.
   The bill authorizes the spending of up to $11.5 billion each in
fiscal 1990 and 1991 for the entire range of U.S. foreign aid
programs, including military support, economic subsidies and
development aid for friendly countries around the world.
   The measure, perenially one of the most politically unpopular to
come before Congress, still faces an uphill fight. No separate
foreign aid bill has been enacted since 1985; each year's aid since
then has been taken care of in annual spending bills.
   This year, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has had a
particularly hard time grappling with its version, prompting
chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., to observe that there is ``a
profound lack of interest'' in the measure. In addition, the Bush
administration has threatened a veto over provisions it says
unfairly limit the president's foreign policy latitude.
   As they worked through a deep pile of amendments to the bill, the
lawmakers also:
   _Rejected, 212-204, a proposal to force random drug testing for
State Department employees and others involved in administering
foreign aid programs.
   _Earmarked $7.5 million in each of the two years of the bill for
``humanitarian aid'' for the people of Lebanon, to be administered
through international aid agencies.
   _Approved a non-binding amendment stating that election law
reforms undertaken by the left-wing Sandinista government in
Nicaragua do not meet the requirement of a regional peace accord.

   Leona Helmsley cried in court Wednesday when her
lawyer argued she could not get a fair trial unless he was allowed
to show that one of her co-defendants had stolen money from Helmsley
businesses.
   ``This isn't going to be a trial, it's going to be a farce,''
said her lawyer, Gerald Feffer.
   Mrs. Helmsley, who sat facing U.S. District Judge John Walker
Jr., used her hands to wipe away tears that fell down her face. A
judge's clerk later brought her a handful of tissues.
   The arguments came late in the afternoon after Walker completed
three days of screening potential jurors for the tax evasion trial
of Mrs. Helmsley and two former aides.
   Feffer asked the judge for broad latitude in presenting evidence,
cross-examining witnesses and arguing in his opening and closing
statements that co-defendant Frank J. Turco, an ex-senior officer
with Helmsley Hotels, had engaged in ``wholesale theft'' from the
Helmsleys.
   ``It's an essential part of our defense,'' he said.
   Turco's attorney, William Brodsky, argued a separate motion
asking that his client be severed from the trial because Mrs.
Helmsley's defense would be prejudicial and deny him a fair trial.
   ``I think it would be devastating for Mr. Turco to have two sides
attacking him with artillery,'' Brodsky said, referring to Assistant
U.S. Attorney James DaVita and Feffer.
   Walker reserved decision on both motions.
   Feffer claimed he had evidence that showed Turco had siphoned
large amounts of money and deposited it into his personal bank
accounts.
   One charge in the indictment alleged that Mrs. Helmsley had
instructed employees, through Turco, to submit phony travel vouchers
and then give her the cash, Feffer said. He alleged that Turco had
kept the money and that it was not passed on to Mrs. Helmsley.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 68, who with her husband heads a $5 billion real
estate and hotel empire, is charged with conspiracy, tax and fraud
charges in connection with the billing of more than $4 million in
personal expenses to Helmsley-controlled companies.
   Among the expenses prosecutors allege were wrongfully reported
were renovations, including the installation of a marble dance
floor, at the couple's mansion in Greenwich, Conn.
   Two former aides, Turco and Joseph Licari, are charged with
assisting in the scheme. Mrs. Helmsley's 80-year-old husband, Harry,
was indicted but removed from the trial for health reasons.
   Mrs. Helmsley and Turco also are charged with extortion for
allegedly shaking down employees and contractors doing business with
the Helmsley companies.
   Walker completed choosing a pool of 60 potential jurors. On
Wednesday, before opening arguments, lawyers and prosecutors will
select the 12 jurors and six alternates who will serve.

   A fraud case against Northrop Corp. now
includes allegations the defense contractor sold the government
about 200 improperly tested guidance systems for missiles and
planes, rather than 17.
   The amended indictment, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court by
the U.S. Attorney's Office, adds 22 counts to a 167-count indictment
filed April 11.
   The company was charged with conspiracy and lying to the
government in the testing and sale of stabilization devices used in
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and the Marines' AV-8B Harrier jets.
   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio repeated the company's position
that there had been no wrongdoing.
   The government alleges the company sold devices, called flight
data transmitters and costing $4,000 to $6,000 apiece, that had
failed tests to show they would work at temperatures as low as 65
degrees below zero.
   Contracts required that test because the gyroscopic devices must
work in the cold encountered at high altitudes.
   The original indictment alleged 17 of more than 1,000 of the
units sold from 1984 through 1989 had been improperly tested. The
amended indictment says 200 weren't properly tested.
   Northrop, which makes the flight data transmitters at its Pomona
plant, could be fined up to $30 million if convicted.

<TEXT>
   The governing National Party will
campaign in parliamentary elections this year on a platform
envisioning a direct vote for blacks in national affairs within five
years, according to party leaders.
   The platform, to be adopted Thursday at a party congress in
Pretoria, includes removal of criminal penalties for residential
apartheid violations, more government subsidies for multiracial
schools, removal of race as the major criterion for identifying
political groups, a bill of rights, and negotiating a new
constitution with black leaders.
   Much of the platform represents a softening of Nationalist
policies aimed at maintaining white control.
   In London, a leader of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla group called it an advance, but from a wrong position.
   ``It's a step forward to the extent that the National Party
recognizes that South Africa cannot be ruled on the basis of
exclusive power for the white minority,'' said Thabo Mbeki,
secretary for international affairs, en route to the ANC's base in
Lusaka, Zambia.
   ``But the position is wrong because it continues to define people
as black and white and not as the people of South Africa. The period
of transition must emerge from negotiations.''
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe outlined the platform
at a news briefing.
   The five-year plan does not specifically say blacks could vote
directly for national representatives within five years, but van der
Merwe and Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said that was what it
foresees.
   The platform appears consistent with the Nationalists' declared
goal of providing blacks with a national political voice in a way
that would preserve rights for the whites and other minorities.
Black activists seek a one-man, one-vote system that would
effectively transfer power to the black majority.
   The platform is believed to reflect the thinking of National
Party leader F.W. de Klerk, designated successor to President P.W.
Botha, who says he will retire after elections Sept. 6.
   The plan begins with the statement: ``South Africa is one
undivided state with one citizenship for all. Every South African
has the right to participate in political decision-making on all
levels of government which affect his interests, subject to the
principle of no domination.''
   Van der Merwe said that to keep the 5 million whites from being
dominated by the 28 million blacks, government officials
contemplated forming something like the U.N. Security Council, in
which major powers have a veto on some issues, but not all.
   Specifics are to be negotiated with ``recognized leaders of all
groups committed to the pursuit of peaceful solutions,'' the plan
says.
   Botha's government has been accused of jailing and silencing
legitimate black leaders, while seeking to negotiate with those who
have no constituency.
   Van der Merwe said the Nationalists would modify their demand
that black negotiators renounce violence and require only that they
be committed to peaceful solutions.
   The demand for renunciation of violence has been seen as an
obstacle to talks with the ANC, which conducts guerrilla attacks in
South Africa but says it also seeks peaceful solutions.
   Groups, their identities and their rights still are a major part
of the Nationalist manifesto, but van der Merwe said the plan calls
for ``a shift from the present race-defined groups to culturally
defined groups'' for political purposes, and for people in groups,
not the government, to decide who can join.
   He said this means that eventually, the Population Registration
Act, a cornerstone law of apartheid, would ``cease to be required.''
The act classifies South Africans racially, for purposes of housing,
education, medical treatment, military service, political rights,
and access to public amenities.
   The Nationalists remain committed to racially segregated schools
for those who prefer them, but the platform commits the party to
providing ``a system of subsidized private schools for those who
prefer to live outside a specific group context.''
   The government already subsidizes some private, multiracial
schools. Van der Merwe and du Plessis said the plan envisages
expanding the subsidies. Eventually, there would be a dual
educational system, racially segregated ``public schools'' and
multiracial ``private schools,'' both funded by the government.
   The Group Areas Act, another pillar of apartheid, will remain on
the books, meaning it will still be a crime to live in a
neighborhood designated for another race. But the party plan calls
for a system of ``assistance and negotiation'' to ``solve the
problem without legal intervention.''

   A federal judge Wednesday ordered a special federal
grand jury impaneled to investigate alleged criminal activity at
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant.
   There are two regular grand juries in Colorado, but U.S. District
Judge Sherman Finesilver said a special one should be called Aug. 1
because ``there is a possibility of a lengthy investigation.''
   FBI and Environmental Protection Agency investigators raided
Rocky Flats, 16 miles northwest of Denver, on June 6 looking for
evidence of criminal environmental violations, including illegal
disposal of hazardous wastes.
   The Department of Energy plant is operated by Rockwell
International, and uses plutonium to fashion triggers for nuclear
bombs.
   Finesilver issued the order at the request of the U.S. Attorney
General's office, but U.S. Attorney Mike Norton in Denver declined
to comment.
   Gov. Roy Romer, who on Wednesday signed an agreement with Energy
Secretary James Watkins allowing Colorado to more closely monitor
Rocky Flats, hailed the decision to call a special grand jury.
   ``I welcome anything that helps get the complete facts on the
table. We need to remove the mystery about Rocky Flats and I think a
grand jury will help accomplish that. I want all of the truth to
come out,'' he said.
   Three days after federal investigators raided Rocky Flats, a
federal judge unsealed the FBI affidavit that led to the search
warrant at the plant.
   The affidavit alleged that plant workers burned hazardous wastes
illegally in a plutonium reprocessing building that had been closed
for safety violations.
   It also says the plant illegally discharged pollutants into two
creeks that flow into water supplies serving four Denver suburbs,
and illegally dumped hazardous wastes. Documents allegedly were
falsified to cover up the acts, the affidavit said.

   Grenada's former police commissioner
went on a shooting rampage at police headquarters Wednesday, killing
the commissioner and a U.S. diplomat and wounding two high-ranking
officers, an official said.
   In Washington, the State Department said the American died trying
to subdue the gunman, who was later killed by other law officers.
   The shooting occurred at 11:30 a.m. at Fort George, the police
headquarters, which overlooks St. George's Harbor.
   The State Department and officials in Grenada said the slain
diplomat, John Angelo Butler, 33, of Twentynine Palms, Calif., the
political officer at the U.S. Embassy, was not the original target.
Police Commissioner Cosmus Raymond also was killed, officials said.
   Daniel Searles, the acting police superintendent, and Collis
Barrow, deputy police commissioner, were wounded and taken to St.
George's General Hospital, Deputy Prime Minister Ben Jones said.
Both were listed in stable condition.
   Officials identified the attacker as Grafton Bascombe. His motive
was not known.
   State Department press officer Dennis Harter said in Washington
his department understood Bascombe was on loan to the neighboring
Caribbean island of St. Vincent and had been about to return there.
   Albert Xavier, an adviser to Prime Minister Herbert Blaize, said
Bascombe's return was delayed because he was in charge of funds made
available for joint military exercises with the United States and
was to have given an accounting to Raymond on Wednesday.
   Xavier said Bascombe entered Raymond's office and fired two shots
from a .45-caliber revolver, hitting the commissioner in the head
and stomach and killing him instantly.
   Bascombe next walked into Barrow's office next door, where U.S.
Embassy and police officials were meeting. Butler and administrative
officer Roy Sullivan were representing the embassy.
   Harter reported: ``They were discussing administrative details
connected with the recently concluded Operation Trade Winds joint
military exercises held in Grenada last week.
   ``They were also discussing security plans for the Fourth of July
reception scheduled to be held at the American Embassy. According to
eyewitness accounts, ... Bascombe ... burst into the room, fired
several shots, critically wounding ... Barrow and ... Searles.
   ``John Butler made a move to subdue the assailant, who then shot
Mr. Butler point-blank before fleeing the room.
   `` Mr. Butler apparently was killed instantly.
   ``We ... can't speculate on ... (Bascombe's) motives but we have
no indication that Mr. Butler was a deliberate target of the killer.
This does not appear to have been an act of political terrorism.''
   According to Xavier, Bascombe fired first at Barrow, hitting him
in the thigh, and then at Searles, hitting him in both legs.
   Xavier said Butler was shot fatally in the stomach. He said
Sullivan was not hurt.
   Harter said the California-born Butler had been assigned in
Grenada as political officer since the summer of 1988.
   Butler joined the foreign service in 1980 and served in the
Dominican Republic and Costa Rica, Harter said. Butler was a
graduate of the University of San Diego and had a graduate degree
from San Diego State. He leaves his wife and a stepchild, both of
whom were in Grenada.
   After the attack, Bascombe reportedly walked onto the veranda of
the police station, threw his revolver and police cap into the yard
below, then put his hands above his head and ran down the hill,
Xavier said.
   One witness said, however, that Bascombe was apprehended by
police in the station yard and dragged to a police building. A
doctor who examined Bascombe said he found him handcuffed, lying on
the floor and bleeding from a facial wound, Xavier said.
   Harter said the department had no details of how Bascombe was
killed.
   Grenada is an island of about 100,000 people in the Caribbean.
   In October 1983, U.S. Marines and paratroopers, along with a
small Caribbean force, invaded the island and toppled a Marxist
junta that had seized power.

<HEAD>Panel: Gold Mining, Settlements Killing Indians and Rain Forest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of gold prospectors in the
Amazon are devastating rain forests and killing off the world's
largest primitive Indian tribe, a panel of officials, scientists and
clerics said Wednesday.
   Indian reservations are being ``physically, morally and
culturally destroyed'' by uncontrolled gold mining and settlement in
the region, said ``Action for the Citizens.''
   It is the first time government officials have spoken against
destruction of the Yanomami Indian tribe and the rain forest by gold
miners. In this nation where the frontier spirit is strong and
rugged prospectors are widely seen as folk heroes, the government
has rarely intervened.
   The commission of Justice Ministry officials, lawmakers, lawyers,
scientists, Roman Catholic Church members and missionaries said
whites disrupted Indian hunting, contaminated rivers with mercury
used to join gold dust particles and spread fatal diseases among the
Indian population.
   The Yanomamis are a tribe of about 9,000 in the far northern
states of Amazonas and Roraima, near the Venezuelan border. The area
is rich in timber, gold, diamonds and other minerals and has been
invaded by an estimated 100,000 prospectors, despite a government
ban prohibiting whites from entering Indian reservations.
   ``Owing to the tolerance of the authorities before an invasion of
thousands of gold miners into the reserves, we are seeing the
genocide of the Yanomani Indians, devastation of nature,
contamination of rivers and a gigantic ecological disaster,'' Sen.
Severo Gomes of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party
said in an interview.
   Gomes had joined House member Plinio Arruda Sampaio of the
leftist Workers' Party, Archbishop Aldo Mongiano and 15 other
members in a recent three-day trip to several Yanomami reservations
in the far-off jungle state of Roraima, some 3,720 miles northwest
of Rio de Janeiro.
   The delegation also visited territories of the Macuxi, Wapixana,
Ingarico, and Taurepang tribes, which have been invaded by ranchers
that burned off and cleared indigenous farmland.
   The 26-page report denounced a ``complete disregard for the law''
by the miners and the lack of government enforcement in the region,
which it said even led to contrabanding of gold.
   All gold is required by law to be sold to the government.
   ``The miners themselves, with their guns, resolve all legal
problems,'' said Senator Gomes.
   Prospectors illegally used jungle airstrips cut by the Brazilian
Air Force ``every five minutes'' to transport cargo and manpower by
helicopter and planes, said Sampaio.
   ``The whole thing looks like Vietnam during the war,'' he said.
``The hellish noise of planes and helicopters sends the Indians
scattering.''
   Last year, the powerful Bishops Council of the Roman Catholic
Church warned that the Yanomamis faced extinction if their lands
were taken away. The council said the government reduced by 70
percent the tribe's 17.3 million acres of land, divided into 19
separate tracts.
   About 220,000 Indians are left in Brazil, down from an estimated
5 million when the country was discovered by the Portuguese in 1500.

<TEXT>
   More than 500 animation cells from the 1988
box-office hit ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' were sold at auction
Wednesday, with the top-selling frame bringing more than $50,000.
   The standing-room-only sale at Sotheby's auction house, called
``The Art of Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' brought $1.66 million, or
about twice the $600,000 to $900,000 pre-sale estimate, said Matthew
Weigman, a Sotheby's spokesman.
   Four cells of the so-called Toons _ cartoon characters _
assembled at the end of the movie brought the highest prices.
   A cell featuring about two dozen cartoon characters, from Roger
Rabbit and Jessica to Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Betty Boop and Bugs
Bunny, sold for $50,600 to the Philip Samuels Fine Art Gallery in
St. Louis, Mo..
   Private collectors bought the other three, which went for
$33,000, $31,900 and $27,500.
   The cells are painted on acetate and mounted against the color
photograph background used in the movie. They ranged in size from 10
inches by 39 inches to 7 inches by 13 inches.
   David Redden, Sotheby's senior vice president and auctioneer at
the six-hour sale, said prices were much higher than expected
primarily because ``it's hard for us to put values on these since
it's the first time Roger Rabbit cells have ever been offered at
auction.''
   Bidders included first-time buyers who loved the movie as well as
collectors who have a tradition of buying animation cells, he said.
   ``I think there a lot of collectors out there who really view
this sort of Disney animation art as real American art,'' he added.
``It's not just fun stuff, it's taken seriously.''
   Redden said an auction of animation cells is unusual, especially
so soon after the movie was released. And he acknowledged that
Sotheby's, better known for its multimillion dollar auctions of
famous paintings, was an atypical setting for a sale like this.
   ``I said to the audience after I finished that it was time to go
home and eat carrot cake,'' he said.
   The cells were sold by Walt Disney Studio and Amblin
Entertainment.
   ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' won four Academy Awards for its
technical feats in which cartoon characters interacted with live
actors.

<HEAD>R. Foster Winans Sues to Keep Royalties from Crime Victim's Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R. Foster Winans, the former Wall Street Journal
reporter convicted in an insider trading scandal, has gone to court
to keep the state Crime Victims Board from confiscating his book
royalties.
   The board is using the state's ``Son of Sam'' law to try to get
$17,000 in royalties that Winans' publisher owes him on his book,
``Trading Secrets: Seduction and Scandal at the Wall Street
Journal.''
   The law, named for so-called ``Son of Sam'' killer David
Berkowitz, was passed to keep convicted criminals from profiting
from their crimes.
   Winans, 40, seeking a hearing Wednesday, argued in papers filed
in trial-level state Supreme Court that he was convicted of federal
crimes and therefore state laws do not apply and state agencies have
no jurisdiction in his case.
   He also raised a First Amendment free speech issue, saying, ``The
law cannot possibly be applied to a professional writer since the
law would then prevent me from pursuing my only occupation.''
   Winans' 1985 conviction on 49 counts of conspiracy and fraud
stemmed from a scheme in which he passed information from the Wall
Street Journal column, ``Heard on the Street,'' which he co-wrote,
to stock brokers before it was published. The brokers used the
information to profit in stock trading.
   Winans' 18-month sentence was reduced on appeal to one year and
he was ordered to pay $5,000 to a federal crime victims' fund.
   In August 1986, St. Martin's Press published Winans' book about
his experience. His contracts called for advances of $35,000 for
hardcover rights and $30,000 for the paperback rights.
   On Jan. 14, 1987, the state Crime Victims Board moved to get the
$17,065.54 St. Martin's had not yet paid Winans. Meanwhile, federal
authorities claimed their $5,000 and Winans paid them with money he
already had.
   In his suit to collect the money his book has earned, Winans also
argued:
   _The Son of Sam law is unconstitutional because it calls for
seizure of property without due process.
   _The federal crime victims' law requires there be physical harm
to a victim, and federal authorities have a victims' reimbursement
fund which he paid into.
   _That while state law was amended in 1985 to cover federal
crimes, his crimes occurred in 1983-84 before the law was passed and
the law may not be applied retroactively.
   _That he was convicted of stealing information from his
employers, Dow Jones &amp; Co., owners of the Wall Street Journal, and
that a probation report says his former employers not asking for any
monetary recovery.

   An agreement to abandon the beleaguered
Shoreham nuclear power plant cleared its final hurdle Wednesday when
Long Island Lighting Co. shareholders overwhelmingly approved the
deal.
   ``We must now come together and end the controversy,'' Chairman
William Catacosinos told about 600 shareholders at the utility's
annual meeting. ``It's hurt all of us too much.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, who helped negotiate the deal, said the
shareholders' approval ``allows LILCO to devote itself exclusively
in the future to providing safe and reliable energy for Long Island
at the lowest possible cost.''
   The shareholders also approved the terms of a settlement of a
class-action lawsuit filed against the utility under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. It calls for Long Island
Lighting to refund $390 million to ratepayers as adjustments in
monthly bills over a 10-year period.
   The shareholders' approval was the final step necessary before
the settlement between the company and the state to close the $5.5
billion Shoreham plant can take effect.
   The utility is expected to seek permission from the federal
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to sell Shoreham for $1 to the Long
Island Power Authority, a state agency. The agency will then seek
approval from the NRC to dismantle the plant.
   The company was not guaranteed any rate increases in exchange for
agreeing to sell the plant. Cuomo predicted when the deal was
announced that any hikes would be probably less than 4.5 percent a
year. The utility's customers already pay among the highest electric
rates in the nation.
   State and local officials contend the area around the plant,
about 50 miles east of New York City, could not be safely evacuated
in the event of an accident.
   It would be the first time a completed nuclear power plant will
be closed without ever going on line.
   A preliminary tally of about 85 percent of shareholders indicated
that shareholders voted approximately 82 million to 3 million to
accept the deal, company spokesman James Lois said.
   Still, the deal could lead to a new round of battles since
federal Energy Department officials have stated they intend to block
the sale and transfer of Shoreham for dismantling.
   They contend the reactor should be mothballed so that it could be
activated if necessary to meet energy needs in the future.

   Two fast-moving blazes in drought-parched Southern California
charred several thousand acres of brush and forced evacuation of
hundreds of families Wednesday, and two blazes in New Mexico
scorched some 37,000 acres.
   About 2,500 residents of three Antelope Valley communities north
of Los Angeles were ordered evacuated when a fire that quickly
burned out of control destroyed two houses and damaged a third. The
fire had blackened 1,000 acres since it was spotted shortly before 2
p.m. Wednesday.
   Another blaze just east of Lake Elsinore charred 4,000 acres of
thick mountain brush and jumped containment lines in two areas,
forcing authorities to order evacuation of an estimated 200 families.
   Shifting afternoon winds complicated firefighting efforts in the
larger blaze, which started Tuesday in the Cleveland National Forest.
   ``It's really picked up in its velocity,'' said Joanne Evans, a
California Division of Forestry spokeswoman. ``It's rapidly burning
in a couple of canyons.''
   In southwestern New Mexico, firefighters were mopping up a
wildfire that burned 11,770 acres of ponderosa pine trees, grass and
brush in the Gila National Forest, a U.S. Forest Service official
said.
   Another fire that burned 25,000 acres 23 miles southeast of
Animas was controlled, said Ron Henderson, fire information officer.
   Firefighters were released from the Gray Ranch fire, which burned
mainly grass and some ponderosa pine, pinon and juniper trees on
private land in Hidalgo County, Henderson said.
   Both fires were triggered by lightning June 15.
   The smaller fire, 20 miles northeast of Silver City in a rugged
are of the parched Gila, was contained at 6 p.m. Wednesday,
Henderson said.
   ``Things are cool and calm,'' he said. ``We're trying to unwind
that fire as fast as we can now. People are tired and dirty.''
   In California, the fire east of Lake Elsinore threatened Decker
Canyon and the Rancho Capistrano area. Red Cross workers set up at
Elsinore High School to take care of people who fled.
   ``The fires are coming down those hills there, but I'm not sure
how far they are,'' Evans said.
   The blaze was 35 percent controlled and officials hoped cooler
temperatures and light winds would help firefighters.
   The later fire in the Angeles National Forest blackened 1,000
acres of brush and was burning out of control, prompting the
evacuation of Green Valley, Leona Valley and Elizabeth Lake, said
John Tabak, a Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman.
   Tabak said the fire threatened other homes with flames of up to
40 feet in height.
   ``It's looking pretty bad,'' he said.
   About 300 firefighters were battling the blaze 45 miles north of
downtown Los Angeles, aided by four aerial tankers and two
helicopters.
   The larger fire, which began Tuesday, stretched along a 20-mile
front in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lake Elsinore and drew
to within a quarter-mile of about 175 small ranches at one point,
said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Nelson Dean said.
   Reinforcements were called in Wednesday to the fire, which
earlier had forced evacuation of a youth correctional facility and a
nudist camp.
   West winds were light and temperatures were in the 70s, but the
fire continued to feed on parched vegetation.
   The blaze, roaring through brush and chaparral dried by three
years of drought, was apparently caused by man, but Dean said
investigators had not determined if it was deliberately set.

<HEAD>SWAPO Accuses South Africa of Trying To Sabotage Namibia Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Namibia's main guerrilla organization
Wednesday accused South Africa of using murder and terror to
sabotage the Namibian peace process and November independence
elections.
   Sam Nujoma, president of the South West Africa People's
Organization, said Pretoria was waging a campaign against the
Namibian people despite the move towards free elections overseen by
the United Nations.
   Nujoma said special South African police units known as Koevoets
_ meaning Crowbar in Afrikaans _ were murdering and terrorizing the
black population and destroying crops.
   U.N. secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar is reported to
have told a closed meeting of the Security Council on Tuesday that
actions by Koevoet members raised grave doubts about the possibility
of free and fair elections in Namibia.
   In Windhoek on Wednesday, Louis Pienaar, the South African
administrator of the territory, said he would be happy to discuss
the presence of the Koevoet units in the Namibian security forces
with Perez de Cuellar.
   Nujoma, who intends to end his exile from Namibia soon, also
criticized South African moves to raise the age for voters from 18
to 21. He said that might reduce SWAPO's support by 30 percent.
   Though SWAPO is expected to win a majority in the elections, it
is not certain they will receive the two-thirds majority needed to
control the government.
   SWAPO has been engaged in a bush war against South African rule
of Namibia since 1966.
   Nujoma also hinted that an independent Namibia could join the
Commonwealth, the 48-nation association of Britain and its former
colonies. He said the matter was raised at the meeting.
   Asked whether Swapo would want the country to join, Nujoma
replied: ``Perhaps it would be a good idea for us to be in the
Commonwealth. We will look into that.''
   Namibia gained independence from South Africa under a
U.N.-sponsored peace plan that included the withdrawal of 50,000
Cuban troops from Angola. But the peace process almost foundered the
day it began on April 1, when more than 1,000 SWAPO guerrillas
crossed over the boarder from Angola into Namibia in violation of
the regional peace agreement.
   More than 300 guerrillas and 27 security-force members were
killed in subsequent fighting, but clashes have stopped and the
election campaign begins in July. Independence is expected to come
early next year.
   The U.N. has sponsored an airlift to repatriate 41,000 registered
Namibian refugees in time for the opening of the campaign but so
far, only 10,200 have been returned.

<TEXT>
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' is
being introduced to video stores with as little fanfare as possible
Thursday to avoid tempting the virulent protests that met its
theatrical debut, producers said.
   MCA Home Video, fearful that the movie's video release might
encourage further demonstrations and boycotts, is distributing ``The
Last Temptation'' without store displays, promotional posters or
advertising.
   So far there have been no organized demonstrations against the
video. Even so, ``The Last Temptation,'' at a suggested retail price
of $89.95, will not be sold by Blockbuster Video, the nation's
largest video-store chain.
   ``It's certainly unusual, but it was a corporate decision
considering all that went on with the film,'' said Wally Knief, a
spokesman for the Fort Lauderdale-based video chain with 343
company-owned outlets nationwide.
   It is Blockbuster's first such action against a major studio
release, Knief said, and nearly 80 percent of Blockbuster's 387
franchise locations also have indicated they won't carry the video.
   Robert Blattner, president of MCA Home Video, which is affiliated
with ``Last Temptation'' producer Universal Pictures, said his
company was taking a low-key marketing approach because it was
``conscious of provoking a new controversy, which was clearly not in
anybody's interest.''
   ``On the other hand, we're not willing to keep it on the shelf,''
Blattner said. ``We think it's important that this title be made
available in the marketplace.''
   Starring Willem Dafoe and directed by Martin Scorsese, ``The Last
Temptation'' was attacked before it appeared in theaters last August
by many fundamentalist Christian organizations. Most objected to the
depiction of Christ as a doubting messiah with human frailties and
sexual fantasies.
   A secretary for the Rev. Donald Wildmon, a conservative Christian
activist who led those attacks, said Wednesday that Wildmon was not
planning any protests against the videocassette debut, as he had
threatened to do last year.
   A number of independent stores also will not carry the cassette.
John Clark, owner of The Video Center in Gilroy, Calif., said
although he carries X-rated videos that could be considered
controversial, he would not bring in ``The Last Temptation'' for
that very reason.
   ``I just don't need the potential of the community being upset,''
Clark said. Clark said he has a separate room for the sexually
explicit movies and that he was not willing to build another room
just for ``The Last Temptation.''
   Employees of national video retailer Music Plus, which will carry
``The Last Temptation,'' have been told to tell patrons that the
chain does not have the right to censor its product line because it
would not serve customer needs.
   Although the film's opening was greeted with pickets and
vandalism, ``The Last Temptation'' was a modest hit. It has grossed
$8.2 million to date, according to Exhibitor Relations Co., and won
an Academy Award nomination for director Scorsese.
   MCA Home Video declined to say how many cassettes of ``The Last
Temptation'' it was producing, but the trade magazine Video Week
estimated that 47,000 units will be shipped.

   A judge Wednesday set an Oct. 30 trial
date for Joseph Hazelwood, who was in charge of the tanker Exxon
Valdez when it spilled 10.9 million gallons of oil off the Alaska
coast three months ago.
   The trial, initially set for June 20 and then moved to Monday,
was rescheduled again after state and defense attorneys asked Palmer
Superior Court Judge Beverly Cutler for more preparation time.
   The skipper, fired by Exxon after his ship hit a Prince William
Sound reef March 24, faces three felony counts of second-degree
criminal mischief in addition to misdemeanor charges of operating a
vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent
discharge of pollutants.
   Cutler said all charges will be considered in one trial.
   Hazelwood, who participated in the Anchorage hearing by telephone
from New York City, waived his right to a speedy trial. The
42-year-old Huntington, N.Y., man is free on $50,000 bail.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson told Cutler he expects to seek
dismissal of Hazelwood's felony indictment. He said there are at
least four reasons for dismissal, but he did not disclose them.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, revisiting an issue that drew
public outrage earlier this year, will call for a pay raise for
Congress and the abolition of fees for members' outside speeches,
but will not make specific proposals, administration officials said
Wednesday.
   Bush's proposal for salary increases for members of Congress as
well as top government officials will be included a speech Thursday
in which he will unveil proposals for tougher campaign finance laws,
said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush aides played down the salary increase, which Bush has
previously advocated, as a side issue to the packet of proposals
designed to limit special interest influence in elections.
   The White House initially planned to advance the idea of a
gradual pay increase tied to a phaseout of honoraria, the fees
members of Congress earn from speeches, said one source. But the
president decided Wednesday to leave such specifics out of his
speech, another top official said.
   ``He'll make a point that he thinks honoraria and pay raises
should be linked,'' and he will offer to work with Congress to put
together a deal, the first official said.
   Bush also decided not to propose a specific pay increase for
Congress to go along with the 25 percent raise he already is seeking
for federal judges. However, he was expected to give a number in his
call to raise top officials' salaries in the Executive Branch.
   A proposed 51 percent pay raise for Congress, government
officials and judges went down in flames earlier this year in a
backlash of public resentment. That raise would have increased
congressional salaries from $89,500 a year to $135,000.
   Bush aides noted a proposal this month by Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., that would increase salaries for members of Congress, top
executive branch officials and the judiciary by 10 percent per year
for four years. At the same time, honoraria for lawmakers would be
phased out.
   Congressmen currently augment their salaries with thousands of
dollars in speaking fees, a practice criticized as an invitation to
influence-buying. They may get $2,000 per speech, up to 30 percent
of salary in the House and 40 percent in the Senate.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., co-chairman of a House task force
already studying honoraria and other ethics issues, said Bush's
input was welcome but he doubted Congress would quickly embrace
whatever he proposes.
   ``We appreciate his willingness to get into these issues ... but
we've got to solve these matters internally,'' he said.
   Fazio said his group hoped to finish drafting a new ethics
package this year and, pay raise or not, it will be a tough sell.
   ``It's a lot easier to vote `no' and deal with the devil you
know,'' he said.
   The speech Thursday will outline the president's proposals for
election law changes. That package, according to those working on
it, will include the abolition of business and labor political
action committees, a ban on carrying over campaign funds from one
election to the next, curtailment of gerrymandering methods of
drawing political district lines, and full disclosure of so-called
``soft money'' contributions to campaigns.
   Soft money is a term used to describe funds that are raised
outside the guidelines of federal election law and that do not have
to be reported to the Federal Election Commission. The frequently
cited example is that of corporate and union funds, barred in
federal campaigns, that are given to political parties or state
groups which then help the candidates even though they are formally
independent of the campaign committees.
   Bush also will call for restrictions on franking privileges,
which allow members of Congress to send mail to their constituents
free.
   Bush has been meeting in recent weeks with members of Congress,
advocacy groups and campaign law specialists to address concerns
that special interest money plays too big a role in politics.
   Advocates of campaign changes said the president efforts wouldn't
go far enough to make a difference.
   Ellen Miller, who heads the non-profit Center For Responsive
Politics, said disclosing the sources of money will not eliminate
special interest influence. But she said, ``The very fact that he is
in this ball game, that he is clearly personally concerned and
committed to change and reform in this area is a major step.''
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a longtime advocate
of tougher election laws, said that from what he knows of Bush's
proposals, they do not solve the problems of massive campaign
spending and special-interest influence.
   He also said that Bush's plan to bar corporate and union PACs but
allow political action committees that are not tied to companies,
unions or trade associations, would leave room for continued abuse.
   But he said if Bush's action leads to bipartisan congressional
negotiations ``this could mean an enormous difference in breaking
this whole thing open.''
   Wertheimer and Miller were invited to the White House on Tuesday
to talk with Bush and his advisers about revamping the campaign
finance system.
   On the pay raise, Bush has said he wanted to distinguish the
congressional pay raise quagmire from salary increases for judges
and executive branch officials.
   In April, Bush endorsed a 25 percent pay increase for federal
judges, which is pending in Congress.
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Bush was asked about his concern
that many people have left government service for higher paying
private jobs.
   ``I want to see that remedied,'' he said. ``I still would like to
see the separation of consideration for judges and other key
executive branch posts _ I'm thinking of some of the researchers in
the NIH (the National institutes of Health) and people of this
nature. And I want to see it separated out so it doesn't get caught
on the question of congressional pay.''
   Bush endorsed the 51-percent salary increase for Congress,
executive branch officials and judges in January at his first news
conference.

   Gunshots rang out Wednesday in the coal
fields of Virginia and West Virginia, ending a lull in wildcat
walkouts by at least 37,000 miners in eight states who ignored a
federal judge's order to refrain from strike activities.
   Hundreds of United Mine Workers members from six states clogged
Virginia roads used by coal truckers for Pittston Coal Group Inc.,
the company at the heart of the wildcat sympathy strikes.
   ``These men ain't going back,'' said George Thacker, president of
United Mine Workers Local 1890 in Langsville, Ohio. ``We've got to
take a stand sometime. It might as well be now.''
   In St. Paul, Va., nearly 3,000 striking United Mine Workers and
supporters, including about 300 steel workers, rallied Wednesday
night to show the solidarity of organized labor against Pittston.
   ``We're going to hang together: We're going to win this thing, ''
UMW organization director Ron Baker said, drawing chants of ``union,
union'' from the crowd.
   Wildcat strikers from a half dozen states also joined the rally.
   ``Every union man in this country has a stake in this, said Mike
Hathaway, a wildcat striker from Steelville, Ill. ``If they break
this union, they'll break every union right on down the line.''
   Four coal trucks were peppered with gunfire in West Virginia and
Virginia, police said. No injuries were reported and no arrests were
made.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton, who has tried to bring Pittston and the
United Mine Workers together for talks, reiterated that state police
would investigate all reported violence and make arrests when
possible.
   ``The use of criminal activity by either side of the conflict in
our coal field is an intolerable response to labor-management
problems,'' he said.
   At least 37,000 union miners remained on strike Wednesday. An
additional 6,000 had been on strike, but it was unclear if they had
returned to work or were on vacation. The miners' staggered two-week
vacation periods began this week.
   The wildcat walkouts are in support of 1,900 UMW members who are
on strike against Pittston in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky
in a contract dispute. At one point, the wildcat walkouts included
46,000 miners in Missouri, West Virginia, Alabama, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia. The
miners in Missouri and Virginia have gone back to work.
   In Greenwich, Conn., outside the headquarters of The Pittston Co.
_ Pittston Coal Group's parent company _ the UMW held a memorial
Wednesday. About 350 miners, wives and children from Virginia and
Pennsylvania brought 350 small white painted wooden crosses bearing
the names of coal miners killed or injured in mine accidents.
   The UMW said it would encourage the wildcat strikers to comply
with U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp's order to refrain from strike
activities.
   Knapp said the wildcat strikes break National Labor Relations Act
guidelines against secondary strikes, and ordered UMW officials to
report to the NLRB within 10 days on what steps they have taken to
meet the court order.
   The UMW says it is not responsible for the wildcat strikes, which
violate the contract the union signed in February 1988 with the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association. The BCOA represents most
major coal operators but not Pittston.
   ``The union hasn't sanctioned the strikes, and we will do
everything we can to comply, but we feel the judge's orders really
are a slap in the face of any kind of democracy,'' said UMW District
17 official Howard Green.
   Shots were fired at coal trucks and on picket lines Thursday and
Friday for the first time since the wildcat strikes began June 12.
No one was seriously injured.
   Three trucks were shot Wednesday morning in Boone County south of
Charleston and the radiator of one truck was shot out, state police
said. The drivers, who were hauling coal for Elk Run Mining Co.,
were uninjured, said state police Sgt. Gary Bain.
   Elk Run Mining is a subsidiary of A.T. Massey Coal Co. A coal
truck driver for an A.T. Massey subsidiary was shot to death in a
1984 ambush during a 15-month UMW strike.
   In addition to those three trucks, two trucks were hit Wednesday
in the Montgomery area, southeast of Charleston, by steel balls
fired from a slingshot, state police said.
   In Virginia, a coal truck's radiator was shot out Wednesday
morning near Pittston's main coal processing plant in Russell
County, said state police spokesman Charlie Vaughan.
   A manager at a non-union mine operated by Addington Resources
Inc. of Ashland, Ky., was struck in the eye Tuesday by a rock hurled
through his truck window near Boomer, in the Montgomery area.
   In southwestern Virginia, UMW members from six states continued
to create traffic jams on coal-hauling roads Wednesday despite
facing daily fines of $120,000 from a federal judge. Hundreds of
cars and trucks slowly paraded on a narrow road linking Pittston
Coal Group's main processing plant with mines, Vaughan said.
   Virginia state police wrote 118 tickets for impeding traffic
Tuesday, only 12 of them to Virginia drivers. The rest were issued
to drivers from Indiana, West Virginia, Alabama, Illinois and
Pennsylvania.

<HEAD>Roh Opposes Demands to Cut U.S. Troops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY TUNNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said Wednesday he
firmly opposes demands by U.S. lawmakers and some of his countrymen
to reduce the number of U.S. troops in South Korea.
   He said American troops contribute to the stability of the
divided Korean peninsula, the rest of Asia and the entire Pacific
region.
   Roh, holding his first news conference for the foreign press
since becoming president, expressed concern about events in China
while also expressing hope for early restoration of ``tranquility
and stability.''
   He said the ``moderating influence'' of neighboring China on
Korea has been affected by the recent turmoil, but he did specify.
South Korea regards China, an ally of the communist north, as having
moderating influence on militant North Korea.
   Roh said South Korea's democratization has not always been easy.
``There is still unrest in this country. Our society has many issues
to solve as it moves from authoritarianism to democracy.''
   He said the economy is experiencing difficulties due to labor
demands, excessive consumption and the appreciation of the currency,
but said he was confident the economic and labor problems would be
resolved.
   Acknowledging that demands for reduction or withdrawal of 43,000
American troops come from both South Korea and Washington, he said
he is against making any change in America's commitment to keep
forces in Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   He said North Korea continues to introduce modern weapons from
the Soviet Union and deploys massive troops along the demilitarized
zone separating the two nations, which technically remain at war. A
peace treaty was never signed after the bloody 1950-53 Korean War.
   The global trend of relaxation of military tensions seen in
Europe does not apply to Korea, he said.
   Democratic lawmakers in Washington have urged a reduction in U.S.
troops in Korea, saying that the $2.6 billion spent on them could be
better used elsewhere. They say South Korea, with seven times the
gross national product of the north and twice as many people, could
afford its own defense.
   Roh said keeping troops in Korea was ``the wisest and most
economical investment'' Americans could make.
   He said dissidents and radical students demand withdrawal of U.S.
troops but that ``most Koreans share my view that America is our
best and oldest friend and ally.''
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' he said.
   Roh said North Korea has made only ``cosmetic changes'' in its
rigid isolationist policy. He repeated a call for a summit
conference with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.

<HEAD>Advocacy Group Gives State Bad Grade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new advocacy group of prominent Californians
gave their state a ``D'' grade Wednesday for the way it cares for
children.
   Children Now based its ``Children's Report Card'' on 27 factors,
including infant mortality, teen-age pregnancy and high school
graduation rates and drug use among teens, according to a press
release.
   The card, issued to coincide with the end of the school year,
graded the state in five categories. It gave a ``C'' for the status
of children's health and education, a ``D-minus'' for the teen
years, a ``D-plus'' for investing in families and a ``U'' or
unsatisfactory grade for children's safety.
   The graders were California Supreme Court Justice Allen
Broussard; Stanford University President Dr. Donald Kennedy; former
U.S. Secretary of Education Shirley Hufstedler; Garfield High School
teacher Jaime Escalante, whose life was depicted in the film ``Stand
and Deliver,'' and former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth.
   The report found that California ranked worse than the national
average in more than three-quarters of the areas it researched,
including graduation rates, children in poverty and student-teacher
ratios.
   In a few cases, the state ranked among the 10 worst states.
   ``We like to think of ourselves as the Golden State and we should
be able to do more for our kids,'' said Wendy Lazarus, vice
president for policy for the non-profit, foundation-funded group
founded in 1988.
   ``The good news in this report card is that there are some areas
that we can be proud of,'' she said. ``We really think it's a call
to action with a message that together we can do it.''
   The statistics, mostly for 1987 and 1988, were gathered from a
variety of state and federal agencies.
   ``Unfortunately, on some of the measures, there just wasn't any
information available. Nobody can tell us how many homeless children
there are in California. So we just gave an incomplete in that
category,'' Ms. Lazarus said.
   State schools chief William Honig agreed with the report's
conclusion.
   ``There is a major problem on comprehensive children's
programs,'' he said. ``There's been an explosive growth in poverty
... and we're all going to pay the price.''

   Jim Backus, the voice of cartoon
character ``Mr. Magoo'' and the fabulously wealthy Thurston Howell
III on TV's ``Gilligan's Island,'' was in serious condition Tuesday
with pneumonia, a friend said.
   Backus, 76, who has suffered from Parkinson's disease for many
years, has been treated for double pneumonia for two weeks at Saint
John's Hospital and Health Center, said Hollywood columnist Jim
Bacon, a family friend.
   His condition had been listed as critical, but was upgraded to
serious Tuesday, said family spokeswoman Kate Segal.
   ``According to his physician, he is currently listed in serious
condition, but continues to make steady progress and is responding
well to treatment,'' said Armen Markarian, director of
communications at Saint John's. ``His family is with him and he is
receiving many get-well wishes from friends and fans everywhere.''
   Backus' throaty baritone was known to millions as that of the
bumbling, nearsighted Mr. Magoo before he was introduced to
generations of television watchers on ``Gilligan's Island.'' On the
long-running series, he played Thurston Howell III, a character
developed from his Hubert Updyke, the world's richest man, on the
Alan Young radio show of the 1940s.
   A native of Cleveland, Ohio, he had roles in many movies,
including that as James Dean's father in the movie ``Rebel Without a
Cause.''
   Parkinson's disease attacks the central nervous system, causing
sufferers to lose muscular control.

<TEXT>
   Remnants of Tropical Storm Allison moved into
eastern Texas and western Louisiana on Tuesday, still dumping heavy
rain and triggering thunderstorms after hitting the Houston area
with more than 10 inches of rain.
   Torrential downpours flooded homes and streets, forcing at least
800 people into Red Cross shelters and prompting dozens of motorists
stranded on impassable freeways to leave their cars.
   At least two fatalities were blamed on Allison, which was
downgraded to a tropical depression Tuesday morning. Harris County
Sheriff's Department divers pulled a man's body from rain-swollen
Spring Creek late Tuesday. On Monday, a traffic death in the
Beaumont area was attributed to the storm.
   Two major Houston freeways _ Interstate 45 and U.S. 59 _ were
closed for more than 12 hours, blocked by high water, debris from
bayous that swamped over freeway bridges and abandoned vehicles.
   ``It's a helpless feeling,'' said stranded motorist Miles Nye.
``There's nothing you can do. You just watch the water moving up.''
   At 11 a.m. CDT, the poorly defined center of the depression was
near 30.8 north latitude and 94.7 west longitude, or about 30 miles
south of Lufkin, moving slowly to the north-northeast.
   Maximum sustained wind speed was 35 mph, with 45 mph gusts in
heavy squalls, said the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,
Fla. Because rain tends to fall to the east and north of such a
storm, the center said 5 to 10 inches of rain was possible over
extreme southeastern Texas and western Louisiana before the storm
moved into southern Arkansas.
   Although heavy rain and flooding is not unusual for Houston, the
severity of the freeway problems rivaled Hurricane Alicia, which hit
in 1983, and Tropical Storm Claudette, which dumped more than 20
inches of rain in 24 hours in 1979 and dropped a national single-day
record 43 inches in nearby Alvin.
   Before water began receding Tuesday, some underpasses had as much
as 15 or 20 feet of water. A city bus was marooned in one underpass
near downtown, its roof barely visible above water.
   In the Beaumont area, about 85 miles east of Houston, flash flood
warnings were posted for Orange, Jasper and Newton counties. Many
major streets and underpasses in the Beaumont-Port Arthur-Orange
area were flooded and drainage ditches were over their banks and
rising.
   Forecasters warned that the Sabine River, which separates Texas
from Louisiana, would rise significantly and threaten homes in the
Deweyville area, north of Beaumont. The Neches River north of
Beaumont also was likely to be out of its banks, the National
Weather Service said.
   In southwestern Louisiana, Calcasieu and Cameron parishes were
under flood warnings and Louisiana State Police reported a tornado
at Hackberry, La. No damage was reported.
   More than 10 inches of rain fell in the Houston area during the
24 hours that ended early Tuesday, according to weather service
figures. In Pasadena and Deer Park, southeastern suburbs of Houston,
more than 16 inches of rain was recorded in four days. Allison was
responsible for 12 to 14 inches of rain in Liberty County, east of
Houston.
   For the year, the nearly 39 inches of rain so far in Houston is
17 over normal.
   It was the second double-digit rainfall in the area in six weeks,
and some of the same areas hit by a May storm were hit again by
Allison.
   ``We still haven't got our insurance money from last time,'' said
Alberto Ferrer, who will have to clean up his home north of Houston
yet again.
   ``I've put my house up for sale four times but nobody wants to
buy a house under water,'' resident Harry Jones said.
   The slow-moving storm became the first named storm of the 1989
Atlantic hurricane season Monday when its maximum sustained wind
speed reached 39 mph. It came ashore in Brazoria County, south of
Houston, and then inched its way through southeast Texas at about 5
mph.

<HEAD>Hearings Open on Two Spills; Hot Weather Threatens Delaware Cleanup</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `Yost said...,' to CORRECT press secretary's
name to Welsh, sted Walsh.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rising temperatures melted globs of congealed oil in the Delaware
River on Tuesday, complicating efforts to remove the oil spilled
from a tanker, and hearings opened into two other oil spills in
Texas and Rhode Island.
   A harbor pilot testified he radioed three warnings to the tanker
World Prodigy before it hit a reef and spilled 420,000 gallons of
oil off the Rhode Island coast. A Coast Guard officer said the
tanker's captain apparently used the wrong chart to plot his course.
   In Texas, the pilot of a tanker that collided with a barge in the
Houston Ship Channel testified Tuesday that his vessel didn't react
as expected just before the accident that ruptured the barge and
spilled 250,000 gallons of oil. He said sediment buildup in a
channel may have kept him from making a turn.
   In Delaware, Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul A. Yost called
Tuesday to promise more action, said a spokesman for Gov. Michael
Castle, who has complained that the cleanup has been far too slow.
   Yost said he would put more resources into the cleanup
immediately, said Castle's press secretary, Jeff Welsh. Yost also
promised to put a command post on location, wherever it will do the
most good.
   ``The message from the admiral is this: If the governor isn't
happy, the admiral isn't happy,'' Welsh said.
   Delaware officials, including Castle, filed suit in federal court
seeking unspecified damages against the country of Uruguay, the
owner of the tanker.
   Coast Guard officials had said they hoped more than 500 people
would be involved in the Delaware cleanup Tuesday. But Roger A.
Lucio of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and
Environmental Control said 207 National Guard and private contractor
employees were working along with 100 federal government workers. In
Philadelphia, Coast Guard spokesman David Oney said Delaware was
sending 150 more Guardsmen.
   The Coast Guard reduced its estimate of the spill Tuesday, saying
about 306,000 gallons of heavy oil, down from 800,000 gallons,
spilled into the river Saturday when the Uruguayan tanker Presidente
Rivera ran aground.
   Unlike the lighter oil spilled in Rhode Island and Texas, and the
crude oil that leaked March 24 in Alaska, the oil coagulated in the
cool water into chunks ranging in size from a basketball to two or
three feet.
   Cleanup workers had been using pitchforks and even their hands to
snare the globs from the water because skimmers were jammed by the
larger chunks. About 64,000 gallons had been recovered as of Tuesday.
   But on Tuesday, the temperature headed out of the 80s and into
the 90s, the melting range for the No. 6 industrial heating oil.
   ``When we've got it in chunks, we can pick it up,'' said Coast
Guard Capt. Larry Murdock.
   Liquefied oil poses a much greater hazard to shoreline and to
wildlife, Murdock said.
   During an inspection tour, officials pointed to patches where the
rainbow hue of petroleum on water showed up and said it was coming
from oil blobs close enough to the surface to heat and melt.
   Until Tuesday, only a short stretch of shoreline had been tainted
in Delaware. Injuries to wildlife were limited to 25 Canada geese,
which were being cleaned at the Tri State Bird Rescue Center in
Wilmington, Del. A 26th goose died. An additional 50 geese spattered
with oil were trapped in a lagoon near Wilmington.
   In Providence, R.I., pilot David G. Leonard, 55, told a Coast
Guard-National Transportation Safety Board hearing that pleasure
boat radio traffic may have kept his warnings to the tanker World
Prodigy from being understood. He said vital radio channels should
be freed because pleasure boat interference is common during summer.
   Virtually all the No. 2 heating oil spilled in Friday's accident
had dissipated by Tuesday and state officials began reopening
beaches.
   Coast Guard Lt. Paul Cormier said the World Prodigy's captain,
Iakavos Georgudis, acknowledged seeing a buoy that warns traffic
away from Brenton Reef but said: ``I turned the ship too late.''
   Cormier said Georgudis was not using a chart with enough detail
to show the buoy or water depth and said the captain turned the
ship, with a 36-foot draft, into 30 feet of water.
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, who met the captain on a Coast Guard
vessel hours after the accident, asked him why there was no pilot
aboard. ``He said, `That was my mistake.' He made no bones about
it,'' DiPrete said.
   Authorities are investigating whether the ship was past the point
where state law required a pilot on board.
   The investigating panel, however, was blocked from hearing
testimony from the ship's helmsman, Konstadinos A. Paraskevopulos,
when his attorney, Lise J. Gescheidt, advised him to invoke his
right against self-incrimination.
   Capt. David H. Whitten, who is leading the investigation for the
Coast Guard, said he was working with the U.S. attorney's office to
grant Paraskevopulos immunity. The helmsman, who speaks no English,
appeared with a Greek translator.
   U.S. Attorney Lincon Almond indicated the request would be
granted.
   ``He could be important to the inquiry and he could be important
to any criminal prosecutions,'' the prosecutor said.
   Almond said the captain would not be granted immunity, however,
because he was the target of a criminal investigation.
   In Texas, about a dozen huge vacuum machines and regular vacuum
machines were at work pumping oil from the Bayport Channel, where
much of the 250,000 gallons of oil spilled into the Houston Ship
Channel was funneled to help in the cleanup, Coast Guard spokesman
Bob Morehead said. Cleanup crews by Tuesday had collected 4,300
barrels of oil from the water, Morehead said.
   Tanker pilot Michael Gale said he was trying to make a right turn
from the Bayport Channel into the Ship Channel, but the tanker
continued straight ahead and collided with the barge Friday.
   ``My only opinion is, she didn't have enough water underneath her
keel,'' Gale said. ``It could have been caused by too much sediment
in the channel.''
   Gale, a pilot for 12 years, said he has made 2,700 trips in the
channel.

<HEAD>Opposition Lawmaker Arrested for Unauthorized Trip to North Korea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security agents Wednesday arrested an
opposition lawmaker for making an unauthorized, secret visit to
Pyongyang for an interview with North Korea's leader.
   Officials of the Agency for National Security Planning said Suh
Kyung-won, of South Korea's largest opposition Party, Peace and
Democracy, was charged with violating South Korea's National
Security Law.
   The law provides for a maximum of the death penalty and a minimum
of five years imprisonment for such an illegal trip to the north.
   The announcement said Suh visited the communist north Aug. 19-21
last year via Prague, Czechoslovakia after contacting North Korean
agents in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   While in the north, Suh met with Kim Il Sung and Ho Dam, chairman
of North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Unification of the
Fatherland, on national unification and other issues.
   Newspapers said that Suh had kept his clandestine visit to the
north secret but began considering surrendering to authorities after
dissident leader Rev. Moon Ik-hwan was arrested in April for his
unauthorized visit to the north. Moon is now on trial for violating
the security law.
   Meanwhile, a national student group said Tuesday it will defy a
government ban and march to communist North Korea for a youth
festival.
   The chairman of the radical National Council of Student
Representatives, Im Chong-suk said he expects 15,000 students to
congregate at Seoul's Hanyang University for a march Friday, the eve
of the festival. The World Youth Festival will be held in North
Korea's capital, Pyongyang, July 1-8.
   Prosecutors said they issued warrants for the arrest of Im and
two other leaders of the radical student group, charging them with
violating the security law by talking on the telephone with North
Korean students.
   Seoul accuses Pyongyang of using the festival to stir up
dissident movements in South Korea _ a charge the North Korean
government denies. The festival is a political and sports event
attended mostly by youths from the Third World and communist bloc.
   In Tokyo, officials said representatives of Japan's governing
Liberal Democratic Party and its largest opposition party left
Tuesday for North Korea via Beijing to attend the youth festival in
North Korea. They were also to hold talks with the Pyongyang
government toward improving relations.
   South and North Korea have been bitter rivals since their land
was divided at the end of World War II. North Korea invaded the
south in 1950 and the three-year Korean War left more than l million
dead on both sides. A truce was never signed.

<HEAD>Eds: Subs 5th graf, `The prince...,' to clarify that Romanov was
10 at time of Bolshevik revolution.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOODSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Vasili Romanov, the last Russian
prince born in Russia before the Bolshevik revolution, has died at
the age of 81, hopeful to the end that new freedom dawned in his
homeland.
   Marina Beadleston of Aspen, Colo., said her father, a nephew of
Emperor Nicholas II, died in bed of natural causes Saturday in the
Woodside home where he lived for 25 years.
   Romanov's mother was Grand Duchess Xenia, sister of the last
czar. His father was Grand Duke Alexander, the czar's cousin and
founder of the Russian air force. His grandfather was Czar Alexander
III. His great-uncles were the kings of England, Greece and Denmark.
   ``It's a very exciting time we live in,'' Romanov said in a
recent interview about the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev. Romanov
hoped they meant new freedom for the people his family ruled from
1613 to 1917.
   The prince, born in a 1,000-room palace, was 10 years old when
the Bolsheviks took power. He and his family survived the
assassinations of the czar, his wife and their five children, and
were rescued by a British battleship sent by their British relative,
King George V.
   Later, young Romanov took to sea as a cabin boy. He also toiled
as a shipyard worker and stockbroker in San Francisco, as a
winemaker near San Jose, and a chicken farmer in Sonoma.
   ``In my colorful career, I think I enjoyed the chicken farm the
most,'' he said.
   As he grew older, he tired of questions about the Soviet Union,
what had become of it and what he thought of it. He said he could
have returned as a tourist _ but never would return ``under the
Bolsheviks ... everything we detested.''
   Romanov is survived by his daughter and four grandchildren.
Services will be July 7, his birthday, in Holy Trinity Cathedral in
San Francisco.

   Gov. Steve Cowper on Tuesday offered to
share the lessons Alaska has learned from the nation's worst oil
spill with five states affected by a recent rash of spills.
   ``I stand ready to offer you Alaska's expertise learned the hard
way from three months on the front lines of North America's largest
oil spill,'' Cowper said in letters sent to the states' governors.
   He referred to the March 24 Exxon Valdez spill, which polluted
Alaska's Prince William Sound with nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil. The cleanup of that spill ``is in no way over,'' he said.
   Copwer also asked the governors of Delaware, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas to help him push for federal
legislation to prevent spills and improve the nation's ability to
respond to them.
   He outlined his proposals for improving tanker safety and
spill-response capabilities.
   ``It is clear that the industry, from producers to shippers, does
not have the equipment, expertise or technology to mount an
effective response in a critically short period of time,'' Cowper
said.
   The United States should adopt the advanced technology of other
oil-producing nations, especially Norway and the Soviet Union, which
provided Alaska with expert help after the Exxon Valdez spill, he
said.
   Alaska's governor noted that federal law allows the party
responsible for the spill to direct the cleanup until it is either
unwilling or unable to do so.
   ``The public shouldn't have to wait for a spiller to quit or
fail. We should have the ability to act quickly without worrying
about emptying federal or state treasuries,'' Cowper wrote.

   A federal judge Tuesday ordered an end
to wildcat strikes by nearly 43,000 coal miners in nine states,
saying they are violating U.S. labor law.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp said the walkout by United Mine
Workers members violated National Labor Relations Act guidelines
against secondary boycotts. The walkout began June 12 in support of
1,900 UMW members who have been on strike against The Pittston Coal
Group since April 5.
   Knapp issued a temporary injunction at the request of the
National Labor Relations Board. The judge stopped short of forcing
the miners back on the job, but said union officials must report to
the NLRB within 10 days on what steps they have taken to meet the
court order.
   UMW President Richard Trumka said union officials ``do not
believe an injunction is warranted in this case.''
   ``These work stoppages are not sanctioned by the union and the
international has requested the affected members to return to
work,'' Trumka said in a prepared statement. ``We will take the
necessary steps to comply with the court's order as we review the
next legal steps.''
   Gov. Gaston Caperton applauded Knapp's order.
   ``It's so important to get people back to work. Everybody's
interested in finding new ways to finding a solution to this
problem,'' Caperton said in Huntington, where he attended an
economic development seminar.
   Knapp ordered the UMW to stop any activities that might cause
miners to continue to strike and to halt any threats or coercion
against the coal companies.
   He also told the UMW to inform miners that union officials have
no objection to their return to work, and that miners would not be
disciplined by the union for resuming work.
   There were no immediate reports of strikers heeding the order.
But most began their two-week vacations this week, and the coal
fields have been relatively quiet since the weekend.
   Earlier in the walkout, there were rowdy and sometimes violent
attempts by miners to block replacement workers and coal trucks as
miners ignored previous back-to-work court orders.
   Jim Strickland, director of public relations for The Drummond
Co., one of Alabama's largest coal producers, said the company was
pleased with the court order.
   ``The international union will now notify its members that they
should return to work at companies such as ours that have no labor
disputes in question,'' Strickland said in a statement. ``In light
of this order, Drummond fully expects its UMWA employees to report
to work.''
   The Bituminous Coal Operators Association claims the UMW is
violating a no-strike clause contained in a national contract signed
in February 1988. Pittston refused to sign the association contract,
claiming that as the nation's largest coal exporter it needed more
flexibility to deal with foreign competition.
   About 1,600 UMW miners in Virginia and West Virginia struck
Pittston after working 14 months without a contract. They were
joined by 300 Pittston miners in Kentucky earlier this month.
   The judge could have restricted the back-to-work order to West
Virginia and parts of Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio, but ordered that
it apply nationwide to all coal companies that have UMW contracts.
   At one point, 46,000 miners in Missouri, West Virginia, Alabama,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and
Virginia were off the job. Missouri's miners went back to work on
Monday.

<HEAD>Fresh Scandal Over Prime Minister's Affairs With Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new scandal ignited Wednesday as Prime Minister
Sousuke Uno, already suffering from allegations of an affair with a
former geisha, was hit with reports of two other liaisons.
   The reports, which appeared in a popular women's magazine, Josei
Jishin, alleged that Uno had affairs with a hostess in the Ginza
entertainment district from 1962 to 1972 and with a geisha from 1975
to 1984.
   Before the magazine hit the stands Wednesday, rumors that Uno was
considering resigning, less than a month after taking office on June
2, reflected in overseas financial markets and surfaced in the
Japanese press.
   Top stories in major national newspapers said leaders of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party held an emergency meeting Tuesday
night and persuaded Uno to stay in office.
   According to reports in Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun and
Yomiuri Shimbun, among other newspapers, Uno told advisers the
reports of womanizing insulted his dignity. He said they made it
difficult for him to meet other world leaders at such forums as the
Paris summit in July.
   On Wednesday, Uno denied reports that he expressed desire to
resign over the scandals.
   ``I did't say such a thing,'' Uno told reporters, referring to
the reports.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun quoted sources close to
the prime minister as saying: ``If I am troubling you further, I
must resign.
   ``I cannot manage my job, receiving such an insult. ... I didn't
become prime minister because I wanted to,'' Yomiuri quoted Uno as
saying.
   But Mainichi said Uno also said: ``I will not resign for awhile
whatever happens.''
   Uno told a group of legislators and businessmen attending a trade
meeting Wednesday that he would attend the Paris summit of major
industrial powers.
   ``As Japan's representative, I must discuss important issues with
leaders from other countries,'' an official of the Prime Minister's
Office quoted Uno as saying.
   The scandals come as the Liberal Democrats, who have ruled Japan
for 34 years, struggle to regroup after the resignation of Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, who left office after being linked to the
Recruit influence-peddling scandal, which tainted many of the
party's elite.
   The scandal is widely expected to hurt the party in an election
this weekend for the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly and in voting next
month for half the seats in Parliament's upper house.
   Uno, when questioned in Parliament, refused to comment on earlier
reports he paid a geisha to be his mistress in 1985, saying it was a
private matter.
   After a setback for the ruling party in a by-election Sunday,
however, he acknowledged rumors of womanizing had added to damage
done to the party by the Recruit scandal.
   Uno was foreign minister until he was drafted on June 2 to be
prime minister, ending the party's search for a politician with a
clean image to help it overcome the widespread Recruit scandal.
   The report in Josei Jishin claimed that Uno began his affair with
the Ginza hostess, identified in the article only as Ms. Y, 50,
several years after he was first elected to Parliament in 1960.
   It said the other geisha, who also was not named, met Uno once a
week from 1975 to 1984 and was paid the equivalent of about $700 a
month.
   On Sunday, a former geisha appeared on television to say she was
paid by Uno to be his mistress in 1985. Mitsuko Nakanishi, 40,
claimed that under a contract with her geisha house, Uno paid the
equivalent of $14,280 to the house and $7,140 to her, in addition to
monthly payments of $2,100 over four months.
   Contrary to their reputation overseas, real geisha are not
prostitutes, but are highly trained entertainers well versed in the
arts and in conversation. Most work in traditional Japanese
restaurants, often frequented by politicians and businessmen. Some
become mistresses of favored patrons.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dorothy Stimson Bullitt, grande dame of Pacific
Northwest television and founder of the KING Broadcasting Co., died
of heart failure Tuesday at her home at age 97.
   Mrs. Bullitt, heiress to a real-estate fortune, was a leading
figure in the city's business and cultural life for more than 50
years.
   Widowed in 1932, she raised three children alone and took over
the Bullitt family's real estate business.
   In 1947, she founded King Broadcasting, purchased a local AM and
FM radio station, KEVR, and changed the call letters to KING, after
King County.
   Mrs. Bullitt ran the outfit with fierce independence, vowing
never to sell air time to religious organizations. That ban remains
in place at KING Television, which she purchased for $375,000 from a
Merrill Lynch employee who had built Channel 5 himself and put it on
the air on Thanksgiving Day, 1948.
   The Federal Communications Commission placed a temporary ban on
the establishment of new stations while resolving problems with
transmission, giving KING a five-year monopoly as the only
television station west of the Mississippi and north of San
Francisco. It showed programming from all three networks.
   ``That was what made us,'' Mrs. Bullitt once said in a published
interview. The station is now an NBC affiliate.
   KING Broadcasting today owns four television and six radio
stations, including KGW-TV in Portland, Ore. and KREM TV and radio
in Spokane.
   Mrs. Bullitt retired as company president in 1962 but remained
honorary chairman of the board. She was replaced as president by her
son, Stimson Bullitt, an attorney who was succeeded at the station
by Ancil Payne in 1971.
   Mrs. Bullitt, born in Seattle, was the second of two children of
a mill owner and real estate tycoon, C.D. Stimson, who moved to
Seattle early in the year of the Great Fire of 1889.
   At 18 , she married Alexander Scott Bullitt, a Democrat who later
ran for the U.S. Senate and the governor of Washington, but lost
both races in what was then a strongly Republican state.
   He died in 1932 of cancer of the liver, leaving Mrs. Bullitt and
three children: Charles Stimson; Priscilla, known as Patsy, and
Harriet, owner of Pacific Northwest magazine.
   Mrs. Bullitt, then 40, took charge as the sole person responsible
for managing her share of a large estate.
   She served on the boards of the Seattle Art Museum, the
University of Washington, Children's Hospital, Pacific University,
Seattle Public Library and Seattle Symphony. She was also one of
five founding members of the Code Board of the National Association
of Broadcasters in the 1950s.
   Survivors include her son and two daughters, 10 grandhildren and
10 great-grandchildren.

   The House will not rush to nullify a Supreme
Court decision on flag-burning, says House Speaker Thomas Foley, who
contends the issue should not be used for ``crass political
purposes.''
   Moving Tuesday to slow down a possible stampede for
constitutional change, Foley announced that hearings will be held in
July on setting aside the court ruling that threw out flag
desecration laws in 48 states.
   He acted only hours after President Bush joined a chorus of
lawmakers in proclaiming that a constitutional amendment _ a process
used only 26 times in the nation's history _ is the only solution to
change the 5-4 ruling.
   Foley, D-Wash., said the House Judiciary Committee hearings ``are
not going to be rushed but they will not be obstructive.'' They will
``be conducted calmly in the spirit of deliberation and care ... we
are not seeking to inflame this issue,'' he told reporters.

   President Bush seems more interested in defending
the flag than defending the ideas the flag represents, say civil
rights leaders who heard a speech by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   In his address Tuesday to Operation PUSH, Thornburgh said the
Bush administration wouldn't immediately pursue legislation to
overturn controversial U.S. Supreme Court rulings on job
discrimination.
   Thornburgh said the administration wanted to first assess the
impact of the high court rulings on anti-discrimination laws.
   Jesse Jackson, founder of the Chicago-based Operation PUSH,
expressed disappointment with Thornburgh's ``wait-and-see'' message.
He and others contrasted it with Bush's immediate call for a
constitutional amendment to set aside last week's Supreme Court
ruling nullifying flag desecration laws in 48 states.
   ``We cannot help but notice the haste with which Bush has rushed
to defend the flag, and his lack of haste in defending the substance
that flag stands for, which is equality under the law and
fairness,'' Jackson said after Thornburgh's speech.

   President Bush is weighing proposals to curb
special-interest influence in political campaigns, and an aide says
he also may act to keep track of Congress members' efforts to
influence executive branch policy.
   Bush is to announce on Thursday his proposals to revise the
campaign funding laws. He is expected to call for abolition of
special-interest political action committees that pour millions of
dollars into the war chests of federal candidates.
   In addition to the election law reform, the president is
considering a proposal to log calls from Congress members trying to
sway officials' decisions, said one official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The president indicated in a news conference Tuesday that he has
not made his final decisions. He is to announce his proposals in a
speech to a group of congressional interns at the Library of
Congress.

   A new state law that allows police to
withhold the names of crime victims went into effect quietly earlier
this month but is creating an uproar.
   The law, which amends the Texas Open Records Act, allows
government agencies to keep confidential the identities of victims
of felonies, including homicide.
   Police also can withhold information that could lead to victims'
identification, such as addresses. The bill went into effect June 14.
   Generally, the news media voluntarily withholds the names only of
victims of sex crimes.
   ``I think the law is outrageous and I hope law enforcement
agencies will choose to ignore it until this serious challenge to
freedom of information can be corrected,'' Jack Loftis, editor and
vice president of the Houston Chronicle, said in a telephone
interview Tuesday.

   Carrie Bray was looking for real-life

Texan got was a peek inside the ``Howdy Wagon'' parked in front of
the chamber of commerce.
   ``There's got to be some cowboys around here somewhere,'' the
Dallas teen-ager said during a recent visit with her mother.
   Sorry. Tourists lured to Cheyenne to ``Live the Legend'' are
finding there's little legend to live in the southeastern Wyoming
city of 47,000 residents.
   City officials know they're letting tourists down and admit they
might be deceiving them with the advertising slogan.
   ``Can they `Live the Legend?' No,'' said Mayor Gary Schaeffer.
``As soon as people start making up slogans, there's a perception of
problems or they wouldn't need a slogan. We have to give them what
they need to live it.''
   Realizing the western deficiency of the Cowboy State's capital,
civic leaders are beefing up frontier activities and sinking
thousands of dollars into marketing surveys and tourist promotions.

<HEAD>As Congress Turns to New Farm Bill, Changes May Come Slowly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 1985 farm law will expire at the end of
1990 after a five-year run. Reviews are mixed, but it's doubtful
that Capitol Hill critics will force a major rewrite of the
hackneyed old script.
   For one thing, the law _ properly, the Food Security Act of 1985
_ allowed the Agriculture Department to reduce some of the subsidies
and price formulas tied to certain commodities such as wheat, corn
and cotton.
   The law and USDA decisions it permitted have effectively reduced
some of the high price supports that many economists say had priced
the United States out of international export markets. With lower
prices, U.S. grain has been better able to compete, they say.
   But much of the 1985 farm law resembles its ancestors going back
to the 1930s by authorizing production controls when deemed
appropriate, and providing basic price supports to designated
commodities.
   Despite a mathematical chance of an ideological upheaval in
Congress over farm policy and whether to get the government out of
the commodity markets once and for all, the odds greatly favor a
continuation of the present system _ with a little tinkering here
and there.
   And guess what? Even if Congress fails to write a new farm bill,
the government programs would simply revert to ``permanent
legislation'' written in 1949 and 1933.
   Susan L. Pollack of the department's Economic Research Service
says the issues currently facing lawmakers include ways of cutting
costs, more flexibility for crop plantings, trade liberalization,
food safety, environmental concerns, rural development, nutrition
and hunger, and research.
   The Bush administration and many members of Congress have
expressed satisfaction with the 1985 farm law, despite some record
outlays for commodity programs, she said.
   In fiscal 1984, spending by USDA's Commodity Credit Corp. on
various programs, including feed grains, wheat, rice, cotton,
tobacco, dairy, soybeans, honey, wool and disaster assistance,
totaled about $7.3 billion.
   Spending in 1985 rose to $17.7 billion, and in 1986, climbed to a
record of more than $25.8 billion. Costs dropped to $22.4 billion in
1987, to $12.5 billion in 1988, and are expected to edge up to $13.8
billion in 1989. The forecast for 1990 currently is $11.6 billion,
less than half the earlier peak.
   ``Strong pressure to cut domestic spending, however, will
continue to force lawmakers to scrutinize farm program costs,''
Pollack said in the July issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
``Cost-cutting proposals have included further reductions in target
prices (used to determine subsidies, or ``deficiency'' payments to
farmers), setting target prices to reflect the costs of production,
and establishing more flexible acreage bases.''
   A so-called triple-base concept advocated since 1985 by Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, would give farm participants the option
of planting a crop of their choice on part of their acreage base
without losing acreage credit.
   Pollack said the concept would continue to divide a farmer's
total crop base into ``permitted acreage'' and acreage idled under
the Acreage Reduction Program, or ARP. But the permitted acreage
would be divided further into a base for program crops that would
continue to be eligible for federal payments, and a ``flexible''
base.
   Crops produced on the flexible base would not be eligible for
deficiency payments.
   ``Proponents hope the triple base concept would decrease federal
expenses by cutting the number of acres receiving payments, while
giving farmers more flexibility as to what they can plant,'' she
said. ``And the triple base would continue the movement toward a
more market-oriented agriculture.''
   One of the heavyweight issues for 1990 farm legislation continues
to be agricultural trade. U.S. farm exports, in the doldrums a few
years ago, have improved substantially, partly because of aggressive
overseas selling policies, including export subsidies to offset
similar competition from the European Economic Community.
   ``Congressional observers expect the new farm bill to continue
boosting U.S. farm exports with targeted subsidies and to keep the
pressure on other nations for trade reforms,'' Pollack said.
   Meanwhile, if current trade negotiations under the Uruguay Round
are successful, the new farm bill would have to be amended to
reflect such changes. Those amendments to the 1990 farm law,
however, would take place after negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are completed.
   Some other issues that Pollack said are becoming more important
to farm bill debate:
   _Food safety and groundwater contamination. Recent concerns about
the chemical Alar used on apples are examples, along with continued
problems with poultry and meat inspection. Establishing seafood
inspection, and the labeling of food products to disclose more
information about cholesterol, sodium, fat and calorie content of
food are other possible issues.
   _Low-input agriculture, which calls for less chemical fertilizers
and pesticides. One bill, by Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., would use
cash incentives and tax breaks to encourage farmers to voluntarily
review farm chemical use, and to cut back where possible.
   _Rural development. Many bills have been introduced to improve
rural health services, education, transportation and water systems.
A comprehensive bill by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., includes loans
and grant programs that would involve all levels of government and
the private sector.
   _Crop insurance. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has told
Congress the program needs to be overhauled. The administration also
says drought-relief legislation forces the taxpayer to subsidize
those farmers who choose not to buy crop insurance.
   _Sugar program. Critics say the system of limiting imports of
sugar through quotas to maintain higher domestic prices should be
changed. Defenders say it has worked well to protect U.S. sugar
interests and the American consumer.

   Buzz Aldrin laments that ``the
promise of Apollo was never fulfilled,'' that the American space
program languished after he and Neil Armstrong left the first human
footprints on the moon two decades ago.
   He says he hopes the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 will ``become
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human
expansion outward.''
   But given today's political and tight budgetary climate, Aldrin
is not too hopeful.
   President Bush is expected to voice continuing support for a
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about
NASA's program when he meets with Aldrin, Armstrong and their
command module pilot, Michael Collins, on July 20, the anniversary
of the moon landing.
   But no matter how many nice things the president says about
space, the political truth is that Congress must approve the money.
And with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut,
Congress is not expected to give much support to new projects.
   So the National Aeronautics and Space Administration once again
is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended.
   President John F. Kennedy had committed this nation to landing a
man on the moon in the 1960s. The goal was to gain space superiority
over the Soviet Union, whose early feats had earned the Russians
worldwide respect and shocked Americans.
   When the United States won the race to the moon, NASA laid out
bold plans for the future.
   To a presidential panel, agency head Thomas Paine in 1969
proposed a 12-man space station and a reusable space shuttle in
operation as early as 1976, followed by a station in moon orbit, a
base on the moon, a 50-man space station in Earth orbit and a manned
mission to Mars in the 1980s.
   But in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and
involvement in Vietnam, costly plans to explore space were given low
priority.
   Only the reuseable space shuttle survived, and its proposed
funding was cut deeply.
   ``Those were tough times,'' said Paine, who resigned in
frustration a year after Apollo 11.
   The Ford and Carter administrations were lukewarm toward the
space program, but the shuttle was built. It performed capably as a
space truck for 24 missions until Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger
exploded, killing its seven crew members and grounding the program
for 32 months.
   NASA had gained some hope from President Reagan's endorsement of
a strong space program and from his 1984 State of the Union message,
in which he backed building the space station Freedom.
   In 1985, Congress created a commission to define long-term space
goals. Its chief was Thomas Paine, the former NASA administrator.
   Six months after Challenger, Paine stood in the Oval Office and
gave Reagan a slick leather-bound volume that recommended the space
station, a lunar base and manned trips to Mars _ essentially an
update of Paine's 1969 plan.
   Reagan two years later signed a Presidential Directive on
National Space Policy that stated space leadership was a fundamental
objective. It endorsed the space station and, without being
specific, set a long-range goal ``to expand human presence and
activity beyond Earth orbit into the solar system.''
   Reagan's policy set in motion a NASA program named Pathfinder
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic
exploration of the moon and planets, advanced missions in orbit and
on planetary surfaces, extended human presence in space, and space
transportation to the moon and planets.
   Bush has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a
space station. He established the National Space Council, headed by
Vice President Dan Quayle, to recommend a comprehensive space policy.
   Quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for Bush's
anniversary meeting with the Apollo 11 astronauts.
   NASA needs a decision from Congress soon on how much money it can
spend next year on space station Freedom. A permanent orbiting space
station is essential to those ambitious Pathfinder dreams and would
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into
space.
   Bush has requested $2.05 billion in the budget for fiscal 1990 to
continue work on the station. Predictions are that Congress will
trim that by $400 million to $700 million, amounts that space
officials say could further delay or even kill the project.
   The space station project has gone through five tumultuous years.
Reagan wanted it built in cooperation with America's major allies,
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10
European nations, Japan and Canada agreed to invest nearly $8
billion to build sections of it.
   NASA said in 1984 it could begin launching segments of the
orbiting laboratory in 1992 and estimated the U.S. cost at $8
billion. In 1987, agency officials revised the pricetag to $14.6
billion. The new figure covered a suddenly scaled-down Phase One,
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment
modules would be attached. The struts would be added in orbit under
Phase Two.
   Shortly after that, a National Research Council panel reviewing
station costs and technical issues for the White House said the
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be $25.02
billion, with Phase Two raising the cost to $32.8 billion.
   The schedule began slipping. And NASA now says if it receives the
proper funding, it could begin assembling the station in 1995.
   Some in Congress believe NASA should alter its plans and build a
less complex station and, instead of relying totally on the space
shuttle, develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting
job.
   Orbiting at 250 miles, Freedom would be home to a crew of eight,
with astronauts rotating back to Earh after four to six months.
   The station would allow humans to study the stars and planets
from the pollution-free environment of space. The weightless
interior would permit manufacture of new, contamination-free
medicines and other products impossible to create on Earth.
Astronauts would assemble, service and repair satellites and send
them out into space. And the station could eventually be the staging
point for man's return to the moon or a journey to Mars.
   No one can predict whether these grand plans will come about, but
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary Apollo 11 flight to
the moon 20 years ago think they should.
   ``A permanent presence in space is a worthy objective, and I hope
that space station Freedom becomes a reality,'' Neil Armstrong said
recently.
   ``I strongly endorse the station, a scientific base on the moon
and eventually manned flights to Mars,'' said Buzz Aldrin.
   Michael Collins, who orbited the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin
walked its surface, envisioned setting up a colony on Mars.
   ``We're a nation of explorers,'' he said. ``We started on the
East Coast, we went to the West Coast, and then vertically. Starting
with the Wright brothers, Chuck Yeager through the sound barrier,
Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon.
   ``It's in our tradition, it's in our culture.''

   While America marks the 20th
anniversary of man's landing on the moon, NASA has on its wish list
a permanent scientific lunar outpost early next century.
   When astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot in the
lunar dust July 20, 1969, some scientists saw it as a logical step
toward building a research base there.
   But no overwhelming public or political support developed for
such an expensive undertaking, and blueprints were shelved.
   Some scientists continued through the years to yearn for a moon
base. Mineral-rich lunar soil could support crops grown under
pressurized domes, researchers say, and a commercially valuable gas,
prevalent on the moon, could be returned to Earth where it is rare.
   The scientists have a glimmer of hope in a document released last
December by NASA's Office of Exploration, ``Beyond Earth's Horizons
_ Human Exploration of the Solar System in the 21st Century.'' It
outlined possibilities for two moon bases among four potential
manned expeditions. The other two involve flights to the Martian
moon Phobos and to Mars itself.
   One of the moon bases envisioned would not be permanently
staffed. It would serve chiefly as an astronomy laboratory where
telescopes, free of the Earth's obscuring atmosphere and interfering
electronic transmissions, could study the most distant radioemitting
galaxies and search for extraterrestrial life.
   The exploration office plan puts this unmanned base on the moon's
far side, which is permanently hidden from Earth. Each of four
successive four-person crews would work through a 14-day lunar day,
setting up equipment delivered by unmanned cargo vehicles, before
returning to Earth or an orbiting space station as a 14-day night
begins. Staying through a frigid lunar night would require
considerable extra support equipment.
   Once the observatory is built the telescopes would operate
automatically, sending images and data to Earth through a satellite
orbiting the moon, or the ground could direct them to look at
certain celestial objects.
   Astronauts would return to the base every three years to service
the equipment and to collect and replace telescope film.
   The second base, on the front side of the moon, would be
permanently manned.
   Many astronaut crews over several years would be required to
construct an Antarctic-type facility, using raw building materials
already there. The Apollo missions disclosed that every shovelful of
lunar soil is rich in metals and silicon and that this soil can be
mixed with water to form a type of cement.
   Oxygen is the most abundant element on the moon, and this can be
combined with hydrogen to make water. Because oxygen is five-sixths
of what rocket engines burn, the base could also serve as a tank
farm for spacecraft flying between Earth and the moon or embarking
for Mars or elsewhere in the solar system.
   A lunar resource of potentially great commercial value is
helium-3, an isotope of helium with three atomic nuclei instead of
the more common two. Physicists see it as a cleaner, more efficient
alternative to the fuels foreseen for conventional fusion reactors
to generate electrical power.
   On Earth, helium-3 exists only in very small quantities as a
by-product of nuclear weapons production. But on the moon it is
abundant, deposited by the sun's charged particles.
   Studies done by the Fusion Technology Institute at the University
of Wisconsin and NASA indicate that as little as 40,000 pounds of
helium-3 could be transported to Earth on just two lunar return
trips. Used in a national array of fusion reactors, this amount
could supply the energy needs of the United States for a year.
   The exploration office study says either or both moon bases could
be started early in the next century. The report did not include
expedition costs, but Frank Martin, chief of the office, said,
``It's clear that in order to do these things you are going to have
to spend more money, a larger percentage of the federal budget.''

   Twelve men, all Americans, walked on
the moon in those heady days of Apollo exploration. Their fame was
fleeting and their names today are mostly dim memories.
   Neil Armstrong earned a place in history 20 years ago when he
became the first human to leave his footprints in the ancient lunar
dust.
   The rest, in order: Buzz Aldrin, Charles Conrad Jr., Alan L.
Bean, Alan B. Shepard Jr., Edgar D. Mitchell, David R. Scott, James
B. Irwin, John W. Young, Charles M. Duke Jr., Eugene A. Cernan and
Harrison H. Schmitt.
   Each was affected profoundly by his stay on the moon and the
perspective it gave them of Earth.
   ``My impression was of the importance of that small, fragile,
remote blue planet,'' Armstrong reported. ``People everywhere have,
by television and photographs, shared that perspective and shared
our concern for the security of our globe.''

   ``That's one small step for a man,
one giant leap for mankind.''
   Twenty years have passed, nearly a generation, since Neil
Armstrong called those momentous words down from the moon.
   Two decades since Earthlings watched those flickering television
images, saw that tentative first step on the dusty surface and
looked on in wonder as two Americans hopped about in weak gravity,
planted and saluted their flag, picked up bits of lunar treasure and
spoke with their president a quarter million miles away.
   Most people living then can tell you today where they were when
astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took those first steps on
the moon Sunday, July 20, 1969.
   They were realizing a goal that John F. Kennedy had set in
frustration and desperation.
   Kennedy came to office in January 1961 with a pledge to ``get
this country moving again.'' The economy was sluggish, Fidel Castro
had taken over Cuba, and the United States trailed the Soviets in
the highly visible arena of space.
   The space chasm widened April 12, 1961, when Soviet cosmonaut
Yuri A. Gagarin blasted into orbit, the first man to fly in space.
   American prestige was rocked again five days later. On April 17,
a brigade of Cuban exiles, sponsored by the Central Intelligence
Agency, stormed the beach at Cuba's Bay of Pigs in an effort to
overthrow Castro. His forces routed the ill-equipped exiles, leaving
the United States and its young president in shame and disarray.
   Kennedy accepted the blame and decided bold action was needed to
restore America's honor. Space was the answer, he concluded, and he
gave Vice President Lyndon Johnson the task of determining what
could be done.
   On April 28, the National Aeronautics and Space Council, which
Johnson chaired, submitted a preliminary report to the president.
``The moon is a good target for us,'' it said.
   Even as the president and his advisers were discussing moon
trips, some in the administration were concerned about the first
U.S. man-in-space flight, now set for May 2. With everything going
wrong for the nation, the impact of a failure could be devastating.
   But Kennedy let the launch date stand, and, on May 5, after a
three-day weather delay, astronaut Alan Shepard rode a slender
Redstone rocket and a cramped Mercury capsule 115 miles up and 302
miles down the Atlantic tracking range on a 15-minute suborbital
flight.
   America heaved a sigh of relief. The Soviets were still ahead,
but the United States was on the move.
   On May 25, four months after taking office, Kennedy delivered a
special State of the Union message on urgent national needs. It
covered many subjects, from the economy to disarmament. It also
dealt with space.
   ``I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the
goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to Earth. No single space project in this
period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important to the
long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or
expensive to accomplish.''
   The project was called Apollo _ after the Greek archer-god, the
god of light and truth, bright-shining, far-shooting.
   Christopher C. Kraft Jr., who would become flight operations
director for Apollo, was a NASA engineer working on the Mercury
project.
   ``I thought he had lost his mind,'' Kraft said of Kennedy and his
bold commitment. ``We had a total of 15 minutes of manned
spaceflight experience, we hadn't flown Mercury in orbit yet, and
here's a guy telling me we're going to fly to the moon. ... Doing it
was one thing, but doing it in this decade was to me too risky.''
   Despite the doubts of Kraft and others within NASA, America's
biggest, costliest and most ambitious technological effort began
with virtually no dissent. Before it was achieved, more than 20,000
industrial contractors and 420,000 technicians, engineers and other
skilled persons would be involved.
   While the hardware of Apollo was being developed and tested,
Americans and Russians were learning to live and work in space and
to perfect the rockets, spaceships and techniques for going to the
moon.
   To a watching world, it was like a relay race in space. The
Russians, with their larger booster rockets and larger manned
spacecraft, held the early lead.
   John Glenn in 1962 was hailed as America's first orbital
champion. Three more Mercury orbital flights proved man could
survive and function for at least a short time in weightless space.
   NASA moved on in 1965 to the two-man Gemini program, and 10
exciting flights in 20 months tested and proved all the rendezvous
and docking and space walking procedures needed to travel to the
moon.
   The Russians, too, were perfecting these techniques. But by early
1967, as the United States was ready to move into manned Apollo
flights, America seemed to have a slight lead, based on superior
computer and other technologies.
   Then, tragedy.
   In a countdown test on Jan. 27, 1967, a month before the planned
launch, faulty wiring released a spark that touched off an inferno
inside the Apollo 1 cabin. The flames, intensified by the 100
percent oxygen environment, incinerated the three-man crew, Gus
Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee.
   Three months after the Apollo fire, cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov
rode into orbit in a new spacecraft named Soyuz, believed to be a
test model for a lunar command ship. After a day in orbit, as he
returned to Earth, Soyuz 1 tumbled, became tangled in its parachute
straps and crashed. Komarov became the world's first in-flight space
casualty.
   In both countries, critics brought their guns to bear on both
space programs. Each was halted for nearly two years while repairs
were made.
   Apollo was reexamined, rewired, redesigned and finally flew.
Apollo 7 orbited the Earth for 11 days in October 1968, and then, in
a bold move, NASA officials decided to fly the three-man Apollo 8
crew into orbit about the moon on Christmas Eve 1968.
   They reasoned the flight would provide vital information about
navigating to and around the moon, buy time while the lagging lunar
landing module was readied, and rob the Soviets of any glory they
might reap by looping one man once around the backside of the moon
on a translunar trajectory; there was a widely reported rumor that
the Soviets were ready to do just that.
   The mission was a huge, uplifting success, and two more flights,
one in which two astronauts swooped to within 10 miles of the lunar
surface, set the stage for the main event, Apollo 11.
   More than 1 million people _ tourists, congressmen, diplomats,
business people, reporters and movie stars _ came to watch the
launch at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969. All eyes stared
at the sheet of flame as the mighty Saturn 5 rose ponderously from
Launch Pad 39A, precisely on schedule at 9:32 a.m., and sent a
thunderclap across the scrubland.
   In the spaceship on the tip of the rocket were Neil Alden
Armstrong, 38, a civilian, the commander; Air Force Col. Edwin
Eugene Aldrin Jr., 39, the lunar module pilot, and Air Force Lt.
Col. Michael Collins, 38, the command module pilot _ ambassadors
from planet Earth headed for a target 250,801 miles away.

   Several times in the final minutes
before man first touched down on the moon's surface, the astronauts
and ground controllers came close to aborting the attempt.
   ``There were some scary things during that descent,'' astronaut
Neil Armstrong recalled later. ``Especially those computer alarms.''
   After separating from Mike Collins and the mother ship, Columbia,
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, in the lunar module Eagle, swooped behind
the backside of the moon, out of radio contact with Mission Control
in Houston.
   Armstrong fired the descent engine on the farside, 70 minutes
before the planned touchdown.
   Ground controllers did not know until 39 minutes later, when
Eagle returned to radio range, whether the engine had fired
successfully to shift the astronauts into an orbital path whose low
point was just 9.8 miles above the surface.
   Once Eagle reached this closest approach, Armstrong had five
seconds to decide whether to ignite the descent engine again to drop
to the surface or to abort and initiate a rendezvous course to
Columbia.
   As the critical moment approached, Mission Control detected two
problems that could cause an abort.
   ``We were getting broken voice and telemetry communications,''
recalls Gene Kranz, the Apollo 11 flight director who today is
director of flight operations at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   ``Immediately it flashed through my mind this basic ground rule
that I had to be sure that whatever happened, we had to have data
during this critical attempt at descent and landing,'' Kranz said.
``The data was broken, but the key stuff was there. And we were able
to improve it by making a minor change in the LM's attitude.''
   At the same time, Stephen Bales, the 26-year-old guidance officer
in the control center, detected the module ``was going toward the
moon about 15 miles an hour faster than the guidance computer
thought it was because some navigation errors had been introduced
into the system.
   ``Now 15 miles an hour doesn't sound like much, but we had an
abort limit that I was supposed to call that said if this thing grew
to 23 miles an hour, I had to stop the landing. I had to say no
go,'' Bales said.
   That much excess speed would have pushed Eagle outside the
previously photographed landing zone in the Sea of Tranquillity.
   ``We did not want them trying to land in unfamiliar territory,''
said Bales, who today is chief of the systems division at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston. Fortunately, the spacecraft did not
gain additional speed.
   These problems resolved, Armstrong was given the green light to
again start the descent engine. He pressed the button. Landing on
the Sea of Tranquillity was 12 minutes away.
   Suddenly, computer alarm lights began flashing in the cabin. The
guidance computer was overtaxed, and Eagle again was rapidly
approaching an abort situation.
   ``The computer was on a fixed one-second cycle,'' Bales said.
``It had to navigate, it had to guide, it had to display data to the
crew, it had to trim the engine. And if it couldn't get all its jobs
done in one second, it gave this overload alarm.
   ``Fortunately, the guys who programmed it were very sharp and
they put the least needed tasks at the bottom of the stack and the
most needed at the top,'' he said. ``We had seen the same thing in a
simulator run just two weeks before the launch. And because I could
see the computer was solving all the right problems, I told Gene
Kranz to have the crew ignore the alarms and keep going.''
   Chris Kraft, the flight operations director who now is a private
aerospace consultant, said in a recent interview that Bales'
contribution was ``absolutely vital.''
   ``Without his ability to see into the operations of that
computer, we would have waved off, aborted,'' Kraft said.
   Another abort situation faced Armstrong and Aldrin as they neared
the surface. Because of the navigation error, they were coming in
about four miles west of their planned touchdown point. Instead of
the relatively smooth area they'd expected, Eagle was coming down in
an area strewn with boulders and pocked with craters.
   Armstrong took manual control and began flying the module like a
helicopter, searching for a smooth spot.
   ``We didn't know what was going on,'' Bales said. ``We knew he
was close to the surface but was not landing. He was running out of
gas, and I said ... we're going to have to abort for gas.''
   Armstrong had only about 12 seconds of fuel left when he dropped
Eagle onto the surface.
   ``Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed,''
Armstrong reported.
   ``Roger, Tranquillity,'' said astronaut Charlie Duke, the capsule
communicator in the control center. ``We copy you on the ground. You
got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again.''
   Everyone in the control center was cheering, applauding. Flight
director Kranz suddenly realized discipline was breaking down, that
the team had to be ready to make split-second decisions in case the
astronauts had to make a sudden takeoff from the moon.
   ``All right, everyone,'' he said. ``Get settled down. There's a
lot of work to do.''
   Within seconds, they were preparing for a possible emergency
liftoff.
   Radio data indicated pressure in a descent engine fuel line,
apparently because it was frozen.
   ``That started sounding pretty bad,'' Bales recalled. ``Gene
called down to me and said, `I don't have time to follow what you're
doing because I've got to follow this freezing problem. You just
make sure you've got all the right stuff loaded into the computer
because we may be lifting off.' That really bothered me because it
would be a shame if we had to lift off now.
   ``As we were loading the right insertion velocity, azimuth and
other things into the LM computer, the line that they were talking
about ruptured,'' Bales said. ``It caused no damage and because it
was on the no-longer-needed descent engine, everything was OK. That
was a big, big, big relief. They stayed on the moon.''

   Neil Armstrong, the first man on the
moon, withstood the pressure of fame. Buzz Aldrin, the second
moon-walker, was not so lucky.
   After they returned to Earth as heroes, along with pilot Michael
Collins who had stayed in lunar orbit, there were months of public
appearances, goodwill visits abroad and seemingly endless interviews
and autograph signing.
   The three Apollo 11 crewmen remained with NASA for awhile.
   In 1971, Armstrong retreated to the privacy he craved. He also
realized a dream to teach, becoming a professor of aerospace
engineering at the University of Cincinnati.
   After nine years at the university he became an aerospace
consultant. Today he is chairman of CTA Inc. in Lebanon, Ohio, a
computer systems company. Now 58, he and his wife, Jan, live on a
farm near Lebanon.
   Aldrin had trouble handling the post-Apollo 11 celebrations and
subsequent disappointments when he returned to active military duty
with the Air Force.
   ``My depression was brought on by being thrust into the
uncomfortable area of public relations, followed by a period of
wondering where you fit in after being an astronaut on the moon,''
Aldrin said.
   An Air Force colonel, in 1971 he was named commander of the
Aerospace Research Pilots School at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. _
``a school I didn't know anything about'' after being away from the
service 10 years. He said his previous military training had not
prepared him to be a leader.
   Eight months later, Aldrin checked into a military hospital in
San Antonio, Texas. ``I was on my way to having a good old-fashioned
American nervous breakdown. I realized it and asked for help.''
   He went through bouts with mental illness and alcoholism but
recovered from and lectured on both. During this bad period he was
divorced, remarried and divorced again. He wrote a book, ``Return to
Earth,'' about those troubled times.
   After his recovery he retired from the Air Force and became an
aerospace consultant. Today, at 59, he has remarried and is
president of his own Los Angeles-based firm, Research &amp; Engineering.
He is author of a recently published book about his Apollo 11
experience, ``Men From Earth.''
   Collins left NASA in January 1970 to become assistant secretary
of state for public affairs. A year later he joined the Smithsonian
Institution as director of the National Air and Space Museum,
overseeing the building of the museum, which opened in 1976.
   In 1980, Collins became vice president of the Vought Corporation,
and in 1985 be became president of his own company, Michael Collins
Associates in Washington, where he and wife Pat live.

   The 12 Apollo astronauts who explored
the moon brought back 842 pounds of lunar rocks and left behind $517
million worth of discarded equipment, from moon buggies to family
photographs.
   Among the items left are the bottom halves of six lunar landing
vehicles, used as launching pads, worth a total of $270 million;
five science laboratories, $125 million; three battery-powered moon
cars, $6 million; television and still camera gear, about $4
million; 12 life support backpacks, $3.6 million, and hammers,
tongs, scoops, drills and other tools, $600,000.
   The cars and other equipment would not be suitable for use on
future missions, NASA says, ``because of structural deterioration
brought on by extreme changes in temperature.''
   Also left were batteries; garbage and human waste disposal bags;
one pullcart; six scales for weighing lunar samples; 12 pairs of
lunar boots; surface maps; compasses, and conveyor belts for
hoisting samples into the Lunar Module.
   There are six American flags, a plaque and figurine commemorating
14 dead American and Russian spacemen; a falcon feather from the Air
Force Academy, the thumbprints of moonwalker Jim Irwin's family on
silver medallions, a photograph of moonwalker Charles Duke's family,
including Booster the dog, and two golf balls that Alan Shepard hit
on the moon with a makeshift golf club.

   The footprints left in the lunar dust
20 years ago by Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
should be visible for half a million years because the moon has no
atmosphere to erode them, says a California chemist.
   But the absence of an atmosphere also leaves the moon unprotected
from meteorite and cosmic ray strikes, and these eventually will
erase the footprints, reports James R. Arnold.
   Arnold, who calls himself a cosmochemist, is director of the
California Space Institute at the University of California, San
Diego.
   ``The moon is a quiet place, lacking an atmosphere, and is
therefore free of wind and rain,'' he said.
   Arnold and his colleagues have developed techniques to measure
the rate of erosion and turnover of rocks and soil on the moon by
studying radioactive isotopes in samples brought back from six
Apollo lunar landing missions.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has urged

before its August recess to avert problems with issuing paychecks
and Social Security payments.
   ``If the Congress were to recess before the debt limit is
increased _ in addition to very likely defaulting on interest
payments and other obligations _ the United States could not honor
$3 billion of military retirement and salary payments on Aug. 31 or
payments totaling over $20 billion to Social Security and
supplemental security income recipients, railroad and civil service
retirees and veterans on Sept. 1,'' Brady said in letters to Senate
leaders.
   Copies of the letters, dated Friday, were released Tuesday.
   ``Our current estimates show that the permanent debt ceiling of
$2.8 trillion will be sufficient only to early August,'' Brady said.
   Brady said the $3.1 trillion limit in the House-passed version of
the debt ceiling bill would be sufficient for the remainder of the
fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.

   Adolph Coors Co. said it will drop a
television commercial that a New York Polish-American leader says
makes fun of Polish music and heritage.
   ``We're concerned there are some consumers out there who were
offended by it,'' said Coors spokesman Joe Fuentes. ```We never
intended that. We're going to drop the commercial. We're going to
apologize for any concern that it may have caused.''
   Edward Ostrowski, a past grand marshal of New York's Pulaski Day
Parade, said he would continue to push for a boycott of Coors
products despite Fuentes' comments.
   ``They told me they were going to drop it a week ago,'' Ostrowski
said in a telephone interview from New York. ``They're still showing
it. ... I think it was a slap in the face of the Polish people.
   ``It makes fun of our national music and our heritage. It's a
disgusting variation of Polish jokes and demonstrates an amazing
lack of sensitivity not only by Coors officials, but also by the ad
agency who devised this piece of trash.''
   Fuentes said the commercial for Coors Extra Gold beer was part of
a series by the Golden-based brewer called ``Party Time Tips.''
   Set in a singles rock n' roll bar, actor Tom Arcuragi, a polka
fan, said he had a tip for patrons who have trouble reaching the bar
to get another Coors Extra Gold. He then goes to the jukebox and
plays a polka and the bar empties out.
   Arcuragi played in a polka band for six years, Fuentes said.
   ``It was not our intention to offend anyone,'' he said. ``It was
designed to take a humorous look at a slice of American life. We're
just kind of exaggerating the music preference.''
   Ostrowski said the United Polka Artists first brought the
commercial to his attention. He said he would not drop his call for
a boycott until Coors officials ``call me personally and apologize.''

<HEAD>Publishers Say Bankruptcy Case Threatens Their Livelihood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty-five book publishers nationwide
say they are being squeezed financially and half may be forced out
of business because millions of dollars worth of their books have
been tied up in a bankruptcy dispute.
   The complicated case in federal bankruptcy court here involves
the small publishing houses, a Bridgeport distributor that has
failed to repay $3 million in bank loans, the Hartford bank that
loaned the money and a New York book sales organization.
   In order to collect on the loans, the Connecticut Bank and Trust
Co. has threatened to sell all the publishers' inventory held at the
distributor's warehouse.
   The bank and distributor believe receipts generated by the sale
of the books belong to the distributor. The publishers disagree.
   ``CBT may or may not win their argument that it has some right to
the publishers' books, but knows that it can bring the publishers to
their knees in the meantime because we have to have our inventory to
survive,'' said Rollin Riggs, president of one of the affected
companies, Mustang Publishing of New Haven.
   Riggs and representatives of the other publishers, the owner of
the distributorship and a host of attorneys were at U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Bridgeport on Tuesday. They had hoped to make some progress
in settling the issue, but couldn't even agree on when to return to
court for their next pre-trial hearing.
   As it now stands, a trial might not begin until December, meaning
the books could be held until at least that time.
   The case began March 9 when Key Book Service, the Bridgeport
distributor, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act.
   Three weeks later, the publishers' sales group filed for Chapter
11 protection.
   The sales organization, Kampmann &amp; Co. of New York, had been
hired by the publishers to warehouse and ship their books, as well
as collect money for the publishers. It was Kampmann &amp; Co. that
contracted with Key Book in 1987 to distribute the books.
   As part of its reorganization plan, Kampmann &amp; Co. reached an
agreement with a new distributor in Maryland. But when it sought to
move the books from Key Book in May, CBT won a court order putting a
hold on the merchandise. The order prevents the distribution or sale
of about 850,000 volumes worth about $7 each.
   In addition, all proceeds from earlier book sales were put in an
escrow account and book stores stopped payment on their orders, the
book publishers said.
   On Tuesday, CBT offered a settlement that would have required the
publishers to be responsible for repaying about $1.7 million owed by
Key Book, the publishers said. The publishers rejected the offer.
   Tracy A. Saxe, the publishers' attorney, declined to provide
details on the settlement offer. ``Their solutions are
unsatisfactory,'' he said.
   Robert M. Dombroff, CBT's attorney, refused to comment on the
case.
   Riggs, of Mustang Books, said he has about 70,000 books at the
Bridgeport warehouse. He estimated that he has books and other
assets worth more than $200,000 at risk in the case.
   ``This is my salary and profit for six years. This is everything
I've worked for,'' Riggs said.
   Bruce Shaw, the owner of Harvard Common Press in Boston, said he
has more than 75 different titles at the warehouse worth more than
$100,000. He said the books represent about half his assets.
   Unlike Riggs, Shaw said he could continue to publish if the bank
seizes all the books. ``But I will lose everything I have earned in
the past 10 years,'' he said.
   Eric M. Kampmann, president of the sales group, said about half
the 65 publishers would be put out of business if the books are
seized and sold at discount by the bank.
   Harold Levine, owner of Key Book for 40 years, said Tuesday that
he didn't want to harm the publishers and that it was CBT's decision
to obtain a court order blocking distribution of the books.
   Levine also said it was the publishers' fault that their books
were put on hold. He said that if the publishers hadn't attempted to
move the books, CBT wouldn't have acted.
   ``The independent publishers brought this to a head,'' he said.
``It didn't come out of left field. We didn't pick on those guys
because they're small and we want to beat on them.''

   Anheuser-Busch Inc. will add millions of dollars
annually to its advertising programs aimed at promoting responsible
drinking, the chairman and president of the brewery's parent company
announced.
   August A. Busch III of Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. told of the plan
at the annual meeting Tuesday of the Beer Institute in Washington.
The programs and projects, Busch said, will be coordinated and
administered by the parent company's new Department of Consumer
Awareness and Education.
   ``Whether it be through public education programs, through server
training efforts, through supporting scientific research or through
advocating the strict enforcement of the law, we can leave no doubt
where we stand,'' Busch said.
   Four years ago, Anheuser-Busch introduced the beer industry's
first prime time, paid advertising program to encourage responsible
drinking through its ``Know When to Say When'' commercials.
   Its programs since then have included TIPS, aimed at teaching
those serving alcohol to identify and prevent potential drinking
abuse, and an ``I'm Driving'' project involving designated drivers.
The company is also the major corporate sponsor of Students Against
Driving Drunk (SADD).
   A companion to the advertising, Busch said, will be a ``Good Part
of the Good Life'' campaign portraying beer's role in history, its
place in family life and its contributions to the economy.

<HEAD>Administration Panel Debates Fate Of Steel Trade Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bush administration economic panel has
debated whether to extend steel import barriers as signs pointed to
a compromise decision aimed at mollifying opponents of the
restraints.
   The five-year curbs expire Sept. 30.
   White House officials said that the cabinet-level Economic Policy
Council met privately Tuesday to discuss the controversial trade
program. Among those on the council are Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher, who would oversee the steel trade program, and U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, whose office would negotiate the
restraints with other nations.
   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said it was a ``guessing game'' whether a decision by Bush would be
released before the end of the week. The officials said Bush was
anxious to keep a campaign pledge to renew the curbs, but that he
hoped to appease manufacturers and lawmakers who believe the program
has caused steel shortages.
   ``His (Bush's) tendency seems to be to compromise,'' William
Reinsch, a steel trade expert and aide to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa,
said Tuesday. Heinz, co-chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, has
been pushing for an extension of the import barriers in their
current form.
   The American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry group, said in
a news release that the administration ``is expected to announce its
decision this week.''
   Pressured by Congress, the Reagan administration negotiated
five-year, product-by-product ``voluntary restraint agreements'' in
1984 with 29 nations, including Japan, South Korea, Brazil and the
European Community to limit the flow of steel into the United States.
   Three days before last November's election, Bush pledged to renew
the restraints in some form. But with the steel industry newly
profitable, opponents of the curbs _ led by a coalition of
steel-using U.S. manufacturers concerned about high steel prices _
say they can make a case for ending the program, or at least
narrowing its scope.
   If the program is continued, opponents are hoping it will be for
less than five years, and will allow new exemptions for
manufacturers who claim the program has left them with inadequate
steel supplies.
   ``I suppose I could live with a compromise,'' Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., a leading opponent of the restraint program, said last week.
   Bush's decision will cap months of lobbying that has included a
steel industry consultant gathering information on a rival group and
planting questions with pro-import quota lawmakers for use during
congressional hearings, according to an American Iron and Steel
Institute memorandum obtained by The Associated Press.
   The May 25 memorandum described the work of the public relations
firm Oglivy &amp; Mather, which has been lobbying on behalf of extending
the import restraints.
   The memorandum said the firm ``planted'' questions for House and
Senate committee members to ask administration trade officials, and
``gathered information on our opponents,'' namely a coalition of
U.S. manufacturers opposed to continuing the curbs.
   Reinsch, Heinz's aide, said he saw nothing wrong with the firm
offering questions to members. ``We take questions from all
sources,'' he said. ``We won't always use them, but it's the
quickest, simplest way to get the lobbyists' perspective.''
   The firm said it gathered information on the manufacturers group
simply to find out who its members were and how much steel the group
purchased.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar drifted higher in quiet European
trading today, supported by a weak yen but lacking a clear sense of
direction.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar had seemed to gain
momentum on the widening political crisis of Japanese Prime Minister
Sousuke Uno and the weakness of the yen.
   They said the currency may have lost some steam after unconfirmed
reports of intervention by the Bank of Japan early today. Statements
by the Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita indicating the Group of
Seven industrialized countries wanted a lower dollar also slowed the
U.S. unit, they said.
   ``The market hasn't really sorted its ideas out yet,'' one trader
said. ``The dollar is really drifting without turning into a clear
direction.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 143.55, up from Tuesday's closing 141.23 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 143.10 yen.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.5585 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5640 late Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.9677 West German marks, up from 1.9550; 1.6930
Swiss francs, up from 1.6845; 6.6755 French francs, up from 6.6335;
2.2034 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2010; 1,422.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,408.50; and 1.1950 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19395.
   Gold opened in London at $373.90 a troy ounce, lower than
Tuesday's closing of $376.75. At midmorning, the city's bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $373.75.
   In Zurich, gold was trading at $373.50 a troy ounce, lower than
late Tuesday's $375.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.02 to close at $374.09.
   Silver bullion was selling on the London market at $5.30 a troy
ounce, down from late Tuesday's $5.33.

yen and 143.75 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 223.61
points, or 0.67 percent, closing at 33,245.60. The market's main
barometer lost 156.61 points Tuesday.
   ``During the morning, there was strong yen selling because of the
Uno scandal. The selling really took hold in the afternoon,'' said a
dealer at Daiwa Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Rumors spread through the market this morning that new Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno might resign following allegations he had paid
three women for sexual liaisons in past years. Uno denied any
intention to resign.
   Uno's ruling Liberal Democratic Party also was shaken Sunday by a
defeat in an upper house by-election in Niigata prefecture. The
recent developments have raised concern about the conservative
party's prospects in elections next month for half the seats in the
upper house.
   The Daiwa dealer said the Bank of Japan sold $500 million to $600
million during the day in efforts to check the U.S. currency's rise.
But the intervention was absorbed as the dollar was rising, so there
was little impact, he added.
   On the stock exchange, Daiwa Bank's Kenji Ishizuka said the
plunge resulted from political concerns and the yen's fall.
   ``Seventy percent (of the fall) stems from politicians' inability
to resolve their problems,'' he said.
   Ishizuka said shares such as high-speed linear-motor car related
issues that are not affected by the exchange rate and interest rates
received particular attention from investors.
   Volume traded in the first section totaled 600 million shares, up
from Monday's 500 million shares.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade following a strong
rally in the previous session fueled by talk of Soviet purchases of
U.S. grain.
   The corn market advanced this morning on follow-through buying
but wheat and soybean prices were narrowly mixed in subdued trading.
   The Agriculture Department announced after Tuesday's close that
the Soviet Union had bought 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
market prices, partially confirming market rumors.
   And exporters reported this morning that Mexico had bought nearly
140,000 metric tons of U.S. corn overnight.
   But most of the excitement about export business seemed to have
faded today and traders were again focusing on crop weather,
including the rain that continues to delay winter wheat harvesting
in the Southeast and forecasts for drier conditions in the thirsty
western Corn Belt.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1} cents higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $4.12 a bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 2} cents higher with July at $2.65 a bushel; oats were \
cent to 1 cent higher with July at $1.53} a bushel; soybeans were 1{
cents lower to 1} cents higher with July at $7.37 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .17 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August at
70.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .07 cent lower
with August at 81.20 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .47 cent
lower with July at 48.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
unchanged to .20 cent lower with July at 34.55 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday.

   Coal trucks were ambushed in Virginia
and West Virginia and striking miners clogged roads used by coal
haulers today, one day after a judge ordered an end to wildcat
strikes by 43,000 miners in nine states.
   The United Mine Workers said it would encourage the strikers to
comply with the federal judge's order, but miners have ignored
similar orders in the past.
   There were no immediate reports of strikers heeding the order.
But most began their traditional, two-week summer vacations this
week.
   Four coal trucks were peppered with gunfire this morning in West
Virginia and Virginia, and another was shot Tuesday, police said. No
injuries were reported and no arrests were made. Some shots were
fired from the hills.
   A truck was hit with steel balls fired from a slingshot this
morning, State Police said. Rocks were thrown at coal trucks
Tuesday, breaking windshields and injuring a mining superintendent
in the eye near Boomer, authorities said.
   Shots were fired at coal trucks and on picket lines Thursday and
Friday for the first time since the wildcat strikes began June 12.
No one was seriously injured.
   In Virginia, UMW members from six states continued to create
traffic jams on coal hauling roads today despite a federal judge's
threat of daily fines of $120,000.
   Hundreds of cars and trucks paraded slowly on a narrow road
linking Pittston Coal Group's main processing plant with supply
mines, said State Police spokesman Charlie Vaughan.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp ruled Tuesday the wildcat
strikes in nine states violate U.S. law against secondary strikes.
The strikes are in support of 1,900 UMW members who have been on
strike against Pittston Coal Group since April 5.
   Knapp issued the temporary injunction at the request of the
National Labor Relations Board. He said union officials must report
to the NLRB within 10 days on what steps they have taken to meet the
court order.
   Union President Richard Trumka said union officials did not
believe an injunction was warranted.
   ``These work stoppages are not sanctioned by the union and the
international has requested the affected members to return to
work,'' he said in a statement.
   ``We will take the necessary steps to comply with the court's
order as we review the next legal steps.''
   As many as 46,000 miners in Missouri, West Virginia, Alabama,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and
Virginia have been off the job. Missouri's miners went back to work
on Monday.
   Back-to-work orders have been issued in at least four states but
largely have been ignored.
   Knapp ordered the union to stop any activities that might cause
miners to continue wildcat strikes.
   In Ohio, union officials representing 850 coal miners at two
Southern Ohio Coal mines said the miners would ignore the judge's
order.
   ``These men ain't going back,'' said George Thacker, president of
UMW Local 1890 in Langsville. ``We got to take a stand sometime. It
might as well be now.''

<HEAD>Faxes Duplicating Japanese Electronics Success Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During protests in Beijing for democracy, Chinese
students in California demonstrated the growing power of the humble
fax machine by using it to bypass censorship and send information
into China.
   The machines were made, naturally, in Japan.
   Faxes, once pricey, snail-paced curiosities, have become a basic
necessity in offices around the world _ and a source of profits for
Japanese electronics companies.
   Although fax machines were invented in the West, it was Japanese
companies that perfected and popularized them in a repeat of their
success with a host of other products originally developed overseas.
   More than 20 Japanese companies now produce almost all the
world's facsimile machines, a market estimated at $3.5 billion a
year. U.S. firms that once made them have become mere middlemen,
putting their name on equipment manufactured in Japan.
   ``American companies don't seem interested in making faxes
themselves,'' said Toshikasu Hori of Matsushita Graphic
Communications, maker of Panasonic faxes. ``They're more interested
in buying Japanese-made machines to sell under their own brand
names.''
   Japan's domination of the market reportedly spared faxes from
inclusion this spring in a list of Japanese products being
considered by Washington for punitive tariffs in response to alleged
restrictive trading practices in Japan. The reason: tariffs would
hurt American consumers without benefiting any American producers.
   With the world's market open to them, Japanese fax makers are
waging a fierce battle among themselves for rapidly increasing sales.
   The battle illustrates the way Japanese companies have come to
dominate markets in the past for such products as transistor radios
and videotape recorders.
   It may look like an orchestrated push by Japan Inc. when Japanese
companies enter an overseas market with price-slashing, heavy
advertising and a flurry of product introductions. But underneath
there is cutthroat competition among Japanese firms for market share
and razor-thin initial profits.
   The competition has brought down prices and speeded the
introduction of sophisticated features into lower-priced models,
says Satoshi Aoki of Ricoh Co., which shares the market lead with
Matsushita.
   Ten years ago, fax machines made in the United States took up to
six minutes to transmit a page. Now technological advances,
particularly in semiconductor image sensors, digitization and
microprocessors _ the ``brains'' of the machines _ have reduced
transmission time to as little as three seconds and the price for
slower basic models to as low as $500.
   At those prices, a fax message often costs less than a letter,
even to another country, and much less than overnight delivery
service.
   ``We've virtually stopped sending letters, and use the fax
instead,'' says Nobue Hoshi, a secretary at a radio production
company. ``It's cheaper and much faster than a letter.''
   Hori says Japan's lead in image sensor technology so far has kept
out competition from Asia's newly industrialized economies, South
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
   ``But we've had many Korean and Taiwanese visiting Matsushita in
the past year studying our production process,'' he said.
   Analysts expect one and possibly both countries to enter the
market later this year with low-priced models, in a repeat of
patterns followed in other industries once dominated by Japan.
   That would intensify competition in the fastest-growing market
segment, moderate-priced machines for smaller businesses.
   About 22 percent of Japan's 5.7 million small businesses and
stores with less than 10 employees now have faxes, and the rate is
expected to rocket to about 60 percent in three years, Hori says.
   Japan is expected to produce 4.2 million fax machines this year,
up 23 percent from last year. Of that, about 1.2 million will be
sold in Japan, and a similar amount in both North America and
Europe, according to government forecasts.
   The fax caught on quickly in this country partly because the
complexity of the Japanese writing system makes it difficult to use
Japanese in sending a message by telex or computer.
   Already, Japanese can use coin-operated fax machines at the
neighborhood convenience store to order home-delivery noodles or
pizza, send a comment to a TV panel discussion show, request prayers
from a shrine for success in school entrance exams, or obtain a
detailed map of any part of Japan.
   In Osaka, the Sakura Taxi Co. offers fax-equipped taxis for those
who don't want to be out of touch with their offices. Coin faxes
also are available in some train stations, tour buses, boats and
Japan Airlines flights.
   Few Japanese homes are fax-equipped, Hori said. ``There are still
too few uses for a home fax,'' he said. ``Not enough other people
have them yet to make them worthwhile. It's still easier just to use
the telephone.''
   But that will change over the next five years, the Matsushita
executive said.
   New models aimed at household use include a combination fax and
answering machine that can recognize whether a human voice or
another fax is on the other end of the phone line and respond
accordingly.
   Some foreign businesses are using the Japanese product to
increase their sales in Japan, bypassing traditional distributors.
   ``I couldn't live without it,'' says Paul MacLardy, owner of
Arise Imports, a Washington, D.C.-based fashion and antique exporter.
   ``It's amazing how many small businesses have faxes in Japan. We
get a new piece of merchandise in and fax out a letter to about 20
shops. Then the next day we generally get a fax back saying whether
they want it,'' he says.
   While fax owners in the United States complain about a stream of
``junk faxes,'' or unsolicited advertising messages, Japanese
secretaries are reporting ``obscene faxes,'' often dirty drawings,
arriving on their office fax machines.

<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge plunged 1.2 percent in May, the biggest decline since the
stock market crash in late 1987, the Commerce Department reported
today.
   The decline in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators was the
third in the last four months, as the gauge designed to foretell
economic activity six to nine months into the future continued to
flash strong signals of a significant decline in economic activity.
   The 1.2 percent decline was significantly steeper than analysts
had been expecting. However, economists generally believe the
economy can escape a recession this year, although they are looking
for a major slowing in economic growth accompanied by rising
unemployment.
   The 1.2 percent drop in May followed a 0.6 percent gain posted in
April. The index had fallen 0.6 percent in March and 0.3 percent in
February.
   The May decline was the stepest since a 1.8 percent plunge in
November 1987. That drop reflected the shock to the economy from the
508-point plunge in the Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks on
Oct. 19, 1987.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater attemptged to put
the May report in a positive light, saying: ``The economy is healthy
and growing at a slower pace, which means less pressure on inflation
and interest rates. We still think that the economy is in very good
shape.''
   The April increase had allowed the index to steer clear of the
traditional signal of a forthcoming recession _ three declines in a
row. But the May report added to the overall downward trend this
year that has worried many economists.
   Today's index figure reinforced recent government and private
industry reports that show almost every sector of the economy
contracting because of the Federal Reserve Board's efforts to raise
interest rates to control inflation.
   For instance, only two of the 11 forward-looking business
statistics that make up the composite index _ higher stock prices
and increased building permits _ pointed upward in May.
   The others pointed down: a drop in the money supply; lower prices
for sensitive materials, indicating slower demand; the fourth
consecutive drop in an index measuring consumer confidence; faster
vendor deliveries, meaning declining demand; a shorter average work
week; fewer orders for plants and equipment; a decrease in
manufacturers' unfilled orders; higher initial claims for jobless
benefits; and a decrease in manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   The various changes left the index at 143.8 percent of its 1982
base of 100. So far this year, the index has declined at an annual
rate of 2.0 percent, compared with an increase of 4.5 percent for
all of 1988.
   There have been signs recently the Fed has relaxed its grip
slightly, but the effects remain. Some economists fear that, unless
the central bank eases more, the economy could be pushed into a
recession.
   ``We're still looking for a soft landing without a recession, but
we're keeping our fingers crossed,'' said David Wyss, senior
financial economist at Data Resources Inc., in Lexington, Mass.,
said Tuesday.
   Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said: ``I still think we'll avoid a recession, but
the data probably is a little weaker than any of us had expected.''
   Economist James Annable of First National Bank of Chicago sees
the economy slowing dramatically, but without sliding into a
recession.
   In advance of today's report, most economic forecasters were
predicting the index would give up its April gain _ if not more.
   But they thought the economy, now in its seventh year of
expansion, would continue to grow, although slightly, this year.
   Chimerine described 1989 as a ``transition into a long period of
fairly slow growth,'' somewhere between 1 percent and 2 percent.
   Annable said, ``We will see real economic growth for the rest of
the year of more than 2 percent.''
   Wyss, who predicts a soft economy for the remainder of the year,
is looking for ``just over a 1.2 percent growth rate during the
second half of 1989.''
   And the latest monthly survey of 51 top economists conducted by
the Blue Chip Economic Indicators Newsletter put the consensus
growth forecast this year at 2.7 percent, down significantly from
Gross National Product growth of 3.9 percent in 1988.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar strengthened against major European
currencies Wednesday, largely due to an overnight fall in the
Japanese yen. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the yen was driven down on
speculation that Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno might be forced
to resign because of a sex scandal, renewing political uncertainty.
   In April, Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, anounced his
resignation in the wake of a financial scandal involving cabinet
ministers, officials and businessmen.
   London financial markets were quiet because of a one-day rail and
subway strike that kept some dealers and investors away from their
offices.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.55 yen, up from 141.23. In
London late Wednesday the dollar traded lower at 142.65.
   One British pound cost $1.5613 dollars in London late Wednesday,
cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.5640.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday: 1.9630
West German marks, up from 1.9550; 1.6870 Swiss francs, up from
1.6845; 6.6645 French francs, up from 6.6335; 2.2125 Dutch guilders,
up from 2.2010; 1,421.50 Italian lire, up from 1,408.50; and 1.1950
Canadian dollars, up from 1.19395.
   Gold bullion prices dropped by as much as $2 an ounce as the
dollar strengthened.
   The late gold price in London was a bid at $375.25 a troy ounce,
down from $376.75 late Tuesday. The late Zurich bid price was
$373.75 an ounce, down from $375.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $373.55 an ounce, down from
$373.85.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.30 a troy ounce,
down from $5.33.

<UNK>Appeals Court Upholds Ruling For TWA</UNK>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court panel ruled Wednesday
that Trans World Airlines Inc. had not bargained in bad faith to
precipitate and prolong a strike by flight attendants in 1986.
   Members of the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants went
on strike March 17, 1986 after Carl Icahn, who had taken control of
TWA, bargained unsuccessfully for cost-saving concessions from the
union. After a federal mediator could not resolve differences, Icahn
cut flight attendants' wages by 22 percent, increased working hours
and changed rules.
   TWA hired 2,700 new flight attendants to replace strikers. About
1,300 attendants resigned from the union and continued to work. On
May 17, 1986, the union offered unconditionally to return to work
without a contract.
   The union later went to court, accusing TWA of bargaining in bad
faith and seeking reinstatement to jobs lost in the strike and back
pay at pre-strike rates.
   U.S. District Court Judge Howard Sachs granted TWA's motion to
dismiss the union's claim and his decision was upheld by a
three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In his
ruling, Sachs chastised both sides for sometimes angry and abrasive
negotiations, but said TWA's actions were legal responses to
economic conditions.
   ``I cannot conclude from the evidence presented that TWA's
bargaining was in bad faith,'' Sachs said in a 78-page ruling.
   Sachs said the law permits an aggressive union to bargain for
benefits that will increase an employer's costs, and that an
aggressive employer can lawfully bargain for reduction in total
expenses of a group thought to be considerably overpaid and much
less productive than is feasible.
   Sachs made reference to allegedly sexist remarks made by Icahn,
saying they were made when he ``was engaged in debating and
apparently became angry or lacked the sophistication to realize he
was likely to antagonize rather than convince.''
   ``There has been no persuasive showing that sex stereotyping
governed or influenced Icahn's economic demands _ only his
rationalizations,'' Sachs said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most corn and wheat futures prices closed
moderately higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in
reaction to detrimental crop-weather forecasts.
   Oat futures retreated and soybeans were mixed.
   The outlook is for hot, dry weather this weekend in the Midwest,
especially in the western section, where corn and soybean crops are
still badly in need of rain.
   The same forecasts gave some support to the soybean market but
the weather-related buying was offset by technically inspired
selling, analysts said.
   News that protesting Brazilian soybean producers may temporarily
resume sales to processors as part of a government-requsted 10-day
``cooling-off period'' prompted further selling of soybeans,
especially for near-term delivery.
   But rain is expected to continue in the southern Mississippi
Valley, where soggy field conditions have brought harvesting of soft
red winter wheat to a standstill.
   ``The wheat is not coming to market, it's not going out for
export, it's not going to mills and they are starting to have some
loss-of-quality problems,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain-market
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   At the close of trading, wheat was { cent lower to 4} cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $4.12 a bushel;
corn was 1} cents to 3{ cents higher with July at $2.64{ a bushel;
oats were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with July at $1.50{ a bushel;
soybeans were 11 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with July at $7.27{

<HEAD>General Mills Profit Cut by Loss from Discontinued Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Inc. on Wednesday reported a 35
percent drop in fourth quarter profit due to a loss from
discontinued operations.
   The maker of cereals and other packaged foods also said its
after-tax earnings in the year ended May 28 rose 46 percent.
   For the final quarter of the company's 1989 financial year,
income came to $35.6 million, or 45 cents a share, down from $54.9
million, or 65 cents a share, in the corresponding 1988 quarter.
   The profit deterioration reflected a $22.1 million loss from
discontinued operations.
   Sales came to $1.44 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $1.25
billion a year year earlier.
   Earnings for all of 1989 amounted to $414.3 million, or $5.06 a
share, compared to 1988's $283.1 million, or $3.25 a share. Sales
totaled $5.62 billion in 1989 vs. $4.98 billion in 1988.
   The 1989 earnings included a net gain of $169 million from the
divestiture of operations, including Eddie Bauer, Talbots, York's,
Vroman's, which was partially offset by a loss of $70 million
related to an accounting change.
   Chairman Bruce Atwater said the annual sales and earnings gains
reflected aggressive internal growth programs throughout the company.
   General Mills' cereals, Red Lobster seafood restaurants and The
Olive Garden Italian restaurants reported strong growth, with an 11
percent unit volume gain in cereals, excellent sales gains in
established restaurants, and the addition of 100 new restaurants, he
said.
   Restaurants led the company's operating performance with gains in
sales and operating profits of 24 percent and 23 percent,
respectively.
   Atwater said the fiscal 1990 outlook in each of the company's key
businesses is promising, with expected strong food volume gains, the
addition of 90 new restaurants planned and expected benefits from
increased operating efficiency.
   General Mills, based in Minneapolis, makes cereals including
Cheerios, Wheaties and Lucky Charms. Among its other packaged foods
are Hamburger Helper, Betty Crocker and Bisquick baking mixes.

   The stock market declined broadly today, faced
with a rise in interest rates and economic uncertainties.
   The Commerce Department reported that the index of leading
economic indicators fell 1.2 percent in May, for a drop that
exceeded most advance estimates on Wall Street.
   That provided new evidence that the pace of the economy was
slowing significantly, fulfilling the goal of the Federal Reserve.
   But the response to the news in the credit markets was
unenthusiastic. Rates on government securities actually rose as
traders cashed in some of the recent gains in bond prices.
   In addition, brokers said, the leading indicators were not warmly
welcomed by traders who have been worrying that a slowing economy
might be setting the stage for a recession and a slump in corporate
profits.

   Share prices ended mixed Wednesday on the London
Stock Exchange, after tumbling sharply from strong early gains.
   The market got off to a brisk start as enthusiasm spilled over
from Tuesday's news of a narrower-than-expected British trade
deficit in May.
   But trading volume dried up in the afternoon, as many traders and
fund managers tried to make their way home amid a strike by public
transportation workers. The stock exchange closed at 4 p.m. local
time, one hour earlier than normal, because of the strike.
   At the close of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 3.0 points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,209.4. The
index surged as much as 19.2 points in early trading but then
slumped to show a loss of 0.2 point in early afternoon.
   Of the top 100 shares, there were 49 declining issues and 44
gainers. Seven of the top stocks were unchanged on the day.
   Volume declined to 446.2 million shares from Tuesday's 498.2
million.
   Despite the day's sluggish performance, traders said many
participants remained optimistic about the market following the
British trade report and the subsequent recovery in the pound.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 2.7 points at 1,832.4
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 2.06 points
to close at 1,251.62.

   Growth in some big U.S. cities appears to have
slowed but the economies of several metropolitan areas across the
country are maintaining momentum, according to a study released
Wednesday.
   The accounting firm Grant Thornton said its index of seven
economic vital signs for two dozen U.S. metropolitan areas
registered a negative reading in this year's first quarter. It was
only the second time in 17 quarters that the growth yardstick has
pointed downward.
   The index showed the average growth rate of 24 cities declined in
the first quarter by 0.30 point from 1988's final quarter to 108.8.
The previous decline occurred in the second quarter of 1987.
   Nineteen cities posted declines in their individual indices based
on statistics collected for their areas.
   The other five posted various increases. The economies of San
Diego, Houston and Miami showed the most improvement while Los
Angeles and Detroit displayed more moderate strength.
   Gains in retail sales and employment helped power economic growth
in San Diego, Houston and Miami. By comparison, retail sales
declined on average for all the cities studied while employment
increased.
   San Diego's gains in retail sales and employment were the highest
of all the cities.
   Houston's economy improved for the fifth straight quarter,
according to Grant Thornton, which said the achievement has been
surpassed only by San Diego. In the 12 months ended March 31,
Houston's economic growth was greater than that of all the cities
studied except San Diego, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Detroit.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Baltimore's index value dropped
the most of the 19 cities that posted declines in the first quarter.
Baltimore was followed by St. Louis, Seattle, Chicago and Cincinnati.
   The economic indicators used to rank the cities include factory
hours, nonfarm employment, construction permits, retail sales,
business starts and failures, and money supply.
   Grant Thornton, founded in 1924, provides accounting, audit, tax
and management consulting services in more than 50 countries.

   The dollar ended higher Wednesday against key
foreign currencies in thin, lifeless trading despite reports of
central-bank intervention.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
troy ounce of gold at $374.40 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 85 cents from
Tuesday's late bid.
   Currency dealers said the dollar got a lift mainly at the expense
of the Japanese yen, following increased speculation that Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno of Japan might be forced to resign because of a
sex scandal.
   Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, anounced his resignation
just two months ago in the wake of a financial scandal involving
cabinet ministers, officials and businessmen.
   Dealers said reports of dollar selling by the Bank of Japan and
the Federal Reserve kept the currency in a fairly narrow trading
range. The dollar also was depressed by a government report showing
the Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined 1.2 percent last
month, pointing to slower-than-expected economic growth, they said.
   Trading was described as very quiet prior to the Independence Day
holiday and since many dealers were reluctant to do much buying or
selling at the end of the quarter.
   London financial markets also were quiet because of a one-day
rail and subway strike that kept some dealers and investors away
from their offices.
   One British pound cost $1.5613 in London late Wednesday, cheaper
for buyers than late Tuesday's $1.5640. Sterling fetched $1.5580
later in New York, down from $1.5660 Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 143.55 yen, up from 141.23 yen. It traded lower
in London at 142.65 yen, and at 143.25 yen in New York, up from
141.75 yen late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.9620 West German marks, up from 1.9560; 1.6885 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6850; 1.1964 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1937;
6.6605 French francs, up from 6.6395; and 1,416.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,414.87.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.9630 West German marks, up from 1.9550; 1.6870 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6845; 6.6645 French francs, up from 6.6335; 2.2125
Dutch guilders, up from 2.2010; 1.1950 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1939; and 1,421.50 Italian lire, up from 1,408.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $376.50 a troy ounce, down 10 cents from
Tuesday's late bid.
   Gold fell in London to $375.25 an ounce from $376.75 late
Tuesday. The late Zurich, Switzerland, bid price was $373.75 an
ounce, down from $375.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $373.55 an ounce, down from
$373.85.
   Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.282 a troy ounce, down from $5.306.
Silver closed in London at $5.30 an ounce, down from $5.33.

   The stock market, wavering through an up-and-down
week, declined broadly Wednesday in the face of rising interest
rates and economic uncertainties.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had been down
20.49 Monday and up 14.99 Tuesday, dropped 21.63 to 2,504.74.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
485 up, 997 down and 488 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 158.47 million

Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the

   Talk has also increased lately that earnings at many

   Energy futures prices tumbled in moderate trading
Wednesday as investors took profits from what analysts said was an
overpriced market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 45
cents to finish at $20.03 cents per barrel. The August contract had
risen 77 cents over the previous two sessions.
   Contracts for later delivery of West Texas Intermediate posted
smaller decreases.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the July
contract for unleaded gasoline plunged 2.53 cents to 61.15 cents a
gallon. Heating oil for July skidded 1.22 cents to 49.31 cents a
gallon. Product prices for delivery after July also eased.
   Analysts attributed Wednesday's declines to a temporary
correction after recent steep gains.
   ``People...have been skeptical of the recent rise so they sold it
out today taking profits,'' said John Hill, energy broker with
Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Paving the way for Wednesday's declines was an industry report
showing crude oil supplies rose last week, some traders said.
   The American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil supplies
rose 2.2 million barrels from the previous week to 342.4 million
barrels. Heating oil stocks also rose by more than 1 million barrels
to 98.8 million.
   Although the API report showed a 1.3 million-barrel decline in
gasoline stocks to 219.3 million, analysts said prices were
continuing a correction from May's sharp rise following the Alaska
oil spill and reports of tight supplies due to new octane
requirements.
   Crude oil prices for August had risen $1.17 a barrel since last
Wednesday, the day after the July contract expired, surprising many
analysts. Several factors contributed to the rise, including a
report that Kuwait was lowering its oil production closer to the
level desired by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Kuwait previously had rejected its OPEC-imposed production
ceiling and set its own quota.
   Also driving prices higher this week were reports that put OPEC
output last month at below 20 million barrels a day, down from
previous estimates in excess of 20.5 million barrels. OPEC's
self-imposed quota is 19.5 million.

   The House voted Wednesday to begin construction
on a giant super collider particle accelerator rivaling the
Washington Beltway in size over objections that the nation can't
afford the $5 billion ``supertoy'' President Bush wants for his home
state.
   On a 330-93 vote, the House rejected an amendment by three
northern members that would have struck $110 million from an
appropriations bill to break ground on the 53-mile-long tunnel 25
miles south of Dallas.
   The amendment to delay construction of the collider was offered
to an $18.5 billion energy and water appropriations bill for fiscal
1990 that also includes $636 million _ quadruple this year's
spending _ for environmental cleanups at the nation's nuclear
weapons plants.
   The bill also finances the beginning of construction on 40 new
water projects, 37 by the Army Corps of Engineers and three by the
Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation, but limits total water
project spending to $4.15 billion, slightly less than what is being
spent this year.
   Passed later on a voice vote, the bill is the first spending
measure to be passed by either House since Bush assumed the
presidency.
   The administration opposed the new water project construction
starts, complaining they will require nearly $1 billion in federal
funds over the next several years and claiming that many of them
``are not economic.''
   White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman also complained
that bill erodes water project cost-sharing requirements adopted by
Congress in 1986. But the White House refrained from making any veto
threats over it.
   On the super collider, the administration lobbied heavily
Wednesday against the amendment by Reps. David Obey, D-Wis.; Dennis
Eckart, D-Ohio, and Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., to delay construction.
   The machine is called the superconducting super collider or SSC
because its electromagnets will be cooled to near absolute zero
temperature, where energy-wasting resistance to electrical current
vanishes.
   ``The SSC is a critical part of this administration's initiative
to strengthen the position of the nation as a world leader in
science and technology,'' the White House said in a policy
statement. ``It will produce discoveries, innovations and spinoffs
that could touch profoundly on every American.''
   Bush had sought $250 million in initial construction and other
money for the project, which the Energy Department decided before
last year's presidential election to build in Texas following an
intense competition for it by more than half of the nation's 50
states.
   Earlier this month, the president pleaded with key House members
to protect the project from cuts in science, energy and water
programs being made as part of a deficit-reduction agreement.
   Nonetheless, the House Appropriations Committee's energy and
water development subcommittee trimmed Bush's super collider request
to $200 million, including $110 million for beginning construction.
   ``We feel this will be adequate to get the project under way,''
Rep. Tom Bevil, D-Ala., the subcommittee's chairman, said Wednesday.
``As time goes on, this would become more expensive.''
   The Energy Department has estimated the cost at $5.8 billion,
expressed as the sum of the annual expenditures needed, or the
equivalent of $4.4 billion set aside in an interest-bearing account
in 1988 to pay for everything. The Congressional Budget Office has
estimated it will cost at least $6.4 billion by the time it is
completed in 1999.
   Opponents, led by Obey and Eckart, expressed fears that once
construction is under way, the project will absorb $800 million to
$900 million of the $1.1 billion that the government spends annually
on all general, non-defense scientific research. Eckart said he
believed the cost could reach $12 billion.
   ``We're beginning to leverage this project into the budget at a
cost to other science programs,'' Obey complained. ``But the
president indicates he's opposed to additional revenues. If we're
going to have these expensive toys, we ought to pay for them.''
   When completed, the super collider would be the most powerful and
most advanced accelerator in the world for studying subatomic
particles in the quest for: ``what is matter?'' Whirling beams of
protons into each other with energies 20 times what is possible
today, scientists believe they will be able to duplicate for the
first time, in an almost infinitesimally small volume, the
conditions of the postulated ``Big Bang'' moment of creation.
   ``While it's difficult to predict now where the SSC will lead us,
we do know that past scientific and technological breakthroughs have
had enormous impact on our daily lives,'' said Rep. Martin Frost,
D-Texas. ``Major advances in medicine, agriculture, computers and
lasers have come about because of our nation's commitment to basic
scientific research.''

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Rise On Hopes For Price-Support Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices posted solid gains Wednesday on slim hopes
for an international compromise to avert a collapse of the market's
26-year-old price-support machinery.
   ``The market feels that producers and consumers are working to
pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat,'' said Arthur Stevenson,
a coffee-market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New
York.
   On other markets, gasoline futures plunged; platinum futures fell
sharply; corn and wheat futures advanced; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Green, unroasted coffee settled .35 cent to 3.2 cents higher on
New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange with the contract for
delivery in July at $1.1438 a pound.
   The rally represented a significant rebound from the 11-month-low
of $1.11 a pound reached Monday, when it appeared the International
Coffee Organization was headed for the junk heap.
   The ICO, formed in 1963, is composed of 74 major coffee producing
and consuming countries. It tries to stabilize coffee prices by
limiting sales of green coffee beans by the producers to the
consumers.
   The group's current 6-year agreement expires on Sept. 30 and
members have been unable to agree on a new pact.
   The catalyst for Monday's collapse was Colombia's stated
intention to move for the abolition of all export quotas unless the
organization's members approve one of two proposals for a new
agreement at their scheduled meeting in London on Monday. Analysts
said neither proposal appeared to have enough support to succeed.
   But on Wednesday, the eve of a scheduled meeting of the ICO's
executive board, rumors flew that Colombia was seeking to postpone
the crucial vote while seeking a compromise with Brazil, the world's
largest coffee producer. Colombia is the second-largest producer.
   The key issues in the debate include demands by consumer nations
for more shipments of mild arabica coffees, the type most in demand
in North America and Europe, and for tighter controls on discount
sales of coffee to non-ICO members.
   Some unleaded gasoline futures plunged the permitted
2-cents-a-gallon limit on the New York Mercantile Exchange following
the latest weekly American Petroleum Institute report, which showed
a 1.3 percent increase in refinery activity.
   But the API report also showed a 1.3-million barrel drop in U.S.
gasoline supplies last week, and many analysts said the market's
collapse was less a reaction to the report than a technical
correction following substantial gains in six of the previous seven
sessions.
   Crude oil and heating oil futures also ended lower.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 27 cents to 45 cents lower
with August at $20.03 a barrel; heating oil was 1.22 cents to 1.57
cents lower with July at 49.31 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
1.56 cents to 2.53 cents lower with July, which has no daily price
limit, at 61.15 cents a gallon.
   Platinum futures plummeted in a selloff sparked by early Japanese
selling in the wake of the dollar's sharp rise against the Japanese
yen. Gold and silver posted only slight losses.
   Platinum settled $10.80 to $11 lower on the New York Merc with
July at $503.60 a troy ounce. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold
settled 10 cents to 60 cents lower with August at $379.20 an ounce;
silver was 2.4 cents to 2.5 cents lower with July at $5.285 an ounce.
   Most corn and wheat futures posted moderate gains on the Chicago
Board of Trade, partly in reaction to forecasts for weather
detrimental to those crops.
   Wheat settled \ cent lower to 4} cents higher with July at $4.12\
a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3{ cents higher with July at $2.64} a
bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with July at $1.50{ a
bushel; soybeans were 10} cents lower to 1{ cents higher with July
at $7.27} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in light trading ahead of Friday's quarterly hogs-and-pigs
inventory from the Agriculture Department.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .20 cent higher with August at
70.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .18 cent lower
with August at 81.07 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to
.20 cent higher with July at 49.10 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .10 cent to 1.30 cents higher with July at 35.35 cents
a pound.

<HEAD>Clothing Company Owners Bid on Bankrupt Casino</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A last-minute $70 million bid for Elsinore's
Atlantis Casino Hotel in Atlantic City was filed Tuesday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court here by an Israeli industrialist family, topping by
$7 million a bid by New York developer Donald Trump.
   Joseph, Ralph and Avi Nakash, best known as owners of Jordache
Enterprises, a New York-based jeans and clothing manufacturer, filed
the bid with U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rosemary Gambardella. The judge
set a hearing Wednesday to consider the offer.
   The new bid comes about a week after Ms. Gambardella issued a
10-day restraining order to temporarily block Trump's $63 million
purchase agreement with hotel officials.
   Creditors hold a $6.5 million mortgage on three Atlantis parking
lots. They requested the judge's order to prevent the state Casino
Control Commission, a state-appointed conservator and Elsinor Shore
Associates, owners of the property, from transferring the property
to Trump.
   The judge had scheduled a hearing for Thursday to consider
whether to extend the restraining order.
   The Nakash brothers' bid could be attractive to state gaming
regulators, and not only because it is higher. Many casino
regulators, including the Atlantis' state-appointed conservators,
have expressed concern about allowing more of Atlantic City's casino
and hotel industry to be owned by Trump.
   Trump has said he would close the casino and convert it into a
luxury hotel.
   Trump owns two Atlantic City casinos and has a third under
construction. If he buys the Atlantis, it would give him control of
34 percent of Atlantic City's casino hotel rooms, 31 percent of
casino floor space and revenue, and 48 percent of casino meeting and
exhibition space, according to state statistics.
   New Jersey gaming regulators have approved Trump's bid, and his
lawyer has said the closing on the sale is set for July 7, pending
the outcome of court action.
   In April, the Atlantis became the first New Jersey casino to fail
to win approval of its regular license renewal since legal casino
gambling began in Atlantic City in 1978. The state ordered the
casino to shut last month, ruling that the gaming hall's financial
situation was too marginal to allow it to continue operations.
   Nakash, who lives in Manhattan, said he and his brothers own
several hotels, including the Guest Quarters in Houston and two
hotels in Israel. The family also owns an American shipping line
that operates tankers and bulk carriers under the Liberian and
Panamanian flags.

<HEAD>Ad Exec Charges In $7.5 Million Suit That He Was Fired For Stuttering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advertising executive, known as one of the
industry's authorities on print media, charged in a $7.5 million
lawsuit Wednesday that a Manhattan ad agency fired him because he
stutters.
   David C. Lehmkuhl, 42, was fired in March from his
$125,000-a-year position at Ammirati &amp; Puris Inc. after four months
on the job, according to the suit, which was filed in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan.
   During an afternoon meeting in his office, Edward Vick, the
firm's president, told Lehmkuhl he was being fired because, ``We
can't have you getting any closer to the clients,'' the suit said.
   Lehmkuhl is seeking $5 million in compensatory damages from
Ammirati &amp; Puris and $2.5 million in punitive damages.
   The plaintiff's attorney, Barry R. Fischer, said, ``I think this
will be a test case in the sense that this is a fairly high-ranking,
high executive in an industry, a well-known person and
well-compensated person who has been discriminated against in an
obvious way.''
   Vick said in a telephone interview that Lehmkuhl ``was fired for
not performing.'' He would not comment on Lehmkuhl's stuttering.
   ``The whole case is so far off base and so without merit, there
is almost no point in getting into a discussion of the specifics,''
he said, adding that his company intended to ``vigorously defend the
case.''
   Lehmkuhl is described in a December 1987 issue of Marketing &amp;
Media Decisions, a media trade journal, as one of the ad industry's
``most influential authorities on print media.''
   He worked for 18 years at the advertising firm N W Ayer Inc.
before being recruited by Ammirati &amp; Puris, the suit said. As senior
vice president at Ayer, he earned $90,000 plus a $10,000 bonus in
1988 and had 35 to 40 people reporting to him, the suit said.
   He was assigned to many of the agency's most prestigious
accounts, including AT&amp;T, Procter &amp; Gamble, Gillette and Ralston
Purina, it said.
   Jean Connolly, a member of Lehmkuhl's media staff at Ayer, was
quoted by Marketing &amp; Media Decisions as saying: ``He is brilliant.
He has a hard time communicating his ideas verbally, but he still
has this incredible reputation behind the scenes. Talk about unsung
heroes.''
   Fischer said in a telephone interview that his client ``tended to
have top subordinates do presentation type work. But there was no
evidence that it held him back in any way. His career speaks for
itself, that he has come a tremendous way despite his disability.''
   According to the suit, Lehmkuhl decided to leave Ayer when
Ammirati Puris offered him a $125,000-a-year position as senior vice
president and director of media services, as well free use of a BMW,
a $10,000 bonus and eligibility to participate in the executive
bonus pool beginning in 1989.
   The suit says Vick had met with Lehmkuhl more than once prior to
hiring him and was aware that he stuttered.
   During his first week on the job, Vick invited him to lunch; it
proved to be the turning point in their relationship, according to
the suit.
   ``Under the stress of the new job, Mr. Lehmkuhl's stutter was
more readily apparent,'' it said.
   ``The moment his disability manifested itself, Vick immediately
shunned Mr. Lehmkuhl and refused to offer even a modicum of
cooperation in trying to reasonably accommodate Mr. Lehmkuhl's
disability.''
   Lehmkuhl took steps to improve his speech. He signed up for
speech therapy classes and a public-speaking course, the suit said.
On March 15, he was fired.
   Fischer said his client is currently a ``self-employed consultant
in the media business,'' making a fraction of what he used to earn.

   Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Beatrix of the
Netherlands were not amused by getting stuck in London traffic
Wednesday night along with thousands of other commuters caught by a
24-hour subway and rail strike.
   Two businessmen in bowler hats tried water-skiing to work on the
Thames, but not even a police escort could get the two monarchs to a
700-year-old church on time for an ecumenical service.
   The 24-hour strike, which Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called
``absolutely disgraceful,'' idled all railroads and nearly the
entire London subway system. It was the second big transit strike in
a week and the eighth walkout in 12 weeks by London Underground
workers.
   Elizabeth and Beatrix were 15 minutes late at the Dutch Church in
London's financial district, but the service marking three centuries
since William of Orange of Holland and his English wife Mary took
the English throne did not start without them.
   The church was founded in 1253 and rebuilt after being bombed in
World War II.
   ``Police outriders tried to clear the traffic but there was
nowhere to clear it,'' a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. ``Anyone
traveling on the roads this evening would be in a similar state.''
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon said the strike was ``utterly
intolerable.'' He said the government would not get involved and
urged all parties to seek independent arbitration.
   Transit employees staged the walkout to press their demands for
higher wages. They threatened to hold another strike July 5.
   Employers reported more workers reached their offices than on
Jan. 21, when London's bus drivers and conductors joined subway and
railroad employees in the earlier walkout.
   The Confederation of British Industry estimated 75 percent of
London workers showed up at their jobs, compared with 60 percent
last week.
   ``People were lulled into a false sense of security because the
traffic was so light last week, so more people have tried to get in
this time,'' said Jane Calvert-Lee, London regional director of the
confederation.
   People have been leaving home as early as 4 a.m., she said.
   London buses were crowded but operating normally and traffic
congestion was heavy. Extra buses were running from Heathrow and
Gatwick airports into the city, and special buses took thousands of
tennis fans from central London's Victoria Station to Wimbledon in
southwest London.
   A skeleton service of 26 trains was operating on three of the
subway system's 10 lines with workers who oppose the strikes.
   Two businessmen, hoping to avoid the choked streets of London's
financial district, traveled instead on the less-congested River
Thames _ by water skis.
   But their unconventional journey from Putney, south London, came
to an inauspicious end when river police told them that water skiing
was forbidden on the Thames.
   ``When we stopped them they just sank into the water, suits and
all, their bowlers bobbing off down the river,'' said Constable Fred
Minnie, one of two officers in the police boat which stopped the
businessmen near Westminster Bridge.
   ``It was quite a sight. They said they'd had a bit of trouble
getting to work last week on the day of the strikes, so decided to
water ski today and didn't realize it wasn't allowed.''
   The River Bus Partnership, which operates river taxis on the
Thames, said it expected to carry 5,000 passengers, or five times
its normal load.
   The Royal Mail said there would be some disruptions in service
because 70 percent of the country's mail is carried by trains. It
said extra trucks were rented to help the postal service's own
34,000 vehicles.
   The National Union of Railwaymen is striking to protest the 7
percent wage hike offered its 75,000 members by British Rail.
   The 10,500 subway workers want a $99 weekly increase to operate
trains without guards. Management is offering $46 plus 14 days extra
annual vacation, but is tying the raise to increase productivity.
   About 2.7 million passengers use the London Underground daily and
2 million use rail services.

<HEAD>Dunkin' Donuts Board Denounces $43-Per-Share Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANDOLPH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of Dunkin' Donuts
sent a letter recommending shareholders not sell their shares to a
Canadian company seeking to buy the doughnut chain for $43 per
share, Dunkin' Donuts said Wednesday.
   The long-term value of Dunkin' Donuts is significantly higher
than the June 15 hostile takeover offer by DD Acquisition Corp.,
which totals $305.3 million, the board said.
   Dunkin' Donuts management has said it wants to remain
independent. Last spring it began a number of defensive steps,
including a ``poison pill'' shareholder rights plan and an employee
stock ownership plan.
   Wednesday's letter to shareholders warned of ``the highly
conditional, illusory nature of the offer'' by the two Canadian
firms behind DD Acquisition: Unicorp Canada Corp. and Cara
Operations Ltd.
   The letter also said that Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., the company's
financial adviser, had told the board the $305.3 million tender
offer was too low.
   In May, Dunkin' Donuts rejected a friendly $42-per-share, or
$298.2 million, buyout offer from Unicorp alone. On Wednesday, its
stock closed at $39.25 per share, down 62{ cents.
   In its letter, Dunkin' Donuts told shareholders it is expanding
its doughnut shop business by moving into convenience stores, 2,000
of which will sell its brand-name products by the end of the year.
The company also owns the exclusive rights to develop Chili's Grill
and Bar Resaurants in about 16 percent of North America.
   The chain said it also has slashed salaries and costs for an
expected savings of $7 million in fiscal 1990. And it said current
management has produced ``an impressive record of increased sales
and earnings.''
   Dunkin' Donuts has franchised more than 1,700 doughnut shops
worldwide and reported a profit of $13.5 million on sales of $112.8
million last year.

   A group of House Republicans introduced
legislation Wednesday to delay implementation of major provisions of
Medicare's new catastrophic illness protections, including a
controversial income tax surcharge.
   Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., who instigated the legislation,
acknowledged an uphill fight in getting the measure considered by
the full House. However, the Ways and Means Committee must send the
measure to the floor if a majority of House members _ 218 _ sign a
petition demanding such action.
   The Fawell bill, which has 25 sponsors, is identical to a measure
by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that failed to pass the Senate by one
vote.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a little under 40
percent of the 33 million Americans eligible for Medicare have
enough income to subject them to the surtax, and that only 5.6
percent are financially well off to be liable for the maximum tax.
   For about 60 percent of those eligible for Medicare, the only
additional charge for the expanded catastrophic protection is $4 a
month.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, has
scheduled hearings to consider reducing the surtax, which could be
as much as $800 this year for upper-income people over 65.
   The hearings also will consider whether to make participation in
the catastrophic illness program, and thus payment of the surtax,
voluntary rather than mandatory.
   House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., opposes
any changes in the new program, which took effect Jan. 1. President
Bush also opposes any changes.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday that Bush
doesn't want the surtax rolled back, despite estimates that it may
collect $4 billion more than needed.
   ``The program is just starting,'' Fitzwater said. ``We don't know
whether that excess will hold up or not. ... The first year is
probably not the time to tamper with a program of this magnitude
when you don't really have real-world experience.''
   Proponents argue that much of the criticism stems from the fact
that the surtax is being collected in advance to build up a trust
fund from which benefits are to be paid.

<HEAD>Court Reverses $800 Million Award in Antitrust Case Against Railroad
Co.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Wednesday reversed a
lower court ruling that had granted more than $800 million to the
state of South Dakota in a federal antitrust claim against Kansas
City Southern Industries Inc.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said South Dakota had no
standing to assert the federal antitrust action.
   About $600 million of the $844.2 million represented a trebled
jury verdict of $200 million on the antitrust claim. The rest was an
award to South Dakota on claims that Kansas City Southern and its
chief subsidiary, the Kansas City Southern Railway Co., interfered
with a contractual relationship.
   A U.S. District Court jury made the award in Sioux Falls, S.D.,
in April 1988. The jury agreed with the state's claim that the
Kansas City Southern railway had conspired with other railroads to
block a coal slurry pipeline proposed by Energy Transportation
Systems Inc. The railroad company, based in Kansas City, appealed
the award.
   ETSI was created during the early 1970s by a number of
corporations to build a slurry pipeline through which coal could be
transported from mining sites in north-central states to utility
companies in south-central states. The project was begun in response
to the energy crisis at the time.
   Coal slurry is a mixture of roughly half coal and half water.
Consequently, large quantities of water were required to operate the
pipeline.
   South Dakota's contract with ETSI to supply the pipeline with
water would have brought the state $9 million a year in revenue.
   The state's lawsuit claimed that Kansas City Southern and others
violated federal antitrust laws in delaying the 1,400-mile, $3.8
billion pipeline, which would have crossed railroad tracks.
Attorneys for the state produced a document that said Kansas City
Southern was designated to be the lead railroad to fight the project
and the water sale.
   The railroad argued that it opposed the pipeline but that there
was no conspiracy. The company also contended the project was
financially doomed with or without South Dakota water contracts.
   In its opinion, the appeals court said: ``The judgment of the
District Court should be vacated on the grounds that 1. the state of
South Dakota had no standing to bring the antitrust claim and 2. the
evidence fails to show that KCS improperly interfered with the South
Dakota ... district contract through the petitioning activities
occurring after December 1981.''
   Kansas City Southern, in a statement, hailed the decision.
   ``This removes a cloud that has hung over the company and its
business operations since the return of the jury verdict in April
1988,'' said Landon H. Rowland, president and chief executive
officer.
   South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson said he would have to read the
ruling before deciding which of three options the state will pursue.
The state could do nothing, ask the full court of appeals to review
the panel's ruling or apply directly for a hearing before the U.S.
Supreme Court, he said.
   Mickelson said he was extremely disappointed with the ruling. He
said South Dakota intended to use the money from the ETSI water sale
to support water development projects.
   ``We pursued the ETSI damages in an attempt to right a wrong done
to South Dakotans in our development of one of our most valuable
resources, water,'' the governor said in a statement.

   The captain of a Greek tanker that
spilled 420,000 gallons of heating oil into Narragansett Bay was
arrested and charged Wednesday with violating the federal Clean
Water Act and Refuse Act.
   The captain, Iakovas Georgudis, 43, surrendered and was charged
promptly in federal court in Providence to ensure that he would
remain in this country, said U.S. Attorney Lincoln Almond.
   Each of the two misdemeanor counts carries up to a year in prison
and $100,000 fine or double the actual damages, which the Coast
Guard has estimated at $1.6 million.
   The Clean Water Act prohibits the negligent discharge of
pollutants; the Refuse Act prohibits unlawfully discharging refuse
into navigable water without a permit.
   In a hearing on a second spill on the Delaware River, the pilot
and captain of an Uruguayan tanker testified that the ship's anchor
was dropped too soon, causing the vessel to run aground and leak
more than 310,000 gallons of oil.
   Painstaking cleanup continued on that spill, while workers using
hand-held skimmers were close to finishing the cleanup of 250,000
gallons of crude spilled when a third tanker collided with a barge
in Texas, soiling a mile-long stretch of Galveston Bay shoreline.
   All three spills occurred within hours of each other over the
weekend.
   In Rhode Island, U.S. Magistrate Jacob Hagopian set bail for
Georgudis at $50,000 and ordered the captain to surrender his
passport and remain on the ship until bail is paid.
   Georgudis also was subpoenaed to appear at a statewide grand jury
Wednesday that is investigating possible violations of state
pollution laws and a statute that requires ships within Narragansett
Bay to have harbor pilots on board, but he did not testify, said
State Attorney General James O'Neil.
   ``His attorney indicated he was going to exercise his privilege''
against self-incrimination, O'Neil said. Georgudis declined to
answer questions as he ran into the courthouse followed by his
attorney, Peter DiBiase.
   In interviews with Coast Guard officials and Rhode Island Gov.
Edward D. DiPrete after the spill, Georgudis admitted he made a
mistake in not taking on a pilot to escort the vessel into the
harbor.
   DiPrete said after meeting with President Bush in Washington late
Tuesday that Bush pledged the federal government would pay all state
cleanup expenses. Officials reported earlier this week, however,
that most of the oil has evaporated.
   The governor said Wednesday most shellfish beds closed in upper
Narragansett Bay after the accident would reopen Thursday. Federal
Food and Drug Administration tests showed no contamination, he said.
   The reopening comes just before the July Fourth weekend,
traditionally the most profitable time of year for shellfishermen.
Further tests would be needed before the southernmost beds could be
reopened, DiPrete said.
   At the Philadelphia hearing into the Delaware River spill, pilot
Robert Anderson said the transit of the 749-foot-long Presidente
Rivera was normal and he started slowing down more than 10 miles
below his destination, the Sun Marketing and Refining Co. refinery
in Marcus Hook, Pa. He said he told the captain to prepare for
anchoring.
   ``As we approached the intersection of Marcus Hook, I suddenly
saw sparks fly, and I said, `Jesus Christ, he didn't drop the
anchor?' I saw that's what had happened,'' Anderson said at the
Coast Guard inquiry.
   ``I was waiting for the jerk (of the anchor) that would yank the
ship. They finally got it stopped and I felt we had hit something on
the bottom. We went through various maneuvers and got the help of
two tugboats. We were able to get off and heave the anchor up.
   ``All of a sudden the ship hit bottom again, and I heard it, and
I knew we were hard and fast. One tugboat captain said he could see
oil coming out. At that point I said to the captain that we had to
notify the Coast Guard,'' he said.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Capt. Raul DiBarrart said he
told a lieutenant to prepare to drop the port anchor about 1:30 a.m.
Saturday, but before he knew it, the anchor had begun to fall.
   Lt. Ricardo Schunk, the second officer on the tanker, said the
ship's windlass, a huge winch used to raise and lower the anchor,
was not engaged as it usually is when dropping anchor. The botswain
responsible for the windlass was not present, he said.
   The hearing was recessed until next Wednesday.
   Hundreds of people have been working since the weekend to clean
up the spilled oil, which took the shape of greasy, sticky blobs,
some as large as beach balls.
   A Coast Guard spokesman said Wednesday that cleanup crews were
making headway sweeping the Delaware River. Cooler weather kept oil
blobs from melting into puddles that would soak into shorelines, but
wind shifts began to move oil to New Jersey riverbanks for the first
time.
   In Texas, only about 40 of the 6,000 barrels of oil that leaked
from the barge in the Houston Ship Channel remained on the water
Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman William Nash said.
   ``It's a slower process now because the larger machines can't be
utilized with the smaller levels (of oil),'' Nash said. ``It's more
of a hands-on operation now.''
   Testimony continued Wednesday in a hearing being held to
determine what caused the spill, which occurred Friday evening when
the Panamanian tanker turned into the barge near the intersection of
the Houston Ship Channel and the Bayport Ship Channel.

<TEXT>
   American investor T. Boone Pickens prepared Thursday
to assert his rights as the largest shareholder in Koito
Manufacturing Co. at the Japanese auto lighting manufacturer's
annual shareholders meeting.
   The stockholders meeting began at 10 a.m. with Pickens in
attendance. On several occasions, hecklers disrupted Koito President
Takao Matsuura's opening remarks and his presentation of the
company's annual report.
   In a controversial deal that is challenging the insularity of the
Japanese corporate world, Pickens announced in March that he had
bought 20.2 percent of Koito's stock, making him the company's
largest shareholder, which has close ties to Toyota Motor Corp.
   Koito has refused Pickens' request for a seat on its board of
directors, saying it doubts his assertions that he is long-term
investor with a genuine interest in helping manage the company.
   Pickens planned to present his case at the meeting, held in Tokyo.
   Meanwhile, Matsuura said Wednesday he was worried gangsters might
disrupt the gathering.
   The National Police Agency said 5,358 police are being sent to
shareholders' meetings scheduled Thursday across Japan to deal with
``sokaiya,'' racketeers who regularly disrupt such meetings, trying
to extract payoffs from management to keep silent.
   Koito, like more than 1,300 other firms, is expected to receive
police protection for its meeting, where Japanese media plan heavy
coverage in case of a management showdown with Pickens.
   Pickens _ who has a reputation as a corporate raider in the
United States _ planned a showdown at the meeting at least over the
number if representatives he can bring into the gathering.
   Pickens' purchase of Koito stock sent shock waves through the
Japanese business community, whose tradition is to consult with a
firm before taking a major stake in its stock.
   The Texas oilman has argued that Japanese shareholders should
stand up for their rights, which Japanese critics agree are limited.
Japanese businessmen agree that the interests of shareholders are
often ignored in favor of those of management and employees.
   Although Pickens' arguments for shareholders' rights have gained
some support in leading newspaper editorials, Japanese _ with an eye
to his string of unsuccessful hostile takeover attempts in the
United States _ remain suspicious of his motives.
   He has strongly denied, however, that his intention is greenmail
_ the practice of buying a company's shares to force their
repurchase at a higher price to maintain the company's management
independence.
   Pickens has raised his problems with Koito as a trade issue in
Washington, saying Americans are denied the right to invest freely
in Japan while Japanese can easily purchase American companies.
   It was not known whether sokaiya actually would show up at
Koito's meeting Thursday, but ``it's a big worry,'' said company
president Takao Matsuura in a meeting with reporters Wednesday.
   Japanese companies regularly pay off sokaiya so they won't
disrupt shareholders' meetings, and sometimes hire them to silence
complaints from other shareholders. Although the practice has been
illegal since 1982, securities industry sources say it is still
common, and over the past several years a number of executives of
major companies have been arrested for paying sokaiya.
   Koito officials say they have no ties with sokaiya. Koito is
known as a company that has avoided contact with sokaiya, said a
former securities house executive in charge of dealing with the
racketeers. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Sources close to Koito and securities industry sources say they
don't think Pickens himself has any ties to sokaiya, either.
   Many industry sources are unwilling to comment on the record
about sokaiya because they fear them or their associates. However,
information on sokaiya is well-organized, with newsletters on their
activities circulating among securities houses and businessmen who
have to deal with them.
   Detailed directories and histories of sokaiyas' activities
charting their ties with yakuza _ Japan's organized crime gangs _
are bought by managers to determine how much attention to pay to
pressure from a particular person claiming to be a sokaiya.
   Koito was informed that a number of people registered to attend
its meeting were on a police list of known sokaiya, said a source
close to the company who refused to be further identified.

   An agreement to abandon the beleaguered
Shoreham nuclear power plant cleared its final hurdle Wednesday when
Long Island Lighting Co. shareholders overwhelmingly approved the
deal.
   ``We must now come together and end the controversy,'' LILCO
Chairman William Catacosinos urged about 600 shareholders at the
company's annual meeting. ``It's hurt all of us too much.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, who helped negotiate the deal, called the
shareholders' action ``historic'' and said their approval ``allows
LILCO to devote itself exclusively in the future to providing safe
and reliable energy for Long Island at the lowest possible cost.''
   The shareholders also approved the terms of a settlement of a
class-action Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act suit
filed against the utility. It calls for LILCO to refund $390 million
to ratepayers as adjustments in monthly bills over a 10-year period.
   Under the agreement, LILCO will resume payment of dividends to
its shareholders, which were suspended in 1984, when the uncertainty
over Shoreham brought LILCO to the brink of bankruptcy. Preferred
stockholders' dividends will be retroactive to 1984.
   Shareholder approval of the deal to abandon Shoreham was the
final step before the settlement between LILCO and the state to
close the $5.5 billion Shoreham plant could take effect.
   LILCO is now expected to seek permission from the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission to sell Shoreham for $1 to the Long Island
Power Authority, a state agency. LIPA will then seek approval from
the NRC to dismantle the plant.
   LILCO was not guaranteed any rate increases in exchange for
agreeing to sell the plant. Cuomo predicted when the deal was
announced that any hikes would be probably less than 4.5 percent a
year. LILCO customers already pay among the highest electric rates
in the nation.
   State and local officials contend the area around the plant,
about 50 miles east of New York City on densely populated Long
Island, could not be safely evacuated in the event of an accident.
   It would be the the first time a completed nuclear power plant
will be closed without ever going on line.
   A preliminary tally of about 85 percent of LILCO shareholders
indicated that shareholders voted approximately 82 million to 3
million to accept the deal, according to LILCO spokesman James Lois.
   However, the deal could lead to a new round of battles since
federal Department of Energy officials have stated that they intend
to block the sale and transfer of Shoreham for dismantling. They
contend the reactor should be mothballed so that it could be
activated if necessary to meet energy needs in the future.
   It was the second time within a year that LILCO shareholders
voted approval to the state-LILCO settlement to abandon the Shoreham
facility.
   The earlier deal stalled in December when the state Legislature
refused to consider a portion of the agreement that required its
approval. The portion gave authority to the State Power Authority to
build power plants on Long Island in place of Shoreham to meet peak
electricity demands.
   The legislators charged that the rates provided for in the
agreement put a burden unfairly on LILCO customers.
   Under the revised 1989 settlement, reached in February,
legislative approval is not required.
   In April, the NRC granted a full operating license for Shoreham
after nearly a decade-long struggle to obtain the permit. Shoreham
had only been licensed to operate at up to five percent of full
power.
   Suffolk County filed suit against LILCO in 1986 under the RICO
statute charging that LILCO had lied to the state Public Service
Commission about costs and progress of Shoreham in order to obtain
electric rate increases.
   A federal jury in Brooklyn convicted LILCO, making the company
liable for billions of dollars. An attorney for the ratepayers
settled the case for $390 million.

   Knoll International Holdings Inc. said Wednesday
it intends to sell Color Tile Inc., a major retailer of floor
coverings with 700 stores nationwide.
   Knoll, a private holding company that owns an office-furniture
manufacturer and New York's ``21'' Club, said the divestiture of
Color Tile will allow it to focus on other business opportunities.
It did not say how much it would seek for the company.
   Color Tile was established in 1953 and grew into a national chain
selling floor coverings and related products, such as ceramic tiles,
wood flooring, carpet and wall coverings.
   Color Tile had sales last year of $433.9 million, after
adjustment for the sale of its Canadian subsidiary, according to a
spokeswoman for Knoll.
   Knoll acquired Color Tile in 1986 for an undisclosed price.
   New York-based Knoll also owns three companies that produce
polyurethane foam for various industrial uses and a leather
manufacturer and importer based in Canada.

   Tambrands Inc. said Wednesday that its
board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 1.125
million shares of its stock, and that it was considering selling its
diagnostics and cosmetics operations.
   Tambrands, which makes Tampax tampons and other personal-care
products, said the share buyback could equal up to 5 percent of its
22.4 million total shares outstanding.
   The shares will be used to fund the company's stock option plans
and employee benefit programs and for other corporate purposes, the
company said from its headquarters here.
   The company said it would purchase the shares on the open market
and possibly in negotiated transactions.
   Tambrands also said that ``under the right circumstances'' it
would consider selling its Hygeia Sciences unit, which makes home
pregnancy tests under the brand name First Response, and its
Physicians Formula hypoallergenic cosmetics division.
   Proceeds from these sales would be used to invest in the
company's worldwide feminine protection business or for
acquisitions, Tambrands said.

<HEAD>Electrolux Bid to Purchase Regina Approved By Judge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Wednesday
approved the Electrolux Corp.'s $70 million bid to purchase one of
its ailing competitors, the Regina Co. Inc.
   After a daylong hearing, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William Tuohey
agreed to allow the sale of all of the Rahway-based vacuum maker's
assets to CRC Acquisitions, a subsidiary of Marietta, Ga.-based
Electrolux.
   ``It was a day for the court to consider any higher or better
offers, and essentially there were none,'' said Howard S. Greenberg,
an attorney for Regina.
   The decision clears the way for sale of all Regina assets to
Electrolux, including inventory, the company name, land, trademarks
and production plants in Rahway and Long Beach, Miss.
   Electrolux, a privately-held company, lists its annual sales at
about $400 million in 1988. Regina's last fiscal year yielded about
$160 million in sales.
   Attorneys for both companies said a final closing has been
scheduled for Friday.
   Regina, a public corporation, filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code on April 26. The company's
hopes to survive as an independent competitor were all but dashed
May 4, when Tuohey turned down a $5 million refinancing package
worked out between the company and its two largest creditors, Chase
Manhattan Bank and Philadelphia National Bank.
   The package was contingent upon the banks' ability to combine a
new loan with the company's existing debt, amounting to about $25
million.
   Tuohey turned the plan down, voicing concern for the roughly $36
million in unsecured debt owed to other creditors.

   Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, agreed
Wednesday to take over 20 failed banks of MCorp, a Dallas holding
company, in what analysts believe will be the third largest
commercial bank escue in the nation's history.
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced that Banc One will be
the new owner of the MCorp banks but refused to discuss details of
the transaction before a news conference on Thursday. However,
private analysts believe the deal will involve a federal infusion of
about $2 billion.
   If the analysts are correct, MCorp will become the third biggest
bank failure, ranking behind Continental Illinois of Chicago in 1984
and First RepublicBank of Dallas in 1988, which required initial
government pledges of $4.5 billion and $4 billion respectively.
   The FDIC, which insures commercial bank deposits, said that Banc
One will assume management of the failed banks effective July 5 and
its chairman, John B. McCoy, will assume the chairmanship of the
MCorp banks under the name of Bank One Texas.
   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said Banc One agreed in principal to
invest $500 million in the new Texas operation. He declined to say
how much the government is injecting. The deal likely will become
final in four to six weeks, he said.
   Banc One's vice president for acquisitons, Bill Boardman, said in
Columbus it was not clear how much federal help or overall funds the
deal would require. The bank has made an estimate of the cost, which
he declined to disclose.
   The FDIC will take over problem loans and ``bring the balance
sheet to a zero position,'' he said.
   Banc One, he added, will manage Banc One Texas for 120 days,
identifying the problem loans and inflated assets, before the
purchase is completed.
   Banc One, the 25th largest banking company in the nation with
$25.3 billion in assets, has pioneered retail innovations and has
been one of the five most profitable banks every year since 1984.
   It was one of the first banks to offer automated tellers and it
has been a leader in packaging credit card debt into securities for
sale to investors. It allocates more of its earnings to research and
development than most banks.
   Unlike other large banks, it has shunned participating in
corporate buyout deals. Instead, its bread and butter has been
credit cards, auto leasing and student loans. Still, it's had some
missteps. An effort to create a computerized home banking network
fizzled.
   With the Texas acquisition, Banc One obtains an extensive branch
network with offices in Abilene, Austin, Houston, Fort Worth, Dallas
and other cities in the state.
   Since March 29, the failed MCorp banks have been government
owned, operating under the name of The Deposit Insurance Bridge
Bank, Dallas. That new entity was formed when regulators declared 20
MCorp subsidiaries insolvent, leaving five subsidiary banks still
operating under the private ownership of the original holding
company.
   Among the other prominent bidders for the failed MCorp banks were
NCNB Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C., which bought First
RepublicBank last year; Chemical Banking Corp., the nation's sixth
largest banking company; First City Bancorp of Houston, itself the
recipient of $1 billion federal bailout in 1987; and the New
York-based leveraged buyout firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
Early on, San Francisco's Wells Fargo &amp; Co. had also been interested
in the deal, but did not bid.
   In a written statement, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said
only that Banc One had been selected in ``a highly competitive
process'' from among ``attractive proposals.''
   Kohlberg Kravis said in a statement, ``We are extremely
disappointed. We've spent an enormous amount of time, resources and
effort on this matter.'' It noted that its proposal would have
maintained an independent bank in Texas.
   Buddy Kemp, chairman of NCNB Texas, the new name of First
RepublicBank, said his company was disappointed with the FDIC's
decision, but said, ``We remain committed to serving the Texas
market by expanding our franchise throughout the state.''
   Analysts have blamed MCorp's failure on the collapse of the
energy market, even though the bank had focused more on real estate
loans rather than energy loans. The collapse of oil prices earlier
in the 1980s snowballed into a real estate bust and a regional
recession in the Southwest.
   Seidman has said that MCorp is the agency's last major commercial
bank problem remaining. However, the FDIC also is reviewing bids for
National Bancorp. of Texas of San Antonio and Texas American
Bancshares Inc. of Fort Worth, with combined assets of $7 billion.
They are likely to be sold in a package requiring in the
neighborhood of $500 million in government assistance.
   Last year, the FDIC reported a post-Depression record 221 bank
failures and suffered its first loss since it was established in
1934, with reserves dropping from $18.3 billion to $14 billion.
Seidman has said he expects the fund to begin rebuilding its
reserves this year.
