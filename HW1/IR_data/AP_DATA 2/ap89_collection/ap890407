   ``There is no freedom without
Solidarity!'' was the slogan shouted at countless rallies and
marches since the East bloc's first independent trade union was
crushed by martial law in 1981.
   But now that the union has lived through seven years of
jailings, beatings and even killings to win back its right to
exist, what will Solidarity become?
   Many of the 10 million men and women who were active in the
Solidarity opposition movement of 1980-81 have emigrated or gone on
to other activities.
   Some of its leaders have fallen away from the movement in
disputes with chairman Lech Walesa.
   A new generation of workers, angry at shortages, low wages and
long waits for apartments, has come to the fore. Many don't
remember the Solidarity of 1980-81 and have only a vague notion of
what they want it to become.
   But a core of activists behind Walesa never let the flame die
during the hard cold winter of martial law. Professors, workers,
priests, farmers or aging activists whose names are little known in
the West, they tend to share an intense stubbornness typified by
another Solidarity chant: ``We will win!''
   Solidarity currently is built around of circle of these old
activists, with a sprinkling of new leaders who emerged during two
waves of strikes last year.
   Since 1987, the union has had a National Executive Committee,
chaired by Walesa that convenes whenever a major decision is to be
made. It is composed of about 20 members representing regions of
the country or various constituencies. Most regions also have
regional executive commissions, made up of representatives of
factory-level Solidarity committees.
   Besides its worker base, Solidarity has a brain trust of
advisers linked to the former opposition group, the Committee for
the Defense of Workers.
   These figures, who played a major role in the negotiations that
have led to reinstating Solidarity, include historian Bronislaw
Geremek, essayist Adam Michnik, political theoretician Jacek Kuron
and journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   The National Executive Committee essentially was picked by
Walesa from activists loyal to him. Well-known leaders from
1980-81, such as Andrzej Gwiazda of Gdansk or Stefan Jurczyk of
Szczecin, were left off the commission.
   A circle of these leaders said in December it had formed a
``working group'' critical of Walesa's leadership of the union and
his willingness to compromise with authorities. Answering their
calls for new union elections, Walesa has promised elections after
Solidarity is legalized.
   Walesa has also hinted occasionally he would like to relinquish
Solidarity's leadership once the union has been re-established. If
he were to take the step, younger leaders such as Zbigniew Bujak of
Warsaw, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk of Wroclaw or Mieczyslaw Gil of Krakow
probably would be first in line to take his place.
   At the grassroots level, the number of factory Solidarity
organizations is ``growing all the time, every day,'' said union
spokesman Wojciech Maziarski. In Warsaw alone, he said, the union
knows of factory organizations at 200 workplaces. In Kielce, a
provincial capital of 200,000 people, there are 60-70 Solidarity
committees in factories.
   No one, not even Solidarity, knows how many members it has
nationwide. Bujak at a public forum earlier this year estimated the
figure at about 1 million, and Walesa told reporters Friday that he
expected it to grow to 5 million to 7 million members.
   But ``it doesn't make sense'' to talk about current membership,
said Maziarski, because there is no list.
   Walesa has said it will be up to the people who join Solidarity
to decide how it will be organized. The Sejm, or parliament, meets
Friday to pass the law on trade unions that will enable Solidarity
to be legalized. Solidarity officials expect it to be registered in
court next week.
   The National Executive Commission is meeting Sunday. Although
the purpose of the meeting was not announced in advanced,
presumably the goal will be to draft plans for getting the
organization functioning smoothly as it drops the vestiges of its
underground existence.
   The national headquarters is expected to be situated in Gdansk
where the union was born after the August 1980 strikes.
   As part of its agreement with the government, Solidarity is to
be given office space around the country as it had before it was
banned.
   On a factory level, Solidarity will be obliged to cooperate with
the official OPZZ trade unions during negotiations with management.
But the union has made no commitment to cooperate on a regional or
national level.
   Both unions say they also expect to compete with each other.
Walesa said he would like to see even more competition, with
perhaps a third major union emerging eventually.
   With the introduction of freer elections and the prospect of
opposition representation in the Sejm and a new Senate, Solidarity
will be able to drop some of its responsibility as the main
opposition force and function solely as a trade union.
   Solidarity has said it will support independent candidates in
the election but will not be nominating candidates itself.
   Instead, Walesa inaugurated an advisory Citizens Committee last
year that draws together representatives of the mainstream
opposition. This group is to bear the brunt of organizing the
political opposition to the Communist Party in the June elections.

   Sixty-six drug smugglers and four
burglars have been hanged in Tehran and 19 other cities, state
radio reported.
   The executions Thursday bring the total number of reported
executions of drug smugglers in recent months to 379.
   The Tehran radio broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said 17 of the
smugglers were hanged in the capital.
   Several of those executed also were convicted of armed
resistance, gun smuggling, ``mischief, creating panic and
involvement in murder,'' the radio said.
   Authorities also confiscated 18,935 pounds of opium, 1,757
pounds of heroin and 16,440 pounds of morphine from the smugglers,
the radio reported.
   A draconian new law that took effect Jan. 21 carries the death
sentence for possession of even small quantities of drugs. The new
crackdown is an effort to combat rampant drug addiction in the
country.

<TEXT>
   After a winter of ice and white, of
stilled rivers and violent seas, of long sleeps in deep caves and
distant journeys to warmer shores, Alaska's wild kingdom is waking
up and coming home.
   Waiting in Prince William Sound for the 1 million migrating
ducks and geese due this month, the 10 million shorebirds passing
through, the endangered humpback, minke and fin whales swimming
north, the eagles flying south, the millions and millions of salmon
eggs hatching in the gravel of melting streams, and the black and
brown bears waking up hungry, is the largest oil spill in American
history.
   ``In portions of Prince William Sound we will have a silent
spring,'' said Jon Lyman, an Alaska Department of Fish and Game
official. Already, thousands of animals are known dead and
uncounted thousands more also have probably succumbed.
   But that is only the beginning. Biologists say spring, a time of
rebirth, will be a time of death in Prince William Sound.
   ``We have more and more animals coming in, birds moving up from
the lower 48 to nest, whales arriving right on time, harbor seals
and sea lions due to deliver their pups in late May and early
June,'' said Mark Kuwada, a state habitat biologist. ``If they get
contaminated, they may die.''
   Each spring, nature's wild kingdom stages a huge family reunion
among the 10,000 square miles of fiords, glaciers and rocky islands
that make up the magnificent spectacle that is Prince William Sound.
   Snow is starting to retreat up the mountainsides and green
shoots poke out from the matted brown stalks along the beaches. The
strengthening sun warms the towering faces of tidewater glaciers
snaking down from the Chugach Mountains, and half-moon bays echo
with the thunder of icebergs tumbling into the cobalt water.
   Many creatures that wander far off to other climes to escape the
unforgiving Alaskan winter are recommuning to birth their young,
breed and gorge on the abundance that has thrived here since the
last ice age.
   ``It's exciting to see the first varied thrush or rocky
sandpipers,'' said Nancy Lethcoe, a guide and naturalist who has
watched the arrival of 20 Prince William Sound springs from the
deck of a sailboat.
   Each April, she notes the return of phallaropes and puffins,
trumpeter swans and arctic terns. Even the resident mallards who
stick it out in January grow friskier day by day, splashing and
chasing each other across the water.
   As spring stretches daylight three-quarters of the way around
the clock, Prince William Sound teems with life.
   ``The daylight makes the plant cells bloom and that kicks
everything off,'' said Rick Steiner, a University of Alaska marine
biologist who's coordinating the fishermen's response to the oil
spill.
   ``Soon you've got plankton soup. Little bugs eat that. The bugs
wake up the little fish and spawning crabs who live on the bottom.
About that time, pink salmon fry and herring start emerging from
the gravel. Seabirds and marine mammals eat the herring and small
fish. Whales also eat plankton and small fish.''
   And on and on it goes, right up to the king of the realm, the
Alaskan brown bear.
   ``Bears are going to be eating these dead otters,'' said
Steiner. ``Of course, bears can eat a can of paint and survive, but
this is pretty toxic stuff.''
   Steiner is anxious to see if any animals will actively avoid the
spill. He's especially optimistic that whales, which have a higher
intelligence than most mammals, will swim away because the crude
oil slick will irritate their skin.
   ``But otters and seals and sea lions aren't as mobile,'' he
said. ``On the water they can barely see 50 feet ahead. They don't
know where else to go.''
   Prince William Sound, which contains about 800 cubic miles of
water, completely flushes itself about every 20 days, said Steiner.
But no one knows how much longer the oil's stain will scar nature's
face.
   ``All our efforts put together will protect a few streams and a
few bays,'' he said. ``In the end, the sound will cleanse itself.''
   By then, it may be too late for this spring's gathering of
eagles and all their distant cousins. But if spring holds no other
lesson, it is that nature renews, Lethcoe said.
   ``When your child skins her knee for the first time,'' she said,
``you think perfection has been destroyed. But she gets over it.
Given time _ and no more insults _ the sound will recover.''

rebels as they were trying to capture the eastern city of Jalalabad.

   A shallow trench Afghan guerrillas
dug as a rocket-firing position near the Jalalabad airport has
become a killing ground for their own men. They call it Kushtargah,
``the place of slaughter.''
   Bodies of guerrillas, soldiers, civilians and livestock are
scattered along the road to the Pakistan border 45 miles away.
   Explosions of artillery shells and aerial bombs shake the ground
day and night, creating plumes of smoke, dirt and debris.
   Western reporters accompanied 25 guerrillas under a commander
called Shomali on an assault. Insurgents farther back provided
cover with rockets and mortar shells that whistled overhead and
exploded inside the airport.
   Government forces responded with mortar fire and jets came in
low to attack. Two transport helicopters quickly lifted off and
flew away.
   Advancing guerrillas hit a helicopter gunship with a
British-made Blowpipe missile and it crashed inside Jalalabad.
   They covered 50 yards in stop-and-go fashion, arrived at
Kushtargah and spotted a tank at the airport's edge 100 yards away.
   Shomali and his brother, who was second in command, set up a
Milan anti-tank missile with the help of a mujahedeen who looked
about 15 years old.
   The tank fired one shell, a direct hit. Shomali was critically
wounded in the head. His brother and the boy were killed.
   Comrades in the rear continued covering fire. One rocket fell
short and hit the survivors, killing one and wounding three. The
others fled in panic, having spent only a few minutes at ``the
place of slaughter.''
   Insurgents known as mujahedeen, the Islamic ``holy warriors''
who began fighting after a communist coup 11 years ago, besieged
Jalalabad a month ago in their first major offensive since the
Soviet army withdrew Feb. 15.
   They surprised critics by swiftly capturing the heavily
fortified Samarkhel garrison on the city's outskirts, but their
advance has bogged down. The guerrillas advance, shoot, then
retreat under withering artillery and aerial bombardment from
defenders who outgun them with Soviet weapons.
   Mujahedeen use multibarreled rocket launchers, 82mm and 120mm
mortars, and tanks and artillery taken from captured Afghan army
posts, but have difficulty mastering them after a decade of
hit-and-run tactics.
   Soldiers defending the city and its strategic airport appear
well-supplied with such weapons as napalm and airburst artillery.
The artillery and cluster bombs dropped by jets screaming in at low
altitude are particularly deadly.
   Both shells and bombs explode a few hundred feet above the
ground, spraying shrapnel into the trenches.
   Scud-B missiles are feared most. They are fired from government
positions near Kabul and tear craters in the earth 120 feet across.
   No one seems to know how many combatants and civilians have been
killed, and the claims of each about the other's losses are
exaggerated, but it is clear from the scene that the toll has been
high.
   Afghan officials have offered cease-fires and declared them
unilaterally since well before the Red Army ended its nine-year
involvement, and did so again Wednesday, but nothing has come of
the effort.
   The battle continued around Jalalabad, 75 miles east of the
capital, and witnesses and the government said the mujahedeen fired
rockets Thursday at Kabul, Kandahar and Sarobi.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said government
soldiers withheld their fire. The government timed the unilateral
truce to coincide with the eve of Ramadan, the Moslem holy month of
dawn-to-dusk fastingg.
   Associated Press photographer Morten Hvaal saw a missile hit a
fuel truck near a oil depot on Kabul's northern edge and several
trucks parked nearby also exploded. There was no immediate word on
casualties.
   An Afghan truck driver who said he was part of a convoy hauling
fuel down the Salang Highway from Hayratan on the Soviet border
said mujahedeen tried to hijack some of the trucks about six miles
north of Kabul.
   He said the hijackers got about a mile down the road before two
government helicopters attacked. Hvaal saw black smoke rising from
the area.

   A bomb left in a car exploded
outside a government office in Armagh, injuring an elderly woman,
police said.
   The office, where drivers licenses are issued, was badly damaged
but was closed at the time, Belfast police said. Police did not
identify the victim. They said only that she was struck in the head
by flying debris when the bomb, believed to contain 250 pounds of
explosives, went off late Thursday.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility.
   The mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting
British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the Irish Republic, where 95
percent of the population is Catholic.
   Armagh, 35 miles southwest of Belfast, is the religious center
for Ireland, and is where the Catholic and Anglican primates of
Ireland have their seats.
   Until Thursday's bombing, the city had escaped most of the
sectarian and political violence in Northern Ireland over the past
20 years.

   Demonstrations in which Palestinians are injured
are common these days during the 16-month uprising in the occupied
territories. Here is a detailed look at one of them.

   The lieutenant chased the
rock-throwing demonstrators through the dusty streets. He turned
down a corner off the main square, and saw the Palestinian youth in
blue jeans and white sneakers. He knelt and fired.
   The youth fell, blood rushing from his head. ``They've got a
casualty!'' the lieutenant shouted.
   Similar scenes of violence are repeated almost daily in the
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But this time
the Israeli soldiers opened fire in front of reporters and
photographers.
   In Thursday's incident, there were no warning shouts or shots in
the air, and the use of live ammunition seemed to conflict with
army regulations.
   Four soldiers in a jeep rounded a corner into the demonstration.
They were met by about 100 demonstrators who were throwing rocks
and bottles over roadblocks of flaming tires. The soldiers opened
fire almost immediately.
   The victim, 17-year-old Dahoud Khaled Nassar of Bethlehem, was
unconscious and in criticial condition with two bullet wounds to
the head, according to doctors at Mukassed Hospital in Jerusalem.
   The lieutenant, in his late 30s, chased away a reporter and a
television crew who moved toward the stricken youth. He then joined
another officer shooting after youths running down another narrow
street in Bethlehem's Madbasa quarter.
   Residents along the street picked up Nassar's limp body and took
it in a car to nearby Beit Jala Hospital. Doctors there ordered the
victim transferred to the better equipped Mukassed, about six miles
away in Jerusalem.
   An army spokesman, who by military regulation is not identified,
confirmed one youth was shot in a violent confrontation with
soldiers. ``An initial investigation in the field shows that no
live ammunition was fired. We are continuing to investigate,'' she
said.
   An official in the army spokesman's office, who agreed to
discuss army regulations on firing at demonstrators on condition of
anonymity, said ``soldiers can only use live ammunition when their
lives are in danger.''
   He said soldiers can fire plastic bullets to disperse a violent
domonstration, even if their lives are not endangered. But he said
a soldier is only allowed to fire a plastic bullet at a fleeing
suspect who has committed a serious offense, such as a stabbing.
   ``A soldier can't fire at someone running away if the guy has
thrown a rock,'' the official said.
   After Thursday's demonstration, doctors said Nassar was hit with
two live rounds. None of the soldiers was reported injured in the
barrage of rocks and bottles.
   The demonstration had started, like many others, about half an
hour earlier in the commercial district, its streets lined with
shops, restaurants and hotels that used to be crowded with pilgrims
visiting this biblical city where Jesus was born.
   About 100 people, men and women, gathered in a small square.
They set up roadblocks of rocks and burning tires at three points
to block off the area. Many had their faces covered with checkered
Arab keffiyeh headresses or scarves in the red, green, black and
white colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag.
   They carried a flag, too, and chanted ``Allahu Akbar! (God is
great!) Long live the flag!'' They also shouted ``PLO! Israel no!''
and ``Popular revolution against the Zionists!''
   Some of the leaders of the chants seemed to be reading them off
pieces of paper. As they shouted, women in the crowd gathered rocks
from the street, putting them in buckets at street corners in
expectation that soldiers might come.
   They came, four of them in a jeep, after the crowd had been
marching and chanting for about a half hour.
   As is usually the case, the crowd of masked protesters unleashed
rocks and empty bottles at the intruders. Some used slingshots to
fire stones at the soldiers.
   The four soldiers began shooting with rifles almost immediately
after the jeep stopped, with a captain in dark glasses firing from
the driver's seat.
   Israeli and foreign photographers and a young Arab boy wheeling
a bicycle _ who was not part of the protest _ dived for cover.
   Then the soldiers, still firing, began chasing the fleeing
demonstrators through the surrounding streets. Three of the troops
headed down a road to the west, and the lieutenant ran after Nassar
on a street to the east.
   Unlike the others, Nassar had no scarf covering his face.
   After rounding the corner from the square, the lieutenant knelt
with one knee on the dusty pavement, amid stones from a roadblock
placed by the protesters. He took careful aim, and two shots could
be heard.
   About 40 yards away, Nassar fell to the ground, bleeding from
behind his right ear.

   Oliver North firmly defended his Iran-Contra
role Thursday from the witness stand at his criminal trial,
declaring he was merely a Marine following White House orders. ``I
was not stepping in, I was brought in,'' he said.
   North was stopped before he could respond to his lawyer's
suggestion that then-President Reagan had designated him for the
role. Asked directly who told him to secretly help the Nicaraguan
rebels, North named former National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, McFarlane's then-deputy, John Poindexter, and the late
CIA Director William Casey.
   North's testimony came shortly after his lawyers read the jury a
lengthy statement _ agreed to by prosecutors _ that said George
Bush had played a role as intermediary in Reagan's secret effort to
aid the Nicaraguan rebels after Congress banned official U.S. help.
   As rapid-fire developments replaced the sometimes-languid pace
of the trial, now in in its seventh week, the jury heard that Bush
personally told the president of Honduras in 1985 that extra aid
was being funneled to his country. In earlier testimony, McFarlane
had said that the aid was part of a secret agreement calling for
Honduras to help the Contras.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
can't say anything. It would become a part of the case.''
   North, who faces 12 felony charges including lying or misleading
Congress and then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III about his
efforts to help the Contras, testified that he had been ordered by
his superiors to keep silent about his role in keeping the rebels
going after the cutoff of official aid.
   ``I was told not to tell anybody,'' North said. ``I was
particularly admonished'' to keep secret ``that another country was
providing millions of dollars to help the Contras.''
   That was an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia, which supplied
some $32 million in aid to the Contras, beginning in mid-1984.
   North described himself as an orders-obeying Marine who had
planned to return to Camp Lejeune to command a battalion when top
officials in the Reagan administration enlisted him to run the
secret Contra operation in 1984.
   ``Was there a time when you were stepping in'' to help the
Contras? asked North lawyer Brendan Sullivan.
   ``I was not stepping in; I was brought in,'' North replied.
   Sullivan asked whether North ``understood'' that Reagan had
designated him as the Contras' new provider. Prosecutor John Keker
objected; U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sustained the
objection and North didn't answer.
   On point after point, North said he had permission of superiors.
For Project Democracy, as the help to the Contras was known, he
said he had the approval of McFarlane, Poindexter and Casey. The
orders to keep secret the contributions from other countries came
from the president, Casey and McFarlane, he said.
   ``I never made a single trip down there or a single contact,''
North said of his frequent visits to Central America, ``without the
permission, the express permission, of Admiral Poindexter or
McFarlane or usually without the concurrence of Director Casey.''
   McFarlane had testified that he told his staff members the
congressional ban on helping the Contras did apply to them, but
North said ``I never heard'' that.
   As for raising money, he said, referring to himself and
potential contributors, ``I knew Colonel North could not ask them
for money.''
   After the congressional ban cut off official U.S. aid, North
said he told Casey that ``all the money in the world'' wouldn't
replace the former CIA assistance. He said Casey gave him the name
of retired Army Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who ``basically created a
mirror image outside the CIA'' to keep provisions coming.
   Secord, a co-defendant, is to be tried later.
   North testified for about 2{ hours, including recreation of the
half-hour slide show which he gave 75 to 100 times to potential
contributors to the Contras while he was working at the White
House. He will return to the stand Friday morning.
   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel, dressed in a dark suit,
sat down in the witness box nearly two months after the trial began
and nearly two years after he told his story in televised
congressional hearings that made him a national figure. The
congressional testimony was given under a grant of immunity from
prosecution, and prosecutors in the current case have had to avoid
seeing or hearing anything about that appearance.
   ``So you're Colonel North,'' Sullivan began as the former White
House aide took the stand. ``Yes sir, I am,'' North replied with a
smile.
   Earlier, his lawyers spent nearly an hour reading into the
record the ``admission of facts'' concerning the Reagan
administration's efforts supporting the Contra struggle against the
leftist government of Nicaragua.
   In addition to the statements about Bush's involvement, the
document also said that a representative of Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega offered in a meeting with North to assassinate
Sandinista leaders in Nicaragua, but that North replied the United
States wanted no part of that.
   In Panama City late Thursday, Panamanian Maj. Edgardo Lopez
denounced the allegations in a written statement that called it
``another cock-and-bull story of the United States to continue
strangling the Panamanian people and intensify its defamation
campaign against the chief of our Defense Forces.''
   The statement's summary format allowed the trial to proceed
without disclosure of the classified documents that much of the
statement was based upon.
   The document said Bush, who has repeatedly said he had little or
nothing to do with the Iran-Contra affair, relayed a March 1985
Reagan offer of expedited military aid to Honduran president
Roberto Suazo.
   Earlier in the trial, McFarlane testified that Reagan personally
approved the secret deal to slip $110 million in extra aid to
Honduras as one of several ``quid pro quo'' arrangements with other
countries in exchange for support for the Contras.
   The statement on Thursday said, ``Vice President Bush also
informed Suazo that President Reagan had directed that currently
withheld economic assistance for Honduras should be released, that
the United States would provide from its own military stocks
critical security assistance items that had been ordered by
Honduran armed forces, and that several security programs under way
for Honduran security forces would be enhanced.''
   Earlier Thursday, prosecutors asked the judge to order North to
produce his notebooks and ledgers if the former Marine decided to
testify ``and thereby waive his privilege against
self-incrimination.''
   Also on Thursday, former hostage David Jacobsen testified that
when he and North met after Jacobsen's release from Lebanon,
North's eyes filled with tears because other Americans were still
held.

   Kermit the Frog may lament it ain't easy bein'
green, but now he can boast it's easy to be seen on Soviet
television.
   Just call him comrade, because Muppets creator Jim Henson and
his London-based company Henson International Television announced
Thursday ``The Muppet Show'' and ``Fraggle Rock'' will be on Soviet
TV come fall.
   The governing body of Soviet television, Gostelradio, agreed to
allow the shows. The agreement follows the airing in the Soviet
Union of a ``Fraggle Rock'' episode which ``drew unprecedented
rating figures,'' according to a company statement.
   It said 3,500 viewers wrote letters to the network after the
show, and Soviet entrepreneurs have already applied to Henson for
merchandising rights.
   ``I am very pleased that at last our programs and characters
will be seen in the Soviet Union,'' Henson said. ``I've always
worked with an international audience in mind and having our
programs seen in Russia is personally gratifying.''
   ``The Muppet Show'' alone has been seen in more than 100
countries by upward of 235 million people.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
astronomer Carl Sagan says the United States and the Soviet Union
should join forces and head for Mars.
   The show of cooperation between the two superpowers could revive
a space exploration program that has been dormant for 10 years,
Sagan told more than 400 scientists and aerospace specialists
gathered Wednesday for a symposium.
   Sagan joked that the joint mission might trigger a dispute over
who would get to set foot first on Mars. ``I have one solution,''
Sagan said. ``We tie together the ankles of the Soviet and U.S.
(astronauts). Or perhaps a better solution, posed by the Europeans:
Let them be first.''
   Sagan told reporters after his speech that he thinks heading to
Mars is a better next step for space exploration than establishing
a presence on the moon.
   ``The moon worries me,'' Sagan said. ``The moon is dull. We've
been to the moon; it is unchanging ... People are fundamentally
bored with it.
   ``Mars, on the other hand, is a dynamic world. It has weather;
it has climatic change ... It is something that will occupy our
exploratory sense for a great period of time.''

   A scholarship named in honor of singer
Willie Nelson now exists at the University of Texas at Austin.
   The university system's board of regents on Thursday accepted
the Willie Nelson Endowed Presidential Scholarship in the College
of Fine Arts. It was established with a gift of $35,000 from Joseph
D. Jamail, a prominent Houston attorney, and Darrell Royal, former
Texas football coach and men's athletics director. Royal serves as
special assistant to the president on athletics programs at the
Austin campus.
   Income from the endowment will be used for one or more awards
annually to school band members in good academic standing.
   Band Director Glenn Richter said the band plans to make a
recording with Nelson, an Austin resident and golfing buddy of
Royal's.

   ``I don't think it's worthwhile. I don't think it's very

   Comments made over the last 26 years by the reclusive film star,

   If Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Tommy
Lasorda wins his battle against linguine, the Salvation Army will
gain $5,000 for a youth center. But he admits the habit is hard to
break.
   ``Every time I've tried to lose weight, I look at that linguine
and say, `Who's stronger _ you or me?''' Lasorda said.
   Lasorda, 61, weighed in at 202 pounds Wednesday at the Salvation
Army, four pounds shy of the 20 he is trying to lose.
   Covington restaurant owner Jeff Ruby has pledged $5,000 if
Lasorda meets his goal before the All-Star Game on July 11. He said
he will double his contribution if Lasorda keeps off the weight by
season's end.
   Lasorda, in Cincinnati for a Dodgers-Reds series, insisted he'll
have no problem reaching his goal. ``I'll be there next week,'' he
said.
   Lasorda's appetite is legendary in baseball circles, but he
started losing weight in early March when pitcher Orel Hershiser
and leftfielder Kirk Gibson challenged him to shed 20 pounds.
   Ruby, who ran away from home when he was 15 and never returned,
added his challenge after reading a newspaper article about the
need for a youth center in Covington.

<TEXT>
   Mel Gibson, star of ``The Road Warrior'' and
``Lethal Weapon,'' will play the title role in a new film
production of ``Hamlet'' to be directed by Franco Zeffirelli.
   Gibson said Thursday he wants to bring Shakespeare to as wide an
audience as possible.
   ``I would like to make (``Hamlet'') extremely accessible,''
Gibson said in a telephone interview. ``There's no point in doing
anything for an elite.
   ``I love Shakespeare and I always have. But when I was in
school, I didn't think it was accessible at all. It wasn't really
taught to me properly.
   ``But there's no great mystery to Shakespeare. There's love,
hate, passion, sex and violence. It's all there.''
   Gibson said he last performed Shakespeare in Australia 10 years
ago, when he co-starred in ``Romeo and Juliet.'' This is his first
Shakespearean film role.
   Zeffirelli directed the acclaimed 1968 film adaptation of
Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet.''
   ``Hamlet'' will be produced by Dyson Lovell, who just brought
``Lonesome Dove'' to CBS television.
   Additional casting on ``Hamlet'' was not revealed. The movie is
scheduled to begin filming in spring 1990. No release date or
distributor has been announced.

<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
proposal to hold elections among Palestinian Arabs gives at least
temporary momentum to American diplomacy in the Middle East, which
has been at a standstill for months.
   In principle, the proposal won the endorsement of President
Bush, who called on the Palestinians and the Arab states on
Thursday to ``think creatively'' along with Israel about ways to
promote peace in the Middle East.
   The president also offered the good offices of the United States
``to move the peace process forward.''
   So even though Secretary of State James A. Baker III is not
packing his bags yet, and Bush's support for the election of
Palestinian leaders is qualified, the administration can expect to
be critically involved in the explosive situation for the
indefinite future.
   Israel looks to the United States for support, and the Arabs
look for leverage from Washington on Israel. So the
administration's involvement was probably inevitable in any event.
   Strategically, Bush and Baker are pursuing a gradual approach,
but they are also beginning to make their views clear to the
parties.
   They want Israel and the Arabs to negotiate directly with each
other. Therefore, they support a Middle East peace conference only
if it will not get in the way of direct negotiations.
   The United States will keep talking to the Palestine Liberation
Organization, despite Israel's protests, using the dialogue to try
to lower tensions on the West Bank and Gaza.
   Last month, Baker suggested while testifying to a House
subcommittee that maybe Israel should talk to the PLO in order to
have ``meaningful'' negotiations over the Palestinian issue. He
pulled back later, but the idea is still out there and could come
up again.
   On Monday, Bush declared in the presence of visiting Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak that Israel's occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza must come to an end.
   On Thursday, with Shamir at his side, the president got even
tougher on Israel. He said he had told the prime minister ``we do
not support an independent Palestinian state, nor Israeli
sovereignty or permanent occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.''
   The first point is shaded in Israel's favor. Shamir reiterated
during his visit that a Palestinian state would pose an
unacceptable danger to Israel.
   The other two points are sweet music to the Arabs, who demand a
total withdrawal from the lands Israel captured during the 1967
Six-Day war.
   Previous U.S. presidents have said an overall settlement should
involve land-for-peace. That meant Israel should give up territory
in exchange for Arab recognition.
   Bush this week seemed to be taking the U.S. position a couple of
decisive steps further. His statements might preclude Israel
retaining any of the territory.
   If the two sides ever get to the peace table the issues of
Palestinian statehood and Israeli sovereignty will be hotly
contested. Bush's statement is advance notice to Arabs and Israelis
how the United States is likely to come down on these points.
   But, in the meantime, Shamir's proposal to hold elections among
the Palestinians is controversial enough to keep everyone,
including the United States, busy.
   There are lots of questions to be answered.
   When would the election be held? How would it be supervised?
And, most important of all, will Palestinians accept Shamir's
invitation?
   Shamir said at a news conference Thursday the election should be
held in a calm atmosphere. He would like the Palestinians to
suspend their revolt. But the continuing uprising in the
territories may be their strongest card.
   Shamir also said international supervision of the balloting
would not be necessary. He said Israelis and Palestinians would
oversee the election, and that it would be held within Israel's
democratic traditions.
   Will the Palestinians participate? Shamir said he thought they
would, despite the PLO's objections. That remains to be seen.
   Unfazed at the end of a trying day, Baker said he still felt
encouraged.
   ``There will be a number of specific questions with respect to
which there will be differences of opinion,'' he told reporters.
   But, he said, Shamir's election proposal ``affords an
opportunity for a process to begin _ something, if I may say so,
that we did not have before.''

   A document produced in Oliver North's trial
sheds new light on George Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair,
showing that he helped the Reagan administration effort to support
the Nicaraguan Contras despite a ban on U.S. aid.
   The document, read to the Iran-Contra jury by North's defense
attorneys, placed Bush at a May 1985 meeting in Honduras with
then-President Roberto Suazo. It says Bush informed Suazo of
President Reagan's decision to speed U.S. military and economic aid
to the country.
   What set up the Bush meeting were behind-the-scenes discussions
among North and other U.S. officials on a plan to seek assistance
from other countries to tide over the Nicaraguan rebels at a time
when direct or indirect American assistance was outlawed by
Congress.
   A preface to the document said ``the United States has admitted
for purposes of this trial the following facts to be true,'' and it
went to lengths to stitch together how the secret covert support
program worked.
   In effect, the Reagan program established a ``quid pro quo''
relationship basing U.S. assistance to Honduras and some other
countries at least in part on those countries' willingness to help
sustain the Contra fighting force.
   There was no indication that Bush cited this linkage in his
meeting with Suazo. But in earlier testimony, former national
security adviser Robert McFarlane had said the aid was part of a
secret agreement calling for Honduras, in return, to help the
Contras.
   Portions of the document show Bush as an enthusiastic supporter
of the effort to tide over the Contras until direct U.S. assistance
could be resumed.
   In early March 1985, for instance, Bush asked McFarlane whether
he (the vice president) should ``encourage a private group to
donate a planeload of medical supplies that would arrive in
Honduras coincident with'' Bush's meeting with Suazo.
   ``Bush strongly favored such a flight,'' the document said,
``noting that the (unidentified) group was supportive of the
resistance.'' It said North told McFarlane that Bush's idea was
sound. The document did not reveal whether the planeload of
supplies actually arrived in conjunction with his visit.
   Asked on Thursday about the revelation of Bush's go-between role
with the Honduran leader, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said: ``We can't say anything. It would become a part of
the case.''
   Bush has denied ever having any knowledge of a diversion of Iran
arms-sales proceeds to the Contras, although he admitted knowing
about the clandestine arms sales to Iran and said he supported the
initiative with certain reservations. Donald Gregg, his national
security adviser during the period in question, said he did not
tell Bush about the Contra resupply effort that Gregg had learned
about from Felix Rodriguez, a one-time CIA associate.
   Two Maine senators who played key roles in the congressional
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair _ Democrat George Mitchell
and Republican William Cohen _ said in a book published last year
that Bush's role in the scandal remained unanswered.
   And Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Iran-Contra
panel, said in the wake of the congressional probe that the country
still lacked ``a full and complete explanation'' of Bush's role.
   A source who had been involved in the congressional committees'
investigation, who discussed the situation Thursday on grounds of
anonymity, said Bush ``didn't leave very many footprints anywhere.
It needs to be said that the extent of his knowledge was not our
major goal. We were more interested in what the president (Reagan)
knew.''
   But this source also said that ``it was because he left so few
footprints, I think, that he was treated so well in the (final
investigative) report'' by the congressional panel.
   According to the court document, Bush personally told Suazo
during their May 1985 meeting in Honduras that extra aid was being
funneled to his country.
   McFarlane testified Reagan personally approved the secret deal
to slip $110 million in extra aid to Honduras as one of several
``quid pro quo'' arrangements with other countries in exchange for
support for the Contras.
   McFarlane said Reagan telephoned Suazo to gain the release of an
arms shipment to the Contras that had been seized by a Honduran
military commander.
   The statement entered in court said: ``Vice President Bush also
informed Suazo that President Reagan had directed that currently
withheld economic assistance for Honduras should be released, that
the United States would provide from its own military stocks
critical security assistance items that had been ordered by
Honduran armed forces, and that several security programs under way
for Honduran security forces would be enhanced.''
   In a Dec. 3, 1986 speech to the American Enterprise Institute
here _ little more than a week after the Iran-Contra affair broke
into public view _ Bush said that whie he was aware of Reagan's
Iran arms sales and had supported them, ``I was not aware of _ and
oppose _ any diversion of funds, any ransom payments or any
circumvention of the will of the Congress.''
   A presidentially-appointed investigative commission headed by
former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, and a joint congressional panel
found no meaningful role by Bush.
   The newly released document revealed that Bush saw several North
memoranda involving the secret U.S. effort to aid the Contras,
although it did not contradict Bush's assertions that he never knew
about the diversion of the Iranian arms-sales proceeds to the
Nicaraguan resistance.

<HEAD>CDC Releases New Vaccine Recommendations, Stressing When To Shoot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No vaccine is completely safe or effective, but a
highly vaccinated population remains the best way to reduce the
incidence of several once widespread diseases, say federal health
officials.
   The Centers for Disease Control issued its ``General
Recommendations on Immunization'' in a publication directed at
physicians and public health authorities. It is the CDC's first
update of its general recommendations for vaccine policy in six
years.
   In the statement Thursday from its Immunization Practices
Advisory Committee, the Atlanta-based CDC stressed that both
``benefits and risks are associated with the use of all
immunobiologics.''
   ``No vaccine is completely safe or completely effective. ...
Modern vaccines are safe and effective, but not completely so,''
the CDC said, noting that possible side effects range from mild
discomfort to rare, life-threatening illnesses.
   The agency took aim at some common misconceptions about
vaccinations. It said that among the misconceptions heard most
often are that these conditions preclude vaccination: a mild
illness in an otherwise healthy child, mild side effects to a
previous diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis shot, pregnancy of the mother
or someone else in the house, or a non-specific history of
allergies in general.
   ``There have been instances when an outbreak would be
investigated, and we'd ask people why they hadn't been
vaccinated,'' said Dr. Steve Wassilak, a specialist with the CDC's
Division of Immunization.
   ``It turns out to be fairly common that the family went to a
clinic and the child did not receive its vaccination because the
child was ill, with nothing more than a cold,'' he said. ``This is
an effort to remind physicians and nurses ... that they shouldn't
err on the side of not vaccinating as often.''
   However, the CDC added, patients with weakened immune systems _
such as AIDS patients _ should not be given most vaccines made with
live viruses, except under certain conditions. And because of the
risk of infecting a developing fetus, women should not receive live
vaccines, in most cases, if they are pregnant or anticipate
becoming pregnant soon, the CDC said.
   Vaccines are still recommended for most children to prevent such
diseases as polio, measles, mumps and diphtheria. Vaccines also
remain recommended for people at risk of severe complications from
the flu _ such as older people or the chronically ill _ and for
those at increased risk of rabies exposure.

<HEAD>90-Year-Olds Survive Surgery Well, Doctors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgery, like youth, should not be wasted only on
the young, or at least the elderly should feel free to undergo it,
say researchers who found patients in their 90s tolerate operations
relatively well.
   ``If surgery truly can improve the quality of your life, you
should not be inhibited by age,'' said Dr. Mark A. Warner,
co-author of a study on surgery patients 90 years old and older at
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
   ``In the past, people were not being operated on purely because
they were old, and people believed they were frail and they would
not survive the surgery,'' he said in telephone interview Thursday.
   ``We were surprised at how well they did and that the rate of
surgery has increased dramatically'' in the 90-and-up age group, he
said.
   Warner and his colleagues found the 30-day survival rate after
surgery was 91.6 percent among the 795 patients age 90 and older
who underwent operations from 1975 through 1985 at the Mayo Clinic.
   A year after their operations, 68.6 percent of the original
group were still alive, and five years later, 21.2 percent
survived, about the same percentage as would be expected to live
for five years among people the same age who had not had
operations, the researchers said.
   ``These data demonstrate that patients 90 years of age and older
tolerate the stress of a surgical procedure relatively well,'' the
researchers said.
   What the figures don't show is the major improvement in quality
of life _ even if only for a year or two _ that surgery can provide
for extremely elderly patients, Warner said.
   For example, a 95-year-old woman with colon cancer might not be
considered a good candidate for surgery because of the likelihood
the malignancy has spread, he said.
   But forgoing the operation will doom her to bowel obstructions
that will rob her of her independence and keep her bedridden and
miserable for the last six months of her life, he said.
   Surgery may well prolong her life two years, and though she will
likely succumb to spreading cancer, she will remain much more
independent and physically comfortable than she would without
surgery, he said.
   Nationwide, surgical procedures are performed almost five times
as often among 90-year-olds and older people as they were 10 years
ago, the researchers reported in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   As many as 100,000 operations may be performed on the
approximately 1 million Americans in that age group this year,
Warner said.
   The study suggests a dramatic improvement in survival has
occurred in the last 20 years. Two decades ago, a 71 percent
survival rate was reported 30 days after surgery in 90-year-olds
and older undergoing similar procedures, the doctors said.
   Although the recent results are not directly comparable to the
earlier ones, the differences are ``sufficiently striking'' to
suggest that better procedures, anesthesia and medical care have
helped improve the survival rate, the doctors said.
   The most frequently performed procedures in the Mayo Clinic
study were repair of broken hips, heart pacemaker implants, surgery
on the digestive system, prostate operations and hemorrhoid
procedures, he said.

<HEAD>5 Tons Of Marijuana, 4 Boats Seized In Gulf Of Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents seized a tugboat ``mother ship''
loaded with at least five tons of marijuana and three speedboats
that fled at up to 90 mph in a smuggling ploy out of style since
the early 1980s, officials said Thursday.
   The mother ship carrying the marijuana from Mexico was spotted
on radar Wednesday night about 100 miles southwest of Fort Myers on
Florida's Gulf Coast, and 14 people had been detained by late
Thursday, said Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Karonis.
   A new Customs Service plane designed for night surveillance was
in the area by chance on a shakedown training flight and for about
six hours its crew filmed the 105-foot, Honduran-registered mother
ship and six speedboats that rendezvoused with it.
   ``Once the Coast Guard cutter comes in, the speedboats scatter
like a bunch of bees,'' Roger Garland, air branch chief for the
U.S. Customs Service, said as he explained the videotape at a news
conference.
   The sophistication of the operation was almost as surprising to
drug agents as the outmoded mother-ship smuggling method.
   ``From a communications standpoint, when you have an operation
like that, you have a big network,'' Karonis said at the news
conference. ``That's a lot of people willing to stick their necks
out to be involved in some pretty bad activities.''
   In recent years, the most common marijuana smuggling at sea has
been on freighters docking in the Port of Miami, yachts with secret
compartments docking most anywhere and small boats picking up bales
dropped by aircraft.
   ``Something like this is what we had back in the early '80s. It
kind of breaks the trend here,'' said Karonis.
   Garland noted that most recent attention has been focused on
cocaine smuggled through the Bahamas and Haiti.
   In this case, the mother ship, the tugboat Turtola, made its
last port of call in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, about 120 miles
southwest of Veracruz, before entering the Gulf of Mexico bound for
Tampa.
   Surveillance teams noticed several speed boats leaving Gulf
Coast ports late Wednesday when the Turtola neared Florida. The
Coast Guard moved in when four speedboats were gathered at the
mother ship, and six had been spotted at various times.
   The Coast Guard boarded the tug while the crew was working below
deck to sink it, Karonis said. The flooding was brought under
control, the South American crew of five was arrested, and the
Coast Guard counted 165 bales on board. He estimated the total load
was 10,000 to 15,000 pounds.

   Powerboat and sailing enthusiasts may get that
sinking feeling when they enter the Renwick Gallery's new ``boat
show.'' They are greeted by a 28-foot vessel whose hull is woven
from eight bales of sweet-smelling alfalfa hay.
   This is art, folks.
   Sixteen contemporary American artists are inviting viewers to
join them on a voyage of the imagination in vessels of wood, glass,
ceramics, metals, textiles, hay and straw, back to antiquity and
forward to the unknown.
   Voyages depart daily free of charge from the Renwick, a gallery
of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art just down
Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. The show opens today and
runs through Aug. 6.
   ``The show will be a surprise and astonishment,'' said the
Renwick's Jeremy Adamson, curator of the exhibition. ``These are
not pleasure boats or pirate ships or sailing yachts. These are
boats of mythology and fantasy and archaic symbolism.''
   Artist Michael Shaughnessy built his ``Hayboat'' with a wood
frame, a warp of twine and handfuls of alfalfa hay trucked in from
rural Virginia and his native Maine, where he is a teacher at the
University of Southern Maine.
   The humble stuff of animal fodder and primitive huts is his
favorite sculptural material, Shaughnessy says, because hay
symbolizes the bond between man and nature and is as ``near the
truth as any material I have ever found.''
   John Roloff, an artist from Oakland, Calif., fashioned the
jutting bow prow of a glass-paned ship resembling a greenhouse,
which appears to be sinking into the gallery floor.
   Inside the vessel are rocks and misting waters taken from
Pyramid Lake, what's remaining of an ancient sea called Lake
Lahontan which covered a vast area in northern Nevada during the
Ice Age. Roloff said the sinking ship represents his lament for the
lost purity of the Western wilderness.
   Another dramatic boat is Robert Hubany's ``Valhalla Vertical
Triptych,'' an ascending complex of glowing coals, bubbling lights,
ceramic corn stalks, snake-covered ladders and recorded drumbeats,
with fish at the bottom and carved birds circling overhead.
   Hubany says the boat ``suggests a symbolic passage to
self-discovery or enlightenment.''
   Ann McCoy's ``Barque with Lion Goddess III'' employs the
religious imagery and feminine deities of ancient Egypt, Greece and
Rome _ plus her sleep therapy with a psychoanalyst _ to suggest ``a
voyage through the night and the dream world of the subconscious.''
   Robert Shay, a potter, ceramics teacher and chairman of the Ohio
State University art department, contributed a pockmarked ceramic
boat with glassy deck, but says he prefers pots over boats.
   ``I hate boats,'' Shay says. ``They make me seasick.''

   The Soviet Union will begin a partial
withdrawal of its 62,000 troops in Hungary on April 25, Budapest
Radio reported.
   Government spokesman Gyoergy Marosan told the radio Thursday
that the partial pullout will end by late June.
   Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ferenc Karpati announced in January
that preparations for the withdrawal were almost complete and that
an armored division would be among the major units leaving.
   In a speech Dec. 7 to the United Nations, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised a unilateral reduction of 500,000
Soviet troops over two years, including withdrawing 50,000 Red Army
men and 5,000 tanks from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   Hungarian officials said Soviet armed forces stationed here
would be cut by at least 25 percent.

   Oliver North, testifying in his own defense,
says top-level Reagan administration officials put him in charge of
keeping the Nicaraguan rebels alive and ordered him to maintain
total secrecy about the operation.
   The CIA had been supplying the Contras, but by October 1984 when
Congress banned further military aid ``every bit of that CIA
responsibility had been passed on to me,'' North told the jury at
his criminal trial Thursday. ``It was basically a handoff as in
basketball.''
   The former National Security Council aide took the witness stand
in his own defense for nearly 2{ hours. The 12 criminal charges
against him focus on his alleged lies to Congress and the attorney
general about his efforts on behalf of the Contras.
   Then-national security adviser Robert McFarlane told him his
role as overseer of the Contra network ``could not be revealed,''
North testified.
   The admonition ``was reiterated innumerable times by Admiral
Poindexter and by Director Casey,'' said North, referring to
McFarlane's successor John Poindexter and CIA Director William
Casey.
   North said his superiors told him disclosure ``would jeopardize
the people doing it, the pilots shipping supplies'' and others in
the aid network. In addition, public exposure would ``jeopardize
the CIA's ability to move back in'' because publicity would make it
less likely Congress would restore military assistance.
   North's testimony was preceded by a series of new disclosures
about the Reagan administration's secret assistance to the Contras.
Among the revelations in the written admissions of fact:
   _Vice President George Bush was an intermediary in a secret plan
approved by Reagan and disclosed earlier at North's trial to slip
Honduras an extra $110 million in aid if it would help support the
Contras. Bush told President Roberto Suazo that ``President Reagan
had directed expedited delivery of U.S. military items to
Honduras'' as well as other steps helpful to Honduras.
   _North met in London in mid-1986 with Panamanian strongman
Manuel Noriega, who ``would try to take immediate actions against
the Sandinistas.'' Noriega offered a list of priorities including
``an oil refinery, an airport and the Puerto Sandino off-load
facility.''
   _In an earlier meeting, a representative of Noriega had said the
Panamanian leader was offering to ``assassinate the Sandinista
leadership for the U.S. government.'' In exchange he wanted a
promise from the U.S. government to help clean up Noriega's image
and a commitment to lift the U.S. ban on military sales to the
Panamanian military. U.S. law forbade assassinations, North told
the representative, who countered by pointing to Noriega's help to
the U.S. government ``the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista
arsenal.'' When North reported back to his boss, Poindexter said
the U.S. government ``could not be involved in assassination, but
Panamanian assistance with sabotage would be another story.''
   _In early 1985, President Reagan ``urged the head of state of
Saudi Arabia to continue its support for the resistance. Saudi
Arabia subsequently made a contribution of more than $25 million.''
   _In a scheme initiated by Casey and known as Operation Tipped
Kettle, Israel on two occasions secretly supplied the Defense
Department with weapons it had confiscated from the PLO. The CIA
advised Congress the weapons would be used for various purposes,
but ``in fact many of them were provided'' to the Contras as
congressionally appropriated funds ran out. The Defense Department
said it would find a way to compensate Israel for its assistance.
   In his testimony, North said that when he needed to set up a
secret shipping network to funnel supplies to the rebels, he went
to Casey and got the name of Richard Secord.
   At the time, Saudi Arabia was pouring at least $1 million a
month into Contra bank accounts, but ``I told Casey all the money
in the world'' wouldn't keep the rebels in the field.
   ``He basically created a mirror image outside the CIA,'' North
said of the network of private companies Secord set up to supply
the rebels. Charged in the Iran-Contra affair with North, Secord
will be tried separately later.
   North depicted himself as a military officer trying to do his
job and looking forward to heading for Camp Lejeune to command a
Marine battalion after a grueling stint at the National Security
Council in Washington.
   ``You had been there three years?'' at the NSC, asked Sullivan.
   ``Three years too long,'' replied North.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Against Supranational Climate Authority</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, saying it is
premature to consider a sweeping ``law of the air,'' opposes the
idea of an international authority to protect the world against
changes in climate.
   William A. Nitze, deputy assistant secretary of state for the
environment, told members of Congress on Thursday that some
countries seek an international agreement and it will be discussed
at meetings of existing international bodies.
   It may also come up when President Bush goes to Paris this year
for the annual summit meeting of heads of government of Western
nations and Japan.
   ``We believe it is premature, however, to be considering a
sweeping `law of the air' or supranational authorities to deal with
climate change, as some have recently advocated,'' Nitze said.
   A world climate conference is scheduled next year.
   A French-organized meeting of 24 governments in The Hague in the
Netherlands, including France, West Germany, Norway and the
Netherlands, issued a statement May 11 suggesting the possibility
of a supranational organization but not endorsing it. The United
States was not invited to the meeting.
   A ``law of the air'' might be similar to the ``law of the sea,''
a treaty that was negotiated through the United Nations. The United
States has opposed it, and it has not gone into effect. The
Canadian government has suggested an international law of the air.
   Nitze was testifying before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee's subcommittee on human rights and international
organizations.
   He said the United States will have to evolve its domestic
strategy and then develop an active international strategy to deal
with changes in climate.
   He forecast a 50 percent chance that by the year 2100 average
temperatures will be 2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit higher than they
are today.
   Such a change could affect all nations and every human activity,
he said _ winds and current would be altered, some areas would get
more rain and some less, the sea would rise and threaten what has
been built on shores.
   But he added that the predictions are uncertain because they do
not take into account the impact of cloud cover, the reactions
between air and ocean and other variables.

<HEAD>Dismal Sugaring Season Winds Down In Southern New England</HEAD>

   The sap from maple trees is running so
slow in parts of the Northeast that some towns have canceled their
annual pancake breakfasts for lack of syrup.
   ``One guy told me he didn't do enough to cover his pancakes,''
said Wilson Clark, president of the Vermont Maple Sugarmakers'
Association.
   The season for tapping maple trees for sap, which is boiled down
to syrup, is nearing the end in southern New England amid signs
that warm weather and an insect with a taste for maples will
sharply lower syrup production.
   ``Everybody is down at least 50 percent to 75 percent, with more
on the heavy side,'' said Edward McColgan, president of the
Massachusetts Maple Sugar Producers Association.
   McColgan blamed erratic weather for a poor season in the state,
which usually produces 50,000 gallons of syrup annually. Vermont,
the nation's top syrup producing state, may be headed for its
fourth subpar season in a row. And New York, the second largest
producer, appears headed for a bad season.
   But farmers in Wisconsin, the No. 3 producer, and northern
Vermont say continued cold spells have brought an average-to-good
season so far.
   In most places, the news isn't so sweet. ``First it got cold and
stayed cold, so the sap didn't run, and then it warmed up too
fast,'' McColgan said. ``Now we have temperatures in the 40s, but
with all the rain it isn't getting cold enough at night to keep the
trees from budding.''
   Some towns in the Berkshire Hills in western Massachusetts have
canceled pancake breakfasts. ``We just didn't feel right about
asking for donations of syrup this year,'' said breakfast
chairwoman Helen Wells of Cummington.
   In upstate New York, Earl Parker, president of the New York
State Maple Producers Association, said the yield in the
Adirondacks could be down by half. Southern Vermont farmers called
it their worst season in decades.
   On top of the bad weather, defoliation of maple trees by the
pear thrip caused most producers in Massachusetts and southern
Vermont to cut back on their taps. More than 25 percent didn't tap
at all.
   The flea-sized insect was first introduced to California from
Europe in 1904. Last spring, thrips spread across 2 million acres
of maples in southern Vermont and New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
eastern New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.
   With sugaring still under way in northern Vermont, New York and
Wisconsin, officials said it was too early to predict how producers
will fare.
   But retail prices, which nearly doubled during a shortage three
years ago, appeared to be holding at last year's level of $35 to
$45 per gallon, according to Arthur Merle of Attica, N.Y.,
president of the North American Maple Syrup Producers Association.
   ``This year was so bad that it didn't seem it would make any
difference if I charged another $5 a gallon,'' McColgan said.
   Vermont produced 523,000 gallons of syrup in 1985, but early
thaws have cut production in each of the last three years.
Vermont's crop last year was 370,000 gallons; New York had 310,000
gallons, followed by Wisconsin with 125,000 gallons.

   ``So you're Colonel North?''
   It was a question that did not need to be asked, but he answered
anyway, as laughter swept the crowded courtroom.
   ``Yes, I am.''
   ``It's traditional to start with your name,'' said his lawyer.
   ``Oliver Laurence-with-a-U North,'' said the defendant.
   In nearly two months of testimony, North had been depicted as a
hard-charging Marine lieutenant colonel who single-handedly
supplied a rebel army, raised millions of dollars, supervised arms
shipments to Iran, deceived Congress and violated its laws, and in
general was a loose cannon who was viewed with some suspicion by
his colleagues at the National Security Council.
   On the witness stand, speaking softly to a jury that must decide
his fate, he appeared as an earnest, soft-spoken middle-aged man
with gray hair, who insisted he only acted to keep the Nicaraguan
contras alive until Congress once again favored them with money to
fight their battle.
   He didn't ask for the assignment on the NSC, he said; in fact,
``I told everyone along the line I wanted to go back to the Marines
where my talents lie.''
   He was just another of a number of political-military affairs
officers t the NSC charged with coordinating things in their areas.
His orders came from two successive national security advisers,
Robert C. McFarlane, a former Marine, and John M. Poindexter, a
three-star admiral in the Navy. And his relationship with the late
CIA director William Casey was not as friend or buddy, but as ``a
subordinate to a superior.''
   He said he wanted to go back to the Marines after his three-year
tour at the NSC was up but McFarlane said, ``Look, there's much
more than being a battalion commander,'' even though that's what he
wanted to be.
   Nearly two years ago, North took a witness's oath in a hearing
room on Capitol Hill, his hair cropped to proper Marine-officer
length with six rows of ribbons on his chest attesting to a
distinguished military record. In court, the hair still was short,
but the uniform now was civilian dark blue suit, red and blue
striped tie and white shirt. He said ``yes, sir'' and ``no, sir,''
often.
   Most of the time his hands were folded on the small table in
front of the witness chair. But they became animated when he
talked, first, about his family, and then his NSC job.
   Married to Betsy, sitting in the front row, 26 years. Four
``lovely'' children, the oldest 19, the youngest eight today.
Father was in U.S. Army, mother a school teacher. Educated in
public and Catholic schools. U.S. Naval Academy, commissioned in
1968 as a Marine second lieutenant.
   He did the things young Marine officers did, he said. In the
summer he volunteered for jump school at Ft. Benning, Ga. He did
some boxing and even, sometimes, ``was lucky enough to win.''
   North quickly hurried over his Vietnam service. He was ``in
about 100 engagements, I guess.'' Earned the Silver Star, the
Bronze Star, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Navy Achievement
Medal, a couple of purple hearts.
   He had an opportunity in court that he didn't get on Capitol
Hill: he gave the jury the same slide show about Central America
that he gave 75 to 100 times while on the NSC to as few as three
people and as many as several hundred.
   For the jury he lectured in the same pained voice as when h's
lecturing for $20,000 a throw.
   ``The Soviet policy goal is to create turmoil in the Caribbean
basin. ... The Soviet Union in this hemisphere is outspending us
4-1. ... Between the Rio Grande and Panama 100 million people are
threatened. ... In Nicaragua in 1985 was the largest standing army
that's ever been seen in Central America.''
   Pictures of Contras. ``These people have become the Nicaraguan
resistance. ... They didn't get drafted, they volunteered.''
   And so the drama played before a jury that appeared to pay more
attention than any time before in the trial.

   The head of a Delaware-based aerospace company
says the United States leads Japan in developing aircraft wings out
of non-metallic composites, contradicting one of the claimed
benefits of the FSX fighter deal.
   ``In my opinion, the Japanese have the most to gain from the FSX
program in terms of gaining a total understanding of the complete
system required to produce an effective `composite' aircraft,''
said James N. Burns, a vice president of Hercules Inc., an
aerospace company based in Wilmington.
   Burns was one of several executives from the aerospace and
electronics industry to testify Thursday over whether the FSX
fighter deal with Japan amounts to a net technological boon or loss
for the United States.
   The testimony before three House Science subcommittees came in
anticipation of the Bush administration's agreement being sent to
Capitol Hill shortly.
   Under the deal, St. Louis-based General Dynamics and Japan's
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would co-develop and co-produce the
FSX, an advanced version of the U.S. F-16 fighter, for deployment
by Japan in the late 1990s.
   The deal has prompted criticism that it would amount to a $7
billion giveaway of valuable American technology likely to be used
by Japan to help propel its own aircraft industry into head-to-head
competition with the United States in the world market.
   Proponents have argued that the deal would allow the United
States to benefit from technological advances by the Japanese in
composite wing construction and advanced radar.
   Composites are tough, lightweight materials that utilize carbon
fiber and epoxy resin in place of metal.
   Burns told the hearing that successful application of composites
requires sophisticated computer programs and a detailed array of
data describing performance of the materials under various
conditions.
   ``In both areas, the United States is obviously well ahead of
the Japanese because of the many aircraft applications in the
United States which employ carbon fiber composites today,'' he
said. ``The United States has been the world leader in this field,
indisputably.''
   John Mancini, a vice president of the American Electronics
Association, said the electronics group still has reservations
about the deal but may be willing to soften its opposition in view
of ``encouraging signs from the Bush administration that they are
determined to tighten the agreement.''
   Mancini said the association's board initially had decided to
oppose the FSX because it ``felt that the agreement provides no
real benefit to the American electronics industry and will
accelerate the Japanese as competitors in the world avionics
arena.''
   The association represents more than 3,500 U.S. companies
involved with electronics and information technology.
   Testifying in favor of the FSX was Joel L. Johnson,
international vice president of the Aerospace Industries
Association of America.
   ``We believe that at this time the FSX deal as negotiated is
probably about the best agreement that is realistically
achievable,'' he said. ``We would encourage the U.S. government to
move forward with the agreement, with the proviso that the U.S.
government should monitor closely the willingness of Japan to make
available technology to the United States.''
   Johnson added: ``We should continue to press the Japanese for an
equitable share of production of the aircraft as well. But we do
not believe that it would be in our interest to encourage the
Japanese to walk away from this agreement and pursue their original
objective of building a new aircraft without U.S. involvement.''

<HEAD>5,000 Tons of Butter, Oil Sold to Brazil at Bargain Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has sold 5,000
metric tons of surplus butter and butteroil to Brazil for $9.85
million, a fraction of what the government paid for it under the
dairy price support program.
   Richard W. Goldberg, acting undersecretary, said Thursday that
the 2,000 tons of butteroil and 3,000 tons of butter were sold by
the department's Commodity Credit Corp. to Petrobras Comercio
Internacional S.A.-Interbras, a Brazilian state trading company.
   Deliveries of the surplus products are scheduled through
September. No credit arrangements were involved.
   Federal laws, including last year's Hunger Relief Act, mandate
the export sale of 150,000 tons of dairy products annually through
September 1990. So far this fiscal year, sales have totaled 15,763
tons, Goldberg said.
   According to a recent report on CCC holdings, surplus butter as
of Jan. 31 totaled about 155,000 metric tons and butteroil, 1,640
tons. A metric ton is approximately 2,205 pounds.
   The report showed that CCC had an investment of about $1.46 per
pound in the butter and $1.64 in the oil. The price charged to
Brazil was about 84 cents per pound for the butter and 98 cents for
the butteroil.
   Sales are made to foreign buyers at approximately the prevailing
world market prices so as not to undercut other foreign suppliers.
   The CCC buys surplus dairy products to support the price of milk
paid to farmers.

   They argued passionately, they joked, they
discussed their grandchildren and they were solemn.
   And after four hours of talks Thursday, the unlikely
relationship between Margaret Thatcher, the doctrinaire
anti-communist, and Mikhail Gorbachev, the new-look leader of the
Soviet Union, had reached new heights.
   The Soviets struggled for superlatives.
   ``I am at a loss for words,'' said Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, after Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher met
Thursday. ``Any positive adjective you would like to use you can
apply to the talks.''
   ``This was the day when the relationship between them did reach
a new high ... characterized by one word, and that is openness,''
said a British spokesman.
   They have not gone to the first-name terms that characterized
Mrs. Thatcher's friendship with Ronald Reagan. But they have a
spark of chemistry that Sir Bryan Cartledge, former British
ambassador to Moscow, explains as the attraction of a communist and
a conservative who are really quite similar.
   ``They're both radicals,'' said Cartledge, who watched Mrs.
Thatcher in action in Moscow two years ago. ``Neither of them has
much time for empty rhetoric. They get down to business very
quickly and very easily.''
   It was like that from their first meeting in 1984 when
Gorbachev, then No. 2 in the Kremlin, came to London. Mrs. Thatcher
declared then: ``I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business
together.''
   And they have. This week's 40-hour visit was the third time
Gorbachev has singled Mrs. Thatcher out for special treatment,
following her trip to the Soviet Union in April 1987 and his
stopover in Britain that December en route to a Washington summit.
   She admires a leader who is trying to change everything, just as
she set out to do 10 years ago with her own perestroika, or
economic restructuring, when she ousted a Labor Party government
and pledged to wipe out socialism from Britain.
   ``He is trying to do for the Soviet economy what we have done
for the British economy in the last 10 years,'' said British
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe in an interview this week with
ABC News.
   They also saw each other clearly from the start, said Howe: she
recognized that, however reformist, he will always be a communist;
he acknowledged she is a diehard capitalist.
   ``So there was a clarity of understanding from the outset and I
think that he recognizes in her a determined, successful political
leader. She recognizes the same in him. So they have many points on
which they would like, as it were, to compare notes.''
   They also complement each other's political needs. Through
Gorbachev, Mrs. Thatcher can project the kind of statesmanship that
puts the Great back in Britain. Gorbachev, for his part, knows that
if he is to woo Western opinion, he must first win the sympathy of
Europe's staunchist conservative.
   In unusually colorful language, a Thatcher spokesman said
Thursday's talks were ``animated, warm, passionate and sometimes
solemn.''
   ``They love arguing,'' he added, requesting anonymity. ``They
have this way of arguing very strongly but never losing their
tempers.''
   In public with Mrs. Thatcher, Gorbachev was quick to joke. She
called the rain ``a natural massage'' when he arrived Wednesday. He
corrected her when she said they'd had 2{ hours of talks. That was
the formal agenda, he noted, but they'd talked for another 90
minutes.
   ``We continued until this very moment without even breaking our
conversation for lunch,'' he said, conveying the impression of two
powerful people who have a lot to talk about and too little time to
say it.
   In private, officials reported personal exchanges too.
Gorbachev, 58, a grandfather of two, congratulated 63-year-old Mrs.
Thatcher on the birth last month of her first grandchild.
   Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher share an intense dislike for
entrenched bureaucracy. As an associate once remarked, ``Mrs.
Thatcher cannot look at an institution without wanting to hit it
with her handbag.''
   Gorbachev showed his sense of humor. When Mrs. Thatcher reached
for her handbag during their talk, he quickly remarked: ``Ah, the
handbag.''

<HEAD>Excerpts from North Testimony at Iran-Contra Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of testimony by Oliver North
on Thursday in the Iran-Contra trial as he was questioned by
defense attorney Brendan Sullivan.
   
   SULLIVAN: So, you're Colonel North?
   NORTH: Yes, sir, I am.
   SULLIVAN: It's traditional to start with stating your full name
and _
   NORTH: Oliver Laurence, with a U, North.
   SULLIVAN: Colonel North, it's been two and a half years or so
since you've left the National Security Council in November 1986,
hasn't it?
   NORTH: Yes, sir, it has. ...
   SULLIVAN: Now, describe for the jury the circumstances of your
having been assigned to the National Security Council?
   NORTH: I was a student enrolled in the Naval War College which
is the commanding staff course as a major and one afternoon I was
pulled out of class and told to come down and interview here in
Washington with a number of general officers for an assignment in
Washington. I did so, of course, and found myself interviewing with
the commandant of the Marine Corps, I guess that day or the next
day, and the secretary of the Navy and was sent over to the White
House to interview with the national security advisor.
   SULLIVAN: Did you ever ask for the assignments?
   NORTH: No, sir, I told each one of them along the line that I
would prefer to go back to the Marines which is where I thought my
talents were. ...
   SULLIVAN: Is it fair to say that your work in the five and a
half years you were there, Colonel North, was focused on three
basic areas, one of which would be the secret project which has
never been revealed and is not part of the case and the other two
would be counter terrorism and Central America problems?
   NORTH: Yes, sir, those would be the three principal areas of
responsibility. It didn't come all at once but it came in phases.
...
   SULLIVAN: Tell us at this point about your relationship with
William Casey, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency as
of the spring of 1984? First off, tell the jury who he was. They've
heard a lot about him, but who he was from your point of view?
   NORTH: Director Casey was in my humble estimation a remarkable
man. He was _ at age 70 plus had more energy than I have or even
these lawyers of mine. He was able to go a full day of work at 12,
14 hours a day. ... And he was also, as he frequently reminded
people around him a, and no offense intended counsel, but he was a
very good lawyer and he reminded people of that.
   SULLIVAN: What was your relationship to him on a business level?
You're a young Marine officer and he's a Cabinet officer.
   NORTH: It was _ notwithstanding what others have said _ I did
not consider Director Casey to be a friend or a buddy or anything
like that. He was a man that I respected and admired. ... I believe
it was one of subordinate to a superior.
   SULLIVAN: Did there come a time in 1984 when the CIA was getting
out of the business of assisting the freedom fighters that you were
stepping in to fulfill that kind of a role?
   NORTH: Well, I was not stepping in. I was basically broadening _
Marines, I guess, want to volunteer for things but I _ I believe _
if Director Casey and what he and Mr. McFarlane said was that the
case was, and that's all I have to go on was what they said to me,
as this political dispute got worse in the spring of 1984 the
president had chaired a number of meetings of what was called when
I worked down there the National Security Planning Group. ... That
group met a number of times in the spring looking for alternatives
to how we were going to continue to support the resistance. I
attended a number of those meetings as the note taker, not as a
participant. ... It was very clear that they wanted to find some
way of continuing the support ... that the President was adamant
that those people that we had put in the field, that we had armed
and equipped and sent into combat, should not be abandoned.
   As a consequence of one of those meetings, Mr. McFarlane told me
to, first of all, make contact with a resistance leader in Central
America. ... I was told to go to Director Casey, find out which of
these resistance leaders should receive funding and to get foreign
accounts into which to put that money. I did so.

   SULLIVAN: Now, sir, in the spring of 1984, you had been at the
NSC for about three years, correct?
   NORTH: Three years too long, yes, sir.
   SULLIVAN: And that was a time when an officer would normally go
back to normal uniformed Marine duties, correct?
   NORTH: Yes, sir.
   SULLIVAN: What happened that prevented you from going back to
the Marine Corps at the end of your three-year tour at the NSC?
   NORTH: I probably learned a little bit about it right here in
this courtroom because I didn't know all of what you have come to
know about that. I, a number of times, had discussions with Mr.
McFarlane, who was my boss, with Don Fortier who was my immediate
superior, to the effect that I had orders and was going to go back
to Camp Lejeune. At one of the meetings I had with Director Casey
about the time all of this is being set up down south, he told me
that, look, there is more important things than being the battalion
commander, which is what I wanted to be. ... I expressed to him my
reservations about staying at the NSC, and he said well, we will
take care of that. And, indeed, he did, or someone did, because I
was called by the commandant of the Marine Corps and told that I
would not be detached from the NSC and wasn't given a chance to _ I
guess Marines shouldn't be _ whine about it. ...
   SULLIVAN: Now, once the CIA is out and the freedom fighters are
left on their own, how did they function at that time period in
October 1984? What were the problems?
   NORTH: ... Everything that they had from the little tents that
they lived in to the homes that they had for their children, to the
food they ate, the weapons they carried, the bullets that they had,
everything had come from the CIA. All of the intelligence, all of
the operations planning. ... through the summer ... slowly but
surely more and more of that CIA responsibility had been, I
suppose, passed on to me. ... basically, what we would call a hand
off, just like in basketball, I suppose, you got the ball, go on
with it. ...
   SULLIVAN: Did you understand your assignment to be directly from
the president with his words that Mr. McFarlane uttered here in
court about keeping them together body and soul?
   MR. KEKER: Objection, your honor. Leading. ...
   SULLIVAN: What did you understand your assignment to be?
   NORTH: I understood it very clearly to be that I would be the
one to replace the CIA for each of these activities.
   JUDGE GESELL: Who told you that?
   NORTH: Mr. McFarlane told me. Admiral Poindexter told me.
Director Casey told me. On a number of occasions, I was told not to
tell other people, not to talk about it, to keep my operational
role very, very secret, that it should not be something that others
came to know about. I was particularly admonished that this should
never, ever be revealed, the fact that another country was
providing millions of dollars to help the resistance.
   SULLIVAN: Now, colonel, part of your responsibilities at the NSC
were very public in terms of briefings and things that you would
give, is that correct?
   NORTH: ... Many of us did briefings on our respective areas of
responsibility to the American people. ...
   SULLIVAN: You have heard evidence in the court about the fact
that some of the donors, like Mrs. Garwood and Mrs. Newington,
attended those briefings at functions organized by Mr. Channell's
organization, NEPL, correct?
   NORTH: Yes, sir.
   SULLIVAN: About how many briefings would you have given over the
course of the time you were at the NSC on the subject of Nicaragua
and its needs?
   NORTH: I would guess I probably gave, ballpark, 75 to 100
briefings total, in the period of time 1983 through the time I left
the NSC in 1986. ...
   SULLIVAN: Now, sir, Colonel North, focusing on the time period
in 1984 when money is no longer being provided to the CIA to
provide support to the resistance and you have had a hand off, so
to speak, what were the ways that the administration looked out to
help the resistance fighters?
   NORTH: ... The first steps that were taken were to get financing
from foreign countries. That was initiated by, as I described it,
Mr. McFarlane and Director Casey giving me the person to be in
touch with.
   SULLIVAN: Now, this was called third country support?
   NORTH: I would call it third country financial support. Yes.
   SULLIVAN: ... How was money raised from other countries?
   NORTH: Initially by Mr. McFarlane contacting directly the
ambassador of Saudi Arabia. ... Money went in I think at the rate
of about a million dollars a month which turned out to be not
enough, and so I went back to Mr. McFarlane and said we need more
money and at some point later on in either late '84 or early '85
the president asked the king for more and the king chipped in a
total, I think, of 32 million over that period of time.

<TEXT>
   SULLIVAN: Now, what was your understanding regarding the
confidentiality of that kind of relationship between Saudi Arabia
and the United States in giving that kind of money?
   NORTH: ... I was told point blank by Mr. McFarlane not to reveal
that to anyone, that that was the direction of the president of the
United States, that I would not, could not reveal it. In fact, was
chastised for letting Director Casey know that this whole thing was
proceeding as it was. ...
   SULLIVAN: Were there other countries that assisted the United
States when the Congress wouldn't give money?
   NORTH: Yes, there were, there were other countries that provided
$2 million in the case of Taiwan. There was eventually $10 million
from _ the country of Brunei made an effort to submit but due to a
numerical error in the account it never arrived. ...
   SULLIVAN: Now, aside from money, once you get friendly nations
providing some money to support the freedom fighters did you also
establish what was called Project Democracy?
   NORTH: ... as the money began to flow Director Casey and then
the people from the Central Intelligence Agency, others individuals
... pointed out the need to expand the activities, to basically try
to replace the CIA's full service, if you will, to the resistance
and I went back to Director Casey. ... I asked him for the name of
a person who would be able to do these things and he gave me the
name of General Richard Secord. ... and so I went to General Secord
and he basically set up to provide those kinds of services to the
resistance that the CIA had provided before but to do it outside
the U.S. government.
   SULLIVAN: Did you talk with Mr. Casey about the applicability of
the Boland Amendment to the National Security Council?
   NORTH: I talked to Director Casey. I talked to Mr. McFarlane. I
talked to the NSC lawyers ... none of them thought that it applied
to the NSC.
   SULLIVAN: When Secord was brought into the picture and he
developed these companies was that an effort to comply with the law?
   NORTH: Well, precisely because what General Secord did was to
set up a series of organizations that would do what the CIA had
done before ... he basically created a mirror image outside the
government of what the CIA had done.
   SULLIVAN: What kind of projects was he working on particularly?
   NORTH: Well, he started out basically delivering munitions. ...
it got to the point where when a southern front became an absolute
necessity, he was the one who contracted to build that airfield in
Costa Rica. I guess the other part of that that's not real clear is
that we had ... to work with the neighboring countries. ...
   SULLIVAN: Now, sir, when Secord is operating out of these
neighboring countries, is it necessary for high level American
officials to have permission from the officials of those countries?
   NORTH: Yes. ... it would be impossible to do these things
without the permission of the highest levels of their governments.
I mean, it would be a disaster if you tried to do it without their
help. ... In some cases I even had to meet with the presidents of
those countries so that those people would agree to the kinds of
support and the kinds of measures that we were taking. ...
   SULLIVAN: Now, whenever you had such a contact with an official
of a neighboring country in Central America, would you always have
the permission of your superiors?
   NORTH: Yes, sir. I never made a single trip down there, whether
it was an official trip that was paid for by the NSC or whether it
was a trip that was paid for out of the resistance funds, never
made a single trip, never made a single contact with anybody down
there without the permission, express permission, of either Mr.
McFarlane or Admiral Poindexter, and usually, when I could, with
the concurrence of Director Casey.

   SULLIVAN: During the time that you were acting in the capacity
of trying to keep the freedom fighters alive, did any of your
superiors, McFarlane or Poindexter or the president or anyone else,
say to you, Ollie, the Boland Amendment precludes you from engaging
in these activities?
   NORTH: Never.
   SULLIVAN: Such as airstrips?
   NORTH: Never.
   SULLIVAN: Or shipping weapons or doing one thing or another?
   NORTH: Never.
   SULLIVAN: Never heard that?
   NORTH: No, sir, not from the people I worked with. ... none of
the people I worked for ever told me that anything we did was
illegal. It was specifically done to avoid breaking the law.
   SULLIVAN: Did the president himself act to facilitate help for
the freedom fighters, for example, by calling the presidents of
foreign countries?
   NORTH: Yes, sir.
   SULLIVAN: Now, we have three ways you have talked about: third
countries, Project Democracy, the neighbors in the area, and would
there be a last one, the private citizens in America such as Mrs.
Garwood that the jury met, who would contribute to this effort?
   NORTH: Yes, sir. ...I was authorized to go and brief these
people. I was told specifically that I could not personally, me
Ollie North, ask them for money; that I was a government official.
   SULLIVAN: What did you understand that to mean, Colonel North?
   NORTH: I understood that I wouldn't ask people for money, and I
didn't ... My role was simply to be one of explaining what the
threat was to the United States ... but that I would not ever say,
now, Mrs. Jones, or, Mrs. Smith, or, Mr. so and so, would you
please give money. And I never did that.
   SULLIVAN: You are accused in this case, Colonel North, of
conspiracy to commit a tax fraud. Did you do so?
   NORTH: No, sir, I did not.
   SULLIVAN: Did you ever talk with any of the donors about their
taxes or how they should give to get deductions?
   NORTH: Never.
   SULLIVAN: With respect to these areas of activity, did you
regard or were you told that your activities in this area should be
kept covert, secret, especially with respect to activities in
Central America and neighboring countries, third country support?
   NORTH: Yes. Specifically, the first one, on third country,
particularly the financial support ... I was told never to reveal
that to anybody. ... The people I was dealing with ... were high
level officials in those governments. They had political opponents
in their own governments, and they had people trying to kill them,
from the communist side.
   SULLIVAN: Now, sir, focusing on the time period in which you are
involved with these four aspects of work to support the freedom
fighters, did you have an operational account which you used in the
NSC?
   NORTH: Yes. ... I got approval from Mr. McFarlane in person, to
set up a fund that I could dispense to support resistance leaders
when they came to the United States. ...eventually, that was
broadened to include a hostage recovery initiative, and it was to
remain very secret. ...
   SULLIVAN: And over the course of running this special mission
for hostage release, would you have expended several tens of
thousands of dollars out of the operational fund?
   NORTH: Certainly that, yes, sir. ...
   SULLIVAN: Colonel North, approximately how many people over the
years would you have paid out of the operational fund that you
maintained in the office?
   NORTH: ... the total number of people that _ who had _ I don't
want to use the word paid because that isn't accurate, who had
their expenses reimbursed or who were paid would probably be in
excess of 40 people. ...
   SULLIVAN: Did you yourself have reimbursements of expenses out
of these funds?
   NORTH: Yes, sir, I did.
   SULLIVAN: Would you explain to the jury how that worked?
   NORTH: ... There were times when I would do things that it was
not either appropriate or timely or secret to bill it back through
the government. ... The traveler's checks that I signed and that
I've been charged with were _ When I wrote those traveler's checks
that was my money. It was my money because I had reimbursed myself
for expenses I had out of my own pocket.

<HEAD>INS Proposes Halting Hearings for Aliens Denied Asylum at Borders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aliens denied political asylum at the border
could be summarily excluded from the country without a formal
hearing under a proposal being studied in the Justice Department.
   The legislative proposal drafted by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service would eliminate the complicated series of
administrative hearings that aliens are afforded if they are denied
political asylum by the INS.
   Under the proposal, which an official stressed was ``in the
early stage of review,'' a specially trained INS officer would hold
an informal hearing to consider an alien's claim for political
asylum.
   The alien could be excluded from the country without being given
an opportunity to press the political asylum claim before an INS
district director or an immigration judge.
   The proposal being circulated in the Justice Department would
``provide for summary exclusion of aliens who seek asylum at ports
of entry who fail to make a credible showing'' of eligibility,
according to an internal analysis of the plan.
   ``This should discourage those who are claiming asylum, but in
fact have no legitimate right to this status, from attempting to
enter the United States under this claim,'' according to the
document.
   ``This would be a very serious attack on asylum,'' said Arthur
C. Helton, director of the political asylum project of the
non-profit Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in New York City. ``I
think this would obliterate fairness and due process for most
asylum seekers.''
   Such a proposal would ``affect thousands of people arriving at
the border'' each year seeking political asylum from persecution in
their homelands, he said Thursday.
   To qualify for asylum, aliens must demonstrate a ``well-founded
fear of persecution'' in their homeland or show evidence of past
persecution.
   INS contends that the lengthy hearing and appeal process in the
law is abused by aliens who don't have valid claims.
   Congress would have to approve any change in immigration law
that is ultimately proposed by the Justice Department.
   The INS proposal was drafted in the wake of problems in south
Texas, where as many as 5,000 Central Americans a month have sought
asylum since last June.
   Most were denied asylum and more than 4,000 are being detained
in INS facilities in Texas awaiting the outcome of hearings on
their claims of political persecution.
   Most of the refugees have been found ineligible for political
asylum on the ground they are seeking to enter the country to
escape poverty rather than persecution. A quest for economic
opportunity is not a basis for political asylum.
   Gregory J. Leo, director of legislative affairs for INS, said
the proposal was in an ``early stage of review.''
   ``It has received no clearance at any level,'' he said. ``It is
more or less a place to start the discussion.''
   It was drafted as a possible solution to the ``misuse or abuse
of the asylum process,'' Leo said. ``There are people who would use
the asylum process as a means of staying here even though they are
not qualified.''
   Under the draft proposal, the INS examiner's decision would be
final, unless the attorney general or the INS commissioner decided
to admit the alien.
   ``The present system allows an alien to make successive
applications to the district (INS) director and to an immigration
judge, leading to a time-consuming process,'' the department's
analysis says.
   If the immigration judge rules against an alien, the decision
may be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals and then to
federal circuit courts of appeals.
   The existing procedure could enable an alien to remain in this
country for months, perhaps several years before being denied
asylum status.
   In the 1988 fiscal year, 60,000 people sought asylum and if
current rates continue the total for the current year will be more
than 100,000, Helton said.
   Another provision of the INS plan would increase by 5,000 the
number of refugee visas that could be granted to Central Americans
in the current fiscal year. The current limit for the fiscal year
is 3,500.
   This feature is designed to encourage Central Americans to apply
for refugee status at U.S. embassies in the region.
   People seeking refugee status must make their applications
overseas at U.S. embassies or consulates. An alien must be in this
country to seek political asylum.
   The proposal would also abolish the right of an alien to be
represented by an attorney when pressing an asylum claim. Such a
right exists now in immigration court. But at the informal hearing,
attorneys could only advise their clients, not present evidence or
speak on their behalf.
   The INS plan would also sharply limit the opportunities for
aliens to apply for asylum. Aliens would generally be required to
file a notice within two weeks of being placed in deportation
proceedings of their intention to seek asylum. The application
would be due in another 30 days.
   Asylum applications can now be filed virtually at any time
during a deportation proceeding.

   You are instructed that the United States has admitted for
purposes of this trial the following facts to be true:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>(Israel)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   1. In 1983, DCI (Director of Central Intelligence) Casey asked
Secretary of Defense Weinberger if the Department of Defense could
obtain infantry weapons that Israel had confiscated from PLO
forces. Following discussions between Major General Meron of Israel
and Retired Major General Richard Secord of the United States
government, Israel secretly provided several hundred tons of
weapons to the DoD on a grant basis in May 1983. This was known as
Operation ``Tipped Kettle.'' In February 1984, the CIA again asked
DoD if it could obtain additional PLO weapons from Israel at little
or no cost for CIA operational use. After negotiations between
March 1984 and July 1984, Israel secretly provided the additional
weapons to DoD in Operation ``Tipped Kettle II.'' The DoD then
transferred the weapons to the CIA. Although CIA advised Congress
that the weapons would be used for various purposes, in fact many
of them were provided to the Nicaraguan resistance as appropriated
funds ran out.
   The effort to funnel materiel to the Contras at a time when
there were limits on the amount of funds the USG could spend to
support the resistance also found expression in 1984 in Project
``Elephant Herd,'' under which the CIA was to stockpile weapons and
materiel provided by DoD at the lowest possible cost under the
Economy Act. ...

<TEXT>
   2. In late March 1984, National Security Adviser Robert C.
McFarlane suggested that he pursue funding alternatives for the
(Nicaraguan) resistance for use after congressional funding ran
out. ...
   4. In early 1984, in a discussion with the ambassador from Saudi
Arabia, McFarlane encouraged that country to support the
resistance. A short time later, the ambassador informed McFarlane
that his government would contribute $1 million per month. The
money became available during the early summer of 1984.
   5. On June 25, 1984, the National Security Planning Group
(``NSPG'') _ including President Reagan, Vice President Bush,
Secretary of State Shultz, Secretary of Defense Weinberger, DCI
(Director of Central Intelligence) Casey, U.N. Ambassador
Kirkpatrick, CJCS (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) Vessey,
Admiral Moreau, Counselor to the President Meese, McFarlane and
Admiral Poindexter (among others) _ discussed third country funding
for the resistance. ...
   7. At a meeting in mid-July 1984 between DCI Casey, Deputy DCI
John McMahon and Deputy Secretary of State Dam, Casey indicated
that those present ought to get moving on non-USG (U.S. government)
funding for the resistance since Attorney General Smith had
recently concluded that raising the funds in this manner would not
be an impeachable offense, as had been suggested at the NSPG
meeting on June 25, 1984. ...
   16. In early 1985, President Reagan urged the head of state of
Saudi Arabia to continue its support for the resistance. Saudi
Arabia subsequently made a contribution of more than $25 million.
...
   20. In mid-April 1985, Lt. Col. North advised McFarlane that the
resistance had received a total of $24.5 million since appropriated
funds had run out, of which more than $17 million had gone for
arms, munitions, combat operations, and combat support activities.
...
   22. In early August 1985, the White House and various CIA
stations learned of reports that, during the visit of David Kimche
to the U.S. in May 1985, he had met with Michael Armacost, the U.S.
undersecretary for political affairs, and had negotiated the
continuation of military aid from Israel to Central America. ...
   32. In mid-May 1986, Donald Fortier, the director of
political-military affairs at the NSC, was advised that the
situation for the resistance was bleak. President Reagan needed to
pursue means of obtaining additional aid promptly, including
talking personally to heads of state to tell them that he was
dispatching a special emissary with his personal request for their
assistance to the resistance. ...

<TEXT>
   42. In early July 1984, a CIA officer reported to CIA
headquarters that Honduras was taking the position that it would
continue to support the resistance following the U.S. funding
cutoff, but resistance operations would have to be covert to avoid
political embarrassment to Honduras.
   43. In mid-August 1984, Poindexter discussed with President
Reagan and others a proposal ascribed to Secretary Shultz that
would permit Congress to ``wink'' at lethal support for the
resistance. Under Shultz's plan, the U.S. government would supply
non-lethal aid directly to the resistance. The U.S. government
would provide military aid to El Salvador, which in turn would
provide lethal aid to the Resistance. ...
   53. On February 19, 1985, McFarlane sent a memorandum to
President Reagan informing him of the recommendation of the CPPG
(Crisis Pre-Planning Group) to provide incentives to Honduras so
that it would maintain its aid to the resistance. ... It further
recommended a presidential letter to the leader of Honduras, to be
delivered by an emissary who would very privately explain U.S.
criteria for the expedited economic support, security assistance
deliveries, and other support. President Reagan personally
authorized the entire plan.
   54. Later in February 1985, President Reagan sent the
agreed-upon message to (Honduran President) Suazo via the U.S.
ambassador. The letter urged that Honduras do all in its power to
support ``those who struggle for freedom and democracy.'' Shortly
thereafter, McFarlane sent a memorandum to Shultz, Weinberger,
Casey, and Vessey informing them that President Reagan's letter had
been sent and proposing steps to be taken to implement the
president's intent. The memorandum requested DoD (Department of
Defense) to commence expedited delivery of military items, as
previously planned and personally authorized by President Reagan,
and it requested necessary documentation to enhance other support
programs in Honduras. ...
   58. When Vice President Bush met with President Suazo, Bush told
Suazo that President Reagan had directed expedited delivery of U.S.
military items to Honduras. Vice President Bush also informed Suazo
that President Reagan had directed that currently withheld economic
assistance for Honduras should be released; that the United States
would provide from its own military stocks critical security
assistance items that had been ordered by Honduran armed forces,
and that several security programs under way for Honduran security
forces would be enhanced. ...

   A House subcommittee's vote to authorize
construction of the $4.6 billion super collider marks an important
first step toward starting the massive physics project, and already
several lawmakers promise the rest of the way won't be smooth.
   The House subcommittee on energy and research development voted
Thursday to spend $250 million on the Texas-based project in next
year's budget.
   But panel chairwoman Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn., said the full
Committee on Science, Space and Technology must still approve the
project.
   Ms. Lloyd's subcommittee approved the Energy Department's energy
research and development budget with no debate on the collider,
agreeing with President Bush's request for $160 million for initial
construction of the project and $90 million for research and
development.
   Financing the super collider at the $250 million level, however,
means deep cuts will have to be made in other energy research
projects, said Rep. Harris W. Fawell, R-Ill., and the shape of
those reductions will influence his support of the superconducting
super collider.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., issued a statement saying he and
Rep. Paul B. Henry, R-Mich., had reservations about the site
selection process and the magnitude of the project.
   In their joint statement, the Michigan congressmen said they
believe ``that the magnitude of contemplated national expenditure,
combined with unresolved questions of procedure and substance on
the site selection process, demands further review before
recommending authorization for continued work on the project.''
   The men said they were concerned cost estimates on building the
collider have ``escalated dramatically since our last consideration
of the issue.''
   Scientists hope the 53-mile underground tunnel will help them
understand more about the fundamental nature of matter.
   Because of such unresolved questions as whether the DOE made its
preliminary choice of Texas for the project before the receipt of
data from finalist states, ``it is therefore impossible to come to
the final conclusion as to the appropriateness of the site
selection procedure,'' the two Michigan congressmen said.

   62. On April 25, 1985, McFarlane informed President Reagan that
military support for the resistance from Honduras was in jeopardy
as a consequence of the House vote refusing to provide new funds
for the resistance. The Honduran military had stopped a shipment of
ammunition from an Asian country en route to the resistance after
it had arrived in Honduras. McFarlane recommended that President
Reagan call President Suazo to make clear that the executive branch
was determined to maintain pressure on the Sandinistas. During the
call between the two leaders, Suazo urged that the U.S. government
continue to oppose communism. President Reagan's personal notes of
his telephone call reflect that President Suazo told President
Reagan that the Honduras military commander would be ordered to
deliver the ammunition to the resistance. President Reagan pledged
his continued support for the resistance; President Suazo raised
the subject of U.S. government aid for his country. ...
   64. In May 1985, President Reagan personally approved increased
U.S. special support to Honduras and Guatemala for joint programs
with those countries.
   72. In mid-December 1985, Lt. Col. North and Admiral Poindexter
visited Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, and Honduras to
urge those countries to provide continued support for the armed
resistance.
   74. On December 20, 1985, Admiral Poindexter discussed with
President Reagan the provision of U.S. arms to Honduras.
   78. In mid-January 1986, Lt. Col. North prepared talking points
for a meeting between Admiral Poindexter, Vice President Bush, and
Honduran President Azcona. North recommended that Admiral
Poindexter and Vice President Bush tell President Azcona of the
need for Honduras to work with the U.S. government on increasing
regional involvement with and support for the resistance.
   79. In mid-January 1986, the State Department prepared a
memorandum for Donald Gregg (the vice president's national security
adviser) for Vice President Bush's meeting with President Azcona.
According to DoS, one purpose of the meeting was to encourage
continued Honduran support for the resistance. The memorandum
alerted Gregg that Azcona would insist on receiving clear economic
and social benefits from its cooperation with the United States. ...

   97. In late August 1986, North reported to Admiral Poindexter
that a representative of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega had asked
North to meet with him. Noriega's representative proposed that, in
exchange for a promise from the USG to help clean up Noriega's
image and a commitment to lift the USG ban on military sales to the
Panamanian defense forces, Noriega would assassinate the Sandinista
leadership for the U.S. government. North had told Noriega's
representative that U.S. law forbade such actions. The
representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place
in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things, just as
Noriega had helped the USG the previous year in blowing up a
Sandinista arsenal. ...
   98. North advised Admiral Poindexter that the British persons
who had run the operation against the arsenal had used a Panamanian
civilian ordnance expert. North noted that Noriega had the
capabilities that he had proffered, and that the cost of any
operations could be borne by Project Democracy.
   99. Admiral Poindexter responded that if Noriega had assets
inside Nicaragua, he could be helpful. The USG could not be
involved in assassination, but Panamanian assistance with sabotage
would be another story. Admiral Poindexter recommended that North
speak with Noriega directly. ...
   106. In late September 1986, Lt. Col. North reported to Admiral
Poindexter on his London meeting with Noriega. Noriega would try to
take immediate actions against the Sandinistas and offered a list
of priorities including an oil refinery, an airport, and the Puerto
Sandino off-load facility.

the existene of the Santa Elena airstrip. North stated that
President Arias of Costa Rica had breached his understanding with
the U.S. government. Assistant Secretary of State Abrams and
Secretary of State Shultz wanted to cancel Arias' scheduled visit
with President Reagan and replace his appointment by scheduling a
meeting with President Cerezo of Guatemala. Admiral Poindexter
agreed. ...
   107. At the end of September 1986, Lt. Col. North reemphasized
to Admiral Poindexter that President Arias of Costa Rica should not
be invited to meet President Reagan in light of Arias' disclosure
of the Santa Elena airstrip. North recommended that Presidents
Duarte and Cerezo be invited to meet President Reagan instead,
because El Salvador and Guatemala had supported the resistance.

<HEAD>Former NATO Commander Calls for 50 Percent Troop Reduction in Alliance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former NATO commander wants to reduce the
alliance's active conventional forces by 50 percent, with the
Warsaw Pact cutting its strength to the same number of troops.
   Calling NATO's current proposal only a starting point for
negotiations with the Warsaw Pact nations, retired Army Gen. Andrew
J. Goodpaster on Thursday told the Senate Armed Services Committee
his plan amounts to a ``radical restructuring'' on both sides.
   The current NATO proposal calls for a 5 percent to 10 percent
cut in battle tanks, heavy artillery and armored troop carriers.
The offer came in response to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
proposal last December to cut the Red Army by 10 percent with a
reduction of 5,000 tanks and 50,000 troops in Eastern Europe.
   ``I do not think the interests of the West would be served if
that's as far as we went,'' said Goodpaster, who served as supreme
Allied commander in Europe from 1968 to 1969.
   Goodpaster, 74, said his proposal calls for ``parity, with total
active forces on each side at no more than 50 percent of present
NATO strength.''
   The proposal surprised the members of the Senate Armed Services
panel with Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., interrupting Goodpaster's
testimony to clarify what the retired general had suggested.
   ``Do you think it's a mistake to focus in isolation on the
current NATO proposal?'' Nunn asked.
   ``I do indeed,'' responded Goodpaster, the onetime aide to
former President Eisenhower who helped him organize NATO's military
arm in the early 1950s.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the
committee, described Goodpaster's proposal as ``history in the
making, a bold initiative.'' Nunn called the plan a ``bold
proposal.''
   After the hearing, Nunn said Goodpaster's plan, coming from a
``stalwart supporter of the alliance,'' would cause a considerable
stir.
   Goodpaster is telling NATO officials, ``Get your thinking caps
on,'' Nunn said.
   Goodpaster is chairman of The Atlantic Council of the United
States, a NATO support group.
   The panel also heard from Phillip A. Karber, a defense
consultant with a subsidiary of the Ford Aerospace Co., who argued
against 50 percent reductions in NATO forces, and Stan Sloan, a
former CIA analyst on NATO affairs who serves as a senior
specialist in international security.
   Sloan told the committee that French officials had expressed
concerns about NATO's proposed cuts and favored unilateral
reductions if there had to be any agreement.
   Meanwhile, House Armed Services Chairman, Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., said NATO should accept the Warsaw Pact's offer and stop
refusing to include aircraft in the first round of negotiations.
   ``We should take a leaf from Mikhail Gorbachev's book and accept
our opponent's first offer,'' Aspin told an audience in the Hague,
Netherlands. ``It would do us more good militarily and politically
than if we prevailed with NATO's go-slow position.''
   Aspin has criticized NATO's position since negotiations began
last month in Vienna between Moscow and the Warsaw Pact nations and
NATO.

   Oliver North's decision to testify in his
trial also means he must turn over his notebooks, which prosecutors
may use to prove North shredded documents during the Iran-Contra
affair.
   ``We are prepared to produce'' the notebooks, North attorney
Barry Simon said toward the close of Thursday's court session. The
notebooks cover the period from October 1984 to Nov. 25, 1986, the
day North was fired from the National Security Council.
   North's decision to take the stand takes away any privilege he
may have to refuse to produce documents in his possession.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell had ruled earlier in the
North trial that he didn't have to surrender his notebooks, based
on his constitutional right against self-incrimination.
   At a hearing Jan. 25, Simon suggested that prosecutors might try
to use the notebooks in the portion of the case alleging
destruction of documents by North in November 1986 as the
Iran-Contra affair was unfolding.
   In arguing against production of the notebooks, Simon said
prosecutors might try to link references in the notebooks to
documents that North allegedly destroyed before leaving the NSC.
   North made daily entries in the spiral-bound notebooks while he
worked at the National Security Council. The office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh obtained a subpoena for them March 3 and now
wants that subpoena enforced.
   Simon wants to limit the use of the notebooks to those entries
around the time periods of the alleged crimes North is accused of
committing. Gesell said some of the entries may be classified
material and should be censored.
   The judge said he would issue an order today addressing those
questions.
   Portions of the notebooks that were turned over earlier to
Congress and have been made public contain a wealth of information.
   One charge against North is that he obstructed Congress by
helping prepare a false chronology that said no U.S. official
learned before January 1986 that Hawk missiles had been shipped to
Iran in November 1985.
   The notebooks show North's participation in helping arrange the
shipment.
   In notebook entries for Nov. 20, 1985, North detailed a plan for
transporting the Hawks to Iran in exchange for a four-phase release
of hostages. Several days later, the shipment was made aboard a
CIA-controlled airline.
   North's notebooks confirm Contra leader Adolfo Calero consulted
with him on weapons needs and purchases.
   North's notebooks describe successful efforts in obtaining false
certificates from Guatemalan officials stating that arms which were
in fact destined for the Contras were for the exclusive use of the
Central American country to which they were being sent. The false
certificates enabled one of North's co-defendants, Richard Secord,
to ship more than 90,000 pounds of East European munitions by
chartered aircraft from a European arms dealer to the Contras.

   A dissident publisher accused of printing
seditious articles burned to death in his office today after
firebombs he hurled at police sparked a 90-minute blaze in the
building, police said.
   Taipei Police Chief Wang Chun said Cheng Nan-rong, publisher of
opposition Freedom Era magazine, tossed the firebombs from his
third-floor office at riot police who had come to arrest him for
printing articles that advocated an independent Taiwan.
   At least 12 policemen were injured, some with serious burns,
Wang said. Police said several residents in the seven-story
building were also injured by the fire.
   Wang said Cheng, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party,
the main opposition to the ruling Nationalist Party, was found dead
in the office after firemen extinguished the blaze.
   About 400 police cordoned off the building, and witnesses said
eight staffers of the magazine were arrested.
   Chen Yao-nan, a prosecutor at the Taiwan High Court, said he
issued a warrant for Cheng's arrest Thursday after the publisher
had twice refused to appear for a court hearing on sedition
allegations. Cheng could have been sentenced to death if convicted
of sedition.
   In addition to advocating independence for Taiwan, Cheng also
had published articles that called for a new constitution for this
island, officials said.
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war in China, continue to maintain they are the legitimate
government of all China and that Taiwan is a Chinese province.
   Both Taiwan and China are opposed to an independent Taiwan, and
China has indicated it would use force to prevent the establishment
of an independent Taiwan.

<HEAD>Document Says Noriega Offered To Sabotage Targets in Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega met
with Oliver North in 1986 and offered to sabotage Nicaraguan
targets including an airport and oil refineries, according to
evidence presented at North's trial.
   The information is contained in a U.S. government ``admission of
facts'' focusing on the Reagan administration's secret assistance
to the Contra rebels at a time when Congress had cut off military
aid to the rebel force.
   In late September 1986, North reported to his boss,
then-national security adviser John Poindexter ``on his London
meeting with Noriega,'' said a portion of the 42-page admission.
   ``Noriega would try to take immediate actions against the
Sandinistas and offered a list of priorities including an oil
refinery, an airport and the Puerto Sandino off-load facility,''
said the admission.
   In late August, according to the admission, North told
Poindexter that a representative of Noriega had said the Panamanian
leader ``would assassinate the Sandinista leadership for the U.S.
government.''
   A Panamanian military spokesman on Thursday denied the
allegations. Maj. Edgardo Lopez called them ``another cock-and-bull
story of the United States to continue strangling the Panamanian
people and intensify its defamation campaign against the chief of
our Defense Forces.''
   According to the court document, the assassination offer came
``in exchange for a promise from the USG (U.S. government) to help
clean up Noriega's image and a commitment to lift the USG ban on
military sales to the Panamanian defense forces.''
   North told the representative that ``U.S. law forbade''
assassinations of foreign leaders and the representative responded
by saying Noriega ``could accomplish many essential things.''
   Noriega, said the representative, ``had helped the USG the
previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal,'' said the
admission of facts.
   British individuals who had run the operation against the
arsenal had used a Panamanian civilian ordnance expert, North told
Poindexter, according to the admission.
   North told Poindexter that the cost of any operations ``could be
borne by Project Democracy,'' the covert private aid network that
North had set up with Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, now
co-defendants in the Iran-Contra case.
   Poindexter responded that if Noriega had assets in Nicaragua, he
could be helpful. The national security adviser also said that the
U.S. government could not be involved in assassination, but
Panamanian assistance with sabotage ``would be another story,''
according to the admission.
   Both the prosecution and North's lawyers have agreed to the
wording in the admission of facts. The document was assembled to
avoid a protracted legal battle over classified information which
North's lawyers want to present in his defense.
   The admission is a summary of highly sensitive classified
material which the government refuses to allow into the courtroom.

<HEAD>Strike By Tribal Separatists Leaves 16 Dead, 35 Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 10-day strike called by tribal
militants demanding autonomy in the northeastern state of Assam has
left at least 16 people dead and 35 injured, according to news
reports.
   Since the strike began March 27, there have been 25 cases of
arson, 31 attacks on police patrols and 25 bombings, United News of
India said Thursday.
   The agency said disrupted transportation services had cost the
government nearly $1.5 million in lost freight charges.
   Passenger rail services in the region, about 1,000 miles east of
New Delhi, resumed Thursday after a 10-day suspension.
   Those killed in the violence included an army doctor and four
police officers, United News said. The agency said 25 police
officers were injured in bomb blasts and ambushes.
   The Bodo tribespeople are demanding a separate homeland on the
northern bank of the Brahmaputra River in Assam, a remote, hilly
state bordering Bangladesh and Bhutan.
   The proposed Bodoland would cover about one-third of Assam's
territory of 24,512 square miles, most of which is prime forest and
cultivable land.
   The Bodos, mostly farmers, were animists before they converted
to Hinduism and Christianity earlier this century. They make up
about 30 percent of Assam's 20 million people.
   The government has refused to consider their demand for a
separate state. Bodos say that migration to their traditional
homelands by non-tribal people has reduced farm sizes, causing
economic and social turmoil.
   Migration has been an issue for more than 20 years, but there
were few reports of violence until about two years ago.
   Bodo militants have called for more strikes. The next one is set
for April 18 and is to last for 20 days.
   According to government figures, at least 114 people have been
killed in separatist violence since February.
   Most of the victims have been non-tribal villagers in the
Bodo-dominated Kokrajhar and Udalgiri districts of Assam.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grows By $4.22 Billion in February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers took out $4.22 billion more in debt
than they paid off in February in the latest sign that the American
economy may be slowing down.
   The Federal Reserve Board report Thursday was the slowest pace
of growth for the consumer debt in four months, down from the $4.37
billion rise in January and the smallest monthly gain since
October's $3.91 billion increase.
   Analysts said the restrained growth in debt indicates consumers
may be becoming more cautious about their buying plans and is in
line with other signs that the economy is slowing down in the
seventh year of its record peacetime expansion.
   ``It doesn't suggest any great retrenchment by consumers but it
does indicate somewhat more caution,'' said economist Cynthia Latta
of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``It's consistent with
this gradually accumulating evidence that the economy is beginning
to cool off.''
   The gain in auto loans was slightly smaller than in January,
rising $2.1 billion in February after a $2.13 billion increase the
month before.

   Two Democrats are trying to mandate
presidential debates for candidates seeking government campaign
dollars.
   ``If presidential candidates are going to continue to take $100
million from taxpayers to run their campaigns, then there ought to
be some assurance that they will stand up on stage, face their
opponent and engage in a true discussion of the issues,'' said Rep.
Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.
   Markey and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., introduced legislation
Thursday that would require candidates who are eligible to receive
public funds in the general election campaign to agree in writing
to participate in at least four 90-minute debates. The vice
presidential nominees would be required to engage in at least one
debate.
   Under the proposal, the debates would be sponsored by
non-partisan organizations and held in September and October. At
least 30 minutes of each 90-minute debate would be devoted to
questions and answers or candidate-to-candidate exchanges.
   The Federal Election Commission would determine whether
candidates are responsible for failing to comply.

Justice Department delay any plans to abolish the Organized Crime
Strike Force Program.
   ``We believe that a decision to abolish the strike forces could
hamper federal law enforcement capabilities at a time when many
areas are overwhelmed with organized crime and illegal drug
activity,'' the senators said in a letter to Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   The letter _ signed by Democrats Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts and Sam Nunn of Georgia and Republicans Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania _ was
delivered to the Justice Department on Thursday.
   A Justice Department spokesman said Thornburgh ``has said he was
leaning in favor of merging those offices into the U.S. attorneys'
offices.''

<HEAD>U.N. Experts Say Soviets Ready To Allow Appeals On Human Rights</HEAD>

   Two human rights experts affiliated with
the United Nations say Moscow is ready to sign an accord allowing
Soviet citizens to take complaints of rights abuses directly to
international investigators.
   Soviets would be able to bring cases against their government
involving allegations of torture, inhumane or degrading treatment;
forced labor; arbitrary arrest or detention; and restrictions on
emigration, among other abuses.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the General Assembly in
December that human rights should be given new emphasis in
international affairs, and this would be in line with that policy.
   The Soviet Union intends to sign the Optional Protocol to the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, rights
officials said Thursday.
   Rajsoomer Lallah of Mauritius, chairman of the Human Rights
Committee, and Fausto Pocar of Italy, another committee officer,
told reporters the notice was unofficial and the Soviets had not
specified when the protocol will be signed.
   Their committee is an international body of U.N.-affiliated
legal experts with the power to order compensation.
   Pocar said he received the Soviet assurances while in Moscow in
November.
   Lallah said he also received unofficial confirmation from
Moscow, and noted, ``In October, we are going to examine the third
periodic (human rights) report of the U.S.S.R., and it is possible
that by then the decision will have been taken, or in process of
being taken.''
   The Soviet Union said last month it would accept World Court
jurisdiction in cases brought under the Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and five other human rights treaties.
   The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
guarantees the individual's right to life; freedom from torture,
inhuman or degrading treatment; freedom from slavery, forced labor;
freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention; freedom of movement;
freedom of thought, conscience, peaceful assembly, and free
association, among other provisions.
   However, individuals do not have the right to approach the World
Court with allegations of rights violations, only governments.
   By signing the Optional Protocol, Moscow will be granting its
citizens the right to appeal directly to the Human Rights Committee.
   Hungary ratified the protocol last year, joining 40 other
nations that recognize it.
   Pocar and Lallah are two of the 18 human rights experts who
conclude a three-week session of the Human Rights Committee today.
The experts examined human rights reports filed by Uruguay, the
Philippines, Togo and New Zealand.
   Soviet acceptance of outside scrutiny of its human rights
practices should help Moscow's campaign to be host city for a human
rights conference in 1991.
   In January, Washington changed its position and said it would
accept a Moscow conference, citing the Soviet release of political
prisoners, easing of emigration and more tolerant views on free
speech and freedom of religion.

   By plane from the West and train and bus from the East, tens of
thousands of pro-choice activists will converge on the nation's
capital for a march Sunday aimed at keeping abortion legal.
   ``The silent majority is mobilizing,'' said Betty Crowe,
president of Planned Parenthood of Central Indiana, at a news
conference Thursday in Indianapolis.
   About 200 Indiana residents will leave Saturday on buses bound
for Washington to join pro-choice activists from around the
country. Organizers are reluctant to predict the size of the
demonstration, but they expect it will be far larger than a March
1986 rally of about 90,000 in the capital.
   ``One thing I've noticed from going to the march two years ago _
the feeling is very different this time,'' said Janet Callum,
director of administrative services at the Feminist Women's Health
Center in Atlanta.
   ``Two years ago, it wasn't as urgent a situation. Now, people
feel we need to show the Supreme Court and the president and the
elected representatives that the majority of the people in this
country are pro-choice,'' she said.
   The march comes a few weeks in advance of oral arguments
scheduled before the U.S. Supreme Court on a Missouri case that
could reverse or severely limit the high court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion.
   The march also follows a demonstration by 65,000
anti-abortionists at the White House in January. President Bush has
continued the Reagan administration's push to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
   Among the pro-choice activists going to Washington will be a
plane load of celebrities from Los Angeles, including Donna Mills
and Morgan Fairchild. Other Hollywood stars who plan to attend are
Glenn Close, Kelly McGillis, Cybill Shepherd, Susan Sarandon, Marlo
Thomas, Polly Bergen, Ellen Burstyn, Teri Garr, Veronica Hamel and
Valerie Harper.
   The celebrities plan to have breakfast with members of Congress
on Sunday before joining the march.
   About 25,000 New Yorkers are expected at the rally, including
10,000 from New York City, organizers said.
   ``I do believe the sheer size of it will provide an impact and
send an important message ... that a majority of people in this
country are pro choice,'' said Mimi Grinker, a spokesman for
Planned Parenthood of New York City.
   Planned Parenthood in New York City has chartered a plane, a
train and 10 buses to carry demonstrators to Washington. The New
York City chapter of National Organization for Women has chartered
160 buses.
   About 2,500 people are expected to board more than 50 buses in
Boston for the march.
   ``We want to participate in showing ... the pro-choice position
is supported by mainstream Americans, men and women from all walks
of life,'' said Boston YWCA President Tyra B. Sidberry.
   Win Johnson, march organizer with the Minnesota Pro-Choice
Coalition, said at least 1,000 people from Minnesota are traveling
by bus, plane and train to the demonstration.
   ``Pro-choice people have been silent too long. We need to come
out of the closet and into the streets. We've played nice girl too
long,'' she said.

   The U.S. dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Friday, while share prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar ended trading at 132.08 yen, down 0.07 yen from
Thursday's close of 132.15 yen. It opened at 132.10 yen and stayed
in a tight range of 132.07 yen to 132.15 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
365.01 points Thursday, the second largest decline this year,
recouped 189.27 points, or 0.57 percent, closing at 33,185.05.
   Currency traders said trading was quiet as market participants
awaited the release of U.S. jobless figures for March, due out
later Friday.
   But there was demand for the dollar in the Tokyo market, mainly
because of higher U.S. interest rates and recent political
uncertainties in Japan, said one trader at a commercial bank in
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The higher U.S. interest rates make the dollar more attractive
for foreign investors.
   Market participants, however, also were concerned about possible
Bank of Japan intervention if the dollar rises above 133 yen,
traders said.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the market's key index rose
as speculative investors bought issues that became cheaper in
Thursday's plunge.
   Individuals actively bought issues such as chemical and
construction shares, while institutional investors hesitated to
make major moves amid political uncertainties and the release of
the U.S. unemployment figures, said one dealer with a major
securities firm in Tokyo.
   Opposition parties have been demanding the resignation of Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita and his Cabinet because of politicians'
links to a widening stock-profiteering scandal.
   It was disclosed this week that Takeshita received $380,000 in
contributions to 1987 fund-raising parties from Recruit Co., a
services conglomerate that offered bargain-price unlisted shares in
its real estate subsidiary to some 160 influential political and
business figures.
   Prosecutors have arrested 14 people on bribery and securities
law violation charges, and three Cabinet members have resigned in
connection with the scandal. In public opinion polls, support for
Takeshita has dropped as low as 9 percent.

   The third of five otters pulled from the
Alaskan oil spill has died, too weakened from ingesting crude oil
to respond to treatment at Sea World, a spokesman for the marine
park said.
   Blood samples from the remaining two otters were being analyzed
to determine if they were responding to efforts to draw the toxins
from their blood, said park spokesman Dan LeBlanc.
   ``Whether the animals are healthy enough to be stabilized
remains to be seen,'' LeBlanc said. ``We feel that if we had
started this early on, even in the field, we might have had a shot
at saving them.''
   One of otters died Tuesday; a second died Wednesday; the third
on Thursday.
   Tests showed that ingested oil apparently caused liver and
kidney damage in the otters, caught with other wildlife in the
10-million gallon oil spill from the Exxon tanker Valdez, which ran
aground March 24 in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   The nation's worst oil spill has killed thousands of animals and
has resulted in millions of dollars in losses to fishermen. The
spill now covers more than 2,600 square miles.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife
worked the crowds of London, kissing some schoolchildren and
shaking a sea of outstretched hands.
   Gorbachev visited a high-tech factory, asked workers about the
size of their paychecks and made an impromptu stop on a London
street.
   His wife, Raisa, went to school and visited a church, gave
chocolates to a child and viewed a museum exhibit about Karl Marx.
   At each stop, they left behind grinning crowds and good feelings.
   ``I was the first person to shake his hand,'' said Tim Haggarty
of Londonderry, Northern Ireland, after Gorbachev hopped from a
limousine outside Westminister Abbey to chat with cheering
onlookers.
   He called Gorbachev ``a hero,'' saying, ``This is the best day
in my entire life.''
   Gorbachev also visited a factory Thursday, asking surprised
workers not only about quality control but whether they were happy.
   ``He even asked me my salary, which was a bit embarrassing
because I think us English like to keep our salaries to
ourselves,'' said Michael Smith, a 43-year-old worker at the Case
Communications Ltd. plant 18 miles northwest of London.
   The factory produces systems that enable computers to talk to
each other. The company said the Soviets invited themselves last
week because Gorbachev would be interested in its technology.
   Gorbachev spoke with particular friendliness to Smith, a senior
designer of printed circuit boards.
   ``He was a very friendly chap, I thought,'' Smith said.
   ``He was more interested in my private life. He asked where I
was educated, what sort of school I went to, where I lived, what
size of house I had. He wanted to talk about my family, my wife and
children, where they went to school.''
   Employee Angela Dawkins, 42, told Gorbachev she had worked at
the factory ``for six happy years.''
   Gorbachev fixed her with a stare and said: ``Are you saying this
because the bosses are listening?''
   ``No, I really mean it,'' she said.
   ``Ah yes, I can see from your eyes,'' she said Gorbachev replied.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, meanwhile, did not seem to mind trading the
tropical heat of Cuba, the couple's previous stop on their
three-nation tour, for London's chilly rain.
   ``I feel quite fresh after Havana,'' she told reporters at Tower
Bridge during a five-minute stop at the misty River Thames.
   Visiting Prior Weston primary school, she received a bouquet of
red carnations and urged the children to ``tell your grown-up
brothers and sisters, your parents and your friends, that we spoke
about flowers growing throughout the world.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev sealed this wish with a kiss, leaving 9-year-old
Benjamin Robinson embarrassed and adorned with two red lipstick
marks on his cheeks.
   ``I didn't dislike it. But I didn't like it either,'' Benjamin
said.
   ``You have got a bit of history on your cheek,'' teacher Mary
Caven told him.
   ``Eventually Mum will make me wash it off,'' Benjamin replied.
   Mrs. Gorbachev also toured the Museum of London, where she
watched a few scenes from a Punch and Judy show and saw an exhibit
commemorating Marx, communism's founding father, who lived in
London.
   Mrs. Gorbachev also visited St. Paul's Cathedral, where
4-year-old Emma Scott presented her with flowers. Mrs. Gorbachev
gave her a kiss and presented her with a box of Russian chocolates.
   In Moscow, Soviet media painted a generally glowing picture
Thursday of Gorbachev's first day in London.
   The nightly news program ``Vremya'' devoted more than 20 minutes
to the visit and reported no disagreement with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher beyond Gorbachev's friendly correction of her
estimate of how long they had talked.

   The late Rock Hudson's lover may accept less
than the $21.75 million a jury awarded him in the landmark AIDS
case, his attorney said.
   Marc Christian would be inclined to accept a reduction as long
as it doesn't go below $9 million in actual damages and $3 million
in punitive damages, said his lawyer, Harold Rhoden.
   ``It's important to preserve the message that was sent,'' Rhoden
said, ``and to do that we must preserve the punitive damages.''
   The case was to return to court today in the wake of sexual
accusations and lie detector tests, and Rhoden said he would not be
surprised if Superior Court Judge Bruce Geernaert reduced the award.
   ``I'm going to ask him to let the verdict stand, but I've got to
concede he probably won't,'' Rhoden said Thursday.
   The attorney for the Hudson estate, James Parker Mills, said
Thursday he wants a new trial, citing new evidence from a man who
claims he had sex with Christian after his lawsuit was filed.
   That man, Gunther Fraulob, took a polygraph exam and passed,
Mills said. But Rhoden said Christian, who adamantly denies having
sex with Fraulob, also passed a lie detector test.
   Christian, who won his huge judgment against the Hudson estate
because the actor failed to tell him he had AIDS, contended he was
so traumatized by learning about it that he has remained celibate
ever since. Fraulob said they had sex shortly after Christian filed
his lawsuit in November 1985.
   Neither man's lie detector test is admissible in court.
   Christian, 35, has maintained that he lived in fear of
developing AIDS after learning of Hudson's affliction shortly
before the actor died.
   The jury found that Hudson engaged in ``outrageous conduct'' by
concealing from Christian that he had AIDS. The jurors, who had
heard seven weeks of often lurid testimony about the dead star's
sex life, said in separate verdicts on Feb. 15 and Feb. 17 that
Christian should receive $14.5 million in actual damages and $7.25
million in punitive damages.
   Christian's case is seen as precedent-setting because he did not
develop AIDS and has tested negative for the disease. In previous
lawsuits, only those who contracted a sexually transmitted disease
were able to win damages.
   Hudson's estate and his personal secretary, Mark Miller, were
co-defendants in the civil lawsuir. Only Millers was named in the
second phase, for punitive and exemplary damages, because state law
prohibits such damages being awarded from an estate.
   Compensatory damages are intended to compensate for loss of
income, pain and suffering and actual damages. Punitive damages are
intended to punish, while exemplary damages would set an example
for others.
   Hudson, 58, the handsome leading man in such movies as ``Pillow
Talk'' and ``Giant,'' died on Oct. 5, 1985, three months after the
public learned that he had the disease.

   Leading the 101-member Non-Aligned
Movement in a scathing denunciation of the top U.N. official in
Namibia, black African nations have asked the world body to send
7,500 peacekeepers to the territory.
   They accused the world body Thursday of contributing to the
fighting in Namibia by being ``wholly unprepared to assume its
responsibilities'' of protecting the population and containing
South African forces.
   The Security Council, meanwhile, scheduled private consultations
this afternoon on Namibia.
   Namibian officials say at least 252 guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization have been killed this week in combat,
along with 24 members of the South African-led security forces.
   The violence has threatened the U.N.-sponsored plan for the
territory's independence.
   U.N. investigators in the field have concluded up to 1,000 SWAPO
guerrillas crossed the Angolan border into Namibia last weekend,
sparking bloody reprisals by Namibian territorial police.
   The Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement, a committee
that meets in New York and consists of U.N. diplomats from 101
countries, severely criticized Martti Ahtisaari, the U.N.'s special
representative for Namibia.
   The Non-Aligned nations were ``outraged to note that the murder
squads of Battalion 101 and Koevoet were operating with the full
authority of the Special Representative of the United Nations
secretary-general, Mr. Martti Ahtisaari,'' said a communique from
the group.
   ``The Bureau judged Mr. Ahtisaari's action to be ill-conceived
and a violation of Security Council Resolution 435 (1978),'' the
U.N. plan for Namibia's independence.
   South African troops of Battalion 101 were supposed to be
confined to barracks under U.N. independence transition plans for
Namibia, but they were allowed to reinforce security forces after
fighting broke out.
   Koevoet _ the Afrikaans word for crowbar _ is the name of a
special unit of black Namibian policemen, commanded mainly by white
South African officers.
   ``The Bureau called upon the Secretary-General of the United
Nations to confine the South African forces to their bases without
delay in compliance with Resolution 435 and to effect the immediate
full deployment of the 7,500 military (observer) component of UNTAG
in Namibia ... in order to ensure free and fair elections without
intimidation,'' the statement said.
   ``Furthermore, the Bureau expressed concern at the poor judgment
shown by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in his
handling of the present crisis in Namibia and called on the
Secretary-General to ensure that the same does not happen in
future,'' said the Non-Aligned communique.
   The Security Council authorized 4,650 military observers for
UNTAG, but said it could deploy up to 7,500 soldiers if necessary.
   The Non-Aligned countries called on the United Nations to let
the SWAPO guerrillas battling the Namibian territorial police be
confined to bases in Namibia, on the same basis that 1,500 South
African troops are to be confined to barracks in the country.
   The size and cost of the Namibia operation has been a
contentious issue since December, when the Non-Aligned nations
sought 7,500 peacekeepers at a cost of up to $700 million annually.
   The five permanent Security Council members _ the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain, France and China _ sought a reduced force
that would cost less.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar recommended a
compromise in which 4,650 military observers were dispatched, but
up to 7,500 could be authorized if needed. That plan was budgeted
at $416 million.
   The Non-Aligned nations said that was too few peacekeepers, and
the dispute delayed the dispatch of the force. About 920
peacekeepers are in Namibia.

   Roman Catholic Bishop Donald W. Wuerl has
appointed a committee of four clergymen to evaluate claims that a
figure of Jesus Christ closed its eyes during a Good Friday service
in Ambridge.
   Wuerl said Thursday the committee will study reports by the Rev.
Vincent Cvitkovic, pastor of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church,
and five other people, who said they have evidence that the Jesus
figure changed in appearance.
   The statue appears to have its eyes closed to slits, while
church officials say that before Good Friday they were about
one-third of the way open.
   Thousands of people have visited the church to see the crucifix,
which is 15 feet above the altar.
   The Diocese of Pittsburgh said the reports are accompanied by a
videotape which shows the rehanging of the refurbished crucifix in
January and more videotape taken Good Friday, March 24.
   Committee members are Auxiliary Bishops John B. McDowell and
William J. Winter; the Rev. Lawrence A. DiNardo, diocean
chancellor; and the Rev. Robert L. McCreary, chairman of the
diocean Theological Commission.
   The committee has no deadline for its work.

<HEAD>Dock Strike Looms Over Proposal To Change 42-Year-Old Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it will abolish a 42-year-old
law that guarantees jobs to nearly 10,000 British dockworkers, but
labor leaders say they will paralyze the country's ports with
strikes to block the change.
   Employment Secretary Norman Fowler told the House of Commons on
Thursday that the National Dock Labor Scheme was an anachronism.
   ``As long as the scheme continues to operate, it will remain the
biggest obstacle to a modern and efficient ports industry,'' he
said.
   A total of 1,700 dockworkers immediately walked off the job
Thursday at Tilbury east of London in protest.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative administration,
which has sharply restricted trade union powers, plans to write a
parliamentary bill to abolish the law by July.
   The bill is guaranteed passage through Parliament because of the
Coservative majority in the House of Commons.
   The current law regulates employment conditions in the 46 ports
it covers. It guarantees jobs to 9,400 dockworkers there by
ensuring staff levels can be cut only when workers quit voluntarily.
   Even an employee who loses a job when his or her employer goes
out of business is guaranteed a job with another employer.
   To soften the change, the government has agreed to pay about
$59,500 to each of the 1,000 dockworkers expected to lose their
jobs when the new law goes into effect.
   The 1.3 million-member Transport and General Workers Union
represents most of the 9,400 dockworkers involved. The union's
docks officer, John Connally, predicted a nationwide strike would
be called to protest the scheme.
   Britain has another 29 newer ports that employ 4,000 dockworkers
who are not covered by the National Dock Labor Scheme. But Connally
said he believed they would also walk off the job in sympathy.

<TEXT>
   The Khmer Rouge today denounced
Vietnam's plan to withdraw troops from Cambodia and called instead
for a pullout supervised by the United Nations.
   Resistance leaders also expressed doubt Vietnam would honor its
pledge to remove its remaining 50,000 to 70,000 troops from
Cambodia by Sept. 30.
   Vietnamese troops entered Cambodia in December 1978 and ousted
the communist Khmer Rouge, under whose rule an estimated one-fourth
of Cambodia's 8 million people died from famine and execution since
1975.
   But the clandestine Khmer Rouge radio, in its first public
statement on Vietnam's withdrawal plan, said ``the entire Cambodian
people absolutely cannot accept the announcement of a unilateral
troop pullout of the Hanoi Vietnamese aggressors.''
   The broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, also denounced Vietnam's
proposal that India, Canada and Poland oversee the withdrawal along
with a representative of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   Resistance officials oppose Vietnam's choices for the monitoring
force because of Poland's ties to the Soviet Union and India's
recognition of the Vietnam-backed government in Cambodia.
   ``Without genuine supervision by the United Nations, there would
be no genuine withdrawal of Vietnamese troops,'' the radio said.
   China, the main arms suppliers to the Cambodian resistance, also
has insisted that any monitoring force be established by the United
Nations and not Vietnam.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest of the three groups in the
resistance coalition headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Fears that
the Khmer Rouge would regain power has been a major stumbling block
to a settlement of the political crisis brought on by Vietnam's
military presence.
   On Thursday, Vietnam's official Hanoi Radio reaffirmed that it
would withdraw its troops by Sept. 30 deadline and urged the
international community to prevent the brutal Khmer Rouge regime
from regaining power.
   Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia has been a major stumbling
block to establishing relations with the United States in the wake
of the Vietnam war and improving economic ties with non-communist
Southeast Asian nations.
   China also has refused to resume normal relations with the
Soviet Union as long as Vietnamese troops remain. Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev is to visit China next month for the first
Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   In the statement, the Khmer Rouge accused Hanoi of announcing
the unilateral withdrawal to avoid U.N. supervision so it could
secretly maintain troops in Cambodia.
   The statement, attributed to Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan,
said the move also was aimed at maintaining the pro-Vietnamese
Cambodian administration of Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   Resistance groups have called for disbanding the Phnom Penh
government and establishing a four-party coalition administration
under Sihanouk that would include Hun Sen's followers.
   The Khmer Rouge, in its statement, also called for the
four-party coalition government.
   In a written statement issued Thursday in Beijing, Sihanouk, the
former Cambodian ruler, rejected ``all decisions, all conditions,
and all accords'' announced by Vietnam regarding Cambodia.
   He urged Vietnam to pull out of Cambodia as soon as possible
under supervision of the United Nations, which would supervise new
elections.
   Indonesia, meanwhile, said it would sponsor a meeting between
Sihanouk and Cambodia's Vietnam-backed prime minister, Hun Sen,
next month. A spokeswoman for Sihanouk said he planned to meet with
Hun Sen on May 2 in Jakarta.

   Judges in Tennessee would be allowed to
carry guns in court for protection under a bill approved in the
state Senate.
   ``We have found incidents in our court in Shelby County and
across the state where members of the judiciary came under attack
and fear for their lives,'' said state Sen. James Kyle, sponsor of
the bill, which passed 23-2 on Thursday and now goes to the House.
   Kyle said judges already are eligible for the ``special deputy''
status needed to legally carry a handgun in Tennessee.
   ``You'll find most all of the judges at your criminal justice
center are armed, quite frankly,'' he said. ``If we trust these
people with administering the law, we ought to trust them with how

   Former first lady Nancy Reagan's anti-drug
crusade took her to a late-night police raid on a suspected cocaine
``rock house,'' an experience she found ``very depressing.''
   ``I was able to see them busting in,'' said Mrs. Reagan, who
wore a blue police windbreaker and running shoes to the Thursday
night raid. ``I always see the other end, kids who are in
rehabilitation.''
   Police Chief Daryl Gates, who brought Mrs. Reagan to the raid,
said she had expressed an interest previously in going on a drug
bust but was unable to do so as first lady because of security
concerns.
   The raid took place in the city's beleaguered south central
section, where gangs such as the Crips and Bloods wage war on each
other, often using semiautomatic weapons such as the AK-47 to carry
out their vendettas.
   Police arrested 14 people and seized a small quantity of what
they believed to be crystalline rock cocaine as Mrs. Reagan
watched. Earlier in the evening, police said she witnessed
undercover officers making drug purchases.
   ``It's awful to see when you think that these people have no
lives. It's very sad,'' she said, remarking on the arrests and the
house's sparse furnishings.
   Gates said the house was called a ``rock house'' and a ``smoke
house'' because drug users would use it as a location for smoking
cocaine. The name is derived from the crystalline ``rocks'' of
cocaine peddled and from the fortifications which are often
installed in such homes by drug dealers.
   ``We gave her the opportunity to see what the dope trade is
about,'' Gates said. ``She was right there when the SWAT team went
in.''
   She did not talk to any of those arrested, but one of them said,
``Hello Mrs. Reagan.''
   ``Now, it's too late for them,'' she said. ``What a waste. What
wasted lives.''
   Mrs. Reagan, 65, who made the war against drugs a cornerstone of
Reagan administration policy, has continued her anti-drug
activities since she returned to the West Coast with former
President Reagan.
   One bystander, Elliott Davis, 21, said his sister was among
those arrested.
   ``If it's going to help, I think it's good,'' he said of the
raid and Mrs. Reagan's involvement. ``I hope she talks to the
people who are using, because I think she'd be an inspiration.''
   A crowd of about 50 people gathered after the raid. Some among
them started calling out: ``Nancy, Nancy Reagan.'' A few made
gestures associated with street gang membership, but most were well
behaved.
   Commenting on security procedures employed for the raid, Gates
quipped, ``I'm sure the Secret Service agents have aged about ten
years.''
   Mrs. Reagan interjected, ``Along with my husband,'' who was home
in Bel-Air.
   A drug rehabilitation center that will bear the name of the
former first lady is planned in the San Fernando Valley community
of Lake View Terrace about 25 miles northwest of downtown.

Eastern Airlines:
   _Feb. 1 _ Eastern rejects binding arbitration offer by National
Mediation Board, which declares a 30-day cooling-off period.
   _Feb. 9 _ Eastern suspends about 100 Machinists union members
without pay after sporadic walkouts and slowdowns.
   _Feb. 15 _ More than 97 percent of the 8,500 Machinists
authorize a strike. Eastern still seeks $150 million in wage
concessions; Machinists want $50 million in raises.
   _Feb. 22 _ Federal mediator begins meeting again with Eastern
and union officials. No progress reported.
   _March 1 _ Eastern makes sweetened contract offer to pilots to
try to keep them flying if Machinists strike.
   _March 2 _ Pilots reject offer. Eastern offers Machinists new
contract that would reduce pay but keep it 13 percent higher than
employees who took 1986 cut.
   _March 3 _ President Bush refuses mediation board request to use
authority under Railway Labor Act to delay strike 60 days.
Machinists sent home for the day after Eastern alleges planned
sabotage. Machinists reject latest contract offer. Eastern cancels
up to 75 percent of weekend flights but pledges to hire substitute
workers. Talks collapse at midnight.
   _March 4 _ Strike begins, canceling almost 90 percent of Eastern
flights, stranding passengers across nation, in Caribbean and Latin
America.
   _March 5 _ Few Eastern flights take off as pilots honor the
strike. Eastern warns pilots they risk their future by honoring the
Machinists' picket lines. Machinists threaten to create nationwide
commuter snarls by picketing 12 commuter railroads and Amtrak, but
cancel plans after federal judge in New York bars employees on
three of the rail lines from honoring picket lines.
   _March 6 _ Eastern idles 7,000 non_union workers and cancels all
flights except those on its Northeast shuttle and three round_trips
weekly between Miami and South America. Airline asks federal judge
to order pilots back to work.
   _March 7 _ Federal judge refuses to order Eastern pilots back to
work. Eastern warns it cannot operate for more than 48_72 hours
without pilots and could file for bankruptcy protection. Pilots
union reports overture by management seeking new talks. Eastern
furloughs 2,500 more employees. Threatened national safety slowdown
by pilots' union has only sporadic effect. House subcommittee
approves bill that would require Bush to intervene in strike. Bush
reiterates opposition to intervention but says he will ask Congress
to ban secondary boycotts if the Machinists try to shut down rail
service.
   _March 8 _ TWA Chairman Carl Icahn says he is willing to talk
with Machinists asking him to seek control of Eastern. Machinists
fail to win court permission to shut down commuter railroads in the
New York City and Philadelphia areas. Eastern announces reduced
shuttle rates _ weekend one_way fares to $12 and weekdays fares to
$49. USAir announces deal to acquire Eastern's two
Philadelphia_Canada routes and eight gates at Philadelphia airport.
   _March 9 _ Eastern files for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.
   _March 15 _ A federal bankruptcy judge issues an emergency order
forcing Eastern's rivals to honor pacts with the carrier for
transferring passengers and cargo.
   _March 16 _ Eastern tells its remaining workers to put in up to
60 hours a week without overtime and take periodic time off without
pay.
   _March 20 _ Flight attendants call a strike at Continental
Airlines, Eastern's sister carrier. Real estate tycoon Donald Trump
seeks to cut at least $125 million from the $365 million he agreed
to pay last October for Eastern's Northeast shuttle.
   _March 24 _ Continental flight attendants end a four-day walkout.
   _March 30 _ Texas Air Corp. rejected a $464 million buyout
proposal for Eastern from a group headed by Baseball Commissioner
Peter Ueberroth. Sources said the company may have been leaning
toward a higher offer from billionaire Hyatt hotel executive Jay
Pritzker.
   _March 31 _ Trump announced he had completed a restructured deal
to buy Eastern's Northeast shuttle for $365 million. The new deal
provides him with four additional Boeing 727s.
   _April 4 _ Ueberroth's group makes a new offer to purchase
Eastern, according to airline industry and baseball sources. Senate
Democrats withdraw from the floor legislation requiring Bush to
intervene in the strike.
   _April 6 _ Texas Air announces the Ueberroth group will acquire
Eastern and a 19.9 percent stake in the System One reservations
system in a deal valued at $464 million. Under the deal, Eastern
employees would own 30 percent of the airline company in return for

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar slipped slightly against the
Japanese yen today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index
rebounded after the previous day's sharp decline.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
365.01 points Thursday, its second-largest decline this year,
recouped 189.27 points, or 0.57 percent, finishing the week at
33,185.05.
   The dollar closed at 132.08 yen, down 0.07 yen from its
132.15-yen finish on Thursday. The U.S. currency opened at 132.10
yen and ranged 132.07 to 132.15 yen.
   ``The dollar-yen exchange rate stayed around the 132-yen level
all day. There were no major moves, mainly because participants
stayed on the sidelines because of the upcoming announcement of
U.S. unemployment figures,'' said a trader with Mitsubishi Bank,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. jobless rate for March was to be announced later today
in Washington.
   On the stock exchange, ``The Nikkei index recovered mainly
because the market still expects prices to go higher despite the
setback yesterday (Thursday),'' said Manji Ueda of Nomura
Securities.
   ``Japan's economic fundamentals and buying interest at the
beginning of the new business year are both strong enough to
overcome concern over political instability, which, however, is a
discouraging factor, of course,'' he said.
   For most Japanese companies, the fiscal year begins April 1.
   Trading was active, with volume on the market's first section
estimated at 1.3 billion shares, up from 1.2 billion shares on
Thursday.
   The government of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has been
rocked by a stock-profiteering scandal that surfaced last summer.
Opposition parties are calling for Takeshita's resignation
following reports he received large donations from Recruit Co., the
company at the center of the scandal.
   News reports today said Takeshita received a $190,000
contribution from the information conglomerate in 1986 in addition
to the previously disclosed $380,000 he received at two 1987
fund-raising parties.
   In the stock scandal, Recruit offered hundreds of thousands of
bargain-priced unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary to about
150 influential political and business figures. The recipients then
profited handsomely when the stocks were publicly traded and rose
quickly in value.
   Prosecutors have arrested 14 people on bribery and securities
law violation charges, and three Cabinet members have resigned in
connection with the scandal. Support for Takeshita has dropped as
low as 9 percent in recent public opinion polls.

<HEAD>Philippines Court Clears Way For Civil Suits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Philippines court has cleared the
way for the trial of more than a dozen lawsuits aimed at recovering
billions of dollars allegedly stolen by former President Ferdinand
Marcos and his wife, Imelda.
   In a decision made Thursday and released today, the Philippines
anti-graft court said the couple had repeatedly ignored summonses
to answer the civil suits. The court also rejected claims that
Marcos was too ill to respond to the allegations.
   In New York, however, U.S. attorneys agreed Thursday to
temporarily separate Marcos from its $345 million racketeering case
because they said he was in too poor of health to stand trial
anytime soon.
   The U.S. government's action means only the case against Imelda
Marcos and others will proceed for now.
   The decision by the Philippines court clears the way for at
least 13 civil suits to go to trial. They are among 40 suits filed
by the government in July 1987 against Marcos, his wife and about
300 associates to recover up to $10 billion they allegedly
plundered during his 20-year rule.
   The suits claim a total $112 billion dollars in damages.
   Thursday's ruling means the trial can proceed even if the
Marcoses are not represented by attorneys.
   The Marcoses have been living in Honolulu since the February
1986 civilian-military revolt that ended his rule and swept Corazon
Aquino to power.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow the Marcoses to return for
security reasons.
   Thursday's ruling noted repeated efforts by Filipino officials
to serve the summonses on the Marcoses in Honolulu. It said all of
the summonses were ignored and the couple was declared in default.
   Under Philippine law, defendants in civil suits who are outside
the country may be served summonses at their last known address or
through publication in a newspaper in that area. A court may
declare a defendant in default if he fails to answer the summons in
60 days.
   For the Marcoses, that deadline lapsed Jan. 9, the ruling noted.
   The court's decision also said: ``The claim that defendant
Ferdinand E. Marcos has been seriously ill and hospitalized several
times as to make him incompetent to be put on notice ... is
absolutely devoid of merit. Such a claim is incredible and has no
legal bearing in the case at point.''
   Marcos, 71, is in guarded condition in Hawaii at St. Francis
Medical Center, where he has been confined since Jan. 15 for
treatment of heart and respiratory problems.
   In New York, the Marcoses are accused of siphoning more than
$100 million from their homeland's treasury and using the money to
buy art and real estate. Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent and is
free on $5 million bail.

   Imelda Marcos vowed to fight alone, if
necessary, against federal racketeering charges after her ailing
husband was temporarily severed from the case because of his poor
health.
   Prosecutors conceded that former Philippine President Ferdinand
E. Marcos is too ill to stand trial for now and agreed on Thursday
to separate him temporarily from the massive racketeering case.
   But his wife, who still faces trial in New York, remained
defiant.
   ``I look forward to defending myself. You don't have to be a
doctor to see how sick the president is,'' the former first lady
told The Associated Press in Honolulu. ``If I have to face the
court alone, so be it. I will walk into the courtroom with my head
held high.''
   Prosecutors wrote to the judge presiding over the case,
acknowledging that Marcos' health has deteriorated since a medical
examination by a government doctor last fall.
   ``Based upon Mr. Marcos' repeated bouts of pneumonia and his
susceptibility to other infection since January 1989, the
government is no longer able to represent to the court that Mr.
Marcos is now able to stand trial,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra
Livingston wrote to U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan in a letter
dated April 5 and disclosed Thursday.
   Marcos, 71, is in guarded condition at St. Francis Medical
Center in Honolulu, where he has been confined since Jan. 15 for
treatment of heart, kidney and respiratory problems.
   ``It's about time and I'm not surprised,'' said Richard Hibey, a
Marcos lawyer in Washington, D.C. ``I think there is ample and
uncontradicted medical evidence that he is in a grave and
deteriorating physical condition from which he is not likely to
survive.''
   Marcos was examined during the weekend by Francis Weld, a
court-appointed physician from New York, who examined Marcos last
October and determined that he was fit to travel to New York.
   But according to Ms. Livingston's letter, after his latest
examination Weld concluded that Marcos' health had deteriorated.
   The Marcoses are accused of siphoning more than $100 million
from their homeland's treasury and using the money to buy art and
real estate in New York. Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent and is
free on $5 million bail posted by a friend, tobacco heiress Doris
Duke.
   The Marcoses, eight associates _ including Saudi Arabian
businessman Adnan Khashoggi _ and a California bank were indicted
last October.

   Suspicious city council members, resisting the
popularity and charm of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, have
rejected a proposal to form a sister-city relationship with the
Soviet city of Volgograd.
   After a spirited three-hour debate Thursday, the council voted
9-8 against a proposal to establish formal cultural ties with
Volgograd, formerly called Stalingrad. Volgograd is 600 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   Councilman William Boytchuk, who is of Ukrainian descent, led
the campaign against the proposal, saying the Soviets are not to be
trusted.
   ``Do not be fooled by his colorful rhetoric and undeniable
charm,'' Boytchuk said, referring to Gorbachev.
   Most of the 300 people who packed the city council chambers for
Thursday's debate seemed to agree. Boytchuk got thunderous applause
from the audience when he said: ``Volgograd _ Nyet, Nyet, Nyet.''
   But some city politicians were disappointed, having hoped the
move might foster international peace and understanding.
   ``It's a retrograde step in the pursuit of world peace,'' said
Councilman Jack Layton. ``It sends out a message that we still
believe in the mentality of the Cold War.''

   Japanese buyers drove bidding at an auction of
famous signatures to more than $40,000 for the late Emperor
Hirohito's name on a simple courtesy letter, proving ``you can't
measure love,'' an auctioneer said.
   ``Hands started coming up everywhere,'' said Herman Darvick of
the moment bidding began on the 1934 document that was expected to
bring up to $3,000 at an auction where Abraham Lincoln drew $1,540
and Indira Gandhi, $1,500.
   Bidders quickly boosted the value of what was described by
Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions as an ``exceedingly rare early
manuscript Letter of State in Japanese.''
   ``I was standing. I could feel my knees buckling when it got
past $20,000,'' Darvick said.
   Several bidders Thursday kept their hands up right through the
$30,000 point. The gavel finally came down at $42,000 to loud
applause.
   ``You can get a complete autograph collection of all the U.S.
presidents from Washington to Bush for under $42,000,'' Darvick
said.
   The auctioneer's 10 percent commission at the sale at a
Manhattan hotel for 100 enthusiasts raised the price to $46,200.
   ``It's going back to Japan, where it should be,'' said Darvick.
   ``This is unique. I can't think of any other autograph going
like this one did,'' he said, adding that the enthusiasm seemed
based on emotion rather than investment value.
   Darvick said he misjudged ``the nation of Japan and their love
for their emperor.''
   Masayuki Miyamoto, who placed the winning bid on behalf of a
Japanese bank which was representing a client in Japan, declined to
say anything about the buyer.
   The letter was consigned by Carmen Mendieta Garcia-Velez,
daughter of Carlos Mendieta Y. Montefur, to whom Hirohito sent it
after Montefur was elected provisional president of the Republic of
Cuba on Jan. 18, 1934.
   The letter, signed boldly by Hirohito and K. Hirota, minister of
foreign affairs, said in part that the leaders ``send our sincere
wishes for the personal success of your excellency, in the same way
for the prosperity of his nation.''
   Hirohito, who was buried Feb. 24 in an elaborate funeral, was
worshipped by his people as a living god and branded a war criminal
in the later half of his 87-year life.
   Norio Murai, a New York resident who was one of the last bidders
to drop out, said it was very rare for a signature of Hirohito to
come up at auction and would only occur outside Japan.
   ``If he writes a letter to people, do you think somebody would
put it up for auction? People wouldn't think of it. It would be a
family treasure,'' he said.

   The Bush Administration does not plan to
modernize the nation's surveillance satellites despite a promise
last year by President Reagan, according to a report published
today.
   The New York Times quoted the chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, Sen. David L. Boren, D-Okla., as saying
failure to improve the satellites ``would seriously jeopardize''
the national security.
   Improving the satellites was a condition for last year's Senate
approval of a treaty eliminating medium-range missiles.
   The Times noted that the Bush administration had presented its
intention not to improve the satellites ``as a proposal, not a
final decision.''
   Boren declined to discuss specifics of the program, the Times
said, but some experts described it as a multibillion dollar effort
to provide more KH-11 and LaCrosse surveillance satellites as well
as more personnel to analyze photographic and radar data.
   The KH-11 takes high resolution photographs and the LaCrosse
uses radar for surveillance at night and through clouds.
   Boren told the Times that if the Bush administration continues
with the plan not to improve satellite surveillance, it could
greatly damage the president's relationship with the Senate.
   Boren, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, also said that if
the administration fails to improve the system it ``would seriously
jeopardize our own near-term national security interests and could
slow down completion of a strategic arms reduction treaty.''
   The Senate Intelligence Committee last year extracted a promise
that the surveillance system would be modernized after threatening
to hold up approval of the treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear
Forces, which bans medium- and short-range missiles on land.
   The treaty was signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at a Moscow summit meeting in June 1988.

   The fired captain of the Exxon tanker
that crashed into an Alaska reef and spilled more than 10 million
gallons of oil was released from jail after posting drastically
reduced bail of $25,000.
   Justice Thomas Stark, the supervising judge of Suffolk County
Criminal Court, said Thursday that the bond initially set at $1
million for Capt. Joseph Hazelwood was ``unconstitutionally
excessive.''
   He said there was little chance of Hazelwood jumping bail and
set it at the amount prosecutors originally had requested.
   A stone-faced Hazelwood, who was allegedly drunk when the Exxon
Valdez crashed into a reef on March 24, left the Suffolk County
jail Thursday, walked past reporters without comment and left in a
car with his lawyers.
   On Wednesday, state Supreme Court Justice Kenneth Rohl set bail
for Hazelwood at $1 million bond or $500,000 cash, comparing the
effect of the ship's oil spill in Alaska to the atomic bombing of
Hiroshima.
   ``The amount of bail is not commensurate with the seriousness of
the crime or the effect of the crime on the community,'' said Stark
after listening to an emotional appeal from Hazelwood attorney
Thomas Russo.
   On March 24, Hazelwood turned control of the Valdez over to a
third mate uncertified to pilot the vessel in the waters off
Alaska. The ship hit a reef, gushing crude oil into Prince William
Sound.
   Hazelwood, 42, faces three misdemeanor charges in Alaska of
operating a ship while intoxicated, reckless endangerment, and
negligent discharge of oil. The charges in the nation's largest oil
spill carry a combined maximum penalty of 2\ years in prison and a
$10,000 fine. He has 30 days to prepare for an extradition hearing.
   Federal regulations prohibit commercial operators from having
0.04 percent alcohol in their blood. Authorities said Hazelwood had
a 0.061 percent level nine hours after the accident.
   Asked by investigators what was the problem, Hazelwood said, ``I
think you're looking at it,'' according to a court affidavit.
   Hazelwood was fired by the Exxon Corp., which bans alcohol on
its ships. The captain was twice arrested on drunken driving
charges and his drivers' license was suspended three times.

<HEAD>Amazon Rain Forest Conservation Plan Announced By President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Castigating those who make ``cruel''
charges that Brazil is destroying its vast jungle, President Jose
Sarney has announced a $350 million plan to protect its Amazon rain
forest.
   ``Our priority is the conservation of our ecological heritage,''
Sarney said Thursday in announcing a program called ``Our Nature,''
which creates forest preserves and additional Indian reservations
and bans timber exports.
   Sarney criticized the ``alarmist tone of the international
campaign'' and said satellite photos showed only 5 percent of
Brazil's rain forest had been destroyed, compared with estimates of
up to 12 percent.
   Describing the 2 million square miles of rain forest as
``Brazil's sovereign patrimony,'' he said Brazilians are ``accused
of something we cannot accept, of destroying our own territory.''
   Such charges of environmental destruction are ``cruel and unfair
.. . full of scientific falsehoods that misinform the world,''
Sarney said. Politicians, scientists and ambassadors from
neighboring South American countries attended the ceremony at the
presidential palace.
   Ecologists say destruction of the rain forest adds to the
``greenhouse effect,'' a warming trend that is warming the planet
and affecting its weather, but Brazil has rebuffed proposals for
foreign participation in conservation.
   ``Our Nature,'' which also establishes an Environmental Fund,
includes 17 presidential decrees and seven bills to be sent to
Congress.
   Among the measures are:
   _Ending financial incentives for cattle ranching in the Amazon,
seen as the single greatest factor in destruction of the rain
forest. World Bank figures say the 1975-86 investment in ranching
exceeded $1 billion.
   _Government control of mercury, which is used by gold miners in
the Amazon and has become a major source of water pollution. The
government also would rehabilitate areas damaged by mining.
   _Creation of a special forest police force to control fires set
by ranchers and farmers to clear jungle land, to be aided by the
armed forces and satellite photos.
   _Mapping ``agro-ecological zones'' to determine which parts of
the Amazon can be developed without environmental damage, aided by
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
   Sarney said the goal is ``a permanent and economically viable
development program, ecologically adequate, politically balanced
and socially just.''
   Brazil has set aside 124,000 square miles of land in the past
four years for its 220,000 native Indians, he said, and reserving
another 160,000 is under study.
   The president said ``Our Nature'' would cost Brazil $350 million
in the first two years and the government would welcome help from
abroad, ``but we will not accept tutelage,'' he said.
   ``Our doors are open to cooperation from the world, but without
conditions,'' he declared.
   As he has before, Sarney rejected proposals to trade part of
Brazil's $115 billion foreign debt for investment in conservation
projects, which he called ``an attempt to convert ecology into
business.''

   Police are on the lookout for a
Middle Eastern terrorist group believed to be preparing an attack
at a Scandinavian airport, public television reported today.
   Ole Noergaard, vice commisioner of police, was quoted as
confirming earlier reports that authorities in the region were on
alert after receiving a tip on a possible attack.
   Police have a secret list with the names of 12 suspected members
of the PFLP-General Command who left Syria last week bound for
Scandinavia, the report said. Neither the names nor the source of
the police information was revealed.
   According to the report, the group was expected to travel via
Hamburg, West Germany, and assemble later in a Scandinavian country
to attempt a hijack or airport attack.
   International and domestic airports in Denmark, Sweden, Norway
and Finland stepped up security earlier this week after police
notified them of the threat.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Europe, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was steady at lower levels in thin
European trading late this morning as the market awaited the
release of the U.S. unemployment figures for March later in the day.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   Traders said the dollar was almost certain to stay locked within
a narrow range until after the unemployment figures were released
this afternoon.
   ``The dollar has been trading sideways for three days and now
the dollar has virtually come to a standstill,'' one Rome trader
said.
   But he noted that the market was waiting for the unemployment
figures to give it direction.
   Economists were expecting the unemployment rate to rise to 5.2
percent in March from 5.1 percent in February.
   If the report turns out to be as expected, the dollar likely
would decline gradually, a trader said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.07 yen to a closing 132.08 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 131.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8690 West German marks, down from 1.8700
   _1.6410 Swiss francs, down from 1.6415
   _6.3075 French francs, down from 6.3125
   _2.1085 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1090
   _1,371.25 Italian lire, down from 1,371.75
   _1.1925 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1935
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7030, compared with
$1.7035 Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $384.50 a troy ounce,
down from $384.75 bid late Thursday. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$384.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $384.40, up from $384.35 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 59 cents to close at a bid
$386.15.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.82 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Friday.

<HEAD>Soviets Admit Sending Fighter Jets To Libya</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with Britain criticizing Soviet explanation;
no pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets have confirmed they sent fighter jets
last month to the radical North African Arab state of Libya but
insist the planes do not have the range to threaten Libya's
neighbors or Israel.
   Britain today rejected the Soviet explanation as frivolous, but
said the dispute will not spoil the the visit of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, in London
with Gorbachev, first told a news conference he did not know about
the sale. Later, however, Gerasimov went on television to confirm
elements of the report while seeking to minimize its significance.
   Gerasimov insisted during interviews Thursday on Channel 4 News
and BBC-TV that the number of jets sent was ``around half a
dozen,'' not 12 to 15 as reported by U.S. administration officials.
   U.S. Defense Department sources have said the aircraft are Su-24
Fencers, which can fly an 800-mile radius without refueling, enough
to reach Egypt and possibly Israel. They say Soviet transports
carried the dismantled jets to Libya in crates.
   Washington reports of the warplanes' sale were headlined in
Britain, dimming the glow emanating from Gorbachev's talks with
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The prime minister's spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher asked
Gorbachev for an explanation and got none.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe also raised the issue with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. When Shevardnadze
brought up British arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Howe replied that
Britain was concerned because Libya is a terrorist state, the
British spokesman reported.
   Gerasimov did not specify the type of aircraft sold in his TV
interviews. He said the planes were supplied to Libya under a 1986
deal _ ``an old contract'' _ and that not more than six were sold.
   ``This is not a long-range bomber,'' Gerasimov said. ``This is a
bomber that you can use for closer activities. Its operational
range is 300 miles.
   ``It's a frontline bomber. It's for defense only. You cannot
really use it for offensive purposes.''
   The interviewer noted that the planes could reach Israel if
refueled in the air, to which Gerasimov replied: ``Theoretically
maybe, but Libya has no refueling capacity at all.''
   He said on BBC-TV that the warplanes were delivered in March and
suggested they would not be operational for some time because they
were delivered ``in crates ... You must put them together. It takes
time and know-how to do it.''
   Foreign Minister William Waldegrave was critical of the Soviet
explanation.
   ``It's a rather odd style for a major arms deal, to say that the
planes do not really work and will stay in their boxes,'' he said
in a radio interview. ``Why sell them in that case?''
   Waldegrave said Gerasimov's argument that the planes were
defensive was `` slightly frivolous.'' He also rejected comparisons
to the British arms sale to Saudi Arabia.
   ``If you want to say the Saudi regime, in its behavior
internationally, is comparable to the Libyan regime in its behavior
internationally ... I think he is pulling our leg a little,''
Waldegrave said.
   But Waldegrave said the deal ``won't sour the talks, in the
sense that the whole of this relationship we now have with the
Soviet Union is one where we can build trust.''
   Gerasimov told the news conference he suspected the report was
leaked ``just to ruin the atmosphere'' of the Gorbachev-Thatcher
summit.

<HEAD>`Forbidden City' Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of playwright in lead and last graf. No PMs

<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early in ``The Forbidden City,'' the late
playwright Bill Gunn draws a realistic picture of a troubled black
family in 1936 Philadelphia. But the play runs into trouble as he
turns from realism to the bizarre.
   The acting in the play, which opened Thursday at the
off-Broadway Public Theater's LuEsther Hall, is exemplary. Joseph
Papp directed, and Loren Sherman created an elaborate, solid,
two-story interior, possibly too upscale for 1936.
   Gloria Foster plays the most fully drawn character, Molly
Hoffenburg. She's a rather elegant matron, who dusts her carefully
displayed figurines, dresses tastefully, and is generous with food
to men put out of work by the Depression.
   She's disappointed with her 16-year-old son, who wets the bed
and is considered a learning problem at school, and she gets
hysterical when he mentions his older brother, who died young in
the South after no doctor would see him.
   Eventually, Molly is revealed to have dreamed of becoming a
movie star and to have wanted her father to kill a white man for
her because she can't realize her dream. With those feelings
unfaded, she finally lets herself be picked up by a rich white man,
hoping he'll take her to expensive places. He takes her to a cheap
hotel.
   Frankie R. Faison plays her adoring husband. Even after he finds
out about her assignation, he sympathizes with her shame. He runs a
garage and also works another job, to provide for his family.
Everything he dreamed of, he says, he has.
   The son, Nick, seems almost retarded but can recite poetry and
has won a prize for creative writing. His dead brother appears to
him from time to time, played by Dimitri Corbin.
   Instead of this being chilling, it's puzzling. Is he meant as a
figment of Nick's imagination or a supernatural being?
   Nick provokes the violent end of the play by saying his brother
enters his body and tells him to kill a white person and put the
blood in his mother's brandy as reparation for her loss. The play's
tone turns decidely odd.
   The farther the playwright travels from reality, the less his
writing can handle it and the less the audience understands either
the story or the intended message.

<HEAD>China, Taiwan Sign Accord For Taiwanese Athletes To Compete In China</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads throughout to ADD Taiwanese government delegation also

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan and China have signed an agreement
that will allow Taiwanese athletes to compete in mainland China for
the first time in four decades, officials said today.
   The announcement came one day after Taiwan agreed to send an
official delegation to China for the first time. The 12-member
Taiwanese government delegation, led by Finance Minister Shirley
Kuo, will attend the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank
in Beijing next month.
   The decisions were regarded as steps in a Nationalist inititive
to counter Communist China's efforts to isolate Taiwan
internationally.
   The agreement for the athletes' visit was signed Thursday in
Hong Kong after two months of negotiations, Chang Feng-hsu,
chairman of the Taiwan Olympic Committee, told a news conference.
   Officials said the agreement would permit Taiwan to send a team
to the Asian Junior Gymnastics championship, which begins in
Beijing on April 21.
   Taiwan also plans to compete in next year's Asian Games in
Beijing, and 10 other international sports competitions in China
later this year, officials said.
   Ho Zhen-liang, deputy chairman of China's Olympic Committee,
signed the agreement for China.
   Chang said the Chinese also withdrew an earlier demand for
Chinese teams to compete in sports meets in Taiwan.
   ``They understood that it would take some time before we could
agree to their visits here,'' Chang said.
   In Beijing, the Chinese Olympic Committee Vice President He
Zhenliang said, ``This is a major development in the sports
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. It will give
a great impetus to the promotion of brotherhood and mutual
understanding.''
   The decision to send the government delegation did not signal a
change in government policies toward China, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Chen Yu-chu. He said Taiwan would continue to oppose
official contacts with the rival Communists, who won a civil war in
1949.
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan, claim they are the sole
legitimate government of all China.
   Chang Chung-tung, history professor at the National Taiwan
University, described the government's decision as ``a major
breakthrough'' and said it was probably intended to pressure the
Chinese Communists to accept de facto Nationalist rule over this
island.
   In 1987, the Nationalists adopted a more flexible policy on
private contacts with the Chinese communists, but the government
continues to refuse to deal directly with the Beijing government.
   The new policy has led to an exchange of visits, trade and
cultural ties between Taiwanese and Chinese.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers from Missouri and Kansas proposed
legislation today to tighten regulation of interstate shipments of
hazardous materials, including radioactive wastes.
   Citizens ``have a right to expect that hazardous materials will
be transported through their state as safely as possible,'' said
Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., one of the measure's sponsors.
   In remarks prepared for delivery when the legislation is
introduced today in the Senate, Danforth said it was partly
prompted by concerns over the shipment of spent nuclear fuel by
railroad through the Midwest from the damaged Three Mile Island
nuclear plant in Pennsylvania to a federal laboratory in Idaho.
   Also sponsoring the measure were Sens. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.,
and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.
   Bond said the bill would plug ``dangerous loopholes'' in current
regulations.
   The legislation would require:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Rail shipments of high-level radioactive materials to move only
by ``dedicated trains,'' which means their sole purpose is to carry
the nuclear materials. Currently, shippers can transport such
materials on ``mixed'' trains carrying other freight. The TMI
materials are moved by single-purpose trains but that is not
required by law.
   ``We cannot take the risk of mixing hazardous materials such as
the Three Mile Island wastes with cars full of everything from
grain to dangerous chemicals,'' Bond said.
   _The Transportation Department to establish standards to guide
shippers in selecting routes for transporting high-level
radioactive wastes or spent nuclear fuel. Danforth said ``decisions
on modes and routes for nuclear shipments now are made at the whim
of the shipper, who often is more concerned about cost-cutting than
safety.''
   _The Nuclear Regulatory Commission to certify the safety of all
shipping packages for transporting nuclear materials. Currently the
Energy Department approves the containers used for its shipments,
such as the TMI materials, while the NRC standards apply to other
packages.
   _Trucking companies carrying hazardous materials to obtain a
permit from the Transportation Department. The permit requirement
would apply to motor carriers carrying radioactive materials, some
explosives and those materials ``extremely toxic by inhalation.''
   The legislation also would prohibit a motor carrier from
carrying hazardous materials if DOT auditors gave it a
``unsatisfactory'' rating for having too many safety violations.
The ratings are assigned now under the agency's safety auditing
system and Danforth said about 1,110 hazardous materials carriers
have unsatisfactory safety ratings.
   _All hazardous materials warning labels and placards to remain
on shipping packages or vehicles until the materials have been
removed. The provision is to prevent accidents such as one that
killed six Kansas City firefighters last year at a construction
site.
   There was no warning placard on a trailer containing tons of
blasting agent and it exploded after catching on fire. Firefighters
have said they were unaware of the hazardous materials.
   The bill also calls for the government to provide for 20
Transportation Department inspectors for shipments of radioactive
materials, and require that all high-level radioactive shipments be
inspected at their starting point.

<HEAD>Nearly 100 People Slightly Injured in 3 Separate Train Accidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 100 people suffered minor injuries and some 1,000
children had to be evacuated in three separate train accidents, but
an official in one case said ``it was a miracle no one was killed.''
   A truck driver ignored crossing signals and drove around
railroad gates, driving his semitrailer into the path of a commuter
train and causing a collision that injured at least 68 people, said
Will County Sheriff John Johnsen in Lemont, Ill.
   An Amtrak passenger train that derailed near the Virginia-North
Carolina border injured 28 people.
   And in Princeton, Ind., liquid nitrogen and herbicides that
spilled from storage containers prompted the evacuation of children
from two nearby schools. One injury was reported.
   State's Attorney Edward Burmila said a decision would be made
today on whether to charge truck driver James R. Krueger with the
Illinois accident.
   The gate was down and red warning signals were flashing when the
collision occurred Thursday, Johnsen said.
   Most of the injuries appeared to be minor, officials said. The
rush-hour commuter train carrying 98 people had picked up
passengers in Joliet and Lockport and was en route to Chicago.
   ``It was a miracle no one was killed,'' Johnsen said.
   The engineer, James Mullin, saw the truck going around the
crossing and knew it would be impossible to avoid impact, and
immediately slammed on the brakes, said Chris Knapton, a spokesman
for the commuter rail line in Chicago.
   The engineer ``wheeled around, opened the door, plunged into the
walkway and held on for dear life. If he had not done that, he
would be dead,'' Knapton said.
   All four passenger cars derailed and the engine was knocked
nearly on its side.
   Six cars and both engines of Amtrak's Silver Star derailed near
Skippers, a Greensville County town six miles south of Emporia, Va.
The train, with 519 passengers aboard, was traveling from Tampa and
Miami in Florida to New York.
   Lt. D.W. Robertson of the Virginia State Police said the train
had two engines and 18 cars. He said the cause of the derailment,
which occurred on CSX Corp. tracks, has not been determined.
   In Indiana, a CSX train slipped off a railway spur and caused a
chain reaction that toppled the storage tank at a fertilizer
company, authorities said.
   Police dispatcher Tom Perry said the chemicals involved were not
volatile and gave off no fumes.
   ``When they finally evaluated the chemicals that were on the
ground, there was very little of anything other than liquid
nitrogen,'' he said. ``There was nothing that was harmful other
than to the touch.''

<HEAD>Alimony Rates Higher for White, College Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The likelihood of alimony being awarded
divorced or separated women is twice as high if they are aged 40 or
over than it is if they are under 30, a new Census Bureau study
shows.
   The study also showed that alimony was twice as likely for white
women than for blacks.
   And college graduates are significantly more likely to win
alimony than women who failed to finish high school, said the study
released Thursday.
   ``They know how to use the system, it's as simple as that,''
said Census statistician Mary Henson of the higher alimony rates
for white and more educated women.
   According to the study, alimony was awarded to 15.8 percent of
white women whose marriages had broken up, compared to only 8.0
percent of blacks. The alimony rate for Hispanic women, who can be
of any race, was 11.0 percent.
   The report, ``Child Support and Alimony, 1985,'' also repeated
figures, detailed by the Census Bureau last August, showing a
significant decline in child support payments received by women
between 1983 and 1985.
   The new version adds details on alimony and property settlements
when couples are divorced or separated.
   In addition to alimony, white women were more likely than blacks
to receive property settlements, and the share receiving a cash
settlement was higher for college-educated women.
   As to the greater likelihood of women over age 40 receiving
alimony, Ms. Henson commented that court awards were more common in
past years, while more younger women either receive voluntary
payments from former spouses or do not seek support payments.
Studies have shown that alimony awards were more common prior to
the mid-1970s than they have been since then.
   The new analysis showed a drop in average alimony payments from
$4,293 in 1983 to $3,733 in 1985. That paralleled the decline,
reported last August, in child support payments, which fell from
$2,528 in 1983 to $2,215 in 1985.
   In addition to the racial and ethnic differences found in the
1985 alimony payments, the study found the highest rate amomng
women with four years of college or more _ 17.7 percent receiving
alimony.
   Next were high school graduates at 15.3 percent, nearly the same
as the 15.2 percent for women who had attended but not finished
college. Only 11.8 percent of women who failed to complete high
school had been awarded alimony.
   By age, 18.5 percent of divorced or separated women aged 40 and
over had been awarded alimony payments, compared to 10.9 percent in
the 30-to-39 age group and only 7.7 percent aged 18 to 29.
   The overall alimony rate was 17.1 percent for divorced women,
13.8 percent for remarried women whose previous marriage had ended
in divorce and 10.0 percent for women who were separated.
   The report noted that 20.7 percent of women who had not been
employed for five years before their separation were awarded
alimony, while the rate fell to 11.8 percent for women who held
full-time jobs when their marriage ended.
   Property settlements were much more common than alimony awards,
the study found.
   For example, 74.2 percent of women had won a settlement
involving the house, car or other property, and 21.6 percent
received a cash settlement.
   Racially, 75.2 percent of white women and 66.0 percent among
blacks had settlemets involving goods such as real estate,
furniture or cars. Hispanic women led in this category, however, at
76.1 percent.
   Turning to cash settlements, white women had a 22.1 percent
rate, compared to 19.0 percent among Hispanics and 14.6 percent for
black women.
   Rates of non-cash settlements were very close among age groups _
74.8 percent for those 30 to 39, 74.0 percent over age 40 and 73.4
percent under age 30. The cash settlement rates were 24.7 percent
for the youngest group, 23.2 percent between 30 and 39 and 20.4
percent over age 40.
   By education, the non-cash settlement rate was highest for women
with the least schooling. Those who had not finished high school
won a non-cash property settlement in 76.1 percent of separations.
But they were least likely to get cash, 18.6 percent.
   For high school graduates, 74.7 percent received non-cash
settments and 20.8 percent got money.
   The non-cash rate was 73.9 percent for women who had attended
college, while 22.1 percent of them obtained cash. Of women with
degrees, 70.4 percent got a non-cash settlement and 27.4 prcent got
cash.

<TEXT>
   Riot police today fired tear gas and rubber
bullets at hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians following Moslem
prayers at the al-Aqsa mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites.
   Clouds of tear gas rose from the complex, located on Temple
Mount, and the sound of shots could be heard from several hundred
meters away.
   Police arrested about 30 demonstrators.
   The violence came after about 15,000 worshipers attended noon
prayers on the first day of Ramadan, the Moslem holy month and a
period of religious fervor. Israeli officials have said they feared
an escalation of the Palestinian uprising during Ramadan.
   After the prayers, several hundred worshipers stayed behind on
the Temple Mount, chanting nationalistic slogans and raising
outlawed Palestinian flags. Demonstrators burned an Israeli flag.
   Two or three Palestinians threw stones at police, and in
response one policeman shot in the air, Israel radio said.
   ``This shot led to the great confusion,'' said Israel radio
reporter Moshe Nussbaum. ``Seconds after the shot was fired, we
were barraged by stones.''
   The stones hit about 10 reporters standing on a roof near the
Temple Mount, and smashed several pieces of equipment.
   A cameraman for Austrian television collapsed after being struck
in the head with a stone and was taken to a hospital.

   Nine-year-old Bobby Rupp was playing
with some friends on the school playground when he caught a falling
star.
   The find substantiates numerous reports Monday of a rare daytime
meteorite spotted from Denver to Salida in south-central Colorado
to Garden City and Salinas in Kansas.
   Just after noon Monday Bobby and some friends at the Prospect
Valley Elementary School in Wheat Ridge caught a glimpse of a
meteor above them.
   ``It was red, blue, yellow, orange. ... And it was on fire,''
Bobby said. ``I was by the fence and looked up ... and I saw a
black piece coming down toward the school.''
   Bobby ran about 50 feet to the corner of the playground where he
thought the object landed. He found a small lavalike rock that was
``hotter than heck.''
   After school, Bobby called his mother, Ingrid Rupp, who said she
doubted her son at first. But on Wednesday, a Colorado School of
Mines geology professor confirmed that the rock was a meteorite.
   ``This little fella saw something very rare,'' said Professor
Robert M. Hutchinson.
   ``There are just a handful of cases (like this) throughout
history,'' said Larry Sessions, an astronomer at the Denver Museum
of Natural History.
   Hutchinson said he believes the rock was a ``stony type''
meteorite that may have come from an asteroid. He has taken a
sample of it to his lab for closer examination.

   Sooner or later almost every motorist tries to
talk his or her way out of a traffic ticket, and Colorado's Gov.
Roy Romer is no exception.
   Romer's car was in the shop Thursday, and he needed to get out
on the Oatmeal Circuit _ early morning campaigning at restaurants
to promote the proposed new airport in next month's special city
election. So he borrowed a car from his son, Mark, who was in
Virginia on business.
   He was on his to his next meeting after the breakfast
appearances when a Denver police officer noticed the license tags
on the car had expired in March and pulled the governor over.
   Romer explained to the unidentified officer that he had no idea
that the tags had expired, press spokeswoman Cindy Parameter said
later.
   The governor used his portable phone to make inquiries and
established that renewal stickers had been delivered although his
son hadn't been home to put them on the car.
   That much established, the officer let the governor go, with a
warning.
   ``It proves I'm human,'' Romer said.

<HEAD>INS Recommends Freeing Dutch Visitor With AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Dutch traveler with AIDS will remain in
jail, despite a recommendation by regional federal immigration
officials that he be allowed to attend an AIDS conference in San
Francisco.
   Hans Paul Verhoef won't be released until the recommendation is
certified by immigration officials in Washington, said Tom
Schiltgen, district director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   Verhoef was taken into custody Sunday at the Minneapolis-St.
Paul International Airport by Customs officials who discovered the
AIDS drug AZT in his baggage and then questioned him about the
disease. Verhoef, an AIDS prevention worker, told authorities he
had AIDS and was en route to the conference.
   Schiltgen said Thursday a decision on certifying the waiver
would be made prior to a hearing scheduled for today. INS spokesman
Greg Leo in Washington confirmed that the recommendation had been
received and would be reviewed.
   ``The INS has established that Mr. Verhoef is an excludable as a
person who is afflicted with a dangerous communicable disease,''
Schiltgen said.
   Schiltgen said earlier that to grant a waiver, the INS must
verify that Verhoef's disease does not pose a health threat and
that the U.S. government would not incur expenses for Verhoef's
care.
   Verhoef, 31, said in an interview from prison that he still
hopes to attend the final days of the National Lesbian and Gay
Health Conference in San Francisco, which ends Sunday.
   But he said his detention may have had some positive benefits.
   ``This morning a woman said to me that I did more things for the
cause being here than being in San Francisco,'' Verhoef said. ``And
I think that's true, because the U.S. government is forced to
revise their policy on having people with AIDS in the country or
not.''
   Jonathan Burris, Verhoef's Minneapolis attorney, said the case
will set ``a national precedent relative to whether or not people
with AIDS will be admitted into the country freely and in what
fashion.''
   Verhoef's incarceration touched off a wave of criticism of
immigration policies and protests in the Twin Cities, San Francisco
and elsewhere.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos declared Thursday ``Hans Verhoef
Day.''
   ``As this room is full today, there is still someone missing,''
Agnos told attendees at the conference. ``He is Hans Paul Verhoef,
an official representative of the City of Delft, Holland.''

   A pipe bomb being assembled by young
people in a home blew up, killing two of them and injuring two
others, and one of the survivors has been arrested on two counts of
murder, police said today.
   A 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old male were killed in
Thursday night's blast. A 17-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy
were slightly injured.
   ``It sounded like dynamite,'' said Frank Continolo, 37, a
neighbor who rushed to the scene and found the children soaked in
blood. ``The house was black on the back side, like the family room
was blown out.''
   The 17-year-old was booked on two counts of murder with a
destructive device. He and the 18-year-old who was killed ``were
making and experimenting with pipe bombs'' and ``one blew up while
being assembled,'' said a police statement.
   Police would not release any of the names but the 10-year-old
girl who was killed was identified by her father as Duyen Nguyen.
Neighbors said the 18-year-old who was killed lived down the street
and was a senior at Oak Grove High School.
   According to witnesses and family members, the injured were
Duyen's 13-year-old brother, Tan, and the 17-year-old boy, who is
related to the family and also attends Oak Grove. They were taken
to Valley Medical Center where nursing supervisor Gail Fitzgerald
described the injuries as minor.
   Two other children in the house at the time were unhurt, police
said.
   Duyen's parents were not at home at the time of the explosion.
They arrived about an hour later and the mother broke down when
told her child was dead.
   Police Capt. Kenneth Hawkes described the pipe bomb as ``fairly
substantial, maybe 10 inches long by an inch and a half or two'' in
diameter.
   Bomb fragments blew holes in both the ceiling and the walls of
the house.

<HEAD>Dissidents Appeal to Thatcher on `Political' Trial</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gorbachev-Britain, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Soviet political activists today gave the
British Embassy a letter asking Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to
protest the trial of a political dissident.
   A British diplomat said the letter would be forwarded to London
today but it would arrive too late for Mrs. Thatcher to discuss the
case with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was ending his visit
to London.
   The letter says the trial of Sergei Kuznetsov in the Ural
Mountains city of Sverdlovsk was called for political reasons
although ``authorities are trying to present it as the usual
criminal trial.''
   Kuznetsov, 35, the Sverdlovsk correspondent for the Moscow-based
underground journal Glasnost, was arrested Dec. 10 while protesting
the detention of political prisoners, said one of the activists,
Tamara Grigoryants.
   Kuznetsov was sentenced to 15 days in jail for administrative
law violations, Mrs. Grigoryants said.
   He was beaten by police in prison, but authorities called the
charges false and accused him of slandering the regional party
chief, the KGB chief and head of a regional police office, Mrs.
Grigoryants said.
   Kuznetsov was put on trial Monday and faces a minimum three-year
jail sentence if convicted, said the woman, the wife of Moscow
dissident Sergei Grigoryants, the editor of Glasnost magazine.
   Kuznetsov began a hunger strike Feb. 22, drinking only water,
but authorities are threatening his ``direct physical
destruction,'' the letter said.
   Another of the political activists, Andrei Mironov, said the
trial was one of the first under Gorbachev of a dissident, and
marked a ``continuation of old political repressions'' and a
``turning point in perestroika,'' the Soviet leader's reform
process.
   Tony Longrigg, the political counselor who met with the group,
said Britain knew about the case. ``Our government takes a strong
line on human rights, and it was reiterated during Mr. Gorbachev's
visit,'' Longrigg said.
   Along with Mrs. Grigoryants and Mironov, the dissident
delegation included Valery Senderov, Kirill Popov and Asya Lashiver.

   The top U.N. representative to Namibia
should be replaced because the U.N. has mishandled the territory's
transition to a free state, a leader of the Namibian independence
movement said today.
   Battles between South African-led security forces and guerrillas
of the South-West Africa People's Organization raged again today,
military officials said. They said South African warplanes have
been used for the first time.
   South Africa, Angola and Cuba planned emergency talks Saturday
aimed at preserving the U.N.-sponsored plan for Namibia's
independence. U.S. and Soviet obeserves were expected to attend the
meeting.
   Anton Lubowski, one of SWAPO's few white members, told a new
conference that the head of the U.N. operation in Namibia,
Finland's Martti Ahtisaari, should be replaced immediately.
   ``They (U.N. officials) are coming with exactly the same
arguments as South Africa that the guerrillas must be disarmed,''
Lubowski said. ``What kind of objectivity is that?
   ``It is clear they are working with the South Africans and are
in the South Africans' pocket,'' said Lubowski, a Windhoek attorney.
   Lubowski belongs to SWAPO's legal political wing and is a member
of the organization's secretariat, its administrative arm. SWAPO's
top leaders and the outlawed guerrilla operation are based abroad.
   At least 259 SWAPO guerrillas and 25 security force members have
been killed since gun battles broke out Saturday, when a cease-fire
was supposed to have taken effect, police officials said. They said
78 security force members and an undetermined number of SWAPO
fighters have been injured.
   South African Col. Japie Dreyer, briefing journalists at a
military base in the northern town of Oshakati, said four South
African Impala jet fighters were called into action Thursday for
the first time this week. The jets fired on SWAPO positions,
killing 17 people, he said. Dreyer said the guerrillas lacked radio
equipment and there was little chance they could be instructed to
retreat or surrender, as South Africa has demanded.
   South Africa claims SWAPO has sent more than 1,500 guerrillas
into northern Namibia in violation of an accord requiring the
insurgents to remain at bases at least 100 miles away in Angola.
   SWAPO leaders contend the guerrillas have been in Namibia for
some time and have no intention of leaving for Angola.
   However, Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, whose
country has hosted the guerrillas for 23 years, criticized SWAPO
leaders for the incursion into Namibia.
   ``I regret the SWAPO leadership was not able to exercise total
control over its guerrillas at the critical moment of the start of
(U.N.) Resolution 435, by stopping anyone crossing the
Angolan-Namibian frontier,'' dos Santos said Thursday in Luanda.
   Some U.N. and other officials have suggested SWAPO field
commanders mistakenly thought their units could return unmolested
to Namibia as of April 1 and set up bases. Several captured
guerrillas say they returned to Namibia in search of U.N. personnel
and didn't expect to fight with security forces.
   Members of the six Frontline states, a southern Africa regional
bloc, have offered to send troops to reinforce the U.N. forces, the
Angolan state news agency ANGOP reported today. There was no word
from the United Nations.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, has
threatened to suspend the U.N. independence plan for that country
if the crisis is not resolved. But South Africa's foreign minister,
Pik Botha, said Thursday that South Africa remained committed to
the plan.
   He said South Africa was receiving an unprecedented degree of
international support and was likely to benefit by being spared
further economic sanctions. SWAPO's international image had been
weakened, he said.
   The South African Council of Churches, led by prominent
anti-apartheid clergymen, said Thursday that ``the carnage of the
last few days'' could have been prevented if the United Nations had
denied South Africa's request to let its forces leave their bases
to combat the guerrillas. The church council said the credibility
of the U.N. peacekeeping force was now in doubt.
   Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the U.N. contingent,
said the United Nations hoped to have its first infantry battalions
in the northern battle areas by early next week. On Wednesday, the
United Nations accepted a U.S. offer to airlift a battalion of
about 850 Finnish soldiers to Namibia.
   The United Nations has authorized 4,650 troops for the Namibia
operation, but only 921 have arrived. The only forces in the north
are 300 logistical personnel.

   Planes landing at the Lebanon Regional
Airport are using the Federal Aviation Administration's new class
of microwave landing systems, the first of 250 to be installed by
the FAA around the country.
   ``It's much simpler, it doesn't take as much space on the
ground, and we hope it's going to be even more accurate than the
old'' instrument-landing system, Harold Buker, the state
aeronautics director, said Thursday after the FAA inaugurated the
Microwave Landing System.
   ``I foresee greater reliability for airport oprerations and an
increase in safety,'' said Marcel Theberge, manager of the
city-owned airport.
   The FAA has received congressional approval to install 250
Microwave Landing Systems throughout the country in the next 10
years. The Lebanon airport was first partly because of the hilly
terrain and because landing patterns are limited, Buker said.
   ``With the old system, we can fly only one line directly into
the field,'' Buker said. ``This will let us fly in from different
directions.'' In addition to spreading out flight patterns, which
will ease noise problems, the system promises to reduce radio
interference problems that hamper growth in the old
instrument-landing systems; and to increase airport landing
capacity.
   While the Lebanon installation was the first by the FAA, the
system has been in use at a handful of private airports around the
country.
   Authorities expect it will be a least a decade before airplanes
routinely operate with the new type of radio beacon, which uses
microwaves or precise guiding onto runways in bad weather.
   The major airlines have not endorsed the system, but have agreed
to a cooperative study with the FAA. Airline officials say it will
cost more than $250,000 on each airplane they equip to use it.
   The program has been welcomed by smaller commuter airlines,
which typically serve airports like Lebanon, where service can be
impeded by short runways, bad weather and hilly terrain. Lebanon is
about 60 miles north of Concord near the Vermont border.
   Theberge said the older instrument-landing systems take up four
buildings and ``quite a bit of land,'' while the new system needs
two buildings at the airport.
   Lebanon Regional Airport is a commuter airport that, until
Precision Airlines temporarily halted service, had about 16 flights
a day to Boston, New York, Hartford, Conn., Albany, N.Y., and other
regional airports. Currently, Business Express is the sole airline
using the field.

<HEAD>Former Esquire Editor Who Helped Found `New Journalism' Dead at 62</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harold Hayes, the author and editor who
helped make Esquire magazine the clarion of ``The New Journalism''
in the 1960s with writers like Norman Mailer and James Baldwin, has
died. He was 62.
   Hayes, who suffered a brain tumor, died Wednesday at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said Paula Correia, a hospital
spokesman.
   As editor of Esquire from 1963 to 1973, Hayes helped many
notable writers establish themselves, including Gay Talese, Tom
Wolfe and Michael Herr.
   He and then-managing editor Clay Felker laid the foundation for
what would become known as ``The New Journalism'' by asking such
literary titans as Mailer, Baldwin and William Styron to report and
write on contemporary social and political events.
   ``Esquire magazine was saved in the 1960s by its constituency of
writers,'' Hayes wrote in 1979. ``In our best moments those of us
who worked there clung to the faith that a writer's conciousness,
in whatever direction it is beamed, is the only thing truly
interesting about a magazine.''
   Hayes wrote a book in 1977 called ``The Last Place on Earth,''
which described the ecology of East Africa and the Serengeti Plain.
At his death he was working on a biography of gorilla researcher
Dian Fossey, whose life was portrayed in the movie ``Gorillas in
the Mist,'' said Tom Christie, who was helping Hayes with his
research.
   In addition to his wife, Judy Kessler, Hayes was survived by two
children from a previous marriage, a granddaughter; his brother,
James M. Hayes Jr. of Winston-Salem, and sister, Phyllis Johnson of
Rock Hill, S.C.

   Divers today searched for 20 sailors
missing and believed drowned when their Maltese-flagged freighter
sank in the Persian Gulf, maritime officials said.
   One body floated to the surface today near where the freighter
Rahim III sank off the United Arab Emirates. The body was airlifted
to Abu Dhabi and not immediately identified.
   The ship's agent, Fathi Khalil, told the Qatar News Agency that
all crew members were believed drowned.
   In addition to the Indian captain, the crew of the 2,958-ton
vessel included seven Indians, four Burmese and eight Filipinos.
   Col. Abdallah Mullah, head of the United Arab Emirates coast
guard, said he ordered divers to search for bodies when the sunken
ship was found Wednesday 60 miles from Abu Dhabi. Rough weather has
hampered the search, he said.
   Shipping excutives said the vessel, owned by the Hong Kong-based
United Ship Management Co. and carrying a load of scrap metal from
Qatar to Bombay, India, might have run into a storm or hit a
floating mine. It was reported missing Saturday.
   During the eight-year Iran-Iraq war at least 540 neutral
commercial ships were damaged in attacks or by mines. Shipping
officials fear as many as 200 mines remain in gulf waters.

<HEAD>Man Who Shot Family, Believing They'd Forgot Father's Day, Goes Free</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EATON RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly man who mistakenly
believed he'd been forgotten on Father's Day and shot six
relatives, killing two of them, now lives in an adult care home
with no restrictions on his movements.
   Melville Henwood, 81, killed his daughter and son-in-law,
Elizabeth and John Flory, and wounded his wife and three of his
grandchildren on June 8, 1986. He apparently didn't realize
Father's Day was a week away.
   Henwood was found innocent by reason of insanity in the
shootings on Oct. 26, 1987, and placed in a psychiatric hospital.
   However, he went free in February after administrators at a
second hospital to which he had been transferred allowed him to
sign a voluntary commitment order, ending what had been stringent
court control of his case. The administrators said they concluded
that he was well enough to handle a less-restrictive setting.
   ``It's one of those things that went wrong. He's as free as you
are. We don't have any control over him,'' said Dr. Lynn Blunt,
clinical director of the Michigan Center for Forensic Psychiatry in
Ypsilanti.
   Henwood shot his relatives after they had gathered for Sunday
dinner in the Florys' home, where his ailing wife, Edna, was
living. In a tape recording made the night before the shootings,
Henwood complained about being lonely and forgotten on Father's Day.
   Mrs. Henwood was critically wounded but recovered, as did his
grandchildren, Michael Flory, then 9; Christine Flory, then 12; and
Gayle Scott, then 15. Two other grandchildren, Christopher Scott
and Audra Scott, weren't at home. The Scotts are Mrs. Flory's
children by a previous marriage.
   The children still live in the house where their parents were
shot. Christopher Scott said none of them would discuss their
grandfather's release.
   Eaton County Prosecutor G. Michael Hocking started asking
questions when a sheriff's deputy gave a ride home to an old man he
met March 24 in an Eaton Rapids market. The man introduced himself
as Mel Henwood.
   ``It's kind of scary. It's especially scary when you think that
Father's Day is getting closer,'' Hocking said.
   Under Michigan law, people who sign voluntary commitment papers
void their court-ordered treatment. That's what Henwood did, Blunt
said, adding, ``We were very surprised when they allowed him to
sign the voluntary order.''
   However, Tom DeLoach, a spokesman for the state Department of
Mental Health, said Ypsilanti Regional Psychiatric Hospital
staffers determined that Henwood was ready to go into a community
program. He's still getting outpatient mental health care, DeLoach
said.
   Given the verdict, Henwood's mental health treatment must be
viewed as entirely separate from his criminal trial, DeLoach said.
   An employee at the facility where Henwood is staying refused to
let him be interviewed, saying it would upset him.
   Hocking can't prosecute Henwood on the same 12 felony charges
that stemmed from the shootings but is looking into his release. If
there's no legal recourse, he said, he wants the law changed.

<HEAD>Parliament Legalizes Solidarity, Approves Constitutional Changes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with Parliament lifting ban, approving reforms.
No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament today lifted the seven-year ban
on the Solidarity trade movement and enacted constitutional changes
to give Poland the first freely elected legislative body in the
East bloc.
   The Sejm, or parliament, passed a package of six bills that
enact into law a historic agreement on political, economic and
trade union reforms reached Wednesday between the Solidarity-led
opposition and communist authorities.
   Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, who suppressed the Soviet
bloc's only independent labor movement when he imposed martial law
in December 1981, looked on as the votes were taken.
   In a surprise move, independent Deputy Ryszard Bender proposed
that the Sejm restore the state's official name to ``The Republic
of Poland'' instead of ``The Polish People's Republic'' adopted
when communists took over after World War II. ``If we don't pass
this change today, the next Sejm ... will,'' said Bender, saying
the present name had been ``imposed'' during the Stalinist era.
   After a recess in which he consulted with parliament leaders,
Bender agreed to withdraw his motion and let it be referred to a
special commission to consider further changes in the constitution.
   Then the Sejm passed the constitutional changes 384 to 4, with
17 abstentions, and the new law on trade unions 339 to 4 with 43
abstentions.
   Also passed in short order was the new law on elections to the
Sejm, by 371-3 with 15 absentions; elections to a new Senate, by
358-7 with 25 abstentions; on the right to form associations,
304-14 with 71 abstentions; and on legalizing farmers' unions,
enabling the existence of Rural Solidarity, 326-8 with 53
abstentions.
   The accord signed by the Solidarity-led opposition and the
government resulted from two months of intense talks.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Thursday called the agreement a
``political victory'' but warned it could be disastrous if Poles do
not quickly use it to improve the economy and elect effective
representatives.
   The approval came with the blessing of Gen. Jaruzelski, who
threatened to resign as party leader in January if the party did
not restore the union.
   The general argued that legalization will culminate his policy
of national reconciliation and open the way to a united effort to
combat Poland's pressing economic and social problems.
   The new laws also provide for elections in June that will be the
freest ever held in the communist country.
   The 460 Sejm seats will be divided into two groups, with the
Communist Party and its allies guaranteed 65 percent. The remainder
go to independent candidates.
   Also, a democratically elected Senate with 100 members will be
created. For the first time, communist candidates will face direct
electoral competition from anti-communists.
   Anyone who collects 3,000 signatures can run for one of two
seats from each of the 49 provinces, with one extra seat apiece for
Warsaw and Katowice cities.
   The Senate will be able to veto legislation of the Sejm, and the
Sejm must muster a two-third majority to override the veto.
   Senate and Sejm together will form a National Assembly that will
select a president with executive and veto powers who can dissolve
parliament during a constitutional crisis. The new post seems to
have been designed for Jaruzelski as a guarantee that Poland will
stay in the Communist bloc.
   Walesa said he expected Solidarity to attract 5 million to 7
million members, but would like at least three competing unions.
   Authorities proposed talks with the opposition in August during
the year's second nationwide wave of strikes.
   Both sides hope the agreement will help repair an economy
debilitated by a $39 billion foreign debt and revive the dispirited
population.

<TEXT>
   A Chinese dissident arrived in Hong Kong today
after being held by police for nearly two days, and his wife said
he had in effect been expelled from the country.
   ``They said it was voluntary but it amounted to (expulsion),''
Jenny Holdaway, a British citizen, said in Beijing. She said her
husband, Chen Jun, had no Hong Kong visa and was being held in
transit at the Hong Kong airport.
   A Hong Kong government spokesman said Chen arrived in Hong Kong
today on his way to the United States.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified further under official
practice, declined to give any more information on Chen, saying it
was not government policy to comment on the movement of passengers.
   Ms. Holdaway said Chen was taken into police custody on
Wednesday when he arrived in Shanghai on a visit from Beijing. He
was allowed to call her this morning to say he was flying to Hong
Kong.
   ``I asked what the reason was, and he said he'd tell me later,''
she said. ``He said he was in the police station.''
   She said Chen, who holds a U.S. residency permit, had planned to
leave for the United States in several weeks. But she said he would
not have chosen freely to leave so abruptly.
   An official at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office, who
identified himself only as Mr. Fu, said Chen left voluntarily.
   But, he added, ``If (Chen) wants to come back to China it will
have to be approved by the relevant departments.'' Fu said he did
not know if Chen would be allowed back.
   Chen, 31, part owner of a Beijing bar, was one of the organizers
of a petition circulated in Beijing that called for an amnesty for
political prisoners.
   The petition, sent in February to the legislature and the ruling
Communist Party, was signed by 33 intellectuals, including some of
China's most famous writers and thinkers.
   The petition inspired more than 100 other intellectuals in China
and thousands of ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United
States to sign similar appeals. Seven Hong Kong intellectuals
brought one petition with 24,000 signatures into the country in
March but it was seized by customs officials.
   Authorities have said China has no political prisoners and that
there is no need for any amnesty. They also have denounced the
petitions as efforts to arouse foreign public opinion to bring
pressure on China.
   Chen also helped publish a pro-democracy magazine in Shanghai in
1978. While in the United States from 1984 to 1987, he contributed
articles to the New York-based magazine China Spring while studying
in the United States.
   The Chinese government considers China Spring reactionary and
has jailed several other people connected with it.
   Fu said he did not know if Chen's sudden departure was related
to his political activism. Asked if Chen had commited political
offenses, Fu said, ``You should ask him.''

   Federal regulators, nearing the end of their
rush effort to seize control of the sickest savings and loans in
the country, have added another 38 to the list of those under
government control.
   The latest takeovers announced Thursday were in California,
Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi and Texas.
   The actions brought the number of institutions being run by
federal regulators to 215 in 31 states. Officials expect to take
over another 17 institutions within the next few weeks.
   The takeovers are being supervised by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which regulates commercial banks. The agency began
the takeover program on Feb. 7 with the aim of quickly taking
control of the sickest S&amp;Ls in order to minimize losses until
Congress appropriates the money to shut them down or sell them to
new owners.
   Members of the House Banking Committee began writing their
version of the S&amp;L bailout legislation on Thursday and were to
resume consideration of amendments next week.
   The FDIC said regulatory teams being put into the institutions
would work to minimize operating losses and ensure that the S&amp;Ls
are operated in a safe and sound manner. The agency said all the
institutions will remain open as usual and that all deposits are
guaranteed up to the $100,000 insurance limit.
   The largest of the 38 institutions taken over on Thursday was
Murray Savings Association of Dallas with assets of $1.44 billion
at the end of 1988.
   The 38 institutions included:
   CALIFORNIA: Cabrillo Savings Bank, Hayward; Founders Savings and
Loan Association, Los Angeles; Royal Oak Savings and Loan
Association, Manteca; Unified Savings Association, Northridge; City
Federal Savings and Loan Association, Oakland; First California
Federal Savings Association, Orange; Arrowhead Pacific Savings
Bank, San Bernardino; Gateway Savings Bank, San Francisco;
Perpetual Savings Association, Santa Ana; Washington Savings sand
Loan Association, Stockton; Independence Savings and Loan
Association, Vallejo; City Savings and Loan Association, Westlake
Villa.
   COLORADO: American Federal Savings and Loan Association of
Colorado, Denver; Equity Federal Savings Bank of Denver.
   IOWA: Sioux Valley Savings and Loan Association, Cherokee; 1st

<HEAD>Wright Says Revelations About Bush Role Should Not Damage Bipartisanship</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Revelations about President Bush's role in
covert support for the Nicaraguan Contras should not be allowed to
damage evolving bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy between
Congress and the White House, House Speaker Jim Wright said today.
   ``We're not going to permit anything that happened in the past
to interfere with what happens in the future,'' Wright, D-Texas,
told reporters following a speech in which he extolled
bipartisanship in U.S. policy toward Central America.
   ``That does not imply approval, or sanction'' of Bush's role as
a go-between in supplying the Nicaraguan rebels, disclosed in a
document released Thursday at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial,
Wright said.
   But he added: ``I don't think it's productive ... to allow
anything to prevent our going forward and building a basis for a
truly bipartisan approach in the future.
   ``I am determined that I'm going to proceed on the basis of
trust in what President Bush and Secretary (of State James) Baker
say to me. It's a new day, and we've turned a new leaf, written a
new chapter. We mustn't allow it to be poisoned by what we read in
the last chapter.''
   In his speech to a Democratic policy group, the Center for
National Policy, Wright described the bipartisan accord on policy
toward Nicaragua announced at the White House two weeks ago, and
said legislation extending ``humanitarian'' aid to the rebels would
be passed by the House before the end of the month.
   The new aid package, totaling $58 million, includes $49 million
to maintain the current flow of food, medicine and clothing to the
rebels through February 1990, when national elections are scheduled
in Nicaragua. Details of the measure were still being worked out,
but it was scheduled to be introduced next week.
   Some snags remained to be worked out, as well, in the language
of a proposed letter from Baker to congressional leaders giving
four key committees on Capitol Hill the right to shut off the aid
after November if it is not being administered according to what
Wright called ``a gentlemen's agreement'' between Baker and
Congress.
   In his speech describing the aid package, Wright emphasized that
some of the money can be used to repatriate or relocate the roughly
11,000 rebels from their Honduran jungle camps along the Nicaraguan
border, and that no money would flow to any group which undertakes
offensive military action or human rights violations.
   And the speaker hailed the Bush administration's efforts to
develop ``mutual understanding and mutual trust,'' contrasting it
with President Reagan's tenure.
   ``We have confidence that in the Bush administration there will
be no covert mining of harbors, no publishing of assassination
manuals and no lying to Congress,'' Wright said.
   Reagan's approach o Nicaragua, including covert aid to the
rebels, ``so poisoned the well of public discourse that it made an
enormous emotional impact both at home and throughout the world,''
he said.

   Two dozen black mayors gathered for a
national convention urged random drug testing of public workers and
officials, including themselves.
   One of the 24 mayors, Callie Mobley of Allerton, Ill., said at a
news conference Thursday that she was tested last year along with
her city's 16 employees.
   ``We must step out front by taking drug tests ourselves to let
our constituents know that we're really against drugs,'' Mobley
said.
   She said Allerton, a city of 3,000, has a new policy calling for
drug testing. All the test results were negative, she said.
   There are 306 black mayors in the nation; 200 are attending the
meeting of the National Conference of Black Mayors.
   Atlantic City Mayor James Usry, president of the conference,
said all city officials should be required to take drug tests on a
random basis.
   ``We need to stop sending the message to young people that
because you're poor it's all right to sell drugs,'' said
Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode. ``That's nonsense.''
   Also Thursday, a panel of health care experts said black mayors
and church leaders should do more about fighting AIDS in the black
community by pushing for more education, treatment and research
money.
   ``I don't know where we'll bury all of them,'' Dr. Beny Primm, a
New York City addiction specialist who served on the federal AIDS
commission, said of AIDS victims.
   ``I don't think we as ... African-Americans have done very much
to turn this thing around in our communities,'' Primm said. ``We do
not have a blitzkrieg of information, a bombardment of our
community with information.''

<TEXT>
   Raisa Gorbachev argued with Sotheby's chairman
today about who really painted a portrait of the Russian Czar Peter
III which was presented it to her as a gift to the Soviet Union.
   But it was a friendly disagreement between the wife of the
visiting Soviet president and Lord Gowrie, chairman of the fine art
auction house over whether the long-missing 18th century painting
was by the court artist Alexander Rokotov. ``It really doesn't
belong to Rokotov himself, it's from the school of him,'' Mrs.
Gorbachev said during the presentation at the Soviet embassy.
   Gowrie said Sotheby's had been assured by a Soviet museum the
painting was by Rokotov. Mrs. Gorbachev replied: ``Sometimes it's
difficult for experts to establish firmly.''
   But she said she was delighted anyway at receiving the picture,
the only painting of the czar that the Russians do not have.
   ``Thank you Lord Gowrie for the presentation, that is from the
bottom of our hearts. We take it as a sign of respect for our
country, our nation and our national culture,'' said Mrs. Gorbachev.
   The czar, born in 1728, was the father of Catherine the Great.
He was assassinated in 1762 by two of his imperial officers.
   The portrait, which Sotheby's experts said showed the czar at
the age of 19, was missing for nearly 50 years. It surfaced in
London, and Sotheby's bought the picture for 7,000 pounds ($12,000)
in April.
   The original 1861 manuscript of the novel ``Fathers and Sons''
by Ivan Turgenev also was handed over to the Soviets today,
Sotheby's said.
   The Soviets bought it for roughly 500,000 pounds ($850,000)
through a private sale arranged by the auction house. The
unidentified British seller's wish had been that the manuscript
should return to its own country.

   The owner of a decaying residential hotel was
sentenced to live in his own rat-infested building for 100 days,
the longest such sentence ever imposed on a convicted Los Angeles
slumlord, authorities said.
   Amiya K. Goswami, 54, was ordered Thursday to stay inside the
four-story hotel near MacArthur Park 24 hours a day beginning April
13. If repairs are not made by July 25, Goswami must follow up his
hotel stay with four months in County Jail, Municipal Judge Suzanne
Person ruled.
   ``I am really pleased about this case because of the length of
time the house arrest involves,'' said Deputy City Attorney Diane
Stepheson. ``This is sending such a clear message that this kind of
thing is not going to be tolerated.''
   She said rats and roaches run freely through the 197-unit
building just west of downtown. The walls of the building are

   Text of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
address as provided by Tass, the official Soviet news agency:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I know that it is a great honor in Great Britain for a foreign
official to speak from the rostrum of London's Guildhall. I
appreciate the responsibility that I assume addressing the entire
British people.
   Speaking from this historic place with age-old traditions I want
first of all to greet the people of Britain and on behalf of my
people to express respect for the nation that has given the world
great authors, scientists, artists, historians and philosophers
without whom European culture would be inconceivable; the nation of
famous seafarers, inventors, workers and engineers without whom
modern civilization would be inconceivable, the nation whose
political experience has enriched the history of the world.
   Speaking from this rostrum I state with satisfaction that
important positive changes are taking place in relations between
our two countries. Our relations are gaining in trust. I believe
that their prospects are good.
   This building itself, which is reminiscent of so many events,
evokes the thought of history. The 20th century is drawing to a
close. It has been rich in tumultuous events and has truly marked a
turning point in the history of the entire human civilization.
   It must be a rare person who is not wondering today: where do we
go from here? What lies beyond that watershed?
   In recent years the awareness of the crucial nature of our time
has become universal. It is associated with hope but is also ridden
with alarm.
   The world community stands at the crossroads of two policies.
One, speaking generally, is a policy of force. It is rooted in the
past.
   The other policy is only now being shaped. It is sustained by
the rapid process of the crystallization of the world's integrity
and interdependence. The priority of universal human interests and
values is its imperative.
   Only very recently Soviet people have seen its highest
expression in the solidarity shown by the world in response to the
earthquake in Armenia.
   We sincerely thank the government and people of Great Britain,
all its citizens, who took our misfortune to heart, expressed
sympathy and gave us support.
   The present generation of political leaders are shouldering the
burden of crucial choices, the burden of making momentous
decisions. None of them has the moral right to shirk that
responsibility.
   We in the Soviet Union began by looking at ourselves. Four years
ago in April 1985 we made a choice, asking ourselves the most
difficult questions. We have tried to answer them honestly and
straightforwardly. We have set out to reappraise our experience,
our history, the world around us and our own position in it.
   We have firmly opted for overcoming ossified dogmas and stale
patterns of thinking and stereotypes. This has produced perestroika
and the new thinking and the domestic and foreign policies based on
them.
   Happening in a country like the U.S.S.R., this has evoked
extraordinary interest everywhere and has had an impact on the
international atmosphere and the realities of the political
situation in the world.
   Our perestroika is the subject of hundreds of books, thousands
of articles, official reports and academic studies, of debates at
seminars and conferences and of radio and television broadcasts.
   Today, the interest in our perestroika is not diminishing. And,
as I understand, you want to hear from me what is the situation
now, how will perestroika develop further and what are its chances
of success.
   Well, our perestroika is in earnest and for the long term. There
is no turning back for anyone. The people have firmly linked their
destiny with perestroika.
   The election of people's deputies of the U.S.S.R., which was
held in a democratic atmosphere unprecedented in our entire
history, has demonstrated that Soviet people are not going to turn
off the path chosen four years ago.
   The battle of feelings and views, the upsurge of interest in
public and government affairs, the desire to make the most of
glasnost and to protect it, the variety of conflicting opinions and
proposals and the concern that words should not again be at
variance with deeds _ all this reflects both the fundamental gains
of our perestroika and the massive support that it enjoys.
   The Communist Party of the Soviet Union received in this
election powerful support of the people.
   We launched perestroika with our eyes open. We foresaw the
complexity and the special nature of the process, realizing that it
would shake up thoroughly our entire society.
   We were not wrong about what counts most. It is also true,
however, that the magnitude of many domestic problems _ political,
economic, social and moral _ was not evident at once but revealed
itself as the process moved on. That calls for fresh approaches and
solutions and most intense intellectual and practical work.
   As for the difficulties _ and they do exist _ we accept them as
a natural expression of contradictions inherent in a transition
period.
   None of these difficulties indicate that the concept itself of
perestroika is wrong. They only accentuate the watershed character
of the period we are going through, when the old ways are still
alive and cannot be done away with overnight while new approaches
are as yet unable to pick up full speed.
   In this situation problems and difficulties are unavoidable. For
it involves far-reaching changes in everything _ in the way of life
and in the attitude toward work and civic duty.
   We have chosen, definitively and irrevocably, the route leading
to new forms of life _ democratizing our society in all spheres.
   We are convinced that it will create and is already creating
conditions for full self-expression of the individual and freedom
of thought, and that it alone will make it possible to develop the
values inherent in socialism such as social protection, justice and
humanism in production and human relations.

   In so doing, we set our sights on the highest standards of
glasnost and keeping people informed _ both those that are accepted
internationally and those that stem from our own ideals and
cultural and historical traditions.
   We are convinced that only through democratization is it
possible to build a well-functioning, healthy and dynamic economy.
Radical economic reform, which blends together planned regulation
and the market, will help us devise a new economic mechanism,
harmonize the numerous forms of socialist ownership and economic
activities, and give ample room to producers' initiative and
enterprise.
   We have formulated a new agrarian policy, seeking to tear down
the administrative-command system in agriculture; various forms of
leasing help to restore the status of farmer-peasant, his right to
be in control of land, machinery and the product of his work.
   The decisions adopted are of fundamental importance not only for
agriculture, but also for the social and economic development of
our country as a whole and even for the concept of our society's
development.
   Despite the exceptional changes that our society has undergone
in the last four years, despite the obvious fact that we are
already living in a different intellectual and political climate,
moving at a different historical pace, we still believe that this
is only the beginning of the road for us. Perestroika takes time,
patience, perseverance and consistent pursuit.
   We are aware that tests and trials are still ahead for us. We
are faced with problems resulting from a lack of political culture
and the imperfection of mechanisms that safeguard democracy and
protect it against destructive, anti-social actions.
   And weakness is impermissible here also because it can slow down
the process of democratization itself.
   We have a great deal to do in the sphere of inter-ethnic
relations. We shall do that while adjusting our federation to the
processes that are under way in Soviet society.
   Our fundamental principle of a strong center and strong
republics reflects the will of all our peoples.
   Reforming our political system is a powerful tool for tackling
all those problems and implementing all our initiatives.
   We are building an open, democratic and free society which has
learned the lessons of its past, a society based on law and
responsibility, a society that keeps its citizens well informed,
that rests on its citizens' initiative and enterprise, on Soviet
socialist patriotism and dedication to humane socialism aimed at
elevating the human being.
   Perestroika in the Soviet Union is a far-reaching and
fundamental process that responds above all to the needs of our
country's internal evolution. However, it also mirrors changes
typical of the modern world in general. Self-isolation is alien to
the very nature of perestroika.
   At the same time we note with satisfaction that it is making a
positive impact on the international scene. The democratization of
Soviet society proceeds together with the process of setting
democratic standards of openness in international affairs.
   The policy of building a state based on the rule of law in our
country coincides with the trend toward enhancing the role of law
in relations between states.
   Our economic reform presupposes the Soviet Union's closer
integration into the world economy and may be conducive to building
a truly global market and a new world economic order.
   In recent years we have seen the emergence of real opportunities
to close the last page of post-war history and enter into a new
period of peace.
   Reliance on force is a dangerous approach, which leads to an
impasse. The realities of today have laid bare the failure of the
philosophy of confrontation.
   The decades of the Cold War have cost too dearly, both to east
and to west. Continuation of all-out confrontation may spell
catastrophe for all.
   This is the objective logic of world politics at its present
stage. Our new political thinking is governed by its laws.
   Its fundamentals and practical conclusions in summarized form
were outlined at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
   Let me just recall that it sets forth the fundamental long-term
course of Soviet foreign policy and a blueprint for specific
measures for the transition to a period of peace.
   We invite everyone to dialogue and interaction for the sake of
survival and progress.
   One can read in the newspapers every day about the various
dangerous and pressing problems facing mankind. I would only point
out a simple fact which is sometimes overlooked _ all of them are
interrelated.
   It is impossible to cut this knot with a single stroke, but it
can be untied. We cannot put off this common task.
   We shall not be able to ensure genuine and substantial
disarmament unless we make concurrent radical changes in the
political climate on our planet.
   We shall not be able to save the environment unless we embark on
the path of disarmament and releasing resources to solve
environmental problems.
   We shall not be able to make the situation throughout the world
healthier unless we change the nature of north-south relations.
   We shall not be able to eliminate famine in the world, combat
drugs, AIDS and terrorism or put an end to gross violations of the
rights of individuals and entire nations until we recognize that
all that is our common concern, until we rise above the narrow
egoistical understanding of our interests and draw up guidelines
for international interaction in keeping with the needs of today.
   Recent experience testifies to the possibility of a peaceful
order based on the principles of freedom of choice and balance of
interests in the context of reducing weapons arsenals and lowering
the level of military confrontation. We will continue to prove this
with our deeds.

   A judge today sentenced mob boss Nicodemo
``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and seven associates to life in prison
instead of death for killing a fellow gangster.
   Judge Eugene Clarke took the sentencing decision away from the
jury Thursday after ruling that prosecutors failed to show there
were enough aggravating circumstances for a death sentence.
   The eight men, all convicted Wednesday in the July 1985 slaying
of Frank ``Frankie Flowers'' D'Alfonso, were formally sentenced
today. With death ruled out by the Thursday ruling, the only choice
available to the judge was to give the eight life in prison with no
chance of parole.
   Friends and relatives of the eight broke out in applause as the
judge announced his decision Thursday.
   Scarfo, 60, who is the head of organized crime in the
Philadelphia and southern New Jersey area, already is serving a
14-year sentence in a $1 million extortion case. He also faces at
least 40 more years for his conviction last November in a federal
racketeering case.
   While expressing relief that their clients were avoiding the
death penalty, defense lawyers said they would appeal the murder
convictions. Clarke set a hearing on post-trial motions, including
requests for a new trial, for July 26.
   ``I just feel like I've been pulled out the grave,'' said Robert
Simone, Scarfo's lawyer. ``There is not doubt in my mind that this
jury, a runaway jury, would have brought in the death penalty. They
were champing at the bit to put them in the electric chair.''
   But juror Arthur Trimble, 60, said the jury totally supported
Clarke's sentencing decision.
   ``We were so happy, as a group, that the judge took it out of
our hands,'' he said. ``We were not after the death penalty.''
   During the sentencing phase of the trial Thursday, police
firearms examiner John Finor testified that bystanders were
standing nearby when D'Alfonso was gunned down on a Philadelphia
street corner.
   But Clarke ruled the situation did not constitute an aggravating
circumstance necessary for the death penalty under Pennsylvania
law. He also decided not to allow prosecutors to bolster their case
for the death penalty by telling the jury about the November
racketeering convictions of Scarfo and five co-defendants.
   The jurors took only three hours Wednesday to convict Scarfo and
the others of first-degree murder, conspiracy and the possession of
an instrument of crime.
   Government witnesses said D'Alfonso was murdered because he
failed to show Scarfo proper respect.
   Besides Scarfo and Nicholas ``Nicky Whip'' Milano, 27, the
others convicted were Joseph Ligambi, 48, and Philip Narducci, 26,
identified as the shooters; Francis ``Faffy'' Iannarella, 32,
accused of supplying the two murder guns; Salvatore ``Chuckie''
Merlino, 47, and his brother, Lawrence ``Yogi'' Merlino, 32; and
Frank Narducci Jr., 31, Philip's brother.

   Mikhail Gorbachev today had lunch with
Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle and invited her to visit the
Soviet Union.
   Her office said the queen told Gorbachev she would like to
accept, but her foreign travel is fixed years in advance.
   She would be the first British sovereign to visit the Soviet
Union since the Russian royal family, her cousins, were murdered
after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
   ``Thanking Mr. Gorbachev, Her Majesty explained that the program
for her visits were fixed a number of years in advance. She hoped
it would be possible to visit the Soviet Union in due course,'' a
Buckingham Palace statement said.
   The announcement came as the Soviet leader left Windsor Castle
for London's Heathrow Airport to return home at the end of a
40-hour visit to Britain.
   Earlier, Gorbachev and his wife Raisa drove to the majestic
castle on the Thames River in drizzling rain.
   Maj. Nicholas Parsons invited the Kremlin leader in fluent
Russian to inspect a guard of honor of bearskin-capped Coldstream
Guards.
   The queen, in bright pink skirt and cape, and her husband,
Prince Philip, greeted her guests on the castle doorstep.
   Gorbachev was the first Soviet leader since 1967 to meet the
queen, and by putting the royal seal on his 40-hour visit to
Britain, he clearly hoped to enhance the benign image he is trying
to implant in Western minds.
   Windsor Castle, the palace 20 miles west of London, has been a
royal residence for more than 800 years, and the queen took the
Gorbachevs on a tour of some of its rooms and held a lunch in their
honor.
   The 34 guests, including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
her husband Denis, ate smoked salmon cornets filled with crabmeat,
layers of fillet of beef, duck puree and sliced artichoke, all
baked in pastry.
   Earlier today, Gorbachev delivered a major televised policy
speech in the oak-paneled, chandeliered splendor of Guildhall, for
800 years the seat of London city government.
   Like many of Britain's archaic institutions, the Guildhall's
power is more in its looks than in its powers. Like Queen Elizabeth
II, the Guildhall and its lord mayor are restricted largely to
ceremonial duties.
   The Gorbachevs arrived at the Guildhall in a 24-car motorcade
through the congested streets of the City, London's financial
district, where the lord mayor, Alderman Sir Christopher Collett,
waited, resplendent in black, gold-braided robes and three-corner
hat.
   Gorbachev was escorted into the building in a procession led by
the mayor, the sergeant at arms and officials bearing a sword and a
gold mace, symbol of city authority.
   A trumpet fanfare announced the Gorbachevs' entry into the hall,
and they stood beside Mrs. Thatcher and her husband Denis as the
Soviet and British anthems were played.
   An array of dignitaries packed the hall, ranging across the
political spectrum from Mrs. Thatcher through Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie to Bruce Kent, chairman of the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament.
   Pikemen, musketeers, sheriffs and city elders in blue robes
stood by to complete the pageant.

   As I have already announced, our armed forces will be reduced by
500,000 men, which is 12 percent of their total strength, during
1989-1990. The military budget will be cut by over 14 percent, and
the production of weapons by nearly 20 percent. We have already
actually started implementing this program.
   I take this opportunity to tell you that we have recently
decided to cease this year the production of enriched weapons-grade
uranium.
   In addition to the industrial reactor for the production of
weapons-grade plutonium shut down in 1987, we plan to shut down two
other such reactors this and next year without commissioning new
units to replace them. This is yet another major step towards the
complete cessation of production of fissionable materials for use
in weapons.
   The elimination of chemical weapons is a most important problem
in efforts to demilitarize international politics.
   We appreciate the position of Great Britain which has eliminated
its chemical weapons unilaterally and was the first to raise this
issue at an international conference. Our bilateral cooperation has
been quite good.
   Soviet experts have visited the British research center in
Portadown while British experts have visited our center. We have
completed the construction of a facility for the destruction of
chemical weapons and intend to invite soon your representatives to
visit it.
   The Soviet Union will be vigorously working for an early
conclusion of a global international convention on the complete
prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons.
   We have adopted several important decisions for the conversion
of our military industries. A considerable number of defense
factories and design bureaus and their related research potential
are becoming involved in manufacturing consumer goods, machinery,
equipment and other facilities and products for agriculture and the
light and food industries.
   A substantial number of military transport aircraft will be used
for carrying civilian cargoes.
   The Soviet Union has made several major steps toward
transparency of its military activities.
   We have already stated that we are going soon to make public our
defense budget data. This will be done by the new Supreme Soviet of
the U.S.S.R. The difficulty here is that the non-convertibility of
the ruble hampers an objective comparison of our military
expenditures with those of the West. We are looking for the most
appropriate way of presenting our data.
   As for the numerical strength of the armed forces, I can now say
the following. As of Jan. 1 this year, they number 4,258,000 men
including 1,596,000 in the ground forces and 437,300 in the navy,
while missile forces, air defense troops, the air force and combat
support and logistics forces account for the rest of that figure.
   After the unilateral reduction of our armed forces their total
strength by the end of 1990 will be approximately 3,760,000.
   By way of comparison, the total strength of the U.S. armed
forces including the National Guard (in our country similar
components are integrated in the armed forces) exceeds 3,000,000.
It should be noted that the strength of the U.S. Navy is more than
double that of the Soviet Union.
   We have published data on the military potentials of the Warsaw
Treaty organization and NATO in Europe. They show approximate
parity.
   The comparison between the armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty
organization and NATO as a whole, including strategic nuclear
forces, gives the following figures for the Warsaw Treaty
organization: 5.3 million men, 10,500 aircraft, 4,200 combat
helicopters, 80,000 tanks, 160 large surface ships. NATO is
superior to the Warsaw Treaty organization in all those components
with the exception of tanks.
   In short, fears about the ``Soviet military threat'' are
groundless.
   Negotiations and a search for compromise between major countries
involved in the protracted arms race would clear the way to a
reduced level of military confrontation, fewer weapons and a less
onerous burden of military expenditures.
   In this regard the Vienna document and the start of the talks on
reductions in the armed forces and armaments in Europe and on
confidence-building measures are an event without precedent in the
nuclear age. The Soviet Union is prepared to take very far-reaching
steps toward a demilitarization of Europe and in the overall
European process.
   We are prepared to engage in a most constructive dialogue and
cooperation with Great Britain concerning all matters relative to
the concluding document of the Vienna meeting.
   It is well known that we are opposed to unjustified linkages in
disarmament matters. We do not make agreement on one issue
contingent on a solution to another. But this is rather a problem
of how best to organize the negotiating process. Objectively
speaking, in our century everything is linked.
   So, of course, there can be no doubt that, if for instance, NATO
goes ahead with its program of ``modernizing'' tactical nuclear
weapons, this is bound to affect the Vienna talks,
confidence-building measures and the situation in Europe in
general. This is bound to devalue much of what has been achieved
under the INF treaty.
   In this context it is appropriate for me to recall once again
that Britain contributed to creating conditions for making the
treaty possible.
   We strongly oppose any plans for the modernization of nuclear
weapons. We are not modernizing, nor do we intend to modernize them
unless we are made to. I believe that common sense will prevail.
   We are convinced that the time has come to start negotiations on
reducing Soviet and U.S. naval forces and those of the Warsaw
treaty and the north Atlantic alliance.
   The question of 50 percent reductions in Soviet and U.S.
strategic offensive arms continues to be on top of the agenda of
our relations with the United States. We are ready to resume
negotiations at any time.

   As for the doctrine of ``nuclear deterrence,'' I believe that it
is high time that, instead of speaking of how to ``deter'' others
with nuclear weapons, we spoke of how to deter, to keep in check
nuclear weapons themselves. It means putting an end to the
accumulation and upgrading of those weapons, gradually but steadily
destroying their stockpiles and ultimately their complete
elimination and prohibition of their production.
   We believe that it is really possible to build a safe and
nuclear-free world. Undoubtedly, the road to such a world lies not
only through greater openness and reliable verification. It also
requires building confidence which depends on many aspects of
today's international affairs.
   Soviet-British relations can make a substantial contribution to
these efforts. They possess an extraordinary political and
historical potential supplemented by a factor which is becoming
increasingly important at present _ both countries are permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council. If constructively pooled
together, our efforts do not merely add up but multiply as an
international factor.
   Conferences on humanitarian questions and human rights could
produce a major breakthrough toward new frontiers in the European
process. In a few weeks' time the London Information Forum will
launch this series, and the 1991 Moscow conference will conclude it.
   We see areas of agreement in Soviet and British approaches
towards the settlement of regional conflicts. Here, too, some
experience has been gained, but what matters most is that the
leaders of both countries are prepared to explore and propose in a
calm and businesslike manner their ideas and good offices to the
parties concerned.
   We are in favor of using Soviet-British dialogue for
internationalizing the economic problems of today's world. A
conclave of several personalities, even influential ones, will not
suffice for that. All have the right to be involved in matters
which concern everyone.
   Only common efforts on the basis of equality would make it
possible to avoid disastrous upheavals in the world economy. And
such upheavals may occur if we put off our search for radical and
just solutions and rely on stop-gap measures.
   As regards environmental issues, the Soviet Union will
faithfully abide by existing agreements and cooperate in
international programs, and will soon adhere to those it is not yet
party to.
   I believe that in this area, too, many opportunities exist for
enriching Soviet-British relations.
   To conclude, I must tell you that our relations are changing for
the better.
   Both our governments have put in a lot of efforts to make this
happen.
   We duly appreciate the consistent efforts made by British Prime
Minister Mrs. Margaret Thatcher.
   Certainly, all is not so simple in politics. Substantial
differences and disagreements still exist. Problems could also
arise in implementing what was agreed upon yesterday at Downing
Street.
   However, it is my impression that we have set the right
guidelines. Horizons of trust have expanded. We have seen even more
clearly that we are able to act in the spirit of mutual
understanding and in a productive manner in upholding our national
interests within the framework of the universal values of modern
civilization.
   And the fact that we are different is an incentive for
exchanges, cooperation and dialogue between our two states and
peoples.
   It is with these feelings that we are going back to Moscow full
of impressions of your city and of the people whom we have had a
chance to meet during the brief time here.
   At the conclusion of our stay in your country we shall visit Her
Majesty the Queen.
   I would like to wish all those present in this hall, all who are
listening to me and all British families happiness, well-being and
peace.
   All the best to you. Thank you.

   The government today charged five more
Sikhs, including a former police superintendent, in the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   Investigators appointed by the government to find out who
plotted Mrs. Gandhi's murder filed 10 charges against each person,
including murder, attempted murder, criminal conspiracy, sedition
and waging or attempting to wage war against the state.
   Conviction carries a maximum punishment of death by hanging. Two
Sikhs already have been executed in the case, including one of the
bodyguards who shot Mrs. Gandhi.
   The government said the five Sikhs conspired to destabilize
India after a June 1984 army raid on the Golden Temple, the holiest
Sikh shrine.
   The former senior superintendent of police, Simranjeet Singh
Mann, resigned after the army raid. The others named were Jagmohan
Singh Tony and Dalip Singh, both college lecturers in Bombay, and
Attinder Pal Singh, one of the most notorious Sikh militants.
   Mann and Attinder Pal Singh are in custody, and officials said
warrants have been issued for Tony and Dalip Singh, who are
believed to be in Bombay.
   The fifth Sikh named in the charges, Rattan Singh, was killed by
rival Sikh militants in 1985, the government said.
   None of the Sikhs were related. All Sikh males take the name
Singh, which means lion in the Punjabi language.
   The Indian Express, the country's largest selling
English-language newspaper, today reported the five Sikhs
established contact with Mrs. Gandhi's two known assassins through
Balbir Singh, a Sikh employed in the prime minister's security
network.
   However, the newspaper said, Balbir Singh could not be charged
again because he was acquitted of conspiracy charges in the
assassination by the Supreme Court last August.
   Balbir Singh was earlier found guilty and sentenced to hang by a
trial court, but the Supreme Court overturned the conviction for
lack of evidence.
   Mrs. Gandhi was gunned down by two Sikh bodyguards in the garden
of her New Delhi residence on Oct. 31, 1984. One of the assassins
was shot and killed by other bodyguards and the other was convicted
and hanged on Jan. 6.
   A third Sikh, Kehar Singh, was convicted on conspiracy charges
and also hanged Jan. 6.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's population. Sikh militants,
who claim discrimination by the Hindu majority, have been fighting
since 1982 for a separate nation.

   A Cuban gunboat fired warning shots at a Florida
fishing boat and then seized the vessel early today at the edge of
international water off the northeastern tip of the island nation,
officials said.
   A Jacksonville marine company monitoring radio reported hearing
a mayday call from the 66-foot Don Pepo before it was boarded at
4:50 a.m., said Coast Guard Petty Officer Luis Diaz.
   The boat's crew said by radio that the Cubans had fired warning
shots when the Don Pepo was about 12 miles off the coast. No
injuries were reported.
   Crew members Mike Frye and Claude Pawell of St. Augustine said
they were headed from Tampa to Cartagena, Colombia, when the boat
was boarded and that they were ordered to follow the gunboat to the
Cuban port of Cayo Moa.
   The Coast Guard said it received no response from the Cuban
government about the incident.

   The Soviet Union said today that U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III will visit Moscow on May 10-11.
   The official Tass news agency announced the dates of Baker's
first visit to Moscow as secretary of state in a one-sentence
statement.
   ``It has been officially announced here that under an agreement
that has been reached U.S. Secretary of State James Baker will pay
an official visit to Moscow on May 10-11, 1989,'' Tass said.
   That will be just days before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
goes to China for the first Soviet-Chinese summit in 30 years.
   The Soviet Ambassador to Washington, Yuri Dubinin, announced in
early March that Baker would visit Moscow this spring. During a
meeting in Vienna five days later, Baker and Shevaradnadze said the
visit would take place in May but did not announce a date.
   Baker and Shevardnadze said in Vienna that one reason for the
trip would be to discuss a possible summit meeting between
Gorbachev and President Bush, but Baker said then the United States
was not prepared to set a date for a summit.

   President Bush today deflected complaints by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the U.S. review of arms
control and foreign policy was delaying negotiations to slow the
nuclear arms race.
   ``We are making a prudent review,'' Bush said. ``... Mr.
Gorbachev knows there is no foot-dragging going on, and I`m not
concerned in the least.''
   Gorbachev, on a visit to Britain, said through a spokesman on
Thursday that ``continuity is the name of the game. We are a little
bit apprehensive we could be losing it.''
   Bush, with a flash of irritation in a session in the White House
press room, said he would be ready to discuss the arms situation
with the Soviets when the review is completed. That is expected at
the end of the month or, at the latest, in early May.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will go to Moscow next
month to discuss the suspended negotiations with the Soviets and
also prospects for a first summit meeting between Bush and
Gorbachev.
   The negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear weapons went into
recess in December and were tentatively set to resume in
mid-February. But the Bush administration postponed the resumption
for the review, which includes an analysis of U.S. nuclear forces.
   On a related subject, Gorbachev promised today to make deep cuts
in the Soviet military and announced he would close two more
nuclear reactors that produce weapons-grade plutonium.
   Asked for his appraisal, Bush again deflected the question. ``We
will react when we are ready to react,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Bush called developments in Poland ``mind-boggling''
because of the pace of reform. ``I think it is a sign of the change
of democratization. ... This is all very encouraging.''
   He said he had not decided whether he should consider a visit to
the East European country.

<HEAD>Riots Break Out In Iran After Khomeini Dismisses Montazeri As Successor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riots broke out in the hometown of Iran's
Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri after his dismissal as designated
successor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the main Iranian
opposition group said today.
   The Baghdad-based Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors,
said a number of people died in the clashes between civilians and
soldiers in Najafabad in central Isfahan province.
   In a statement sent to The Associated Press office in Nicosia,
the group said residents, chanting ``Down with Khomeini!'' had
taken arms from the soldiers and returned their fire. The group
said the clashes started Sunday and continued through Wednesday.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said today that
Montazeri wrote to the city's residents asking them ``to thwart any
action against the Islamic Republic that might be taken in his
name.'' But IRNA, which was monitored in Nicosia, did not say a
riot had occurred in Najafabad.
   Montazeri, who in recent weeks openly criticized the
shortcomings of the 10-year-old Islamic revolution and called for
greater freedom, stepped down March 28 after Khomeini wrote him a
letter telling him to quit.
   Khomeini's decision to dump the 64-year-old cleric was seen as
part of a crackdown on more moderate members of the senior Iranian
leadership.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq report, telexed to The Associated Press in
Nicosia, said Najafabad was under curfew and authorities had set up
traffic checkpoints. It reported numerous arrests in the
disturbances in Najafabad and other central Iranian cities of
Yazdanshahr, Amirabad and Imam.
   IRNA reported Montazeri's letter in a dispatch from Tehran in
which Iran's chief justice, Ayatollah Musavi Ardebili, denied that
Montazeri's ouster signaled that the goverment was involved in a
power struggle.
   Ardebili said at a prayer service today that he was delighted
with Montazeri's letter, IRNA reported. ``He wrote it for those who
wanted to muddy the waters,'' IRNA quoted Ardebili as saying.
   Ardebili said nothing more about the letter, IRNA reported, but
said of the ouster, ``This is not a power struggle or a
conspiracy.''
   Khomeini, 88, designated Montazeri in 1985 as his successor but
asked him to step down as part of his campaign to revive what he
called Iran's flagging revolutionary spirit.
   The chief justice said he was speaking out because some people
were asking questions about the leadership issue and the future of
the Islamic republic, IRNA said. ``There's nothing for anyone to be
worried about,'' Ardebili said.
   In his resignation letter, Montazeri had asked that his
resignation not be used to foment government opposition. ``And I
would like to ask my dear brothers and sisters not to do anything
about the great leader's decision ... using their support for me as
an excuse,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Former Wright Aide Says Speaker Asked Aides to Help Him Sell Book</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with Wright telephone call to aide, ethics panel

   House Speaker Jim Wright telephoned a former
aide last year and asked him to sign an affidavit stating that the
aide had volunteered to work on the speaker's book, ``Reflections
of a Public Man,'' according to testimony given to the ethics
committee investigating Wright's finances.
   The testimony also alleges that Wright, at a breakfast meeting
early in 1985, asked congressional aides to help set up promotional
events for the book, according to sources familiar with the
deposition of former Wright aide Matthew Cossolotto.
   Wright's directive was followed in the next month or so by book
signings at a Capitol Hill bookstore and the National Press Club, a
distribution of copies _ paid for by lobbyists _ to Democrats
attending a party conference and by an appearance on a televised
talk show.
   An aide to Wright, Mark Johnson, called Cossolotto ``a
disgruntled former employee'' but did not deny the speaker had
directed staff members to sell books.
   The ethics committee, which met behind closed doors to continue
its deliberations today, is looking into whether Wright used bulk
sales of the book to circumvent limits on outside income from
speaking and writing fees.
   Cossolotto testified to the panel that after a newspaper
reported last June that he had helped complile and edit the book,
including a three-week trip to Fort Worth to oversee final
preparation for printing, he telephoned the speaker. When Wright
called him back, he asked Cossolotto to sign an affidavit swearing
to the voluntary nature of the job assignment.
   The former aide told the committee he considered the book work
part of his official job assignment, and declined to sign the
affidavit.
   Johnson disputed that version of events, saying Cossolotto had
volunteered at first to give an affidavit, then backed out.
   Wright acknowledged Wednesday that in at least one instance _
the sale of 504 copies of the book to Southwest Texas State
University in lieu of a $3,000 speaking fee _ he had given his
assent to the deal.
   In that case, the suggestion to sell books came from a staff
member, Wright said.
   In at least one other case, the March 1986 sale of $1,000 worth
of books in lieu of a speaking fee from Mid-Continent Oil and Gas
Association, the suggestion to buy books also came from a Wright
staff aide, according to a source familiar with the transaction.
Wright was to ship the books not to the trade group, but to schools
in Texas, the source said.
   One ethics committee member, who did not wish to be identified,
cknowledged Thursday that the issue of book promotion was before
the panel, but it was unclear how serious the committee considers
that issue.
   The ethics panel is expected to reach some conclusion in its
nine-month investigation of Wright sometime next week, said
Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif. Sources have said the panel is
concentrating on the book sales and Wright's financial dealings
with his friend George Mallick, a Fort Worth real estate developer.
   As the panel resumed deliberations today, Dixon said the
contract of its special outside counsel, Richard Phelan, was being
extended through July 1.
   If the committee were to find cause to recommend sanctions
against Wright, the speaker would have 21 days to respond under the
panel's rules. Then the committee would have an additional 30 days
to decide whether to recommend disciplinary action to the full
House.
   A two-month extension of the contract could cover that time
period, but Dixon said ``you can't read anything into'' the request
for an extension.
   Both Dixon and Rep. John Myers, R-Ind., also said today that
committee precedent would call for eventual public release of the
full report by Phelan on all six original counts against Wright,
regardless of whether the panel agrees with them. That position
apparently is at odds with that of members of the House Democratic
leadership, who have argued the panel should release only those
parts of the report which support its conclusions.

   Atlantis' five astronauts boarded
their spaceship today in a successful countdown test for the first
space shuttle planetary mission.
   Wearing bulky space suits, the crew members for the 29th shuttle
mission entered the cabin for the final two hours of the rehearsal
to run through launch day procedures.
   The exercise ended as planned five seconds before the count
reached zero.
   ``At this point, everything appears to have gone as planned,''
said NASA spokesman Hugh Harris. A number of technical problems
were built into the countdown, ``just to ensure that we do have the
capability of both solving problems and stopping the countdown
should a problem occur on launch day.''
   The two-day countdown test, which began Thursday, duplicates
much of the actual count, except that the fuel tank is not loaded
and some procedures are shortened.
   Also being monitored was the Magellan spacecraft in the cargo
bay. After reaching orbit, the astronauts are to release this $378
million payload on a mission to map the cloud-hidden surface of the
planet Venus.
   After a 466-day outward trip, Magellan is to sweep into orbit
around Earth's nearest planetary neighbor and aim a high-powered
imaging radar at the surface. During 243 days, the radar is to send
back the sharpest images yet of much of this mysterious planet.
   NASA is aiming for an Atlantis liftoff on April 28 but admits
the schedule is tight. Shuttle managers are to meet next Friday to
set a launch date.

   President Bush firmly refused today to discuss
his role in the Reagan administration's secret plan to aid the
Contra rebels, saying he did not want to ``prejudice the trial'' of
former White House aide Oliver North.
   ``The legal process ought to run unfettered without you or me''
interfering, the president told a reporter who asked him to square
his previous statements on the affair with courtroom disclosures on
Thursday that suggested a greater role than had been known.
   Bush said the material presented to the North jury ``has been
available to'' government prosecutors and congressional
investigators previously ``and has been reviewed by them for any
special significance.'' He would not answer a questioner who quoted
Edmund Muskie _ a member of a White House investigating panel _ as
saying that some of the material looked new to him.
   ``I stand by my statement about the Iran-Contra committee,''
Bush said.
   Bush began his news conference with a statement increasing the
federal role in cleaning up the aftermath of the Alaska oil spill.
He ordered U.S. Armed forces personnel to assist in the cleanup,
saying, ``We all share the sorrow and concern of Alaskans.''
   ``Exxon's efforts standing alone are not enough,'' he said, but
emphasizing that the giant oil firm would continue to be
responsible and liable for the accident. He defended himself from
criticism that it had taken too long for him to provide federal
help to the clean-up effort.
   On other matters, Bush:
   Said he was unwilling to compromise with Democrats who seek a
larger increase in the minimum wage.
   Expressed some satisfaction with recent talks on Middle East
peace efforts.
   Defended himself from criticism by Mikhail Gorbachev that his
administration was slow to develop an initiative for arms reduction.
   Said developments in Poland were ``mind-boggling'' because of
the pace of reform. ``I think it is a sign of the change of
democratization... This is all very encouraging.''
   He said he had not decided whether he should consider a return
visit to the East European country.
   Bush announced the Alaska developments during an appearance in
the White House briefing room at which he was accompanied by
Cabinet members and Alaskan members of Congress. Questions quickly
turned to other matters, including Soviet affairs, much to Bush's
frustration.
   Concerning the Iran-Contra affair, he said the independent
counsel and congressional committees had access to the material
made public at the North trial.
   Asked what his pledge meant not to talk further on the subject,
he replied, ``It means I've said all I'm going to say about...on
the advice of lawyers.''
   ``Please accept it when I've said I'm not going to talk about it
anymore.''
   ``So nice try,'' he said to the reporter.
   He reacted brusquely when asked about Soviet suggestions that
the United States wasn't keeping pace with Soviet moves in arms
reduction. Gorbachev, on a visit to Britain, said through a
spokesman on Thursday that ``continuity is the name of the game. We
are a little bit apprehensive we could be losing it.''
   Bush said there was no delay in his administration's development
of policy regarding nuclear weapons negotiations and foreign policy.
   ``We are making a prudent review,`` Bush said. ``... Mr.
Gorbachev knows there is no foot-dragging going on, and I`m not
concerned in the least.''
   Bush also said he hoped his meetings this week with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
had produced some improvements in the peace prospects in the Middle
East. He said sometimes ``small steps'' can be important.
   Bush also emphatically refused to raise his proposal for a
higher minimum wage, despite Democratic pressure to force him to do
so.
   ``I have no intention of budging one inch on this. I have too
much at stake,'' said Bush, who appears headed for a veto
confrontation with the Democratic majorities of Congress over the
issue.
   The president opened his mid-morning news conference at the
White House with the announcement that after two weeks he had
ordered military personnel to assist in the cleanup of the
disastrous oil spill in Prince William Sound.
   Members of Alaska's congressional delegation and high-ranking
administration officials joined him at the White House press room
podium as the president predicted the effort would be ``massive,
prolonged and frustrating.''
   ``Our ultimate goal must be the complete restorationm of the
ecology and the economy of Prince William Sound including all of
its fish, marine mammals, birds and wildlife,'' Bush said.
   An Exxon oil tanker hit a well-marked reef in the sound two
weeks ago, resulting in a 10-million gallon oil spill. Bush said
his decision to deploy federal troops to help in the clean-up
operation ``should not in any way relieve Exxon from any of its
responsibilities or its liabilities.''
   In London, earlier today, Gorbachev promised deep cuts in the
Soviet military and announced he would close two more nuclear
reactors that produce weapons-grade plutonium. Asked for his
appraisal, Bush deflected the question. ``We will react when we are
ready to react,'' he said.

   On Iran-Contra, Bush said, ``I've said all I want to say about
it, because I really believe on the advice of lawyers that that's
the last thing we ought to do is even be kicking it around....So
please accept it when I said I don't want to talk about it any more
and I'm not going to.''
   Material presented to the jury at North's trial in federal court
on Thursday depicted Bush as more involved than previously believed
in the Reagan administration's secret plan to aid the Contras. Bush
went to a meeting with then-President Robert Suazo in 1985,
carrying a promise of additional U.S. aid, for example. Honduras
was supplying the Contras at the time.
   There was no indication in the courtroom material that Bush
linked the speeded up U.S. aid with the Honduran assistance for the
Contras. But in earlier testimony, former national security adviser
Robert McFarlane said the aid was part of a secret agreement
designed to funnel aid to the rebels battling the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua.
   It wasn't the first time Bush has been asked to explain his role
in the Iran-Contra affair that became the biggest scandal of the
Reagan administration.
   He faced a barrage of questions early last year during the
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination _ including one
heated exchange with CBS anchorman Dan Rather _ and then later
faced additional pressure on the subject from Democratic candidate
Michael Dukakis. Throughout, he insisted he did not know of the
diversion of funds from the sale of weapons to Iran to the Contras,
and said he had little involvement in the Contra aid effort.

   President-elect Alfredo Cristiani of El
Salvador today rejected a demand by Salvadoran rebels that he
declare his forthcoming administration a transitional government
and call for new elections.
   Cristiani's comment came at a news conference on a plan outlined
by rebel representatives on Thursday, calling for negotiations for
a ceasefire, after which elections would be held within six months.
   ``I believe this is a setback in the progress that has been made
in dialogue'' with the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, Cristiani said.
   He said it also was ``starting to show'' that the rebel faction
``does not really want peace, but rather is simply trying to play a
political game in which they are trying to pretend to be looking
for a peaceful solution but simply creating more and more obstacles
as things go along.''
   ``I would definitely not consider our government a transitional
goverment unless you put it in a five-year term,'' Cristiani said,
with the next election to be held in 1994.
   However, he said, his government will be willing to talk with
the rebels to ``try to seek a way by which they can incorporate
themselves into the process.''
   Cristiani's press conference came a few hours before a scheduled
meeting at the White House with President Bush.
   Asked whether he was satisified with the present level of U.S.
economic aid to El Salvador, Cristiani said, ``I think the aid
package in itself is reasonable. I think it is something that you
can work with. Obviously the problems are so big that we would like
to see the aid package increased, but we certainly understand the
problems that the United States has with its own budget.''
   Two young women who did not identify themselves were hustled out
of the room by security men after they rose and shouted questions
about charges linking Cristiani's Arena party to death squads.
   In response to a reporter's question about the death squads
later, the Salvadoran president-elect said such activity has been
diminishing and is the work of individuals, mostly in the armed
forces and security forces, ``taking matters into their own
hands.'' He said his government's policy would be to hold these
people responsible for their acts.
   Outside the National Press Building, where the news conference
was held, a small band of demonstrators shouted, ``Cristiani, you
can't hide. We charge you with genocide.''
   The rebel proposal also demands that U.S. aid to the Salvadoran
government be halted and U.S. military advisers withdrawn.
   ``The future government can choose between two options,'' said
Francisco Altschul, a representative of the political opposition
commission of the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
``It can be a government which will deepen the war or it can be a
government of transition towards peace.''
   The rebel plan calls for negotiations leading to a cease-fire,
after which an election would be held within six months, with
military forces of both sides barred from polling places.
Cristiani, the candidate of the right-wing Arena party, was elected
March 19 in an election which the rebels had sought to have
postponed.
   The State Department has said the United States recognizes the
results of the balloting despite the Arena party's past links to
right-wing death squad activities. U.S. officials say the death
squads are now substantially less active than they were during
their peak in the early 1980s.
   After the election, the guerrillas escalated attacks on
government installations in the 9-year-old war against the
U.S.-supported government. More than 70,000 Salvadorans, most of
them civilians, have been killed since the war began.

   Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Friday concerning the Alaskan oil spill and other issues.
   Well, I have a statement and then would be glad to take a few
questions and then refer them to our experts here. But virtually
every American is familiar with the tragic environmental disaster
in Alaskan waters. And more than 10 million gallons of oil have
been spillled with deadly results for wildlife and hardship for
local citizens.
   We all share the sorrow and concern of Alaskans and the
determination to mount a sustained cleanup effort. Our ultimate
goal must be the complete restoration of the ecology and the
economy of Prince William Sound, including all of its fish, marine
mammals, birds, and other wildlife.
   The Exxon Corp. has acknowledged responsibility for this spill
and its liability for the damages. Exxon should remain responsible
for both damages and for employing civilian personnel necessary to
control further damage. However, Exxon's efforts, standing along,
are not enough. And after consulting with a congressional
delegation _ Sen. Ted Stevens, Sen. Frank Murkowski, Congressman
Don Young _ I have determined to add additional federal resources
to the cleanup effort, in addition to the considerable federal
personnel and equipment already on the scene.
   And this new effort will focus on the job of helping recover oil
now in the water and restoring beaches and other damaged areas.
This effort should not in any way relieve Exxon from any of its
responsibilities or its liabilities. I've asked Sam Skinner, our
secretary of transportation, to serve as the coordinator of the
efforts of all federal agencies involved in the cleanup and to work
with the Alaskan authorities and Exxon.
   Adm. Paul Yost, the commandant of the Coast Guard, will return
to Alaska to assume the personal oversight of developments. As we
all know, the Coast Guard has many assets in place right now.
   Also at my direction, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will make
available U.S. armed forces personnel and equipment to assist in
the cleanup. The military will provide personnel for direct cleanup
activities, as well as assisting with logistics _ the needs of
logistics related to the cleanup. And of course, these efforts must
be undertaken carefully, so that further damage to fragile areas
will not occur. Intensive planning now going on, as well as
appropriate cleanup training, will be completed before ground units
are actually deployed.
   In addition to the Department of Defense personnel, I'd ask my
staff to develop plans to enable volunteers to participate in
cleanup activities. By summer, we hope to have developed facilities
to enable us to accommodate a corps of Alaskan volunteers. And when
I say ``develop facilities,'' these gentlemen will tell you, we're
dealing with very remote areas in some cases here.
   I've asked EPA Administrator Bill Reilly to coordinate the
long-range planning to restore the environment of the Sound. EPA
will draw on the expertise of leading scientists and oil spill
experts in this work. It'll also consult with other federal
agencies that are assessing scientific data regarding the effects
of the spill.
   We'll not forget the residents of Alaska, who have suffered
extraordinary economic loss. And, when you talk to these
congressmen, as I have, and get it brought home on a case-by-case
basis, we have to be concerned and we are concerned. In addition to
paying damage claims against it, we encourage Exxon to increase its
local hiring for the cleanup efforts. Secretary Skinner will also
work with Exxon and appropriate agencies to develop appropriate
loan assistance programs, to assist those who have suffered
economic injury.
   This situation has demonstrated the inadequacy of existing
contingency plans. And, consequently, I have directed a nationwide
review of contingency plans of this type to determine improvements
that may be necessary.
   In describing these measures, we should not be under any
illusions. The job of cleaning up the oil from both the sea and the
affected land areas will be massive, prolonged and frustrating.
Nothing we can do will totally resolve this problem in the
short-term. Rather, we must be prepared for a long, sustained
effort.
   Learning from this experience, we also rededicate ourselves to
transportation safety and to realistic planning for accidents that
do occur. At the same time, our national security interest in the
domestic energy supply should not be forgotten. The excellent
safety record that was recorded prior to this incident must be
restored and maintained consistently into the future.
   Secretary Skinner and Administrator Reilly will make brief
statements, and they, Secretary Cheney, and others will be
available to answer questions. Prior to that, let me just take a
couple of questions and then I want to keep the focus, if possible,
on this. So, fire away. Yeah?

Gorbachev's speech Friday as provided by Tass, the official Soviet
news agency:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The world community stands at the crossroads of two policies.
One, speaking generally, is a policy of force. It is rooted in the
past.
   The other policy is only now being shaped. It is sustained by
the rapid process of the crystallization of the world's integrity
and interdependence. The priority of universal human interests and
values is its imperative.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The election of people's deputies of the U.S.S.R., which was
held in a democratic atmosphere unprecedented in our entire
history, has demonstrated that Soviet people are not going to turn
off the path chosen four years ago.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We were not wrong about what counts most. It is also true,
however, that the magnitude of many domestic problems _ political,
economic, social and moral _ was not evident at once but revealed
itself as the process moved on. That calls for fresh approaches and
solutions and most intense intellectual and practical work.
   As for the difficulties _ and they do exist _ we accept them as
a natural expression of contradictions inherent in a transition
period.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Despite the exceptional changes that our society has undergone
in the last four years, despite the obvious fact that we are
already living in a different intellectual and political climate,
moving at a different historical pace, we still believe that this
is only the beginning of the road for us. Perestroika takes time,
patience, perseverance and consistent pursuit.
   We are aware that tests and trials are still ahead for us. We
are faced with problems resulting from a lack of political culture
and the imperfection of mechanisms that safeguard democracy and
protect it against destructive, anti-social actions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We are building an open, democratic and free society which has
learned the lessons of its past, a society based on law and
responsibility, a society that keeps its citizens well informed,
that rests on its citizens' initiative and enterprise, on Soviet
socialist patriotism and dedication to humane socialism aimed at
elevating the human being.

<TEXT>
   Recent experience testifies to the possibility of a peaceful
order based on the principles of freedom of choice and balance of
interests in the context of reducing weapons arsenals and lowering
the level of military confrontation. We will continue to prove this
with our deeds.
   I take this opportunity to tell you that we have recently
decided to cease this year the production of enriched weapon-grade
uranium.
   In addition to the industrial reactor for the production of
weapons-grade plutonium shut down in 1987, we plan to shut down two
other such reactors this and next year without commissioning new
units to replace them. This is yet another major step towards the
complete cessation of production of fissionable materials for use
in weapons.

<TEXT>
   We have already stated that we are going soon to make public our
defense budget data. This will be done by the new Supreme Soviet of
the USSR. The difficulty here is that the non-convertibility of the
ruble hampers an objective comparison of our military expenditures
with those of the West. We are looking for the most appropriate way
of presenting our data.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In this regard the Vienna document and the start of the talks on
reductions in the armed forces and armaments in Europe and on
confidence-building measures are an event without precedent in the
nuclear age. The Soviet Union is prepared to take very far-reaching
steps toward a demilitarization of Europe and in the overall
European process.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   So, of course, there can be no doubt that, if for instance, NATO
goes ahead with its program of `modernizing' tactical nuclear
weapons, this is bound to affect the Vienna talks,
confidence-building measures and the situation in Europe in
general. This is bound to devalue much of what has been achieved
under the INF treaty.
   In this context it is appropriate for me to recall once again
that Britain contributed to creating conditions for making the
treaty possible.
   We strongly oppose any plans for the modernization of nuclear
weapons. We are not modernizing, nor do we intend to modernize them
unless we are made to. I believe that common sense will prevail.

<TEXT>
   A man filed a wrongful death suit against the city
on behalf of his estranged wife and had ``her'' body buried in a
pauper's grave but his wife _ one of two _ is still alive and
police are trying to identify the body.
   Jacquelyn Brown, 34, of Arkansas, told police she last spoke to
her husband, Robert Jerome Brown, 33, at her home last October.
   Brown did not tell her he had identified her as the victim of a
Dallas pedestrian accident in January 1988 and had her buried at
county expense, the Dallas Times Herald reported today.
   Brown also didn't tell her he had hired an attorney to pursue
the wrongful death lawsuit for ``negligent failure to provide a
street light'' on a freeway where she supposedly was killed while
trying to cross four lanes of traffic on Jan. 3, 1988.
   ``It's one of the strangest cases I've been involved in,'' said
homicide Detective James Gallagher.
   Brown apparently read newspaper accounts of an unidentified
traffic victim and decided to claim the body as that of his wife,
he said.
   ``This man presented himself, said he was the husband of
Jacquelyn Brown and said he thought she might have been killed in
an accident,'' said Bill Lene, chief field agent for the Dallas
County medical examiner's office. ``We showed a photograph of her
to him, and he identified the photo saying, `This is my wife.'''
   Authorities had no reason to question Brown's identification of
her, Lene said.
   Six weeks after Brown told officials he had no money to bury his
``wife,'' he hired an attorney who filed a claim with the city for
monetary damages, saying he and his two children had suffered pain
and suffering and the loss of companionship and earnings as a
result of his wife's death.
   Police say they don't know that the couple had any children.
   Brown was arrested in Malvern, Ark., last month on an auto theft
charge and also has been charged with capital murder in a 1986
robbery and slaying of a Little Rock prostitute.
   Gallagher said Brown's second wife _ Sonya Brown, 20 _ also has
been charged with murder as an accomplice in the Arkansas slaying.
   Gallagher said that under questioning, Sonya Brown revealed that
Brown told her he was somehow involved in Jacquelyn's death.
   When a detective went to review the death as a possible
homicide, he discovered that ``Jacquelyn Brown is not only alive
and well, but (Robert Brown) in October 1988 went to Arkansas to
visit her.''
   Gallagher said police now believe the dead woman may be a
22-year-old who was reported missing by her sister only last month.
The sister told police she had not seen the woman since December
1987.

<TEXT>
   Organizers of this weekend's march for
abortion rights said today they expect the demonstration to be
their largest ever and to help reshape the debate on abortion.
   Their numbers _ expected to be at least double the 90,000 who
marched here in 1986 _ will let the Bush administration and the
Supreme Court know ``women will not go back to the days of illegal
abortion,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization
for Women.
   ``We hope the march will be so big that the Supreme Court will
get the message,'' Yard said. If the Supreme Court reverses its
1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion, ``the law will
not be obeyed,'' she said.
   NOW and the Fund for the Feminist Majority also today released a
20-minute videotape intended to counter the right-to-life
movement's film, ``The Silent Scream,'' which depicts abortion as
murder.
   The pro-choice film, ``Abortion: For Survival,'' is intended to
show ``what abortion is, why it's needed and why the medical
establishment of our society and worldwide are for keeping it
legal,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist
Majority.
   The videotape will be distributed to members of Congress, state
legislators and to students on college campuses.
   As march organizers were releasing details of their
demonstration on Sunday, representatives from anti-abortion
organizations were holding their own press conference where they
called the pro-choice demonstration a ``death march'' and pledged
to continue working to end abortion on demand.
   Olivia Gans, director of American Victims of Abortion, said,
``Our organization is here to support equal rights for unborn women
_ specifically the right to life.''
   On Thursday, organizers of the pro-choice march said tens of
thousands of students from 500 college campuses are coming, mothers
are bringing their daughters and granddaughters, a delegation from
Capitol Hill will be there and dozens of celebrities are flying in
from Hollywood.
   ``We have been silent far too long,'' said Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   The goal is to make the weekend a turning point in the national
abortion debate. Organizers feel anti-abortion forces have focused
the question on when life begins. Pro-choice advocates say the
issue really is whether the government should intervene in what
they believe should be a private decision.
   ``Nobody likes abortion. It's a difficult choice and there are a
lot of issues that women have to weigh when faced with a crisis
pregnancy,'' Michelman said. ``Women don't have abortions they
want, they have abortions they need.''
   Organizers are reluctant to predict the size of the
demonstration, but they expect it will be far larger than a March
1986 pro-abortion rally of about 90,000 in Washington.
   At least one anti-abortion group plans to mount a
counterdemonstration of up to 300 people on the day of the march.
   This weekend's march is intended to send a strong message to the
Supreme Court justices considering a Missouri case that could
reverse or severely limit the high court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion. Oral arguments in the case are
scheduled for later this month.
   The Reagan administration pushed to overturn Roe vs. Wade and
failed, but President Bush is continuing the pressure. As one of
his first acts as president in January, Bush addressed by telephone
an anti-abortion rally of about 65,000 outside the White House.
   ``He has thrown down the gauntlet,'' Yard said.
   March organizers say women are responding with what they believe
will be a record outpouring of support. Since the 1986 march, the
number of organizations endorsing the march has doubled to more
than 400 and the number of college campuses participating also has
doubled.
   ``It's going to reshape the debate on abortion,'' said Eleanor
Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. ``Until
now, everybody said the other side (anti-abortion) is a minority
but is stronger and has more political clout. You can't say that
any more. We're going to show a tremendous outpouring of commitment
and feeling.''
   Anne Archer, national public advocacy chairman for Planned
Parenthood, said today on ``CBS This Morning'' that with regard to
the 1973 abortion ruling, ``I feel we have a danger of having it
reversed. And even if it's not, it will become so difficult to get
one (an abortion), it will be almost as if it's illegal.''
   ``People have forgotten what it was like prior to 1973, when
abortion was illegal _ the back-alley abortions, how women felt,
how desperate they could be, what they would do to get them and how
many women died,'' she said. ``The mortality rate dropped five-fold
when abortion was legalized.''

   A man confessed to a priest that he had
killed his 2{-year-old child and her mother and stuffed their
bodies in a refrigerator, said the priest, who persuaded the man to
surrender to authorities.
   Stephen A. Vrabel, 32, of Struthers, did not enter a plea when
charged with two counts of aggravated murder in Struthers Municipal
Court today. Judge Robert Kalafut set bond at $2 million and
appointed an attorney for the suspect, who said he didn't want a
lawyer.
   Vrabel turned himself in Thursday to authorities after spending
30 minutes in a confessional with the Rev. John Carlin, pastor of
St. Charles Roman Catholic Church in Parma, a Cleveland suburb.
   ``He told me that he has killed his wife and daughter,'' Carlin
said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   The confession in the confessional ``is a movie scenario,'' said
Carlin, 39, who has been a priest for 13 years. ``Yes, I was
scared.''
   The child, Lisa Clemente, was found bundled with two teddy
bears, blankets and a pillow and stuffed into the freezer
compartment of their apartment refrigerator, said Struthers
detective Dean Phillips.
   He said the body of the mother, Susan Clemente, 29, was in the
refrigerator compartment with blankets, sheets and a pillow tied
around her with rope. The refrigerator shelves had been removed.
   The woman and child each were shot in the head with a
small-caliber pistol, Phillips said. Authorities think they had
been dead for about a week when their bodies were found Wednesday
evening.
   ``Apparently, the reason he turned himself in is he heard the
news media reports'' Thursday about the bodies being found,
Phillips said at a news conference after the arraignment.
   Officials said that they were unsure whether Ms. Clemente and
Vrabel were married.
   Carlin said he would never have broken the secrecy demanded in
confession but twice was told by the man to help him explain to
police what had happened.
   When they talked with police, Carlin said, ``The guy was not
being real specific. He told me, `Well, you tell them what I said.'
''
   Vrabel repeated to Carlin in front of three police officers his
permission to have his confession of guilt disclosed, the priest
said.
   Carlin said he had never met Vrabel, who apparently was driving
through the neighborhood and spotted the church. Parma is about 60
miles northwest of Struthers, a Youngtown suburb.
   Vrabel approached the priest, who was hearing confessions. After
their talk they drove to police headquarters, where police found a
.22-caliber pistol in his car after obtaining a search warrant.
   During the arraignemnt this morning, Vrabel told the judge he
had last worked about six months ago and didn't have any income.
   Kalafut said investigators found beer cans throughout the
apartment and a type of gas mask that he said is often used in drug
use.
   ``Certainly this ranks as one of the most gruesome (slayings) in
the area in my 26 years as judge,'' Kalafut said. He said a
preliminary hearing would be held within 10 days.
   Vrabel, held at the Struthers jail, was to be transferred to the
Mahoning County jail to await trial, Phillips said.
   Ms. Clemente lived in a two-story apartment building in
Struthers, with her daughter and Vrabel, said Ms. Clemente's uncle,
Michael C. Clemente.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers loyal to Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril failed again today to put down a rebellion by troops
stationed near the Presidential Palace.
   The U.S. ambassador offered Washington's support for the
government which foiled a coup attempt Sunday but has been unable
to quell the mutiny.
   Rebel soldiers were 200 yards from the Presidential Palace,
which was guarded by loyal troops, anti-aircraft guns and cannons.
   Witnesses said loyalists killed four mutineers in a street of
the capital Thursday night, and a diplomat confirmed two of the
deaths. Four other rebel troops have been killed since Sunday.
   Streets of this normally bustling capital of 1 million people
were deserted this morning under a state of emergency. Stores,
schools and offices were closed. Airlines canceled flights into
Haiti's international airport.
   Haitians were cut off from developments because radio stations
either were not broadcasting news or were off the air, their cables
cut by government troops, apparently for violating military
censorship imposed by the state of emergency. Cables were cut at
Radios Antilles, Inter, Metropole and Liberte.
   A grenade thrown Thursday night by rebel troops knocked out the
transmitter tower at the state television station, said news
director Annaise Chavanet.
   The deep divisions in the military were seen as a sign that more
disorder may be imminent because Haitian soldiers rarely kill each
other.
   The rebels are demanding that Avril step down. They accuse the
government of favoritism toward the Presidential Guard in pay and
living conditions and of arbitrarily dismissing senior officers in
a crackdown on drugs and corruption.
   Members of the 400-man Leopards commando unit and troops from
the 700-man Dessalines barracks, the most repressive unit in
Haiti's 7,000-man army, were involved in the mutiny, but it was not
known how many.
   The Dessalines Barracks abuts the National Palace, protected by
members of Avril's 1000-man Presidential Guard.
   The nearby U.S. Consulate closed as a security precaution, an
official said. Its operations were moved to the U.S. Embassy, which
is several blocks away and remained open.
   A witness said an armored car carrying loyal soldiers of the
Presidential Guard on Thursday night chased a stolen army truck
carrying members of the Leopards unit that shot in the air as they
drove up and down on a road.
   The rebels fled into a house and the loyalist troops destroyed
it with high-caliber machine gunfire, killing the four and wounding
one, said the witness, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. Ambassador Brunson McKinley called on Avril at the palace
and expressed support for his government. ``The United States is
reassured by democratization under Avril,'' an embassy statement
said Thursday.
   Since coming to power six months ago in a coup, Avril has
restored some constitutional rights suspended in 1987 and approved
the establishment of an electoral council to prepare for elections.
   The embassy statement said it ``appears probable'' that Sunday's
coup attempt was organized by exiles linked to ousted dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled to France in 1986.
   Avril's government has imposed military censorship, and most
radio stations abbreviated or canceled newscasts Thursday.
   Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic station, reported one man
killed and three people wounded in shootings Wednesday and Thursday.
   The government has blamed Sunday's coup attempt on a ``vast
campaign against drug trafficking, contraband and corruption'' that
``collided with the interests'' of those who oppose democratic
change.
   The United States has made the crackdown a condition for the
resumption of $70 million in aid that it suspended after thugs
killed 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting Haiti's first free
elections in more than 30 years.
   The coup attempt Sunday was foiled when loyal soldiers rescued
Avril as he was being escorted in handcuffs to the airport to be
deported.
   Avril, 50, came to power in a coup led by non-commissioned
officers demanding democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored
violence. The coup ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, pledging U.S. help in seeking
a Mideast settlement, today described the situation in the troubled
region as marginally improved.
   Referring to a plan by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to
hold elections among Palestinian Arabs living under Israeli control
in the West Bank and Gaza, the president said:
   ``In the Middle East, a little step sometimes can be fruitful. I
think the climate is better than it has been.''
   Bush, meeting with reporters at the White House, said in
response to a question that it was too early for him to consider
traveling to the region to try to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``If I personally can be helpful, I am going to do it,'' Bush
said.
   But, he added, ``it is not a time when a lot of high-visibility
missions on the part of the president can be helpful in the
process.''
   As for the proposed elections, which Shamir suggested as a way
to select Arab delegates to meet with his goverment, Bush said:
   ``We haven't fully resolved exactly who's going to have a role;
that's a matter to be determined between the parties. ... The PLO
has people living on the West Bank. ...We want to see elections
that are free and fair.''
   Shamir's intent is to avoid PLO participation in selecting Arab
representatives by having Israeli authorities run the selection
process.
   Shamir presented his proposal to Bush on Thursday. At a news
conference, the prime minister ruled out having international
observers on hand for the voting. Still, Secrertary of State James
A. Baker III said he was encouraged about Mideast prospects.
   ``I think the important thing is that his proposal comes with
something that can be worked with,'' Baker said Thursday. ``It
offers us an opportunity to perhaps move the peace process forward.
And I think that's encouraging.''
   Shamir, who was meeting today with members of Congress, said
Israelis and Palestinians would oversee the balloting he intends to
hold on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   ``We do not think there is a need of international
supervision,'' he said. ``Israel has a long tradition of democracy
and decent and honest elections.''
   Shamir said he thinks that a majority of the 1.4 million
Palestinian Arabs living under Israeli control would participate in
the election. ``They are waiting for a peaceful solution,'' he said.
   The territories have been plagued with violence since
Palestinians began an uprising in December 1987. A total of 420
Palestinians and 18 Israelis have died in the unrest.
   Shamir, who blames the PLO for the violence, acknowledged the
PLO was likely to oppose the election. ``They want the immediate
establishment of an independent Palestinian state,'' Shamir said.
   His plan calls for the election of Palestinian leaders to
negotiate temporary self-rule. After a trial period, Shamir
proposes to have Israel, Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan work out a
permanent settlement.
   ``We do not want to run the lives of the inhabitants,'' Shamir
said in a speech Thursday. ``We want them to have self-rule.''
   But he again opposed establishment of a Palestinian state on the
West Bank and in Gaza, which Shamir said ``can only be a convenient
launching pad for terrorist attacks against the center of our
country.''
   Without the territories, Israel at its most densely populated
center is as wide as the distance between the White House and Chevy
Chase, a Washington suburb, Shamir said.
   While giving a qualified endorsement of the principle of holding
elections, Bush emphasized that Israel eventually must relinquish
the land the Arabs lost in the 1967 Six-Day war.
   Bush said he told Shamir ``we do not support an independent
Palestinian state, nor Israeli sovereignty over or permanent
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.''
   By mentioning Israeli ``sovereignty,'' Bush went a step beyond
his statement Monday that Israel must end the occupation of the
territory. And that, in itself, indicated a hardening U.S. stance.
   Shamir, in his speech, did not challenge Bush directly. But he
called the idea of Israel trading territory for peace, which other
presidents have endorsed, a hoax.
   ``The choice is not between Israel keeping the territories or
risking war,'' Shamir said. ``The opposite is true. If we leave,
there will almost certainly be war.''
   The election would determine the makeup of a Palestinian
delegation to negotiate with Israel for ``an interim period of
self-governing administration,'' Shamir said. That would be
followed by negotiations for ``a permanent agreement,'' he said.
   Baker, speaking later to reporters at the State Department, said
he was encouraged by the proposition.
   ``There is something new in this proposal,'' he said. ``It is
new _ the concept of elections before you go to transitional
arrangements. That is new.''
   Still, Baker said, ``There are a number of questions ... that
have to be fleshed out and answered. But it gives people who are
interested in trying to move the peace process forward something to
work with.''

<HEAD>Stabbing Victim Who Was Taken Off Life-Support System Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 26-year-old stabbing victim whose
life-support system was disconnected eight days ago over the
objections of his assailant died today, nearly four years after the
attack left him in a coma.
   Sylvia Lane said her son, Mark Weaver, died at about 2 a.m. ``He
died peacefully. He never had a moment's pain,'' she said.
   Noel Pagan, who served three years in prison for stabbing Weaver
during a street fight in 1985, fought unsuccessfully in court last
week to force Weaver's family to keep him alive on a feeding tube.
Prosecutors said Pagan, now on probation, could face a murder
charge once Weaver died, but they need a cause of death before they
can decide whether to seek charges.
   ``The medical examiner will conduct an autopsy and make a report
to us, and then we will make a decision,'' Attorney General James
E. Tierney said today.
   Tierney declined to say what sort of finding would be necessary
before a murder charge could be sought.
   ``I'm not going to answer any hypothetical questions about an
autopsy being conducted,'' Tierney said. He did not know how soon
to expect autopsy results.
   Pagan's lawyer, Robert Mullen, said last week he would try to
persuade prosecutors to file no additional charges in the case,
although he declined to appeal the ruling from Probate Judge Dana
Childs that allowed Weaver's family to remove the feeding tube just
after midnight on March 30. The judge said Pagan had no right to
intervene in Weaver's care.
   Mullen today declined to predict whether his client will face
charges, but he said if charges are lodged he will file motions to
get them thrown out.
   ``The first two that come to mind are double jeopardy and the
so-called year-and-a-day rule,'' Mullen said. Under that legal
provision, which was cited in at least two Maine cases, ``a person
must die a year and a day after an event to be charged with murder
or manslaughter,'' he said.
   The attorney for Weaver's family, Charles Kadish, did not answer
phone calls this morning.
   Funeral services were being arranged by the family.

   Q. Mr. President _
   A. Oh _ my protocol. Sorry about that.
   Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
   A. Sorry _
   Q. If I could try another subject. How do you reconcile your
efforts to arrange third-country military aid for the Contras with
the spirit of the ban by Congress on aid to the rebels?
   A. Look, I am not going to comment on any aspect of the North
trial while it's in progress.
   If I even commented on your question, it could prejudice the
trial that's going to be _ and that would be totally unfair.
   And I would note that of all the material that you seem to be
referring to and that has been introduced, all the material that
was introduced yesterday, material you're referring to, has been
available to the independent counsel, and the Iran-Contra
committee, and has been reviewed by them for any special
significance.
   So I believe the legal process ought to run unfettered, without
you or me endangering the trial process that's going on right now.
   And that's the last question I'll take on that subject.
   Yes, right here, and then to Frank.
   Q. Do you have any reply to Mr. Gorbachev's (inaudible) your
foreign policy review (inaudible)?
   A. This is an environmental briefing here and we're concerned
about the Alaska oil spill.
   But the answer is no.
   Let me simply say, we're the United States of America; we're
making a prudent review, and I will be ready to discuss that with
the Soviets when we are ready.
   And so _ and Mr. Gorbachev knows that there's no foot-dragging
going on, so I'm not concerned in the least.
   Now we go _ OK.
   Q. A number of local officials in Alaska, as well as Alaskan
residents, have been (inaudible) virtually since the spill took
place for a greater federal role. I guess my question would be, why
has it taken so long to reach this conclusion, and hasn't valuable
time been lost during your deliberations?
   A. Well, as you may recall, action started immediately.
   The big thing was to get the ship _ stop the hemorrhaging, and
get that ship moved.
   I immediately asked the head of the Coast Guard, and the head of
the Department of Transportation, and Bill Reilly to go up there.
   They came back and, upon sound advice, recommended that we not
federalize _ and let me be clear, we are not federalizing this
operation.
   There is no demand from reasonable people to federalize this
operation, and that is not going to be done.

   A Soviet-made Scud missile fired by
Afghanistan's besieged government forces blasted Pakistani
territory early today, authorities said. No casualties were
reported.
   Pakistan did not immediately respond. This country gives refuge
to more than 3 million Afghan war refugees and Moslem guerrillas
fighting to overthrow President Najib's communist government.
   The attack came after the guerrillas' government-in-exile
ordered more intense fighting in response to Najib's announcement
of a unilateral cease-fire to mark Islam's holiest month of
Ramadan, which began Thursday.
   Moscow added the missiles with their range of 100-175 miles to
the Afghan arsenal last November. They were paraded through Kabul
at the time, and Pakistan warned they were capable of hitting
hitting Pakistani territory.
   Government troops have been firing Scud missiles at Jalalabad,
where their fellow soldiers are engaged in an intense battle for
the city with Moslem guerrillas. Kabul is 120 miles west of the
Pakistan border.
   In the Afghan capital Thursday, state radio said nine civilians
and one soldier have been killed during the past 24 hours in a
barrage of rebel rocket fire on Jalalabad, 45 miles west of the
Pakistan border.
   The rebels' Afghan News Agency said in a statement that 80
Afghan soldiers were killed in fighting around Jalalbad in the past
three days.
   Kabul Radio also blamed rebels for the deaths of three people
whom it said were killed when rockets hit the eastern garrison town
of Khost, several miles from the Pakistan border. The radio report
said government troops killed 148 guerrillas in retaliatory
fighting.
   It is impossible to verify either sides' claims.
   Rebel sources in Pakistan have rejected as a propaganda ploy the
government's latest cease-fire offer, proposed Wednesday.

   A former diplomat and a prominent businessman
were among three Panamanians who have been charged with conspiring
to smuggle $300 million in cocaine into the United States,
authorities said.
   The three were arrested Thursday after undercover agents lured
them to Georgia with promises of a major drug deal, said Ronald
Caffrey, special agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Agency office in Atlanta.
   ``It's the biggest case I've ever been associated with of this
type and, as far as I know, the biggest of this type in this
area,'' said Bibb County Sheriff Ray Wilkes.
   The three were identified as Manuel Jose Castillo-Bourcy, 52;
Juan Karamanides, 35; and Carlos Eleta-Lopez, 70. All are from
Panama City, Panama.
   A hearing was scheduled Monday before a U.S. Magistrate in
Macon. Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Fowler said the government
will ask that bond be denied for all three suspects.
   Caffrey said Castillo-Bourcy was Panama's former ambassador to
Belize. Karamanides was described as a businessman, while Caffrey
said Eleta-Lopez is president of General Mills in Panama and owns a
television station and racetrack there.
   Eleta-Lopez also founded Panama's Partido Laborista (PALA), a
right-wing political faction, in 1982.
   ``We're dealing with people who are very well-known
professionals and business people,'' Wilkes said.
   They are each charged in a federal criminal complaint with
conspiring to bring into the United States 1,320 pounds of cocaine.
Wilkes said no cocaine was seized in the arrests.
   ``It's not in this country. The conspiracy's enough for the
arrests,'' he said.
   Wilkes said the men were arrested after flying from Panama to
Atlanta and then traveling to Macon by limousine. The arrests
followed an undercover investigation involving the Bibb County
narcotics squad as well as the DEA, the U.S. Secret Service, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Marshals
Service.

   Peter Raisch of the Baden-Wuerttemberg state police in Stuttgart

   Raisch would identify the electronic equipment only as
``technical equipment that can be used for armaments.''

<HEAD>Five Charged with Conspiracy in Gandhi Assassination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government Friday charged five Sikhs
with conspiracy in the assassination of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi in 1984, which it said was part of a plot to establish a
separate Sikh nation.
   One defendant, Rattan Singh, was killed by rival Sikh militants
in 1985, the government said. The others are Simranjeet Singh Mann,
a former senior police officer; Attinder Pal Singh, a well-known
militant; and college lecturers Dalip Singh and Jagmohan Singh Tony.
   Officers of the Special Investigating Team examining the case
filed the charges with S.L. Khanna, chief magistrate of New Delhi.
   All five are accused of waging war aginst the state, sedition,
criminal conspiracy, murder and attempted murder. The charges carry
the death penalty.
   Beant Singh and and Satwant Singh, Sikh members of Mrs. Gandhi's
personal guard, shot her down Oct. 31, 1984, in her New Delhi
residence. Beant Singh was killed by other bodyguards and Satwant
Singh was hanged Jan. 6.
   Also hanged was Kehar Singh, an uncle of Beant Singh, who was
convicted of conspiracy.
   None of the other Singhs are related. All male Sikhs take the
name Singh, which means lion in Punjabi, as a doctrine of their
faith.
   The government said the five began plotting after the army raid
Mrs. Gandhi ordered in June 1984 on Sikhism's holiest shrine, the
Golden Temple in Amritsar.
   Its list of charges gave this account of the defendants'
activities:
   They conspired to commit ``sensational acts in order to create
chaos, confusion and anarchy by hijacking planes, breaching canals,
poisoning drinking water supply and destroying Parliament House.''
   Those acts included organizing the hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane to Dubai on Aug. 24, 1984. They planned to kill Mrs.
Gandhi and her son, Rajiv, who succeeded her as prime minister, in
September in Nagpur, central India, but ``the assassination ...
could not be executed for want of weapons.''
   Mann and Attinder Pal Singh decided to attempt the murder
through someone associated with Mrs. Gandhi's security, and
Attinder Pal Singh ``located Sub-Inspector Beant Singh as the most
suitable person,'' the government said.
   Attinder Pal Singh fled to Pakistan a week before the
assassination, ``where he was given a free hand'' to enlist support
for a separate Sikh nation in Punjab, the only Indian state where
Sikhs are the majority.
   He also was allowed to ``provide arms for training Sikh youth
and contact foreign-based activists for financial help,'' according
to the government.
   It did not elaborate on the militants' alleged links to
Pakistan, but India often accuses the Pakistanis of supporting Sikh
secessionists. No proof has been offered, and Pakistan, which
borders Punjab, denies it.
   Mann was arrested in December 1984 while trying to flee to Nepal
and Attinder Pal Singh was apprehended in October 1988.
   While in custody, Mann was named president of the Unified Akali
Dal, a militant Sikh political party in Punjab, a northern state
that is India's richest agricultural region.
   He resigned as a senior superintendent of police to protest the
raid on the Golden Temple, whose purpose was to dislodge militants
who had turned the shrine into a fortress. At least 1,200 people
were killed in the assault.
   Only 2 percent of India's 880 million people are Sikhs. They
accuse Hindus, who make up 90 percent, of discrimination.
   Sikh militants began fighting for a separate nation in 1982. At
least 2,400 people were killed in 1988 and more than 500 people
have been slain so far this year.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Announces Halt In Production of Weapons-Grade Uranium</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Thatcher saying Soviet halt in uranium
production would have little effect. TRIMS to tighten. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mikhail Gorbachev today announced the Soviet Union
is halting production of weapons-grade uranium and will shut down
two more nuclear reactors that produce plutonium for nuclear
weapons by the end of next year.
   In a half-hour speech in London's Guildhall, the Soviet
president called his unilateral action ``another major step toward
the complete cessation of production of fissionable materials for
use in weapons.''
   Arms experts said today that while uranium and plutonium are
both used in Soviet nuclear weapons, plutonium is used more often
and that Moscow has enough on hand to produce more weapons.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told reporters the Soviet move
``will have no effect in practice'' because ``they probably have
quite a sufficient stockpile of uranium.''
   In Washington, President Bush declined to comment on Gorbachev's
announcement, saying he had not had time to review it.
   A Pentagon official said the steps outlined by Gorbachev would
not have a major impact on the Soviet capability to wage war.
   Gorbachev reiterated promises he made at the United Nations in
December that the Soviet Union would soon begin paring 500,000 men
from its standing army and withdrawing troops and tanks from Europe
and the Chinese frontier.
   Gorbachev made a strong appeal for world disarmament, but he
warned the process could falter if the West did not reciprocate.
   After the address, broadcast live throughout Britain and the
United States, Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, called on Queen
Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, then left for Moscow at the end of
a six-day trip to Ireland, Cuba and Britain.
   Gorbachev invited the queen to visit the Soviet Union. She said
she would like to accept but that her foreign travel is always
fixed years in advance.
   Queen Elizabeth II would be the first monarch to go to Russia
since her grandfather's cousin, Czar Nicholas II, and his family
were killed after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.
   Speaking at Guildhall, the city's seat of government for 1,000
years, Gorbachev said the world has reached a crossroad in which it
has to choose between peaceful interdependency and ``a policy of
force rooted in the past.
   ``If NATO goes ahead with its program of modernizing tactical
nuclear weapons,'' he said, ``this is bound also to devalue much of
what has been achieved under the INF treaty'' on medium-range
nuclear weapons that he signed with President Ronald Reagan in 1987.
   Gorbachev said, ``In addition to the industrial reactor for the
production of weapons-grade plutonium shut down in 1987, we plan to
shut down two other such reactors this year and next year without
commissioning new units to replace them.''
   ``We have completed the construction of a facility for the
destruction of chemical weapons and indeed to invite soon your
representatives to visit it,'' Gorbachev said.
   British experts on nuclear arsenals said it was difficult to
assess the impact of the Soviet cutbacks in production of
fissionable materials because the number of such production
facilities is secret.
   A nuclear physicist in England, who also requested anonymity,
said that uranium and plutonium are both still used in nuclear
weapons production but that plutonium is in wider use in the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   Francois Heisbourg, director of the London-based Institute of
Strategic Studies, said Gorbachev's announcement that the Soviets
would close two plutonium-producing reactors was new.
   But he said it was ``not as significant as it may sound because
there is already plenty of plutonium around which the Soviets can
use to make bombs.''
   The Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Soviets ``have stockpiles of weapons-grade materials'' and
could restart production in several years when supplies run low.
   Reiterating earlier promises, Gorbachev also said armed manpower
would be cut by 12 percent, the military budget by 14 percent and
weapons production by nearly 20 percent. Military factories are
being switched to production of consumer goods, and military
transport planes would be redeployed to carry civilian cargoes, he
said.
   He said the new Supreme Soviet, a legislative body to be
selected by the recently elected parliament, will publish the
nation's defense budget, most of which is now concealed.
   The speech got a standing ovation from the civic and political
leaders at Guildhall and a ringing endorsement by Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``We want you to succeed in your task,'' she said after the
speech. ``We're ready to help in practical ways.''

   So what have we done?
   The flow was stopped.
   And let me be very clear: I give great credit, certainly _ and
some of those that are working out there, volunteers, private side,
local citizens, company and everything else _ for stopping (the
flow).
   But I also give great credit to the Coast Guard and to military
assets that have already been used in moving equipment thousands of
miles to get this _ get this _ stop the flow.
   And I'll tell you, a lot has been done.
   I've had a talk here with Bill Reilly about protecting the
hatcheries.
   And I don't want to make premature judgments on this, but it
looks like the five hatcheries may have been saved.
   And now there's _ is that an overstatement? (Inaudible.)
   And now the cleanup phase comes and it's the time when we can
step up some activity.
   So, something has gone on.
   I'm not about to defend the status quo, but there is no desire
on our part to federalize.
   We're not going to do it.
   And I think it's fair to point this out: I think their
priorities were right.
   There was four times as much oil in that ship as spilled out of
that ship, and it was important to stop, to guarantee, even in
rough elements up there, that no more escaped.
   And so, some things have happened.
   It was prudent to contain that spill.
   And so the process is going forward.
   Q. Mr. President?
   A. Yes, Brit?
   Q. Do you have a sense yet of how much this federal effort is
going to cost? And will you try to recover from Exxon that amount?
   A. As I said, Exxon is liable, and they will continue to be
liable, and we don't at this point have a full assessment.
   Lesley?
   Q. Will you take them to court on that, sir? To follow up, will
you take them to court?
   A. I think Exxon has assumed liability, and I'm not going to
stand here and suggest otherwise.
   Q. Mr. President, Mr. Gorbachev today made another arms control
gesture, saying that he'll stop production of weapons-grade uranium
and shut down two plutonium plants. What's your response, or
reaction?
   A. I've given you my response.
   We'll be ready to react when we feel like reacting, and when we
have prudently made our _ our reviews upon which to act.
   Q. I meant, what do you think of his proposal or his offer? Is
this a big step forward?
   A. I haven't _ I haven't seen it analyzed, Lesley, so I honestly
can't tell you that I know the full significance.
   John?
   Q. I know you don't want to talk about it, but Senator Muskie,
former Senator Muskie, who was a member of the Tower Commission,
says he was not aware of this effort to involve the Hondurans, or
of your role. You have said this was available to the Tower
Commission. Do you want to reply to that, without prejudicing
Oliver North?

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat today
criticized a U.S.-backed Israeli proposal for elections in
Israeli-occupied territories.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization leader, making the
comments on the second day of a two-day trip to Congo, also said
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip will continue
a nearly 16-month-old uprising against Israeli rule ``until the
ultimate victory.''
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak ``Shamir's statement in
Washington is inappropriate, as usual. ... All oppressors in the
world have used the same language,'' Arafat said.
   Shamir proposed that Palestinians in the occupied lands elect
representatives to talk to Israel about establishing limited
self-rule. Under the plan, talks on the ultimate disposition of the
occupied territories would be left until later.
   President Bush, who has been meeting with Shamir in Washington,
gave qualified support to Shamir's proposal Thursday.
   Palestinians opposing the proposal have insisted elections be
part of a larger plan to end the occupation.
   Arafat reiterated his demand for an international peace
conference on the Middle East, with the participation of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and all concerned
parties, including the PLO. Israel refuses to negotiate with the
PLO, which it considers a terrorist organization.
   ``Until the ultimate victory, the uprising of the populations of
the Gaza and West Bank will continue,'' Arafat said.
   Israeli officials have said that Shamir's plan made no specific
demand for the end of the uprising as a condition for elections.
   Israel seized the West Bank, home to 1.7 million Arabs, from
Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.

   Influential Palestinians reacted coolly today
to a U.S.-backed Israeli call for elections in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, insisting any balloting be part of a package that
promises an end to occupation.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat, visiting Congo, criticized the proposal
as inappropriate and said the nearly 16-month-old Palestinian
uprising would continue ``until the ultimate victory.''
   Several thousand Palestinians rioted today, shouting nationalist
slogans and burning an Israeli flag outside Jerusalem's Al Aqsa
mosque.
   Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to quell the violence,
a day after President Bush gave Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
qualified support of his proposal for elections in the occupied
lands to choose Palestinian leaders who would negotiate self-rule.
The two leaders are meeting in Washington.
   Talks on the ultimate disposition of the occupied territories
would be left until later.
   ``I think the intefadeh (uprising) will continue until Shamir
comes up with a better proposal,'' said Hanna Siniora, editor of
the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr newspaper.
   Siniora and most other Palestinians interviewed today said
Israel would have to accept giving up land it seized in the 1967
Middle East war and end the military occupation over the 1.7
million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Israeli newspaper editorials said the right-wing premier had won
only a brief respite from the diplomatic pressure on Israel to make
concessions to match Arafat's steps in recognizing Israel and
forswearing terror.
   The Palestinian Liberation Organization leader, on a visit to
Congo, said ``Shamir's statement in Washington is inappropriate, as
usual. ... All oppressors in the world have used the same
language.''
   Leaders of the left-leaning Labor Party headed by Finance
Minister Shimon Peres were initially silent on the Washington
talks. But Shulamit Aloni, leader of the liberal Citizens Rights
Movement, accused Shamir of procrastinating.
   Palestinian leftists and pro-Syrian supporters rule out
elections. Other opinion leaders expressed skepticism about
Shamir's motivation but appeared to leave the door open to further
discussions.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, businessman Said Kenaan said
Shamir's real objective was to avoid talking to the PLO and
sidetrack negotiations to a temporary solution that ignored
Palestinian demands for statehood.
   Nabil Jabari, the board chairman of Hebron University who spent
65 days in administrative detention without trial for alleged
contacts with PLO leaders, said the PLO would have to approve any
election plan.
   ``I would not agree to any election if it is only limited to
voting and is not part of an overall package to solve the
Palestinian problem,'' he said.
   Some Palestinians said elections would have to be preceded by
tension-relieving steps such as the release of the 1,187
Palestinians detained without trial, allowing deported activists to
return to stand as candidates and lifting military orders
restricting freedom of speech and assembly.
   Jonathan Kuttab, a West Bank lawyer and human rights activist,
said in an interview: ``Palestinians are not opposed to elections
themselves but are opposed to the idea if the real objective is to
avoid dealing with the Palestinian people's representatives, the
PLO.''
   Kuttab said laws banning contact with the PLO would have to be
lifted so any Palestinians elected could serve as a bridge to the
PLO, the only body that could speak for the world's 5 million
Palestinians.
   Al Quds, the leading pro-PLO daily in Arab east Jerusalem, noted
with satisfaction the U.S. opposition to continued Israeli
occupation and its stand against Israeli annexation of the land.
But it cautiously avoided comment on the elections proposal that
Bush endorsed.
   In Washington, Bush told the visiting Israeli prime minister the
United States does not suport ``an independent Palesntinian state,
nor Israeli sovereignty over or permanent occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza.''

   A. No.
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. Because I don't want to prejudice the trial, John.
   It would be imprudent for us to do that, and we're not going to
do it.
   And I stand by my statement about the Iran-Contra committee.
   Q. Will you speak after the trial?
   A. That's it.
   Q. Mr. President, the conventional wisdom is that an American
president never has much to gain by getting personally involved in
the Middle East. But I was thinking that maybe you were an
exception, given your initial round this week. Can you tell us
what's in your mind about the Middle East, if you see yourself
getting very personally involved over the course of your presidency
in trying to solve this?
   A. Look, if I help _ if I felt that being immersed in it would
help solve the problem of peace in the Middle East, I would do that.
   And I think you're right, there have been times when it appears
that the president shouldn't be fully involved.
   But we've had two visits here now this week _ President Mubarak,
Prime Minister Shamir.
   We'll have a visit, a forthcoming visit from King Hussein.
   And I'm going to give the same assurances to him I've given to
Mubarak and Shamir, and that is that if I personally can be
helpful, I want to do it.
   And in the meantime, why, I will say that _ I can't say I'm
elated _ but in the Middle East, a little step sometimes can be _
prove to be fruitful.
   And I hope that _ I think the climate is better than it's been
in a while.
   But I would simply say it is not a time where a lot of
high-visibility missions on the part of the president can
accommodate _ can be helpful in the process.
   But I want to leave you with the view that it is of deep concern
to us, particularly the violence in the West Bank.
   And so _ and I think both leaders that I've talked to so far
know my personal feelings on this.
   And we're not despairing.
   In fact, I hope the two visits have moved things forward a
little bit.
   Saul?
   Q. Do your statements today mean that you won't discuss this
Contra affair?
   A. Yes!
   It means I've said all I want to say about it!
   Look, we're having a briefing on Alaska and with all respect _
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. Did I cut you off?
   Come on _ oh!
   Q. Does it mean you won't discuss it until the end of the Ollie
North trial?
   A. It means I've said all I want to say about it because I
really believe, on the advice of lawyers, that that's the last
thing we ought to do _ is even be kicking it around to this end.
   So please accept it when I said I don't want to talk about it
any more and I'm not going to.
   So _ nice try!
   Q. (Inaudible) until after the trial _
   A. Now, I just said _ just let it stand.
   Go back and interpret what I said _ yes.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Unveil New Peace Proposal, But Cristiani Rejects It</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-US-Salvador</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with Cristiani rejecting rebel plan. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels unveiled a new
proposal for ending El Salvador's nine-year civil war, but it was
rejected today by President-elect Alfredo Cristiani.
   The proposal released Thursday termed ``illegitimate'' the
landslide victory of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance,
or Arena, in the March 19 presidential election. It called on Arena
to declare itself a transitional government and for general
elections before year's end.
   The rebels said the new government, which is scheduled to take
power June 1 from outgoing President Jose Napoleon Duarte, must
choose between escalated civil war and negotiated peace.
   Cristiani, who is in Washington to meet with President Bush,
said at a news conference today: ``I would definitely not consider
our government a transitional government unless you put it in a
five-year term.'' However, he said, his government will be willing
to talk with the rebels to ``try to seek a way by which they can
incorporate themselves into the process.''
   Cristiani has said many times that the insurgents must lay down
their arms and incorporate themselves into the democratic process.
The guerrillas say that is tantamount to a call for surrender and
reject it.
   The guerrillas have vowed to step up attacks in the coming weeks
to demonstrate to Arena the country is ``ungovernable'' without
their consent.
   Thursday's guerrilla proposal was similar to one announced Jan.
23. The new plan added elements resulting from subsequent talks in
Mexico between the rebels and Salvadoran political party
representatives.
   The Salvadoran government rejected the January proposal.
   ``We do not believe the image campaign through which Arena is
trying to present itself as a moderate force,'' said the guerrilla
document, signed by the five members of the insurgent high command.
   After its 1981 founding, Arena was associated with right-wing
death squads accused of slaying tens of thousands of suspected
leftists.
   Cashiered army Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, the alleged godfather
of the death squads, is an Arena legislator and leader of the
congress' majority block.
   Cristiani maintains the party has matured into a modern
conservative organization with an ideology similar to that of U.S.
Republicans. Arena opponents say Cristiani is little more than a
pseudo-democratic veneer for a neo-fascist party.
   ``Arena has made it clear it will pursue a policy of slaughter
and total war,'' said the rebel proposal.
   It alleged that Arena is now virtually running the government
despite the still-incumbent Christian Democratic administration. It
claimed human rights abuses have surged since the Arena victory.
   Independent human rights monitors have said they lack enough
data to back up that contention.
   The guerrillas reiterated earlier demands that implicated army
officers be tried and punished for rights abuses and that the army
be reduced from its current strength of 56,000 to its 1978 level of
12,000.
   They also called for elimination of the three police forces and
formation of a single police force under civilian administration.
The internal security forces currently depend on the Defense
Ministry, which is headed by an army general.
   They said additionally that the judicial system, which they
characterized as corrupt and inefficient, must be purged and
reformed.
   The rebels said that if their conditions were met, the FMLN
would cease the armed struggle and incorporate itself into the
country's political process.

   Art enthusiasts paid record prices for 20th
century Russian works this week, as Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev visited Britain.
   Sotheby's said its sale of 187 paintings, film posters,
porcelain, ballet and theater designs and illustrated books, drew
nearly $6 million, a record for a Russain avant-garde art sale.
   ``The timing was a coincidence. We wanted to attract new buyers
who were in London for the big sales of impressionist art earlier
this week,'' said Sotheby's expert, Asya Chorley.
   An unidentified buyer paid nearly $1.3 million for Alexandra
Exter's 1912 ``Composition (Genoa),'' a visionary view of a city.
The price was the highest ever paid for a 20th century Russian
painting.
   An anonymous telephone bidder paid $804,000 for Liubov Popova's
1918 abstract ``Painterly Architectonic.''
   Two other Popova abstracts were bought for a total of $1.4
million by Waddington Galleries, London dealers.

   Q. Do you believe the PLO should have a role in independent
elections in Israel _ West Bank?
   A. I think that the answer is to get on with the elections and
I've _ I'd like to _ we haven't fully resolved exactly who's going
to have a role but I think that's a matter to be determined by _
between the parties _ but I'd leave it right there.
   I'd leave it right there.
   The PLO has people living on the West Bank, as you know, and we
want to see elections that are free and fair there.
   Yeah, Dave?
   Q. Mr. President, is your statement this week about Israel
ending the occupation intended as sort of a diplomatic nudge to
Prime Minster Shamir? Should we read something into that?
   A. I wouldn't read anything into it.
   I do not feel that the provisions of Security Council Resolution
242 and 338 have been fulfilled.
   And I wanted to be clear to all the parties in the Middle East
that that is my view.
   And I've _ will hold the _ as best the U.S. can, hold the
parties to a full implementation of those resolutions.
   And so, what I was signalling is _ is that the territory that
has been ceded for peace is not the end.
   It simply isn't.
   Yeah, Ellen?
   Q. Mr. President, you've used words like ``deadly'' and
``tragic'' and ``disastrous'' to describe this oil spill. During
the campaign, you said you were an environmentalist. Have you had
any opportunity to rescind your commitment to drilling in the
Arctic Wildlife Refuge as a result of this disaster?
   A. Yeah, I had the opportunity.
   Q. And what have you decided?
   A. No, I don't think that _ I don't think that you _ that you
compromise the genuine national security interests of this country.
   And I don't think that you can predicate a sound national energy
policy on an aberration that seemed to have taken place in Prince
William Sound.
   And my _ if _ for those that do, I say, please, let me follow
logically.
   Are you suggesting because of the alleged human error of a pilot
of a ship in Prince William Sound that we shut down all the
offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico?
   Is that the suggestion?
   If so, I oppose it.
   And I think we've got to do what I said in this statement, do
everything humanly possible here and elsewhere, on land and on sea,
to see that we have the soundest environmental practice and reserve
in terms of putting out fires or stemming the flow of oil that
leaks out, gets away.
   But I am not going to suggest that, because of this, we should
rethink a policy of trying to get this country less dependent on
foreign oil.
   Yes?

   Police said they found a 12th century
wooden statue and 270 artifacts stolen from a church last year in a
garage on the outskirts of Perugia.
   Three people were brought in for questioning about the theft of
the 49-inch high ``Madonna with Child'' and other artifacts, news
agencies said.
   The statue, carved by an unknown artist in the 12th century, was
among the itmes stolen from the church of Santa Maria in Camuccia
in the hillside town of Todi, 60 miles northeast of Rome, in 1988.
   Thieves entered the church through the basement during an
archaeological excavation and dismantled an alarm system in the
chapel where the statue was displayed, news reports said.

   Lev Kopelev, the Soviet writer and
human rights activist expelled from his homeland eight years ago,
has been given permission to visit Moscow, his wife said Friday.
   Raisa Orlova Kopelev confirmed the report in the Essen-based
Neue Ruhr-Neue Rhine newspaper that Kopelev had been granted a visa
and said her husband would likely travel to the Soviet Union on
Sunday to celebrate his 77th birthday.
   She did not say how long the visit might last.
   The Soviets' decision to approve a visa for Kopelev ``came as a
total surprise,'' Mrs. Kopelev said by telephone from their home in
Cologne.
   Kopelev, now a West German citizen, was expelled from the Soviet
Union in 1981. In the 1960s and 1970s Kopelev spoke out in support
of writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn, physicist Andrei Sakharov who won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, and other critics of the Kremlin.

   Q. Mr. President, you said earlier that you don't want to defend
the status quo in Alaska. You sounded sometimes like you're
defending Exxon. Are you satisified with their performance since
the spill? What have they done wrong and what could they have done
better?
   A. Let these experts tell you.
   Q. Mr. President, you have said a couple of times _
   A. I'm not satisifed with anything about it, when we have a risk
to the environment like this.
   Because Ellen was telling you correctly, I feel very, very
strongly about the damage to our environment there, to the
fisheries, to the lives of people involved there and to all of that.
   So I am not totally satisified.
   Yeah? I'm going to take two more.
   We're taking too much time away from the people that are really
most thoroughly involved at this.
   Besides, we're getting off Marlin's schedule.
   The press: Aaaaawww!
   Bush: Thank you for your understanding. (Laughter.)
   Q. Let me make one more subject change, if I may, sir. You've
said a couple of times your minimum wage offer is your last and
best. Does that mean you feel that the package being debated on the
hill now, the Democrats' package, is worse than no bill at all, sir?
   A. Well, there's several packages being debated, but I've told
you _ you know, in terms of the increase and the length of time for
the training wage, we did something unusual.
   We fired our best shot and last shot and only shot first.
   And I'd like to take this opportunity to say what I heard
several of our leaders saying yesterday after the meeting, I have
no intention of budging one inch on this.
   And I've got too much at stake to change right now, and I'm not
going to.
   And so, that's what we've done and I know it's an unusual
procedure.
   The secretary of labor made her position very, very clear in
this.
   And there we are.
   Yes?
   Q. I just want to ask one last question on the spill. You said
that the cleanup would be protracted. How long do you think it's
going to take, the number of years, and is there any real expection
this will ever be cleaned up?

<HEAD>Executive Says No One Indicated Consultant Was Paying Bribes</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Subs 4th graf pvs with 2 grafs on jury going home until Monday.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A business executive charged in the
Pentagon fraud case testified today that no one at his company ever
indicated that one of the firm's consultants was paying illegal
bribes to a Navy official.
   Dale Schnittjer, a former vice president at Teledyne Electronics
in Newbury Park, Calif., was the third of three defendants to take
the stand in his defense in the trial in U.S. District Court.
   On Thursday, Schnittjer's associates at Teledyne, George Kaub
and Eugene Sullivan, also denied they knew about illegal activities
carried out by William Parkin, a private consultant Teledyne had
hired in 1985. The three defendants are charged with bribery,
conspiracy, wire fraud and making false statements.
   Schnittjer's testimony came at the tail end of the defense's
case. Before U.S. District Judge Richard Williams sent the jury
home for the weekend, Thomas Keenan, Schnittjer's former boss at
Teledyne Continental Motors in Muskegon, Mich., testified the
defendant is a man whose ``honesty and integrity were impeccable.''
   Williams said he would ask attorneys to make their closing
arguments on Monday before letting the jury deliberate.
   Schnittjer, Sullivan's successor, said he arrived at Teledyne
Electronics in the summer of 1987 nearly two years after Parkin was
hired for $10,000. Parkin's 1985 contract called for him to receive
$150,000 for future work should Teledyne be awarded a $24 million
contact to build hand-held radar equipment. The Pentagon selected
Teledyne for that job in July, 1987.
   At a meeting of Teledyne executives after the awarding of the
contract, Schnittjer said ``there was a general feeling that
Teledyne Electronics had an obligation'' to honor the deal with
Parkin ``because the (radar) contract had been awarded,''
Schnittjer said.
   At the meeting, Schnittjer said no one indicated Parkin had done
anything illegal to help secure the contract. Parkin, who has
pleaded guilty in the case and is cooperating with the government,
testified he bribed a Navy official for inside information about
the radar contract.
   In a related matter, Joseph E. Hill, 76, of Mineola, N.Y., was
sentenced to one year unsupervised probation and fined $20,000 for
making illegal campaign contributions to congressional campaigns.
Hill, a private consultant, pleaded guilty to the four misdemeanor
counts earlier this year.
   He acknowledged that he channeled corporate contributions to the
campaigns of unwitting congressional candidates as part of a scheme
organized by several former executives of Unisys Corp. Hill is one
of about a dozen people who have pleaded guilty in the wide-ranging
government investigation of Pentagon procurement known as
``Operation Ill Wind.''
   The only people to be tried in the case so far are Schnittjer,
Sullivan and Kaub.
   In testimony Thursday, Sullivan and Kaub said they never looked
into what type of business Parkin operated because the man had a
stellar reputation in defense circles.
   On the witness stand, Sullivan and Kaub vehemently denied they
knew anything about Parkin's illegal activities.
   They said he was hired for $10,000 in November 1985 to help the
firm reverse a decision to give the contract to a minority business
firm.
   After Teledyne was awarded the job, Parkin repeatedly called the
Teledyne executives seeking the $150,000 he said was due from the
firm because he helped the defense contractor win the bid.
   During the trial, the government played tape-recorded
conservations of wiretaps they had placed on the telephones of the
defendants and Parkin. Kaub said most of the conversations he had
were Parkin ``ranting and raving and I didn't pay any attention to
it.''
   Sullivan, who occasionally used salty language, was asked his
reaction to hearing the tapes. ``I may change my ways,'' he said.
   But both men said they had full confidence in Parkin's
capabilities because he had been a respected official with the
Navy, ending his government career in 1983 as the director of
acquistions for the Joint Cruise Missile Project.
   Noting that Parkin worked as a private consultant for a number
of big companies such at Boeing, Kaub said, ``you have to make an
assumption that he is in fact doing legitimate work.''
   Sullivan said he knew that Parkin employed associates in his
business, but he never inquired about their identities.
   Parkin said he had partners who were working in private
industry.``They didn't want their names revealed,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pastor Says King's Old Church Losing Spirit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pastor of the church where Martin
Luther King Jr. rose to national prominence has decided to retire,
complaining the congregation is losing the spirit that helped bring
about social change.
   The Rev. G. Murray Branch, 74, said he will step down as pastor
of Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church on June 30 and return
to Atlanta, where he taught for many years at a seminary.
   ``I'm a little weary,'' he said. ``But the main reason I'm
leaving is there has been a demand on the church _ an increase in
service _ but participation has declined.''
   The church in downtown Montgomery has become a tourist
attraction because King was its pastor when he rose to national
prominence as leader of the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955-56. The
church since has been the rallying point for many civil rights
demonstrations.
   But Branch said the congregation has declined to about 250
active members and there has been a drop in community and church
activities by the remaining members.
   ``That's another reason I'm unhappy with this congregation,'' he
said. ``Given the laity of this congregation and the status of the
majority of the members _ socially and economically _ they ought to
be involved in more meaningful community service.''
   Addre Bryant, chairman of the board of deacons, agreed with
Branch that not everyone was participating fully. ``It takes
different things to motivate folks to do things. Some things may
depend on the organization of the church,'' he said. ``There really
has been no organization.''

<TEXT>
   A sweltering weekend lay ahead for southern
Californians sweating out a springtime heat wave that has packed
beaches and prompted special patient care in a hospital left
without air conditioning after a fire.
   Residents braced today for a sizzling repeat of Thursday's
weather, which sent the temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center
soaring to 106 degrees _ the hottest day of the year and the
hottest April day on record.
   El Toro in Orange County was the hottest spot in the nation
Thursday, frying at 112 degrees.
   The National Weather Service forecast temperatures to top 100
degrees in most of the region for a fourth straight day and issued
a heat warning for residents, urging them to sit still and drink
plenty of water.
   The record April 7 high at the civic center was 88, set in 1904,
and was certain to fall. By 9 a.m., downtown was already 82 degrees.
   The forecast concerned nurses at UCLA Medical Center, who were
giving patients tepid baths and covering them in moist towels after
a fire Thursday night knocked out air conditioning in the
400-patient hospital.
   Adminstrators closed the emergency room and surgeons canceled
all elective surgery while workers scrambled through the night to
repair the giant air conditioning units, said spokesman John Lewis.
   ``The best we can hope for is to have half the air conditioning
going by mid-afternoon today,'' he said. ``But it's still dark, and
I'm already beginning to feel the heat coming on.''
   Firefighters were investigating the cause of the blaze that
struck the cooling towers on the roof of the hospital. No patients
had to be transferred as of early today.
   The hot, dry Santa Ana winds from the desert bathed the Los
Angeles basin in heat from the mountains to the beaches, where air
temperatures in the 80s and 90s clashed with more seasonal water
temperatures in the 60s.
   ``People going to the beach and not going into the water are
just exposing themselves to the sun,'' said Dr. George Gellert, a
Los Angeles County health official. ``They may be better off
remaining in the shade.''
   Northern California had its own heat wave.
   Even normally mild San Francisco hit a record 91 degrees on
Thursday, five degrees above the previous high for that date set in
1924.

<HEAD>WASHN: cleaned up?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. Well, I think there's _ I think we've got to hope that it is.
   I think Santa Barbara I would say has been pretty well cleaned
up.
   I'd say that the spill, the Amoco Cadiz, which was six times as
big as this, has been cleaned up.
   And so I _ we've got to aspire to standards that make me be able
to tell the people of Alaska and people that are concerned all over
this country, ``Yes, we can shoot for that standard, and we have
history to point to.''
   But I think what we do now will determine how fast we can say
that it has been done.
   And that's why we want to move as quickly _ we've go to _ all
right, last one. In the middle _ Owen. Sorry, Tom.
   Q. Can you tell me if you believe the political agreement
reached in Poland this week could be a model for political reform
throughout Eastern Europe? And can we anticipate another visit to
either Poland or Eastern Europe by you this summer, or this spring?
   A. No two Eastern European countries are the same.
   The striving for change in some, if not all, of these countries
is the same.
   But I would say that the roundtable development there in Poland
is very positive, and I would certainly commend the parties getting
together there.
   I go back to when we were there not very many months ago, and
many of you were with me on that trip.
   I think the situation has moved so fast since that trip that I
took a year or two ago that it's mind-boggling.
   And to think that you'd see Jaruzelski shaking hands with Lech
Walesa, we couldn't have predicted that a couple of years ago.
   Why? Because I was lectured very firmly about the
``Solidarnosc'' being, quote, outlawed, unquote.
   So, things are moving.
   And I think it's a sign of the change that democracy, and
democratization, if you will, and elections, and parliaments, and
congresses, and _ is on the move.
   And this is _ and recognition of a trade union's rights to
bargain _ this is all very encouraging.
   But what it means to the other Eastern European countries, Owen,
I simply can't tell you.
   In terms of my own plans, we have not formulated any plans yet.
   I'd love to go back to Poland sometime.
   I'd love to go back there.
   But there's no such plan.
   I really do have to run, and I'll just turn this over now to Sam
Skinner.
   And I know they'll _ and the congressmen and senators.
   Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
   A. Not at all.
   Well, good luck, and I hope you _
   Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
   A. We want to help, and we care about what's happening up there
in Alaska.

<HEAD>Science Teaching Needs Major Overhaul, Leaders Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American science education is becoming obsolete
and uncompetitive, but the new president of the National Science
Teachers Association says its overhaul represents a new frontier
that Americans will conquer.
   ``It has always been acceptable to say, `I never really
understood science,' and until we change that attitude and expect
that everyone will learn science, we won't move forward,'' said
Hans Andersen, professor of science and environmental education at
Indiana University at Bloomington.
   ``In spite of lots of poor science teachers, we have a lot of
teachers who are really making a significant difference with
students. ... This is a time for great optimism, and I believe that
this is a wave that is not going to do anything but get larger.''
   Andersen made his comments in an interview Thursday at the
association's 37th annual conference. As many as 11,000 people are
attending the Seattle gathering, which runs through Sunday.
   ``There's a good chance that turning around science education is
the next great frontier for this country .... Throughout our
history, Americans have risen up to conquer frontiers, and we can
do it again, and will,'' Andersen said.
   Only 7 percent of students who graduate from American high
schools have enough science to continue in a college science
program. In the Soviet Union, 85 percent are qualified for higher
education science courses, he said.
   By the end of the 1990s, he said, there will be 45,000 unfilled
jobs in science and engineering in this country.
   The lack of science expertise ``threatens the economy of the
country more than any single thing,'' said David Kennedy, Seattle
regional president of the association and a science adviser to the
Washington state superintendent of public instruction.
   Recent studies show American students do adequately memorizing
facts, but learning how to think critically _ how to establish and
test hypotheses and make inferences and conclusions _ isn't
happening, said LaMoine Motz, outgoing association president and
coordinator of science education at Oakland County schools in
Pontiac, Mich.
   Andersen and Motz cited several reasons: outdated teaching
methods and curricula; children who often aren't exposed to science
until secondary school, when it's often too late to hook their
interest; and lack of practical experience that would allow
students to understand and get excited about science applications
in the everyday world.
   ``One-third of our science teachers are teaching classes in a
discipline they weren't trained for,'' Andersen said. ``We need a
massive infusion of individually designed programs for teachers,
and for modernizing teaching techniques.''
   The association has set goals to provide teachers with more
support, develop new curricula and conduct educational research,
Motz said.
   Meanwhile, the biggest growth in the association's membership is
in elementary-school teachers _ a good sign, because it will help
fill teaching gaps at that level, Andersen said.
   The association also hopes to help overcome the predictions of
large numbers of job vacancies by making science more appealing to
women and minorities, he said.
   ``Women let boys dominate (in science) and teachers let them
dominate,'' Andersen said. ``We need more science teachers who know
how to empower girls, so that girls become convinced that science
really is a field for them.''

   Saying he felt like ``a pawn in a chess
game,'' Oliver North conceded today he lied to Congress after his
boss sent him against his will to a session where he denied
providing assistance to the Contras.
   ``Did you tell the truth at that meeting on Aug. 6, 1986?''
defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan asked North during his second day
of testimony at his criminal trial.
   ``No,'' said North. ``I ... went into the meeting not believing
it would be illegal not to tell Congress the truth. And that's why
I didn't think the meeting would be a good idea.''
   The session with the House Intelligence Committee was in the
White House Situation Room.
   The former White House aide said then-national security adviser
John Poindexter told him ``You go to the meeting with them, it's
informal.''
   ``I felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants,''
North said.
   North said he had wanted the Reagan White House to invoke
executive privilege against a looming congressional inquiry of
secret Contra aid in 1986, but was brushed aside by Poindexter. The
meeting with the House panel succeeded in fending off that inquiry.
   ``You start howling about executive privilege and it's just
going to make it more difficult for everybody,'' North quoted
Poindexter as telling him before the meeting.
   North said Poindexter was worried that a $100 million Contra aid
package which was about to be approved by Congress would be
imperiled if the administration refused to respond.
   Invoking executive privilege would have allowed North to refuse
to respond to questions.
   North is accused of obstructing Congress by telling the panel he
didn't give military advice to the Contras and didn't raise funds
for the rebels. The charge also accuses him of obstruction by
denying having had any contact with Contra supporter John Singlaub
for the previous 20 months, and by denying he advised or guided the
man who was his courier to the Contras, Robert Owen.
   North, contradicting earlier testimony by Poindexter's
predecessor, Robert McFarlane, also testified that he doctored
classified memos in November 1986 at McFarlane's direction.
   The National Security Council memos originally showed ``what I
had been doing at his direction in Central America'' for the
Contras, ``the delivery of arms, working with General (Richard V.)
Secord and ... building the resistance,'' North told the jury at
his criminal trial.
   Testifying for the second day in his own defense, North said
McFarlane first told him to alter the documents in 1985 in response
to congressional queries about news accounts that North was
assisting the Contras.
   In 1985, McFarlane ``handed me a list'' of half a dozen highly
sensitive memos North had written his boss detailing involvement
with the rebels ``and he said `these need to be fixed,''' North
said.
   His testimony directly contradicts McFarlane's, who told the
jury earlier that North came to him with a few unsolicited changes
in the memos. McFarlane said he threw them away.
   North also is accused of obstructing Congress and obstructing a
presidential inquiry by altering the memos.
   North said he balked at making the changes, telling McFarlane
that ``there must be 30 documents that are full'' of similar
references to assisting the Contras during a congressional ban on
military aid to the rebels.
   North said ``he just told me to fix the documents,'' but that
North didn't do so in 1985.
   ``Why not do what he said?'' asked North lawyer Brendan Sullivan.
   ``I didn't think it made any sense,'' replied North.
   In November 1986, as the Iran-Contra affair was surfacing,
McFarlane, by then out of the NSC, returned to help reconstruct an
account of the Iran arms initiative, and again asked North about
the memos, North said.
   ``Oh, by the way, did you ever take care of that other stuff?''
North said McFarlane asked him.
   ``I haven't taken care of it yet, but I will,'' North said he
replied. His former secretary, Fawn Hall, testified earlier that on
instructions from North, she altered the documents by deleting
numerous references to North's direct involvement with the Contras.
   The alterations ``were consistent with what he had earlier told
me to do,'' North testified.
   ``It never occurred to me it was unlawful,'' testified North.
   North also testified he tried unsuccessfully to persuade
McFarlane to refuse to answer congressional inquiries about the
Reagan administration's secret assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   North said he told McFarlane that ``we should be invoking
executive privilege'' after two letters came in from Congress in
August 1985. Also among the 12 counts against North are charges
that he lied to obstructed Congress in helping prepare written
responses which denied that the National Security Council was
involved in soliciting funds or offering tactical advice to the
Contras.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Personnel to Assist in Cleanup of Alaska Oil Spill</HEAD>

   President Bush ordered U.S. military personnel
today to assist in the cleanup of the huge oil spill off the coast
of Alaska. He predicted the effort would be ``massive, prolonged
and frustrating.''
   ``We all share the sorrow and concern of Alaskans,'' he said.
``Exxon's efforts standing alone are not enough.''
   Bush announced the decision during an appearance in the White
House briefing room at which he was accompanied by Cabinet members
and Alaskan members of Congress.
   Bush had been under pressure from members of Congress and
Alaskan officials to intervene in the oil spill cleanup.
   He said he had directed Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to ``make
available U.S. military forces personnel and equipment to assist in
the cleanup'' and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to
coordinate the whole operation.
   At the Pentagon, Defense Department officials said they had
postponed a decision on how many servicemen might be sent to Alaska
until a special assessment team ``determines the best way to apply
military support to the clean-up operation.''
   The Pentagon said its assessment team _ consisting of
engineering, environmental, medical and logistics specialists _
would depart for Valdez today. An Alaska Oil Spill Joint Task Force
was being established, headed by Lt. Gen. Thomas G., McInerney of
the Air Force, the commanding general of the Alaskan Air Command.
   The president insisted that ``We are not federalizing this
operation.''
   ``This should not relieve Exxon from any of its responsibilities
or liabilities,'' the president said.
   The Exxon tanker Valdez ran aground March 24, spilling 10
million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. The captain
of the tanker, Joseph J. Hazelwood, has been charged in the
incident.
   ``A lot has been done,'' Bush said when asked why it had taken
the federal government so long to intervene.
   Asked whether he was satisified with the cleanup efforts thus
far, Bush said, ``I'm not satisfied with anything about it ... I
feel very, very strongly about the damage to our environment there,
so I'm not totally satisfied.''
   Bush, who made environmental issues a key theme of his
presidential campaign, said the oil spill was an ``aberration'' and
that it should not affect U.S. oil exploration.
   ``I am not going to suggest that because of this that we should
rethink a policy of trying to get this country less dependent on
foreign oil,'' the president said.
   ``Our ultimate goal must be the complete restoration of the
ecology and the economy of Prince William Sound, including all of
its fish, marine mammals, birds and other wildlife.''
   He conceded the job ``will be massive, prolonged and
frustrating. Nothing we can do will resolve this problem in the
short term.''
   Throughout his remarks, Bush reiterated that Exxon bears the
ultimate responsibility for the oil spill. ``In addition to paying
damage claims against it, we urge Exxon to increase its local
hiring for the cleanup effort,'' he said.
   Bush also said he had directed White House staff to develop
plans to ``enable volunteers to participate in cleanup activities''
and that he hoped such a program would be in effect by summer.
   ``I kind of think the president has told the fishermen if they
want economic relief they should join the army,'' said Valdez Mayor
John Devens after watching Bush on television from his Washington
hotel room. ``He showed a lack of sensitivity as to what has
happened economically.''
   Even as Bush was announcing an increased federal effort, Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, was telling colleagues he
finds it alarming that the administration waited so long.
   ``A federal takeover of the cleanup effort was warranted after
it became clear on the day of the accident that Alyeska (the oil
pipeline service company) and Exxon had not respond in the manner
called for by the contingency plan and did not have sufficient
equipment available to contain the spill,'' Mitchell said.
   Witnesses at congressional hearings Thursday testified that
neither the industry nor the government was prepared for the
environmental disaster created by the oil spill.
   During a Senate hearing, Adm. Paul Yost, commandant of the Coast
Guard, cautioned against federal control.
   ``I am not prepared to federalize this spill,'' Yost said,
adding that such a move might leave it open for Exxon ``to close
their checkbook'' and force the government to assume cleanup costs.
   Yost did say that the Coast Guard was assuming greater direction
over the Exxon Corp.'s cleanup efforts, such as how it goes about
the cleanup, what equipment it uses and what the cleanup priorities
are.
   L.G. Rawls, chairman of Exxon Corp., told the Senate panel that
the petroleum giant ``will continue doing all we can to clean up
and mitigate the spill's effects.''
   Rawls maintained that the federal government should share some
of the blame for early delays in the cleanup because authorities
refused to approve use of a chemical dispersal agent until nearly
three days after the spill began.
   Yost defended the decision not to approve use of the chemical
and said Exxon only had ``a few thousand gallons'' of the chemical.
He called that amount a ``drop in the bucket'' given the size of
the spill.
   But he criticized Exxon for moving too slowly in the hours
immediately after the accident.
   A fisherman, choking back tears, described the disappointment
the Prince William Sound community felt toward Exxon's efforts.
   ``We expected Exxon to mobilize and clean up the spill and
assist the Sound communities with recovery efforts,'' said Pete
Isleib. ``The truth is that the people of Cordova reached into
their own treasury and began protecting uncontaminated areas of the
Sound while Exxon helped its out-of-town experts react.
   ``It is not a joke that the inevitable souvenir T-shirts were
deployed before the containment boom was around the Exxon Valdez.''

<HEAD>Mandela Calls For Black Unity In Letter To Zulu Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jailed African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela says he is deeply troubled by black
factional fighting, and he urged unity among anti-apartheid groups,
according to a letter released Friday.
   ``I consider it a serious indictment against all of us that we
are still unable to combine forces to stop the slaughter of so many
innocent lives,'' said the letter, released by Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, a Zulu leader at odds with the ANC.
   ``The (political) struggle is our life, and even though the
realization of our fondest dreams may not be at hand, we can
nevertheless make that struggle immensely enriching or absolutely
disastrous,'' according to the letter, which Buthelezi said he
received from Mandela last month.
   Buthelezi, leader of self-governing homeland of KwaZulu, read
the letter Thursday at the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly, one of the
few instances in recent years that Mandela has been quoted publicly.
   Mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-run
government. There has been widespread speculation that he could be
released within the next year.
   Mandela, 70, was treated for tuberculosis last year and was
moved to a suburban-style house on the grounds of the Victor
Verster Prison outside Cape Town.
   The ANC wages a bombing and sabotage campaign in its bid to
undermine South Africa's government.
   Buthelezi opposes apartheid, the government's policy of racial
separation, but the ANC and other militant anti-apartheid
organizations say he is too conservative because he does not
support sanctions, strikes, demonstrations and other
confrontational methods of political resistance.
   Mandela's letter called for reconciliation between the ANC and
Buthelezi, who also heads Inkatha. a 1.5 million-member political
organization.
   ``My fervent hope is to see, in due course, the restoration of
the cordial relations which existed between you and O.R. (ANC
President Oliver R. Tambo), and between the two organizations in
the '70s,'' Mandela wrote to Buthelezi.
   Inkatha has been involved in vicious faction fighting in Natal
Province for the past two years with supporters of the banned
United Democratic Front, which is the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition and a political ally of the ANC.
   More than 1,000 blacks have been killed in the battles around
the southeastern cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg.
   ``In my entire political career few things have distressed me as
to see our people killing one another as is now happening,''
Mandela wrote.
   ``The most challenging task facing the (black) leadership today
is that of national unity,'' he added. ``At no other time in our
history has it become so crucial for our people to speak with one
voice.

   Workers have plastered over the words
``white'' and ``colored'' carved in the courthouse wall over old
drinking fountains.
   ``I hope this is over so we can move from this to something more
constructive,'' said Ben Chaney, a Laurel resident whose son,
James, was slain in Neshoba County in 1964 along with two other
civil rights workers.
   Jones County NAACP chapter President Manuel Jones asked the
county supervisors Monday night to remove the nonfunctional
fountains or mask the words permanently. The fountains have stood
on the courthouse lawn in Ellisville since 1907.
   But the Board of Supervisors, minus its only black member,
Jerome Wyatt, tabled a motion to alter the fountains, delaying
action until board attorney Tony Thaxton could discuss the issue
with the state Department of Archives and History.
   The courthouse is a registered Mississippi Historical Landmark
and alterations to registered buildings must be approved through
the department by a written permit.
   But supervisors then acted without a permit this week and gave a
county work crew the go-ahead to cover the engravings.
   Supervisor Thurman Dikes said Thursday that the supervisors had
approved the plastering work and he didn't think their attorney was
aware of the decision.
   ``Those fountains were controversial a long time ago,'' Wyatt
said, explaining that the state Department of Archives and History
had asked for the fountains for the state History Museum's civil
rights exhibit about two years ago and the county board agreed.
   ``But people in the area complained about history being removed
from the county, so we left them alone.''

   Oil from the Exxon Valdez threatened a
national park and oozed through barriers protecting fisheries as
President Bush today ordered U.S. armed forces to assist in the
cleanup of Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   State officials said they welcomed help to move equipment, but
said beach cleanup was futile now. They also said they worked out
an agreement between Exxon and the Coast Guard to transfer more
management responsibility to the federal agency.
   Exxon will handle contracts and purchases and the Coast Guard
will direct field activity, said Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the
Department of Environmental Conservation.
   ``It's a resolution of what we thought was a real logjam,''
Kelso said.
   With the nation's worst crude oil spill in its third week, Exxon
made a second public apology and the tanker's captain made bail on
charges that he was drunk when his ship went aground.
   The Good Friday spill of 10.1 million gallons has killed
thousands of seabirds and otters in the snowy landscape on the
central Alaskan coast. Fishermen have lost millions of dollars.
   And despite cleanup efforts by industry, government and private
citizens, the spill has spread to more than 2,600 square miles.
   ``It's just immense,'' Jim Hayden, who is coordinating the
cleanup for the state, said Thursday. ``I don't think a spill of
this size is controllable.''
   Bush today directed Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to ``make
available U.S. military forces personnel and equipment to assist in
the cleanup.'' The president also directed Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner to oversee the cleanup effort, but he said, ``We are
not federalizing this operation.''
   ``This should not relieve Exxon from any of its responsibilities
or liabilities,'' Bush said in the White House briefing room,
accompanied by Cabinet members and Alaska's congressional
contingent.
   He conceded the job of cleaning up the oil that has washed up
along the Alaskan coast with devastating effect on wildlife ``will
be massive, prolonged and frustrating. Nothing we can do will
resolve this problem in the short term.''
   Kelso said the military was welcome to help move equipment, but
there was no need to line the shore with troops.
   ``We think that deployment of equipment and material that are
promised are the key elements right now,'' Kelso said. ``More
people will be needed for shoreline cleanup but that is not what
the proper focus should be right now.''
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium of oil companies
that owns and operates the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline and
the Valdez terminal, announced Thursday that it would immediately
begin requiring random drug and alcohol testing aboard all vessels
using the terminal.
   Alyeska also said it would require tugboat escorts for all
entering and departing vessels to a point beyond Bligh Reef, where
the Exxon Valdez ran aground.
   Late Thursday the oily sheen was reported lapping at the rocks
on islands near Kenai Fjords National Park, a remote refuge 100
miles southwest of Valdez. Ron Smith, a spokesman for a
federal-state cleanup effort, said new booms were being put up to
protect the area of inlets and fjords.
   Closer to the spill site, local fishermen continued their fight
to save the salmon fishery at three-mile-long Sawmill Bay, using
fishing nets to corral the oil and ``super sucker'' vacuum trucks
to remove it and protect millions of salmon fry.
   Rand Little, product manager for the Prince William Sound
Aquaculture Corp., said oil breached one of three booms protecting
the young salmon. Fishermen were able to repair the breach before
damage was done.
   But fishermen worried about high tides this weekend that could
lift the oil over the booms and complained that they couldn't empty
their oil-filled barges because of a lack of pumps.
   The frustration with the slow cleanup wasn't confined to area
fishermen. Alaska legislators have introduced several bills
designed to better prepare the state in the event of future spills.
And Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said his two-day tour of Prince
William Sound convinced him oil industry contingency plans for a
spill were ``essentially a fraud on the public.''
   ``The industry effort to clean up this spill ... is almost
nonexistent,'' said Miller, head of the congressional subcommittee
overseeing oil exploration.
   Exxon Chairman L.G. Rawl issued a second apology for the spill,
caused when the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef outside the
normal shipping channel, but said the company's response to the
accident was ``immediate and thorough.''
   On the East Coast, the captain of the tanker that spread the
oily disaster was free after his bail was reduced to $25,000 from
$1 million. The judge said the former skipper, Joseph Hazelwood of
Huntington, N.Y., was unlikely to flee.
   Hazelwood, 42, faces charges in Alaska of operating a ship while
drunk, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil; an
extradition request from Alaska is pending. The misdemeanors carry
a maximum penalty of 2\ years in prison and a $10,000 fine upon
conviction.
   Hazelwood had turned over control of the tanker to a third mate,
who was not certified to pilot the boat in the sound.
   Bodies of birds and otters are sinking below the surface and
washing out to sea, fish and game department spokeswoman Sheila
Nickerson said. One survey vessel counted 200 dead birds along one
shore, she said.
   The Animal Rescue Center has received 138 birds, mostly loons,
ducks, mergansers and cormorants. Four birds have been cleaned and
released, 43 have died. About half the 68 otters brought in have
died.

<HEAD>Post Office Seeking Ways to Save Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hiring permanent part-time workers and
contracting out some services may have to be considered as ways to
save money in postal operations, Postmaster General Anthony Frank
told a Senate subcommittee Friday.
   Rising health care costs and other expenses are eating up
savings realized through automation, and the massive postal agency
needs to look throughout its operations to find ways to cut costs,
Frank told the subcommittee on federal services, post office and
civil service.
   ``So far this year, while we still anticipate that revenues will
exceed expenses by a small margin, we have not done as well as we
had planned,'' Frank reported.
   The Postal Service had planned for a surplus this year based on
the 25-cent postage rate that took effect just a year ago.
   Frank has said previously that he expected the agency to drop
into the red in 1990 and face another rate increase in 1991,
maintaining the recent cycle of increasing postage costs every
three years.
   When postal managers applied for the current rates they were
overly optimistic in their projections in an effort to achieve the
``round figure'' of a quarter, Frank told the subcommittee.
   In the real world, costs have exceeded those expectations,
resulting in a smaller surplus than had been hoped for. Also
affecting the postal budget was legislation last year requiring the
agency to contribute funds toward reducing the federal debt.
   Frank told the subcommittee that in order to maintain universal
postal service, and to save money without affecting the current
postal employees, his managers are having to re-evaluate all
operations of the agency.
   ``Maybe we need to look at permanent part-time people,'' he
commented, noting that such workers are common in other countries.
The Netherlands, for example, hires many housewives to deliver mail
four hours per day, Frank said.
   Another possibility is contracting out some work. The Postal
Service currently uses contractors to handle about 15 percent of
its rural routes, and may need to expand that share and consider
hiring contractors for other tasks, Frank said.
   Use of bar codes on all letters by 1995 and other improvements
in automation will help speed the mail and save money, but those
are long-term benefits and not things that will affect the agency
overnight, he said.
   In addition, automation requires a considerable investment,
Frank said. For example, several years ago managers bought machines
designed to read the nine-digit ZIP codes. Those codes were delayed
by Congress and never become popular with the public, so the
machines are now being converted to perform other tasks.

<TEXT>
   The trial of a 42-year-old man
suspected in the 1986 killing of Prime Minister Olof Palme will
start May 29, court officials said Friday.
   The trial of Christer Pettersson is expected to last at least
four weeks, they said.
   Pettersson, arrested Dec. 14, has denied he shot Palme.
   Prosecutors said they have enough evidence to try Pettersson,
who has a previous manslaughter conviction, a long record of petty
crime and a history of mental disturbance and drug and alcohol
abuse.
   The prosecutors said they plan to file charges within a month
but declined to say what the exact charges will be.
   Palme, shot Feb. 28, 1986, was a controversial figure at home
and abroad, a committed socialist and a champion of Third World
liberation movements. The killing stunned Sweden, where no
political leader had been slain for 200 years.

<TEXT>
   Riot police clamped down Friday on
striking shipyard workers and radical students whom President Roh
Tae-woo charges are allied in a plot to oust his government and
install a communist administration.
   Police said they arrested four strike leaders, bringing to 19
the number detained this week. They continued to hunt for another
12 leaders Friday, the day after senior government officials
ordered they suppress leftists accused of arousing workers.
   In Seoul, 2,500 students demanding Roh's resignation rallied at
four schools and pelted police with hundreds of firebombs.
   One bomb went astray and burned out a store in front of Sungshil
University. No casualties were reported.
   Hundreds of riot police firing tear gas moved into Sungkyunkwan
University, near downtown Seoul, to disperse about 700 students who
tried to march off the campus to support the Hyundai strikers.
   ``Overthrow the Roh regime, which stifles workers' rights,''
shouted students protesting police action against strikers at South
Korea's largest shipyard, the Hyundai Heavy Industries in the
southeastern industrial city of Ulsan.
   Shipyard operations remained far below normal Friday, although
thousands of riot police increased protection for non-strikers.
   Police said protesters hurling firebombs set an Ulsan police
checkpoint afire in a pre-dawn attack. No serious property damage
or injuries were reported.
   According to Hyundai officials, 2,000 workers and sympathizers
staged scattered protests in Ulsan. News reports said riot police
brandishing truncheons and shields chased them into alleys and
sidestreets. Demonstrators appeared subdued, apparently because of
increased police activity, the reports said.
   Police squads patrolled residential areas and company
dormitories they closed Thursday because militant workers were
using them as hideouts.
   The police also blocked all traffic to the city, checking buses
and other vehicles to keep out dissidents and radical students from
other parts of the country, state TV reported.
   Hyundai's labor troubles began in December when militant workers
left a company-sanctioned labor union to strike for more pay and
better working conditions.
   About 2,000 workers from the company's 20,000-member workforce
have demonstrated daily since riot police stormed the shipyard
March 30 to end the 109-day strike.
   Seoul demonstrators also shouted slogans supporting dissident
clergyman Moon Ik-hwan, who made an unauthorized trip to North
Korea last week and held talks with North Korean President Kim Il
Sung on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula.
   Government officials say the Rev. Moon will be arrested and
charged with violating security regulations when he returns. Moon
is in Tokyo and told reporters he plans to return home by Thursday.
   Dissidents and students are organizing rallies to welcome Moon,
but police say they will block them.

   Authorities have released one of
the five kidnappers of Dutch beer baron Alfred Heineken after
serving two-thirds of his sentence, the Justice Ministry said.
   Martin Erkamp, 25, who in 1984 got an eight-year jail term, was
freed on parole late last month, a ministry spokesman said Thursday
in exchange for anonymity in line with ministry practice.
   The kidnapping of Heineken and his chauffer, Ab Doderer,
captivated the nation for three weeks in November 1983. The two
were freed unharmed after the reported payment of $11.5 million.
Four-fifths of the ransom has reportedly been recovered.
   Three kidnappers remain in jail, serving terms of 10 to 12
years, while the fifth is on the loose after escaping from a
psychiatric hospital more than four years ago.
   On Thursday, the 65-year-old Heineken, one of the Netherlands'
wealthiest people, announced he would retire this summer as
chairman of his brewery's board.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civilian unemployment fell to 5.0 percent last
month _ the lowest rate in more than 15 years _ even as the pace of
job growth slowed, the government said Friday.
   The report painted a picture of a moderating economy influenced
heavily by a tight labor market. Nonfarm payroll jobs rose by
180,000, down 100,000 from February.
   Another indication of moderation: The average manufacturing work
week fell from 41.1 hours to February to 40.9 hours last month.
   Amid the signs of moderation, however, were indications of
increasing inflationary pressures on the economy:
   _Average hourly earnings rose at a 5.0 percent annual rate.
   _Construction jobs fell sharply. The drop was blamed on rising
interest rates.
   _A record 63 percent of the working-age population had jobs, but
analysts took that as a sign of possible labor shortages down the
road. Some 117.1 million Americans had jobs in March; just 6.1
million were out of work but looking.
   The March unemployment rate was down from 5.1 percent in
February and was the lowest since 4.9 percent in December 1973.
   Some economists saw in Friday's Labor Department report signs of
the ``stagflation'' that cripped the economy as the decade began _
slow economic growth in the face of moderate inflation.
   `om 4.5
percent in February to 4.6 percent in March. Among all adult men,
unemployment dipped to 4.2 percent in March from 4.5 percent.
   Unemployment among all teen-agers dropped to 13.7 percent from
14.8 percent but the jobless rate among black teen-gers was 31.6
percent, down from 32.4 percent in February.
   The unemployment rate among black adult men fell to 9.8 percent
from 10.5 percent; for black women it was 9.1 percent, down from
10.3 percent.
   Among Hispanics, the March unemployment rate was 6.5 percent,
down from 6.8 percent.

<HEAD>Activists Urge Protests Against Exxon Because Of Oil Spill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tanker Spill Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A Connecticut lawmaker is urging consumers to boycott Exxon
products May 2 to protest the Alaska oil spill, and other
environmentalists are urging their own protests.
   ``Many people are outraged and frustrated over this incident,''
state Sen. Michael Meotti said Thursday. ``This is an oportunity
for everyone, as consumers in the free marketplace, to make a point
to Exxon.''
   In Erie, Pa., a couple are trying to organize an ongoing
boycott. And in Florida, marine biologist Jack Rudlow had a more
direct way of making his point. He packed his Exxon credit cards in
an oil-filled plastic bag Thursday and mailed them to the company.
   Rudloe, an author and environmental activist from Panacea, Fla.,
said he hoped others would join his protest.
   ``It makes a very interesting package to see this Exxon card
swilling around in black oil, and I think it gets the point
across,'' he said. ``They say a picture is worth a thousand words,
and this beats all the rhethoric.''
   The protests come two weeks after the tanker Exxon Valdez ran
aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound, disgorging 10.1 million
gallons of crude oil. Alaska officials, who are angry with Exxon's
handling of the cleanup, said Thursday that less than 4 percent of
the oil has been recovered.
   Exxon Chairman L.G. Rawl, in a statement to a congressional
committee Thursday, again apologized on behalf of his company for
the spill, but said Exxon's response was ``immediate and thorough.''
   In Erie, Pa., Mary Machuga, 34, said she and her husband, Mike,
38, began campaigning for a boycott this week out of frustration
and have been getting messages of support.
   ``We have not been real activists, but we finally decided it's
time to do something,'' she said. ``And, luckily, people from all
over the country have felt the same way.''
   Meotti said he is working with Connecticut environmental groups
to spread word of the one-day boycott. He said the economic impact
on Exxon may be small, but the gesture will send a clear message.

<HEAD>Law Would Allows for Religious Education, Alternative Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-awaited draft law reforming Soviet
practices on religion removes a Stalin-era prohibition on group
religious education and opens limited alternatives to bearing arms
in military service.
   New legislation that has been in the works for at least 18
months will reeplace a directive put into force 60 years ago at the
height of the Soviet Union's anti-religious fervor and for the
first time give churches legal standing to fight official abuse, an
official said Friday.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the as-yet uncompleted
draft legislation from religious dissidents. Tatyana
Belokovylskaya, chief of legal affairs for the government's Council
on Religious Affairs, said it was an authentic document that had
been presented to church authorities for discussion.
   ``This is a big step forward in the democratization of relations
between the church and state,'' she said.
   Believers have been persecuted for years despite laws that
guarantee freedom of worship, but Ms. Belokovylskaya said the new
legislation will give them a chance to fight back.
   ``In order to protect themselves, religious organizations have
to have legal standing. They are not only presented with rights,
but the ability to protect themselves,'' she said.
   But dissidents say it doesn't go far enough to protect them from
persecution, or to separate the government from the Communist
Party's official atheism. Dissidents also have said they lack faith
in church leaders who have cooperated with the government.
   Officials are completing work on the document a year after
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Patriarch Pimen, head of the
Russian Orthodox church. That meeting, the first of its kind in 40
years, symbolized Gorbachev's effort to ease restrictions on
believers and draw them into his reform process.
   As a sign of authorities' more liberal attitude toward religion,
the Moscow News reported that 1,610 new groups of believers were
registered in 1988 compared with 104 in the previous year. It said
authorities handed back 937 religious buildings that had been taken
away and granted permission for 143 new churches and mosques to be
built.
   When finished, the draft law will be presented to the Soviet
Union's new Congress of People's Deputies parliament.
   Ms. Belokovylskaya said changes are still being made in the law,
but several key points have been decided. They include provisions
allowing for alternatives to bearing arms, group religious
education, and establishing the legal standing of churches. In
addition, Ms. Belokovylskaya said a more recent draft of the law
permits religious organizations to engage in charitable work.
   Under the Stalin-era directive that still serves as the model
for laws in each of the 15 Soviet republics, believers may not
organize any charitable activity or church groups. They face
prosecution for obtaining group religious training for themselves
or their children.
   Young men who refuse compulsory military service face terms in
prison camps. All religious groups must be registered with the
government, and only can be approved if they consist of 20 or more
adults.
   ``Citizens may teach and learn religion in a private manner as
an individual, as well as together with others, including at home
and through a religious society,'' the draft law said.
   Ms. Belokovylskaya said that ``absolutely'' allowed for the
group religious training of children.
   Religious organizations also will be allowed to use the official
media, she said.
   Ms. Belokovylskaya said alternative service permitted by courts
on an individual basis was a controversial point, but ``all the
same, we are reducing the size of our military. This idea has its
time and place.''
   Types of alternative service have not yet been established, but
may be based on the experience of countries such as Hungary and
East Germany that provide for work in military hospitals or
construction where believers would not be required to take up arms,
she said.
   Ms. Belokovylskaya said officials still are considering ways to
provide the legal protection afforded by official registration
while meeting the demands by some evangelical Christians that they
not be required to register.
   Dissidents who have rejected the proposed reforms as
insufficient wrote their own law at a three-day conference in
Moscow at the end of March.
   Former political prisoner Alexander Ogorodnikov complained the
draft law provides more freedom but leaves final decisions in the
hands of Soviet administrators. ``We know what kind of
administration that is,'' he said.
   Dissidents also included a section of law separating the
government and schools not only from religion, but from atheism as
well.
   Believers long have complained the Soviet Union's official
atheism, established in the constitution as a right to conduct
``atheist propaganda,'' begins with training as early as
kindergarten.

   There are certain things elected officials
simply do not do _ and Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono says one of
them is to appear on a show where a comedian poses as your ex-wife
and sings ``I've Got You, Babe.''
   Bono departed from a Thursday taping of ``Friday Night Videos''
after Judy Tenuta strolled onto the set dressed as Cher and burst
into song, a spokeswoman for the NBC-TV program confirmed Friday.
   ``Sonny felt uncomfortable. He felt as mayor, he should stay
within certain boundaries,'' said spokeswoman Diane DeStefano. ``He
thought Judy was funny, but as mayor, he felt it would hurt his
credibility.''
   According to Tenuta, Sonny was ``kind of moody'' when taping
began and things went downhill from there. After her appearance as
Cher, Bono said he was leaving for a cup of coffee and never
returned, she said.
   ``The director comes to me and says, `Sonny is freaking out. He
says he doesn't want to be a straight man; he's the mayor of Palm
Springs,''' Tenuta said Friday. ``I said, `Believe me, the mayor of
Palm Springs is not the straight man. He's the joke.'''
   Tenuta completed the taping by herself, at one point using a
cameraman with a wig as a Sonny stand-in. The program will probably
air in its entirety on April 28, said DeStefano.

   Marlee Matlin, who won an Oscar in 1986
for her performance in ``Children of a Lesser God,'' says speaking
at last year's Academy Awards signaled a dramatic change in her
career.
   The deaf actress, 23, said she had been afraid to pursue roles
that required her to speak until she decided to present the
nominees for best actor last year by talking instead of using sign
language.
   Her action was criticized by some hearing impaired
organizations, who argued that she gave the impression that every
deaf person could speak.
   ``I felt sad for those individuals who did not or would not
respect me for what I did, but I decided I'm not going to let other
people change me,'' Matlin said in Friday's editions of The
Nashville Banner.
   Matlin's newest film, ``Bridge To Silence,'' was an added
challenge, said the actress, who has been deaf since the age of 19
months.
   ``It was a great deal different because I've never acted and
spoke at the same time,'' she said. ``And I would do it again and
again and again if I was offered the opportunity.''

   Jackie Mason has quit the Friars Club in a flap

   It began six months ago, when a board member approached Mason
about accepting the award.
   ``They cornered us and said, `Will you please say yes?' So we
did,'' Jill Rosenfeld, Mason's manager, said Friday from London,
where Mason is appearing in his one-man show, ``The World According

   But the board apparently hadn't authorized the invitation and
went ahead with plans to honor Alan King.
   Rosenfeld said when she learned that Mason had not been chosen,
``I asked them to write a note saying, `We're sorry, a mistake was
made.'''
   No note arrived, so Mason resigned.
   Jean-Pierre Trebot, executive director, said in a telephone
interview that he had no idea why Mason quit and that his letter
contained no explanation.
   Rosenfeld said Mason didn't want the incident to reflect poorly
on King, who will be honored May 13 at the Waldorf-Astoria.

   About 1,500 Japanese longshoremen demanding pay
raises and shorter working hours have gone on strike, halting
container shipping at nine ports, union officials said Friday.
   The strike that began Wednesday at container yards at ports
including Yokohama, Kobe and Osaka blocked the entrance and exit of
290,000 tons of containers a day, said Masaya Tamada, a labor union
spokesman for the National Council of Dockworkers Unions of Japan.
   ``Although other sections at each port are functioning normally,
the halt of containers would affect people's everyday life because
the circulation of goods, from foodstuffs to machinery, stops,''
Tamada added.
   There are 150,000 longshoremen in Japan. The Japan Port and
Harbor Association's labor union has 50,000 members, according to
Tamada.
   The union demanded a $303 to $380 increase in monthly salaries,
or a $1,970 monthly salary for the average worker. The Japan Harbor
Transportation Association, composed of 1,600 employers, offered
$1,700, Tamada said.

   A destructive earthquake seems almost certain
to strike the eastern United States sometime in the next two
decades, a Senate subcommittee was told Friday.
   While scientists cannot predict when or where the quake might
hit, or its strength, they consider one almost sure to occur before
the year 2010, according to Robert L. Ketter, director of the
National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research.
   Both Ketter and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., cited the Armenian
quake in December as raising attention to similar dangers in the
United States.
   Quakes in the eastern part of the United States have received
less attention than those in the West because the strongest eastern
tremors came before the nation was heavily developed and thus led
to few losses of lives.
   Ketter told the subcommittee that while the likelihood of a
quake in any particular place is low, ``the probability of one
occurring somewhere in the Eastern United States before the year
2000 can be considered better than 75 percent to 95 percent. Before
the year 2010, nearly 100 percent.''
   The potential for quakes in Armenia was also well known, yet
lack of preparation left thousands dead and massive damage,
Cranston told the Senate subcommittee on science, technology and
space.
   ``The hazard in many parts of the U.S. is no less certain than
it was in Armenia,'' said Cranston, citing quakes that have caused
death and major damage in California, Idaho, Kentucky, Alaska and
other states.
   ``The challenge that faces us now is to use our new capability
and capacity for earthquake hazards reduction before we have to
face the public and explain our inaction _ as the Soviets now
must,'' Cranston said.
   The senator's comments came in support of a bill to strengthen
the national earthquake hazards program, including a transfer of
that activity to the U.S. Geological Survey. Currently the
earthquake program is part of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
   Cranston noted that earthquakes, once thought of as primarily a
California and Alaska problem, are now known to be a major danger
to many states.
   Perhaps the most powerful quake ever to strike the United States
occurred in a series of tremors in 1811-1812 that rocked the New
Madrid, Mo., region, Ketter testified.
   In addition, severe quakes in the 18th century and 19th century
struck Charleston, S.C.; Boston; under the ocean near New York
City, and in the Charlevoix region of Quebec, Ketter told the
subcommittee.
   Compounding the problem is the fact that in the eastern states
underlying rocks are older and more dense. Thus, reported Ketter,
``earthquakes in the East can cause damage over a much larger area
than in the West.''
   One of the 1811 quakes in Missouri, for example, had a strength
similar to the 1906 San Francisco quake. The temblor in Missouri,
however, affected an area 15 times larger than the California quake.
   Lacy E. Suiter, chairman of the Central U.S. Earthquake
Consotrium, testified that there is a 40 percent to 63 percent
chance of a strong quake occurring in the Ned Madrid, Mo., region
by the turn of the century.
   Ketter said that if the 1811-1812 Missouri quakes were to occur
today, the death toll could approach 5,000 people with massive
destruction in such communities as Memphis, Tenn.; Paducah, Ky.;
Carbondale, Ill.; Evansville, Ind.; Poplar Bluff, Mo., and Little
Rock, Ark.

<HEAD>Bush Finds Unresolved Iran-Contra Questions Won't Go Away</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Those questions about George Bush's role in
the Iran-Contra affair just won't go away. They dogged him during
the presidential campaign and they hit him again Friday. But Bush
is standing fast, refusing to offer any new details.
   ``Please, accept it when I said I don't want to talk about it
any more,'' said the president when reporters raised the issue anew
during a briefing on the Alaska oil spill.
   ``Look, we're having a briefing on Alaska,'' he said, sounding a
bit testy over the attempt to get him to talk about an
extraordinary document entered into evidence at the trial of Oliver
North.
   The document outlined the workings of the secret effort to keep
supplies flowing to the Nicaraguan Contras despite a congressional
ban on aid. It began with the statement that ``the United States
has admitted for purposes of this trial the following facts to be
true.''
   The account suggested that Bush, then vice president, had a more
active role in that supply effort than has been publicly disclosed.
   It said Bush met with the president of Honduras in May 1985 to
inform him of President Reagan's decision to speed up delivery of
U.S. military aid to that country. Former National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane has testified that Reagan personally approved the
secret deal to slip extra aid to Honduras as one of several ``quid
pro quo'' arrangements with other countries in exchange for support
for the Contras.
   The document linked the U.S. aid to Honduran cooperation in
assisting the Contras, but it did not say whether Bush was aware of
that condition.
   Exactly what Bush was aware of in those conspiratorial days in
the White House basement has never been clear.
   Bush has denied having any knowledge of a diversion of Iran
arms-sales proceeds to the Contras, although he admitted knowing
about the clandestine arms sales to Iran and said he supported the
initiative with certain reservations. Donald Gregg, his national
security adviser during the period in question, said he did not
tell Bush about the Contra resupply effort that Gregg had learned
about from a one-time CIA associate.
   Former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. pressed Bush
repeatedly during the campaign for the 1988 GOP presidential
nomination to say more about his role in the effort to help the
Contras.
   ``If you can't answer your friends,'' said Haig, during a
Republican candidate debate ``what in heaven's name is going to
happen next November if you are our standard-bearer and these
Democrats get after you on this subject?''
   Candidate Bush liked to cite his experience as Reagan's No. 2.
   ``I've been co-pilot for seven years,'' he said.
   ``Were you in the cockpit or were you on an economy ride in the
back of the plane?'' retorted Haig.
   Republican rival Bob Dole was equally determined but no more
successful.
   Would he release some of the documents pertaining to his role,
Bush was asked by his Republican rivals.
   ``I think some of those are classified,'' he said.
   Asked whether he would allow them to be declassified, the vice
president replied, ``I'm perfectly willing.''
   On one point Bush was absolutely correct. He said no Republican
would beat him by making an issue of Iran-Contra.
   No Democrat would either, hard as they would try.
   ``Where was George?'' Democrats chanted at their convention when
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy used that refrain to question what role Bush
had in Iran-Contra as well as other policy issues during his term
as vice president.
   Safely elected and inaugurated and now happily in residence at
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Bush still can't seem to kick those
Iran-Contra questions.
   No longer No. 2, he appeared in the White House briefing room to
talk about the Alaskan oil spill.
   He outlined steps he was taking to assist the cleanup and then
invited questions.
   ``Fire away,'' he said.
   ``How do you reconcile your efforts to arrange third-country
military aid for the Contras with the spirit of the ban by Congress
on aid to the rebels?'' was the first question.
   ``I'm not going to comment on any aspect of the North trial,''
responded the president in measured tones.
   He expressed concern about prejudicing the trial of the former
White House aide and said the information had already been examined
by the special prosecutor and congressional committees that
investigated the case.
   ``All the material that you seem to be referring to ... has been
available to the independent counsel and the Iran-Contra committee
and has been reviewed by them for any special significance.''
   But it remains largely unavailable to the public and was never
available either to Bush's campaign rivals or to the voters in 1988.

   Ethiopia's army and anti-government rebels
each claimed victories in separate battles in northern Ethiopia.
   The government said Thursday its troops defeated Eritrean
People's Liberation Front rebels during an offensive March 22-26
near the strategic city of Keren in Ethiopia's northernmost
province of Eritrea.
   The report by the state-run radio station did not quantify the
rebels reportedly slain or the weapons and other equipment
allegedly captured.
   The Ethiopian People's Democratic Front said over Voice of
Tigray Revolution radio to have killed and wounded 44 government
troops during a battle March 24 near Robit in Wollo province.
   It is impossible to verify government or rebel claims in the
northern fighting, which has been going on for as long as 28 years
in the northern provinces.

<TEXT>
   A Colombian judge brought to the United States by
the Drug Enforcement Agency to protect her from a Colombian drug
lord has sued The Detroit News, claiming the newspaper defamed her.
   Judge Consuelo Sanchez-Duran and her husband, Augusto Sanabria,
seek at least $10,000 in the lawsuit, filed Thursday in Wayne
County Circuit Court.
   The lawsuit claims a Feb. 12 story defamed the couple and
endangered their lives.
   The story said Sanchez-Duran left Colombia after her life was
threatened for ordering the arrest of Pablo Escobar, head of
Colombia's largest cocaine ring. It also said the judge had 24-hour
guards paid by the U.S. government.
   Escobar hasn't been arrested and is believed to be in Colombia.
He also has been indicted in the United States.
   The story quoted a ``highly placed source'' as saying a team of
15 elite police officers had been assigned to protect the judge. It
also said tenants of the apartment building in which she lives are
concerned over her presence.
   Sanchez-Duran claimed the story ``was unnecessary and dangerous,
recklessly placing (the couple) and the general public in a
position of harm.''
   The lawsuit names columnist Pete Waldmeir and News Executive
Editor Robert H. Giles. A woman who answered the telephone in
Giles' office Friday said the newspaper hasn't been served notice
of the lawsuit.
   At the time the story was published, Giles said the News
believed it did the right thing.
   ``You balance whatever the presumed risk to the judge against
whether the community needs to know about this, ... and there was
no question'' to run the story, he said.
   The newspaper printed the name of the apartment complex where
she was living. ``We recognized that many of the people in the
current Detroit location already knew she was there,'' Giles said.

   A deputy culture minister in President
Robert Mugabe's government was sentenced Friday to eight months in
jail for cheating a dance troupe out of $225.
   Charles Ndhlovu, deputy minister of youth, sport and culture,
said he will appeal his sentence to the Supreme Court.
   Ndhlovu was convicted in February of defrauding the government
of $225 when he worked as assistant director in 1982 at a
state-owned film production unit. The money was intended for an
Indian dance troupe featured in a film.
   Last month, two other government ministers resigned after

<TEXT>
   Anti-drug crusader Nancy Reagan says she felt
depressed after watching a SWAT team raid a fortified house where
police said drugs are sold.
   ``I always see the other end, kids who are in rehabilitation,''
said the former first lady, whose motto for children is ``just say
no'' to drugs.
   The raid took place Thursday night in the city's impoverished
South Central section, where street gangs shoot it out nearly every
day.
   Mrs. Reagan, who wore jeans, running shoes, and a police
windbreaker with ``Nancy'' on the front, remarked on the sparse
furnishings in the house and the bleak lives of those arrested.
   ``It was very depressing,'' she said. ``It's awful to see when
you think that these people have no lives. It's very sad.''
   Mrs. Reagan looked on with Police Chief Daryl Gates as a SWAT
team stormed the green stucco frame house with barred windows and
door. No weapons were found, but a small quantity of suspected rock
cocaine was seized and 14 people were arrested.
   Earlier in the evening, she witnessed undercover officers buying
drugs. She did not talk to any of those arrested, but one of them
said, ``Hello Mrs. Reagan.''
   Commenting on security procedures employed for the raid, Gates
said, ``I'm sure the Secret Service agents have aged about 10
years.''
   Mrs. Reagan interjected, ``along with my husband,'' who was home
in Bel-Air.

   The government Friday approved its first
communications satellite program at a cost of $370 million, as
Spain prepares for its Summer Olympics and world's fair in 1992.
   The plan calls for three Hispasat satellites whose
telecommunications and television range would cover Spain and most
of Latin America and the United States, said Transport and
Communications Minister Jose Barrionuevo.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's socialist government has placed
high priority on modernizing communications before the 1992 Summer
Olympics in Barcelona and Seville's Expo '92, a world's fair to
commemorate Christopher Columbus' voyage to the New World.
   The first satellite will be launched in December 1991 and the
second in April 1992, with the third held in reserve, Barrionuevo
said.
   Companies in the running to build the satellites include Hughes
Aerospace of the United States. The U.S. Titan or Delta rockets or
the French-built Ariane will launch them.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Calls For UN Supervision of Vietnamese Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Khmer Rouge, which governed
Cambodia by famine and massacre before the Vietnamese invaded a
decade ago, urged on Friday that the United Nations supervise
Vietnam's troop withdrawal.
   It also demanded the Hanoi-sponsored government of Cambodia be
replaced by a coalition including the three resistance factions, of
which the Khmer Rouge is the most powerful.
   Fear of the Khmer Rouge regaining power has been at the heart of
negotiations for a settlement.
   France accepted a request from Prince Norodom Sihanouk, once
Cambodia's ruler and now leader of the resistance alliance, that it
hold an international conference on the future of Cambodia.
Sihanouk also has recommended U.N. supervision of the withdrawal.
   Vietnam said Wednesday would pull out of Cambodia by Sept. 30
after nearly 11 years of occupation, and urged that China and other
countries stop aiding the resitance.
   The occupation blocks diplomatic relations with the United
States, from which Hanoi hopes to get aid, and hinders trade
relations with non-communist neighbors. China has linked withdrawal
to resumption of normal relations with the Soviet Union, Vietnam's
ally.
   A statement Wednesday by Vietnam, Laos and the Cambodian
government of Premier Hun Sen proposed that India, Poland and
Canada monitor departure. It rejected demands that the Hun Sen
administration be dissolved.
   In its first statement on the Vietnamese plan, the Khmer Rouge
said through its clandestine radio that ``the entire Cambodian
people absolutely cannot accept the announcement of a unilateral
troop pullout of the Hanoi Vietnamese aggressors.''
   Vietnamese soldiers entered Cambodia in December 1978 and ousted
the Khmer Rouge, under whose rule of less than four years an
estimated one-fourth of Cambodia's 8 million people were executed
or died of hunger.
   Western intelligence sources estimate Khmer Rouge strength at
20,000 to 40,000 fighters, far more than the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front and forces led by Sihanouk.
   Hanoi has withdrawn about half its troops from Cambodia and says
50,000 remain. Western analysts put the number at about 70,000.
   The Khmer Rouge broadcast, in a statement attributed to its
leader Khieu Samphan, accused Hanoi of trying to avoid U.N.
supervision so it can keep soldiers in Cambodia secretly. It also
proposed the coalition of Hun Sen's government and the resistance
groups.
   Resistance leaders oppose Poland as a monitor because of its
ties to the Soviet Union, and India has recognized the Hun Sen
government.
   ``Without genuine supervision by the United Nations, there would
be no genuine withdrawal of Vietnamese troops,'' the Khmer Rouge
radio said.
   Vietnam and its client government in Phnom Penh oppose U.N.
supervision because Sihanouk's coalition has been given the
Cambodian seat in the General Assembly.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said in Paris that France was
willing to sponsor an international conference on Cambodia after
another round of talks by the Cambodian factions. Two meetings have
been held Jakarta, Indonesia, without substantial results.
   Sihanouk said Thursday the conference should include Vietnam,
the Cambodian factions, the six member nations of the non-communist
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council: the United States, Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France.

<HEAD>With AM-North Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush repeatedly refused on Friday to
talk about a written government admission that he took part in the
Reagan administration's secret Contra aid operation, saying he
wanted to avoid ``endangering the trial'' of Oliver North.
   Bush rebuffed reporters' questions, saying any comment from him
could prejudice the federal trial of North, the former White House
aide who is accused of lying and obstructing Congress about his
efforts to assist the Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``I am not going to comment on any aspect of the North trial
while it's in progress,'' Bush said at a White House
question-and-answer session. ``If I even comment on your question,
it could prejudice the trial.''
   He declared, ``The legal process ought to run unfettered without
you or me endangering the trial process. And that's the last
question I will take on that subject.''
   Bush deflected two later attempts to get his response to a
lengthy statement introduced at North's trial on Thursday. Parts of
the statement disclosed that Bush, while vice president, saw
several North memoranda involving the secret U.S. effort to aid the
Contras.
   The court summary of facts, introduced by North's attorneys and
agreed to by the government, also stated that Bush met in 1985 with
then-President Roberto Suazo of Honduras to tell him U.S. aid to
his country was being expedited.
   At the time, the administration was engaged in efforts to ensure
Honduras continued its key role in supporting the Contras while
Congress had forbidden U.S. aid to the rebels fighting the
government of Nicaragua.
   The expedited aid to Honduras was part of a secret agreement
calling for that nation, in return, to help the Contras, according
to the court summary.
   There was no indication that Bush mentioned this linkage when he
met with Suazo.
   Bush said Friday it would be imprudent for him to discuss the
matter. He also said, however that the material from the court
document has ``been available to the independent counsel and the
Iran-Contra committees and reviewed by them for any special
significance.''
   ``I've said all I want to say about it, because I really believe
on the advice of lawyers that that's the last thing we ought to do
is even be kicking it around,'' he said, his voice rising. ``So
please accept it when I said I don't want to talk about it any more
and I'm not going to.''
   Bush has denied knowing at the time about any diversion of Iran
arms-sales proceeds to the Contras, although he has acknowledged
knowing about the clandestine arms sales to Iran. He has said he
was not familiar with details of the Contra supply effort.
   In a speech just over a week after the Iran-Contra affair became
public at the end of 1986, Bush said he had supported the Iran arms
sales but, ``I was not aware of _ and oppose _ any diversion of
funds, any ransom payments or any circumvention of the will of the
Congress.''
   Meanwhile on Friday, House Speaker Jim Wright said Bush's role
in covert support for the Contras shouldn't damage evolving
bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy between Congress and the
White House.
   ``We're not going to permit anything that happened in the past
to interfere with what happens in the future,'' Wright, D-Texas,
told reporters following a speech in which he extolled
bipartisanship in U.S. policy toward Central America.
   ``That does not imply approval, or sanction'' of Bush's past
role as disclosed in the North trial statement, Wright said.
   The court document is preceded by a heading stating, ``The
United States has admitted for purposes of this trial the following
facts to be true.''
   It shows that Bush met with Suazo at a time when the Hondurans
had shown reluctance to continue helping the Contras.
   The Reagan administration, in part through special offers of
assistance, was trying to enlist Honduras and Nicaragua's three
other Central American neighbors to give the Contras weapons,
facilitate armament deliveries and allow use of their lands to be
used for such crucial Contra needs as aircraft landing zones.
   In early March 1985, Bush asked National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane whether Bush should ``encourage a private group to donate
a planeload of medical supplies that would arrive in Honduras
coincident with'' Bush's meeting with Suazo.
   ``Bush strongly favored such a flight,'' the document said,
``noting that the (unidentified) group was supportive of the
resistance.'' It said North told McFarlane that Bush's idea was
sound. The document did not reveal whether the planeload of
supplies actually arrived.

   The city will beef up police presence at
Saturday night's Grateful Dead concert because of violence this
week at concerts in Pittsburgh.
   Thirty-three officers will be at Riverfront Coliseum, along with
82 security officers and 60 ushers, said Dave Rager, the city's
assistant safety director.
   Some fans already were in town Thursday. Most of the 16,144
tickets sold went to out-of-towners, with almost 7,000 pre-sold to
``Dead Heads,'' as the group's ardent fans are called.
   ``Dead Heads'' often camp out at concerts and trade tapes and
souvenirs. City and Riverfront Coliseum officials planned to set up
a makeshift campground Friday night.
   Police in Pittsburgh arrested 55 people, mostly on public
intoxication and drug charges, at Grateful Dead concerts Sunday and
Monday. Pittsburgh police clashed Monday night with a crowd of more
than 500 who had surrounded the Civic Arena but did not have
concert tickets.
   The Grateful Dead band directed letters to ``Dead Heads'' to
inform them of Cincinnati's makeshift camping arrangement.
Riverfront Coliseum and the Cleveland-based Belkin Productions,
promoter for the Cincinnati concert, also printed fliers to inform
fans of the camping arrangements.

   A businessman charged in the Pentagon
corruption scandal acknowledged Friday that a private consultant
his firm had hired for $150,000 did nothing in return for the
initial installments on the contract.
   Dale Schnittjer, a former vice president of Teledyne Electronics
of Newbury Park, Calif., made the admission under cross-examination
in U.S. District Court as the defense wound up its case.
   Schnittjer and two other former Teledyne executives, George Kaub
and Eugene Sullivan, are charged with bribery, conspiracy and wire
fraud in the first trial stemming from the federal government's
``Ill Wind'' investigation, in which authorities are looking into
fraud and kickbacks at the Pentagon.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Williams dismissed the jury at
mid-day, instructing them to return Monday to hear closing
arguments before the deliberations begin. The trial began Monday.
   Schnittjer, the final defendant to take the stand, said he never
knew that William Parkin, a private consultant Teledyne Electronics
had hired in October 1985, had paid bribes to a Navy engineer for
confidential information about a $24 million contract for hand-held
radar equipment. Sullivan and Kaub also said they were kept in the
dark about Parkin's activities.
   Parkin and Stuart Berlin, the engineer, are among those who
pleaded guilty in the case before the trial began. They testified
for the government.
   Schnittjer, who joined Teledyne Electronics in the summer of
1987, around the time the company was awarded the radar contract,
said Parkin's deal with Teledyne called for him to receive $10,000
in up-front month.
   If Teledyne won the contract, the company agreed to sign a
sub-contract with Parkin for $150,000. ``We was supposed to work
for the sub-contract,'' Schnittjer said.
   Under questioning by Assistant U.S. attorney Jack Hanley,
however, Schnittjer acknowledged that Parkin did not produce any
work in exchange for the roughly $18,000 he received in early 1988.
   Schnittjer said, however, that Teledyne officials had discussed
having Parkin complete a report on avionics.
   Parkin's payments were stopped after the government's
investigation was made public in June 1988.
   Parkin's contract was terminated ``when we learned that Parkin
didn't appear to be what he was,'' Schnittjer said.
   In a related matter, Joseph E. Hill, 76, of Mineola, N.Y., was
sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and fined $20,000
for making illegal campaign contributions to congressional
campaigns. Hill, a private consultant, pleaded guilty to the four
misdemeanor counts earlier this year.
   He has admitted that he channeled corporate contributions to the
campaigns of unwitting congressional candidates as part of a scheme
organized by several former executives of Unisys Corp. Hill is one
of about a dozen people who have pleaded guilty in the Pentagon
investigation.

<HEAD>Parliament Lifts Seven-Year Ban on Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish
leader who banned Solidarity in 1981, voted with other parliament
members Friday to lift the legal barriers on the trade union.
   The parliament also voted to institute a strong presidency and
create the East bloc's first democratically elected parliament
chamber _ part of the economic and trade union reforms sealed
Wednesday following six weeks of talks between the Solidarity-led
opposition and communist authorities.
   Solidarity immediately announced it intended to back candidates
in the elections planned for June and called for ``broad social
activity'' to elect independent representatives.
   ``Historic, a turning point,'' said Jaruzelski, who likely will
become president, in referring to the changes enacted Friday. But
he also told state TV: ``There must be determined realization. Then
those words will be fully confirmed.''
   The Sejm, or parliament, lifted the last legal barriers to
Solidarity, meaning the union can go to court as early as next week
to register itself. It marks the end of the period of repression
that began with the Dec. 13, 1981, imposition of martial law.
   Sejm deputies passed six bills putting into law an agreement on
political, economic and trade union reforms sealed Wednesday
between the Solidarity-led opposition and communist authorities.
   The Sejm deferred action on another legislative motion in the
spirit of reform. Parliament member Ryszard Bender called for
changing the country's name from the ``The Polish People's
Republic'' to the simpler pre-World War II version, ``The Republic
of Poland.''
   Lawmakers, however, overwhelmingly enacted constitutional
changes creating a democratically chosen Senate and the post of
president.
   They also approved the trade union law that permits Solidarity
by a vote of 339-4 with 43 abstentions, the number of abstentions
reflecting lingering hesitancy of some party members to reinstate
the union.
   Also passed overwhelmingly were laws on elections to the Sejm;
elections to the new Senate; the right to form associations; and
legalizing farmers' unions, enabling the re-emergence of Rural
Solidarity. Rural Solidarity was banned along with Solidarity after
the 1981 crackdown.
   Jaruzelski, sitting in a section above most of the deputies,
raised his hand perfunctorily to vote ``yes.''
   There was little suspense in the proceedings since the Communist
Party has a strong grip on the Sejm and already had agreed to the
legislation.
   The only surprise was Bender's suggestion the country's name be
changed back to ``The Republic of Poland,'' dropping the adjective,
``People's.''
   ``The nation will not agree any longer with the strange-sounding
name of the state imposed during the period of Bierut-Stalinist
distortions,'' Bender said, referring to the now-discredited
Boleslaw Bierut, a loyal Stalinist who led Poland from 1947 until
his death in 1956.
   Bender later agreed to allow his motion to be referred to a
special commission considering a new constitution.
   Solidarity's statement on elections came at the end of a meeting
of the union's National Executive Commission that took place
without union leader Lech Walesa.
   ``It is a priority task to take advantage the new possibilities,
even though these elections will not yet be fully democratic,'' the
union said.
   It called on union members and the union's underground press to
cooperate in the election of independent candidates at all levels
and to work with other organizations like Rural Solidarity and the
Independent Students Association.
   It said that the advisory Citizen's Committee formed by Walesa
last year would take the main role in forming lists of independent
candidates, which would be fully backed by Solidarity and Walesa.
   Jaruzelski's vote to lift the ban on Solidarity concluded his
dramatic change of course in the past eight years. Although he
ordered Solidarity banned in 1981, Jaruzelski threatened to quit as
party leader in January if it did not restore the union.
   The general argued that legalization will culminate his policy
of national reconciliation and allow all those who feel responsible
for Poland's future to cooperate in rebuilding its shattered
economy.
   In the field of constitutional and electoral changes, the bills
define elections in June that will be the freest ever held in the
communist country.
   The 460 Sejm seats will be divided into two groups. For 299 of
the seats, or 65 percent, people will be able to vote for members
of the Communist Party and its allies, with the party itself taking
less than 50 percent and technically becoming a minority party.
   Thirty-five percent of the seats, or 161, will be reserved for
independent, non-party candidates.
   It was agreed the arrangement would be one-time only, and the
subsequent Sejm elections would be either totally or much more
democratic.
   The new fully democratic Senate will have 100 members. For the
first time, communist candidates must face direct competition from
anti-communist candidates.
   There will be no pre-screening of candidates to the Senate.
Anyone who collects 3,000 signatures can run for one of two seats
from each of the 49 provinces, with one extra seat apiece for the
cities of Warsaw and Katowice.
   The Senate will be able to veto legislation of the Sejm, and the
Sejm must muster a two-thirds majority to override the veto.
   The Sejm and Senate will form a National Assembly that will
select the president, a new post, who will have executive and veto
powers and can dissolve parliament during a constitutional crisis.
The job seems to be designed for Jaruzelski, as a guarantee Poland
will stay in the communist bloc.

<HEAD>Environmental Groups Urge Bush To Drop Cason Nomination</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of conservation groups Friday
urged President Bush to withdraw his nomination of James Cason to
oversee the Forest Service, saying Cason has shown a ``wanton
insensitivity'' toward the environment.
   The groups said that Cason, as an acting assistant secretary at
the Interior Department, had ``improperly'' applied pressure on the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to keep the spotted owl off the
endangered species list and ordered the destruction of a Bureau of
Land Management draft report that said the owl was threatened by
logging in the ancient forests of the Northwest.
   The groups also said that Cason:
   _Auuthorized the publication of the so-called ``mining in the
parks'' rule, which would have weakend existing regulations
covering strip mining in national parks and wilderness areas.
   _Attempted to stop the Forest Service from carrying out a
congressional mandate to publish regulations governing oil and gas
leases in national forests.
   _Was responsible for mismanaging an Office of Surface Mining
permit system that resulted in the waste of millions of taxpayer
dollars.
   Bush has nominated Cason as an assistant secretary of
agriculture with authority over the Forest Service and the Soil and
Conservation Service. The nomination needs Senate approval for
Cason to take office.
   In a letter to Bush, the environmental groups said that because
of Cason's ``lack of appreciation for the stewardship
responsibilities entrusted to public officials who preside over
public lands and resources, and his wanton insensitivity to the
environmental values which he has been obligated to protect, he is
unsuited for the post of assistant secretary.''
   The letter said Cason has a ``proven record of antagonism''
toward the environment'' and an ``extreme bias in favor of those
who financially benefit from the exploitation of the nation's
public lands and resources ...'''
   Among those signing the letter were the National Wildlife
Federation, The Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the National
Parks and Conservation Association, the Izzak Walton League, the
National Audubon Society, Defenders of Wildlife and the Mineral
Policy Center.
   Cason, through an Agriculture Department spokeswoman, has
``categorically'' denied that he exerted pressure on the Fish and
Wildlife Service not to list the spotted owl as endangered. He has
also declined interviews until after his confirmation hearing
before the Senate Agriculture Committee.

<TEXT>
   Officials overwhelmed by the numbers of
people picked up drunk each year in this city bordering the
nation's largest Indian tribe urged Congress to choose Gallup for a
pilot program to fight alcohol abuse.
   Mayor Edward Munoz told a field hearing of the House Committee
on Interior and Insular Affairs that alcoholism is such an
overwhelming problem that it's beyond the resources of the local
community. Officials are hoping to get money to be able to treat
alcoholics, rather than just have them put in a police department
drunk tank.
   Munoz, who was re-elected last week following a campaign that
focused in part on the alcoholism problem, called for cooperation
between the city, state and federal governments and the Navajo and
Zuni tribes.
   In the past, he said, efforts by Gallup to interest other
governments in the fighting the problem has been met by
``occasional rhetoric ... but seldom action.''
   The city of 22,000 people is a major trade center for the
adjacent Navajo Nation, and its population swells to double or even
triple daily. Since alcohol is prohibited on the reservations, any
drinking is done in Gallup.
   The Navajo Nation, with 200,000 members, is the largest Indian
tribe in the nation. About 165,000 of its members live on the
125,000-square-mile reservation that spans portions of Utah,
Arizona and New Mexico. The smaller Zuni Pueblo, also near Gallup,
has a tribal membership of about 9,000.
   City figures show 26,222 incidents of protective custody _ where
drunks are put in a drunk tank by police while they sober up _ in
1988 and more than 30,000 in 1987. A consultant estimated the 1987
figure represented 5,000 to 7,000 people, each picked up an average
of four or more times.
   Officials did not have a breakdown on how many of those taken
into protective custody are Indians, but said it was a significant
fraction. The city wants to replace protective custody with a
detoxification and treatment center.
   Munoz told the hearing the city could commit $2.5 million in
bonds toward building a center and some city money toward its
operation, but would need state and federal assistance to handle
the estimated $4.2 million annual cost of running the center.
   ``The history of this issue is one of finger-pointing and
buck-passing,'' the mayor said. He urged the congressmen at the
hearing to move quickly.
   Gallup Police Chief Frank Gonzales agreed that protective
custody has become a revolving door and said detoxification was the
only way to break the cycle. But beyond treatment, he said, the
city has to have jobs and continued care for recovering alcoholics.
   ``As long as we keep protective custody, we're not going to
solve the problem,'' he said. ``We're going to keep losing lives.
Families are going to keep breaking up.''
   The hearing marks the second time in recent weeks that Congress
has turned its attention to alcoholism in Gallup. Last month, New
Mexico's senators, Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman, held an
informal fact-finding meeting in the community.
   Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, chairman of Friday's
hearing, said the New Mexico congressional delegation would be
acting together in working on the issue.

   The campaign to recover oil from the
ruptured Exxon Valdez along the Alaskan coast likely will be the
costliest ever, an industry expert said Friday.
   From air-dropped dispersants to the crew members painstakingly
raking up debris along the shoreline, cleanup operations are
invariably costly and this one will involve thousands of people and
many months, said Richard Golob, publisher of Golob's Oil Pollution
Bulletin.
   Cleanup costs vary depending on the degree of difficulty, but
Golob said the Arco Anchorage grounding in 1985 off the Washington
coast cost $9 million to clean up and the Exxon Valdez incident
spilled about 40 times more oil than that accident. He said the
Amoco Cadiz spill off France in 1978 cost $110 million to clean.
   The average recovery effort costs from $12 to $25 a gallon,
Golob said, but he said the cost of removing the 10.1 million
gallons from Alaska's Prince William Sound will soar particularly
high because it involves a partially water that is inaccessible
from land.
   So far the crude oil has floated over an estimated 3,000 square
miles, killing birds and sea otters, and it threatens a national
park.
   Initial efforts to use dispersant chemicals to break up the
slick and mechanical sweepers to recover floating oil were
expensive, and ineffective. Now, Golob said, the focus has shifted
to an even costlier labor-intensive, long-term effort to clean up
the rugged coastal area.
   ``Workers participating in the shoreline operation will have to
be transported each day long distances and much of the work will
most likely have to be staged from boats anchored off the
shoreline,'' Golob said.
   Golob said the cost also was likely to be high because local and
state officials in Alaska will push for a thorough job.
   ``A key question in any cleanup is `How clean is clean?''' he
said.
   ``In an industrial harbor, it's going to be at a lower level
than in a pristine area such as Prince William Sound,'' Golob said.
``The government and public in that region will push for a return
the area to its once-pristine condition.''
   The spill also will bring expenses beyond those of the
chemicals, equipment and labor, he said.
   ``It's still difficult to assess the total amount of damage in
terms of economic resources such as commercial fisheries and
natural resources such as sea otters and water fowl, '' he said.
``But there's no doubt it will be long-term and extensive.''
   He said Exxon also should be prepared for court-award damages.
   He noted a federal judge's $115.2 million recommendation in
February against Amoco Corp. for the damage from the 1978 Amoco
Cadiz supertanker wreck off the coast of France.
   ``It's very difficult to ... put a dollar value on the loss of a
bird,'' he said. ``But damage suits have already been filed on
behalf of the fishermen who stand to lose a lot.''

   A man hijacked a Greyhound bus bound from Montreal
to New York on Friday and it was driven to the Canadian Parliament,
where he threatened to blow it up, authorities said.
   Sharpshooters from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police surrounded
the bus, which was parked on the lawn in front of the House of
Commons, witnesses said.
   Witnesses reported hearing gunshots from the area near the bus,
but it was not known if there were any injuries to the eight to 11
people believed on board.
   One unidentified hostage left the bus with a note saying the man
had dynamite and wanted to talk to the media.
   One witness, House of Commons employee Andre Parent, said a man
had overpowered the driver of the bus and fired two shots.
   The bus apparently tried to pull away by driving across the lawn
in front of the main building of the House of Commons building, but
it appeared to get stuck in the grass.
   An RCMP officer was seen approaching the bus with his hands in
the air, and shots were fired.
   A Montreal radio station reported that the bus had been hijacked
in Montreal, and Vermont police said the bus, carrying eight to 11
passengers, was taken over as it was leaving Montreal for New York.
   Police apparently turned down the man's request to talk to
reporters.
   Traffic was sealed off for blocks around the Parliament complex.
Dozens of police and a crowd of spectators gathered against the
stone and wrought-iron fence that lines Parliament Hill. People
were evacuated from offices near the scene.

<HEAD>EDS: Subs 13th graf bgng: He did ... to add quote from account of

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright asked a former aide
to ``help him out'' by signing a sworn statement that the aide
volunteered to work on Wright's book and had done so after working
hours, according to testimony to the ethics committee studying the
speaker's finances.
   The aide's account, disputed Friday by a Wright spokesman, is
the latest revelation to emerge from the probe of alleged
improprieties by Wright that has tarnished his reputation and
threatened his leadership of the chamber.
   Sources familiar with the deposition of the former aide, Matthew
Cossolotto, said he told the committee that Wright also asked
aides, at a morning staff meeting early in 1985, to help think of
ways to sell the book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   Mark Johnson, Wright's spokesman, dismissed Cossolotto's account
as that of ``a disgruntled former employee.''
   The committee, which began investigating Wright last June, has
narrowed its focus to charges that Wright used bulk sales of the
book to circumvent House limits on outside income from speaking and
writing fees, and charges that he improperly accepted ``gifts''
from a Fort Worth business partner who had an interest in
legislation before Congress, according to sources familiar with the
probe.
   The committee wrapped up its second week of deliberations Friday
and expected to reach some conclusions in the case next week. But
there were indications the panel's work might be far from over.
   Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the panel was seeking to
extend the contract of its special outside investigator, Chicago
attorney Richard Phelan, to July 1. That would allow the panel,
should it decide to seek disciplinary action against Wright, to
retain its counsel during the period the rules allow for defense
motions and committee action on them.
   But both Dixon and the panel's senior Republican, Rep. John T.
Myers of Indiana, cautioned reporters ``don't read anything into''
the extension of the contract.
   The two senior panel members also strongly suggested for the
first time that the panel will publicly release Phelan's full
456-page report regardless of the outcome of the case. Dixon said
committee precedent is for such reports by outside counsel to be
released in their entirety.
   ``The committee is bound by some precedent,'' Dixon said. ``The
precedent, as I see it, is that when we've hired outside counsel
all material related to the specific respondent has been released.''
   That position put Dixon at odds with that of members of the
House Democratic leadership, who have argued the panel should
release only those parts of the report which support its
conclusions.
   In his deposition to the ethics panel last year, Cossolotto said
he had telephoned Wright last June on the day that a Washington
Post story detailed his role in compiling and editing the book,
including a three-week trip to Fort Worth to oversee its
preparation for printing.
   He did not at first reach the speaker, but Wright later called
him back, he told the panel. The speaker wanted him to ``say some
things that would help him out'' and suggested that Cossolotto
draft a statement saying he had volunteered to work on the book
after regular office hours, he told the committee. Cossolotto said
he declined to make such a statement because he believed the book
assignment to be part of his official duties.
   House rules state that taxpayers' money may not be used to pay
lawmakers' employees to do nonofficial or personal tasks, but the
definition of what constitutes such tasks is left vague. Sources
have said the ethics panel is not focusing on that issue but rather
the bulk sales of the book and Wright's other business dealings.
   Cossolotto also said Wright had directed staff members to find
ways to sell the book. Soon after that directive, staff members
arranged book signings, a distribution of copies _ paid for by
lobbyists _ to Democrats attending a party conference and an
appearance on a televised talk show.
   One ethics committee member, who did not wish to be identified,
acknowledged Thursday that the issue of book promotion was before
the panel, but it was unclear how serious the committee considers
that issue.
   Johnson, Wright's spokesman, said ``we flatly deny the
allegation by Mr. Cossolotto that the speaker had directed the
staff to systematically sell the books.''
   Wright himself conceded on Wednesday that in at least one
instance _ the 1984 bulk sale of 504 copies to Southwest Texas
State University _ he had given his assent to selling the books in
lieu of a $3,000 speaking fee which he was ineligible to accept
because he already was near the outside income limit for the year.
   In at least one other case, the March 1986 sale of $1,000 worth
of books in lieu of a speaking fee from Mid-Continent Oil and Gas
Association, the suggestion to buy books also came from a Wright
staff aide, according to a source familiar with the transaction.
Wright was to ship the books not to the trade group, but to schools
in Texas, the source said.
   Johnson also disputed Cossolotto's account to the ethics
committee of the request for an affidavit, saying the former aide
had initiated the conversation and volunteered to make such a
statement, then later backed out.
   Cossolotto and his attorney, James Hamilton, declined to comment
on the deposition.

   Former Vice President Spiro Agnew
cannot take a deduction on his California income tax returns for
repaying Maryland for bribes he alleged accepted, a state tax
appeals board has ruled.
   Agnew, for the past decade a resident of the affluent Palm
Springs suburb of Rancho Mirage, has already paid the disputed
state taxes, but filed an appeal seeking a $24,197 refund based on
disapproved deductions for $268,462 in court-ordered restitution,
fines and interest.
   The California Franchise Tax Board denied those deductions from
Agnew's 1982 state income tax return in a 1986 audit. Agnew's
appeal of that decision was denied Thursday on a unanimous 5-0 vote
of the state Board of Equalization.
   ``If we allow this deduction and give Mr. Agnew the refund, we
are in effect asking other California taxpayers to subsidize Mr.
Agnew's wrongdoing,'' said board member Conway Collis.
   Agnew still may appeal for a re-hearing or challenge the board's
decision in court.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore alleged that Agnew
received $147,500 in illegal cash kickbacks from Maryland highway
contractors for awarding them road contracts beginning in 1963 when
he was Baltimore County executive and continuing while he was
governor and vice president.
   On Oct. 10, 1973, Agnew pleaded no contest to a single count of
evading federal income taxes on the kickbacks. The plea bargain, in
which Agnew did not admit taking bribes, netted him a three-year
suspended prison term and a $10,000 fine. He also resigned as vice
president.
   Agnew was ordered to pay back taxes, penalties and interest in
1974 on the alleged illicit income: $148,000 to the federal
government and $14,105 to Maryland.
   Seven years later, as a result of a civil suit, Agnew made
restitution to the state of Maryland for the alleged bribes, which
with interest totaled $268,482.
   He contended that amounted to giving back income on which he had
already paid taxes. By then a California resident, he deducted the
entire amount plus $11,322 in legal fees from his 1982 California
tax return, which showed more than $600,000 in income.

<TEXT>
   President Najib's government on Friday
denounced U.S. plans to name a special diplomatic representative to
the Afghan guerrillas.
   Pakistan, meanwhile, said the Afghan government blasted
Pakistani territory with a Soviet-made Scud missile early Friday.
No casualties were reported.
   There was no confirmation by Afghan authorities.
   The Afghan officials, however, reported more fighting in the
eastern city of Jalalabad, acknowledging their unilateral
cease-fire had failed hours after it was declared.
   The Afghan Foreign Ministry said the U.S. decision to send an
envoy for the guerrillas ``is not only an intervention in the
internal affairs of Afghanistan, but it is also a provocative
action that is assisting the extremists.''
   Sources in Washington said the Bush administration is
designating Peter Tomsen, the No. 2 diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing, as a special envoy to the Pakistan-based guerrillas.
   The Moslem guerrillas have been trying for the last decade to
oust the Soviet-style party that took power by coup and
assassination in 1978.
   On Feb. 23, the guerrillas selected an interim government they
hope will replace Najib's government.
   Government spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani, reading the
denunciation to reporters, accused the United States of violating a
1988 accord that paved the way for Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan and ended nine years of Moscow's combat support for
Kabul.
   Under the U.N.-sponsored accord, Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed
not to intervene in each other's internal affairs. The United
States and the Soviet Union signed the accord as guarantors.
   By designating a special envoy to the guerrillas, the United
States ``has tried to give an impetus to the fading, declining
existence of the so-called interim government,'' Amani said.
   ``It would be better for the United States, if the United States
is truly, faithfully demanding peace, to pressure Pakistan to stop
intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan,'' he said.
   Kabul has accused Pakistan of massing as many as 8,000 of its
soldiers and militiamen to participate in the Afghan civil war.
   The government spokesman acknowledged that Kabul was still
receiving Soviet weapons but said this should not be compared to
U.S. support for the guerrillas.
   ``Afghanistan is a country that is recognized by 84 countries of
the world, Amani said. ``Only three reactionary countries have
recognized this so-called interim government _ Saudi Arabia, Sudan
and Bahrain.''
   All three are Moslem nations, and Saudi Arabia has been a major
backer of the guerrillas, along with the United States, Pakistan
and China.
   The United States and Afghanistan have diplomatic relations, but
the United States closed its embassy and evacuated remaining
diplomats before the Soviet withdrawal was completed Feb. 15,
saying it feared security would deteriorate once the Red Army was
gone.
   Kabul has remained relatively calm since the Soviet pullout,
although at least 12 people were killed by guerrilla rockets this
week.
   Instead, the guerrillas have focused on Jalalabad, 75 miles east
of Kabul and 40 miles from the Pakistan border.
   The guerrillas launched an offensive on Jalalabad on March 6 but
so far have failed to capture it. Jalalabad would give the
guerrillas an Afghan base for their interim government.
   Amani said guerrillas and government soldiers exchanged rocket
fire at Jalalabad in the last 24 hours. He said 148 opposition
fighters, nine civilians and one Afghan government soldier were
killed.
   In Pakistan, the guerrillas' Afghan News Agency said that 80
Afghan soldiers were killed in fighting around the city in the past
three days.
   The reports could not be confirmed, since Jalalabad is
off-limits to foreign reporters and other independent observers.
   Amani said guerrilla fire killed three women and five children
in Khost in Paktia province, and government fire killed 15
opposition fighters in Kandahar province.

<HEAD>Movie Rating Board Sticks to X-Rating for `Scandal' Flick</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's movie rating board has stuck to
the X rating slapped on ``Scandal,'' about the 1960s Profumo affair
that toppled a British government, despite appeals from the
moviemaker.
   The Motion Picture Association of America's appeals board voted
Thursday in New York to sustain the X rating, an action viewed as
box office poison because few theaters show such films and
advertisements are difficult to place.
   ``Scandal'' distributor Miramax Films recruited First Amendment
attorney Martin Garbus to state its case.
   Garbus conceded ``Scandal'' was a sexy film, but argued that if
British audiences could see it so should American moviegoers.
   The appeals board voted 8-7 to retain the X rating. A two-thirds
vote of the appeals board is required to overturn an MPAA rating.
   Miramax lawyer Dan Zinkin said the close vote was unusual,
noting the board is usually unanimous. He suspected the highly
erotic content in an orgy scene guided those voting for X.
   The MPAA doesn't disclose reasons for its rating decisions.
   Miramax must now decide whether to keep the X rating, reject it
and go out unrated, or cut the offending orgy scene and resubmit it
to the MPAA.
   Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of the film company, said only
that Miramax was ``currently examining legal options and consulting
with their attorneys.''
   ``Scandal'' recreates the torrid Profumo affair that brought
down the conservative government of Harold Macmillan in 1963.
   The movie, based on the Phillip Knightley and Carolyn Kennedy
book called ``An Affair of State: The Profumo Case and the Framing
of Stephen Ward,'' features philandering politicians, call girls,
Soviet spies and the sex party.
   The story surrounds the liaisons between call girl Christine
Keeler, war minister John Profumo and Soviet operative Eugene
Ivanov.
   British critics loved the movie, but politicians condemned it
for raking up memories of the affair that forced a minister to
resign, caused Ivanov's recall and led to the suicide of Ward, a
prominent osteopath.
   The movie stars Joanne Whalley-Kilmer as Ms. Keeler, John Hurt
as Ward, Ian McKellen as Profumo and Britt Ekland as Mariella
Novotny, a brothel keeper.
   Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the opposition Labor Party,
said the movie ``seems to be a disgrace to our society.'' But
London's Daily Mail praised the picture.
   ``This account of the Profumo affair is the most accomplished
British commercial film in a long time _ fluent, engrossing, racing
along the story capsuled long ago in that headline ``The Minister,
The Model and The Russian Spy,''' the Daily Mail said.

<HEAD>Spokeswoman Says Maine Senator Will File Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, will file a
report required by federal law stating that the East German
government paid for one night's lodging at a conference he attended
in June 1987, his spokeswoman said Friday.
   Cohen was one of at least a handful of members of the House and
Senate who neglected to report travel expenses picked up by foreign
governments as required under the 1978 Foreign Gifts and
Decorations Act, The Associated Press reported this week.
   Several lawmakers said they were unaware of the law or confused
about its requirements. It calls for any gifts or travel expenses
paid by foreign governments to be reported on a form. Senators must
report gifts over $100; House members have a ceiling of $180.
   Cohen's spokeswoman, Kathy Gest, said information just received
from the American Embassy in East Germany indicated the cost of the
hotel was $132.40, $32.40 over the $100 filing limit. As a result,
she said, Cohen would file under the foreign gifts act.
   ``It would be naive to think that anyone would intentionally
violate the law for that amount of money,'' she said. ``We were
originally under the impression that no form was required.''
   She said the incident raises questions about some of the
provisions of the law and its clarity.
   Cohen was invited to the conference by the Institute for
East-West Security Studies, a non-profit group in New York that did
not specify the East Germans would pay for the lodging.
   Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., another conference participant,
estimated three nights in Potsdam cost $400.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., has also filed a form, indicating that
the governments of New Zealand and Australia paid for ground
transportation on a trip to those places in January 1987, said Mark
Bowen, his spokesman.
   Others on the trips who did not file were Sens. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, Larry Pressler, R-S.D., and then-Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont.
   Failure to file within 30 days carries a penalty, on conviction,
of $5,000, plus the cost of the expenses.
   But officials of the Senate and House ethics committees say they
do not know of anyone being charged for failing to report travel
expenses.

<HEAD>Democrats Budge a Bit on Minimum Wage; Bush Says He Won't</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats on Friday reduced the size of
the increase they are asking in the minimum wage but not enough for
President Bush who vowed again to veto any raise of more than 90
cents over three years.
   In the second day of debate on the measure, Democrats cut by a
dime to $4.55 the minimum wage they want in effect by October 1991
_ compared with the current $3.35 _ and agreed for the first time
to a 60-day subminimum for workers who are new on the job.
   Bush, however, declared he had ``no intention of budging one
inch'' on allowing a minimum wage that high or on accepting that
short a period during which employers could pay a ``training wage''
20 percent below the federal floor.
   ``I will veto any bill which exceeds a $4.25 wage level and
which does not contain a six-month training wage for new hires,''
he said in a letter Friday to Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole.
   Two showdown votes were scheduled for next Tuesday _ the first
on the latest compromise between Northern and Southern Democrats
and the second on what Bush said again is his only offer.
   ``We fired our best shot and last shot and only shot first,''
Bush told reporters at the White House. ``I have no inention of
budging one inch on this. I have too much at stake.''
   The leading proponent of the wage increase, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., appeared confident he had the 51 votes to pass
what essentially is the same bill approved by the House last month.
But he acknowledged he lacked the two-thirds majority required to
override a veto.
   ``They've come a long way,'' he said of the administration.
``We've come a long way. I would hope they don't again lay down
this line in the sand.''
   However, Dole said many Republicans believe Bush already ``has
gone too far'' on allowing an increase.
   The latest Democratic plan was put together by Kennedy and Sens.
Bob Graham of Florida and David Pryor of Arkansas.
   Like the House-passed bill, it would provide annual 40 cent
hourly increases, to $3.85 an hour on Oct. 1, to $4.25 on Oct. 1,
1990, and to $4.55 a year later. The orginal version called for a
50 cent increase this year.
   Bush's version calls for annual 30 cent increases, beginning
next January to $3.65 and then up to $3.95 in 1991 and $4.25 in
1992. The minimum wage has been frozen at $3.35 since 1981.
   The House and new Senate Democratic measures differ only in the
way they treat the 60-day training wage. Only if it is a worker's
first job could an employer pay the lower wage in the House
version. Under the Senate measure, a new worker would have to have
at least 60 days of experience in one or more jobs before his
employer would have to pay the higher scale.
   Bush's subminimum would allow employers to continue paying $3.35
to any new hire, regardless of their previousexperience, for six
months. That subminimum would rise to $3.40 an hour in 1992 under
the president's proposal.

   Thousands of Palestinians rioted and stoned
police Friday outside Al Aqsa Mosque after midday prayers on the
first day of Ramadan, the Moslem holy month.
   Police responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. At least five
policemen, three Palestinians and several journalists were hurt.
   The hour-long battle on Temple Mount _ known to Moslems as Haram
al Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary _ was the worst violence in a year at
the third holiest site of Islam. Clouds of tear gas rose from the
hilltop in Jerusalem's Old City dominated by the Al Aqsa and Dome
of the Rock mosques.
   A leaflet distributed by the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas (Zeal)
movement urged Palestinians to welcome Ramadan by escalating their
16-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   At least 37 Palestinians were arrested. Police commander Yosef
Yehudai said most were from the West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem.
   A similar protest occurred at Hebron in the West Bank. Hundreds
of worshipers chanting nationalist slogans stoned soldiers, who
opened fire, wounding four Palestinians. The army put the city
under curfew.
   Jewish settlers in Hebron hurled stones at Arab-owned vehicles,
retaliating for similar Arab attacks, Israel radio said.
   In Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot and wounded two Palestinian
teen-agers during a riot, Arab hospital officials said.
   The violence came one day after President Bush supported Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for residents of the occupied
lands to elect representatives to negotiate with Israel.
   Influential Palestinians greeted the idea coolly and said it
must be part of a broader program, including promises to end the
occupation and trade land for peace. Israel captured the West Bank
and Gaza from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the daily Al Fajr, said the uprising,
in which 420 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been slain, would
continue ``until Shamir comes up with a better proposal.''
   His paper supports the Palestine Liberation Organization, with
which Israel refuses to deal.
   While Siniora and other moderates expressed skepticism about
Shamir's motivation, they left the door open to further
discussions. Palestinian hard-liners ruled out elections.
   Shamir said on Israel radio Friday there ``appears to be a full
understanding'' between him and Bush. He made little of their
differences, including Bush's call for an end to Israeli occupation.
   Rioting began in Jerusalem after about 25,000 worshipers
attended noon prayers on the first day of Ramadan, the Moslem month
of daytime fasting and religious fervor.
   Israeli officials have expressed fear of an escalation of the
uprising during Ramadan, which marks the month the prophet Mohammed
began receiving the holy Koran from Allah.
   Al Aqsa is an important national symbol to Palestinians and the
Dome of the Rock marks the spot from which, in Islamic belief,
Mohammed ascended to heaven on his horse.
   The 35-acre rectangular platform on which the mosque coplex is
built also is the site of the ancient Jewish Temple, the holiest
shrine of Judaism, which the Romans destroyed in the year 70.
   About 4,000 worshipers stayed behind in the mosque complex after
prayers Friday, police said.
   They chanted ``Allahu Akbar!'' _ ``God is great!'' _ and
``Palestine is Moslem!'' They also waved five larged Palestinian
flags and burned two Israeli flags. Palestinian flags are illegal
in Israel.
   At first, only a few Palestinians threw stones at the hundreds
of police arrayed outside the courtyard walls. Then a policeman
fired a shot into the air.
   ``This shot led to the great confusion,'' said Moshe Nussbaum,
an Israel radio reporter. ``Seconds after the shot was fired, we
were barraged by stones.''
   Rocks pelted dozens of journalists who had observed the prayers
from an adjacent rooftop.
   Wolfgang Scheider, a cameraman for Austrian TV, was struck in
the head and collapsed, blood streaming down his face.
   Police fired rubber bullets and hundreds of tear gas canisters
over the wall, then entered to arrest demonstrators.
   At the Wailing Wall, which lines one side of the complex, the
ground was littered with stones. The area was devoid of the Jewish
worshipers who normally crowd the site.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said: ``If they continue to exploit
the Temple Mount's sanctity for riots and harm worship at the
Western (Wailing) Wall, Israel will know how to deal with them.''
   Police said they would increase security and keep some
Palestinians away from mosques.

   Syrian gunners fired 11 howitzer shells
into Lebanon's Christian-held regions Friday, violating a fragile
cease-fire. Police said no casualties were reported.
   A police spokesman said eight Soviet-designed 130mm shells
slammed into sandy beaches near the Christian port of Jounieh north
of Beirut early Friday.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with standing
rules, said three other Syrian-fired shells exploded near the
Christian suburb of Hadeth on Beirut's southeastern edge Friday
afternoon.
   Police put the casualty toll at 177 people killed and 591
wounded in the monthlong confrontation between Gen. Michel Aoun's
20,000 Christian troops and an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces.
   The confrontation exacerbated a political crisis that created
competing Christian and Moslem governments and split the army on
sectarian lines.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon and has become the country's
main power broker during the long civil war. Aoun has declared a
``war of liberation'' against the Syrians.
   The truce was called Wednesday by Kuwait's foreign minister,
Sheik Sabah Ahmed Sabah, who heads an Arab League committee on
Lebanon.
   Despite the limited cease-fire violations, most residents around
Beirut remained huddled in basements and underground shelters to
avoid a sudden outbreak of hostilities.
   ``One can't predict what might happen,'' said Adel Bohsali, a
spare parts dealer in Moslem west Beirut. ``I'm keeping my wife and
two sons in the basement _ or close to it.''
   Syrian and Christian gunners briefly broke the truce at midday
Thursday with a mortar and rocket duel that wounded 15 people.
   Aoun has formally rejected the truce, but a spokesman for Aoun
said the general would ``not respond to the Syrian provocative fire
if it remains within bearable limits.'' The spokesman, who cannot
be named under standing procedure, would not define those limits.
   Aoun has urged all Lebanese factions to meet to settle to the
14-year-old civil war.
   Nabih Berri, who heads the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal
militia, rejected Aoun's offer and urged the Syrians to maintain
their troops in Lebanon.
   Lebanon's latest political crisis began Sept. 22, when
Parliament could not agree on a successor to President Amin Gemayel
at the end of his six-year term and Gemayel named Aoun to head an
interim government.
   Moslems rejected the appointment and swore allegiance to Salim
Hoss, the Sunni Moslem premier who led the government during
Gemayel's administration.
   Under an unwritten national covenant dating to independence from
France in 1943, Lebanon's president is a Christian, the premier a
Sunni and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   The confrontation broke out March 8, after Aoun ordered a
blockade of the private ports with which Moslem militias finance
their operations.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's militia rejected the decision and
started shelling the Christian-held regions. Syrian troops later
joined in.

<HEAD>Swiss Watchmaking Birthplace Holds Sale Expected To Raise Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This birthplace of Swiss watchmaking on Sunday
will be the site of an auction of 301 timepieces that organizers
expect will bring in millions of dollars.
   A team of watchmakers took nine years to design and assemble the
1,278 parts of the top item, said auctioneer Osvaldo Patrizzi.
   The exposition, ``Calibre 89,'' has been viewed by nearly 10,000
potential buyers and watch fans on a pre-sale world tour with stops
in Europe, the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
   Made by Patek Philippe, the Geneva watchmaking company to mark
its 150th anniversary, the 18-carat, 3.4-inch-diameter gold case
packs 68 springs, 126 jewels and 332 screws.
   The parts include a wheel that turns once in a century and a
lever that moves every four years to make sure that the watch's
calendar skips a leap year date.
   It is the first watch in the world that determines the date of
Easter, which varies, and also features a disc of sapphire crystal
showing the Milky Way and 2,800 stars in five sizes according to
their order of magnitude.
   Patrizzi, watch expert of the Habsburg, Feldman auctioneers
organizing the sale, said he was sure buyer interest would push the
price to between $3 and $6 million. To date, the highest price paid
for an auctioned timepiece was $1.2 million in 1984 for a mid-17th
century clock.
   Patek Philippe's ``Packard'' watch, one of the world's first
major complicated timepieces, was bought by American automobile
tycoon James Ward Packard in 1927 for $3,100. It was bought back by
the company for its own collection 61 years later for more than
$1.2 million.
   The sale of ``Calibre 89'' winds up the auction held before an
expected capacity audience of 700 in the ballroom of one of
Geneva's plushest hotels, the lakeside century-old Hotel de
Bergues. Hundreds of others can follow the sale in three other
rooms by closed-circuit television.
   The 300 other watches are also all by Patek Philippe. Several
are more than 100 years old and 34 are expected to fetch between
$60,000 and $600,000. All are pictured with detailed pedigree in a
catalogue in English and Japanese which sells for $60.

<HEAD>American Museum Rejects Indian Claim on Sacred Bundle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Museum of Natural History announced
Friday it would not give a 150-year-old Indian relic to a Cree
Indian who ran across the country to retrieve it, saying he wanted
the sacred object for his people.
   Spokesman Herbert Kurz said the museum sent Jim Thunder an
express mail letter to his home in Edmonton, Canada, on Thursday
notifying him of the decision.
   ``I had been anticipating this,'' Thunder said. He would not say
if he would continue his effort to retrieve the artifact and said
he had no further comment.
   On Sept. 1 in Edmonton, the 38-year-old American Indian began a
2,700-mile run across Canada to draw attention to his mission. He
arrived March 21 in New York and formally made his request to
museum officials the next day.
   Thunder claimed to be a great-great grandson of Chief Big Bear,
the Cree leader who created the artifact _ a sacred calico-wrapped
bundle holding bear claws, sweet grass and a plug of tobacco _ to
give his people spiritual strength and guidance.
   Ten years ago, Thunder said, Big Bear spoke to him in dreams and
visions and instructed him to bring the sacred bundle back to his
tribe in Western Canada where it would be used in prayers and
sacred Indian ceremonies.
   In 1934, a son of Big Bear gave the bundle to a museum
anthropologist.
   Since that time it has been stored as part of a special research
collection. While it is available for study by scholars and
Indians, it has never been put on display.
   Stanley A. Freed, a museum curator who met with Thunder, told
him in the letter that several factors, including claims for the
bundle by other Cree, went into the museum's decision.
   ``The museum has received communications from other Cree ...
asking that the medicine bundle not be given to Mr. Thunder and
raising questions about his relationship to Big Bear,'' Kurz said.
   Other Indians and tribal groups have told the museum that the
bundle should be given to them, rather than to Thunder.
   Thunder admits he has no ``blood relationship'' with Big Bear,
but said he was adopted in 1985 by a great-granddaughter of the
leader.
   Big Bear made the bundle more than 150 years ago when he was
about 13 years old, and later wore it into battle for protection
and guidance.
   A son of Big Bear _ Joe Pimi, who was also known as Horse Child
_ sought out the museum anthropologist who was leading an
expedition into central Canada and presented it to the museum for
safe-keeping, the museum said.
   ``It is our responsibility to honor (Pimi's) wish,'' Freed wrote
to Thunder.

   Former President Reagan and top officials of
his administration were more deeply involved than previously
disclosed in efforts to encourage other countries to aid
Nicaragua's Contra rebels, new trial evidence shows.
   A statement of facts introduced in Oliver L. North's trial on
Thursday _ in a document agreed to by the government _ indicated
Reagan, former Secretary of State George Shultz and former
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger played key roles in
providing inducements for such aid.
   The three-member Tower Commission, appointed by Reagan to
investigate the Iran-Contra affair, said in its Feb. 26, 1987,
report that it had found ``no evidence to suggest that the
president was aware'' of North's activities in the 1984-86 period
on behalf of the rebels opposing the Nicaraguan government.
   Direct government assistance by the United States was prohibited
by law at the time.
   The statement of facts says that in mid-August 1984, one of
North's superiors, then-Deputy National Security Adviser John
Poindexter, discussed with Reagan and others a proposal ascribed to
Shultz that would allow Congress to ``wink'' at lethal support for
the resistance.
   Under the plan, the document says, the United States ``would
provide military aid to El Salvador, which in turn would provide
lethal aid to the resistance.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who was a
member of the Senate's Iran-Contra committee, said Thursday that
such an arrangement would be ``clearly inappropriate, possibly
illegal.''
   Shultz testified at the Iran-Contra hearings that in seeking aid
for the Contras, ``it seemed to me not a particularly good idea to
go to countries with which we had a big military or economic
assistance relationship because it could easily be misinterpreted.''
   The new document says that on Feb. 19, 1985, National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane sent a memorandum to Reagan about a
recommendation to provide incentives to Honduras to aid the Contras.
   ``The memorandum described each of the agreed-upon incentives,''
according to the statement of facts. ``President Reagan personally
authorized the entire plan.''
   Later in February, it says, McFarlane asked Weinberger to
``commence expedited delivery of military items, as previously
planned and personally authorized by President Reagan,'' to
Honduras.
   In testimony before the congressional panels, Weinberger was
asked what steps his department had taken to comply with the
congressional cutoff of U.S. military aid to the rebels. He
replied, ``Well, we issued ... any instructions that were required
by the new law. But we didn't have any activities there. So we
weren't really monitoring anything that wasn't happening.''
   Reagan's spokesman, Mark Weinberg, declined comment Friday on
the revelations. ``This is a pending legal matter and we do not
comment on developments in this trial,'' Weinberg said by telephone
from Los Angeles.
   Neither Shultz nor Weinberger immediately returned telephone
calls placed to their offices. Weinberger is with a Washington law
firm and Shultz is on the faculty at Stanford University in Palo
Alto, Calif.
   The statement of facts also quoted the late CIA Director William
Casey as saying at a meeting with CIA and State Department
officials in mid-July of 1984 that ``those present ought to get
moving'' on obtaining funds for the Contras from sources other than
the U.S. government.
   It goes on to quote Casey as saying in that meeting that William
French Smith, then attorney general, ``had recently concluded that
raising the funds in this manner would not be an impeachable
offense.'' The statement says the possibility of impeachment had
been raised at a meeting of a national security planning group on
June 25, 1984.
   Smith said by telephone from Los Angeles, ``I don't remember
ever being involved in any conversation where there was any serious
talk of impeachment.'
   ``At that time, nothing had happened, so I don't know why
anybody would be talking about impeachment at that point,'' he
said. ``When I say nothing had happened, I mean nothing had
happened that anybody knew about.''
   President Bush, at a news conference Friday, declined to discuss
the document introduced at the trial, and said that all of the
information in it had been provided to the Tower Commission and
congressional investigators.
   Neither former Sen. John G. Tower, R-Texas, chairman of the
commission, nor former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, its
Democratic member, immediately returned telephone calls to their
offices seeking comment.
   The third member of the commission, Brent Scowcroft, is now
Bush's national security adviser. A telephone call to him was
referred to his spokemsan, Roman Popadiuk, who also did not
immediately return a call.
   Sarah Binder, press secretary to Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
chairman of the House Iran-Contra committee, said Hamilton would
have no comment until he had studied the document. Gregg Takayama,
spokesman for Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairmana of the Senate
panel, said the senator ``has not wanted to comment on the evidence
that has come out at the trial.''

   An American priest who returned 14
years after being expelled for alleged anti-government activity
said Friday he likes the noisy sound of democracy but officials
told him not to step out of line.
   ``What's going on here is healthier than what I saw the last
time I was here,'' said the Rev. James P. Sinnott, who arrived
Wednesday. ``To me, there's nothing worse than the silence of
suppression.''
   ``The price of democracy is a certain amount of disorder, a
certain upsetness,'' said Sinnot, 59, referring to current student
and labor unrest against the government of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Roh took office last year, succeeding the Chun Doo-hwan and his
military government, and has brought about democratic reforms.
   But Sinnott, now with Maryknoll Missionaries in Ossining, N.Y.,
said government officials have a certain amount of ``paranoia''
about his return.
   Police asked him for his itinerary and the names of people he
plans to visit, he said. Within 24 hours of his arrival,
immigration authorities warned him not to engage in missionary work
or human rights campaigns.
   Sinnott was expelled April 30, 1975, after he protested the
arrest and execution of eight men charged with masterminding a
communist plot against the government, a charge Sinnott says was
fabricated.
   At the airport on his departure, Sinnott donned a black hood
representing death and pictures of that event dramatized for human
rights activitists around the world a period of government
repression in South Korea.
   He was able to return, he said, after intervention on his behalf
by Lee Chul, an outspoken South Korean lawmaker and friend who in
the early 1970s was once condemned to death for student activism.
   Sinnott said he wasn't always an activist. For 14 of the 15
years he lived in Korea, he worked in a parish at Yongjongdo, an
island near the western port of Inchon.
   ``I was happy running a hospital, taking care of little
children. I thought of myself as Albert Schweitzer,'' he said. ``I
came from an upward mobile Irish family in Brooklyn, very content
with life. Civil disobedience was a thing `commies' do.''
   He said he was jolted to change by a decree issued in April 1974
in which the government said students who publicly criticized the
government could be sentenced to death.
   ``My good old-fashioned World War II American patriotism got to
me. Fifty-thousand men my age died in Korea (during the 1950-53
Korean War). I told myself `if you don't say something, you'll
suffocate.'''
   A U.S. diplomat first called him a dissident. ``I thought, my
God if I'm a dissident, then there's something wrong. In my
culture, dissident was a bad word,'' he said. ``I now accept it as
an honorable title.''
   Sinnott said he became tied to the case of the eight men after
their wives and families appealed to the church for help, and
church leaders told him to follow his conscience.
   ``They were ordinary men with a liberal bent. One was a
bathhouse manager, one a bookeeper, one a Japanese language school
teacher, and another an English high school teacher,'' he said.
   The eight had been student dissidents in college but otherwise
had little in common, he said. ``Some didn't even know one
another.''
   Sinnott said the government wanted a case to demonstrate it
could severely punish what it considered anti-government or
communist activity. The eight were chosen, he said, precisely
because they did not belong to an organized group which might bring
pressure against the government.
   Sinnott and church sympathizers took to the streets shouting
``Chojak! Chojak!'' _ ``Fabrication! Fabrication!'' but the men
were executed April 9, 1975.
   ``Korean police were never, ever cruel to me,'' he said,
recalling one police captain who came forward to block a protest
march and greeted him with a traditional bow, then started pushing.

<HEAD>Milken, Brother Plead Innocent To Racketeering, Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, the junk bond wizard who helped
make Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. a Wall Street powerhouse, pleaded
innocent Friday to a wide-ranging federal indictment that charged
him with turning the firm into a racketeering enterprise.
   Milken entered his plea in a courtroom packed with more than 200
reporters, lawyers and friends. Outside, dozens of supporters, some
wearing hats that read ``Mike Milken We Believe in You,'' applauded
and cheered him as he left the courthouse without comment.
   Also pleading innocent before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood at
federal court in Manhattan was Milken's brother, Lowell, 40. A
third defendant, former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg, was absent
due to a skiing accident. He will be arraigned at a later date.
   All three were named in a 98-count federal securities fraud and
racketeering indictment handed up by a grand jury March 29.
   Michael Milken, tanned and smiling, entered the courtroom from a
rear door flanked by his lawyers Arthur Liman and Martin
Flumenbaum. His wife, Lori, sat in the second row of the crowded
spectator section.
   The standing room only crowd laughed when Ms. Wood asked him how
he felt and Michael Milken replied, ``OK, your honor.''
   Lowell Milken, dressed in a gray suit said, ``I plead not
guilty'' in a loud firm voice when asked by the judge.
   Both Milkens were released without having to post bail after
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said prosecutors and defense
lawyers had ``made substantial progress'' during talks to reach an
acceptable bond for the defendants and their assets.
   The charges seek $1.8 billion in forfeitures from each of the
three defendants, or their total combined earnings from 1984 to
1987. The government reportedly had asked the three defendants each
to post a $1 billion bond to avoid pretrial restraints on their
assets.
   Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
act, assets found to be the result of racketeering activities are
subject to forfeiture and prosecutors could ask the judge to freeze
the Milkens' assets to guarantee their availability in the event of
conviction.
   If convicted, each of the three also faces maximum fines of $3.7
billion if convicted on either or both of the racketeering counts.
   Those fines represent the highest possible amounts under federal
   racketeering law _ double the gains made from the allegedly
illegal enterprise _ that a judge may impose.
   Ms. Wood scheduled another court session for Tuesday morning to
finalize bond arrangements. The judge also scheduled Newberg's
arraignment April 25.
   Following his indictment, Milken, 42, took a leave of absence
from his job as head of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based
high-yield junk bond division, where he reportedly made more than
$1 billion between 1983 and 1987.
   Milken widely is considered a pioneer in making the low-grade
securities a key source of financing for a wide range of corporate
deals. He is also credited with helping to transform Drexel into a
major investment banking house.
   The racketeering indictment followed an investigation of Wall
Street's fifth-largest investment firm that lasted more than two
years. The probe was prompted by information supplied by convicted
stock speculator Ivan Boesky.

   An assailant who lost a court battle to
block his comatose victim from being removed from life support
could face a murder charge now that the man has died, prosecutors
said Friday.
   Twenty-six-year-old Mark Weaver died Friday, eight days after
his family removed his feeding tube and four years after the
stabbing that left him in a coma. Noel Pagan, who pleaded guilty to
assaulting Weaver, waged an unsuccessful court battle to keep him
alive to avoid risking more serious charges.
   ``We haven't ruled anything in or out,'' the chief of the
attorney general's criminal division, Fernand LaRochelle, said when
asked Friday whether homicide charges would be sought. ``We're just
trying to determine what the evidence is.''
   A medical examiner was performing an autopsy at Maine Medical
Center, but authorities did not know how soon it would be
completed. Attorney General James E. Tierney would not comment on
the type of autopsy findings would be necessary before Pagan could
be charged with Weaver's death.
   ``I'm not going to answer any hypothetical questions about an
autopsy being conducted,'' Tierney said.
   Weaver's mother, Sylvia Lane, said her son died at about 2 a.m.
   ``He died peacefully,'' she said. ``He never had a moment's
pain.''
   When she removed her son's feeding tube just after midnight
March 30, she had said it would take from one to two weeks for him
to die.
   Pagan's attorney, Robert Mullen, said he would try to persuade
prosecutors that no additional charges should be filed.
   ``It's up to them,'' Mullen said. ``I'll probably call them and
say, now that he's passed away, I'd like to do anything I can to
talk them out of charges.''
   While her son was still alive, Ms. Lane had said that it would
make no sense to seek further punishment of Pagan, who is now on
probation and living in Wellesley, Mass. Mullen said Pagan, 29, has
been staying out of trouble since his release after three years in
prison.
   Janet Mills, the Androscoggin County district attorney who
negotiated Pagan's guilty plea to an aggravated assault charge in
1985, said the stabbing occurred during a ``stupid street fight''
in Lewiston.
   Authorities believe Pagan and Weaver did not even know each
other, Ms. Mills said Friday from Auburn. ``It wasn't like one of
them set out to murder the other,'' she said. ``I think Weaver was
calling some names.''
   Mullen said that if charges are filed, he will try to get them
thrown out with motions instead of going to trial.
   He said he would cite constitutional provisions against trying
people twice for the same offense and a state law providing that a
person must die within a year and a day of an attack before the
attacker can be charged with murder or manslaughter.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Sheds Some Light on Nuclear Weapons Production</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gorbachev, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's declared intention to close
facilities that produce weapons-grade radioactive material is the
first comment by a Soviet leader on an area that has been a deep
military secret.
   Under the Soviet leader's reform policies, and in arms
negotiations, some information has been given about conventional
forces, chemical weapons and nuclear missiles.
   He has used this more open attitude to press the United States
and its allies for arms control agreements Gorbachev needs to
redirect Soviet resources toward making the economy work.
   Until he spoke Friday in London, revelations about production of
uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons remained off-limits.
   Gorbachev said: ``In addition to the industrial reactor for the
production of weapons-grade plutonium shut down in 1987, we plan to
shut down two other such reactors this year and next year without
commissioning new units to replace them.''
   The Soviet Union began allowing inspection of nuclear power
plants after the April 1986 explosion and fire at Chernobyl, which
killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of radiation that
spread around the world.
   It had not announced the closing of the reactor in 1987,
however, and no information had been available on what kinds of
facilities, or how many, the Soviets had for producing
weapons-grade material.
   ``U.S.S.R. Energy Atlas,'' a CIA study of all Soviet energy
sources, devotes only a little more than three of its 70 pages to
nuclear power because so much is concealed.
   ``Information on the Soviet uranium industry is a closely
guarded state secret,'' the report says. ``Only limited data on
uranium occurrences in the Soviet Union and minor details on
reserves, mining and processing operations have been published.''
   Francois Heisbourg, director of the Institute of Strategic
Studies in London, said after Gorbachev's announcement the Soviets
have a considerable stockpile of plutonium for nuclear weapon.
   Under the U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating intermediate-range
nuclear missiles, U.S. inspectors have been given the unprecedented
right to inspect Soviet missile sites.
   Fifteen inspections were made last summer to verify deployment
sites and numbers and classes of weapons to be destroyed. Tass, the
official news agency, quoted Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie as saying he
was ``staggered'' by the openness showed by the Soviets.
   In September, observers were allowed to witness a Soviet nuclear
test.
   Soviet officials have said that, after the U.S.-Soviet missile
treaty and Gorbachev's announcement at the United Nations in
December of unilateral military cuts, they are converting some arms
plants to produce goods for the domestic economy.
   Officials said Dec. 21 the engines from 10,000 decommissioned
tanks would be diverted to domestic use. Several weeks later, state
media reported that 250 arms plants would be incorporated into
efforts to design and build new food processing equipment.

Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 40-hour visit to Britain that ended Friday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In a major speech in London, Gorbachev announced cutbacks in
production of radioactive material for nuclear weapons. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher said it was of no practical importance
because the Soviets already had all the material they needed.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev said that if the West upgrades short-range nuclear
missiles in Europe, the arms control process could stall. Mrs.
Thatcher reiterated her belief in nuclear deterrence and said
modernization must proceed as planned.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev invited Queen Elizabeth II to visit the Soviet Union,
and Mrs. Thatcher, who makes the final decision, said she was
delighted _ ``It is a very definite yes.'' The queen will be the
first British sovereign to visit the Soviet Union since the Russian
royal family, her cousins, were murdered after the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   A shadow fell over the summit as the Soviets confirmed _
following reports leaked by the U.S. administration _ that they
sold warplanes to Libya. Mrs. Thatcher complained to Gorbachev
about the sale to what she called a ``terrorist state,'' and said
later, ``We are deeply concerned.''

   Gorbachev waded into crowds, first on Thursday after laying a
wreath at Westminster Abbey, and on Friday stopping his motorcade
in the middle of the City, London's financial district. Crowds were
delighted and so was Gorbachev, using a favorite tactic for wooing
Western opinion.

   He declared perestroika (restructuring) is irreversible. ``There
is no turning back for anyone. The people have firmly linked their
destiny with perestroika.''

<HEAD>GAO Says Current Law Has Bettered Farmers' Lot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report to Congress said Friday that current
farm law, which is set to expire next year, has helped improve the
state of U.S. agriculture.
   The General Accounting Office said the Food Security Act of 1985
was designed to help stabilize the farm economy, enhance U.S.
agricultural exports and prevent the buildup of large surplus
stocks of commodities.
   John W. Harman, GAO's director of food and agriculture issues,
said that in summary ``progress has been made toward the major
goals'' of the 1985 law.
   ``Most economic indicators have turned positive,'' Harman said.
``Exports have increased. And stock levels (of surplus commodities)
have generally moved lower.''
   But Harman said in his letter to Sens. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.,
and Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who had asked for the GAO study, that
while the 1985 law has been a factor, ``it is uncertain how much
progress can be attributed to the legislation versus other
important factors such as monetary exchange rates.''
   The law includes a number of provisions that enabled the Reagan
administration to pursue its goal of ``market-oriented''
agriculture, including lower support prices for major farm
commodities so they could compete more easily in world trade.
   Similar goals have been expressed by the Bush administration,
including Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who has pushed
vigorously for more global elbow room for U.S. products.
   The report said that USDA's total costs for price and income
supports, and export programs were ``slightly higher under the
first three full years'' of the 1985 farm law than in the last
three full years of the previous legislation.
   Also, it said, USDA has had higher administrative costs
``because it increased staff levels to handle the greater work
load'' under the 1985 law. ``Even with more staff, USDA has found
its greater responsibilities difficult to administer,'' the report
added.
   The previous law, which was adopted in 1981, cost about $43.8
billion for its final three full years, compared with $48.7 billion
in the first three full years of the 1985 law, the report said.
   GAO said those figures did not include fiscal 1986 _ when total
farm commodity outlays were a record of $25.8 billion _ because it
was a transition year in which some spending were attributable to
crops produced under the 1981 law's programs and other crops under
the 1985 version.

<HEAD>U.S. Praises Call By Lebanese Christian for Political Reform</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Friday praised a call by
a leader of Lebanon's Christians for political reform, saying it
could open the way to resolving some of the fundamental problems
tearing the country apart.
   The comments appeared to indicate a State Department tilt toward
the Christians, who have been fighting a coalition of Moslem
militiamen and their Syrian backers in the worst round of civil
violence Lebanon has known for four years.
   It was the first time in the latest round of artillery duels,
which began four weeks ago, that the State Department has departed
from its language of neutrality.
   Gen. Michel Aoun, who leads the Christian units in Lebanon's
army, on Thursday called for a conference between the warring sides
to discuss power-sharing between Christians and Moslems.
   ``We have achieved equality in humiliation for 14 years,'' Aoun
said. ``We have to acquire equality today in responsibility,
liberation, dignity and partnership.''
   ``We have to be partners in making out destiny, because this
partnership alone is bound to realize justice, equality and equal
opportunities in a full national sense,'' he said.
   Aoun said the Lebanese will have to pay much more dearly if they
delay in achieving unity, security, dignity, stability and
reconstruction of their homeland.
   ``We welcome the commitment that General Aoun made,'' said the
State Department. ``We applaud his recognition that all Lebanese
have the right to security, liberty, and dignity.''
   Lebanon's factional violence stems from a political structure
instituted in the 1940s which favors the Christians over the
Moslems. But the Moslems, who have increased their numbers and now
constitute a majority in Lebanon, are demanding a bigger share in
running the country.
   Syria sent troops into Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate, but Lebanon's Christians contend the 40,000
Syrians are now an occupying power.
   ``We are required at once to reject subordination and to rebel
against the oppressive foreign will,'' Aoun said. ``We must
overthrow all dictated barriers and handicaps that would lead to
partition and meet around a Lebanese-Lebanese table for a free,
meaningful, open and honest national dialogue.''
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said Aoun's call
is ``another step down the road'' to a settlement in Lebanon. But
he conceded that ``I can't say that we can be optimistic about the
situation. I think this shows a path to resolving some of the
fundamental problems that are there, and that's why we support it.''

   President Bush, declaring that ``the climate
is better than it's been for a while,'' said Friday that the
election plan for Palestinian Arabs proposed by Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir represents a welcome step toward progress
in the Middle East peace process.
   Shamir, meantime, told reporters he sees no role for the
Palestine Liberation Organization in persuading the Arab residents
of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza to take part in such
elections.
   ``In the Middle East, a little step sometimes can ... prove to
be fruitful,'' Bush said, adding that ``I think the climate is
better than it's been for a while.''
   Bush, answering questions from reporters at the White House,
said it is too early for him to consider traveling to the region to
try to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Asked if he saw himself getting personally involved over the
course of his presidency in trying to deal with the situation, Bush
said that ``if I felt that being immersed in it would help solve
the problem of peace in the Middle East, I would do that.''
   But he said that ``it is not a time when a lot of
high-visibility missions on the part of the president ... can be
helpful in the process.''
   As for the proposed elections, which Shamir suggested as a way
to select Arab delegates to meet with the Israeli government, Bush
was asked whether the PLO should have a role.
   Bush said that ``we haven't fully resolved exactly who's going
to have a role but I think that's a matter to be determined ...
between the parties. ... The PLO has people living on the West
Bank. ... We want to see elections that are free and fair there.''
   Shamir, speaking with reporters after meeting at the Capitol
with Senate leaders and members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, made clear he intends to avoid PLO participation.
   ``I don't think the PLO could help,'' he said. ``I see the PLO
always as an obstacle on the way to peace in our area. The PLO is
against peace with us and therefore I cannot say anything about any
way the PLO could help.''
   Shamir was asked whether, in that case, elections represent a
dead end.
   He did not reply directly but said:
   ``As I said before, the PLO is against all of my proposals
because they don't want to see us _ to see Israel _ in peace
relations with the Arab peoples and nations. And therefore it is
useless to talk with the PLO.''
   Later, in an interview with Cable News Network, Shamir said that
elections can be held even if some of the Palestinian participants
are sympathetic to the PLO ``if these people will accept the
principle, ... accept the process of negotiations.''
   Shamir's plan calls for the election of Palestinian leaders to
negotiate temporary self-rule. After a trial period, he proposes to
have Israel, the Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan work out a
permanent settlement.
   Shamir told CNN the process would take ``at least five years,''
and that the initial period of self-rule would be ``a test to see
if it is possible to have peaceful coexistence.''
   The 1978 Camp David accords called for a five-year trial period
of Palestinian autonomy followed by negotiations for an overall
final settlement.
   Shamir presented his proposal to Bush on Thursday. At a news
conference, the prime minister ruled out having international
observers on hand for the elections which he said would be run by
Israeli officials.
   ``We do not think there is a need of international
supervision,'' he said. ``Israel has a long tradition of democracy
and decent and honest elections.''
   Shamir contends a majority of the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs
living under Israeli control would take part in such elections
because they want a peaceful solution.
   Violence has held sway in the occupied lands since a Palestinian
uprising erupted in December 1987, killing 420 Palestinians and 18
Israelis.
   Shamir opposes establishment of an independent Palestinian state
on the West Bank and in Gaza, saying an Arab nation there would
become a launching pad for terrorist strikes against Israel.

<HEAD>Man Who Claimed Wife Was Wrongfully Killed Has Two _ Both Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE FAHLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who claimed the city was negligent in the
traffic death of his wife actually has two wives _ and both of them
are alive.
   Police began piecing together the saga of Robert Jerome Brown of
Dallas when he was arrested for auto theft last month.
   That started Texas and Arkansas officials on whirlwind
investigation that has uncovered suspects in an unsolved 1986
slaying, a phony identification of a traffic accident victim and
two wives _ one of whom says she was never near a Dallas freeway
accident that Brown contended had killed her.
   Brown, 33, and one of his wives, Sonja Brown, 20, remained
jailed Friday in Malvern, Ark., on capital murder charges stemming
from an unrelated incident.
   The two face arraignment on the capital murder charges Monday,
officials said.
   ``This is a very bizarre case,'' said homicide Detective James
Gallagher. ``If he didn't have this small problem with this
homicide case up in Arkansas, I'm sure we'd see quite a few more
charges against him.''
   In January 1988, Brown identified the body of a woman who was
struck and killed while walking across a Dallas highway as his
estranged wife, Jacquelyn Brown, 34, of Alport, Ark. When Brown
said he had no money to bury his wife, the body was placed in a
Dallas County pauper's grave.
   Then Brown allegedly hired an attorney to file a wrongful death
lawsuit against the city, claiming negligence in not placing a
street light in the area.
   But Brown's other wife, Sonja, tipped off Gallagher that there
might be something mysterious about Jacquelyn Brown's ``death.''
   Gallagher called Jacquelyn Brown's parents after reviewing her
death certificate and was startled to learn the woman was still
alive. He also learned the woman had been estranged from Brown for
several years but never divorced.
   ``Initially she was surprised,'' Gallagher said of Jacquelyn
Brown's reaction to the news of her reported death. ``But then when
I told her who had made these allegations, she wasn't too
surprised.''
   Calls from The Associated Press to Jacquelyn Brown's home in
Arkansas were not answered Friday.
   Brown, a Stuttgart, Ark., native who had been living in Dallas,
was apprehended March 3 while driving through Texas to Shreveport,
La. The car had been stolen in Arkansas, said Hot Springs (Ark.)
County Chief Deputy Leonard Tisdale.
   Under questioning by Arkansas officials, Brown confessed that he
and his wife Sonja had strangled a Little Rock prostitute in 1986
and left her body on Interstate 30, Tisdale said.
   The body of Gloria J. Reynolds, 24, was found about six miles
south of Malvern, just past a highway rest stop, on Dec. 4, 1986,
Tisdale said. She had been robbed of $50 and strangled with a belt.
   Gallagher said Dallas police began questioning Sonja Brown about
her alleged role in the murder and she admitted Brown had told her
he was somehow involved in Jacquelyn's ``death.''
   When Jacquelyn Brown was found alive, Dallas police began an
investigation into the real identity of the traffic accident victim.
   Gallagher said he is waiting for fingerprints to arrive from Los
Angeles to confirm who is in the grave.
   Gallagher said police believe Brown's motive in claiming the
unidentified body appears to be money from the lawsuit against the
city, but he never followed up on the suit.

<HEAD>Texas Governor Seeks Review Of Foreign Participation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign participation in the super collider
raises national security implications that must be investigated,
Texas Gov. Bill Clements said Friday as he sought such a review
from President Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``Before we actively pursue foreign participation'' in the
project, due to be built in his state, ``we have an obligation to
make a considered judgment on what are the national security
implications in this project. This is a vitally important
question,'' Clements said.
   Clements met with Bush and said he had also raised the issue
with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Cheney: Energy Secretary James
Watkins; National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, and members of
Congress including Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., whose House
appropriations subcommittee will set spending for the collider in
next year's budget.
   ``Everybody's in agreement that an evaluation of the national
security aspect has to be thoroughly explored and determined before
we get in to some kind of a foreign participation,'' Clements said.
   At a recent hearing of his subcommittee, Bevill suggested
Congress would not be willing to fund construction of the collider
unless foreign governments agree to help pay for it. Bevill said
Congress would insist on knowing specifically how much each foreign
contributor planned to spend. Bush is seeking $250 million to begin
construction next year for the particle accelerator at a site south
of Dallas.
   Clements said he met with Bevill on Thursday, and ``he
acknowledges that this area of national security needs to be fully
explored.''

   Property owners stood in line at
emergency management offices Friday in Minnesota and North Dakota
to buy sandbags to protect their homes from one of the worst floods
this century on the Red River.
   ``We just can't keep up,'' said Jim Grondahl, Clay County
emergency services director in Moorhead. ``We went through another
11,000 (bags) this morning and I've got more on order.''
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, meanwhile, hurried to complete
temporary earthen dikes to protect public facilities in both
Moorhead and neighboring Fargo, N.D.
   Spring floods are common on the Red River. But it had risen to a
level of 31{ feet Friday _ flood stage is 17 feet _ and was
expected to crest at 36{ feet late Sunday or Monday, making it the
second-worst flood this century in the two cities. The river rose
to 37.3 feet during a 1969 flood.
   The 533-mile river forms the boundary between Minnesota and
North Dakota and flows north into Lake Winnipeg in Canada.
   Runoff from the winter's heavy snowfall _ 72.3 inches all season
in Fargo, third highest on record _ sent the Red and two adjoining
rivers over their banks earlier this week in the communities of
Breckenridge and Wahpeton, N.D., forcing the evacuation of scores
of residents and damaging hundreds of homes.
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich and North Dakota Gov. George Sinner
toured the flood-stricken area and both declared states of
emergency, the first step in seeking federal relief for the
communities.
   Officials expected damages to mount into the millions of dollars
in Breckenridge and less than $1 million in Wahpeton. The two
communities are 45 miles south of Fargo-Moorhead.
   Parts of Breckenridge and Wahpeton were still under water
Friday, although the river was receding.
   ``I've lived here a long time and I've never seen it like
this,'' Willard Eckes of Wahpeton said earlier this week. ``This is
something that comes along only once in a lifetime.''
   More than a quarter-million sandbags had been sold through
Friday in Fargo-Moorhead. Radio stations carried appeals for
volunteers to help with sandbagging efforts.
   The Corps of Engineers hoped to complete work on six large
levees in the two cities Friday. One dike was built on a street
just a block from Fargo City Hall.

   President Bush welcomed President-elect
Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador to the White House on Friday,
assuring him of U.S. support for his rightist government in
battling leftist rebels.
   Cristiani and a White House statement issued after their Oval
Office meeting said the two discussed a shared commitment to
democracy and protection of human rights in El Salvador.
   Earlier in the day, Cristiani rejected a proposal by the rebels
that he declare his forthcoming administration a transitional
government and call for new elections. In return, the rebels would
have agreed to a ceasefire.
   The human rights question has been controversial for Cristiani
as head of the right-wing Arena party, which, along with its
founder Roberto D'Abuisson, has been accused of affiliations with
rightist death squads that have killed tens of thousands of
leftists.
   An administration source said one purpose of the White House
meeting was to underscore U.S. expectations that the new Salvadoran
government, which replaces the moderate Christian Democratic
government of Jose Napoleon Duarte, will be aggressive in keeping
human rights violations in check.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, on a trip to El Salvador in Feburary,
delivered a strong pro-human rights message to the military forces,
linking improved performance in that area with the continuation of
U.S. aid to the Central American nation.
   The White House said that Bush dismissed those who have
prejudged Cristiani and contend he will be weak on human rights.
Bush restated his view ``that Mr. Cristiani should be given the
chance to prove his dedication to democracy, peace and human
rights.''
   Bush also ``noted with satisfaction'' Cristiani's efforts in
getting court charges in a human rights case reinstated after a
judge threw out the case and ordered the release of two military
men and a landowner accused of involvement in a kidnap-for-profit
ring, the White House said.
   ``He said it showed we really meant it when we said that we are
willing to work for the respect of human rights in Salvador,''
Cristiani said.
   The ceasefire proposal by the rebels, announced Thursday,
contemplated elections six months after a ceasefire was in place.
   The proposal demanded the withdrawal of U.S. aid and military
advisers to El Salvador and would have barred military forces from
polling places.
   But Cristiani, who handily defeated his opponents in the March
19 ballotting, rejected the plan, saying he would not consider
naming his a transitional government as proposed by the rebel
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   He said his government will be willing to talk with the rebels
to ``try to seek a means to bring them into the political civililan
life in El Salvador.''

   President Bush on Friday shrugged off
complaints by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the U.S.
review of arms control policy was delaying negotiations to harness
the nuclear arms race.
   ``We are making a prudent review I will be ready to discuss with
the Soviets when we are ready,'' Bush said. ``And so, and Mr.
Gorbachev knows, that there is no foot-dragging going on, so I'm
not concerned in the least.''
   The State Department, meanwhile, dismissed as meaningless an
announcement by Gorbachev that he would close two more nuclear
reactors that produce weapons-grade uranium.
   ``It will not restrain their nuclear weapons program,''
spokesman Richard Boucher said. ``It's not really a change in
Soviet nuclear production capabilities.''
   He said the Soviets would retain military and civilian plants
that produce material that could be used for weapons.
   The coolness of the U.S. reaction to Gorbachev was enhanced
later by a State Department announcement that listening devices had
been discovered at the U.S. consulate in Leningrad.
   A brief statement said the department had protested, telling the
Soviets ``such hostile attempts at intelligence gathering, however
long ago they may have been initiated, are deeply resented by the
American people.''
   Gorbachev, on a visit to Britain, said through a spokesman on
Thursday that in arms control ``continuity is the name of the game.
We are a little bit apprehensive we could be losing it.''
   Bush, with a flash of irritation in a session in the White House
press room, said he would be ready to discuss the arms situation
with the Soviets when his administration's review is completed.
That is expected at the end of the month or, at the latest, in
early May.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will go to Moscow May
10-11 to discuss the suspended negotiations with the Soviets and
also prospects for a first summit meeting between Bush and
Gorbachev.
   The State Department, in announcing the trip, said Baker would
stop at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, on the way home to brief U.S. allies on the
results.
   The negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear missiles, bombers
and submarines went into recess in December and were tentatively
set to resume in mid-February. But the Bush administration
postponed the resumption for the review, which includes an analysis
of U.S. nuclear forces.
   On a related subject, Gorbachev promised Friday to make deep
cuts in the Soviet military and made the announcement that he would
close two more nuclear reactors.
   Asked for his appraisal, Bush deflected the question. ``We will
react when we are ready to react,'' he said.
   Bush had said previously he would not be ``stampeded'' by
Gorbachev's various initiatives, which included a pledge to reduce
Soviet troops by 500,000 and to remove six tank divisions from
Eastern Europe.
   Gorbachev criticized the lengthy U.S. review through Gennady
Gerasimov, the Soviet foreign policy spokesman, who said on
Thursday ``the new administration has not yet decided what position
to take, how to interpret the international scene. Continuity is
the name of the game.''
   Administration officials suspect the Soviets' tactic may be to
try to promote division within NATO. Bush and Baker will meet with
leaders of the alliance in Brussels at the end of May.
   Asked if the allies were critical of the review, Boucher said:
``I haven't heard any such criticism.''
   On another subject, Bush called the pace of reform in Poland
``mind-boggling'' and ``all very encouraging.''
   On Wednesday, Polish government authorities agreed to legalize
Solidarity, the independent trade union, and to provide for
democratic elections in the East European country.
   Bush said he had not decided whether he should consider a visit
to Poland.
   Asked about the Middle East, the president described the
situation as marginally improved.
   Referring to a proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
to hold elections among Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in
Gaza, the president said:
   ``In the Middle East, a little step sometimes can be fruitful. I
think the climate is better than it has been.''
   But Bush said it was too early for him to consider traveling to
the region to try to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``If I personally can be helpful, I am going to do it,'' he
said, but ``it is not a time when a lot of high-visibility missions
on the part of the president can be helpful in the process.''
   As for the proposed elections, which Shamir suggested as a way
to find Palestinian leaders to work out local self-rule with his
government, Bush said:
   ``We haven't fully resolved exactly who's going to have a role;
that's a matter to be determined between the parties. ... The PLO
has people living on the West Bank. ... We want to see elections
that are free and fair.''

<HEAD>UNESCO Leader Calls for Release of Hostages, Peace in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of UNESCO on Friday called for freedom for
two journalists and other hostages held in Lebanon and an end to
violence in that country.
   Federico Mayor, director-general of the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, noted the third anniversary
on April 17 of the kidnapping of British television journalist John
McCarthy, 32.
   Mayor said in a statement that the British journalist ``has now
passed three years of his life deprived of his freedom, denied the
right to exercise his profession and robbed of the joys of home and
family.
   ``Alas, he is not alone. Others are in the same intolerable
situation in the Middle East, including another journalist, Terry
Anderson.''
   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, began his fifth year in captivity in Lebanon three weeks
ago. He was abducted March 16, 1985, and is the longest-held among
the 15 foreign hostages, who include nine Americans.
   A group of British, French and other journalists are organizing
a ceremony at UNESCO April 17 to mark McCarthy's captivity.
   Mayor said UNESCO is deeply concerned with the fate of the
hostages because one of its responsibilities in advancing
individual human rights is to promote the free exchange of ideas.
   Officials say different factions hold the hostages, but they all
are under the umbrella group Hezbollah, over which Iran is believed
to exercise control. Last week Mayor sent an envoy to talk with the
Iranian government.
   Mayor also said he was concerned about the people of Lebanon
because April 13 marks the 14th anniversary of the civil war in
that eastern Mediterranean country. For weeks now, Moslem and
Christian forces have been engaged in heavy artillery battles in
and around Beirut.
   ``I appeal to all governments concerned and to the international
community at large to do everthing within their power to end the
long suffering and hardship of this afflicted people,'' he said.

   Palestinians made clear Friday a U.S.-backed
Israeli call for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip would
not stop the uprising against Israeli occupation.
   Demonstrations in Jerusalem and the West Bank followed hard on
the heels of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's meeting
Thursday with President Bush. The protests signaled that
Palestinians believe the U.S. pledge to work on the election idea
was inadequate.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, speaking in the Congo, attacked
Shamir's proposal as ``inappropriate, as usual'' and vowed the
uprising would continue ``until victory.'' He reiterated a call for
an international conference, but it was uncertain from his comments
whether he ruled out the election idea.
   In Amman, Jordan, two elected mayors deported from the
Israeli-occupied West Bank denounced Shamir's proposed elections.
   ``As one who was elected back in 1976, I would remind Mr. Shamir
that those who were elected are either expelled (by the Israelis)
or dead or dismissed,'' said Mohammed Milhem, former mayor of
Halhoul, deported in 1980.
   Abdul-Jawad Saleh, mayor of El-Bireh until he was deported in
1973, said: ``The problem is they didn't understand that we are one
people with one leadership (the PLO).''
   Both men, in interviews, supported PLO suggestions that
elections might take place after Israel withdraws from the
territories.
   Some influential Palestinians in the occupied territories
indicated elections might be possible if certain conditions were
met, such as U.N. supervision and a withdrawal of Israeli troops.
Their comments appeared to give the U.S. government some leeway to
explore the idea.
   ``The PLO doesn't even have to openly agree to the idea. The PLO
just has to let the process start. We just need an atmosphere that
will let things take off,'' said an Israeli official who demanded
anonymity.
   Shamir's plan is to hold elections in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip to choose Palestinian representatives to talk with
Israel about establishing autonomy as an interim arrangement. Talks
on the ultimate disposition of the war-won land would be left until
later.
   But many Palestinians said they feared he sought only an
arrangement to halt the uprising and was not sincere about seeking
a long-term settlement.
   ``The interim solution will become a permanent solution. We have
no trust in the Israeli side on this matter,'' said Nablus
businessman Said Kenaan.
   In a television interview Friday, Shamir said: ``If we reach an
agreed solution'' in the negotiations, ``it would not be possible
to call it occupation. In any case, it will not be occupation.''
   Nabil Jabari, chairman of the now-closed Hebron University in
the West Bank, said the Palestine Liberation Organization would
have to authorize an international body to supervise the balloting
and elections would have to be part of a larger settlement.
   ``I could not agree to elections if it is only elections. It
must be part of a package to solve the Palestinian problem,'' said
Jabari, who spent 65 days in jail without trial for pro-PLO
activities during the uprising.
   Palestinians interviewed Friday said Israel would have to accept
giving up land it seized in the 1967 Middle East war and end the
military occupation over the 1.7 million Arabs in the West Bank and
Gaza.
   ``Shamir has to announce that ... he accepts the principle of
territory for peace,'' said Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij, who
received death threats earlier this year after proposing a truce in
the uprising in exchange for elections and prisoner releases.
   Palestinian leftists and pro-Syrian supporters ruled out
Shamir's latest proposal.
   ``No and a thousand times no to the elections and even to the
dialogue with Israelis under occupation,'' said Sufian Khatib of
Jerusalem, a surgeon whose views are associated with Damascus-based
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr newspaper,
said he thinks the uprising in the occupied lands ``will continue
until Shamir comes up with a better proposal.''
   An Israeli official who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity said Shamir's proposal to Bush did not link elections to
the return of calm to the West Bank and Gaza where at least 419
Palestinians have died since December 1987.
   The official said Israel hoped that international reaction would
be favorable to the election idea. ``If international public
opinion accepts, I think the Palestinians would not have an easy
time rejecting it,'' he said.
   The liberal daily Haaretz and the conservative Maaariv
newspapers concurred Shamir had only won a ``time out.'' Haaretz
said ``the impression is that the Bush administration is not going
to let Shamir off the hook soon.''
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of the left-leaning Labor
Party and Shamir's rival in the coalition government, expressed
some skepticism about Shamir's plan. ``I still (don't see) a second
side for negotiations, and the question is whether we can find
Palestinian representatives,'' he was quoted as saying by the
national news agency Itim.

<HEAD>North Says He Lied to Congress, but Merely ``Pawn'' for Superiors</HEAD>

   Oliver North conceded Friday he lied to
congressmen who came to the White House to question him about the
Contras, but he said he didn't think it was unlawful because the
things he was hiding, ``I was told, could not, should not be
revealed.''
   ``I felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants,''
he testified.
   The courtroom at his criminal trial was packed and long lines
formed in the hallway outside as the former National Security
Council aide spent his second day in the witness chair, undergoing
gentle examination by his own lawyer, Brendan Sullivan.
   At the White House, meanwhile, President Bush, citing concern
about ``endangering the trial,'' refused to answer questions about
his own role in aiding the Contras, as disclosed in a lengthy
``admission of facts'' introduced by North's lawyers on Thursday.
   The court statement, agreed to by both the government and
North's lawyers, said Bush got several North memoranda regarding
the secret operation to aid the Contras and also flew to Honduras
to tell that nation's president of expedited U.S. aid _ which was
aimed at inducing Honduras to help the Contras as well.
   In court Friday, the jury was read a ``Dear Ollie'' note that
Bush, then vice president, sent North at Thanksgiving in November
1985.
   ``One of the many things I have to be thankful for is the way in
which you have performed under fire in tough situations,'' said the
note, written on the back of a picture. ``Your dedication to the
hostage thing and Central America gives me cause for great pride.''
   On the witness stand, North testified that to fend off the
possibility of a broader congressional inquiry, he agreed to meet
with the House Intelligence Committee in the White House on August
1986.
   The 12 felony charges against him include obstructing Congress
in saying he didn't give military advice to the Nicaraguan Contras
and didn't raise money for them.
   ``Did you tell the truth at that meeting on Aug. 6, 1986?''
Sullivan asked.
   ``No,'' said North.
   ``Do you believe your conduct was unlawful?''
   ``No, I didn't think that it was unlawful. ...''
   ``I was put in a situation, having been raised to know what the
Ten Commandments are and knowing it would be wrong to do that, but
I went into the meeting not believing it would be illegal not to
tell Congress the truth. And that's why I didn't think the meeting
would be a good idea.''
   Did North tell all that to Adm. John Poindexter, who was the
president's national security adviser and North's boss?
   ``Yes.''
   ``And what was his position?''
   ``You can take care of it.''
   Poindexter, North said, was worried that a $100 million Contra
aid package which was about to be approved by Congress would be
imperiled if the administration refused to respond to Congress.
   ``I told him the heart of the (congressional) resolution of
inquiry was about all kinds of things that couldn't be addressed
and he and I both knew what they were,'' North testified, an
apparent reference to secret White House efforts to help the
Contras at a time when Congess had banned official U.S. aid.
   ``These things I had done, I was told could not, should not be
revealed.''
   North said he wanted the Reagan White House to invoke executive
privilege and refuse to answer any questions but was brushed aside
by his boss.
   ``You start howling about executive privilege and it's just
going to make it more difficult for everybody,'' North said
Poindexter told him.
   North also testified Friday that he complained that a key letter
sent to Capitol Hill by Robert McFarlane, Poindexter's predecessor
as national security adviser, was ``totally inconsistent'' with the
facts and ``all this was going to do was add fuel to the fire.''
North said, ``The answer he wanted to give was wrong; it was not
factual.''
   That letter forms the basis of one of the charges. Although it
was signed by McFarlane, prosecutors charge that North drafted it.
   North also contradicted McFarlane by testifying he altered
classified memos at McFarlane's direction.
   The memos showed ``what I had been doing at his direction in
Central America'' for the Contras, ``the delivery of arms, working
with General Secord and ... building the resistance,'' North told
the jury.
   Richard Secord, a former major general, was enlisted by North to
run arms to the Contras.
   McFarlane, however, had testified at the trial that North came
to him unsolicited with a few proposed changes, but that McFarlane
threw them away.
   North said he had balked at making the changes when McFarlane
first asked in 1985.
   But in November 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair was surfacing,
McFarlane, by then out of the NSC but having returned to help
reconstruct an account of the Iran arms initiative, again asked
North about the memos.
   ``I haven't taken care of it yet, but I will,'' North said he
told McFarlane. North's former secretary, Fawn Hall, testified
earlier that on instructions from North she altered the documents
by deleting numerous references to North's direct involvement with
the Contras.
   ``It never occurred to me it was unlawful,'' North said.
   On another point, North said there was wide dissemination to top
administration officials of sensitive intelligence about the
North-arranged delivery of missiles from Israel to Iran at the time
it took place. One of the charges against North is that he prepared
a chronology in November 1986 denying that anyone in the government
knew in 1985 that what was labeled ``oil drilling equipment''
actually consisted of missiles.
   North, who testified nearly five hours and will return on
Monday, also was asked by Sullivan about a $13,800 security fence
built around his house and paid for by Secord _ also the basis of a
criminal charge.
   Q. Did you intend to violate the law?
   A. No, I intended to pay for it.
   Q. Did you ever pay for it?
   A. No, I did not.

<HEAD>Man Confesses Murders To Priest; Bodies Found Stuffed in Refrigerator</HEAD>

   A man was charged with murder Friday
after he confessed to a priest that he killed his girlfriend and
daughter and stuffed their bodies in a refrigerator.
   The priest persuaded the man, Stephen A. Vrabel, 32, to turn
himself in after the two talked about 30 minutes in a confessional
Thursday.
   Vrabel, of Struthers, was ordered held on $2 million bond on two
counts of aggravated murder in the deaths of Susan Clemente, 29,
and 2{-year-old Lisa Clemente.
   Ms. Clemente's landlord, Michael E. Aey, discovered the bodies
Wednesday night when he went to the apartment where Vrabel and Ms.
Clemente lived to determine why they were behind in their rent.
   Her body was found in the refrigerator, wrapped in blankets,
sheets and a pillow tied around her with rope. The toddler's body
was bundled with two teddy bears, blankets and a pillow and stuffed
in the freezer compartment. Both had been shot in the head,
authorities said.
   Vrabel turned himself in Thursday in the Cleveland suburb of
Parma after hearing news reports that the bodies had been found and
confessing to the Rev. John Carlin, pastor of St. Charles Roman
Catholic Church. Carlin said he did not know Vrabel, who apparently
was driving through the neighborhood and spotted the church.
   ``He told me that he has killed his wife and daughter,'' Carlin
recounted in a telephone interview. ``Yes, I was scared.''
   Carlin, a priest for 13 years, called the confessional ``a movie
scenario.''
   Although confessions are considered confidential, Carlin said
Vrabel asked him to explain what happened to police and twice
released him from any obligation of secrecy _ once when they were
alone and the second time in front of three Parma police officers.
   Asked whether Vrabel mentioned a motive, Carlin said Friday,
``He told me nothing.'' He said he wouldn't comment on it even if
Vrabel had named a motive because he thinks that would be going
beyond Vrabel's intention when he agreed to have his confession
disclosed.
   Authorities believe the two were killed about March 3 and that
Vrabel spent about 2{ weeks in the apartment after their deaths,
left for a while and then returned, said police Detective Dean
Phillips.
   Vrabel did not enter a plea during his arraignment Friday. He
told Municipal Judge Robert Kalafut he had not worked in about six
months and had no income. He did not specify his occupation in
court and police did not know it.
   Kalafut appointed a lawyer for Vrabel, even though the suspect
said he didn't want to hire one or have one appointed for him.
   The judge said in an interview after the hearing that
investigators had found beer cans strewn about the apartment and a
type of gas mask he said was frequently used to inhale drugs.
   Police Capt. Joseph Bovenzi said authorities had no motive for
the killings. He said Vrabel told police he and his girlfriend had
not been arguing and that he had not been drinking or taking drugs
before the incident.
   A .22-caliber casing was found in the kitchen and two casings
and a slug were found in the front room, Phillips said. The
detective said police also found some rags that appeared to be
blood-stained.
   Police found a .22-caliber pistol in the car Vrabel drove to
police headquarters to surrender.
   A peliminary hearing is to be scheduled within 10 days. Vrabel
was being held in the Struthers jail Friday awaiting transfer to
the Mahoning County jail.

<HEAD>New Female Justice A Contrast To Bird</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The festive atmosphere that welcomed Joyce
Kennard to the California Supreme Court this week bore no
resemblance to the armed camp that greeted the court's only other
female justice, Rose Bird, a dozen years ago.
   Perhaps an even greater contrast can be found in Kennard's own
life.
   ``When I was living in a Quonset hut in the jungles of New
Guinea, I never thought I would make it to America, let alone
achieve what I have,'' the 47-year-old jurist told reporters after
her unanimous confirmation by the state's Commission on Judicial
Appointments.
   Kennard is an immigrant who arrived alone in Los Angeles at 20
with few resources. She's a straight-A student who went through
college, graduate school and law school in six years while working
at least 20 hours a week, a well-liked lawyer and judge who spent
only a year at each court level before reaching the top.
   As an infant, she was held in a Japanese internment camp in her
native Indonesia. Later, she and her mother lived in poverty in a
segregated village in New Guinea. She lost a leg to a
life-threatening infection at 16 in the Netherlands.
   A colleague at her last job, Appeals Court Justice Armand
Arabian, described her to the commission as ``this wondrous waif of
destiny.'' Asked if she had any weaknesses, he said, ``None known
to mortals.''
   Described by commentators as moderate to conservative, Kennard
does not alter the balance on the court, controlled 5-2 by
appointees of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian. The retiring
justice she succeeded, John Arguelles, was the most moderate of
Deukmejian's appointees.
   But she adds some diversity to a court that, in its 140 years,
has never had a justice of Asian descent and has had only one other
woman, who arrived in very different circumstances.
   Bird, named chief justice of a then-liberal court by Democratic
Gov. Jerry Brown in 1977, was a figure of controversy from the
start.
   A former public defender and Brown cabinet member with no
judicial experience, she came to the court determined to break up
the ``old-boy network'' that had long controlled administration and
hiring.
   She was met with resentment that she aggravated with a blunt
manner.
   The internal antagonisms eased somewhat over the years, but
Bird's external opposition grew. After narrowly surviving her
initial 1977 confirmation vote and her first statewide election in
1978, she was swept out of office in a 1986 campaign that focused
on the court's frequent reversals of death sentences.
   Two other liberals also were voted out, clearing the way for
Deukmejian to appoint a conservative majority to the court for the
first time in 30 years.
   The governor's first five appointees, all men, have swung the
court to the right, affirming death sentences about 70 percent of
the time and ruling in favor of insurers and employers in major
cases.
   Kennard, after four years as a deputy attorney general and six
as a research lawyer for an appeals court, has spent only three
years on the bench, one each at the municipal, superior and
appellate courts. Her written record amounts to 11 precedential
opinions, none in high-profile cases.
   But she got glowing testimonials from judicial colleagues and
lawyers who have appeared before her, and not one unfavorable
letter among 22 written to the commission. The State Bar assessed
her as ``well-qualified,'' its second-highest rating, apparently
because of her relative inexperience.
   In a brief session with reporters, Kennard described herself as
``sensitive to women's issues'' without elaborating.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday
announced cuts in the production of radioactive material for
nuclear weapons and ended a triumphant stop in Britain by inviting
Queen Elizabeth II to Moscow.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared Gorbachev's visit
``very successful, warm and friendly,'' but appeared unimpressed by
his concessions in the military field.
   She said the reductions in weapons-grade material ``will have no
effect in practice'' because ``they probably have quite a
sufficient stockpile of uranium.''
   In Washington, President Bush declined to comment on Gorbachev's
announcement, saying he had not had time to review its significance.
   A Pentagon official said the steps sketched by Gorbachev would
not have a major impact on Soviet capability to wage nuclear war.
   Although Gorbachev said arms control would stall unless the West
dropped plans to modernize its short-range nuclear missiles, Mrs.
Thatcher said her belief in a nuclear deterrent remains firm.
   Gorbachev insisted NATO had an advantage over the Warsaw Pact in
every area but tanks and said: ``In short, fears of the `Soviet
military threat' are groundless.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said East bloc forces still outnumber the Western
alliance 2-1.
   On a happier note, she said the queen gave ``a very definite
yes'' to the invitation extended during Gorbachev's lunch with
Elizabeth at Windsor Palace.
   No date was set for the visit, the first by a British monarch
since the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. Czar Nicholas II, who was
killed with his family by the Communists, was a cousin of the
queen's grandfather.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa spent 40 hours in Britain before
flying home and ending a six-day journey that also took them to
Ireland and Cuba.
   In London's Guildhall, the 1,000-year-old seat of city
government, Gorbachev rubbed shoulders with robed, bewigged
notables, marched behind the ceremonial macebearer and generally
seemed to enjoy his encounter with traditional British pageantry.
   Then, with Mrs. Thatcher seated before him, he delivered an
unusually brief 27-minute speech.
   He said the Soviet Union would halt production this year of
weapons-grade uranium and will shut down two more reactors that
produce plutonium for nuclear weapons by the end of next year.
   He called it ``another major step toward the complete cessation
of production of fissionable materials for use in weapons.''
   Later Friday, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov refused to say at a briefing which reactors would be
closed or give their locations.
   The Defense Department official, who refused to be further
identified, said, ``They (the Soviets) have weapons material coming
out of medium and short-range missiles. There has been as
assessment that they have stockpiles of weapons-grade materials.''
   If the Soviets shut down weapons reactors for several years,
they could restart them later when the military begins to run low
of weapons material.
   Gorbachev's statement did not provide adequate information for
Pentagon analysts to assess what impact the steps would have on
producing plutunium and tritium, the two materials needed for
modern thermonuclear weapons. Gorbachev did not mention tritium.
   It was one of several recent pronouncements by Gorbachev about
arms reduction. In December, he announced to the United Nations the
Soviet Union soon would begin reducing its standing army by 500,000
men and withdrawing troops and tanks from Europe and the Chinese
frontier.
   He praised Britain for unilaterally discarding chemical weapons
and said his country recently completed a facility, which British
experts would be invited to inspect, for destroying its own stocks.
   The hitherto secret Soviet defense budget will be published, he
said.
   Reviewing his plan to reform Soviet society, Gorbachev
acknowledged he initially had not realized the magnitude of the
task.
   In an apparent attempt to reassure Westerners who fear a
conservative backlash, he said: ``There is no turning back for
anyone. The people have firmly linked their destiny with
perestroika.''
   Gorbachev got a standing ovation and a resounding endorsement by
Mrs. Thatcher. ``We want you to succeed in your task'' she said in
her reply, and promised ``to help in practical ways, too, where our
help is sought and desired.''
   At a news conference later, the prime minister said she found
Gorbachev ``as dynamic, determined, stimulating and confident as
ever.''
   She has met him five times, three of them on visits he has made
to Britain.
   Recalling the first encounter, when he came to Britain in 1984
as No. 2 man in the Kremlin, she said: ``Some years ago I think I
said I thought Mr. Gorbachev was a man I could do business with. I
might just repeat today that I think that he is a person with whom
I look forward to doing more business.''
   Both sides acknowledged the talks were tough, argumentative and
yielded little practical progress, but the visit was a public
relations triumph for Gorbachev.
   After the speech he walked into admiring crowds for the second
time on the trip, and his televised appearance with the queen
guaranteed him new prestige with the royalty-loving British public.
   The 63-year-old monarch, in a bright pink cape and skirt, led
the Gorbachevs around Windsor Castle, a royal residence for 800
years, before lunch with her husband, Prince Philip; her son,
Edward; Mrs. Thatcher; and 33 other guests.
   Gorbachev later arrived home in Moscow, the official Tass news
agency reported Friday night without giving details.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday all
Palestinians will be able to run in elections he proposes for the
occupied lands, and any agreed solution ``will not be occupation.''
   His statements in an Israel television interview from Washington
seemed to be conciliatory deviation from earlier positions,
providing an opening for participation of PLO supporters in the
elections.
   Shamir proposes elections that would choose Palestinians to
negotiate an interim autonomy plan for the West Bank and Gaza,
where Palestinians have been in revolt against Israeli occupation
for 16 months. Talks on a permanent solution would begin after five
years.
   The prime minister consistently has ruled out a role in the
elections for the Palestine Liberation Organization, with which
Israel refuses to deal, and expressed hope of finding Palestinian
negotiators not affiliated with it.
   ``I believe the PLO ... does not want peace and therefore any
joint effort would be wasted and would not achiece the aim,'' he
said in the interview Friday.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat called Shamir's election proposal
``inappropriate, as usual'' and said the uprising will continue
``until victory.'' It was not clear from his comments whether he he
opposed the concept of elections in the territories.
   Shamir said he believed the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza would agree to elections even if the PLO did not
support them, and indicated PLO supporters would be able to run.
   ``Clearly, we think any Palestinian resident of Judea, Samaria
and Gaza'' can participate, he said, using biblical names for the
West Bank.
   ``If we reach an agreed solution, it would not be possible to
call it occupation. In any case, it will not be occupation.''
   Asked whether a member of the radical PLO faction Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine could participate, he avoided
a direct answer.
   ``Look, we have to work out all the details,'' he said. ``What I
brought are mostly principles, general pictures that must be filled
with lines, spots. This we will have to do in the near future. .. .
I think we have to start in the next few days.'' Shamir said.
   He appeared to back off from his earlier insistence that the
uprising end before elections were arranged, linking such a truce
instead to the actual time of voting.
   ``It's self-understood that when we approach the elections, when
we start this process, it can't be conducted and accompanied by
riots, disturbances and attacks,'' he said. ``I would not mention
conditions, but this is understood. ``If we have partners for
implementation of that program, it's certainly a realistic program.
It can be carried out and I think it serves the interests of both
sides. It greatly satisfies the aspirations of the Palestinian
Arabs without harming Israel's security and principles.''
   Of his talks with President Bush and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, Shamir said the Americans did not ask him to trade
territory for peace.
   ``They did not ask me to accept this formula,'' he said. ``They
know my views, and I adhere to the formula that says we're obliged
to hold talks in which the future of territories will be
determined.''
   Negotiations on final disposition of the territories Israel
captured in the 1967 war must be held ``without preconditions,
without determining what the solution might be,'' Shamir said.
``Only one thing: It must be accepted by both sides.''

   The Bush administration said Friday it is
searching the world for experts with oil-spill experience to help
in the Alaska oil cleanup, and also plans to recruit a work force
of young volunteers to help scrub petroleum-stained beaches.
   Those steps were outlined by U.S. officials after President Bush
first pledged military troops and equipment as part of an increase
in the government's role in repairing and containing damage from
the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``We're at full-scale,'' said Transportation Secretary Samuel S.
Skinner, who is overseeing the expanded federal effort. ``This is a
major civilian disaster. It is being treated as such by the
president.''
   Skinner said the youth corps might be mobilized later this
spring.to help clean up oil-fouled coastlines and wildlife on the
dozens of islands affected by the 10.1 million gallons of crude oil
that spilled from the tanker Exxon Valdez.
   Meanwhile, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said his department
is preparing a memorandum of understanding with Exxon for an
initial payment by the giant oil company at least $10 million to
cover the costs of assessing long-term environmental damages and to
plan for their mitigation.
   Lujan said the final total for cleanup and environmental
recovery is likely to be well in excess of the $100 million talked
about several days ago. ``The area that's covered keeps growing and
growing,'' said Lujan in an interview.
   ``I don't think we'll be through with all this business of
cleanup in anything less than a year,'' he warned.
   ``Right now we can't really tell you the extent of the damage to
the wildlife. We know that it's extensive, but as time goes on we
think it's going to be disastrous.'' said Lujan.
   The head of the Environomental Protection Agency, William
Reilly, said that ``one of my first jobs is going to be to bring to
bear on this problem a group of scientists.''
   ``We are looking around the world for the very best scientific
resources that are available _ people who have dealt with
significant oil spills before,'' Reilly said.
   Reilly said it is still too early to assess the full damage from
the oil spill. He predicted the EPA's study of the damage could
itself take as long as three years to complete.
   Other elements of the administration's Alaska relief plan
include:
   _ A yet-to-be determined number of troops will be sent to Alaska
to help in the cleanup. A preliminary Pentagon assessment team to
determine the scope of the work headed for Valdez on Friday.
   _ The Defense Department will send amphibious ships into remote
reaches of Prince William Sound to house and feed those involved in
the cleanup; the Valdez airport will be modernized so that flights
can land there around the clock.
   _ Exxon was urged by the White House to increase the number of
its employees working on the cleanup, and was asked to set up a
procedure for providing immediate payments to those suffering
damage from the spill, pending the resolution of permanent claims.
   _ The administration announced Bush would soon submit oil-spill
liability legislation to Congress, and he also called on the Senate
to give prompt attention to ratifying several pending international
oil-spill agreements.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said nearly all branches of the
military will be involved in the massive cleanup.
   ``We've got the capacity, I think, to go in and help solve that
problem,'' he said. He compared the decision to send troops to
Alaska to the use of military forces last year in fighting forest
fires in Yellowstone National Park.
   At the Pentagon, Defense Department officials said they had
postponed a decision on how many servicemen might be sent to Alaska
until the special assessment team reports back with a
recommendation.
   The military said in a prepared statement that the team was made
up of engineering, environmental, medical and logistics specialists.
   The Pentagon also said it was establishing an Alaska Oil Spill
Joint Task Force, to be headed by Lt. Gen. Thomas G. McInerney of
the Air Force, the commanding general of the Alaskan Air Command.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev followed in the
footsteps of the czars and came to Queen Elizabeth II's castle on
Friday, then asked the question Britons have been speculating about
for months.
   He asked the monarch if she would come to Moscow. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said the queen gave ``a very definite yes.''
   Winding up his two-day visit, the Soviet leader sampled
old-fashioned British pageantry _ first in the oak-paneled splendor
of the Guildhall, for 800 years the seat of London city government,
then in majestic Windsor Castle overlooking the River Thames.
   Elizabeth will be the first British monarch to visit the Soviet
Union since the revolution that ousted the czars and brought the
communists to power.
   The invitation has great implications because of the close
kinship of the Russian and British royal families. Czar Nicholas
II, a cousin of the queen's grandfather, was murdered with his
family in 1918, ending the Romanov dynasty.
   The queen's reaction sounded somewhat guarded. A Buckingham
Palace statement said: ``Thanking Mr. Gorbachev, Her Majesty
explained that the program for her visits were fixed a number of
years in advance. She hoped it would be possible to visit the
Soviet Union in due course.''
   But Mrs. Thatcher, whose government has the final word on
approving or rejecting a visit, said: ``It's a very definite yes.''
She added the queen was ``very positive, very glad, very happy''
about the invitation.
   In November, a month before Gorbachev originally was scheduled
to visit Britain, reports of a Soviet prospective invitation to the
queen started circulating and Mrs. Thatcher let it be known she
thought it was too soon to give such a resounding stamp of approval
to the Soviet leader's reform plans.
   At a news conference in London Friday night, Soviet officials
were asked whether the palace or British government had insisted
the Soviets apologize for the treatment of the Russian royal family
before the queen accepted the invitation.
   Yevgeny Primakov of the Soviet Institute of World Economic and
International Politics said there were ``no preconditions on either
side.''
   He said Soviets are reasessing their history but added: ``This
is not the point. This is an invitation to a head of state of a
country with which we are trying to find points of convergence.''
   Gorbachev was driven to Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London
_ the first Soviet leader since 1967 to visit the queen.
   In drizzling rain, he took the Royal Salute from the Guard of
Honor mounted by the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards. The captain
then reported to Gorbachev in Russian and the Soviet leader,
carrying his hat in his hand, reviewed the troops clad in gray
greatcoats and bearskin hats.
   The queen, wearing a pink cape and matching skirt, then took
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, on a quick tour of the palace _ past
relics from the Crusades, medieval knights on horseback, King Henry
VIII's suit of armor, and a painting of the Russian Emperor
Alexander I. Gorbachev beamed in recognition.
   The party made a brief detour to enable Gorbachev to look at a
malachite vase given to Queen Victoria by Czar Nicholas I.
   Nicholas I was the first of the czarist cousins to come to
Windsor, spending three days in June 1844 as Victoria's guest.
Alexander II, the future Alexander III, and the future Nicholas II,
were also entertained at Windsor by the British royals.
   Buckingham Palace said Gorbachev invited the queen to visit the
Soviet Union over a lunch of smoked salmon, pastry filled with
layers of beef, duck puree and artichoke and avocado salad, and
three wines.
   The 34 guests included Mrs. Thatcher and her husband, Denis, and
the queen's youngest son, Prince Edward, who will be visiting
Moscow next week with the National Youth Theater.
   Lord St. John of Fawsley, a constitutional expert, said the
invitation ``will cement the very warm relationship between
ourselves and the Soviet Union. I think it will put an end to all
tensions that could have come from the memories of the
assassination of the czar and I think the queen will have a very
ecstatic reception.''
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's peerage,
said the queen should insist that the Soviets disclose where Czar
Nicolas II and his family are buried, and that she be allowed to
pay her respects.
   ``The fact that the queen could see the graves of her relations,
and repair the damage done after the Russian Revolution in a
Christian and religious way, would perhaps bring these countries
closer together than anyone ever thought possible,'' he said.

<HEAD>CBS To Do Miniseries On Hedda Nussbaum's Life Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS will create a four-hour miniseries based on
the life of Hedda Nussbaum, who testified against former lover Joel
Steinberg when he was tried for the death of their foster daughter,
a spokeswoman said Friday.
   Writing and casting have not begun, but CBS, which competed with
ABC and NBC for exclusive rights to the story, plans to broadcast
the miniseries sometime next season, said Ann Morfogen, vice
president of media relations.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, a former children's book editor, has pledged
her full cooperation, including the diaries she began writing at
age 15, but will not have editorial control of the project.
   The series will likely concentrate on Ms. Nussbaum's
relationship with Steinberg, who was convicted of first-degree
manslaughter in the fatal 1987 beating of 6-year-old Lisa, the
couple's illegally adopted daughter.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred lawyer, was sentenced to
8{-to-25-years in prison two weeks ago and is appealing his
conviction.
   Ms. Nussbaum, a patient at a psychiatric center, recounted years
of physical and psychological torture during her testimony.
   Andrew Lack, executive producer of CBS News' ``West 57th,''
arranged the deal with Ms. Nussbaum's lawyer, Barry Scheck.
   A network official who would not be quoted by name said Ms.
Nussbaum will receive ``well under $100,000.'' Lack said the money
will go toward her ``staggering'' medical bills.
   Steinberg lawyer Felix Gilroy told the Daily News: ``The fact
that the production exists and that it came out so quickly after
the sentencing just demonstrates that there was a monetary motive
behind her whole fabrication. If she told the truth, it wouldn't be
a story.''
   Nussbaum has refused to give interviews since she was arrested
with Steinberg in Lisa's death. Charges against her were dropped.

   A sharp earthquake jolted Southern
California from downtown Los Angeles to San Diego on Friday,
causing minor injuries and damage in Orange County, where the
shaking was strongest.
   Mirrors, windows and wine bottles smashed to floors at Fashion
Island Shopping Center, the largest outdoor mall in Orange County,
said Anita Hilyer, administrative director. She said shoppers
scrambled when the 4.6-magnitude temblor hit.
   ``Some of them panicked and got in their cars and tried to get
out of here,'' she said. ``Some went to the center of the mall to
wait and see and what would happen next.''
   Several people were injured by broken glass at RJ's The Rib
Joint restaurant in affluent Newport Beach, a city 40 miles
southeast of Los Angeles, said police spokesman Bob Oakley.
   ``We felt a real slight rolling motion, then a real abrupt
shake. It felt as if something crashed into the building, it was
that sharp,'' Oakley said. ``A lot of alarms are going off in the
city. We had to bring in extra personnel in the communications
center to handle hundreds of calls.''
   The earthquake at 1:07 p.m. measured 4.6 on the Richter scale
and was centered directly under Newport Beach, according to the
U.S. Geological Survey and the California Institute of Technology
in Pasadena.
   USGS spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson in Menlo Park said the epicenter
was very near that of the March 10, 1933, Long Beach earthquake,
which measured 6.3 on the Richter scale, killed 115 people and
spurred reform of California's school construction laws.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude; thus a 7.5 reading reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than a 6.5 reading.
   At the San Onofre nuclear power facility in northern San Diego
County, the quake prompted officials to declare an ``unusual
event,'' the lowest-level emergency declaration, said Southern
California Edison spokeswoman Becky Sordelet. However, the one
nuclear reactor that was operating was not shut down.
   Nancy Aldon of Newport Beach said the quake toppled books,
dishes and videotapes off shelves in her home.
   ``The whole building shook, a kind of rolling shake,'' said
Kimberly Stewart, 25, who works in a law office in a 15-floor
office building in Huntington Beach, which is adjacent to Newport
Beach.
   ``It startled everyone,'' she said. ``It was slight, then got
stronger and slight again. We are on the 11th floor so I'm sure it
seemed a lot stronger.''
   ``It was like being stopped at a stop sign and being run into,''
a resident of Irvine in Orange County told KNX-AM radio.
   At a California Newspaper Publishers Association seminar and
luncheon at the Grand Hotel, near Disneyland in Anaheim, those in
attendance felt a jolt and then shaking that gradually gathered
strength. Chandeliers began to dance and glasses rattled on tables.
   Andrea Schulte, a 23-year-old student who was at the meeting,
said the quake started with ``very little noise. Everybody stayed
calm. Nobody moved except one person because she was under a
chandelier. The building was moving and the chandeliers were
swaying.''
   But in Newport Beach, resident Joseph Cleary said, ``It was a
large jolt, a big jump.''
   In Long Beach, 22 miles northwest of the epicenter, the quake
was felt in high rise apartments, and employees at Los Angeles City
Hall and downtown Los Angeles courts also felt the temblor.
   At a hearing in Superior Court in downtown Los Angeles, Judge
Bruce Geernaert was in the midst of delivering comments on the fear
of death suffered by Rock Hudson's lover, Marc Christian. Then the
room began to sway.
   ``Is it my decision or are we shaking?'' asked the judge.
   As the swaying continued, a voice from the back of the room
called out, ``This is a fear of death, your honor,'' and everyone
laughed.
   The judge noted for the record, ``There has been and maybe still
is a bit of an earthquake in progress,'' but he continued with the
hearing.
   A quake at 3.5 on the Richter scale quake can cause slight
damage in its immediate area; a 4 can cause moderate damage; and a
5 considerable damage. A 7 is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   The crew for the first space shuttle
planetary mission completed a successful practice countdown Friday
while launch pad workers prepared for final checks of the
spacecraft's engines and cargo.
   Shuttle technicians planned to spend the weekend hooking up
turbopumps in Atlantis' three main engines.
   ``We should be all buttoned up and ready to check the engines
for flight by Monday,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   NASA wants Atlantis to lift off on April 28 but concedes the
schedule is tight. Shuttle managers are to meet April 14 to set a
firm launch date.
   A test of the computer and communications link between NASA's
ground control station and the shuttle's $378 million cargo, the
Magellan Venus probe and its booster rocket, was scheduled for
Saturday.
   After a 466-day trip, Magellan will orbit Venus with a
high-powered radar pointed at the planet's surface. Over 243 days,
the radar is to send back the sharpest images yet of Earth's
nearest solar system neighbor.
   The five astronauts assigned to the 29th shuttle flight spent
the final two hours of the dress rehearsal inside the craft's cabin
and wearing bulky space suits.
   The countdown test, which began Thursday, duplicated much of the
actual count. The main differences were that the fuel tank wasn't
loaded, some procedures were shortened and technical problems were
built in to give launch controllers a workout.
   ``Everything appears to have gone as planned,'' said NASA
spokesman Hugh Harris. ``The exercise is designed to allow the
launch team, the crew and the payload team to take a look at
exactly what's going to happen on launch day.''

   Proclaiming it ``the first contact of its kind
since 1917,'' Soviet television broadcast Friday's meeting between
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Queen Elizabeth II with relish
and lingering detail.
   After a leisurely shot of Gorbachev's cortege gliding up the
lush drive to Windsor Castle, the nightly news program ``Vremya''
touted the ``symbolic significance'' of the British monarch's
hospitality to the Communist leader.
   The narrator recalled that close relations between Russian and
British nobility ended in 1917 ``when the Romanovs were deprived of
power.''
   Czar Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, and he and his entire
family were shot by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Nicholas was a cousin
of the queen's grandfather.
   As the dignitaries stood at attention and the Soviet national
anthem was played, Soviet TV noted that ``never before has the
anthem of the Soviet Union been sounded here,'' at Windsor Castle.
   The report praised the castle's furnishings and art as
``invaluable collections.''
   Gorbachev invited the queen to visit Moscow, and she accepted in
principle but said her schedule was fixed years in advance.
   Dissidents contended she should reject the invitation because of
continuing Soviet human rights violations.
   Andrei Mironov, a Moscow dissident and former political
prisoner, cited the case of a dissident journalist in Sverdlovsk
who is now on trial.
   Mironov spoke as he and four others gave a protest letter to the
British Embassy about the trial of Sergei Kuznetsov. The dissidents
wanted the embassy to have Britain's prime minister, Margaret
Thatcher, raise the case in her talks with Gorbachev.
   Soviet television also covered Gorbachev's meeting with Mrs.
Thatcher extensively.
   It broadcast live on Friday the speeches by Gorbachev and Mrs.
Thatcher at London's Guildhall.

<HEAD>Bush Releasing Money to Keep MX Development Alive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush told Congress Friday he was
releasing a $120 million installment to keep the MX missile program
alive but still has not made up his mind on how to modernize the
nation's land-based nuclear missiles.
   He said the money had to be earmarked to ``prevent program
disruption'' for the 10-warhead MX.
   The administration is undertaking a review of what mix of
next-generation missiles to endorse.
   The MX missiles would be deployed in rail cars. A rival plan is
to switch to single-warhead Midgetman missiles. Or there could be
some mix of the two intercontinental ballistic missile systems.
   Bush was initially to tell Congress by mid-February which system
he had selected. However, that deadline was missed and the
selection _ which has been debated for the past ten years _
postponed while the review of U.S. strategic policy proceeded.
   ``I am committed to an open and full review of the ICBM
modernization issue. I am confident the review will provide the
basis for development of consensus on ICBM modernization,'' Bush
said in a letter to the chairmen of the Senate and House committees
on appropriations and armed services.
   Bush said permitting $120 million to be spent on the MX program
would ensure its viability while not endangering the Midgetman
program, ``which can proceed without additional funds until the
national security strategy review and amendments to the fiscal year
1990-91 budget are completed.''
   ``This obligation of additional funds for (the MX) must occur in
order to prevent program disruption, substantial cost increases or
significant schedule delays,'' Bush said.
   Bush said during last year's presidential campaign, ``The real
choice now is to find a possible mix between the two.''
   A congressional study last year said that it would cost $13.8
billion to build 50 rail-based MX missiles, and about three times
as much for the equivalent 500 Midgetman missiles.
   MX proponents cite this cost advantage, while opponents argue
that the 10-warhead MX would be more vulnerable to surprise attacks.

<HEAD>WHO Survey Shows Soviet Life Expectancy Lowest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Life expectancy in the world's industrialized
countries is highest in Japan and lowest in the Soviet Union and
Hungary, according to the first-ever survey on mortality in all
developed countries.
   The World Health Organization, which published the survey Friday
in its weekly Epidemiological Record, said official statistics
supplied by the Soviet Union have now ``made it possible to prepare
an overall assessment'' of health conditions in the 33 countries.
   The population of the countries totals about 1.2 billion, about
one fourth of the world total.
   According to the survey, the chances of dying from cancer in the
developed nations are 1 in 6, and almost 500,000 annual deaths
below age 65 are related to cigarette smoking.
   The average life expectancy in the developed countries is now
73.7 years. The Japanese rate is 79.1 years, or almost a decade
longer than the Soviet rate of 69.7 years.
   All Western countries listed life expectancies above the
average. They included Switzerland at 77.6 years; Sweden, 77.1;
Spain, 76.6; Canada, and the Netherlands, 76.5; Australia and
Norway, 76.4; France 75.9; West Germany, 75.8; Italy, 75.5; the
United States, 75.0, and Belgium, 74.6.
   Life expectancy in all East European countries was below the
average; East Germany ranked highest at 73.2 years.
   Heart disease, cancer, and stroke are the leading causes of
death in the developed countries, according to the survey. About 1
in 3 people will die from heart disease, 1 in 6 from cancer and 1
in 7 from stroke.
   The survey cited ``the very substantial premature mortality
which arises due to cigarette smoking and other detrimental health
behaviors.''
   About 1.5 million of the 11 million deaths recorded each year in
the 33 countries are related to smoking, according to the survey.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Legislation to Scrap Guarantee on Dock Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Friday moved to abolish labor
regulations that guarantee dockworkers' jobs for life, prompting
strikes by thousands of employees at five big British ports,
including Liverpool and Tilbury.
   One union leader warned abolition of 42-year-old National Dock
Labor Scheme may provoke a nationwide strike.
   The leftist-led Transport and General Workers' Union, which
called the walkout, urged its members to return to work ahead of a
meeting scheduled Monday to discuss whether to hold a ballot on an
official strike.
   In the House of Commons, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
government put forward legislation to scrap the regulations by
July. They apply to 9,400 dockworkers at 46 ports handling 70
percent of Britain's foreign trade.
   The government plans to pay compensation of up to $59,500 to
each of the 1,000 dockworkers expected to lose their jobs when the
system is abolished.
   The legislation, welcomed by employers, is certain to be passed
because of Mrs. Thatcher's big majority in the Commons.
   On Thursday, Employment Secretary Norman Fowler called the dock
labor regulations an ``anachronism'' amid jeers from opposition
Labor Party legislators.
   ``As long as the scheme continues to operate, it will remain the
biggest obstacle to a modern and efficient ports industry,'' said
Fowler.
   More than 2,200 dockworkers at Liverpool, in northwestern
England, and the east coast port of Tilbury, two of Britain's
biggest ports, walked out after mass meetings Friday. Another
English port, Southampton, was at a standstill, and smaller
walkouts disrupted Bristol the Scottish port of Glasgow.
   The Labor Party accused the government of ``an act of wilful
sabotage.''
   The dock labor regulations, introduced by a Labor government,
stipulate that manning levels can be cut only when workers quit
voluntarily. If a port goes out of business, dockworkers covered by
the system must be hired at another port.
   The regulations were introduced to stop harsh employment
conditions, when dockers were hired on a day-to-day basis, competed
with each other for work, and had no job benefits. But critics say
abuses have grown and some dockworkers get paid not to work.
   John Connally, docks' officer at the Transport and General
Workers' Union, said a strike could spread.
   ``The docks membership of the union will undoubtedly react
strongly. ... and will call for the implementation of the
long-standing policy (to call a national strike) to oppose any
attempt to end the scheme,'' he said.
   Britain's other, newer 29 main ports employing another 4,000
dockworkers are not covered by the scheme. But Connally said he
believed they would also walk off the job if a national strike was
called.
   National docks strikes in 1972 and 1975 hit large parts of the
British economy.

<HEAD>Half Of U.S. Homicides May Be Linked To Television Viewing, Study
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homicide rates doubled in the United States and
Canada within 20 years of the spread of television, says a
psychiatrist's seven-year statistical study which he contends shows
a link between video and violence.
   Other experts cautioned Friday, however, that while Dr. Brandon
Centerwall's study may have merit, blaming television for the rise
in homicide rates is too simplistic.
   Centerwall's study, published in the April issue of the American
Journal of Epidemiology, is billed as the first to look at the
statistical relationships between exposure to television and acts
of violence for the entire country.
   Centerwall's study also suggests that as many as half of other
violent crimes _ including rapes and assaults _ are related to
exposure to television.
   ``Television is a factor in approximately 10,000 homicides each
year in the United States,'' said Centerwall, a member of the
psychiatry faculty at the University of Washington School of
Medicine.
   ``While television clearly is not the sole cause of violence in
our society, and there are many other contributing factors,
hypothetically if television did not exist there would be 10,000
fewer homicides a year.''
   To arrive at this conclusion, Centerwall studied the white
population of South Africa, where television was not introduced
until 1975. Using statistics from 1945 to 1974, he compared
homicide rates among South African whites to the rates among U.S.
whites and the entire Canadian population.
   He found that homicides remained roughly flat in South Africa
before television was introduced. In the United States and Canada,
however, homicide rates doubled within 20 years after the
widespread introduction of television.
   Centerwall also said the homicide rate among South African
whites in 1983 _ the last year for which statistics were available
_ was 56 percent higher than in 1974, indicating a trend similar to
what occurred in the United States after the introduction of
television.
   Ronald Kessler, a professor of sociology at the University of
Michigan, said Friday that the major problem with Centerwall's
study is that when television arrives in a society, many other
things come with it.
   ``It's hard to imagine, when you look at what's been happening
in South Africa, that the main change between the 1950s and 1970s
has been television,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Dr. Michael Rothenberg, professor emeritus of psychiatry,
behavioral sciences and pediatrics at the University of Washington,
said he believed Centerwall's study ``should be taken very, very
seriously.''
   Rothenberg, co-author of the current edition of ``Dr. Spock's
Baby and Child Care,'' added that people who commit homicide do so
for many different reasons, and Centerwall's figures struck him as
high.
   ``He compared entire populations, so the statistical study is
more accurate,'' Rothenberg said. ``But precisely because they are
entire populations, there are multiple variables.''
   Centerwall said regions of the United States that had widespread
television before the rest of the country also saw earlier
increases in homicide rates.
   ``There is a strong relationship between when a region acquired
television and when its homicide rates went up,'' he said.
   South Africa was an appropriate choice for the study because it
is a prosperous, industrialized Western country similar in many
respects to the United States, Centerwall said. He limited his
study to South African whites because South African blacks and
other minorities live under very different conditions.
   Centerwall's study did not look at which aspects of television
presumably lead to violent behavior. He said other variables, such
as the amount of time spent watching TV, the kinds of programs
watched, and what else the television viewer does in a day, still
need to be studied.

   A heat wave continued Friday over the Southwest, with
temperatures rising past 100, but in the East snow fell at higher
elevations of the southern Appalachians.
   The mercury hit a record 100 degrees in downtown Los Angeles at
1 p.m. Downtown had a record-tying 100 Tuesday and record highs of
105 Wednesday and 106 Thursday.
   Other early afternoon readings in southern California included
108 in Palm Springs, 100 in Burbank, and 93 in San Diego. An
estimated 60,000 people crowded Santa Monica Beach, lifeguards said.
   The National Weather Service predicted the beginning of a
cooling trend Saturday with the dissipation of the Santa Ana
weather condition, which began with warm wind last weekend.
   Snow fell at midday over the higher elevations of southern West
Virginia, western Virginia and western North Carolina.
   Early in the day, up to 4 inches of snow fell in the mountains
of northeastern Georgia, and schools in three counties were closed
because of slippery roads.
   Rain fell across much of the rest of Virginia, West Virginia and
North Carolina, and across eastern Tennessee, eastern South
Carolina, the Georgia coast, and northeastern Florida.
   The heaviest rainfall during the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was
0.83 of an inch at Cape Hatteras, N.C.
   Snow was scattered over western sections of Pennsylvania and New
York state, and across northwestern Lower Michigan.
   Snow also extended over northern and central North Dakota and
northwestern Minnesota, changing to rain or rain mixed with snow
across southwestern North Dakota and the eastern half of South
Dakota. Rain reached from eastern Nebraska and western Iowa into
northwestern Missouri.
   In northeastern North Dakota, up to 3 inches of snow fell during
the morning over Cavalier and Pembina counties. In adjacent
northwestern Minnesota, 4 inches fell at Badger and Roseau and 6
inches fell at Hallock.
   Also along the North Dakota-Minnesota border, ice jams and rapid
snow melt continued to swell the Red River. It was forecast to
crest at Fargo, N.D., at almost 20 feet above flood stage during
the weekend.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 24
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 109 at Palm Springs, Calif. Friday's
low for the Lower 48 states was 13 degrees at International Falls,
Minn.
   For Saturday, snow, some mixed with rain, was forecast over
northern Maine, Upper Michigan, northern Lower Michigan and
Wisconsin. Morning snow changing to rain was forecast over Montana
and northern Wyoming. Rain was forecast from central Maine across
inland sections of the Carolinas, northern Georgia, northern
Alabama, northern Mississippi, the Tennessee Valley, the Ohio
Valley and the remainder of the Great Lakes.
   Highs in the 30s and 40s were predicted from New England and New
Jersey across Montana and Wyoming; in the 50s and 60s from the
central Atlantic Coast across the Ohio Valley, the Tennessee
Valley, Missouri, the central Plains, the central Rockies and
Washington state; in the 90s from southwestern Texas across the
southern half of California; near 110 over the desert Southwest;
and generally in the 70s and 80s over the remainder of the nation.

   The injured were taken to a hospital in Assam's Golaghat
district, it said.
   The tribals, who filtered in from Nagaland, also set fire to
more than 100 houses in Lachitgaon and two other villages,
ransacked and raided granaries, and carried away or killed hundreds
of cattle and other valuables, Press Trust of India said.
   PTI said police recovered leaflets in which the National
Socialist Council of Nagaland claimed responsibility.
   The Council, composed of tribal Nagas, began a violent campaign
in the 1960s seeking independence for Nagaland from India and
affiliations with China, which it borders, news reports said.
   Nagaland is in India's extreme northeast, about 1,375 miles east
of New Delhi. Most of its 775,000 people belong to tribes, the
largest of which are the Angamis and Aos.
   Most tribals converted to Christianity, now the state's main
religion, at the turn of the century.

   Journalist Marjorie Nichols walked out of a
building on Parliament Hill on Friday afternoon and heard to her
astonishment a member of Parliament shouting at her, ``Look out,
you're in the line of fire!''
   Moments before, she had gazed out from the Center Block and saw
people leaving a bus.
   ``Sort of walking, running in a crouched position,'' she told
reporters later. ``People were escorting them in a crouched
position like you see in war movies.''
   When she walked out of the building, she saw men lying prone on
the ground, men in street clothes with guns drawn.
   And then Bill Blaikie, a burly member of Parliament from
Winnipeg, was yelling at her to get out of there before she was hit
by a bullet.
   It was no movie.
   A gunman had hostages in a bus on the Parliament Hill lawn and
shots already had been fired.
   Nicholas, a columnist for the Ottawa Citizen, and the
politicians, staff and visitors in the gothic Parliament Buildings
were in a combat zone.
   ``It was one of those things where somebody shouts, `There have
been shots!' and I thought, `My God, I heard that.'''
   Her reaction was common among the people working in the
Parliament Buildings who were soon told of the hostage-taking
outside.
   Many had taken no notice of the shots they heard.
   ``I heard a gunshot and that made me look out,'' said a
receptionist in the office of Sen. Stanley Haidasz. ``You know, you
hear all the noise all the time and you don't pay much attention.
But it sounded peculiar.''
   The receptionist refused to give her name.
   Police hurried visitors and some employees out of the building.
They told many employees not to leave the Parliament Buildings and
to stay away from windows as the area was being cordoned off.
   ``One of our security men just came in and asked us to leave and
he said: `Because he has fired another shot. We've got to get out
of here,''' said Terry Kealey, a staff member in Grains Minister
Charlie Mayer's office, in a phone interview.
   About two hours later, the employees were ushered out by
security guards.
   Those in the main building were led through a tunnel to a nearby
building, then escorted out amid the hundreds of spectators who had
gathered on nearby sidewalks.
   Parliament members sitting in the Commons were informed by the
sergeant-at-arms about the gunman. They left when the building was
cleared.
   Blaikie, a New Democrat member of Parliament, said he was
standing on the front step of the Parliament Buildings waiting for
a cab when he noticed a police cruiser drive across the lawn.
   Moments later, officers motioned to people to get down, Blaikie
said, and he ``decided maybe it was time to get out of there.''

   Rebels fired six rockets Friday
at a police station in northern San Salvador, but five missed their
mark and exploded among modest homes in the Zacamil working-class
district.
   One child was killed and five other children and a woman were
wounded.
   The cinder-block home of Vicente Castillo was ripped apart, his
11-year-old daughter killed and his wife and three other children
wounded.
   But Castillo, 63, could not see the carnage. He is blind.
   He sat on a straight-backed chair on the patio staring ahead.
Beside him was the blanket-covered body of his daughter Carina.
   Castillo held between his knees a small small white bucket and
friends dropped coins into the container to help pay for Carina's
funeral. Near him was the basketball-sized hole where the anti-tank
rocket hit.
   Two children at a nearby house also were wounded.
   One rocket came near the target. It hit a brick guardhouse on
the grounds of a national police station, inflicting minor damage
but no casualties, according to Lt. Rafael Tobar.
   Castillo said, ``It (the rocket) must have been fired at the
station, but it came to fall on us. I heard the detonation and the
cries.''
   His wife, Virginia, daughters Sandra, 18, and Irma, 20, were
struck by shrapnel and a neighbor said they ran down the dirt path
leading from their house, crying in pain and terror. ``They were
covered with blood,'' the neighbor said. They were picked up by a
Red Cross ambulance.
   Castillo's youngest child Jose was slightly wounded.
   Carina's death became another statistic in the list of the
estimated 70,000 people killed in nine years of civil war. Most of
the victims were civilians.
   In February, the leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed
government declared a halt to the use in urban centers of mortars
mounted on pickup trucks. The devices killed some civilians and
wounded dozens while doing only slight damage to military tartets.
   The guerrillas, who called the devices ``mobile artillery
platforms,'' said they would no longer use them ``because of harm
caused to the civilian population.'' They called on the armed
forces to reciprocate by halting the use of long-range artillery
and air raids on suspected rebel positions that killed thousands of
civilians. The military ignored the proposal.
   The rockets used Friday are shoulder-fired from disposable tubes.

   An Exxon tanker carrying 13 million gallons
of petroleum products ran aground Friday near the mouth of the
Mississippi River, but the hull was not damaged and none of the
cargo spilled, the Coast Guard said.
   The 617-foot Exxon Wilmington was freed after seven hours and
resumed its journey to New Jersey, officials said.
   ``Thank goodness for something called Mississippi mud,'' said
John Reidy, a spokesman for Exxon.
   The ship ran aground at 8:30 a.m. about three miles downstream
from a Russian grain freighter that has been stuck in the channel
for 18 days, said Coast Guard Chief Dan Dewell.
   ``Some build up and settlement may have occurred in that area as
a result of changes in the current where the grain ship is,'' Reidy
said.
   Dewell said the tanker hit soft mud, unlike the Russian
freighter which is hard aground and was being unloaded so that it
can be floated free.
   The Exxon ship ran aground in the same place that a second
freighter was mired last week, Dewell said.
   ``This sort of thing happens ... seven to eight times a year,
especially in the early springtime,'' he said.
   Four tugs and a barge helped free the Wilmington, which had
taken on 8 million gallons of jet fuel and other cargo at the Exxon
refinery at Baton Rouge, Reidy said. Also aboard were about 5
million gallons of gasoline, lubricants and paraffin.
   ``With that kind of cargo, it's always a concern,'' Reidy said.
   Two weeks ago, an Exxon tanker ran aground on a reef on the
southern coast of Alaska, spilling more than 10.1 million gallons
of crude oil. It was the largest oil spill in North American
history.

<HEAD>Additional Recruit Donations To Takeshita Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television network Friday reported the discovery
of still more past donations to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita by
the company at the center of a stock-profiteering scandal that has
hurt his government.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. said Recruit Co. donated about
$190,000 to Takeshita's political support groups in 1986.
   The report came one day after Takeshita confirmed that Recruit
contributed a total of about $380,000 at two of his fund-raising
parties in May 1987.
   Asked about the reported 1986 donations, Takeshita said: ``I
have not heard the full content of the report. We have to review
all facts first.''
   Under Japanese law, a company of Recruit's size can give a
maximum total of about $114,000 in political donations each year.
   Critics have questioned Takeshita's ability, afte receiving
large contributions from Recruit, to carry out his promised
political reforms and oversee a full investigation of the stock
scandal.
   Opposition party leaders on Friday renewed their demands that
Takeshita resign. He has rejected the calls and instead has vowed
to make reforms that will restore public trust in politics.
   ``How can you trust the man to prosecute Recruit when he owes
the company so much?'' asked Yuichi Ichikawa, a senior official of
Komeito, the Clean Government Party.
   Shun Ohide, an official of the largest opposition group, the
Japan Socialist Party, said: ``I am speechless now. I don't think
he has any other choice but to step down after all these
disclosures.''
   Leaders of four opposition parties met in Kyoto to discuss
forming a coalition government that they hope would take over the
administration if Takeshita stepped down. It was the first meeting
in three years among leaders of the Socialist, Komeito, Democratic
Socialist and United Social Democratic parties.
   About 80 members of Takeshita's governing Liberal Democratic
Party demanded this week that government and party leaders act
immediately to restore public trust in the party.
   Some also demanded the resignations of all politicians who
received money or cut-rate stock shares from Recruit. At least 25
politicians, including Takeshita and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, have been implicated.
   Recruit, an information services conglomerate, sold
bargain-price unlisted shares in a subsidiary to about 150
influential politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, who profited
handsomely after public trading in the shares began.
   Japan's most powerful business group said Friday that the
scandal pointed up the need for businesses to curb gift-giving and
donations to politicians and to establish ethics standards.
   The Japan Federation of Economic Organizations also said the
case threatened to ``damage the free enterprise economy.''
   Prosecutors have arrested 14 public officials and business
leaders in the Recruit case on bribery and securities law violation
charges. No politicians have been arrested, but prosecutors
reportedly have been questioning politicians and their aides.
   Three Cabinet ministers have resigned over the scandal, and
support for Takeshita in recent public opinion polls has fallen as
low as 9 percent.
   Takeshita does not have to call elections until next year for
the powerful lower house of parliament, in which his Liberal
Democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats. But half of the 256 seats in
the upper house will be up for election this summer.

   Reports from two African countries accounted for
one-third of the nearly 4,700 new AIDS cases compiled from around
the globe last month, the World Health Organization said Friday.
   A total of 146,569 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome
were reported from 148 countries and territories by the end of
March, an increase of 4,675, the U.N. agency's latest monthly
report shows. Twenty-nine countries said they had no cases of the
fatal disease.
   Uganda overtook France as the country with the second-highest
total behind the United States, which has about 60 percent of all
reported AIDS cases.
   The African nation reported 490 new cases for August through
October, raising its total to 5,998. France, which did not update
its figures, listed 5,655 cases, still by far the highest in Europe.
   Tanzania reported the biggest increase _ 1,100 _ for a total of
4,158 cases as of Dec. 31.
   Uganda and Tanzania accounted for one-third of new cases in the
WHO report. Two other African countries, Burkina Faso and Ghana,
also reported significant increases.
   The U.S. total rose to 86,656, an increase of 499 cases. The
Soviet Union, reporting for November-December, listed two new cases
for a total of seven.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Judge Reduces Punitive Damages To $3 million For Hudson's Lover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $7.25 million in punitive damages awarded
to Rock Hudson's lover in a landmark AIDS lawsuit is excessive and
probably will be reduced to $3 million, the trial judge said Friday.
   Superior Court Judge Bruce R. Geernaert said, however, that he
generally agreed with jury rulings in favor of Marc Christian, who
sued Hudson's estate because Hudson continued to have sex with him
without revealing he had AIDS.
   Geernaert said also he was inclined to reduce the $14.5 million
in compensatory damages the jury awarded to Christian in addition
to the $7.5 million, but deferred his decision until April 21.
   ``I have not at this point decided the amount of reduction,'' he
said. ``The most relevant consideration bearing on my deliberation
is the fear of AIDS (which) is, in reality, a fear of death. And it
is a fear of a miserable, agonizing death.''
   Geernaert said he, like the jury, believed Christian's
assertions during the trial that he lived with that fear after
Hudson, his lover for two years, told the public he had the
sexually transmitted disease.
   Christian, 35, who sat in a back row of the courtroom during the
hearing, declined comment outside court, but he was smiling as he
left the courtroom. He has tested negative for AIDS.
   The judge criticized post-trial statements by defense lawyers
that the jury's huge award was ``a joke,'' and rejected defense
motions, including claims by Hudson's estate and secretary Mark
Miller of juror misconduct.
   Jurors decided on Feb. 15 that Hudson was guilty of outrageous
conduct for not telling his lover he had AIDs.
   Hudson, 58, the star of such movies as ``Pillow Talk'' and
``Giant,'' died Oct. 5, 1985, about three months after the public
learned of his disease. Christian said that was the first he knew
of his lover's affliction, and he testified: ``I thought I was a
dead man.''
   The jury found that Miller conspired with Hudson to keep the
AIDS diagnosis from Christian so the younger man would continue to
engage in sex with Hudson.
   In his decision on punitive damages, the judge said this
assessment against Miller alone was intended to punish as well as
to set an example for others. He said he felt the $3 million figure
would serve that purpose.
   He gave attorneys until April 14 to submit further papers on the
compensatory damage issue and said he would issue his final written
ruling on April 21.

<TEXT>
   Authorities have arrested a Miami
man, accusing him of running clandestine radio and television
broadcasts with the help of the U.S. government and local
opposition leaders.
   Attorney General Carlos Villalaz said Kurt Frederick Muse, 39,
was arrested Wednesday night as he tried to leave Panama and return
to Miami.
   Villalaz told a late night Thurday news conference Muse is
accused of secret broadcast transmissions and attempts to violate
national security.
   Muse was briefly presented to reporters and told them he was not
beaten during his detention.
   The attorney general said Muse operated seven different
broadcast stations, each in a different building within the
capital. Authorities found a radio station at each location and
television stations at two, he said.
   Villalaz showed reporters a video cassette, seized at one
location, reportedly containing a news program by Panamanian
broadcaster Bosco Vallarino, now a resident of Washington, D.C.
   Vallarino is a director of the opposition group Civilian Crusade
and is sought by authorities in connection with the case, the
attorney general said.
   He said arrests were expected shortly of Panamanians involved in
the case.
   Villalaz said U.S. army officials stationed at Clayton Base near
the Panama Canal deposited $3,000 a month in Muse's personal bank
account in the United States to pay for the pretaped broadcast
service.
   According to documents found on his person, Muse reportedly
worked for the U.S. Army in Panama as a civilian school inspector,
he added.
   Panamanian officials said they knew about the broadcasts for
three months, but the sophisticated equipment used made it
difficult to pinpoint the signals' origins.
   The broadcasts reportedly appeared under the name ``Libertad''
and had no fixed transmission time. Announcement fliers were
distributed an hour before transmissions.
   The broadcasts were transmitted automatically with a special
timing mechanism so no one had to run the equipment, officials
said. Electronic equipment designed to interrupt regular TV and
radio transmissions was used to deliver the broadcasts to
Panamanians.
   A communique from the Defense Forces' press office said Muse was
involved with ``the American Embassy, the Secret Service and the
Interamerican Development Agency and formed part of a strategic
plan of the Americans, in association with local opposition
sectors, executed during the past few months.''
   In a separate, apparently unrelated case, authorities on
Thursday freed Panamanian businessman Luis Alberto Arias, formerly
the federal budget planning secretary and director of the national
bank, a day after his arrest for undisclosed reasons.
   Sources in the opposition Democratic Christian Party told The
Associated Press that Arias was arrested Wednesday night at the
airport as he tried to board a U.S.-bound plane.
   No official statement has been made on Arias' arrest or release
and Arias could not be located for comment.
   The government-backed news media repeatedly attacked Arias in
recent months, accusing him of giving the U.S. government
Panamanian bank records.
   The United States last year froze $54 million in Panamanian bank
assests deposited with U.S. banks as part of economic sanctions
designed to force out Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, chief of the
Defense Forces and Panama's de facto leader.
   Washington acted after a federal grand jury in Florida indicted
Noriega on drug trafficking charges. Noreiga denied the charges.

<HEAD>Foley: White House and Congressional Budget Bargainers Are Near Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House and congressional budget talks
recessed Friday, missing their informal deadline for action, but
House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley said the group was in ``the
proximity of an agreement.''
   The group, which includes Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
White House budget director Richard Darman, and the top members of
the House and Senate budget committees, had been pushing to finish
by Friday because of Congress' legislative timetable.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, Congress is supposed to finish a
fiscal 1990 budget resolution by April 15. House Budget Committee
Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., had said he needed to finish the
bargaining with the White House by Friday so that his committee
could complete a formal resolution next week.
   The congressional and White House negotiators planned to
reconvene Monday, and a meeting with Bush was scheduled for Tuesday.
   ``We're getting in the proximity of an agreement. I can't give
you a time or an hour,'' said Foley, D-Wash., after Friday's
all-day bargaining session.
   Several people involved in the talks said, privately, the hope
was to announce an agreement at the White House on Tuesday, but
Foley was cautious.
   ``I would not automatically draw the conclusion that it (the
White House meeting) is a special meeting,'' he said.
   ``We're making good progress, but we're not there yet,'' said
Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., senior Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee.
   The negotiations are designed to ensure that Congress' budget
resolution meets Gramm-Rudman's goal of reducing the deficit to
$100 billion, and that legislation produced to implement the budget
could pass muster with President Bush.
   According to Bush administration estimates, about $28 billion in
deficit reduction _ either new revenues or spending restraints _
must be made to reach the goal.
   The negotiators have been looking to make the package about half
revenues and half spending, with the revenues coming in the form of
asset sales, user fees, and changes in tax law that Bush does not
consider as violating his ``no new taxes'' pledge.
   It is unlikely that any agreement produced in the current talks
would include specific tax proposals or many specific spending
reductions. Instead, the group was working on a broad outline,
leaving details to be worked out later between the administration
and the committees in Congress with jurisdiction over individual
areas.

<HEAD>Government Checks Cases In Which Private Insurance Should Have Paid
Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice and Health and Human Services
departments said Friday they are reviewing a number of instances in
which authorities believe Medicare paid medical bills for which
private insurance carriers were liable.
   The Justice Department's civil division, which recently filed
lawsuits against two private insurance companies to recover money
the government alleges should not have been paid by Medicare, is
continuing to review a number of cases submitted by the Health and
Human Services Department, said spokeswoman Amy Brown.
   Earlier this week, the department filed suit against Provident
Life &amp; Accident Insurance Co., claiming between $7 million and $223
million it contends the company should have paid instead of
Medicare.
   Last month, the department sued Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Michigan, claiming they should have paid at least $2 million in
medical and hospital costs that were billed to Medicare.
   The overpayment issue stems from an overlap in coverage between
Medicare and private health plans for elderly people who continue
to work.
   Under the law, Medicare is only liable for those charges that
are not covered by the elderly employee's private health plan.
   Dennis Siebert, a spokesman for the Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs the Medicare program, said in most cases
the agency is reimbursed by private insurance companies when it
tries to recover charges that should not have been assessed to
Medicare.
   ``In some cases where we have not been able to resolve the
situation with the responsible insurance company, we don't have any
recourse but to seek those legal means to get it back,'' Siebert
said.
   These cases are referred to the HHS inspector general or to the
Justice Department.
   Judy Holtz, a spokeswoman for the inspector general's office,
said Friday evening that the department has a task force on the
matter, combining people from her office _ auditors and
investigators _ as well as personnel from the Social Security
Administration and the HCFA.
   In the past week, the office issued a subpoena against Empire
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York to obtain their records, she
said, adding that the office has ``more than a half-dozen''
investigations under way at this time.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that its investigation
of six years of HCFA records showed the agency failed to correct
the problem of overbilling. The Journal said the amount may be as
much as $10 billion over the period.
   ``I don't think anybody has an exact number of how much money is
involved in these cases, in fact how many cases are involved,''
Siebert said.
   The lawsuit filed here in federal court, accuses Provident,
which is based in Chattanooga, Tenn., of failing to tell Medicare
that it had a primary obligation to pay patients' medical bills.
   Instead, the company directed its claims adjustors in 1983 to
await whatever action Medicare took first, the lawsuit said.
   If Medicare paid the bulk of the patient's bills, Provident then
paid only secondary benefits even if the company had responsibility
to pay the main charges, the suit says.
   The lawsuit does not accuse the company of engaging in fraud.
   Provident, which denies any impropriety, has filed a countersuit
in federal court in Chattanooga charging that the Medicare program
was poorly administered.

   Doctors said Friday they are implanting test
tube embryos in surrogate mothers to help women who cannot bear
children, but they raised ethical questions about doing it for
women who want babies without pregnancy.
   The issue was raised at a conference on in vitro _ or test tube
_ fertilization attended by doctors from 42 nations. Another issue
was the morality of paying surrogates.
   ``Surrogate parenting is a wonderful option for couples who
can't have children any other way, who have nowhere else to turn,''
said William Handel, a lawyer from the Center for Surrogate
Parenting in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   The center charges $15,000 to arrange contracts between couples
and surrogate mothers. However, the medical costs of in vitro
fertilization could raise the total cost to $40,000, according to
the center, which has been involved in 11 such pregnancies.
   More than 800 infants have been produced worldwide through
surrogacy; usually the surrogate mother's eggs are used.
   In the in vitro procedure, however, an embryo is produced in a
test tube using the egg of a woman with a uterine defect, then
implanted in the womb of the surrogate.
   Dr. Wulf H. Utian, a member of the Cleveland team that produced
the world's first test tube baby using a surrogate in 1985, said
the procedure ``raises numerous ethical issues.''
   He cited questions over whether doctors should involve
themselves in contracting surrogates, whether the surrogate should
be paid, whether a surrogate should have a relationship with the
child she bears and who should be considered the baby's legal
parents.
   ``You cannot embark on a program of this nature without giving
serious thought to these issues,'' said Utian, of Cleveland's Mt.
Sinai Medical Center. ``Is it ethical, for example, for a Hollywood
actress to hire a surrogate so as not to have to take time out from
her career?''
   Utian said his team has side-stepped the thornier ethical
questions by dealing only with women who are infertile due to an
absent or non-functioning uterus because of a hysterectomy or a
congenital defect.
   Women in the Cleveland program provide their own surrogates, and
doctors are not involved in handling any financial arrangements. In
the past 18 months, the team has achieved five pregnancies after
implanting embryos in 25 surrogates, Utian said.
   A program in Perth, Australia, uses only surrogates who are
close relatives, preferably sisters, of women who are unable to
carry a child because of uterine defects, said Dr. J.L. Yovich of
the PIVET Medical Center.
   The surrogates are not paid. Yovich said the clinic has achieved
two pregnancies since last year.
   Dr. Zev Rosenwaks of the Cornell Medical Center in New York said
24 clinics in 10 countries, including the United States and
Australia, work with donated eggs.
   The technique involves fertilizing the donor eggs with sperm
from an infertile woman's husband. Any resulting embryos are then
implanted in the woman's uterus.
   He said that in about 55 percent of the cases, eggs are provided
by relatives of the infertile woman. The rest come from anonymous
donors or from test tube patients who have produced excess eggs as
a result of hormone treatment.

<HEAD>Ueberroth Group Opens Talks with Unions ^Eds: INSERTS 5 grafs after
5th graf prvs, bgng ``We're negotiating,' to include Texas Air lawsuit
against Icahn and TWA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

   Unions opened negotiations Friday with the
prospective new owners of Eastern Airlines on multimillion-dollar
concessions that buyers led by Peter V. Ueberroth say are vital to
closing the deal to purchase the strikebound carrier.
   Before agreeing to any concessions, however, union officials
want guarantees the former baseball commissioner and his partners
have a viable plan for running the airline and no plans to sell any
more of Eastern's assets.
   ``This will take some time because it's not only money
involved,'' said an International Association of Machinists
official who asked not to be identified. ``How does our ownership
part shape up? How do we get our passengers back? What kind of job
security is involved?''
   Nevertheless, there was cautious optimism heading into the
talks, which began Friday at IAM headquarters and were expected to
continue through the weekend.
   ``We're negotiating, which is a lot different than it was a day
ago,'' said the IAM official. ``That's progress.''
   Meanwhile, Texas Air Corp. charged in a lawsuit filed in Fort
Bend County district court, near Houston, that TWA Chairman Carl
Icahn and TWA were trying to interfere with the planned sale to the
Ueberroth group.
   Houston-based Texas Air, parent of Continental Airlines and
Eastern, claims that Icahn, a takeover specialist, has ``illegally
communicated and negotiated with union groups representing
employees of Eastern offering inducements to those groups to deal
with Icahn and TWA rather than the Ueberroth-(Thomas) Talbot
group.''
   Texas Air said in a statement that ``by negatively influencing
discussions with the unions and the Ueberroth-Talbot group, Mr.
Icahn can hope to frustrate efforts to get Eastern flying again and
make a more favorable deal for himself.
   ``The delay, confusion and economic damage that Eastern would
suffer could obviously provide the opportunity for Mr. Icahn to buy
assets at bargain basement prices,'' the statement said.
   Icahn could not be reached for comment Friday.
   IAM spokesman Jim Conley said the unions would have no statement
on the Ueberroth negotiations because both sides in the talks had
agreed to a news blackout requested by the bankruptcy judge
overseeing Eastern.
   Reaching agreements with the three unions remains a major hurdle
to completion of the $464 million purchase and Ueberroth can call
off the deal if new contracts are not reached by Tuesday night.
Ueberroth also would need approval from a bankruptcy court in New
York.
   Ueberroth met informally with union leaders Thursday night after
the sale agreement was announced but was not involved in Friday's
negotiations. Ueberroth, considered a tough negotiator as head of
the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and as baseball commissioner, was
expected to join the talks at some point.
   Representatives of the Air Line Pilots Association and the
Transport Workers Union, which represents Eastern flight
attendants, also were involved.
   By midafternoon, the negotiations involved few specifics,
according to sources who declined to be identified, one of whom
described the session as ``highly preliminary'' to more substantive
talks expected to continue throughout the weekend.
   Ueberroth has said he will sell Eastern's Northeast shuttle
service to developer Donald Trump and as part of his purchase
agreement with Texas Air Corp. gave the parent company landing
slots and a gate at New York's LaGuardia Airport as well as a New
York-Montreal route.
   The union leaders, wary those decisions will make it harder for
Eastern to return to profitability, are seeking assurances
Ueberroth plans no further asset sales.
   The IAM struck Eastern a month ago because it refused to accept
concessions demanded by Texas Air Corp. The pilots and flight
attendants have honored IAM picket lines.
   Ueberroth, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity, wants $210 million in wage and benefit concessions.
   Wally Haber, general chairman of the Machinists District 100 in
Miami, said $210 million is the total amount of concessions
requested earlier by Texas Air, $150 million of that from
Machinists. He said he did not know if Ueberroth had adopted the
Texas Air demands.
   Haber said Machinists were willing to accept 15 percent wage and
benefit concessions.
   Union officials have indicated a willingness to accept
concessions provided Eastern was sold to a new owner. Also,
Ueberroth's agreements give employees a 30 percent ownership stake
in return for concessions.
   A spokesman for the flight attendants union, however, noted that
its members made major wage concessions in their last contract
three years ago and were wary of further losses.
   ``More concessions are really not something that we're really
looking forward to,'' said TWU spokesman Jim Gannon. ``Right now
there's really not much more to give.''
   Eastern has been flying about 110 flights a day during the
strike. Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said the sale agreement
caused no noticeable increase in passenger loads Friday.
   Haber said his Miami office, across the street from Eastern
headquarters, has received calls from local union leaders asking if
members should return to work.
   ``Until we sign on the dotted line, we are still on strike,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday overrode U.S.
immigration officials and ordered a Dutch visitor suffering from
AIDS released from prison so he can attend a conference on the
disease.
   Immigration Judge Robert Vinikoor said Hans Paul Verhoef had met
standards required to allow him to be excluded from laws barring
foreigners with dangerous and communicable diseases from entering
the country.
   ``I believe he has shown a waiver of exclusion should be
granted,'' Vinikoor said. ``While I don't want to minimize the risk
of AIDS, the applicant has shown there is a minimal risk to the
United States if he is admitted on a temporary basis.''
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials
immediately asked the federal Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls
Church, Va., to stay the judge's order. But Friday night the board
refused to consider the request, said Thomas Schiltgen, INS
district director in St. Paul.
   Verhoef boarded a flight for San Francisco at 7:25 p.m. Friday
at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The five-day
conference in the California city ends Sunday.
   ``Good!'' Verhoef exclaimed after hearing the judge issue the
order in the courtroom, where he was handed a bouquet of pink roses
by supporters. Later, Verhoef spoke to reporters at the airport.
   ``I'm very glad that I can do what I have to do, now that the
U.S. government has let me go,'' he said.
   ``I'm very disappointed being imprisoned and getting this
treatment in this country,'' he said, adding that he was disturbed
about having to raise $10,000 bond before leaving Minnesota.
   Judge Vinikoor ordered Verhoef to post a $10,000 bond to enforce
the terms of the waiver, which is in effect until April 28. The
money was provided by supporters of the Minnesota AIDS Project
within a few hours of the judge's ruling, said Helene Haapala, one
of Verhoef's lawyers.
   Vinikoor's decision overrode the INS action earlier in the day.
The INS denied Verhoef's request for a waiver to attend the AIDS
conference.
   ``The risk of harm by an AIDS-infected alien in the absence of
humanitarian reasons for the temporary admission of aliens far
outweighs the privilege of an alien to enter the United States to
participate in a conference,'' Richard Norton, associate
commissioner for examinations, wrote in the INS ruling.
   At the hearing before Vinikoor, Verhoef stopped short of saying
he wouldn't engage in any sexual act while in the United States. He
promised only to practice ``safe sex.''
   ``I'm prepared to say under oath that I will abstain from risky
behavior,'' Verhoef said under questioning from Richard Soli, INS
district counsel.
   ``Is safe sex 100 percent safe?'' Soli asked.
   ``In my knowledge, yes,'' Verhoef replied.
   Verhoef described alternatives to intercourse including hugs,
sexual caresses and special toys. He said he brought toys that
could be used without a partner.
   ``I think everyone, all of the persons who have AIDS or who have
tested positive for HIV should be aware of the fact that they
shouldn't take any steps in spreading the virus,'' he said.
   ``I have got AIDS myself, and I realize very well what it is to
have AIDS. I don't want to do that to anyone else,'' he said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Verhoef was detained by immigration officials on Sunday at the
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport as he was traveling to
the conference in San Francisco. He had been held at the Oak Park
Heights state prison.
   The judge said immigration officials acted properly in
apprehending Verhoef. But he said Congress allows discretion in
interpreting the law.
   His ruling echoed Thursday's recommendation by INS district
officials in St. Paul, who had said Verhoef should be allowed to
attend the conference. The U.S. immigration officials' opposite
stance drew fire from Dr. Tim Wolfred, executive director of the
San Francisco AIDS Foundation.
   ``The INS has decided to enforce a law founded on hatred,
bigotry and ignorance,'' he said. ``This decision says the federal
government has no compassion for people with HIV disease or
understanding of how AIDS is transmitted.''

   A record heat wave throttled Southern
California for a fourth day Friday as nurses tried to keep patients
cool in a hospital without air conditioning and anyone who could
get away fled to the beach.
   The mercury hit 100 degrees in downtown Los Angeles at 1 p.m.,
smashing the April 7 record of 88 set in 1904. Downtown had a
record-tying 100 Tuesday and record highs of 105 Wednesday and 106
Thursday.
   Other afternoon readings included 109 in Palm Springs, 101 in
Burbank and Ontario, 102 in San Bernardino, 93 in San Diego, and
80s and 90s statewide, including San Francisco and the San Joaquin
Valley.
   An earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale hit Southern
California about 1 p.m. but the crowd on Huntington State Beach was
unmoved: ``It was kind of like, `We're out on the beach, you've had
an earthquake, don't bother us,''' said lifeguard Patrick Zuniga.
   One of the most serious problems posed by the heat wave, caused
by inland high pressure holding off ocean breezes, was lack of air
conditioning in the huge UCLA Medical Center, where a Thursday
night fire knocked out the cooling system. No injuries were
reported and no patients had to be moved because of the fire.
   The hospital shut its emergency room, canceled surgery and
turned off hot lights. Fans were brought in and nurses gave baths
to keep the 462 patients in the 711-bed hospital cool. An inside
thermometer read 86 degrees at 10:30 a.m. Friday, said spokesman
Rich Elbaum.
   The cooling system was repaired enough to work at 50 percent
capacity by 11 a.m. and was expected to bring patient wards down to
72 degrees by early Saturday at the latest, said spokeswoman Vicki
Beck.
   ``There were no major problems with patient care during the air
conditioning outage,'' Ms. Beck said. The emergency room reopened
at 3 p.m. and surgeries were expected to be on schedule Saturday.
   Thousands flocked to the coast to seek relief from the
sweltering inland temperatures to swim in water that ranged from 61
to 64 degrees _ but could only be reached after a trek across
blistering sand.
   Lifeguard Randy DeGregori, watching over some of the 60,000
people crowded near the water on Santa Monica Beach, figured the
sand was 10 or 15 degrees hotter than the air. ``People should wear
shoes,'' he advised.
   ``It's beautiful,'' said lifeguard Steve Voorhees at the south
end of Santa Monica Bay. ``The only damper on the thing is the smog
down here.''
   A smog alert was forecast Saturday in Los Angeles and east to
the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys and the Riverside and San
Bernardino areas. The Air Quality Management District predicted
``very unhealthful'' air in those areas after a week of record heat.
   Elsewhere, the Sierra Nevada beckoned weekenders with daytime
highs in the 40s and 50s.
   ``The weather is absolutely gorgeous,'' said Gary Shultz,
general manager of the Mammoth Lakes Resort Association. ``The
snowpack is still over 6 feet on the mountain and skiing is great.''
   The National Weather Service predicted the beginning of a
cooling trend Saturday with the dissipation of the Santa Ana
weather condition, which began with warm wind last weekend.

<TEXT>
   South Africa said Friday it will use
all the force needed to crush an incursion by black nationalist
guerrillas, and the territorial administrator said U.N.-sponsored
elections set for November may not be held.
   Louis Pienaar, installed by South Africa, said there is a ``de
facto suspension'' of the U.N. idependence plan, which also calls
for combatants to be confined, and ``it has become impossible to
contemplate such elections under the prevailing circumstances.''
   R.F. Botha, the South African foreign minister, said he had
informed U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the
decision to activate more soldiers, but he did not specify the
number.
   He said a major reason was that some guerrillas of the
South-West Africa People's Organization were approaching areas
where white farmers live.
   In New York the U.N. Security Council held private consultations
on the crisis Friday. The council president, Soviet Ambassador
Aleksandr M. Belonogov, said later that after reading Botha's
letter, the council is satisfied that South Africa is committed to
granting independence to Namibia .
   Newspapers in Harare, Zimbabwe said the six ``front-line
states'' ofered the U.N. peacekeeping force up to 6,000 soldiers to
help stop the fighting _ 1,000 each from Angola, Botswana,
Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
   They said the decision was made Thursday at an emergency summit
in Luanda, Angola.
   South Africa's military said it ordered out warplanes for the
first time Friday and reported SWAPO had brought its first tanks
across the border from Angola. Spokesman Col. Japie Dreyer said
four jet fighters fired on SWAPO positions Thursday, killing 17
guerrillas.
   Botha flew to Windhoek for emergency talks Saturday with
officials from the United Nations, Cuba and Angola. Senior U.S. and
Soviet diplomats will observe.
   The fiercest fighting seen in the 23-year confrontation raged
across northern Namibia on Friday, a week after a U.N.-supervised
truce was to end the war.
   At least 261 SWAPO guerrillas and 28 security force members have
been killed since Saturday, South African police officials said.
   On Thursday, SWAPO said 38 guerrillas died and nine were
missing. The guerrilla organization charges many of those killed by
security forces are civilians.
   South Africa says SWAPO has sent more than 1,900 guerrillas into
northern Namibia this week, in violation of an accord requiring the
insurgents remain at bases in Angola, at least 100 miles from its
border with Namibia.
   The United Nations has allowed South Africa to deploy up to six
units of troops to support paramilitary police, but Botha said
Friday the security forces ``at the present level are not able to
stem the incursion.''
   Anton Lubowski, one of SWAPO's few white officials, told a
Windhoek news conference the head of the U.N. operation in Namibia,
Finland's Martti Ahtisaari, should be replaced immediately.
   ``They (U.N. officials) are coming with exactly the same
arguments as South Africa that the guerrillas must be disarmed,''
Lubowski said. ``It is clear they are working with the South
Africans and are in the South Africans' pocket.''
   Botha said of Ahtisaari: ``He's in an awful position. It was
never his task to handle a violation of (U.N. Resolution) 435.''
   The U.N. task is ``to observe, patrol and prevent border
infiltration of a very limited nature,'' Botha said.
   The United Nations authorized 4,650 troops for Namibia, but has
been criticized because less than 1,000 have arrived.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said military observers will
begin pouring into Namibia during the weekend.
   An 850-member contingent of Finnish observers will be airlifted
by the U.S. military Saturday to Monday, and other arrangements are
being made to fly in 850 Malaysian and 850 Kenyan troopers, he said.
   U.N. officials say the independence plan made no provision for
SWAPO bases in Namibia. Even Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, whose country has hosted the guerrillas since 1966,
criticized SWAPO.
   ``I regret the SWAPO leadership was not able to exercise total
control over its guerrillas at the critical moment of the start of
Resolution 435, by stopping anyone crossing the Angolan-Namibian
frontier,'' dos Santos said Thursday.
   SWAPO leaders contend most of the guerrillas had been in Namibia
for some time and have no intention of accepting a surrender offer
South Africa says will expire Saturday. A U.N. report blames the
guerrillas for a ``major incursion,'' according to British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Several captured guerrillas have said they returned to Namibia
in search of U.N. personnel and expected no confrontations with
security forces.

<TEXT>
   A man who claimed to possess taped conversations
of Tawana Brawley's advisers expressing doubts about her tale of
gang-rape by whites was acquitted Friday of perjury and obstructing
justice.
   A U.S. District Court jury found Samuel McClease innocent on the
third day of deliberations in the week-long trial.
   McClease, 27, of Newark, N.J., added another twist to the
tangled Brawley case last June when he told federal investigators
and news reporters that he had bugged the conversations of Ms.
Brawley's advisers and could produce tapes undermining her story.
   Ms. Brawley, a black teenager from the upstate community of
Wappingers Falls, N.Y., claimed she had been abducted and raped by
up to six white men _ including one with a police badge _ in
November 1987.
   On the advice of her lawyers and family adviser, Ms. Brawley,
who was then 15, refused to cooperate with the grand jury
investigating her case, creating national headlines.
   McClease, a self-described surveillance expert, claimed to have
tapes demonstrating that Ms. Brawley's advisers _ the Rev. Al
Sharpton and attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton H. Maddox Jr. _
did not themselves believe her story of abduction and sexual abuse.
   All the Brawley advisers denied McClease's allegations, and the
10 tapes McClease later produced for a federal grand jury turned
out to be blank.
   Last November, after a seven-month investigation, a state grand
jury did not indict anyone and issued a report that concluded Ms.
Brawley concocted her story. A month later, a federal grand jury
indicted McClease on one count each of perjury and obstruction of
justice.
   McClease heaved a sigh of relief as the verdict was read and
later told reporters: ``I'm happy. Right now, I want to put this
behind me and get back into electronics _ legally!''

   World trade talks hit a snag Friday when European
nations made an unexpected proposal in negotiations on textile
trading, officials said.
   Negotiators at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
meeting settled differences between the European Economic Community
and the United States on agricultural imports.
   The 12-nation EEC, however, unexpectedly offered a new textiles
proposal of ``a substantial nature'' said GATT spokesman David
Woods.
   Woods said Arthur Dunkel, GATT director-general, was ``angry''
at the development.
   But Tran Van-Thinh, head of the EEC delegation, said that ``much
employment and investment'' was at stake.
   ``We have the right and the duty to make any proposal right up
to the last minute of the negotiations,'' he said without
elaborating on the EEC's plan.
   Developing countries with large textile industries want liberal
regulations. Industrialized countries such as the United States and
EEC members are concerned about the impact a lack of restrictions
might have on domestic industries.
   Woods said discussions would continue through the night and that
Dunkel would try to present a final proposal on all issues for
approval on Saturday.
   An agreement would automatically include 11 other world trade
accords reached at a GATT meeting in December in Montreal. It also
would clear the way for more progress in the so-called Uruguay
Round of trade-freeing negotiations, due to end 1990.
   Negotiations on agricultural imports were stalled by a U.S.
demand that supports be eliminated. The EEC had resisted the idea.
   The agreement reached Friday calls for an overall freeze on farm
supports and import barriers through 1990. It calls for countries
to reduce their subsidies in 1990 but does not specify by how much.
   U.S. officials were not available for comment on the accord.

<HEAD>With North Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of testimony Friday by
Oliver North in the Iran-Contra trial as he was questioned by
defense attorney Brendan Sullivan.
   SULLIVAN: Colonel North, yesterday when we concluded we had
focused on the fact that there were four ways that you and the
administration assisted the freedom fighters during the time period
you spoke about. Now, I'd like to address your attention to the
period in the summer of 1985. There's been testimony about letters
received at the National Security Council directed to Mr. (Robert)
McFarlane from Congressman (Michael) Barnes (D-Md.) and Congressman
(Lee) Hamilton (D-Ind.). Would you tell the jury what was the
relationship that was existing between the Congress and the
administration at that time? ...
   NORTH: By the summer of 1985, what had been a long political
warfare between the opponents of the president's policy and the
administration was, I guess, made worse by the fact that the
Congress voted to approve humanitarian assistance. ... The
administration countered with accusations of leaks and that
Congress would leak things before they ever happened and people
alleging that Congress had a unilateral veto, a one man veto over
any kind of covert action or anything else, particularly focused on
the Central America problem, and so that even though the Congress
had voted to approve some aid of a nonmilitary nature the opponents
to the administration became even louder in their opposition to the
resistance.
   SULLIVAN: Now, Congressman Barnes ... was he a strong opponent
of aid to the freedom fighters?
   NORTH: Yes, sir, he was. ... Congressman Barnes was at that time
the chairman of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. And that was the subcommittee ... that
voted on all of the foreign aid for the countries in Latin America.
   SULLIVAN: Now ... Congressman Hamilton ... what was his position
in relation to the support for the freedom fighters?
   NORTH: Congressman Hamilton (Chairman of the House Intelligence
Committee) ... was not as vocal as was Congressman Barnes but he
was opposed to military aid to the resistance and he was a strong
opponent.
   SULLIVAN: So both congressmen, both of whom were against support
for the freedom fighters, both of whom testified here in court sent
... letters in August, 1985....
   NORTH: Yes, sir.
   SULLIVAN: Now, Colonel, there came a time when you talked to Mr.
McFarlane about how the National Security Council should respond to
these inquiries?
   NORTH: ... Mr. McFarlane and I had a conversation ... and that
discussion focused along the lines of my saying we shouldn't be
answering this, that this kind of information is what is properly
the prerogative of the White House and the president and we ought
to invoke what is called executive privilege. We don't have to
answer this. ... (North read the letter from Rep. Hamilton
inquiring about reported actions taken by the NSC to support the
activities of the Contras despite legislative prohibitions under
the Boland Amendment.)
   SULLIVAN: So how did you tell Mr. McFarlane how to respond to
Congressman Hamilton's request?
   NORTH: What I urged that he do is that he go back and simply say
we're not going to respond to this. That the activities of the NSC
... is not a matter for congressional intrusion.
   SULLIVAN: What did Mr. McFarlane respond to that?
   NORTH: ... He said well, give me a stab or give me a try at
answering this letter. ...
   SULLIVAN: Now, when you drafted this (for McFarlane) what was
your intention?
   NORTH: Well, my intention was to continue to try not to give a
response. ...
   SULLIVAN: And (McFarlane took) ... two paragraphs which are the
ending paragraphs of your draft?
   NORTH: Yes, sir.
   SULLIVAN: And the rest of the letter was something that he wrote?
   NORTH: Yes, sir ... having been told several times that my
approach on this issue was too confrontational ... he didn't want
to hear any more from me about it. ... I took this note along with
his draft ... and went over and made a final memo to go out with
the substantive lengthy answer on this matter.
   SULLIVAN: Why?
   NORTH: Because the answer that he wanted to give was wrong. It
was not accurate. It was factually incorrect.
   SULLIVAN: And tell the jury again what answer did you want to
give?
   NORTH: I wanted to give an answer _ my preference right from the
start was to give an answer that would have read something to the
effect, Mr. Hamilton, this is the purview of the presidency. The
Constitution has a separation of powers and the Congress and the
presidency are two coequal branches of government and we don't have
to answer those questions.

<HEAD>Opposition Says Government Reform Bill Insufficient For Fair Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition branded as insufficient
a electoral reforms package introduced in the National Assembly on
Friday by the leftist Sandinista government.
   The bill includes proposed reforms in elections and mass media
as part of a regional peace accord reached at a Central American
summit meeting on Feb. 14.
   The reforms are to ensure fair general elections, which
President Daniel Ortega moved up by 10 months, to Feb. 25, 1990.
   ``This is a joke,'' said Sergio Torres, a deputy from the
Conservative Democratic Party, which, with 14 deputies, has the
largest opposition representation in the 96-member assembly. The
governing Sandinista National Liberation Front has 61 deputies.
   Torres complained about a government proposal to allow
Nicaraguans abroad to register for voting at Nicaraguan consulates,
but require they vote in Nicaragua.
   ``I was under the impression that any consulate is considered
part of the national territory,'' Torres told reporters.
   Mauricio Diaz, leader of the Popular Social Christian Party,
said the proposed 30 minutes allowed daily to political parties in
state-run television and radio stations was not enough.
   ``Now that they're proposing that anything with 27 members can
call itself a party, (obtaining air time) will be very difficult,''
Diaz said.
   He also said allowing members of the armed forces to vote goes
against opposition demands.
   ``This package is not what the opposition has demanded,''
Virgilio Godoy, head of the Conservative Democratic Party, told The
Associated Press later.
   He called the proposals an attempt to make it seem the
Sandinistas are serious about democratization.
   ``This package is not directed at Nicaragua, it's not for
internal consumption,'' Godoy said. Ortega ``just wants to carry
that package in his pocket when he goes to Europe.''
   The president is leaving on an eight-country European tour April
25 to lobby for money and political support for Nicaragua.
   At the February summit in El Salvador, Ortega promised reforms
to ensure free and fair balloting, along with moving up the
elections. Under the accord, reforms must be in place by April 25.
   The five presidents _ of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras,
Guatemala and Costa Rica _ also agreed to draft a plan by mid-May
to dismantle the Nicaraguan rebel force, known as Contras.
   About 11,000 Contras and their relatives have lived in Honduran
jungle camps in Honduras since their leaders and the Sandinistas
signed a cease-fire in March 1988, a month after the U.S. Congress
cut off military aid to the rebels.
   The government reform package on Friday was sent to committee
for subsequent assembly debate.

<TEXT>
   President Bush called out the military
Friday to help clean up the Exxon Valdez spill as forecasts of
shifting wind and high tides raised fears the oil might be blown
back into the fragile fjords of Alaska's central coast.
   As the cleanup entered its third exasperating week, state
officials said they had worked out an agreement between Exxon and
the Coast Guard by modifying their request for a complete Coast
Guard takeover.
   Exxon will handle contracts and purchases and the Coast Guard
will direct field activity, said Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the
Department of Environmental Conservation.
   ``It's a resolution of what we thought was a real logjam,''
Kelso said.
   So far, only an estimated 16,000 barrels, about 7 percent of the
10.1 million gallons spilled when the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a
reef, has been sopped and vacuumed up from the once clear water of
Prince William Sound. By Friday, the crude oil had floated over a
3,000-square-mile area.
   The Good Friday spill has killed thousands of birds and sea
otters along the central Alaskan coast and fishermen have lost
millions of dollars.
   Bush said he directed Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to make
military forces and equipment available and Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner to coordinate the federal effort.
   Bush had been under pressure from members of Congress and
Alaskan officials to intervene. Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper on
Wednesday asked the Coast Guard to take over management of the
cleanup from Exxon.
   The president insisted, however, ``We are not federalizing this
operation,'' and that ``this should not relieve Exxon from any of
its responsibilities or liabilities.''
   Kelso said the military is welcome to pitch in moving equipment,
but that there was no need now to line the shore with soldiers.
   ``More people will be needed for shoreline cleanup but that is
not what the proper focus should be right now,'' he said. ``We
don't intend to change our momentum at all. We don't know how long
it (military mobilization) will take, but we're not going to sit
back and wait.''
   Cowper said he was pleased with Bush's action, although he'd
prefer available Alaskans work the cleanup before the military.
   ``It appears the president is meeting the objectives we had in
asking the Coast Guard to take over the spill cleanup in Prince
William Sound,'' the governor said.
   Interviewed late Friday, Rear Adm. Edward Nelson, the Coast
Guard's top official in Alaska, said he would use some military
personnel in liaison and staff positions, but ``we're not going to
bring in a lot of troops, certainly not now.''
   Nelson also said the command of the cleanup has been
straightened out.
   ``I never felt they (Exxon) were unresponsive or
irresponsible,'' Nelson said. ``I think we had the problem with
organization. That's what frustrated everybody. We now see a clean
line of what's going to go on.''
   Exxon has flown in 3.5 million pounds of equipment and hired
1,000 cleanup workers. About 160,000 feet of oil containment boom
and 29 skimmers are in Prince William Sound, and an additional
120,000 feet of boom and 32 skimmers are en route, said Exxon
Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi.
   ``If you think about the challenge we've had here, we were told
our most important objective was to defend the four fisheries and
we've been successful. I guess victory is in the eyes of the
beholder,'' Iarossi said. ``All the equipment has been deployed and
is working very well.''
   He said Exxon will pay for a public relations campaign by
seafood processers saying Alaska seafood is still wholesome.
   Northerly wind has helped push the oil offshore, but the
National Weather Service said a shift in the wind was possible over
the weekend. Weather service regional chief scientist Gary Hufford
said southeasterly wind blowing at 20 mph is expected for a few
days.
   ``If we have southeasterly winds, hundreds of more miles will be
impacted'' from Kenai Peninsula to Kodiak Island, said Jim Hayden,
coordinator of the state's cleanup effort.
   A possible storm, along with anticipated high tides of 15 feet,
would present a double jeopardy to the efforts to contain and
remove the oil.
   ``We've been blessed with reasonable weather,'' said Hufford,
``but that luck is changing.''
   At Kenai Fjords National Park, a remote refuge 100 miles
southwest of Valdez, workers began setting up floating oil booms as
a sheen of oil washed toward the small inlets and fjords of the
coastline park.
   ``We have our teams ready and we're trying to prepare for the
eventuality of a storm,'' said Ron Smith, a Department of Interior
spokesman for a joint state-federal cleanup effort.
   Prince William Sound fishermen, who have been using oil booms
and a ragtag fleet of loaned equipment to protect vital salmon
fisheries, warn the storm and tides could push the oil over their
barriers and kill millions of salmon fry.
   ``We're emphasizing the need to recover the oil,'' Kelso said.
``Every barrel of oil that comes out of the water is a barrel of
oil that is not doing further damage to the sound.''

   A document produced in Oliver North's trial
sheds new light on George Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair,
showing that he helped the Reagan administration effort to support
the Nicaraguan Contras despite a ban on U.S. aid.
   The document, read to the Iran-Contra jury by North's defense
attorneys, placed Bush at a May 1985 meeting in Honduras with
then-President Roberto Suazo. It says Bush informed Suazo of
President Reagan's decision to speed U.S. military and economic aid
to the country.
   What set up the Bush meeting were behind-the-scenes discussions
among North and other U.S. officials on a plan to seek assistance
from other countries to tide over the Nicaraguan rebels at a time
when direct or indirect American assistance was outlawed by
Congress.
   A preface to the document said ``the United States has admitted
for purposes of this trial the following facts to be true,'' and it
went to lengths to stitch together how the secret covert support
program worked.
   In effect, the Reagan program established a ``quid pro quo''
relationship basing U.S. assistance to Honduras and some other
countries at least in part on those countries' willingness to help
sustain the Contra fighting force.

   A former NATO commander wants to reduce the
alliance's active conventional forces by 50 percent, with the
Warsaw Pact cutting its strength to the same number of troops.
   Calling NATO's current proposal only a starting point for
negotiations with the Warsaw Pact nations, retired Army Gen. Andrew
J. Goodpaster on Thursday told the Senate Armed Services Committee
his plan amounts to a ``radical restructuring'' on both sides.
   The current NATO proposal calls for a 5 percent to 10 percent
cut in battle tanks, heavy artillery and armored troop carriers.
The offer came in response to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
proposal last December to cut the Red Army by 10 percent with a
reduction of 5,000 tanks and 50,000 troops in Eastern Europe.
   ``I do not think the interests of the West would be served if
that's as far as we went,'' said Goodpaster, who served as supreme
Allied commander in Europe from 1968 to 1969.

   After days of intense negotiations with Texas
Air Corp., Peter V. Ueberroth must wrangle with Eastern Airlines'
rebellious unions and wrest concessions that Eastern boss Frank
Lorenzo was unable to get.
   A group led by Ueberroth agreed Thursday to buy strikebound
Eastern for about $464 million. The deal would give Eastern's
30,000 employees a 30 percent stake in the airline in exchange for
about $210 million in contract concessions.
   Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, flew to Washington
immediately after a hastily called news conference Thursday
afternoon and met with representatives of Eastern's unions. The
talks were to resume this morning, said sources speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Union officials said they hoped the deal could end the month-old
walkout at the nation's seventh-largest airline and get Eastern
flying a full schedule.

   Eastern Airlines strikers, calling their monthlong
walkout a victory, say they're ready to take pay cuts and get back
to work _ as long as it's without boss Frank Lorenzo at the
controls.
   Cautious union leaders, however, warned the strike won't end
until new contracts are signed. But most workers jubilantly greeted
the sale to a group including former baseball commissioner Peter
Ueberroth as a done deal _ even though it reportedly involves some
$210 million in union concessions.
   The $464 million agreement would give employees a 30 percent
share in the company in exchange for wage concessions. Eastern,
under parent company Texas Air Corp., had demanded $125 million in
wage and benefits cuts.
   ``This is better than winning the lottery, because 30,000 people
won it together,'' said flight attendant Alice Martinez. ``It's
wonderful.''

   The sap from maple trees is running so
slow in parts of the Northeast that some towns have canceled their
annual pancake breakfasts for lack of syrup.
   ``One guy told me he didn't do enough to cover his pancakes,''
said Wilson Clark, president of the Vermont Maple Sugarmakers'
Association.
   The season for tapping maple trees for sap, which is boiled down
to syrup, is nearing the end in southern New England amid signs
that warm weather and an insect with a taste for maples will
sharply lower syrup production.
   ``Everybody is down at least 50 percent to 75 percent, with more
on the heavy side,'' said Edward McColgan, president of the
Massachusetts Maple Sugar Producers Association.

   The past has come alive in Hungary,
where people are striding into a future they hope will spell
democracy.
   They sit on park benches reading about Imre Nagy, the hitherto
disgraced leader of the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising that was crushed
by Soviet tanks. Three new books on Nagy sell rapidly at stores and
street stalls.
   An old coat of arms abolished by the communists in 1948 has
become a symbol of national pride. Parliament has joined the
discussion on possibly restoring it as the national emblem.
   The wave of nostalgia peaked March 15, when an estimated 100,000
people turned out to mark the anniversary of a failed revolt in
1848 against Austrian Hapsburg rule.
   It became clear then that the preoccupation with the past has
everything to do with the future.
   The aims of both the 1848 and 1956 revolts and reforms today are
the same: ``Constitutional democracy and national independence,''
Miklos Tamas-Gaspar, one of the leaders of the many new independent
political groups, told the crowd.
   Hungarians are well aware of their past failures in trying now
to achieve those goals. Diplomats call it a ``healthy pessimism,''
but others fear the dash for reform could end in disaster.
   They speculate about armed action by the military or old-guard
communists who have also organized their own groups in recent
months. And, despite the new leeway from Moscow, they are still
mindful of the bloodshed that ended reform in 1956.
   ``The cart can't go backwards, but it can overturn,'' the
reformist Politburo member Reszoe Nyers said in a recent radio
interview.
   Even Hungarians most active in creating the change cannot
explain how it happened so fast and hesitate to predict how it will
continue.
   Yet both the communist leadership and the founders of
independent movements recognize they can only achieve lasting
change by working together.
   With the memory of 1956 still sharp, both sides are wary of each
other. Both have much to lose _ the communists their power, and the
independent groups their chance to bring change.
   But Hungarians know the new climate in Moscow means the time for
change is ``now or never,'' as a banner at the March 15 rally said.
   On recent visits to the Kremlin, Communist Party leader Karoly
Grosz and Premier Miklos Nemeth came home with what they said was
an OK from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to go ahead with reform,
including political pluralism.
   The first test will be the 1990 parliamentary elections, whose
form is still unclear.
   In some respects, the March 15 rally was the start of
campaigning for those elections. The independent groups showed they
have become a force, drawing far larger crowds than those at a
communist rally.
   There seems to be vague agreement on all sides, however, that
completely free elections will not be possible by 1990, and that
some provisional arrangement should be made to get the independents
into Parliament so they can help lay the groundwork for completely
open elections in 1995.
   For the independents, it is essential to maintain unity, both
within their own ranks and against the communists.
   ``Unity is most important in the face of the monolithic power
which is still in place,'' said Rudolf Joo, a leading member of the
Hungarian Democratic Forum, one of the most influential and broadly
based groups.
   Ferenc Koeszeg, a leading member of the League of Free
Democrats, says it is important for the independent groups to work
out a common position before negotiating with the communists, who
opened tentative talks with each group in February.
   Another problem for the independents, with their largely
intellectual base in Budapest, is to attract support from workers
who are increasingly unhappy with price increases and
government-imposed austerity measures.
   The communists have published their own ``action program,''
committing themselves to a multiparty system, free elections and
representational democracy.
   ``The Communist Party is playing a role as if it were one of the
(independent) groups,'' said the Free Democrats' Koeszeg. ``With
the action program, they are trying to occupy the place of an
opposition group.''
   Communist leaders say they would in fact be willing to go into
opposition but emphasize they are confident of at least 51 percent
of the vote in the elections.
   The party's confidence stems from its 40 years of political
experience and control of the media, while the independent groups
are just getting started.
   ``In a one-party system, the party has a monopoly of people's
thinking and even their souls,'' said Sandor Csoori, a poet and a
Forum leader.

   This is a land where the kings
take turns and have no coronations because they wear no crowns. But
when the latest in the monarchal rotation kisses a dagger with a
wavy blade April 26 he will become the Yang di-Pertuan Agung _ the
one who is chief among the most prominent.
   The ninth agung since the country's independence from Britain in
1957, he will keep his throne until 1994, then turn it over to an
elected successor. Neither the public nor Parliament has a vote.
The privilege rests only on the heads of Malaysia's nine royal
houses.
   One of them is chosen by secret ballot of his fellow monarchs
for a five-year reign as king of kings for this Southeast Asian
federation of 17 million people. When his term is up he returns to
his home state where his throne has been kept warm in his absence
by his eldest son.
   Nine of Malaysia's 13 states have a hereditary ruler. The others
have to make do with a governor, named by the agung acting on the
the advice of the prime minister.
   The agung is Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah, 60, the sultan of Perak,
who was elected March 2. He is a lawyer and career civil servant
who was lord president of the Supreme Court in 1982-84. He left the
judiciary to succeed his late father in 1985 as head of the Perak
royal household.
   Though not as wealthy as most of the other rulers, Sultan Azlan
is widely regarded as the best educated. He attended the
then-prestigious Government English School, where the sons of royal
and well-to-do Malays were groomed for government service in
colonial days. From there he went to the University of Nottingham
and Lincoln's Inn, both in Britain, and was called to the English
bar in 1954.
   The rotating throne solved a sticky protocol problem when
Malaysia, then known as Malaya, shed its colonial ties with Britain
in 1957. Since no one of the state rulers would have been accepted
by the rest as permanent head of state, then-Prime Minister Tunku
Abdul Rahman devised the unique system of giving every state with a
ruler a turn on the throne.
   Years later in retirement, the Tunku, himself a prince of the
royal house of Kedah, said the agung was vested ``with all the
powers such as those given to soverigns of Great Britain and other
democratic monarchies of the world ... as symbolic head of state,
the agung never interferes with the actual running of the
government.''
   Political power rests in a British-style national Parliament and
state legislatures, which are elected every five years.
   In eight years in office, the current prime minister, Mohamad
Mahathir, has had uneven relations with the royal houses. His
government tried in 1983 to abolish the king's veto over
legislation.
   The rulers resisted and Mahathir took his case to the country
with a series of public rallies. A compromise was reached in which
Mahathir agreed that the agung could delay legislation and send it
back to Parliament for review, but if it passed again, it would
become law, a practice similar to the way the House of Lords
operates with the House of Commons in Britain's Parliament.
   Seven states call their hereditary rulers sultans. Perlis makes
do with a rajah and Negri Sembilan refers to its ruler as Yang
di-Pertuan Besar, one who is chief of state.
   The state rulers provide a continuing focus for Malay identity
in a country in which Malays account for about half of the
population, which also includes sizable Chinese and Indian
minorities. Sultans function as important arbiters of Malay custom
and religion.
   Some royals are criticized for their love of big cars, large
palaces, frequent trips abroad and and aloofness toward their
subjects. They are paid the equivalent of about $23,440 a month.
But most nurture their subjects, fulfilling the traditional role of
benevolent leader.
   Only the nine-member Council of Rulers can oust an agung, by
majority vote. Agungs are bound by the constitution ``to act at all
times on the advice of the Cabinet.''
   An agung can be re-elected for a second consecutive term but
none has been. There is a tacit agreement among the rulers that
once an agung's term is completed he returns to his state palace to
give someone else a turn.
   A deputy king, or timbalan agung, also is selected, which has a
proved prudent thing to do since three of the eight previous agungs
died in office.

<TEXT>
   At one point in NBC's new comedy, ``Nearly
Departed,'' the ghost of snotty, recently deceased British
professor Grant Pritchard ponders, ``I wonder if there's small-talk
after death?''
   Only in sitcom purgatory, where dwelleth ``Nearly Departed.''
   A moderately amusing half-hour, it premieres tonight for a
spring tryout through May 15.
   The show is in something of a comedy twilight zone. It goes far
enough that it will no doubt prove distasteful to some viewers, yet
it doesn't have the wicked edge that should be expected of a comedy
about death _ especially one starring Eric Idle, former member of
``Monty Python's Flying Circus.''
   The writers do their best _ ``We're dead, and we'll just have to
live with it'' _ and Idle is delightful, but there's not much of
anywhere to go with this tired, easily tasteless premise.
   It seems the professor and his wife, Claire (Caroline McWilliams
of ``Soap''), were killed in a rock slide on a mountain road. How
they ever hooked up is a mystery, along with many of the other plot
twists. She's sweet-natured and charitable. He's a testy elitist.
   ``You always look on the dark side of things,'' she says
soothingly.
   ``Death IS the dark side of things,'' he complains.
   Unable to go on to the afterlife for unexplained reasons, they
return to their beloved bookish and well-appointed home in the
Chicago suburbs so Grant can be constantly perturbed by its boorish
new blue-collar residents, a plumber named Mike Dooley (Stuart
Pankin of ``Not Necessarily the News''), his wife (Wendy Schaal)
and their teen-age son (Jay Lambert).
   In the pilot, Grant is at first incensed at being dead, but
begins to adjust when he realizes he is capable of such antics as
climbing into the shower to gaze undetected at naked Mrs. Dooley.
   Having Grant and Claire standing around making comments about
the unaware Dooleys is fun for about a nanosecond. So, we soon meet
Grampa (Henderson Forsythe), who inexplicably can see and hear the
Pritchards, but, of course, hides this from his daughter and
son-in-law lest they think he's bonkers.
   In the weak subplot that drives Act 2, it seems Grampa has lost
his driver's license and delivery job and fears he will lose his
independence if he doesn't get his license renewed. Claire wants to
help out of a sense of philanthropy. Grant's assistance is
motivated by his desire to rid the house of at least one inhabitant
_ if Pops can drive he can live somewhere else.
   Then follows a nicely executed but basically free-standing
sketch, a turn on the well-used driver's license bureau scene (the
classic being the ``Taxi'' episode when Jim had to get take the
written test: ``What's a yellow light mean?'' ``Go slow.'' ``What's
... a ... yellow ... light ... mean?'') It's pretty funny, though
it illustrates the series' reliance on Idle, hilarious as he acts
out the letters of the eye chart to help Gramps pass the test.
Check out ``R.''
   The final punchline goes thud, perhaps a portent of things to
come. Ultimately, there's not much reason to tune in again to
``Nearly Departed.'' Unless the show goes in a direction that is in
no way indicated by the premiere, future jokes are bound to be
nothing more than variations on a well-worn theme. A half hour of
``Nearly Departed'' is just about enough.

<HEAD>An Unknown Jerome Kern Musical Comes Back to New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine Andrew Lloyd Webber or Stephen Sondheim
not allowing songs from their latest musicals to be recorded or
played on the radio or performed in nightclubs and cabarets.
   Jerome Kern issued such an edict after the opening of ``Sitting
Pretty,'' his 1924 musical written with Guy Bolton and P.G.
Wodehouse.
   Why the ban?
   Kern was a man who wanted his music played the way he wrote it
and not jazzed up or distorted by popular renditions. He was a
perfectionist, although some musical comedy historians think the
prohibition may have been a ploy by Kern to create more interest in
the show.
   If it was, it didn't work. Despite generally good reviews, the
musical had a disappointing run of only 95 performances and
promptly was forgotten. Eight or nine of its songs were published,
but much of the score disappeared until it was unearthed in a
Secaucus, N.J., warehouse seven years ago.
   Now ``Sitting Pretty'' returns to New York for five performances
in a concert version at Carnegie Recital Hall (April 13 through
April 16). It will be conducted by John McGlinn, the man behind the
recent complete and critically praised recording of ``Show Boat.''
   The concerts, performed with a 23-piece orchestra and an
18-member cast, star Davis Gaines, Jason Graae, Kim Criswell and
Paige O'Hara.
   For McGlinn, ``Sitting Pretty'' is a labor of love, a chance to
perform a musical not heard in New York for 65 years.
   ``Nobody knows the score at all,'' said McGlinn who considers
the work an important transition piece, a bridge between Kern's
less serious, early musicals and his masterpiece, ``Show Boat.''
   ``Robert Russell Bennett, who orchestrated many of Kern's
musicals, would sometimes refer to `Sitting Pretty' in interviews,
saying that it was something that people someday should hear again
because it was special,'' he said.
   McGlinn first heard the music in 1980 when Bill Tynes of the New
Amsterdam Theater Company let McGlinn raid his sheet music
collection.
   ``It was so different and so beautiful, and on an emotional
plane so far removed from many of the other things Kern was writing
at the time,'' he said. ``This score has the deepest emotional
depth of anything he wrote until `Show Boat.'
   ``I don't know what part of himself Kern dug down into to create
this score, and I should say Wodehouse did as well because the
lyrics are as moving and emotional as a lot of the music.''
   The creators didn't get it from the frivolous plot, concocted by
Wodehouse and Bolton, which involves twin orphans who fall in love
with the real and adopted sons of a wealthy old man.
   ``It's extraordinary because there is this wild dichotomy
between the book and parts of the score which are really emotional
_ songs like `There Isn't One Girl,' `A Year From Today' and `The
Magic Train.' It's the real thing. When the music starts, playtime
stops,'' McGlinn said.
   ``I think it comes from the fact that Kern, by 1924, was ready
to flex his muscles. And when he saw opportunities to write truly
emotional music, he went for it.''
   ``Sitting Pretty'' remained unperformable until the Secaucus
discovery where a full score for the show as well as a lot of
Kern's working sketches were found.
   The Carnegie concerts will also include 95 percent of the show's
dialogue. McGlinn discovered a late draft of the script in the
Museum of the City of New York. Between that script, an early copy
filed at the Library of Congress in Washington and the full scores
found in Secaucus, he was able to piece together a book for the
performers to use.
   Kern has been a major preoccupation of McGlinn's for a long
time. In 1985, he did concert versions at Carnegie of Kern's ``Oh,
Boy!,'' ``Oh, Lady! Lady!!'' and ``Zip! Goes a Million.''
   Besides ``Show Boat,'' McGlinn has a recording of Kern
overtures, including ``Sitting Pretty,'' coming out in May on
EMI-Angel. He also has a complete version of Cole Porter's
``Anything Goes'' waiting for release on the same label. His other
upcoming projects include new recordings of Porter's ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' and possibly Irving Berlin's ``Annie Get Your Gun.''
   For the moment, though, he's concentrating on Kern and the
concert version of ``Sitting Pretty.''
   Musical comedy buffs will savor one number in particular, the
title song. It was dropped a week into the musical's original run
because leading man Dwight Frye had a minor speech impediment.
   When Frye sang, ``I like to sit, just sit and sit and sit, with
you the whole day through,'' it sounded, according to Kern
biographer Gerald Bordman ``embarrassingly different.'' McGlinn's
concerts should rescue the song.

<TEXT>
   Late-night assaults by teams of masked,
heavily armed bandits may be a hint of the high-tech crime of the
'90s. The crooks aren't after money _ their target is computer
chips.
   Five such robberies at Orange County, Calif., firms in six
months have authorities concerned about a new breed of bandit as
bold and brazen as jewel thieves, yet interested only in the tiny
components that give computers their smarts.
   ``When you think about the size of the chip and the value, the
loss can be pretty significant to a company. A person can walk off
with a bag of chips that can have more value than diamonds or other
gems,'' said Bruce Baker of Stanford Research Institute, a think
tank that keeps tabs on computer crimes.
   So far, the attacks have been limited to Orange County.
Authorities in other high-tech areas like Boston, Dallas, San Diego
and San Francisco report no similar thefts, though all have had
employees stealing chips from employers.
   Yet some authorities fear the high-tech crime wave is bound to
grow.
   ``This is the crime of the 1990s,'' said Los Angeles County
Deputy District Attorney Tony Castaneda, who is prosecuting three
men for reprogramming $1 chips for use in cellular telephones and
reselling them for $100 each.
   ``This is high-technology stuff. It's the type of crime that's
going to be prevalent in the 1990s, more sophisticated, more
technological.''
   In the most recent Orange County incident, four men in dark
clothing and toting machine guns, an assault rifle and a
.45-caliber pistol struck Advanced Logic Research at 10:30 p.m. on
March 3. Sticking a gun to a guard's head, the masked intruders
demanded entry to the Irvine computer firm just days after the firm
was in the news for developing a new computer.
   Nothing was stolen in the attack. ``Two cleaning women ran
upstairs and locked themselves in a room and screamed,'' said David
Kirkey, vice president of sales and marketing. ``The gunmen ran
out.''
   On Jan. 30, two armed bandits took $105,000 worth of dynamic
random-access memory chips from Western Digital Corp. after they
bound a guard. D-RAMs are the most common kind of computer memory
chip; they store information as an electrical charge and lose it
when the power supply is turned off.
   One week earlier, three men wearing combat fatigues and
brandishing rifles bound and blindfolded two guards at AST
Research. Police believe the bandits were after chips, but they
only made off with $9,000 worth of equipment.
   And on Nov. 24, two robbers armed with revolvers tied up a guard
at Holt Inc. and escaped with $100,000 in computer chips.
   Although the heists are similar, authorities believe two or
three groups of look-alike bandits are responsible, said Irvine
police Lt. Michael White.
   Ken Rosenblatt, a Santa Clara County deputy district attorney
specializing in high-tech crimes, said it's no surprise the thieves
are getting bolder.
   ``It's a sign of the times. People now have better access to
assault rifles. But it's a stupid way to steal them. It's sloppy. I
know of much better ways, but I'm not going to tell you,''
Rosenblatt said.
   The crooks are targeting two kinds of chips _ those used for
data processing and those with greater memory. As chips become more
sophisticated, with greater capacity in less space, they become
more valuable. They also are easier to steal, being the approximate
size of a dime.
   ``A megabyte chip costs about $10. A shopping bag full of 1,500
is worth $15,000. That's a lot of money,'' said John King, chairman
of the University of California, Irvine's Computer Science
Department. A megabyte is a million characters.
   ``A new chip with tremendous amount of capacity can be worth
multi-thousands of dollars,'' agreed Stanford's Baker.
   What makes the crimes frustrating is that the chips are hard to
trace. They all look about the same and don't have serial numbers,
only a stamped date of manufacture. That also leaves legitimate
businesses open to buying the stolen chips back without their
knowledge.
   ``If you pulled a person over who had a grocery bag of chips,
you couldn't tell where they got them from,'' said King.
   Law enforcement and computer experts suggest that the thieves
could be hired by smaller firms to cripple a competitor; the
average robber trying out a new market; or electronics experts who
will either steal an expensive chip's design and sell it cheaper or
build a cheap imitation.
   California's largest chip theft to date was in 1985. Larry E.
Lowery was sentenced to six years in prison for stealing $3.2
million in components from Silicon Valley's Monolithic Memories Inc.
   Baker believes the new crimes will continue. ``Whenever you have
a high-tech market, you have a big market, either legitimate or
black market.''
   King, however, says they are a ``flash in the pan'' because once
businesses hear of the thefts, they will make their chips harder to
steal. Generally, they have been stored behind priable mesh doors.
   ``I personally think it's a bizarre thing to steal. But it's
easier to conceal than an automobile and worth the same,'' King
said. ``It doesn't have anything traceable on it. And the first
couple of times you do it, no one is expecting it. No one would
expect a strong-armed robbery of a computer chip.''

<HEAD>Pollution in East Germany Extends Westward as Far as North Sea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEIPZIG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air and water pollution have
reached crisis proportions in East Germany, and Western experts say
pollutants are taking a heavy toll in West Germany as far as the
North Sea.
   West German officials are considering an offer of money and
technology to help the East German communist government clean it up.
   ``The water quality of the Elbe River is particularly critical
when it reaches West Germany,'' said Karl Huthmacher, a spokesman
for the West German Environmental Protection Ministry. ``Air
pollution has also reached dangerous levels.''
   The Greenpeace ecological group's West German branch said the
Elbe carries wastes to the North Sea, where ``plant and animal life
are seriously threatened and destroyed.''
   It also said human health is also increasingly at risk from
contaminated drinking water.
   In Leipzig and many East German cities, power plants using
high-sulphur brown coal belch out huge clouds of smoke that stings
the eyes and coats buildings with black soot. Heavy exhaust fumes
from cars, trucks and buses further foul the air.
   Western studies indicate that East Germany pumps more pollution
into the atmosphere than any other country in Europe, including
nearly 5 million tons a year of sulphur dioxide, according to West
German surveys.
   After the oil price rises in the 1970s, East Germany
increasingly turned to its considerable brown coal reserves.
   Statistics on the extent of pollution are not made public in
East Germany, but the government is under pressure to release them.
   An East German ecological group called the Green Network Arche
has demanded that the government ``stop treating evidence of
environmental pollution as state secrets.''
   Underground ecology newspapers detailing local pollution
problems are frequently seized.
   While East German officials have shown an increased willingless
to work with West Germany on environmental problems, Western
experts say they are still a long way from concrete and effective
measures.
   ``Working groups from both sides are still working to come up
with an acceptable program to help reduce the problems,'' said
Marlene Muehe, a spokeswoman for the West German Environmental
Ministry in Bonn.
   East German officials said at a recent environmental conference
in East Berlin that a number of new projects had been launched to
reduce river pollution and that the Elbe River would likely be
cleaned up by 1992.
   Hans Reichelt, East Germany's Minister for Environmental
Protection, was quoted in the state-run media as saying that all
new and refitted power plants would be equipped with filtration
devices beginning next year.
   But West German officials say that in order to make any
substantial progress soon, West Germany will have to provide the
East Germans with technology and financial assistance.
   While East Germany was the first Eastern European nation to
enact strict environmental laws, the guidelines are rarely
enforced, Western officials say.
   West German government studies indicate that cleanup tasks will
be difficult because East Germany has largely abandoned
environmental protection programs in recent years.
   ``The last two five-year plans have contained neither a detailed
environmental program nor funds to carry out projects outlined in
earlier plans,'' a West German government study said.
   ``Because of increasing economic pressures, East Germany has
made industrial growth and increased production a priority over
environmental protection.''
   West German officials, who are grappling with the heavily
industrialized nation's own formidable environmental problems, say
the East German pollution is of grave concern.
   ``Our own efforts to correct environmental problems are made
significantly more difficult because of the East German
pollutants,'' Environmental Protection Ministry spokesman
Huthmacher said in Bonn, referring to efforts to clean up the
nation's rivers and to reduce emissions that cause acid rain.
   West Germany's forests have suffered considerable damage because
of acid rain.
   Environmental experts also say East German factories dump tons
of untreated industrial wastes into waterways where it mixes with
the runoff from fields treated with nitrate fertilizers.
   Many major rivers flow into West Germany.
   According to Greenpeace, more than 100 tons of waste _ including
heavy metals, industrial sludge, raw sewage and pesticides _ flow
into the Elbe River each day in East Germany.

<HEAD>Antony Sher's ``Middlepost'': An Actor Turns Author</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not long ago, Antony Sher was being hailed as one
of the most exciting Shakespearean actors since Laurence Olivier.
   But instead of pursuing greatness on the stage, he switched to
literature, and ``Middlepost,'' his rangy and picaresque first
novel, represents the expatriate actor's emotional journey back to
his South African roots.
   ``The book is my coming-out as a South African,'' says Sher.
``I've been a closet South African for a long time; what I think is
healthy is that by writing the book, it feels much more comfortable
being myself.''
   That self refers to a protean talent by which an outsider has
managed to crack Britain's hermetic cultural circle. Both his
Richard III and his Shylock for the Royal Shakespeare Company were
revelatory interpretations that placed him at the top of the
English acting tradition.
   Sher acknowledges that during his two decades in England he has
worked very hard to become an Englishman, acquiring the tone and
mannerisms of a proper British accent.
   ``Middlepost,'' published last September in Britain and this
month in the United States, signals his attempt at the age of 39 to
come to terms with a country that could never fully be left behind
for the Cape Town-born grandson of Lithuanian immigrants.
   ``It has to do with the huge question mark that hangs over my
head, and I suppose over all the Jews of South Africa, really,'' he
said in an interview.
   ``At the time of the pogroms at the turn of the century when the
Jewish population evacuated Eastern Europe ... to those who went to
South Africa, it seemed history was playing a very, very cruel joke.
   ``It was inviting them to escape persecution and become the
persecutor.''
   Sher's first years in London were inauspicious. Rejected by two
leading drama schools, he attended the less prestigious Webber
Douglas and did provincial repertory.
   Not until 1982, and his ensuing affiliation with the RSC, did
the short, scruffy actor begin looking like a star. For his 1984-5
portrayal of the villainous Richard III, he hurtled around the
stage on crutches to capture the essence of Shakespeare's ``bottl'd
spider.''
   He played the role for 15 months in Stratford-upon-Avon and
London, and took it to Australia, stopping off in Middlepost to
research the novel.
   His ``Richard'' won him a commercial London run in Harvey
Fierstein's ``Torch Song Trilogy'' in which he played the
homosexual drag artist originated by Fierstein himself on Broadway.
   It was the first taste of above-the-title billing for an actor
who remembers 20 years ago being ``wide-eyed at this legendary
place of theater, staring at the names in lights there.''
   Back at the RSC he played Malvolio in ``Twelfth Night,'' Vindice
in Cyril Tourneur's ``The Revenger's Tragedy'' and in ``The
Merchant of Venice,'' a memorable Shylock whose full beard and
thick Jewish accent put to rest traditionally dry, classical
English approaches to this difficult part.
   Sher was already writing ``Middlepost,'' and he acknowledges
that his commitment to the book may have prompted the RSC to
sideline him.
   ``I didn't have time to get stuck in, so I got left out, and I
was angry,'' he said.
   ``My life seems constantly to surprise me. Three to four years
ago, if someone had said you'd be writing a novel, I would have
said, `I'm sorry; it's not in my plans.'''
   But as soon as he got the idea, the theme came very quickly.
``It must have been lying there.''
   Set in British-ruled South Africa in 1902, ``Middlepost'' is
about a Yiddish-speaking Lithuanian immigrant nicknamed Smous, the
Afrikaans word for peddler.
   Sher based Smous on his grandfather, a ``peddler who peddled his
way inland and ended up at this place called Middlepost.'' The tale
of Smous' discovery of self and country unfolds through the
characters he encounters, from the bushgirl Naoksa to the arrogant
Afrikaaner Breedt.
   Sher's family once owned Middlepost, a backwater town in the
Karoo Desert, and the novel's theme of alienation in a new land had
personal resonances.
   ``Smous' first day in Cape Town is like a lot of my early days
in London. They were incredibly bewildering, although I could speak
the language.''
   Having come to terms with his South Africanness through writing,
Sher now finds himself politicized. Last October, he organized a
benefit in London to raise money for victims of apartheid.
   Since leaving the stage, he has played Loki, a blacksmith's
dastardly apprentice, in Terry Jones' film ``Erik the Viking.''
It's his second movie following the little-seen 1985 ``Shadey.'' He
also has written a script for a BBC-TV telefilm, and plans a book
of his illustrations and a second novel, set in present-day England
and South Africa.

   As investigators hunt reasons for the Exxon
Valdez accident, The Associated Press traces blame for the nation's
worst oil spill back to the 1970s, when officials began dismantling
the very plan meant to prevent such a disaster. The story, reported
by Tad Bartimus, Hal Spencer and David Foster, all in Valdez, and
compiled by Scott McCartney in Anchorage, examines the shattered
promises, broken rules and ignored warning signs that played a far
larger role than a tanker captain's nighttime tippling.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>By The Associated Press</NOTE>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It takes grandiose vision and engineering
might to suck oil from the top of the world, load it a million
barrels at a time onto fat ocean-going barges and deliver it to
American gas tanks.
   The same kind of vision lets us turn atoms into electricity,
lets us fling rockets into space and bring them home again.
   In time, however, the miraculous and the dangerous become
routine. We say the worst can never happen, but the Three Mile
Island reactor nears meltdown, the space shuttle blows up.
   And the Exxon Valdez runs aground.
   The course for doom steered Good Friday morning by the Exxon
Valdez, with a liquored captain on board and an uncertified third
mate in command, was charted years before when restrictions were
relaxed, cleanup teams were disbanded and those in charge grew
overconfident their safeguards were enough.
   An examination by The Associated Press reveals a course charted
by greed, neglect, complacency, a depressed oil economy and a
strapped federal budget.
   Dozens of interviews with former officials and safety officers,
along with a study of state records and original contingency
proposals, indicate that a plan to avert a tanker tragedy was
develope a decade ago then gradually dismantled piece-by-piece.
   Protections lost in the last 10 years were as basic as keeping
harbor pilots onboard all the way into the Gulf of Alaska and
maintaining staff at the radar screens that keep an eye on tanker
traffic through Prince William Sound.
   What's more, warnings about drunken crewmen made as recently as
March 2 were ignored, failed drills were dismissed and a tanker
near-tragedy was written off as a one-time event.
   As investigators seek the causes of the nation's worst oil
spill, which has despoiled a lush wildlife habitat, perhaps for
years, they will find that decisions made by state and federal
officials and the oil industry bear far more scrutiny than the
drinks downed by Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, officials told the AP.
   ``We all allowed the grenade to be built. Hazelwood merely
pulled the pin,'' said Randy Bayliss, the official in charge of
state enforcement at Valdez until 1980.
   Factors include:
   _ Rejection by the Coast Guard and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.,
the consortium of eight oil giants in the Prudhoe Bay fields, of a
1976 state study that forecast tanker accidents and urged such
requirements as double-hulled tankers and tugboat escorts beyond
Bligh Reef. Last Thursday, Alyeska began tugboat escorts, saying
``a painful lesson had been learned.''
   _ Two cutbacks in recent years likely removed an extra pair of
eyes that might have spotted the off-course Valdez: In 1978, the
Coast Guard reduced the distance local pilots had to guide
departing tankers, and since 1984, the Coast Guard has cut its
radar staff in Valdez from 60 to 36, reduced the radar wattage and
decreased the required distance for radar monitoring. Two operators
on duty March 24 were not watching the Valdez because traffic was
light and the weather was fair.
   _ Disbandment in 1982 of the Emergency Response Team for
Alyeska, which has first-response duty for spills. Spill-fighting
equipment on hand was below the minimum required; even the barge
designated to carry containment booms and supplies was in dry dock.
Records Exxon filed with the state after the accident said
controlling the Valdez spill would have required 500,000 gallons of
chemical dispersant; when the tanker hit the reef, Exxon had only
3,795 gallons, and just 110,000 six days later.
   _ Carelessness by the state agency charged with keeping Alyeska
in compliance: The 1986 crash in oil prices forced state budget
cuts that reduced the work week at the Department of Environmental
Conservation to four days.
   _ A casual response by Alyeska and the Coast Guard to a
scientific determination that the Columbia Glacier would begin a
``drastic retreat'' in 1980, throwing icebergs into tanker lanes.
Alyeska said consequences for tankers would be minimal. The Coast
Guard promised to ``take whatever management and monitoring
measures necessary to ensure safety.'' Yet ice caused the Valdez to
alter its course _ and head directly for Bligh Reef.
   Jim Whaley, a technical specialist and ecologist for the Alaska
Pipeline Coordinator's Office from 1974 until 1980, vividly recalls
the debate over tanker safety during the volatile years of pipeline
construction and initial operation in the 1970s.
   Now director of the Joint Safety Center at the U.S. Marine Corps
base in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, Whaley said in a telephone interview
with the AP that he never shook off his concerns that Prince
William Sound would eventually suffer a major oil spill.
   Whaley, Bayliss, who was the DEC's Valdez supervisor from 1974
to 1980, and Virgil Keith, a tanker spill specialist hired as a
consultant by the state, were assigned to study shipping hazards in
1976.
   Their computer simulations predicted 20 accidents in 25 years. A
three-week practice operation in which the 120,000-ton Arco
Fairbanks was run through assorted situations provided little
reassurance.
   ``When the trials were over, all three of us were left with an
uneasy feeling,'' Whaley said. ``Our concern was to prevent the
catastrophe that has occurred. But during the trials we got a lot
of resistance,'' such as oil industry contentions that the studies
were flawed and that officials were overreacting.
   ``Alyeska and the Coast Guard exerted considerable pressure on
our requests for the tests to be conducted and about our concerns
regarding what might happen,'' Whaley said.
   Subsequently, the state proposed several safeguards, including
mandatory tug escorts, extended radar coverage and double-hulled
tankers.
   ``I wasn't prepared for such a totally negative response,'' the
state's pipeline coordinator, Charles Champion, said at the time.
Responding to oil industry criticism that he was ``asking loaded
questions,'' Champion retorted, ``Well, those are going to be
loaded ships.''

   Bayliss, now a private environmental engineering consultant,
said environmentalists didn't win many battles in the late 1970s.
   ``There were many, many safety disputes at that time, and in the
end the state and the environmental community got rolled,'' said
Bayliss.
   ``All of the wonderful safety controls the state and the
environmentalists wanted fell aside through attrition and constant
pressure from the oil industry.''
   Other missed warning signs were reports of drinking by tanker
crews. Valdez bartenders and townspeople say crews ``party all the
time,'' as one woman put it to Gov. Steve Cowper when he appeared
in Valdez the day after the spill.
   At a meeting with Alyeska officials March 2, three weeks before
the accident, Valdez residents repeated their concerns about crews
returning to tankers drunk, said Sally McAdoo, Valdez city
councilor.
   ``We told them, `We hope that you're paying close attention to
this. We may have a major catastrophe here.'''
   Spokeswoman Beverly Michaels said Alyeska was aware of community
concerns and was doing all it could to monitor crew sobriety. A
security checkpoint stops packaged alcohol at the gate, but tanker
captains are responsible for inebriated crew members.
   Officials said the erosion of safeguards didn't end with
measures to prevent accidents, but also extended to spill
preparedness.
   From 1979 to 1982, David Decker, 41, was a foreman for Alyeska's
emergency response team, a ``SWAT'' unit for oil spills.
   Alyeska gradually reduced the original 12-man crew, Decker told
the AP. Then, in 1982, it eliminated the contracted response team
completely, saying its duties would be handled by Alyeska employees
with other duties.
   ``They were obsessed with saving money,'' Decker asserted.
   He said his team could circle some ships with containment booms
in seven minutes. But even then, ``we kept reminding them we really
weren't prepared for something big,'' Decker said.
   ``Their mentality was that nothing big was going to happen.''
   Alyeska believes the personnel changes did not impair its
ability to repond to a spill, said Ms. Michaels. Although spill
response is handled by workers with other jobs, ``whatever tasks
they have can be put aside,'' she said. ``Their response is
immediate.''
   Yet it was 11 hours before the Exxon Valdez had a boom around
it, and that failed to hold. At most, Alyeska had 20,500 feet of
booms on hand, according to state records _ at least 12,000 less
than what was needed.
   Jim Woodle was Coast Guard commanding officer at Valdez from
1979 to 1982, when he retired to be Alyeska's superintendent of
marine operations for two years. Woodle said he witnessed the
dismantling of what had been ``a workable plan in 1977,'' including
a clean-up contractor who maintained a full inventory of equipment
and a ``dedicated team assigned to just oil spill response.''
   Even if fully prepared, Woodle noted, Alyeska could not have
contained this 10.1-million-gallon spill, but it could have made a
substantial dent.
   In November 1984, the DEC's district supervisor in Valdez, Tom
McCarty, attacked Alyeska's response in a drill. Booms sank or
weren't deployed properly, he said.
   ``A major spill can occur anytime, and Alyeska's spill response
activities have regressed to a dangerous level,'' McCarty wrote.
   In September 1985, a memo from DEC inspector Theresa Svancara
said terminal workers were unfamiliar with spill response equipment
and didn't know how to do their asigned tasks.
   Their drills were less than enthusiastic. In one, a hose to suck
up spilled oil was not fully deployed because an Alyeska supervisor
``said it would be too much work to roll it up again,'' Svancara's
memo said.
   DEC officials say preparedness has improved since then.
   Alyeska's ``Oil Spill Contingency Plan for Prince William
Sound'' requires that proper equipment be ready to move immediately
to a spill, and state environmental officials are charged with
ensuring the plan can be carried out. Last May, however, the DEC
missed an Alyeska drill. DEC district chief Dan Lawn said his
office wasn't notified until the day before and could not send
anyone on such short notice.
   Whaley said that before the pipeline opened in 1977, Alyeska
promised it could airlift within one hour all the oil boom,
transfer pumps and floating bladders necessary to collect oil.
   ``We were assured C-130 aircraft from around the nation would be
arriving into Valdez the very first day of the reported oil spill.
That was the plan that the state initially signed off on,'' Whaley
said.
   DEC commissioner Dennis Kelso acknowledged he and his
predecessors had allowed safeguards to erode. He blamed budget
cutbacks and departmental reorganization.
   ``Keep in mind that two years ago, after oil prices collapsed,
they had my department down to working four days a week,'' Kelso
said.
   Bayliss said he became convinced Jan. 17, 1980, that what would
happen on Bligh Reef nine years later was inevitable.
   That day a fully loaded tanker, the ``Prince William Sound,''
lost power in a 60-knot gale and 10-foot seas and drifted for 28
miles and 17 hours before restarting engines.
   ``The ship was 40 minutes and 1,500 yards from going aground and
breaking up in front of the Columbia Glacier in Prince William
Sound,'' Bayliss said. ``Everybody said it could never happen
again. They dodged a bullet that time. But this one got them.''
   Just as trust in reliable institutions died with the Three Mile
Island nuclear accident and the Challenger explosion, the grounding
of the Exxon Valdez has forever shattered the faith Alaskans placed
with the industry that made their state wealthy.
   Walter J. Hickel, former interior secretary, former governor and
a principal investor in a planned $10 billion natural gas pipeline
from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, said the oil industry simply misled the
public.
   ``The public was led to believe facilities were available to
contain the spill. It apparently wasn't true,'' said Hickel.
   But at the Sugar and Spice souvenir store in Valdez, they're
selling a T-shirt with a big red slash across a pointed finger and
a simple thought: ``It's Everybody's Fault.''

<TEXT>
   It was the kind of calm, clear night so
welcome in Prince William Sound because it is so rare. Across the
bay, the lights of Valdez twinkled as the mammoth tanker slipped
from its berth after filling its belly with more than a million
barrels of Alaska pipeline crude.
   On the fourth-story bridge of the Exxon Valdez' gleaming white
superstructure were skipper Joseph Hazelwood, several of his crew,
and Ed Murphy, one of the harbor pilots who routinely guide the big
ships through the tricky passage from Valdez into Prince William
Sound.
   Snow on the steep Chugach Mountains ringing the harbor cast a
faint glow in the inky darkness. The first hint of what passes for
spring in Alaska definitely was in the air that Thursday night.
   But before dawn, tragic mistakes would change Prince William
Sound, perhaps forever, and send environmental shock waves around
the globe. Before dawn, the captain would radio a gross
understatement, ``We're leaking oil. We're going to be here awhile.
I just wanted to make a report.'' Before two weeks were out, a
vast, often maligned cleanup effort would stagger out of control.
   Ed Murphy clambered over the side of the tanker onto a boat
headed back to port. By all accounts, the trip to that point had
been as uneventful as the thousands of others in nearly 12 years of
shipping oil out of Valdez.
   Hazelwood contacted the Coast Guard's traffic control center in
Valdez at 11:25 p.m., according to an initial transcript released
by a Coast Guard investigator.
   ``We are hooking up sea speed. Estimated time of arrival at
Naked Island 0100 (1 a.m.).''
   ``Roger that, sir,'' the Coast Guard replied, not tracking the
tanker on radar because traffic was so light and conditions were so
fine. ``Request updated ice report when you get down through
there.''
   The nearby Columbia Glacier regularly drops chunks of ice, some
as big as houses, that drift into the upper sound and the charted
shipping lanes.
   ``OK,'' Hazelwood replied, ``I was just about to tell you
judging from our radar we were just about to divert ... and end up
in the inbound lane if there is no conflicting traffic.''
   ``No reported traffic,'' the Coast Guard responded.
   Five minutes later, Hazelwood radioed he was altering course and
reducing speed to 12 knots. ``Winding my way through the ice,'' he
advised.
   It's not clear what happened next. Hazelwood seems to have set a
course directly for Bligh Reef. He didn't notify the Coast Guard of
the change, Coast Guard investigator Mark DeLozier told The
Anchorage Times. He left the bridge in command of Gregory Cousins,
a third mate not certified for those waters.
   All was calm until the five final frantic minutes, when the crew
tried to change course and avoid the outcropping of rocks lurking a
few dozen feet below.
   There followed what helmsman Robert Kagan later described as ``a
bumpy ride.'' Eight holes were ripped in the dark blue hull of the
2-year-old, $125 million ship, the pride of Exxon's U.S. fleet.
   According to the ship's log, the tanker came to a stop at 12:04
a.m., March 24, Good Friday.
   Hazelwood, who hadn't radioed in almost an hour, gave the Coast
Guard the news at 12:28 a.m.
   ``We've fetched hard aground,'' Hazelwood said. ``We're leaking
oil. We're going to be here awhile. I just wanted to make a
report.''
   Initial pollution report: ``Uncertain due to darkness.''
   Two minutes later, the Port of Valdez was closed to all traffic.
The tug Stalwart was dispatched to assist.
   By sunrise, oil was gurgling to the surface and the slick was
1,000 feet wide.
   Not until 11 a.m., more than twice the period promised in the
oil industry's spill response contingency plan, was a containment
boom snugged around the Exxon Valdez.
   Chemical dispersants applied to the slick at 6 p.m. did little
because the water was so calm. Two hours later, the tanker Exxon
Baton Rouge nestled alongside to begin pumping off the remaining
oil. By day's end, the spill was estimated at more than 10 million
gallons.
   The next evening, emergency workers tried to set the oil on fire
to burn it off, but the effort failed.
   On Sunday, the wind began to pick up, churning the slick into a
gooey mess covering more than 100 square miles and rendering all
containment and cleanup methods ineffective.
   Monday, the president of Exxon Shipping Co. conceded his company
was ``a little overwhelmed.'' Later that day, Exxon revealed that
Hazelwood had a history of alcohol problems, with two drunken
driving convictions in the previous five years. He had no
automobile driver's license.
   By this time, the oil was described as the consistency of
chocolate mousse. Reports of bird and animal contamination began
trickling in.
   Tuesday, March 28, the spill was moving ``like it's on a
superhighway,'' and the first animal deaths were confirmed. The oil
terminal in Valdez was reopened to restricted tanker traffic.
   Alarmed by the rapid spread of the oil toward vital hatcheries,
locals assembled a fleet of fishing boats to deploy containment
booms at the mouths of bays and harbors. Exxon's skimmers weren't
working.
   President Bush dispatched a team and two days later nixed the
idea of having the federal government take the management helm.
   Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost said he couldn't understand how
it happened. ``This is not treacherous in the area they went
aground,'' Yost said. ``It's 10 miles wide. Your children could
drive a tanker up through it.''
   Exxon fired Hazelwood after tests revealed his blood alcohol
content was above legal limits nine hours after the wreck.
   One week after, the iridescent menace had begun seeping into the
Gulf of Alaska, threatening more fishing communities and a national
park. Angry, frustrated fishermen and unemployed laborers broke up
an Exxon briefing, sending a federal bird expert from the podium in
tears.
   As March ended, state authorities filed criminal charges against
Hazelwood for operating the vessel while intoxicated, reckless
endangerment and negligent discharge of oil.
   The oil eventually spread over an area larger than Delaware, and
the toll of dead birds, sea otters and deer mounted steadily. Exxon
apologized to the world for the spill in full-page newspaper
advertisements.
   Last Wednesday, the tanker was refloated and moved to a remote
cove, a kind of public exorcism of a great evil.
   Hazelwood turned himself in that day, and posted bail Thursday.
   Two weeks after Good Friday, oil reached a national park, and
officials confirmed the obvious: the spill has grown so large only
nature's forces _ tides, winds and ocean currents _ will be able to
remove it.
   ``The oil is unmanageable,'' said Jim Hayden, the state's
cleanup coordinator. ``It's just immense. I don't think a spill
this size is controllable now.''

   A group led by former baseball commissioner
Peter V. Ueberroth has agreed to buy strike-crippled Eastern
Airlines for about $464 million. Union officials said they were
cautiously optimistic the deal could end the month-old walkout at
the nation's seventh-biggest airline.
   The deal, announced Thursday by Ueberroth and Texas Air Corp.
Chairman Frank Lorenzo, still must be approved by Eastern's major
creditors and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Furthermore, the deal requires Eastern to reach new work
agreements with its three unions _ which would get 30 percent
ownership of the airline in return for contract concessions _ by
next Tuesday.

   Taking advantage of strike-hobbled Eastern

announced plans to add 11 flights in Miami and 13 in the Caribbean

   The expansion, announced Thursday, had been part of American's
long-term planning, but the timing was pushed ahead by the
Machinists union strike that left Eastern flying only about 10
percent of its schedule since March 4.

   President Bush vowed anew to veto any attempt
to raise the hourly minimum wage higher than $4.25 as the Senate
nonetheless debated setting the base wage at $4.65.
   Democratic sponsors Thursday planned to amend their bill to
slash its final target to $4.55 an hour but still appeared headed
for a confrontation with Bush. They conceded, though, that his
support for some increase was a welcome change after the Reagan
administration's dogged opposition to any boost.

Thursday as reasons for the mediocre results at the cash registers

   The president and chief operating officer of
National Intergroup Inc., Laurence J. Farley, was fired after just
three months on the job, the company said.
   The conglomerate, which has interests in drug and oil
distribution and metals, said its board of directors accepted
Farley's resignation Thursday ``due to irreconcilable differences
concerning senior management responsibilities.''
   The board concluded ``the best interests of the company would be
served by his resignation,'' according to the company.
   NII spokesman Edward Klein refused further comment on Farley's
departure.
   Farley, reached Thursday night at his home, said the company's
statement was accurate. He declined further comment.
   The board named James S. Pasman Jr., 58, of San Francisco, as
Farley's successor.
   Pasman is former vice chairman of Aluminum Corp. of America and
former chairman and chief executive officer of KaiserTech Ltd. and
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp.
   Howard M. Love continues as NII's chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Farley, 52, was named NII's president and chief operating
officer on Jan. 1. He was a member of the board since last July and
joined the company in February 1988 as chief financial officer.
   Farley resigned as chairman of Black &amp; Decker Corp. in 1986.
   The company said the board ``expressed its high regard for Mr.
Farley's contributions and diligence.''
   Pasman currently is a member of the board of The Permian Corp.,
a firm in which NII holds a 43.7 percent interest.
   ``We are pleased to have Mr. Pasman's management and financial
experience working for us as we continue to implement NII's
long-term strategy,'' Love said.
   The board made no changes in the leadership of its key business
units, including FoxMeyer Drug Co., Ben Franklin and The Permian

<TEXT>
   When the Texas Air Corp. board met in Houston
last week, Peter V. Ueberroth assumed he had a done deal.
   But Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo's telephone call contained
news Ueberroth did not expect. Lorenzo said that hotel mogul Jay A.
Pritzker had made a higher offer.
   ``Peter told him `Congratulations. If I were you I'd take it,'''
a source familiar with the deal said.
   An hour later, Lorenzo called back and asked Ueberroth what he
was going to do.
   ``I'd take it,'' a source quoted Ueberroth as saying of
Pritzker's offer. ``I just told you an hour ago, we're history.''
   ``The thinking was that there was not less than a 50 percent
chance that there would be a deal,'' a source familiar with the
negotiations said.
   ``He used the Ueberroth negotiating strategy of a phantom bid,''
one Ueberroth friend said of Lorenzo.
   Ueberroth, according to friends, said he felt betrayed by
Lorenzo. He went home to California for his final day as baseball
commissioner and a weekend of golf.
   But by Monday, intermediaries got the two sides talking again.
And by Tuesday, according to several sources, Ueberroth's lawyers
and Texas Air officials were negotiating again.
   Henry Steinman of the New York law firm Latham &amp; Watkins headed
the Ueberroth negotiating team. By Tuesday afternoon, Ueberroth's
side thought a deal had been reached. Ueberroth returned to New
York on Tuesday night, and on Wednesday he began personal
negotiations with Lorenzo at Latham &amp; Watkins' offices.
   All through Wednesday, Ueberroth and Lorenzo stuggled with
details. Lorenzo's people claimed Ueberroth was nitpicking and
Ueberroth's people claimed Lorenzo was trying to change terms
previously agreed to.
   The sides argued about landing slots and gates at New York's
LaGuardia Airport. About the way notes receiveable would be
transfered from Eastern to Texas Air. Dozens of people went in and
out of the conference room during the talks, which began at 7:30
a.m. and continued until just before 8 p.m.
   On Thursday morning at 7:30, they went back at it. But in the
final stages, Ueberroth and Lorenzo did the negotiating one-on-one,
sources said. And at about 12:15, the two signed an agreement of
less than a dozen pages. The airline would be sold to a new
corporation, Eastern Airlines Employees and Service Company.
   About 90 minutes later, Lorenzo and Ueberroth walked to the
nearby Summit hotel. Ueberroth was wearing the same red-and-gray
paisley tie he wore Dec. 14 when he announced baseball's $1.06
billion four-year contract with CBS.
   It was about that time that Ueberroth had become interested in
Eastern, baseball sources said. Carl R. Pohlad, owner of baseball's
Minnesota Twins, also owned 12 percent of Jet Capital Corp., Texas
Air's holding company. With labor troubles coming up, Pohlad asked
Ueberroth if he would be interested.
   Ueberroth went to Miami and spoke with the pilots' union in
December. Not much happened until ealy March, when the Machinists'
union struck and pilots and flight attendants walked off in
support. Ueberroth sensed the opportunity.
   ``The bankruptcy indicated it was achievable,'' said Barry Rona
of the baseball owners' Player Relations Committee, one of the few
people willing to speak on the record. ``It became obvious as the
days went by that you were going to need new ownership and a new
management team to get the airline running again.''

   Peter V. Ueberroth brings to Eastern Airlines a
reputation as a no-nonsense manager and financial wizard
responsible for turning around ailing enterprises and honing his
public image in the process.
   That track record explains why the 1984 Olympics organizer and
former baseball commissioner agreed Thursday to buy a seemingly
hopeless airline beset by years of labor strife and $3.2 billion in
debt.
   ``It's certainly going to rank up there in attractiveness in
Peter's goals and aspirations, which is to take on a challenge,''
said Barry Rona, who heads the negotiating team for baseball's
owners.
   ``You can count on one thing, Peter will make money for
everyone,'' Rona added. ``If it turns out there are shareholders,
he'll make money for shareholders. His partners will make money,
the employees will make money and Peter will make money.''
   Eastern's last profitable quarter was in 1985 during an
industry-wide boom. Eastern since then has been hampered by labor
problems, its tarnished image and a corporate streamlining,
analysts said.
   ``We are not miracle workers at all in any way, shape or form,''
Ueberroth, 51, said at a news conference announcing the $464
million deal. ``I think most people will bet against us.''
   Ueberroth, who stepped down as baseball commissioner last
Saturday, isn't the first to take on the challenge of 60-year-old
Eastern.
   Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace, ran the airline
from 1935 until his ouster by Eastern's board in 1964. He built
Eastern into a major national carrier but made passenger
convenience a low priority.
   ``He was one of those typical old pioneers,'' said aviation
historian Robert Serling. ``Eastern reflected Rickenbacker's own
image _ tight-fisted but close to the vest, no-nonsense, to hell
with service.''
   Two other men led Eastern from 1964 to 1975, when former Apollo
8 astronaut Frank Borman took over the airline, but the airline
retained its reputation for bad service.
   As an Eastern vice president, Borman was known for visiting
workers from baggage handlers to flight attendants on the job. When
he became president, he turned to erasing the bad service image.
   ``He was the first airline chief executive who allowed himself
to become the symbol of the airline itself through television and
newspaper ads,'' said Serling, who collaborated on Borman's 1988
autobiography, ``Countdown.'' ``Long before Lee Iacocca did, Frank
was appearing in television commercials.''
   Borman began appearing on television about a year after taking
over Eastern, pledging Eastern's dedication to service. ``We have
to earn our wings every day,'' the slogan went.
   Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp., acquired Eastern in 1986
with the blessing of Eastern's unions, most of which had accepted
wage concessions to help the financially ailing carrier. The union
endorsement came even though Lorenzo had taken Continental Airlines
into bankruptcy court and broke its unions.
   Now comes Ueberroth, who was vice president of Trans
International Airlines for two years before he founded a travel
agency in Southern California in 1963, First Travel Corp.
   Ueberroth and his brother sold First Travel in 1979 to Carlson
Cos. of Minneapolis for $10.1 million. John Ueberroth ran it as
president of Carlson Travel Group, building it into the largest
travel agency operation in North America with $3.2 billion a year
in revenue.
   Ueberroth generated $230 million in profit as organizer of the
1984 Los Angeles Olympics and turned baseball's fortunes around
from a $67 million loss in 1983 to $100 million profit in 1988.
   During his term as commissioner, Ueberroth was the darling of
most of baseball's 26 owners, but less liked by players' union
officials, who claim he took credit for reviving the national
pastime where it wasn't necessarily due.
   ``He's an eyeball-to-eyeball guy. Everybody respected him,
considered him to be a great leader, though of him as being
intelligent,'' said Avron Fogelman, co-owner of the Kansas City
Royals. ``He was a step ahead of us all.
   ``And he did it very simply and did it without a lot of
adjectives. He used the most direct approach in dealing with
baseball owners as imaginable.''
   Marvin Miller, executive director of the Major League Baseball
Players Association for 17 years, accused Ueberroth of flipping
sides during 1984-85 in collective bargaining negotiations _ a sign
of his take-credit style.
   ``It's a public relations technique that says `When I started in
this job things were terrible,''' Miller said. ``Whether or not
that's true, you just say so. Then after a short while you say
everybody's making money. You don't have to add, `I turned it
around.'''

<HEAD>March Retailers' Results Varied</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Weakness in sales at some big chain stores may be more evidence
that consumers are losing their spending enthusiasm as overall
economic activity eases, analysts say.
   Reports Thursday from many of the nation's major general
merchandise, discount and apparel stores sent mixed signals about
the March performance.
   Opinions ranged from Sears, Roebuck and Co. saying its sales
were better than anticipated to K mart Corp. describing its volume
as disappointing.
   ``It's hard to look at these numbers and make any
generalizations,'' said Karen Sack of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
``It's kind of a mixed month. There are some good double-digit
numbers in there, though.''
   Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. said the chain
store sales were consistent with recent statistics showing a
moderation in growth.
   It was widely anticipated that consumer spending, which accounts
for about two-thirds of overall economic activity, would contract
in reaction to the increases in interest rates this year.
   Expenditures for costly items that are normally financed over
time already have fallen as indicated by the weak March auto sales
the car manufacturers reported earlier this week.
   Most analysts refused to attach too much significance to the
March numbers, preferring to defer judgment on the retail outlook
until April's sales are tallied.
   ``Realistically, we have to look at March and April combined to
get a good assessment of what's happening,'' said Jeffrey Edelman,
an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   For March, cold, stormy weather in parts of the country and the
loss of a selling day due to store closures for the Easter holiday
were cited as reasons for the mediocre results of several big
merchants.
   ``Sales during March were disappointing as colder-than-normal
weather adversely affected such key early spring businesses as our
outdoor garden shop, home improvement and ladies apparel,'' said K
mart Chairman Joseph E. Antonini.
   K mart, the second-largest U.S. retailer, said sales in the five
weeks ended March 29 were $2.42 billion, up 2.5 percent from $2.36
billion in March a year ago.
   Sales at K mart stores open for at least a year, called
comparable or same-store sales, slid 0.8 percent from the year-ago
level.
   Retailers and industry analysts say same-store sales give a
better reading of a company's performance than totals that include
sales at newly opened stores. Not every retailer reports same-store
sales.
   The biggest U.S. retailer, Sears, said sales were even better
than it hoped they would be in the month in which the company
introduced a new competitive pricing policy.
   Sears posted an 11.9 percent sales increase, to $2.97 billion
from $2.66 billion.
   Its same-store sales rose a healthy 9.6 percent and 15.4 percent
after adjustment for the loss of 2{ selling days due to Easter and
the closing of Sears' more than 800 stores nationwide for repricing
in preparation for the switch to an ``everyday low prices'' program.
   The gains at Sears may have cut into the sales growth at
competitors' stores, but analysts said it is too early to tell how
much of an impact Sears' new strategy is having.
   Elsewhere, specialty apparel retailers showed signs that the
sales rebound that began late last year has continued.
   Good results at stores such as the Gap Inc., Limited Inc. and
several department store chains, such as Neiman Marcus Group Inc.,
indicated current fashions were selling well.
   The figures released Thursday were from the biggest general
merchandise chains and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail
sales figures released by the government, they do not cover sales
at auto dealers, supermarkets or retaurants.
   Here are some of the results:
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the fast-growing discount and general
merchandise chain based in Bentonville, Ark., reported March sales
totaled $1.92 billion, up 26 percent from $1.53 billion in March
1988. Same-store sales rose 12 percent.
   J.C. Penney Co. said sales amounted to $1.233 billion in the
five weeks to April 1, up 0.7 percent from $1.225 billion a year
earlier. On a comparable store basis, sales fell 2 percent.
   Dayton Hudson Corp., a Minneapolis-based store operator, said
sales rose 6.4 percent in the five weeks ended April 1 to $1.1
billion from 1 billion. Comparable-store sales edged up 0.9 percent.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. said its domestic sales increased 5.4 percent
in the five weeks ended April 1 to $482 million from $457 million.
Domestic same-store sales rose 1.3 percent.
   Limited Inc.'s sales rose 15 percent in the five weeks ended
April 1 to $393.8 million from $343.3 million. Comparable store
sales were up 8 percent.

<HEAD>Sources: Boesky To Seek Early Release Due To Milken Indictment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Ivan F. Boesky plan to ask a
federal judge to reduce his three-year jail term on grounds that
the convicted inside trader's cooperation led to the indictment of
junk bond financier Michael Milken, sources say.
   Boesky became eligible for parole last month after one year in a
minimum security prison, but probably will seek early release from
the judge in Manhattan who sentenced him, not from prison
officials, an attorney involved in the case said Thursday.
   Attorneys will have to prove that Boesky should be rewarded for
providing information that led the government to Milken, the former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier charged last week with 98
counts of racketeering and securities fraud.
   Boesky's lawyers decided to wait to seek his release until after
the Milken indictment because they felt the judge and the prison
would not otherwise be sympathetic to freeing the man widely
considered the embodiment of Wall Street corruption in the
mid-1980s.
   ``A very big piece of his contribution which could not be
revealed now has been revealed,'' said the attorney, who asked not
to be named. ``That's the principal reason for the earlier delay.''
   Boesky was eligible for parole March 21, two days before his
one-year anniversary inside the Lompoc, Calif., prison camp where
the one-time stock speculator is working on a cleanup crew.
   In a plea for leniency, Boesky's attorneys in April 1988 filed a
request for U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker to reduce the
sentence on grounds that information Boesky gave prosecutors
unearthed other fraud cases, including the charges against Milken
and charges that led to a separate $650 million criminal plea deal
with Drexel.
   ``As these pending investigations mature into criminal and civil
charges, the extraordinary extent and value of Mr. Boesky's
cooperation will become even more evident than it was at
sentencing,'' the attorneys wrote at the time.
   They asked Lasker to wait until last October to hear the motion,
then requested another delay.
   ``It's likely that will be reactivated soon,'' the attorney
said, but did not specify when the request would be made.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird, who heads the Manhattan
U.S. attorney's office securities fraud division, declined to
comment on Boesky.
   Boesky, 52, paid $100 million in December 1986 to settle charges
by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he illegally used
inside information to profit from securities deals.
   He then cooperated in the government's wide-ranging probe of
white-collar Wall Street crime, supplying information used toward
civil or criminal charges in more than a dozen case in the United
States and Britain.
   In exchange, Boesky was allowed to plead guilty to one count of
conspiracy to lie to the SEC. Lasker in December 1987 sentenced him
to three years in jail. His earliest possible non-parole release
date based on good behavior is April 4, 1990.
   The next parole hearing at the 689-inmate Lompoc facility _
known as ``Club Fed'' because of recreational facilities including
tennis and boccie ball courts _ is set for May, prison spokesman
Gavin O'Connor said. Boesky's lawyers have not asked for his case
to be placed on the docket.
   Even if he remains a prisoner, Boesky still could be summoned to
testify as the main witness against Milken if that case goes to
trial. Milken has denied any wrongdoing and said he would fight the
charges against him.
   Many of the charges against Milken, who was placed on leave as
head of Drexel's high-yield bond division after the indictment,
center on deals allegedly made with Boesky involving takeovers,
stock manipulation and ``parking'' schemes to conceal securities
ownership.
   As part of his plea deal, Boesky agreed to cooperate with the
government. Sources said the government has not contacted his
attorneys yet about testifying at a Milken trial.

<HEAD>Deadline Could Threaten Drexel Settlement</HEAD>

   A criminal plea bargain by Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. could be jeopardized if the investment firm fails to
resolve separate civil charges with the Securities and Exchange
Commission by Monday, a prosecutor said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird said Thursday the government
does not plan a lengthy extension of the deadline, which already
has been extended several times.
   Failure to reach a pact would nullify the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office's landmark plea deal with the Wall Street
investment firm and raise the possibility of a far more serious
indictment on fraud and racketeering charges.
   Settling civil charges including insider trading brought by the
SEC last September was a precondition for Drexel's criminal plea
bargain three months later, under which it agreed to plead guilty
to six felonies and pay a record $650 million in fines and
restitution.
   If the deadline is not met or extended, the government could
bring a criminal indictment and force a trial of Drexel, which has
been under federal investigation for more than two years.
   Drexel agreed to the plea deal partly so it could avoid a
crippling indictment under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations act, which carries enormous fines and allows
prosecutors to seize assets before trial.
   Officials familiar with the SEC talks said a pact could be
approved by Monday or shortly thereafter.
   Baird, who heads the U.S. attorney's securities and commodities
fraud unit in Manhattan, said Drexel and the SEC initially agreed
to complete their negotiations Jan. 30, just six days after laying
out terms for negotiations.
   That deadline was extended several times by mutual consent of
prosecutors and Drexel as talks snagged.
   Baird said no discussions were planned to try to extend the
Monday deadline. If there is an extension, he said, ``it will be a
brief one.''
   Thomas Newkirk, SEC chief litigation counsel, declined to
comment on whether the deal could be reached by Monday.
   ``I think we're still hoping to have an agreement and we'll see
how it goes,'' Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said.
   One of the major obstacles in the agreement, designed to force
Drexel to crack down on internal policing, reportedly has been an
SEC demand that Drexel fire Michael Milken, architect of its junk
bond financing department that transformed the firm into a Wall
Street power.
   Milken took a leave of absence after he and two others were
charged March 29 with 98 counts of racketeering and securities
fraud, and his departure may satisfy the SEC. Drexel has a policy
that all indicted employees must be placed on leave.
   But Milken has undertaken a legal challenge to provisions of the
criminal settlement that require Drexel to fire him and withhold
his 1988 pay of more than $100 million. Milken claims it violates
his rights.
   Meanwhile, sources confirmed Thursday that David Solomon, chief
investment officer of Solomon Asset Management, is negotiating with
prosecutors to cooperate in the government's case against Milken.
   Solomon, whose firm manages about $1.5 billion in junk bond
investments, would be the first Drexel client to testify against
Milken should he become a witness. Several former Drexel employees
have testified against the firm in exchange for immunity during the
government's probe.

   Senate Democrats opened debate on a
minimum-wage bill by thanking President Bush for his support of an
increase but moving forward with their own plan after criticizing
the president's as too modest and his attitude as too reticent.
   ``Don't give us a take-it-or-leave-it proposal,'' Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said Thursday after Bush promised again to veto
any bill other than his. ``That's the kind of administration we've
had the last eight years. Confrontation. Confrontation.
Confrontation.''
   It appears, however, that a showdown is inevitable if not
imminent.
   Sponsors were hoping for a final vote today but were unable to
reach agreement with Republicans, meaning the debate likely will
extend into next week. Amendments lowering the final minimum wage
target to $4.55 from $4.65 and providing for a 60-day subminimum
wage for new workers were likely to be offered with the resumption
of debate today.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican floor leader, urged
Democrats to accept Bush's proposal as a compromise.
   ``President Bush has extended an opportunity to the Congress to
enact a minimum wage increase,'' Hatch said. ``In my opinion, it is
a worthy alternative to the proposal now before us.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. and chief sponsor of the Senate
bill, entered into a compromise with Southern Democrats over the
$4.55 top minimum that appears to give him more than enough votes
to win passage.
   Bush, however, appears to have the votes necessary to sustain a
veto.
   The amendments would bring the Senate bill in line with a
House-passed measure. Whether the bill would go straight to Bush
appears dependent on the Senate provisions for the subminimum. The
proposal being discussed late Thursday was slightly different from
what is in the House bill.
   The House-passed bill allows a subminimum to be paid to new
hires for two months but only if it was their first job. The
tentative Senate provision allows the subminimum to be paid to any
worker in that worker's first 60 days in the job market, regardless
of how many jobs the person held in that period. Both proposals
would abolish the subminimum in October 1992.
   Kennedy opened the debate by saying Bush's support for some
increase was a welcome change after the Reagan administration's
dogged opposition to any boost.
   ``Eight years of stonewalling against the minimum wage are
over,'' said Kennedy. Still, he said Bush's proposal ``gives too
little protection'' to the nation's low-wage workers.
   The minimum wage has been $3.35 since 1981.
   Both the House-passed bill and the amendments Kennedy promised
to support would raise the hourly minimum wage to $3.85 on Oct. 1,
to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year later.
   Bush's proposal calls for an increase to $3.65 on Jan. 1, 1990,
to $3.95 a year later and a final jump to $4.25 on Jan. 1, 1992.
The president's measure would allow employers to pay new workers
$3.35 an hour for their first six months. That subminimum would
rise to $3.40 an hour in 1992.

   Eastern Airlines strikers, calling their monthlong
walkout a victory, say they're ready to take pay cuts and get back
to work _ as long as it's without boss Frank Lorenzo at the
controls.
   Cautious union leaders, however, warned the strike won't end
until new contracts are signed. But most workers jubilantly greeted
the sale to a group including former baseball commissioner Peter
Ueberroth as a done deal _ even though it reportedly involves some
$210 million in union concessions.
   The $464 million agreement would give employees a 30 percent
share in the company in exchange for wage concessions. Eastern,
under parent company Texas Air Corp., had demanded $125 million in
wage and benefits cuts.
   ``This is better than winning the lottery, because 30,000 people
won it together,'' said flight attendant Alice Martinez. ``It's
wonderful.''
   She and her husband Jorge, an Eastern mechanic, said all the
workers know current wage levels will be dropping. Mechanics, for
example, earn a top wage of $18.83 an hour and ramp service workers
$15.60 an hour. Pay at Eastern's major competitors ranges from $16
to $20.10 an hour for mechanics and $15.51 to $17.45 for ramp
service workers.
   But though the cuts will hurt, they said, they would gladly
sacrifice to save the Miami-based airline without Texas Air
Chairman Lorenzo.
   Moreover, broader issues were at stake, Martinez said.
   ``Whatever happens here at Eastern is going to dictate what
happens with the rest of the airlines, and in other industries
too,'' he said. ``We had been stripped of our dignity while we were
working for Frank Lorenzo _ now we have it back, and we are going
to rebuild the airline.''
   Employees blamed Lorenzo's attitude toward workers, not wage
disputes, for the atmosphere of crisis that culminated in the March
4 strike by 8,500 workers, mostly mechanics and baggage handlers.
Most Eastern pilots and flight attendants have refused to cross
picket lines.
   Ken Walters, an Eastern pilot, expressed the strikers'
widespread admiration for Ueberroth.
   ``The first thing that came out of his mouth was he wanted to
share the airline with the workers,'' Walters said. ``The first
thing to come out of Lorenzo's mouth was `I don't talk to unions.'
''
   Stephanie Orent, a mechanic, said she knew the economic
sacrifices made during the strike would be hard to make up, but
said it was worth it despite the expected pay cuts.
   ``I don't know what it translates into in dollars and cents, but
we're willing to give,'' she said. ``We'll just tighten our belts.
We all want Eastern to survive, and we can't wait to get back to
work.''
   Ramp service worker Jose Lorie said the cost of the walkout was
not just economic.
   ``I've been hurt, my wife's been hurt, economically, emotionally
_ my nerves have been affected. And we know the airline has been
hurt _ how much, we'll have to find out,'' he said.
   He said he was a little taken aback about suddenly becoming an
owner of a company he has been on strike against.
   ``My feelings are confused,'' he said. ``But I feel a lot better
now that I'll be a part of the airline. It's like something extra.''
   Not everyone was ecstatic about the sale, with some saying they
want to see the fine print.
   ``I've seen so much deception that I'm not going to pick up my
tools until I've seen (the contract),'' said Julio Valentine, a
terminal maintenance worker for 23 years, who said he had emptied
his bank account since the strike began.
   But even Valentine said that if union leaders recommended it, he
would be willing to make concessions to Ueberroth.
   Pilot Sal Fallovallita said the strike had brought Eastern
workers together as never before, and the new team spirit would
help in rebuilding the airline.
   ``People go where they get a good product,'' he said. ``And
we're going to give them a good product.''

<HEAD>Beef Industry More Able to Ask, Where's the Fat?</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

   Two Texas A&amp;M scientists say the beef industry
has done well by reducing the amount of fat served consumers in
their steaks and hamburgers, but they warned that the job isn't
finished.
   H. Russell Cross and Jeff Savell said work continues on
resolving questions about fats and health, notably the dietary
linkage to high levels of blood cholesterol.
   Savell on Thursday told a conference sponsored by the National
Cattlemen's Association that if he had to send cattle producers and
the beef industry a note from the teacher, it might say:
``Excellent progress made in making product fit consumers' needs.
Keep working on leanness, convenience and cost, value. Remember to
maintain taste, or consumers will go elsewhere.''
   The beef industry drew praise from Jay Fletcher of the Community
Nutrition Institute, a citizens' interest group that conducts
research on nutrition and food policy issues. Fletcher agreed that
less fat is being sold to consumers.
   ``I think they have done more than many other industries to
recognize the dangers of excessive fat consumption and take steps
to inform consumers about that,'' Fletcher said in a telephone
interview.
   But selling meat is also a business, he said, and the beef
industry wants to recover the market share it has steadily lost to
chicken and poultry in general over the past 10 years.
   Fletcher said that occurred ``largely because of consumer
perception of beef as a high-fat food.''
   It was just a year ago that the Agriculture Department released
a study by Texas A&amp;M, led by Cross and Savell, that showed the
trimmable fat on retail cuts of beef had been reduced 27 percent in
two years.
   The $45,000 study, paid for by the beef industry and USDA,
showed that the average thickness of fat on steaks and roasts from
primal cuts, or the major wholesale cuts of beef, was 0.14 inch,
while the average for all cuts, from chuck roast to stew meat, was
0.11 inch, or less than one-eighth of an inch.
   Most retailers have been using a quarter-inch beef fat trim, or
less, since 1985, compared with a standard of half an inch before
that, according to the industry.
   At the conference, Cross said consumers have indicated they
would pay for more closely trimmed beef, preferably with external
fat of less than one-eighth inch.
   Internal fat, or marbling, has been a factor in the taste of
beef, and Cross said this still is important to consumers. The
challenge, he said, is to take fat off beef, not out of it.
   Cross said that Texas A&amp;M meat scientists are currently working
with medicine researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center on projects aimed
at further improvements in the healthfulness of beef.
   The work includes modification of the fatty acid content of meat
products through changes in cattle feeds and products themselves.
Fatty acids can potentially elevate cholestrol levels in human
blood. But Cross said that even now, only 27 percent of the total
fat in beef is the type of saturated fatty acid that can raise
cholesterol.
   Savell told of recent research on the composition of cooked as
well as raw beef with reduced or no external fat. For example, if a
slice of beef with all the fat trimmed off is cooked, the fat
content of the interior meat is reduced by 20 percent from a slice
with a quarter-inch layer of fat.
   That is because less fat migrates from the outside into the meat
tissue.
   ``When you trim the fat off a steak that has a half inch of fat,
you get rid of half the total cholesterol,'' Savell said.

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought more U.S. corn and that China has been sold wheat
at subsidized prices.
   Officials said Thursday the Soviet purchase was for 400,000
metric tons of corn to be delivered this year and that the wheat
sale to China was for 300,000 tons. Both deliveries are scheduled
for this year.
   More than 2.7 million tons have been purchased since the Soviets
resumed buying U.S. corn on March 28 after a layoff of almost three
months.
   The latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets for
1988-89 to almost 13 million tons. Additionally, sales include 4
million tons of wheat, 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.4 million tons
of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 400,000 tons of
corn would be about 15.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.45 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $39 million.
   John J. Reddington, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part
of 2 million tons authorized Feb. 27 for China under the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The latest sale boosted to about 8.5 million tons the amount of
wheat sold to China for 1988-89 delivery under EEP.
   Reddington said the latest sales were handled by Garnac Grain
Co. Inc., 50,000 tons; Bunge Corp., 50,000; Bartlett and Co.,
100,000; and Continental Grain Co., 100,000.
   He said the wheat will carry an average subsidy rate of $6.33
per ton, or about 17 cents a bushel. About 910,000 tons are still
available under the current authorization.
   The 300,000 tons would be about 11 million bushels and, at
recent prices of about $3.96 per bushel, would have a farm value of
around $44 million.

   The Justice Department says it will not oppose
the proposed merger of Time, Inc., and Warner Communications, Inc.,
to create the world's largest entertainment and media conglomerate.
   Assistant Attorney General Charles F. Rule said Thursday that a
month-long investigation of the proposed merger by the Justice
Department's antitrust division concluded that the merger would not
substantially lessen competition in any relevant market.
   ``What we know suggests the merger is not anti-competitive and
does not violate the law,'' said Rule, who is in charge of
antitrust division.
   The investigation began after the March 4 announcement by Time
and Warner of the stock swap that would create an $18 billion
company, combining the magazine publishing and cable television
operations of Time with Warner's recording and movie production
interests.
   Rule said the antitrust division carefully examined the possible
integration of Warner's movie and television production operations
with Time's cable-television distribution systems.
   Time operates HBO and Cinemax cable television networks. Warner
owns cable interests through Warner Cable Communications.
   Rule said the antitrust division did not object to the merger
even though it would enable the combined company to both produce
and distribute movies and television shows.
   A survey of the industry showed that a number of cable outlets
have exclusive relationships with movie studios. ``We didn't feel
this would substantially increase the exclusivity'' already in
place in the industry, Rule said.
   Showtime, another cable movie channel, started the exclusive
arrangements to enable it to compete more effectively against HBO,
Rule said.
   The department will continue to monitor the cable industry to
ensure that these arrangements do not result in restraint of trade,
he said.
   ``If there was harm to competition, we would have gone into
court to challenge the deal,'' he said.
   Rule said both companies must still get approval from local
cable franchising authorities.
   The conglomerate, Time-Warner Inc., is expected to have annual
revenues of $10 billion.
   If the merger is approved by shareholders, the combined company
would surpass Rupert Murdoch's Australia News Corp. as the world's
biggest media and entertainment conglomerate.
   Besides publishing Time, People and Sports Illustrated
magazines, Time owns Time-Life Books and the Book-of-the-Month Club.
   Warner operates Warner Brothers movie and television studios as
well as Warner Recording, which counts Madonna among its recording
artists.

<HEAD>Metzenbaum Launches Third Bid to Eliminate Antitrust Exemption</HEAD>

   Federal law should treat insurance companies
the same as other businesses, says a senator who is leading his
third charge against a special antitrust exemption for the industry.
   ``The case for repealing the insurance industry's antitrust
exemption is overwhelming,'' Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, told a
news conference Thursday. ``Insurance is vital to the nation. No
one can be secure without it. Yet those who provide it do not have
to comply with our national policy of free competition.''
   Metzenbaum said the Federal Trade Commission has been handcuffed
by the exemption, which makes it almost impossible to crack down on
misleading advertising or deceptive marketing practices.
   Though attempts to ax the antitrust immunity failed in the
previous two sessions of Congress, Metzenbaum said the chances of
repealing the McCarran-Ferguson Act have improved this year.
   ``The only question is, `What is the timing?''' he said. ``My
timing is now.''
   In February, the American Bar Association formally joined the
ranks of supporters and this week the insurance industry's biggest
rate-making organization bowed to pressure to stop distributing
advisory rates.
   Companies had tended to keep their rates fairly close to those
provided by the Insurance Services Office Inc., leading to
complaints that the advisory rates were akin to price-fixing. The
ISO's action is intended to squelch those complaints.
   Metzenbaum and Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who also appeared at the
news conference, stressed they were willing to negotiate with the
insurance industry on the final shape of the legislation.
   ``I don't think any harm would come to the insurance industry if
it went into effect word-for-word as Sen. Metzenbaum is introducing
it but neither he nor I nor anyone else is suggesting this is in
concrete,'' Simon said.
   David Pratt, the American Insurance Association's vice president
for federal affairs, said negotiation with Metzenbaum would be
pointless.
   ``We're not going to negotiate with him,'' Pratt said. ``I don't
think we'd get very far ... There's no agreement on the basic
premises.''
   Pratt said the so-called ``safe harbors'' in the bill that
shelter some combined endeavors would not work. ``They are
inefective in truly allowing for the joint activities we find vital
to make sure insurance is fairly priced,'' he said.
   Metzenbaum's bill would repeal the insurance industry's
antitrust exemption but allow states to continue individually to
regulate insurance. Under his bill, insurance companies would still
be able to work together, but joint activities would be limited to:
   _Collection and exchange of historical loss data and information
on fraudulent claims.
   _Research for classifying public fire defenses.
   _Preparation of standardized forms.
   The bill also would leave untouched joint underwriting,
state-required residual market mechanisms and pools ``that do not
unreasonably restrain trade.''
   Consumer, banking and small-business groups have been calling
for repeal or amendment of the industry's antitrust exemptions.
   A proposal in the House seeks to narrow those exemptions.
   A bill sponsored by Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., calls for a ban
on the sharing of information to determine premiums or coverage
areas.
   It also would forbid ``tie-in'' sales, such as a requirement
that a motorist buy a homeowner's policy with the auto policy, and
ban ``any action to impair the availability or affordability of
insurance.
   The insurance industry also opposes that measure, which a Florio
aide said ``has struck a nerve.''

<HEAD>American Adds 24 Flights In Eastern's Absence</HEAD>

   Taking advantage of Eastern Airlines' monthlong
absence from the regional market, American Airlines plans to add 11
flights in Miami and 13 in the Caribbean by June.
   American officials Thursday said the move resulted from
long-term planning by the airline, saying the strike by Eastern's
machinists union merely pushed ahead American's expansion program.
   The strike that started March 4 has reduced Eastern's service to
less than 10 percent of its normal daily flight roster.
   Thursday's announcement that Peter Ueberroth's group is buying
Eastern and plans to return the Miami-based carrier to full
operation appeared not to bother American's senior vice president
for operations, Robert Baker.
   ``The likelihood is that Eastern will still be the largest
carrier'' in the region, said Baker. ``None of what we have
announced today will rise and fall on what happens to Eastern
Airlines or anyone else.''
   American's new schedule raises the carrier's flights from 20 to
31 a day out of Miami and from 45 to 52 a day out of San Juan,
Puerto Rico.
   Baker said Eastern's troubles were not a major factor in the
expansion plans, noting that American announced last August _ long
before Eastern's labor-management showdown _ that it would install
a new crew base here.
   But Baker said American quickly decided to follow through on the
plan when the Eastern strike began March 4.

<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. is grumpy no more. It got an
apology and dropped its lawsuit over the use of a Snow White
look-alike in the opening of the Academy Awards.
   ``The academy sincerely apologizes to Disney for the
unauthorized use of Disney's copyrighted Snow White character and
for unintentionally creating the impression that Disney had ...
sanctioned the opening production number on the Academy Awards
telecast,'' Richard Kahn, president of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, said Thursday.
   Disney alleged in its suit filed in U.S. District Court that
Oscar producers lacked permission to use Disney's fairy tale
character.
   ``The lawsuit was filed, among other things, to remedy the
confusion surrounding Disney's perceived involvement with the
opening of the Academy Awards telecast,'' said Disney President
Frank Wells.
   In agreeing to drop the suit, Disney said there will be ``an
appropriate court stipulation in which the academy agrees not to
reuse the segment ... featuring Disney's Snow White for any
purpose.''
   Wells said last week the matter could have been settled without
litigation if the academy had publicly apologized after the show.
   ``For its own reasons, however, the academy unfortunately did
not accede to our request,'' Wells said.
   The spoof was created by Steve Silver, producer of the camp
``Beach Blanket Babylon'' revue which moved this week from Club
Fugazi in San Francisco to Las Vegas. Disney is also unhappy with
that production, which includes a Snow White character played by
the same actress.
   ``We haven't ignored it. We've had discussions and that's all I
can really say,'' said Disney spokesman Erwin Okun.
   No lawsuits have been filed against Silver so far, he said.
   The Oscars broadcast, seen in about 27 million American homes,
began with actress Eileen Bowman, dressed as Snow White, following
a chorus line of dancing stars into the Shrine Auditorium.
   In a squeaky Betty Boop voice, Bowman then launched into a
rendition of ``We Only Have Stars for You,'' to the tune of ``I
Only Have Eyes for You.'' She also sang a rendition of ``Proud
Mary'' with actor Rob Lowe.
   ``We pride ourselves on our meticulousness in obtaining the
proper legal clearances for all music, film and other material used
on our show and regret that we didn't do it with Disney,'' Kahn
said in his apology.
   ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' was released by Disney in
1937 and was the studio's first feature-length animated cartoon.
Critics praised the film, calling it a turning point in Disney's
career and a milestone in movie history.

<HEAD>Myths About Air Bags Abound, Despite High Public Support</HEAD>

   As the American auto industry prepares to
offer automatic restraints on all their cars, at least half of
America's drivers would fail a simple quiz about what air bags do,
a survey shows.
   Despite the lack of knowledge about the safety technology,
however, 62 percent of the adult licensed drivers who had heard of
air bags approved of their use, according to the survey released
Thursday by the American Coalition for Traffic Safety.
   Among the misconceptions about air bags widely held by American
drivers were these:
   _Seventy-one percent were moderately or very concerned that the
air bag might not inflate.
   _Sixty-six percent thought the air bag might inflate when it
shouldn't.
   _Fifty-seven percent were worried the air bag might block vision.
   _Forty-eight percent thought the air bag might pin them in their
car.
   _Twenty-two percent believed that kicking a car bumper could
make an air bag inflate.
   ``These myths and misconceptions reflect a knowledge gap that
must be filled,'' said Philip Haseltine, executive director of the
coalition, a lobbying group supported by the major automakers.
   The study, based on 1,500 interviews, found that only 11 percent
who knew what air bags were disapproved of them, and 22 percent had
no opinion. Five percent had never heard of air bags.
   ``I think it's difficult to educate the public about a
technology that's not available in large numbers,'' Haseltine said.
``I think it's not so much a matter of somebody falling down on the
job.''
   The public's knowledge of the passive restraints _ a term
unfamiliar to 49 percent of the people surveyed _ likely will
increase as such systems become more common in cars, Haseltine said.
   Cars sold in the United States beginning with the 1990 model
year must be equipped either with air bags, which inflate during a
frontal collision, or seat belts that automatically hook up when
the door is closed or the engine started.
   The nation's largest automaker, General Motors Corp., said this
week it will install driver-side air bags as standard equipment on
13 of its 1990 models.
   Ford Motor Co. plans to equip 11 of its 1990 models with air
bags, and Chrysler Corp., all of next year's models.
   Eighty-two percent of the people surveyed said they would keep
wearing safety belts even though their cars had air bags, and 65
percent said they believed auto insurers should reduce rates on
air-bag equipped vehicles.
   The American Coalition for Traffic Safety's survey was conducted
by telephone between March 20 and March 28, and had a 2.6 percent
margin of error.
   The organization's members include the Big Three U.S. automakers
and American Honda Motor Corp.

<HEAD>USDA Says Wait and See on Drought Relief for Winter Wheat Growers</HEAD>

   The Agriculture Department says it's premature
to move forward with a drought assistance package for winter wheat
farmers, but members of Congress are ignoring the advice.
   Legislation was introduced Thursday in the House to make federal
aid available to winter wheat growers by extending drought programs
enacted last year.
   USDA has said the 1989 crop of winter wheat, the bread-making
wheat planted last fall but not harvested until this year, doesn't
qualify for any of the $3.9 billion in drought assistance approved
in 1988.
   At a hearing of a House Agriculture subcommittee, top USDA
officials maintained a wait-and-see approach to dry weather
persisting in parts of the country, particularly the major winter
wheat-growing states of Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, southern Nebraska
and eastern Colorado.
   ``We don't know there is going to be a widespread disaster,''
said Ewen M. Wilson, USDA's assistant secretary for economics. ``We
will have to monitor the situation and see if it rains and see how
bad it is.''
   In fact, a ``highly tentative'' projection by USDA suggests
total wheat production might rebound 35 percent from last year's
drought-stricken harvest, making it the biggest crop since 1984.
   The agency's response frustrated and angered members of the
committee, who fear that wheat states might end up without the kind
of assistance provided last year to corn belt farmers. They took
pains to note that in 1988, a presidential election year, USDA was
quick to agree with the need for drought relief.
   ``We know there is going to be a disaster. We know people are
going to be affected,'' said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla. ``The only
question is how many.''
   Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who introduced the new drought aid
measure, said: ``We are suffering. We were able to work with corn
country last year. It is our time.''
   According to USDA, the winter wheat outlook is especially gloomy
in Kansas, traditionally the nation's largest producer. At the
start of the month, 70 percent of the Kansas wheat crop was rated
poor to very poor. Kansas normally accounts for 17 percent of total
U.S. wheat production and 35 percent of the nation's hard red
winter wheat.
   The prospect of a damaged harvest comes at a time when global
wheat supplies are at their lowest point in 15 years.
   A private agricultural analyst, John Schnittker, warned the
subcommittee that poor U.S. crops in 1989 would further shrink
grain stockpiles and pose ``a serious threat to world food
sufficiency and price stability.''
   Wilson conceded that drought could sharply reduce winter wheat
harvests in some areas but he and another USDA official held out
hope that spring rains might rescue part of the crop.
   Norton Strommen, USDA's chief meteorologist, said the next 30 to
60 days would be critical. The 90-day weather outlook suggests near
normal rainfall in much of the wheat belt across the Great Plains
although below normal rainfall is expected in the short term.
   Because the winter wheat crop is developing later than usual,
Strommen said, ``we have a mixed picture.''
   ``It's just a little premature to start to write the crop down
to any specific level,'' said Strommen. ``We simply have to watch
and wait for the development and the timing and distribution of
rainfall in the next two months.''

   U.S. and Soviet Union officials will meet
April 26 to open semiannual discussions about the long-term grain
agreement between the two countries, the Agriculture Department
says.
   The meetings are required under the pact, which was extended
after negotiations last year. The agreement specifies that the
Soviet Union will buy a minimum quantity of wheat and corn from the
United States each year.
   The department said Thursday that the meetings in Washington
``will include a review of the worldwide, U.S. and Soviet grain
situations and the status of purchases and shipments under the
agreement.''

   The White House is showing new flexibility on
taxes but agreement with Congress on any specifics is not imminent,
the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee says.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said Thursday, that Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and President Bush's budget director
Richard Darman indicated in a meeting that the president would
accept modifications of his plan to cut the capital gains tax rate
and other tax proposals in his fiscal 1990 budget.
   But the capital gains plan, which the administration claims
would raise $4.8 billion next year, still stood little chance of
passage, Bentsen said.
   ``There is great disagreement on which taxes to raise, or user
fees as the administration prefers,'' said Bentsen. ``We have a lot
of negotiating to do on that and I'm not sure how it will come
out,'' Bentsen said.
   The Gramm-Rudman law mandates reducing the deficit to $100
billion in fiscal 1990, which would require about $28 billion in
new revenues or in spending restraint, according to White House
estimates.
   Bentsen said there was widespread agreement that about $14
billion in new revenues will be included in a budget package this
year. That includes not only about $5.6 billion in taxes, but sales
of government assets, user fees, and increased enforcement of
existing taxes.
   Brady and Darman declined to comment on whether the White House
was revising the $14 billion in revenues in its fiscal 1990 budget.
   Bentsen said the administration ``absolutely'' could find
revenue-raising ideas that Congress would accept. But he did not
offer any specifics, and said he doubted any would be nailed down
soon.
   ``No way they are going to get that (agreement by today) on the
revenue side,'' he said.
   The meeting with Bentsen was one of a series of visits Brady and
Darman have had with senior members of the House and Senate
tax-writing committees. They also continued talks with
congressional budget-writers on an overall spending and revenue
framework for the new fiscal year which begins Oct. 1.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said Thursday's discussions focused on spending
restraint on entitlement programs, including agriculture subsidies.
   Panetta said he was still hopeful a broad consensus could be
reached on Friday, but he softened his talk of moving ahead
immediately with his own package in his committee if the
negotiations drag on.
   ``I'm hopeful, but I think there's also a chance that we are
going to slip into next week,'' he said.

   The Treasury Department's No. 2 official,
Deputy Secretary M. Peter McPherson, is leaving the agency to
become an executive vice president of Bank of America.
   The departure of McPherson, who had been deputy secretary since
August 1987, was expected. President Bush in February announced
plans to nominate John E. Robson, dean of the business school and a
professor of business management at Emory University, to succeed
McPherson.
   McPherson had served as acting treasury secretary between the
departure of James Baker III last August and the confirmation of
Nicholas Brady in September. From 1981 to 1987, he served as
administrator of the Agency for International Development and as
chairman of the board of the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
   The department said Thursday that McPherson would serve as Bank
of America's director of debt restructuring and have responsibility
for all the bank's negotiations on Third World debt.

<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices in Western Europe rose a hefty
0.5 percent in February, raising the annual average inflation rate
to 5 percent, the highest in 37 months, the EEC statistics agency
Eurostat said Friday.
   The 5 percent annual rate was up from 4.8 percent in January,
when consumer prices rose an average 0.7 percent in the 12 European
Economic Community nations, Eurostat reported.
   February's price hikes lifted the EEC annual inflation rate past
that of the United States, which ended February with an annual rate
of 4.8 percent after having been above the EEC level since April
1987.
   In February prices rose most sharply in Portugal, 1.4 percent;
Italy 0.8 percent; and Britain 0.7 percent, Eurostat said.
   February's price rises were `` more moderate in Belgium (up 0.4
percent), in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg (all up
0.3 percent) and in Spain (up 0.2 percent),'' it added.
   ``The Greek index showed a decrease of (0.4 percent) owing to
the winter sales of clothing and footwear.''
   Eurostat provided these annual inflation rates for the EEC
nations individually:
   The Netherlands, 1 percent; West Germany and Belgium, both 2.6
percent; Luxembourg, 2.7 percent; Ireland, 3.3 percent; France, 3.4
percent; Denmark, 4.4 percent; Italy, 6.1 percent; Spain, 6.2
percent; Great Britain, 7.8 percent; Portugal, 12.1 percent and
Greece, 13.8 percent.
   It gave these corresponding rates for non-EEC nations:
Switzerland and Austria, both 2.3 percent; Norway, 4.9 percent;
Sweden, 6.4 percent and Finland, 6 percent.

<HEAD>Coleco Board Approves New Reorganization Plan, Decides Not To Sell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GORDON FAIRCLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of Coleco
Industries Inc., once one of the nation's largest toy companies,
has dropped plans to sell the company in a reversal of an earlier
decision.
   The reversal was made as the board voted to amend its bankruptcy
reorganization plan to head off complaints that the company is not
offering its unsecured creditors adequate compensation.
   Morton E. Handel, chairman of Coleco's board of directors, said
the board decided against pursuing a sale of the company on the
grounds that maintaining Coleco ``as an independent, ongoing
business is in the best interests of the creditors and
shareholders.''
   In February, the board of directors had authorized management to
explore selling Coleco as a means of solving its financial problems.
   The new reorganization plan, announced Thursday, ``is intended
to satisfy the needs expressed by the unsecured creditors'' during
bankruptcy proceedings in New York federal court, Handel stated.
   The Avon, Conn.-based company, which makes Cabbage Patch dolls
and other toys, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in July 1988.
   Coleco's unsecured creditors have criticized a reorganization
plan filed by the company in January, saying it did not offer them
enough.
   U.S. District Judge Prudence B. Abram, who is presiding over the
bankruptcy proceedings, said last month Coleco should not be
surprised that most creditors objected strongly to the original
plan. Abram said, ``I can't think of another plan where I've seen
the unsecured creditors so wholly wiped out as they are in this
case''
   The board of directors said the amended version would
``represent a substantial improvement for the unsecured
creditors,'' who include bondholders, manufacturers and advertising
agencies. Coleco owes them more than $400 million.
   Under the proposed amendment, which must be approved by the
federal bankruptcy court, the unsecured creditors will receive
stock in Coleco, giving them ownership of about 37 percent of the
company.
   Handel said the unsecured creditors will also receive a package
of ``other securities, cash, notes and other debt instruments.''
Handel said the package will be worth about $40 million, or 10
cents per dollar of their claims.
   The amendment also calls for the secured creditors, those first
in line for repayment, to convert their current claim of about $80
million into Coleco common stock, giving them 60 percent ownership
of the company.
   The remaining approximately 3 percent of the company will stay
in the hands of current owners of preferred and common stock.
   Handel said the proposal has been approved by the secured
creditors, New York financiers Isaac Perlmutter and Bernard Marden.
He said it would be submitted to the bankruptcy court in New York
before April 25.

<HEAD>Malaysia Airlines To Buy Boeing Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its single largest deal,
government-owned Malaysia Airlines will buy at least 16 U.S.-made
Boeing 737 jetliners for about $400 million, the airline's managing
director said Friday.
   The purchase is part of the airline's expansion and
modernization program, Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahman told reporters after
signing an agreement with Singer Link Miles Co. of Britain to buy a
Boeing 737-400 flight simulator.
   The deal would involve 10 Boeing 737-400 aircraft and six or
seven 737-500 aircraft, Aziz said. The new planes will replace the
airline's 12 aging Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
   He said Malaysia Airlines is expected to sign a purchase
agreement with Seattle-based Boeing Co. next month. The aircraft
are expected to be delivered by 1992, he said.
   The purchase of the flight simulator will enable pilots to
become familiar with the plane before the airline takes delivery of
the aircraft, Aziz said.
   The airline's Boeing 737-200 jets, which have been in service
since 1972, are no longer produced by Boeing, and Malaysia Airlines
is expected to auction them off to other airlines.
   Separately, the carrier recently signed an agreement with
International Lease Finance Corp. of California to lease seven new
Boeing 737-400 planes for delivery between 1990 and July 1991.

   Acme Boot's elephant-skin boots will
vanish from stores by mid-summer as production of the $200-a-pair
footwear ceases because of possible poaching in Africa.
   Acme, the world's largest boot manufacturer, dropped the line of
casual boots this week after several years of production. The
60-year-old company continues to make footwear from the skins of
exotic creatures including the ostrich, snake, lizard, alligator
and eel.
   Acme, based in Clarksville, Tenn., said its purchases of African
elephant hides, made through an importer, were legal. But special
interest groups had questioned the treatment of elephants by others.
   ``We have seen increased concern by environmentalists and
consumer groups about illegal poaching for tusks, not for hides,''
said Bill Whitlock, Acme vice president of marketing.
   ``They have run ads showing grotesque pictures,'' he said
Thursday. ``This drew our concern. We thought it best to
disassociate ourselves with it in general even though this involved
tusks and not hides.''
   No special interest groups had contacted Acme about dropping the
line. ``There was no pressure,'' Whitlock said.
   The elephant-skin boots, which were dyed mostly in light colors
to fit a casual image, accounted for less than 1 percent of Acme's
total production.
   ``The boots are very masculine, rugged looking,'' Whitlock said.
``They were tough; they wore well and had a long life. They went
well with jeans.''
   Acme, which employs 2,200, has plants in Clarksville and
Waverly, Tenn.,; El Paso, Texas, and Corcoran, Mass.

   A congressional panel rejected an attempt to
force Texas and other states with lax regulations to help pay for
the savings and loan mess, a provision one member said would have
started a ``second Civil War.''
   Meeting as regulatory agencies made two announcements
underscoring the urgency of swift action, the House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions on Thursday also decided to
permit regulators to charge higher deposit insurance premiums to
institutions engaged in speculative lending.
   By a 27-20 vote, the subcommittee authorized the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., if it chooses, to levy higher premiums against
S&amp;Ls and banks making high-risk investments.
   The Bush administration opposes the measure. It is trying to
prevent delay of its S&amp;L rescue package by deferring ticklish
deposit insurance issues until the completion of an 18-month study.
   The FDIC said it took over 38 institutions, bringing the total
number of S&amp;Ls under its supervision to 215 in 31 states. The
agency is attempting to hold losses down at the sickest S&amp;Ls until
Congress appropriates the money to close or merge them.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the industry
suffered $9.4 billion in withdrawals in February, the 10th
consecutive month of outflows and down only slightly from the $10.6
billion record in January.
   The House subcommittee, in the first of three scheduled all-day
sessions, slogged through 48 of 165 proposed amendments, adopting
two that would increase the power of the FDIC over S&amp;Ls and deny
the Bush administration some of the political control it had sought
over the agency.
   But it was a push by Northern legislators to force Texas,
California, Florida and other states with lax regulation of
state-chartered S&amp;Ls to pay part of the bailout cost that generated
the most heated debate.
   The panel voted 39-7 against an amendment sponsored by Reps.
Paul E. Kanjorski, D-Pa., and Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, requiring
states with high numbers of state-chartered thrift failures to
contribute 20 percent of the cost of bailing them out.
   The measure drew considerable sympathy, but committee members
argued against it for political reasons.
   ``This would have sent the bill to Fort Sumter. It would have
started the second Civil War,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said
after the vote.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, argued that attaching punitive measures
to the S&amp;L bill could draw a veto from President Bush: ``All I ask
the people here is, with this provision, is there a slight chance
that a Texan in the White House will sign it?''
   Kanjorski and Kaptur argued that Texas will get the lion's share
of the bailout, $31 billion, representing $1,856 for every man,
woman and child in the state, while most other states will pay more
than they get, $479 per capita in Connecticut, for instance.
   ``What we are involved in here ... is the most mammoth transfer
of resources from many regions of the country to one region of the
country in the history of the republic. Everything else done by the
government pales in comparison,'' said Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y.
   However, Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, said the measure was
unconstitutional, arguing, ``This is an excellent amendment for
those who wish to vent anger, but it is bad law.''
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the full banking
panel, called the amendment an ``outlandish'' and ``shoddily
written concoction.''
   The FDIC was one of the big winners in Thursday's session. It
won support on a 35-12 vote for an amendment giving it, rather than
the Federal Home Loan Bank System, primary authority over
state-chartered S&amp;Ls.
   The measure was sponsored by Leach, who intended it as a rebuke
to the bank system. S&amp;Ls' chief lobby group, the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions, said in a letter Thursday that they oppose a
similar measure before the Senate Banking Committee.
   In a move to secure the political independence of the FDIC, the
House panel provided fixed four-year terms to its chairman and vice
chairman. The Bush administration had proposed that the chairman
serve at the pleasure of the president. It also increased the
FDIC's borrowing limit.
   Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee concluded three days of
behind-closed-door meetings intended to smooth the way for a full
Senate vote the week of April 17. The House subcommittee plans to
finish its version of the bill next week.

   The head of Exxon says he's not going to
follow Japanese precedent and resign or kill himself over the
Alaska oil spill.
   In Senate hearings on the disaster Thursday, Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., said that after Japanese disasters, ``everyone takes
responsibility, from the individual up to the CEO.''
   He then told Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl, ``I think your
resignation is in order.''
   Rawl said he disagreed and added, ``A lot of Japanese kill
themselves also _ and I refuse to do that.''

   The stock market headed lower today in response
to what analysts described as an ambiguous report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .55 to 2,291.42
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in natiownide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 308 up, 600
down and 503 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.39 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the unemployment
rate declined to 5.0 percent, a new 15-year low, in March, from 5.1
percent the month before. That surprised analysts, who had been
looking for a small increase.
   By contrast, the data also showed a smaller-than-expected gain
of 180,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, providing some support
for the view that the economy has been slowing since early this
year.
   Brokers said the overall result was something of a letdown,
however, since many investors had been hoping for a more clear-cut
signal that pressures were abating on inflation and interest rates.
   That left stocks in the same listless, drifting pattern that
prevailed for the past several sessions while traders awaited the
employment figures.
   Exxon dropped ] to 42| in active trading. The stock has been
under intermittent pressure since the March 24 accident involving
an Exxon tanker that resulted in a huge oil spill near Valdez,
Alaska.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.10 to 165.92. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .33 at 329.75.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 12.83
points to 2,291.97.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 566 up, 830 down and 549 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 146.53 million shares, against 165.88
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>35 Indicted, De Benedetti Cleared In Banking Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Magistrates investigating Italy's biggest
post-war banking scandal indicted 35 people Friday but cleared
financier Carlo De Benedetti of any wrongdoing in the collapse of
Banco Ambrosiano.
   Licio Gelli, a financier accused of masterminding a ring of
rightwing terrorism, subversion and spying, was among 34 people
indicted on charges of complicity in fradulent bankruptcy.
   The indictments also named Gelli's aide Umberto Ortolani, an
Italian-born banker now living in Brazil, financier Anna Bonomi
Bolchini, 23 board members and officials of the bank and eight
other Italian businessmen. One woman was indicted for currency
violations.
   No truak date was announced.
   The indictments stem from the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano,
Italy's biggest private bank. It failed when it could not collect
$1.3 billion in loans made to 10 dummy companies in Latin America
controlled by the Vatican Bank.
   The Vatican Bank, officially known as the Institute for
Religious Works, was the largest shareholder in Banco Ambrosiano.
It agreed in 1984 to pay $250 million as part of Banco Ambrosiano's
bankruptcy settlement but said the payment was not an admission of
responsibility.
   Italian courts ruled last year that a treaty between the Vatican
and Italy prevents the prosecution of the Vatican Bank, American
Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, and two other top officials of that bank.
   De Benedetti, who failed last year in a highly publicized
attempt to take over the Belgian group Societe Generale De
Belgique, was notified in July 1987 that he was under investigation
for his sale of Banco Ambrosiano shares shortly before it went
bankrupt.
   However, the magistrates said Friday there was no evidence of
any wrongdoing by De Benedetti, whose financial empire includes the
Olivetti computer group and the Mondadori publishing house.
   ``I always expressed my total serenity in this area because I
had full knowledge of not only having always acted in the full
respect of the law but also of having exercised my duties as
administrator with determination and transparency,'' De Benedetti
said Friday.
   Gelli was the grandmaster of the P2 (Propaganda Due) Masonic
Lodge that investigators linked to crimes that included tax
evasion, bribery and conspiracy to topple the government. He also
was charged in connection with the 1980 bombing of the Bologna
train station that killed 85 people and injured 200 but wasn't
brought to trial.
   He was extradited to Italy from Switzerland last year on
condition that he could be tried only on charges related to the
collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.

   A judge ruled partially in favor of Texas
billionaire H. Ross Perot in a breach of contract suit brought by
the company he founded but later sold, allowing him to continue
operating his new Perot Systems Co. provided he makes no profit.
   The ruling on Thursday by Fairfax Circuit Court Judge William
Plummer followed four hours of debate by attorneys representing
Perot and Electronic Data Systems, the company based in Plano,
Texas, he had founded.
   Attorneys for EDS described Perot as ``resolved to ruin'' his
former company. EDS is trying to stop Perot from operating his
company and from recruiting employees away from EDS.
   Perot's lawyers replied that EDS was overstating his contractual
obligations to his former company and was laying legal traps to
hold off a feared business adversary.
   Plummer left a final decision on the recruiting issue for Monday
when the trial reconvenes, but he gave an opinion on the matter
Thursday that seemed to be a compromise.
   The judge said Perot may recruit from among his former EDS
colleagues _ but only those who were employed by the company before
December 1986, when a non-competition contract between the two
firms was signed. The usual contract prohibiting employees from
joining a competing enterprise would be waived in the case of Perot
Systems, because the contract acknowledged their special allegiance
to Perot, the judge said.
   EDS claimed Perot had intended to recruit from within its ranks
``in perpetuity'' _ luring away the company's best talent even
after the non-competition contract lapses in December.
   It said Perot already has raided EDS of 150 to 200 employees,
including eight executives.

<TEXT>
   Permitting random drug tests of employees is
``going off the deep end a little bit'' to fight the drug crisis,
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said.
   In a lecture Thursday at the University of Georgia School of
Law, Scalia called the U.S. Constitution ``not only the token but
indeed the substance of what continues to bind us together as a
people.'' But he said the document will last ``only as long as it
endures in the hearts and minds of the people.''
   He said the court is merely a reflection of society and its
beliefs. And he warned that opposition to drugs could erode
people's rights.
   ``We are facing a particular crisis. ... I feel we have gone off
the deep end a little to meet that crisis,'' Scalia said.
   ``If society continues to feel that way 50 or 60 years from now,
you are going to have justices on the court who were plucked from
that society,'' he said. ``I can't save you from yourselves.''
   Scalia, a conservative named to the high court in 1986 by
then-President Reagan, wrote a stinging dissent in a Supreme Court
decision in March upholding drug testing for some U.S. Customs
officers, though in another case decided at the same time he backed
tests for railway workers after accidents.
   He was greeted at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport by a
handful of anti-bortion demonstrators but left via a side exit.
   In Athens, a small group favoring legal abortions stood quietly
outside the auditorium holding a banner reading, ``We won't go
back.''

<HEAD>Is `Stagflation' Setting In?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When they talk about the economic outlook these
days, many Wall Street analysts use a term coined in the 1970s but
not heard much since then: ``Stagflation.''
   The word, a hybrid of stagnation and inflation, describes an
unpleasant set of circumstances once believed to be nearly
impossible.
   In a period of stagflation, economic growth is weak at best, but
inflation keeps running at the kind of rapid pace that is supposed
to occur only in times of strong expansion.
   That condition prevailed for extended periods in the '70s amid a
series of unusual influences, including a runaway rise in world oil
prices and a couple of long and severe recessions.
   The precise causes of stagflation in those days are still being
debated. But lately a more urgent question has been raised. After a
decade of strong growth and relatively low inflation, is
stagflation coming back?
   Most analysts believe that growth of economic activity has begun
to slow since early this year under the influence of a sustained
period of credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   Short-term interest rates, at 9 percent-plus, stand more than 3
percentage points higher than they were a year ago. That means that
for many borrowers the cost of money has been increased by about 50
percent.
   Yet some gauges of inflationary pressures have increased,
suggesting that the cost of living is now rising at an annual rate
in the 5 percent to 6 percent range.
   Despite those symptoms, however, most observers don't believe
the economy is about to come down with a sustained case of
stagflation.
   ``Recent signs of slower economic growth and an escalation of
inflation are typical for this stage of a business cycle,''
maintains Jack Lavery, research chief at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ``The
conditions for a prolonged period of stagflation appear to be
absent.
   ``We expect economic growth to slow on balance for the rest of
the year. The momentum of inflation should start to abate shortly
after the economy weakens.''
   Wright Investors' Service Inc., which recently lowered its
estimates for economic growth and corporate profits through 1990,
takes a similar view.
   ``Inflation is probably now close to its peak rate for the
current business cycle,'' say analysts at the Bridgeport, Conn.,
money management firm.
   By next year, Wright says, inflation is likely to set no more
than a 4 percent annual pace _ ``even lower if the economy falls
into a genuine recession.''
   At Nomura Securities International Inc., economists David Resler
and Carol Stone declare, ``we attach a small probability to the
stagflation scenario.
   ``At its heart, stagflation pertains to an environment where the
costs of essential production inputs are rising rapidly and
retarding productivity.
   ``In the 1970s, that condition was first triggered by the 1973
oil embargo. Though oil prices have risen recently, a replay of
anything like those earlier episodes seems improbable.
   ``A brief period of rising inflation and falling economic growth
is more likely. Reduced growth may be necessary to alleviate
strains on production capacity.
   ``But that also eases inflationary pressures, so the conditions
of stagflation should be short-lived.''

   Representatives of Peter V. Ueberroth today
met with Eastern Airlines' unions hoping to clear another hurdle in
the proposed sale of the strike-crippled carrier _ the former
baseball commissioner's demand for wage and other concesssions from
the workers.
   Ueberroth met informally with union officials Thursday night and
formal negotiations began today at the headquarters of the
International Association of Machinists, which struck the airline a
month ago.
   An IAM spokeswoman said the meeting began at 9:30 a.m. and was
expected to last all day. She said she did not believe Ueberroth
himself was at the session, which also involves unions representing
Eastern's pilots and flight attendants, which have honored IAM
pickets.
   The talks came a day after a group led by Ueberroth agreed to
buy strikebound Eastern for about $464 million. The deal would give
Eastern's 30,000 employees a 30 percent stake in the airline in
exchange for about $210 million in contract concessions.
   Union officials said they hoped the deal could end the month-old
walkout at the nation's seventh-largest airline and get Eastern
flying a full schedule.
   But some daunting hurdles remain for the deal, announced by
Ueberroth and Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.
   Eastern's major creditors and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court must
approve it. In addition, the deal requires Eastern to reach new
work agreements with its three unions by midnight Tuesday.
   Ueberroth's group is seeking about $210 million in pay cuts and
work-rule concessions from the unions, sources close to the
situation said. Lorenzo had sought $125 million in concessions.
   ``Under this agreement Eastern can be back flying in very short
order,'' Lorenzo said at the news conference. ``Eastern is prepared
to be back flying within 24 hours ... after agreement is reached
with the unions.''
   The Miami-based carrier has been virtually grounded since March
4 by the machinists' strike that was supported by pilots and flight
attendants and drove Eastern to file for bankruptcy protection and
reorganization on March 9.
   ``To sum it up, it's a mammoth challenge,'' said Ueberroth, who
organized the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. ``I'm convinced
that there is a spirit amongst the people in the company that I can
help bring together to help this airline.''
   Although Texas Air has endorsed the Ueberroth plan, others still
might submit competing proposals to the bankruptcy court.
   Nevertheless, the Ueberroth deal was greeted with cheers by
union members, who have vilified Lorenzo as a union buster.
   At a crowded union hall in Miami, members chanted ``Hey, hey!
Ho, ho! Lorenzo's got to go'' and sang ``Take Me Out To The
Ballgame'' as they heard of the sale.
   Union leaders were more cautious.
   ``We're reviewing the documents and we'll be making a decision
very shortly,'' said Charles Bryan, head of the machinists' local
at Eastern, who was in Washington for the talks with Ueberroth.
   Jack Bavis, chairman of Eastern's pilots union, said his group
was encouraged by the development and looked forward to working
with Ueberroth.
   In New York, Lorenzo told reporters that under the proposed
purchase Texas Air would get about $200 million cash, would be
forgiven $185 million that it owes to Eastern and would get $79
million worth of Eastern assets.
   A union analysis, on the other hand, reckons the value of Texas
Air debt owed to Eastern at $288.6 million. The debt includes loans
to Texas Air and Eastern's sister carrier, Continental Airlines, to
buy gates at airports in Newark, N.J., Houston and Cleveland, and
for aircraft purchases.
   Eastern is saddled with about $3.2 billion in debt.
   The $79 million in asset transfers _ which the unions have
vocally opposed _would include Eastern's New York-Montreal route
plus eight landing slots and one gate at New York's LaGuardia
Airport as well as $28 million in unspecified assets.
   Ueberroth and partner Thomas Talbot, a former airline executive
from California, would own 30 percent of the airline.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a major investment house, and
Ardshiel Inc., a smaller New York firm, would sell securities to
investors for the remaining 40 percent of Eastern.
   Eastern would get a 19.9 percent interest in Texas Air's
computer reservations system, System One, as well as Continental's
Miami-London route.
   Ueberroth said his group also would receive proceeds of
Eastern's $365 million sale of its profitable Northeast shuttle to
developer Donald J. Trump. The bankruptcy court must approve that
sale, too.
   Lorenzo said Eastern intended to file a bankruptcy
reorganization plan that would pay creditors 100 percent. Lorenzo
will remain in charge of the airline until the deal is approved,
but Ueberroth will participate in formulating the reorganization
plan.
   Ueberroth's group made a $464 million offer for Eastern last
week but withdrew the bid after Texas Air said it had been topped
by another buyer, identified by sources as billionaire hotel
executive Jay A. Pritzker.
   Takeover strategist Carl Icahn, the wner and chairman of Trans
World Airlines Inc., has publicly expressed interest in Eastern and
gained the support of its unions but has yet to make a formal offer.

   The OPEC nations produced about 19.6
million barrels of oil a day in March, slightly under the level of
February but still ahead of their output targets, according to
estimates released Friday.
   The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil Market
Report that estimated production by the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries slipped about 200,000 barrels a day
last month.
   Total output was estimated at 19.8 million barrels a day in
February and 20.2 million barrels in January.
   The OPEC countries agreed in November to reduce their output to
18.5 million barrels a day in the first half of this year from more
than 22 million in an effort to push up prices.
   Since the accord, prices have rallied more than expected,
surpassing OPEC's target of $18 a barrel. The average price of a
basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC reached $18.57 a barrel
this week.
   A panel of eight OPEC ministers met last week in Vienna and
reaffirmed their commitment to the accord.
   All 13 ministers will meet in early June to decide the output
levels for the second half of the year. Observers have said the
ministers would likely boost the production ceiling if prices held
at their current levels.
   The report by the International Energy Agency estimated world
oil supply _ outside such centrally planned economies as the Soviet
Union _ at 50 million barrels a day in March, about the same as in
the previous month.
   The oil tanker accident off the Port of Valdez reduced
production in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay to 800,000 from 2 million
barrels a day, the report said.
   ``Shipping is being resumed on a limited basis, which if it
continues should restore Alaskan supplies to normal levels in the
near future,'' it said.
   It said production in industrialized nations belonging to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development registered
about 16.4 million barrels a day last month, up 200,000 barrels
from February. About two-dozen developed nations, including the
United States, belong to the OECD.
   The report said oil consumption by those industrialized nations
in the first quarter of this year was 38 million barrels a day, up
1.6 percent from the first three months of 1988.
   ``In North America,'' it said, ``there was moderate consumption
growth in most products, with jet fuel growth very strong.''
   Consumption increased in Japan, it said, because of strong
economic growth.
   For all of this year, the report estimated oil consumption in
the industrialized nations would increase by less than 2 percent.
Most of the gain, it said, would likely be in fuel used in
transportation.

<HEAD>Three-Month T-Bill Takes Spotlight In First Quarter</HEAD>

   Inflation fears drove up interest rates and
depressed most of the credit markets during the first quarter, but
three-month Treasury bills and junk bonds stood out among the pack,
analysts say.
   A quarterly analysis by Moody's Investors Service Inc. released
this past week found that high-yield, high-risk ``junk'' bonds had
the best rate of return in the January-March period, roughly 2.2
percent.
   Three-month T-bills had almost as good a return: 2.1 percent
return.
   But junk bonds contain a risk of default that must be factored
in when considering their return, said John Lonski, a senior
economist with the securities-rating firm.
   ``One would have to say that the superior performance adjusted
for risk unquestionably belonged to the three-month Treasury
bill,'' Lonski said.
   By comparison, investment-grade corporate bonds provided a
return of about 1.4 percent; and long-term Treasuries, those of
7-30 years maturity, 1.1 percent.
   A separate index of government and corporate bonds compiled by
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. showed a total return of 1.1 percent in
the quarter.
   The rate of return includes accrued interest plus any capital
gains through price increases.
   Investors that fared best during the quarter followed a
so-called ``barbell strategy,'' which calls for concentrating
investments on the two extremes of the spectrum, short-term bills
and long-term bonds, according to James L. Kochan, chief
fixed-income strategist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   The plan paid off during the first quarter because short-term
rates jumped while prices of long-term bonds held up fairly well,
he said.
   Three-month Treasury bills yielded 8.39 percent on Jan. 3, the
first trading day of the year. On March 31, they yielded 9.18
percent.
   The 30-year Treasury yielded 9.08 percent on Jan. 3, and 9.09
percent on March 31, though it fluctuated many times due to
economic news that jolted the market.
   Prices and yields on bonds move in opposite directions, so a
high yield means a low price.
   The situation in which the yield on the three-month T-bill
surpasses the 30-year Treasury bond's yield is what Wall Street
calls an ``inverted yield curve.''
   The yield curve, which illustrates the difference between
short-and long-term interest rates, normally slopes upward to the
right, with longer-maturing issues yielding more than shorter
issues to reflect the risk of keeping money tied up.
   But short-term rates rose during the quarter amid concerns that
worsening inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income
securities, would lead to further credit tightening by the Federal
Reserve.
   An inverted yield curve is sometimes viewed as an early warning
of a recession because it means shorter rates have risen so high
that they could choke off economic growth.
   The inflation news during the first quarter brought concern
among the credit markets. The government reported that wholesale
prices rose 1 percent in January and February.
   Since then, several other government-issued economic reports
have indicated the economy might be slowing, easing fears of
inflation and adding a lift to the credit markets.
   Prices of long-term bonds have risen back to the range
prevailing before the March 17 figures, indicating a high degree of
resiliency in the bond market, Kochan said.
   ``It's extraordinary, really. It's probably performing better
than any of us had any right to expect,'' said Kochan.

   Wheat futures prices were lower and soybeans and
other grain prices were mixed early today on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Reports that farmers have been holding onto their corn and news
that the Soviet Union has bought 400,000 metric tons of U.S. corn
buttressed futures trading in that product, analysts said.
   Rain and a forecast for more rain on the drought-stricken
farmlands of Kansas weighed on wheat prices, they said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 3{ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.97 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to } cent higher, with May at $2.66\ a bushel; oats were \ cent to

   In early trading, cattle were .10 cent higher to .30 cent lower,
with the contract for delivery in April at 77.77 cents a pound,
feeder cattle were .10 cent to .87 cent lower, with April at 77.80

   President Bush said today he had ``no
intention of budging one inch'' from his minimum-wage proposal as
Senate Democrats moved forward with their plan to raise the base
wage higher than Bush has said he will support.
   It was the second veto threat from the president in as many
days, and Bush's clearest statement about the fate of the
Democrat-sponsored plan if it reached his desk.
   ``We fired our best shot and last shot and only shot first,''
Bush said at a meeting with reporters. ``I have no inention of
budging one inch on this. I have too much at stake.''
   That drew fire from one leading supporter of the Senate
Democrats' plan, as debate on it resumed today.
   ``Don't give us a take-it-or-leave-it proposal,'' said Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. ``That's the kind of administration
we've had the last eight years. Confrontation. Confrontation.
Confrontation.''
   Sponsors were hoping for a final vote today but were unable to
reach agreement with Republicans, meaning the debate likely will
extend into next week. Amendments lowering the final minimum wage
target to $4.55 from $4.65 and providing for a 60-day subminimum
wage for new workers were likely to be offered with the resumption
of debate today.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican floor leader, urged
Democrats to accept Bush's proposal as a compromise.
   ``President Bush has extended an opportunity to the Congress to
enact a minimum wage increase,'' Hatch said. ``In my opinion, it is
a worthy alternative to the proposal now before us.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. and chief sponsor of the Senate
bill, entered into a compromise with Southern Democrats over the
$4.55 top minimum that appears to give him more than enough votes
to win passage.
   Bush, however, appears to have the votes necessary to sustain a
veto.
   The amendments would bring the Senate bill in line with a
House-passed measure. Whether the bill would go straight to Bush
appears dependent on the Senate provisions for the subminimum. The
proposal being discussed late Thursday was slightly different from
what is in the House bill.
   The House-passed bill allows a subminimum to be paid to new
hires for two months but only if it was their first job. The
tentative Senate provision allows the subminimum to be paid to any
worker in that worker's first 60 days in the job market, regardless
of how many jobs the person held in that period. Both proposals
would abolish the subminimum in October 1992.
   Kennedy opened the debate by saying Bush's support for some
increase was a welcome change after the Reagan administration's
dogged opposition to any boost.
   ``Eight years of stonewalling against the minimum wage are
over,'' said Kennedy. Still, he said Bush's proposal ``gives too
little protection'' to the nation's low-wage workers.
   The minimum wage has been $3.35 since 1981.
   Both the House-passed bill and the amendments Kennedy promised
to support would raise the hourly minimum wage to $3.85 on Oct. 1,
to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year later.
   Bush's proposal calls for an increase to $3.65 on Jan. 1, 1990,
to $3.95 a year later and a final jump to $4.25 on Jan. 1, 1992.
The president's measure would allow employers to pay new workers
$3.35 an hour for their first six months. That subminimum would
rise to $3.40 an hour in 1992.

   Attempts to produce low-tech nuclear fusion, which
electrified the scientific world when announced two weeks ago, have
produced no cries of success and at least one apparent failure.
   A University of Utah scientist and a British colleague touched
off a scramble when they described creating nuclear fusion in a jar
of heavy water. They said the process generated four times more
power than it used.
   If true, their technique could revolutionize power production,
yielding a steady supply of cheap, clean electricity. But neither
they nor anyone else has offered a convincing explanation of the
principles of physics involved.
   At Massachusetts Institute of Technology, chemist Mark S.
Wrighton said he obtained technical details from University of Utah
officials and started a duplicate experiment. It has been going
continuously since March 27 with no evidence of nuclear fusion, he
said Thursday.
   Spokesmen at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
Livermore, Cal., and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los
Alamos, N.M. said their attempts at duplicating the work have not
produced conclusive results.
   Wrighton said he was ``very skeptical'' of the Utah claim, as
was John Deutch, MIT's provost.
   ``It would be terrific if it's true, but I don't think it's
true,'' Deutch said.
   Wrighton said his lack of results could mean that the technique
does not work. But it could also mean that the fusion is so slight
that it cannot be detected, or the reaction may need more time to
occur.
   The fusion feat was announced at a news conference by B. Stanley
Pons of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of the University of
Southampton in England. They claimed to have achieved nuclear
fusion at room temperature with equipment available in any college
lab.
   Late last week, Wrighton and several other research groups
around the country received copies of the team's scientific paper,
which he said confirmed that he had been doing the experiment just
as they had.
   ``We see no physical basis at the moment for thinking that
nuclear fusion is going to occur,'' Wrighton said, ``and we
certainly have no evidence that there's a big effect, one that
would have technological consequences in the near term.''
   Pons was in meetings all day Thursday and could not be reached
for comment on the MIT experiment, his office said. University of
Utah spokeswoman Pamela Fogle noted that Pons and Fleischmann
believe the reaction can take 10 days to three weeks to occur.
   On Thursday, researchers from the Los Alamos laboratory met with
Pons to discuss his research, the Deseret News in Salt Lake City
reported.
   Utah legislators were to meet today in special session to
consider allocating $5 million to develop and commercialize fusion
research. However, the State Board of Regents says the funds should
be used only when the fusion research is confirmed.
   The researchers' paper has been published in the Netherlands in
the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry.
   ``We realize that the results reported here raise more questions
than they provide answers and that much further work is required on
this topic,'' they wrote.
   Wrighton said some attempts to duplicate the work began even
before the University of Utah news conference as word of the
discovery began to leak out.
   ``We understand through the grapevine that the groups going that
long haven't seen any confirmation of the essential claims,
either,'' he said.
   Last week, Steven Jones of Brigham Young University said he had
independently performed a similar experiment last year but obtained
far less impressive output than the Utah team.
   Scientists at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y.,
have tried to duplicate Jones' approach in two experiments. One
produced nothing, and the other turned up results too small to be
statistically meaningful, spokeswoman Mona Rowe said Thursday.
   Fusion is the energy source that powers the sun and hydrogen
bombs. The energy produced by nuclear power plants comes from
fission, which splits atoms. During fusion, they are joined
together.
   Ordinarily fusion requires hundreds of millions of degrees of
heat. But Pons and Fleischmann said they produced fusion energy in
a 6-inch glass jar at room temperature and normal pressure. Their
equipment included a six-volt battery, rods of the precious metal
palladium and heavy water, or water with deuterium.

   The stock market struggled to a small gain today
following what analysts described as an ambiguous report on
employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.87 to 2,297.84 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 652 up, 568 down and
563 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the unemployment
rate declined to 5.0 percent, a new 15-year low, in March, from 5.1
percent the month before. That surprised analysts, who had been
looking for a small increase.
   By contrast, the data also showed a smaller-than-expected gain
of 180,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, providing some support
for the view that the economy has been slowing since early this
year.
   Brokers said the overall result was something of a letdown,
however, since many investors had been hoping for a more clear-cut
signal that pressures were abating on inflation and interest rates.
   That left stocks in the same listless, drifting pattern that
prevailed for the past several sessions while traders awaited the
employment figures.
   The strongest buying showed up in the recently depressed
technology sector. International Business Machines rose 1| to 109|;
Digital Equipment 1] to 97]; Honeywell 2] to 73\; Hewlett-Packard
1{ to 53\, and Apple Computer, traded in the over-the-counter
market, 1 to 37.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.49 to 166.51. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .09 at 329.99.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 73.49 million shares at
noontime, against 70.55 million at the same point Thursday.

   Trade negotiators from more than 100 countries
reached an agreement in principle Friday on agricultural subsidies,
officials said.
   Informal talks resolved remaining disputes on European Economic
Community farm subsidies and the issue of ``food security,'' the
officials said.
   ``The book is closed on agriculture. We have reached an
accord,'' chief EC farm negotiator Guy Legras told a press
conference.
   But he added that ``an enormous amount of work'' remains in
continuing world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade. He predicted ``intense and difficult'' negotiations over
the next 1{ years.
   The tentative accord, which delegates were expected to approve
formally later Friday, calls for an overall cap on farm supports
and import barriers through 1990, Legras and other officials said.
   It also calls for countries to reduce their subsidies in 1990
but does not specify by how much, chief Canadian negotiator Germain
Denis said.
   The pact meets a Community demand of letting the European
trading bloc bring up in future negotiations the issue of
redistributing its agricultural subsidies, Legras said.
   He said that senior officials, after three days of
GATT-sponsored negotiations, had set ``clear and precise''
objectives for the remainder of the running round of world trade
talks under GATT.
   Denis said a committee will meet in six months to assess
compliance with the farm accord. However, violators face no
penalties.
   The issue of food security, which preoccupied Japan, Indonesia,
the Nordic countries and Switzerland, was resolved by requiring
negotiators to address the problem in the next 20 months, Denis
said.
   Officials said those countries were worried that liberalized
trade arrangements could leave them dependent on food imports.
   In the other main dispute, the Community insisted on the right
to redistribute its payments to farmers even while reducing their
overall level. The United States and other producer countries
charged the European approach ran counter to the goal of
liberalizing trade under the current set of GATT talks, known as
the Uruguay Round.
   GATT spokesman David Woods said progress also was made regarding
trade in textiles and clothing, patents and other intellectual
property rights, and safeguards, or escape clauses for countries
confronted with a sudden surge of imports.
   Those issues, together with the clash over farm policy, held up
other agreements reached at a GATT ministerial meeting in Montreal
last December. The current four-year round of talks is due to end
at the end of 1990.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission today
approved the drastic streamlining of its procedure for the
licensing of nuclear power plants that the commission's chairman
said could halve the current time needed to build a plant.
   However, Chairman Lando Zech said he knew of no company
interested in building a new nuclear plant. No one has ordered a
plant since 1978 and the oldest active order was placed in 1974.
   The new process provides for advance approval of possible sites
and standard plant designs and combines most of the current
construction and operating licenses into a single license, to be
issued only after all safety issues have been resolved in
pre-construction proceedings.
   Currently, many issues, such as evacuation planning, are left
until the operating license, usually not considered until the plant
is complete.
   Recent plants have taken an average of 13 years to complete.
Some of that delay has resulted from suspension of construction at
some plants for financial reasons.
   After a unanimous vote by the commission to approve the new
licensing procedure, Zech told reporters, ``We should be able to
build a plant in six years or less in this country.''
   The commission has long wanted a more streamlined licensing
procedure but has been unable to persuade Congress to enact one.
Without new legislation the commission must still hold two
hearings, one on whether to grant the combined construction and
operating license and the second on whether all the license
conditions have been met.
   Zech said he believed the new regulations had narrowed the range
of issues to be considered at the second hearing so much that
legislation would not be necessary.
   Many analysts have pointed to the proliferation of reactor
designs as an impediment to management, training, maintenance and
construction. The nation's 110 licensed plants and 11 under
construction encompass more than 60 designs.
   Zech said General Electric Corp., Westinghouse Corp., Combustion
Engineering Inc. and the Electric Power Research Institute all have
asked the commission staff to review versions of a current plant
design for possible licensing.

   Hyatt Corp., the hotel chain renowned for stunning
glass atrium lobbies, swank service and pricey rooms, is planning
to try its hand at luxury group-housing for seniors.
   Penny Pritzker, member of the billionaire family that controls
Hyatt, said the Classic Residence subsidiary she heads is part of a
broader trend by big business to get into the fragmented but
potentially lucrative market of residences for retirees.
   Classic Residence ``was a family-generated idea,'' she said. ``I
was very much involved in it, but we do things as a family.''
   Those things include 95 U.S. hotels and 50 abroad, a Chicago law
firm, casinos, farmland and about 60 industrial concerns. The
Pritzkers are also known for dabbling in takeover situations, most
recently the MCorp banks of Texas and Eastern Airlines.
   Hyatt researchers found that the top 10 providers of
group-housing for seniors had less than 10 facilities each, she
said in a telephone interview from Chicago, where the family's
operations are based.
   ``It's been basically a developer-driven business,'' she said,
``and in our view it's a service business and that's something we
know very well.''
   She predicted there eventually will be ``brand consolidation,
and we'll be able to capitalize.''
   ``Our expertise in food and beverage and maid and linen service,
and our general knowledge of consumer services, will give us an
edge in the business.''
   Hyatt is developing Classic Residences in Dallas, Teaneck, N.J.,
and Reno, Nev., scheduled to open within weeks of each other this
summer. Others are under construction in Riverdale, N.Y., and Chevy
Chase, Md.
   ``Our hope is to do four or five projects a year,'' said Ms.
Pritzker.
   The Dallas version includes an atrium, a trademark of Hyatt
hotels, but that is just coincidence since the building was
purchased by the company from another developer who originally
intended it to be a condominium, said Gary Anderson, the director
of the 147-room project.
   It won't be cheap to live in one of the Hyatt homes _ rents in
the Dallas Classic Residence range from $1,800 to $2,600 per month.
But Anderson said the cost is comparable to expenses for
maintaining a house, buying groceries and paying for transportation.
   There'll be maids, linen service, 24-hour security, planned
activities, a library, 25 meals a month and a concierge to handle
requests.
   ``Hyatt got into the business because we think ... our ability
to provide quality service, as well as our brand recognition, is
something that is familiar to seniors,'' Ms. Pritzker said.
   Potential residents are ``individuals who have generally set
aside some money for retirement,'' Anderson said. ``We're looking
for the retired school teacher, the guy who retired from GM ...
fairly everyday people.''
   The idea is that seniors who have recently sold a house will
have a large amount of cash that they can add to pensions and
Social Security to afford the rent easily.
   ``The only concern we have ... is the real estate market,''
Anderson said. Houses in Dallas frequently sit unsold for months at
a time, a consequence of the state's depressed economy.
   ``It's just a fact of doing business in Texas right now,''
Anderson said.
   He predicted Hyatt's Classic Residences will appeal to folks who
have sufficient resources to rent out their homes and live at
luxury facilities.
   Included in the rent is long-term care insurance which will pay
residents $40 a day toward nursing-home care should they need it
eventually. Anderson said the insurance, combined with what
residents already were paying in rent, should cover nursing homes
charges.
   Hyatt was able to buy the Dallas building, which is within a
block of a nursing home and two blocks of a major Dallas hospital,
for less than it could build a in a similar location, he said.
   Hyatt has reached agreement with the nursing home to provide
assistance to any residents who might need it. In other planned
locations, a section of the residence will be set aside for people
who need ``assisted living.''
   The Teaneck project already is 25 percent to 30 percent leased,
and ``we're very pleased with that,'' Ms. Pritzker said.

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca last year
received nearly $3.7 million in cash, benefits and stock, far below
the $17.9 million he received the year before, the company said
Friday.
   In proxy statements being mailed to shareholders, Chrysler said
the 64-year-old Iacocca received about $1.47 million in salary and
incentive payments, $2.2 million in stocks or exercised stock
options and $12,000 in company contributions to a savings plan.
   The previous year, Iacocca received $13.5 million in stock
options and $1.49 million in salary, benefits and incentive
compensation. The rest came in stock and cash bonuses and a stock
grant.
   The United Auto Workers union, which called Iacocca's 1987
payment ``an incredible ripoff,'' did not immediately comment on
the 1988 figures.
   Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, Iacocca's likely
successor, received $1.2 million in salary, benefits and stocks;
Chrysler Motors Corp. Chairman Bennett Bidwell received $1.2
million; Chrysler Motors President Robert Lutz received $979,256,
and Executive Vice President for Finance Robert Miller received
$902,453.
   In addition, the top five officers also received stock options,
with various redemption values, to buy shares at $25.88 each.
Iacocca received options on 120,000 shares; Greenwald, 75,000;
Bidwell and Lutz, 60,000 each; and Miller, 45,000.
   Chrysler common stock was trading at about $24.13 a share at
midday Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Chrysler was the first of the Big Three automakers to release
its proxy statement. Ford Motor Co.'s is expected to be released
next week and General Motors Corp.'s the following week.

<HEAD>NJ Casino Commission Rejects Atlantis License Renewal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM KRATTENMAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Casino Control Commission voted
unanimously Friday to reject Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel
application for license renewal, the first such denial in New
Jersey's decade-old casino industry.
   Commission Chairman Walter Read said the financially troubled
casino failed to demonstrate the financial resources, business
ability or integrity to merit an extension of its current license.
The Atlantis license expires next Friday.
   ``The conclusion is inescapable,'' Read said. ``The ESA
(Elsinore's Shore Associates) has not demonstrated these. If we
were to grant relicensure, these standards would be rendered
meaningless.''
   Elsinore Shore Associates is Atlantis' parent company.
   The commission now has to decide what to do next with the
Atlantis _ close it down or appoint a conservator.
   Elsinore lawyer Harry Levin had asked the commissioners Thursday
to grant the license with the understanding the company could meet
standards long enough to find a buyer. The casino says any chance
of fetching a fair price would be spoiled by a closing or
appointment of a conservator.
   Levin cited the owners' ``obligations'' to stockholders,
employees and creditors _ who are owed an estimated $2 million in
overdue payments.
   ``It occurs to all of us that the one certain way to make
certain all of these entities are made whole and all constituents
are served is to allow us to dispose of this property in a normal,
orderly fashion,'' Levin said.
   Elsinore president Jeanne Hood testified earlier in the week
that several prospective buyers have surfaced and that a sale
likely can be completed in coming months.
   But state lawyer David Arrajj told commissioners Thursday that
state gaming regulators have already given the Atlantis more than
enough leeway in allowing the company to stay in business while it
worked through bankruptcy reorganization over the last three years.
   He said Elsinore merely has posted more big losses and fallen
deeper into debt. He also cited the casino's admission in testimony
that it failed on occasion to maintain the state-required minimum
reserve, aimed at ensuring payoff on a gambler's big winnings.
   ``This is not the mark of an applicant possessed with sufficient
ability to justify licensure,'' Arrajj said.
   He said allowing the Atlantis to stay open on shaky financial
ground would heighten the risk of organized crime and other dangers
the state Casino Control Act was designed to prevent.
   Levin took offense and said the Atlantis owners and management
have always demonstrated exemplary conduct regardless of their
financial struggle.
   ``Anytime you have a business that goes out of business _
anytime a book gets burned _ it's bad for everybody,'' Levin told
reporters after Thursday's hearing.
   In movement on its other front, Elsinore argued before the
bankruptcy court Wednesday that ``chaos'' would reign if the gaming
hall lost its license.
   Closing arguments came less than 24 hours after the Atlantis
owners went before federal court to seek protection from state
action to close down the casino or appoint a conservator.
   The judge denied the owners' bid for immediate protection but
did not rule out action after the commission made its decision.

   Share prices closed lower Friday on the London
Stock Exchange, but some bargain-hunting lifted prices above the
day's lows.
   Shares opened sharply lower with the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index dropping nearly 25 points in the first few
minutes of trading.
   The 100-share index closed 6.8 points, or 0.3 percent, lower at
2,045.7, near the day's high of 2,045.9 which came shortly before
the close.
   Volume was 475.7 million shares, down from 758.3 million shares
Thursday.
   Some bearish British economic forecasts by two major British
brokerage firms helped depress the market for most of Friday's
trading session.
   But those lower prices encouraged some selective buying by the
major British institutions, lifting stocks off their session lows.
Some dealers said the institutions were merely waiting for the
market to reach these lower levels before they returned to purchase
stock on a large scale.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 1.2 points lower at
1,683.0. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 5.58 points to
close at 1,162.26.

   Most futures prices for soybeans and grains were
lower at the close Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analyst Barney Janecki of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said most of
the pressure was in the wheat pit where traders were concerned
about a reduction in the U.S. export bonus offers to the Soviet
Union as the result of the pact reached by 100 nations meeting at
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva.
   The accord calls for an overall cap on farm supports and import
barriers through 1990, officials reported.
   Wheat prices slipped as much as 6{ cents for the May contract.
   Profit-taking was reported in new crop soybeans after they had
gained some ground in recent days, said Janecki.
   He said weather in the U.S. Midwest and South America was not a
significant factor on the market.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 6{ cents lower, with the

<HEAD>Milken, Brother Plead Innocent To Racketeering, Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, former head of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.'s high-yield junk bond department, pleaded innocent
Friday to a wide-ranging federal indictment that charged him with
turning the investment banking house into a racketeering enterprise.
   Milken, dressed in a navy blue, pinstriped suit entered his plea
in a courtroom packed with more than 200 reporters, lawyers and the
curious.
   Also entering innocent pleas before U.S. District Judge Kimba
Wood at federal court in Manhattan was Milken's brother, Lowell,
40. A third defendant, former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg was
absent due to a skiing accident and will be arraigned at a later
date.
   All three were named in a 98-count federal securities fraud and
racketeering indictment handed up by a grand jury March 29.
   Michael Milken entered the courtroom smiling and when Ms. Wood
asked him how he felt, replied: ``O.K., your honor,'' prompting
laughter from the standing-room-only crowd.
   Both Milkens were released without having to post bail after
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said prosecutors and defense
lawyers had ``made substantial progress'' during talks to reach an
acceptable bond for the defendants and their assets.
   The charges seek $1.8 billion in forfeitures from each of the
three defendants, or their total combined earnings from 1984 to
1987. The government reportedly had asked the three defendants each
to post a $1 billion bond to avoid pretrial restraints on their
assets.
   Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
act, assets found to be the result of racketeering activities are
subject to forfeiture and prosecutors could ask the judge to freeze
the Milkens' assets to guarantee their availability in the event of
conviction.
   If convicted, each of the three also face maximum fines of $3.7
billion if convicted on either or both of the racketeering counts.
   Those fines represent the highest possible amounts under federal
racketeering law _ that is, double the gains made from the
allegedly illegal enterprise _ that a judge may impose.
   Ms. Wood scheduled another court session for Tuesday morning, at
Carroll's request, to finalize bond arrangements. The judge also
scheduled Newberg's arraignment for April 25.
   Milken, 42, following his indictment took a leave of absence
from his job as head of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based
high-yield junk bond division, where he reportedly made more than
$1 billion between 1983 and 1987.
   Milken widely is considered a pioneer in making the low-grade
securities a key source of financing for a wide range of corporate
deals.
   The racketeering indictment followed a more than two-year
investigation of Wall Street's fifth-largest investment firm was
triggered by information supplied by convicted stock speculator
Ivan Boesky.

<HEAD>Washington Apple Shipments Report First Weekly Increase In Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WENATCHEE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shipments of Washington state apples
increased slightly last week after losing ground for a month, an
indication consumers may be overcoming fears of a chemical scare
that began in February, an industry official said Friday.
   Total out-of-state shipments last week were 1.196 million
42-pound boxes, compared with 1.191 million the previous week, said
Bill Dewitt, manager of the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association,
which tracks sales of Washington apples, the largest apple crop in
the nation.
   Washington state shipments represent the first increase in a
month, but the numbers are still below the annual average, Dewitt
said. For the same week last year, more than 1.4 million boxes were
shipped.
   Figures from other big apple-growing states _ New York, Michigan
and Virginia _ were not available Friday, but Dewitt said other
states appear to reflect Washington's upturn.
   ``I do know what they've been doing over the last three weeks is
comparable and I would hope they are leveling out, too,'' he said.
   Included in the Washington state figures is a 10,000-box
increase in the Red Delicious variety, a sign that consumers are
overcoming fears of potential health risks posed by the
growth-regulating chemical Alar, Dewitt said.
   Alar is used primarily on red varieties of apples to enhance
color and keep them on the tree longer, although industry officials
contend the chemical is used on only 5 percent of the crop.
   ``The good news is we had considerably more Red Delicious
shipped last week,'' Dewitt said. ``The shipments have been going
down, especially on Red Delicious, for the past four weeks or so.
This is the first turnaround we've had. We hope it's a sign of
things to come.''
   The national Alar scare has prompted apple growers to consider a
variety of tactics to ease the drop in sales, including destroying
all Alar-treated apples now in storage.
   However, Dewitt attributed the turnaround to an aggressive
marketing campaign by apple marketers and statements by health
officials that the amounts of Alar in the fruit pose no known
health problems.
   ``We think we're beginning to see some results from the good
advertising by retailers,'' he said. ``We're beginning to see the
results of statements by the USDA (Department of Agriculture), the
surgeon general, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and the
FDA (Food and Drug Administration) that there is no problem with
the amount of Alar in some of the apples now.''
   Apple shipments reached record-high levels in the two weeks
following a report in late February by the Natural Resources
Defense Council, which contended Alar was a cancer-causing agent.
Since then, shipments have fallen steadily, reflecting orders made
since the report's release.
   ``We should be doing more. April normally is a good month for
us,'' Dewitt said. ``We need to be up in at least the 1.5-million
box range for the next few weeks to really be able to get our
apples sold.''
   Taiwan, which canceled several orders immediately after the Alar
report, has begun accepting shipments of about 30,000 boxes a week,
which is ``good'' for this time of year, Dewitt said.
   While shipments of the Red Delicious variety fell, shipments of
the state's two other major varieties, non-red Golden Delicious and
Granny Smith, have been extremely good, he said.

   The stock market showed a moderate gain today
following what analysts described as an ambiguous report on
employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.08 to 2,302.05
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 837 up, 548 down and
519 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the unemployment
rate declined to 5.0 percent, a new 15-year low, in March, from 5.1
percent the month before. That surprised analysts, who had been
looking for a small increase.
   By contrast, the data also showed a smaller-than-expected gain
of 180,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, providing some support
for the view that the economy has been slowing since early this
year.
   Brokers said the overall result was something of a letdown,
since many investors had been hoping for a more clear-cut signal
that pressures were abating on inflation and interest rates.
   But traders also apparently interpreted the data as positive for
technology stocks, which have been depressed lately by earnings
worries and concern about a possible business slump.
   The group also got a boost from Businessland Inc., which said it
expected to post record profits for the fiscal quarter ended March
31, citing increased sales of International Business Machines and
Apple Computer products.
   IBM shares rose 1| to 109| and Apple, traded in the
over-the-counter market, climbed 1[ to 37[. Businessland, up 1] at
12], ranked among the day's best percentage gainers.
   Elsewhere among technology issues, Digital Equipment rose 1{ to
97{; Honeywell 2| to 73{, and Hewlett-Packard 1| to 53].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.82 to 166.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .18 at 330.26.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 132.89 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>World Bank to Lend Up to $2 Billion, Official Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Voljc is cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank likely will lend Mexico
between $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year, that institution's
Mexico representative said Friday.
   Marco Voljc told reporters the funds will be used to develop
infrastructure and not to bolster Mexico's balance of payments and
foreign reserves. Similar credits could be extended on an annual
basis, he said.
   The credit will help President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's
government press forward with its efforts to cut net outflow of
capital needed to revitalize Mexico's stagnant economy.
   Salinas has sought to reduce foreign debt servicing, which will
cost about $16 billion this year, and to obtain $7 billion through
lower payments and new loans each year for the next six years.
   Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe visited Washington and New York
this week to press for an accord with creditor governments and
banks that would slice Mexico's debt servicing from 6 percent to 2
percent of its gross national product this year.
   Voljc said the World Bank credit would apply to development
projects involving roads and agroindustries, among other projects.
   In a related development, the World Bank will extend a $250
million credit to Mexico for the purchase of industrial equipment,
the government newspaper El Nacional reported Friday.
   Voljc noted that the goverment still must sign a letter of
intent with the International Monetary Fund that pledges additional
economic reforms before Mexico's $107 billion foreign debt can be
restructured.
   Mexico has enacted drastic reforms designed to end decades of
protectionism and force domestic industries to become competitive
internationally. The government dismantled thousands of import
barriers after it joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
in 1986.
   Painful austerity highlighted by liquidations of state-owned
industries and federal spending cuts has cost thousands of workers
their jobs. Workers have lost more than half their buying power
since the onset of the foreign debt crisis in 1982.
   Mexico's reserves, which stood at a record high of $16 billion
in April 1988, have plummeted to $7 billion, according to the
Center for Private Sector Economic Studies. Debt servicing and the
need to finance capital and consumer goods imports under the trade
reforms contributed to the drain.

Friday.
   Of 909 companies surveyed by the Conference Board, 42 percent
increased pay for outside directors last year while only 2 percent
cut back on compensation. The remainder held roughly at 1987 levels.
   According to the survey, the median annual compensation to
directors in the financial services industry jumped 16 percent to
$19,800. The increase followed a year in which virtually no gains
were seen.
   However, it appeared more lucrative to sit on the board of a
manufacturing concern, where the median compensation in cash and
stock grants amounted to $24,000, up 9 percent.
   Manufacturing companies whose annual sales top $5 billion paid
their directors a median $40,000.
   The Conference Board said the median compensation for directors
of service companies like department stores and hotels held at the
1987 median level of $17,600.
   Jeremy Bacon, the board's specialist in directorship practices,
said the increases for manufacturing and financial service concerns
``are large enough to suggest that there is competitive pressure
pushing director compensation higher.''
   He noted that increases are deserved. ``Directors are putting in
longer hours than ever before and making tough calls. There is a
price for that kind of service and commitment.''
   Bacon noted that retirement plans and stock options continue to
gain in popularity as forms of compensation. Last year 28 percent
of the companies polled provided a retirement plan for outside
directors, up from 21 percent in 1987, while 14 percent had stock
options provisions, up from 9 percent in the previous year.

   The president and chief executive officer of the
Commodity Exchange of New York, Alan J. Brody, announced Friday
that he plans to resign effective June 30.
   Brody, 36, said he plans to pursue other business opportunities.
   Brody has served as Comex president and CEO since 1981 and as
chairman from 1987 to 1988, guiding the exchange through the silver
crisis of the early 1980s and complex internal structural changes
and fiscal issues.
   He also was the youngest person ever to be appointed to the
presidency of a U.S. futures exchange.
   ``He has seen us through some some turbulent periods, record
volume years and a major overhaul of our trade processing,'' Comex
Chairman John H. Hanemann said in a statement. ``... It will be
very difficult to replace him.''
   A search committee has been appointed to seek a replacement,
officials said.
   The Comex is the world's most active metals futures market.

   The stock market posted a moderate gain today
following what analysts described as an ambiguous report on
employment.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the unemployment
rate declined to 5.0 percent, a new 15-year low, in March, from 5.1
percent the month before. That surprised analysts, who had been
looking for a small increase.
   By contrast, the data also showed a smaller-than-expected gain
of 180,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, providing some support
for the view that the economy has been slowing since early this
year.
   Brokers said the overall result was something of a letdown,
since many investors had been hoping for a more clear-cut signal
that pressures were abating on inflation and interest rates.
   But traders also apparently interpreted the data as positive for
technology stocks, which have been depressed lately by earnings
worries and concern about a possible business slump.

<HEAD>Government Computer Chiefs Leaving For Private Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failure of Congress to raise federal
salaries is accelerating a brain drain of computer experts from the
government, according to a report in the forthcoming issue of
Information Week magazine.
   Fourteen computer chiefs have left federal service in the last
three years, most of them for sales and marketing jobs with
companies that do business with federal agencies, the magazine says
in its April 10 issue.
   ``Now that we didn't get pay raises, lots will be looking. I
am,'' Reed Phillips, director of information resources management
at the Commerce Department, told the magazine.
   Pay for computer chiefs is sometimes as little as a third what
people could earn in private business, the magazine said. The pay
raise, which was snagged by controversy over a raise for Congress,
would have lifted the ceiling on senior executive pay to $125,000
from $80,000.
   Vacancies have caused ``serious trouble'' at the Internal
Revenue Service and NASA, according to Patricia Ingraham, a task
force member of Paul Volcker's privately funded National Commission
on the Public Service quoted by the magazine.
   Other departments having trouble with vacancies are the
Department of Health and Human Services and the top-secret National
Security Agency, the magazine said.
   At NASA, spokeswoman Terri Sindelar said Friday the low pay
ceiling and other factors that caused professionals to leave were
hurting the entire agency, not just computer operations. ``This is
undercutting the space program by causing a brain drain,'' she said.

<HEAD>Pump Prices Up Sharply This Month Due to Spill, Other Factors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices nationwide are on average sharply higher
following last month's Alaskan oil spill, partly because of factors
that already were inflating prices when the disaster occurred.
   An American Automobile Association survey released Friday
indicated retail prices for self-serve unleaded gasoline as of
Wednesday were up an average of 12 cents a gallon to $1.115 since
Easter weekend, March 24-26.
   The survey showed most of the increase occurred after the March
24 spill, which resulted in the temporary closing of the oil port
of Valdez. In California, unleaded gasoline has risen 11 cents, in
Iowa and Kentucky, 15 cents and in Texas, more than 10 cents since
then.
   The rise in retail prices closely followed a jump in wholesale
prices _ even though there generally is a lag _ as service station
companies scrambled to keep up with their own costs of supply and
ensure that they had enough gas to meet demand.
   ``People were afraid that the crude supply would cause a
shortage of gasoline going into the summer driving season,'' said
Ken Miller, analyst with the petroleum consulting firm of Purvin &amp;
Gertz Inc. in Houston.
   ``There was a fairly rapid pass-through because of the
presumption of a fundamental shortage or a perceived fundamental
shortage, as a result of lost crude supplies,'' Miller said.
   Gasoline prices were headed up even before the disaster,
particularly on the West Coast where inventories were low due to
refinery slowdowns caused by mechanical problems and annual
maintenance.
   In the two weeks before the spill, unleaded wholesale prices in
Los Angeles had risen by more than 10 cents a gallon to an average
of 72 cents, according to data compiled by the newsletter Platt's
Oilgram Price Report.
   After the March 24 spill, Western wholesale prices surged more
than 28 cents due to a combination of factors, including the
temporary shutdown of oil shipments through Valdez from the Prudhoe
Bay fields, which supply 60 percent of West Coast refiners.
   The perception that the spill-related supply squeeze would
produce shortages at the onset of the driving season also helped
boost prices as wholesalers began stockpiling and West Coast
motorists rushed to fill their gas tanks, observers said.
   Nationwide, wholesale prices also rose _ pushing pump prices
higher _ as expectations spread that a supply squeeze in the West
could create higher demand for crude from the Gulf of Mexico and
foreign producers, which account for the bulk of the nation's oil.
   Alaska supplies 25 percent of U.S. oil consumption. Just over
half of that amount goes to West Coast refineries, although states
like Texas and areas of the Midwest and East Coast also depend on
Alaska crude.
   But price increases were more dramatic on the West Coast because
of additional refinery problems, observers said.
   Gary King, supply manager for Benito Tank Lines, a large West
Coast gasoline wholesaler, said some West Coast refineries were
shut down for repair, while others were operating with low
inventories and had to scramble for supply when the prospect of an
Alaskan crude squeeze developed.
   Annual refinery tune-ups had further reduced capacity and
available capacity was tightened somewhat as refiners prepared
their facilities to meet federal regulations requiring higher
octane levels.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said West Coast refinery capacity was down to 73 percent in
March from 84 percent in early January.
   Val Ferrin, western supply manager for oil refiner-distributor
Flying J Inc. of Brigham City, Utah, said one refiner raised prices
by 10 cents a gallon in 24 hours.
   ``At some point in time that has to transfer to retail,'' Ferrin
said.
   Further price pressure has come from the 60 percent rise in
crude prices over the last six months as worldwide production fell.
   But some observers predicted gas prices could decline once oil
operations in Alaska stabilize and as western states look to other
suppliers for their needs.
   ``It's a short-term situation. It won't last longer than the
next couple of weeks,'' said King.
   Prices also might ease as perceptions of a shortage diminish.
The U.S. Department of Energy concluded this week that the dramatic
rise in West Coast prices was caused by ``market psychology'' and
did not warrant emergency use of the nation's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve.
   ``We expect prices to go back down soon,'' said Claudia Barker,
spokeswoman for the California Energy Commission. ``We have
additional crude oil supplies coming in and product supplies that
we normally wouldn't have.''
   California wholesalers bought 2 million barrels of gasoline from
Ecuador, China and Kuwait, although the state normally doesn't
import refined crude, Barker said.
   Chevron U.S.A., the West Coast's largest refiner, purchased 1
million gallons of foreign gasoline on the spot market to alleviate
possible shortfalls, said Mike Libbey, Chevron spokesman in San
Franciso.
   Since the spill, Chevron has raised its wholesale price for
unleaded gasoline by 7 cents to 77 cents a gallon, Libbey said.

   The dollar gained against most major currencies
Friday amid buying inspired by signs of continuing economic
strength in a government employment report and market rumors.
   Gold prices posted modest declines. Republic National Bank of
New York quoted a bid of $383.25 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4
p.m. EDT, 35 cents lower than Thursday's late bid.
   Walter Simon, an assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer &amp;
Co., said dealers bid up the dollar after judging that, on balance,
the Labor Department figures indicated economic growth persists at
more than just a mediocre pace.
   The ambiguous report, which was open to numerous
interpretations, said the civilian unemployment rate fell to a new
15-year low of 5.0 percent last month from 5.1 percent in February.
   The decline, however, was accompanied by a slowdown in job
creation as nonfarm payrolls expanded by 180,000, down from
February's 280,000.
   Additional details in the report were similarly mixed; some
supported the notion that economic activity has moderated while
others hinted at a buildup in inflationary pressures.
   The dollar also moved ahead on buying sparked by two unconfirmed
reports, one involving the possibility of a $30 billion tax cut in
the United States.
   Rumors of the imminent resignation of a high-ranking Japanese
government official _ said by some accounts to be Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita _ caused dealers to lighten their yen holdings in
favor of the U.S. currency.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo where it fell 0.07 yen
to close at 132.08 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 132.42
yen and in New York it finished at 132.725 yen, up from 132.275 on
Thursday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound, which
fell to $1.6975 from $1.7035 late Thursday. Sterling fetched
$1.6945 late in New York, compared to $1.7005 Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates, included: 1.8765 West German marks, up from 1.8730;
1.6499 Swiss francs, up from 1.6445; 6.336 French francs, up from
6.3250; 1,376.00 Italian lire, up from 1,373.50; and, 1.19305
Canadian dollars, down from 1.19325.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.8745 West German marks, up from 1.8700;
1.6500 Swiss francs, up from 1.6415; 6.3340 French francs, up from
6.3125; 2.1110 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1090; 1,373.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,371.75; and 1.1928 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1935.
   In New York, a troy ounce of gold for current delivery closed at
$383.40 on the Commodity Exchange, down from Thursday's settlement
of $384.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $381.75 a troy ounce,
compared with $384.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to close
at $382.00 an ounce compared with $384.35 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 59 cents to close at $386.15 an
ounce.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid of $5.76 a troy ounce, compared with
Thursday's $5.82.
   Silver for current delivery also declined in New York, falling
to $5.769 an ounce on the Comex from $5.800 on Thursday.

   The Big Three automakers are beginning to set up
the order of succession as the automotive industry heads into the
1990s, and the pictures are clearing up a little.
   But there's still one question: Who is the odds-on favorite to
follow Roger Smith at General Motors Corp.?
   There were reports through the week that Allan Gilmour, now
executive vice president at Ford Motor Co., is on track to be
Chairman Donald Petersen's successor in the fall of 1991, when
Petersen reaches Ford's mandatory retirement age of 65.
   The reports said an announcement could come as early as Monday
of Gilmour becoming a vice chairman. Ford officials decline to
comment.
   Over at Chrysler Corp., Chairman Lee Iacocca's contract runs out
in December 1991, and there's speculation that he would not seek
another. He would be 67 years old then.
   In November, Chrysler shuffled its upper-level management,
leaving Gerald Greenwald as vice chairman and likely successor to
Iacocca.
   So far, no one has emerged as the favorite follower to Smith,
who turns 65 in July of next year, and stands to be the first of
the current chairmen to move aside.
   ``There's no question at GM there's a number of people in the
running,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. ``It's
just a question of exactly who.''
   Merlis said automotive chief executive officers of the 1990s
will have to have some specific skills.
   ``It's going to be much more international than ever before,''
he said of the industry. ``Managing joint ventures is going to be
important. Running Europe is going to be important.''
   Greenwald and Gilmour each have work in international automotive
operations on their resumes. Gilmour currently is Ford's executive
vice president for international operations.
   Before moving to Chrysler in April 1979, Greenwald served as
president or a director of Ford businesses in France and Venezuela
and at the company's European headquarters.
   ``Certainly the opportunities for the (Ford and GM) CEOs of the
'90s is cross-fertilization between the United States and Europe,''
Merlis said.
   Merlis added that for Chrysler, which doesn't have the same
presence in Europe as do its two larger cousins, ``it is how to
take its beachhead in Europe and turn it into more meaningful
penetration.''
   Along with international operations, Merlis said new CEOs will
have problems in the United States which will require some
experience in the financial end of the car-making business.
   From September 1979 through July of 1983 Greenwald was
Chrysler's executive vice president for finance. Gilmour joined
Ford in 1960 as part of the financial staff and rose to executive
vice president for finance in 1968, a post he held until 1972.
   ``The real challenge will be fixing the (manufacturing)
overcapacity problem,'' Merlis said. ``It's not a problem that will
last long. Clearly plants will have to close and that's a challenge
the CEOs will have to face.''

   Oil futures prices rose in light trading Friday
in what analysts called a technical recovery from a decline in the
previous session.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 22
cents to close at $20.02 a barrel. Other contract months also
gained.
   Refined products traded on the exchange also rose. Unleaded
gasoline for May delivery closed .40 cent higher at 64.95 cents a
gallon and May heating oil settled up .38 cent at 51.60 cents.
Other contract months mostly were higher.
   Energy brokers attributed Friday's gains mostly to technical
factors, but said the market got a lift from news that Exxon Corp.
and British Petroleum Inc. would not curtail crude shipments to the
West Coast because of the oil spill off the Alaskan coast.
   In addition, British Petroleum announced the shutdown of an oil
platform in the North Sea for repairs.
   ``That takes production out of the market and impacts prices,''
said Richard Kane, energy broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Crude prices also continue to gain strength from investor
confidence that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
is serious about reducing production.
   The International Energy Agency in its monthly oil market report
on Friday estimated OPEC production for March at 19.6 million
barrels a day, 200,000 barrels less than in February. The cartel
has cut its production by about 3 million barrels since last
December in an effort to strengthen world oil prices.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Prices Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain futures prices tumbled Friday on the Chicago Board of
Trade as a new trading agreement in Switzerland sent shockwaves
across the Atlantic.
   On other futures markets, livestock and meat prices were mostly
lower; precious metals slipped; copper soared and energy prices
advanced.
   Wheat prices slipped as much as 9 cents for the May contract.
   Barney Janecki, a Chicago analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said traders were concerned about a reduction in the U.S.
export bonus offers to the Soviet Union as the result of the pact
reached Friday by 100 nations meeting at the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva.
   The GATT accord calls for an overall cap on farm supports and
import barriers through 1990, officials reported.
   Profit-taking was reported in new crop soybeans after they had
gained some ground in recent days, said Janecki.
   He said weather in the U.S. Midwest and South America was not a
significant factor on the market.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 9 cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.91{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cent lower to {
cent higher, with May at $2.66 a bushel; oats were 1\ cent lower to
\ cent higher, with May at $1.85{; and soybeans were 2\ cent to 6
cents lower, with May at $7.11} a bushel.
   Most livestock and meat prices were lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research of Arlington Heights,
Ill., said the pork complex was depressed by the current large hog
slaughter.
   The cattle market sold off early due, which Morgan attributed to
a seasonally low demand period at this time, but prices for live
cattle recovered late in the session.
   Cattle settled .30 cent higher to .30 cent lower, with the
contract for delivery in April at 77.85 cents a pound, feeder
cattle were .20 cent to 1.05 cent lower, with April at 77.62 cents
pound; live hogs were .15 cent higher to .42 cent lower, with April
at 39.55 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to
.90 cent lower, with April at 34.32 cents a pound.
   Copper prices soared and precious metals fell on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   Analyst Tony Ellis of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. said
there was talk of tighter supplies among copper traders, but he
credited the day's rally in copper futures mostly to technical
reasons.
   Gold, which ususally moves in the opposite direction of the U.S.
dollar, was depressed by a firmer dollar, analysts said.
   Gold settled 60 cents to 70 cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in April at $383.40 a troy ounce; silver was 3.1 cents to
3.7 cents lower, with April at $5.77 a troy ounce; and copper was
1.9 cents to 3.15 cents higher, with April at $1.34 a pound.
   Most energy prices were higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Crude oil settled 22 cents to 49 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in May at $20.02 a barrel; heating oil was .31 cent
lower to .38 cent higher, with May at 51.60 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to 1.15 cents higher, with May at
64.95 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Companies Look For Ways To Keep Older Workers, Attract Retirees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET McCONNAUGHEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies ranging from fast-food giant
McDonald's Corp. to aircraft maker Grumman Corp. agree they need to
attract older workers to stave off an impending labor shortage as
baby boomers age.
   ``There is really no choice,'' Daniel E. Knowles, vice president
for human resources and planning at Grumman, told a National
Council on the Aging seminar in New Orleans recently. ``If we're
going to increase productivity and meet the needs of an aging
workforce, we're going to have to totally change the concept of
retirement.''
   Statisticians say the average age is rising in this country.
People in the baby boom generation have had fewer children than
their parents and have waited longer to have children, while
medical advances have kept their parents alive longer.
   Meanwhile, the number of people available to take jobs has
tightened, said Philip Rones of the Bureau of Labor Standards.
   ``We have 3 million fewer younger workers than we did 10 years
ago,'' said Rones. ``We're in the middle of the nation's longest
peacetime expansion. Unemployment is at a 15-year low.''
   The dearth of teen-agers coupled with a tight labor market has
prompted McDonald's to look for older people to work as everything
from burger-flipper to managers for its fast-food restaurants.
   ``We recruit from our customers,'' said Stanley Stein, a senior
vice president at McDonald's Corp. in Oak Brook, Ill. ``We use tray
liners, counter cards, brochures.''
   McDonald's emphasizes that older workers can set their own hours
and won't work enough hours to lose Social Security benefits, said
Stein.
   Participants in the conference agreed that the possible loss of
Social Security or pension benefits is one of the biggest obstacles
to keeping older workers.
   When Travelers Insurance Co. set up a job bank for its own
retired workers, it also had to change restrictions that kept
workers from collecting their pensions if they continued to work.
   Harold Johnson, former personnel director for Travelers and now
senior vice president of a company that trains executives, said
retirees can work 1,000 hours a year _ the equivalent of six months
_ without affecting their pension.
   Travelers calls them when it needs a temporary worker, and at
least half of the 1,000 or so temporaries called in each day are
retired from the company, said Johnson.
   He said Travelers also eliminated its mandatory retirement age
and set up a plan for workers who wanted to continue working
part-time rather than full-time after the age of 65.
   Not every company _ or even a majority _ is worried about a
labor shortage or looking toward older people as its solution, said
participants at the conference.
   ``For every company that does, dozens and dozens aren't,'' said
Johnson. ``Downsizing is a fact of life in American industry and
older employees are the most affected. And dozens of dozens of
companies are still laboring under the myths that we have blown
away.''
   The myths include beliefs that a worker's ability deteriorates
with age and that older workers will cost a company more in sick
leave and medical benefits than their work is worth, said
conference participants.
   Laura Myers McCoy, a spokeswoman for Days Inns of America Inc.,
said her company's elderly workers not only have a better
attendance rate than their younger counterparts but stay longer.
She said the corporate headquarters in Atlanta loses an average of
40 percent of its reservation agents every year.
   ``The turnover rate among the older workers at our corporate
office is less than 1 percent,'' she said.
   Knowles said Grumman's highly trained workforce has always
tended to be older than average _ something which itself refutes
the belief that a younger worker is a better worker.
   ``When we put a man on the moon 20 years ago, we made the lunar
module,'' he said. ``Our past president told me, `It wasn't a bunch
of kids who put a man on the moon. It was a bunch of middle-aged
and older workers.'
   ``That wasn't a put-down of kids. It was just a positive
statement acknowledging the long services of the older guys, and
that all that service and smarts made the place tick.''
   Knowles said the average age at Grumman rose from 37 to 45
between 1970 and 1977, when a decreasing market forced 13,600
layoffs. Rather than age or seniority, he said, the layoffs were
based on each department's ranking of its workers from best to
worst.

<TEXT>
   Young, trim, well-dressed and earnest, dozens of
friends and self-proclaimed fans of Michael Milken came to a
federal courthouse Friday to see the deposed junk bond king
arraigned.
   Other businessmen and colleagues promised to mount a public
campaign against charges that Milken engineered a series of illegal
deals cited by the government in a landmark 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment against he and two others.
   ``It's hard for those who know him to square what the
government's alleging against what we see privately,'' said Ralph
Ingersoll, chairman of Ingersoll Publications Co. and a friend of
Milken's.
   Milken, 42, is credited with helping reshape corporate America
in the 1980s from his Beverly Hills, Calif., office of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. through the sale of high-yield junk bonds that
allowed small- and medium-sized companies to expand rapidly _ and
gave corporate raiders a ready source of financing.
   He has been a target of government prosecutors for more than two
years and is charged with defrauding clients, investors and the
public by violating securities laws. Supporters and defense lawyers
claim he has been unfairly persecuted.
   More than 200 reporters, courtroom artists, lawyers and Milken
friends packed the courtroom to hear Milken and his brother Lowell
plead not guilty to all charges. Another 50 people were kept
outside for lack of space.
   After the arraignment, dozens of supporters cheered and shouted
``Good luck, Michael,'' as he descended the courthouse steps, shook
some hands and was whisked away in a limousine.
   Supporters also rallied for Milken at the Beverly Hilton Hotel,
site of Drexel's annual junk bond conference in Beverly Hills.
   A handful of fans at the Manhattan courthouse wore white
baseball caps saying ``Mike Milken, We Believe In You'' _ the same
message that appeared in full-page ads paid for by friends and
business associates in major newspapers last week.
   Supporters questioned by an Associated Press reporter refused to
say whether they worked for Drexel, which has reached a plea deal
with the government to settle securities fraud charges.
   Drexel denied reports that the government told it to bar a
planned rally by Drexel employees at the court in support of Milken.

<HEAD>Iacocca Gets $3.7 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca received
about $3.7 million and future stock options from the nation's
third-largest automaker last year, down from $17.9 million in 1987,
according to the company's proxy statement released Friday.
   The main reason for the big decline was that Iacocca exercised
far fewer stock options in 1988 than he did the previous year.
   In 1987, Iacocca exercised $13.5 million worth of stock options,
while stock options represented about $2.2 million of what Iacocca
received in 1988.
   His salary, benefits and earnings incentives for 1988 were only
1.7 percent less than what he received the previous year.
   The proxy statement is being mailed to shareholders in advance
of Chrysler's annual meeting set for May 18 in San Francisco.
   In a statement Friday, UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice
President Marc Stepp, head of the union's Chrysler Department, said
the executive salaries ``continue to send a message reflecting
misplaced priorities.''
   ``There can be no possible justification for the excessive
salaries, bonuses and receipts from stock transactions reported in
today's proxy statement,'' Bieber and Stepp said in a prepared
statement.
   Last year, Stepp called the payments announced just before the
union and the company sat down at the bargaining table ``an
incredible ripoff.''
   Chrysler is the first of the Big Three automakers to release its
1988 proxy statement. Ford Motor Co. is expected to release its
statement next week, and General Motors Corp.'s is due after that.
   The statement said Iacocca, 64, received about $1.47 million in
salary and 1987 incentive payments, $2.2 million in stocks or stock
options exercised and $12,000 in company contributions to a savings
plan.
   In addition, the statement said Iacocca will become eligible for
several other stock option plans at the end of 1990 and 1991, when
Iacocca's current contract expires. Those options, if exercised,
could bring him $18.1 million at the end of 1990 and another
$630,000 at the end of 1991.
   Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, the likely successor to
Iacocca, received $1.2 million in salary, benefits and stocks;
Chrysler Motors Corp. Chairman Bennett Bidwell received $1.2
million; Chrysler Motors President Robert Lutz received $979,256,
and Executive Vice President for Finance Robert Miller received
$902,453, the proxy statement said.
   In addition, the top five officers also received stock option
rights, with various redemption values depending on the time the
stock is held, to shares valued at $25.88 each. Iacocca received
such options on 120,000 shares; Greenwald, 75,000; Bidwell and
Lutz, 60,000; and Miller, 45,000.
   Chrysler's top 22 officers received $12.9 million in salaries,
bonuses and incentives during 1988, an average of $584,760 each.
   The company earned $1.05 billion in 1988, down from $1.29
billion the year before. By comparison, Ford reported $5.3 billion
in profits last year, and GM said it earned $4.86 billion in 1988.
   The UAW said in its statement that workers and consumers were
losing patience with automobile company executives' high
compensation levels.
   ``Today, with domestic market share continuing to fall in the
face of mounting import an transplant sales,'' the statement said,
``it is simply unconscionable to assume the kind of `business as
usual' posture reflected in the compensation awards disclosed
today.''
   The UAW said Iacocca's salary worked out to a little more than
$416 an hour, 29 times more than that of a typical assembler. Add
on to that stock options and bonuses, the union said, and Iacocca's
salary rises to 119 times that of the assembler.
   The union praised Chrysler's cut-rate financing incentives
designed to increase sales and its trade efforts in Washington.
But, UAW asked, ``Why do they have such an enormous blind spot when
it comes to their own affairs?''

<HEAD>Treasury Bond Prices End Lower On Employment Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished lower Friday, retreating
quickly after an early spurt in a confused reaction to the Labor
Department's employment report, which contained both good and bad
news for traders.
   The good news that caused a brief rally was that the non-farm
payroll rose less than expected in March. The bad news was that the
civilian jobless rate fell to 5 percent, the lowest in more than 15
years.
   Strong economic growth chills the bond market by raising fears
of higher inflation, which erodes fixed-income securities.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, up nearly a point in the
first half-hour after the report's 8:30 a.m. EDT release, ended the
day with a decline of 11-16 point, or $6.88 per $1,000 face amount.
   The bond's yield, which rises when the price falls, climbed to
9.11 percent from 9.01 percent late Thursday.
   Trading was light despite confusion over the figures and the
widespread expectation that they would have a powerful effect on
the market. Some traders said the market had already begun looking
ahead to next week's wholesale price report for guidance.
   ``Life on Wall Street, expecially in fixed-income securities, is
spent waiting for the next number,'' said Anthony Naylor, a senior
vice president at Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
   Besides the drop in the jobless rate, traders were concerned
about a 0.4 percent increase in average hourly earnings, which
indicated inflation continues to rise, said William V. Sullivan,
director of money market research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Prices of short-term governments fell 1-16 point to 9-32 point,
intermediate maturities were off about 5-16 point and long-term
issues fell about 11-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., a
financial data service.
   The movement of a point equals a $10 change in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.32 to 1,121.07.
   In corporate trading, industrials fell. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, slipped
1.19 to 299.09.
   Prices of municipal bonds also fell. The Bond Buyer index was
not available late Friday.
   The pessimism about inflation did not carry over to the Treasury
bill market.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 9.11 percent as the
discount dropped 5 basis points to 8.80 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 9.27 percent as the discount rose 2 basis
points to 8.75 percent. Yields on the one-year bills issued on
Thursday rose to 9.50 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to
8.75 percent from the level at auction.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 9} percent, down from 913-16 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Casino Commission Denies Atlantis License Renewal; Considers Conservator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM KRATTENMAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Casino Control Commission voted
unanimously Friday to reject a bid by Elsinore's Atlantis Casino
Hotel to stay in business despite deep financial trouble, the
first-ever denial of a license renewal in New Jersey's decade-long
casino history.
   Commission Chairman Walter Read said Elsinore Shore Associates _
the casino owners _ failed in their two-week hearing to demonstrate
that they could remain financially viable to merit an extension of
their current license, which expires next Friday.
   Five hours after the 5-0 vote, the commission took another
unprecedented step and appointed a state conservator to run the
Atlantis until it can be sold.
   The move at least temporarily ensured that the casino would stay
open and the 2,100 employees would keep their jobs despite the
license expiration on April 14.
   Read, referring to testimony by Elsinore vice president Bruce
McKee, scolded the company for shoddy operations and dubious
financial projections.
   ``Mr. McKee said that he would prefer not to call the licensee a
`seat of the pants' operation,'' Read said before moving for the
license denial. ``But it is clear from figures regarding cash
position and overdue payables that it is precisely that.''
   The casino, which emerged from bankruptcy reorganization last
September, has posted losses each of the last four years, including
a whopping $75 million in 1988. It also has failed consistently to
meet the financial projections upon which its previous license
renewals were based, Read noted.
   Elsinore president Jeanne Hood said she was ``overwhelmed'' by
the commission action. She collected more than $352,000 in salary
and bonuses last year, and the casino's past due bills approached
$2 million. Ms. Hood said she was ``most anxious'' to keep the
Atlantis open for the sake of the employees.
   Elsinore admitted during the hearing it could not show the
financial wherewithal to stay in business and meet state standards
for the entire two-year license period. Instead, the company's
lawyers asked the commission to be flexible and let the casino stay
in business long enough to sell out.
   But Read said to do so would compromise the credibility of the
state's vigorous casino regulations and heighten the risk of
unethical conduct by the casino's strapped management. Read cited
testimony by McKee acknowledging that the casino on occasion failed
to maintain the state-required minimum in its reserve to pay off
winnings.
   ``The conclusion is inescapable that ... if we were to grant
relicensure, these standards would be rendered meaningless,'' Read
said.
   Anthony Parrillo, director of the Division of Gaming
Enforcement, called it a ``somber day'' for the casino but hailed
the denial as the right move for the health of New Jersey's gaming
industry.
   ``If the case shows anything, it shows that regulatory
credentials have to predominate over economic consequences,'' he
said.
   The commissioners admitted the conservator issue was unexplored
territory fraught with hazards. And despite the 4-1 vote for
conservatorship, the commissioners delayed until next week the
decision of who the conservator would be and what powers one would
possess. It was unclear how the arrangement would affect efforts to
sell the casino.
   ``There are so many questions that have to be answered. It could
really be a fiscal minefield,'' Commissioner Frank Dodd, the lone
dissenter, told reporters earlier in the day. He said it might be
preferable to padlock the casino.
   Another possible outcome is protection from the bankruptcy
court, where Elsinore first turned in 1985.
   Company lawyers earlier in the week urged a federal bankruptcy
court in Camden to intervene and keep the Atlantis in business. The
judge declined immediate action but agreed to consider the matter
next Tuesday.
   In the commission hearing, Elsinore claimed the best hopes for
the casino's creditors rested with a decision to keep the casino
open under the current ownership. The casino said any chance of
fetching a fair selling price would be spoiled by a closing or
appointment of a conservator.
   Mrs. Hood testified earlier in the week that several prospective
buyers have surfaced and that a sale likely could be completed in
coming months.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Friday he plans to deny a
request to dismiss securities fraud charges against Singer Co.
chairman and takeover specialist Paul A. Bilzerian.
   U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward also said at a hearing that
he would refuse to move the case, scheduled for a trial beginning
May 1, to federal court in Tampa, Fla., where Bilzerian lives.
   The judge indicated he would drop one of 12 counts in an
indictment handed up by a federal grand jury last December, but
said he would not make a formal ruling on any of the matters until
Tuesday.
   Bilzerian, 38, is accused of violating securities and tax laws,
conspiracy and making false statements to the government in
connection with four securities transactions in 1985 and 1986.
   The government contends that Bilzerian made millions of dollars
by accumulating stock in takeover targets, concealing ownership of
the stocks in secret accounts and then selling his holdings after
the stock price had risen.
   Much of the government's case is derived from information
supplied to the government by Los Angeles broker Boyd L. Jefferies,
who has admitted to two felonies for violating federal securities
laws.
   Jefferies also supplied information for the government's stock
manipulation case against GAF Corp., which ended in a second
mistrial last month.
   Bilzerian faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and a
$250,000 fine on each count.

   Under the agreement, Adams would transfer its KZOK-FM station to
Fisher and its KQUL-AM station to Viacom.
   Fisher owns KOMO-AM in Seattle. Viacom owns Seattle-Tacoma radio
station KBSG-FM.
   No terms of the deal were disclosed.

   NWA Inc., parent company of Northwest
Airlines, on Friday rejected a $2.62 billion bid by Los Angeles
billionaire Marvin Davis to acquire the airline concern, but Davis
vowed to continue his efforts.
   The NWA board based its decision on advice from its financial
adviser that Davis' $90-a-share offer was inadequate. The board
reaffirmed its intention to maintain the airline as an independent
entity.
   ``Our board has carefully considered Mr. Davis' proposal as well
as numerous other financial and strategic alternatives available to
NWA. It is clear that Mr. Davis' proposal does not fully reflect
the value of NWA,'' said Steve Rothmeier, chairman and chief
executive officer of NWA.
   Davis, whose bid was set to expire April 21, has insisted his
bid is friendly and that he would not sell off parts of the company.
   ``We have a strong, serious interest in owning NWA. In that
regard, we are in the process of completing financing arrangements
for the acquisition and expect to be in a position to describe them
shortly,'' a spokesman for Davis, Jim Fingeroth, said after the NWA
board rejected Davis' bid.
   The board's decision was announced after the stock market
closed. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, NWA fell 50
cents a share to close at $88.75 on Friday.
   Davis announced his bid about a week ago, several days after NWA
disclosed that an investor group whose identity has still not been
revealed had a 4.9 percent stake in the company.
   In the NWA statement, Rothmeier said Northwest's value is
demonstrated by recent federal airline performance statistics and
the company's expectations for earnings growth.
   ``First, according to U.S. Department of Transportation
statistics, our airline achieved excellent on-time and customer
satisfaction during the last quarter. Second, we expect NWA's
first-quarter earnings to be at record levels,'' Rothmeier said in
a statement.
   ``Our confidence in NWA's potential is combined with a
realization that our shareholders, employees and customers are just
beginning to see the benefits of our acquisition of Republic,'' he
said. ``In light of these considerations, the board has concluded
that it is not appropriate to seek a sale of NWA.''
   Kurt Rivard, an analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis,
said NWA's anticipated record first-quarter earnings would make a
$90 a share offer inadequate and will figure significantly in
future takeover discussions.
   ``This sets a basis for a re-evaluation of earnings estimates up
and given that it would make the premium that would someone would
have to pay to acquire the company higher,'' Rivard said.
   ``Northwest has not made money in the first quarter since 1985
and the reason for that is the airline business, especially for an
international carrier, is very seasonal. Yields are also weak
during that period,'' he said.
   Davis intends to proceed aggressively, said Fingeroth, who is
with the New York public relations firm of Kekst and Co.
   ``We are disappointed that the board has rejected this very
generous offer without even exploring it with us especially in view
of our expressed willingness to consider a higher price if
additional value can be demonstrated,'' he said.
   In Washington, Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., told reporters that
in a meeting he held earlier Friday with Davis, the would-be
purchaser described his financial plan to him and that he believed
the suitor's proposal was ``a very attractive offer.''
   The lawmaker said despite the rejection by the NWA board, the
proposal was one that ``would not burden the airline with an
unacceptable debt load.''
   Oberstar said Davis had told him it would be ``financial folly''
to sell any of the carrier's assets, that he would not seek salary
or benefit concessions from employees, and that he would establish
a major maintenance facility in Minnesota for the European-made
Airbus aircraft Northwest is purchasing.
   The maintenance base would provide 1,000 to 1,500 jobs, the
legislator said.
   According to Oberstar, Davis will meet soon with Northwest union
leaders.
   Oberstar said Davis would reveal the details of his financial
plan to the public next Wednesday. The lawmaker said making the
plan public might help Davis because NWA board had not yet seen the
specifics of his financing.
   The congressman said he was not endorsing Davis' offer, but he
added, ``This is a very attractive offer and we ought to think
about it very seriously.''
   Oberstar, chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, said he
met with the NWA suitor aboard Davis' Boeing 727 jet at the airport
in Nashville, Tenn. Oberstar, who said he inititated the meeting,
had traveled to Nashville to address a convention.

   Media giant Southam Inc. may join forces with
Torstar Corp. to make a foray into the newspaper and publishing
business in the United States, Southam's president said Thursday.
   ``There is this relationship between the two companies, there is
the ability to do something,'' John Fisher told reporters after a
speech to the Toronto Society of Financial Analysts.
   Fisher said nothing definite has been planned with Torstar,
which holds a 22.4 percent interest in Southam, Canada's largest
newspaper publisher based on circulation. The Southam family holds
22.2 per cent.
   In 1985, Torstar, which publishes the Toronto Star and owns
other businesses, came to Southam's rescue, buying into the company
and promising to vote in support of the Southam board to thwart a
takeover bid by an unidentified company. The deal expires June 30
next year.
   Southam may decide to make its own deals, specifically in the
newspaper, commercial printing or business information fields,
Fisher said.
   He refused to indicate when and where acquisitions may take
place.
   The newspaper arm of the publishing firm owns 16 daily
newspapers, including the Ottawa Citizen, the Vancouver Sun and the
Montreal Gazette, as well as about a dozen weeklies.
   Southam also operates Southam Printing Ltd., one of Canada's
largest commercial printers, 200 Coles bookstores and Southam
Communications Ltd.

<HEAD>Pittston Says Mines Are Operating</HEAD>

   The Pittston Co. said it continued to
operate most of its Virginia and West Virginia coal mines Thursday,
the first full day of a strike by 1,400 members of the United Mine
Workers union.
   Pittston Co. spokeswoman Susan Copeland said that the company
would not release details about which facilities were working.
   ``We are operating most of them,'' Copeland said. ``They're not
all up to par, but they will be. But we won't be outlining which
operations we are operating and which we are not.''
   The UMW said members of 22 local unions were called out on
strike at 4 p.m. Wednesday. Pittston operations in Kentucky and
some small operations in Virginia and West Virginia were not
included in the work stoppage. UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran said that
may change.
   Some 1,700 miners in the three states have been working without
a contract for 14 months, since the 1984 national agreement expired
on Jan. 31, 1988.
   Corcoran said the union would like Pittston to reconsider its
plan to bring in replacements for the strikers. He said he was not
hopeful that they would.
   ``It's very easy to take advantage of the unemployment in
Appalachia,'' Corcoran said. ``It seems they'd just as soon pit an
unemployed miner against another miner on strike. They don't care.''
   Negotiations are due to resume in Washington next week,
according to Corcoran. Talks that had been scheduled for Thursday
and Friday of this week were postponed at the company's request, he
said.

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ A state judge issued an order Friday
blocking the acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., but RJR officials said he later limited his ruling
to the company's assets in Switzerland.
   Forsyth County District Court Judge James Harrill Jr. issued the
restraining order and set an April 17 hearing on a motion by Swiss
investors to block the merger.
   Harrill granted the order in connection with a suit filed in
Switzerland that charges the buyout hurt investors by improperly
diminishing the value of RJR Nabisco bonds.
   Later Friday, an RJR Nabisco spokeswoman said the judge had
clarified his order.
   ``The North Carolina court's clarified order holds that in light
of a prior modification to the March 20 order by the civil court in
Basel, Switzerland, the North Carolina order does not prohibit the
merger of RJR Nabisco's assets located outside Switzerland,'' said
spokeswoman Pauline Howes.
   ``In essence, they narrowed the scope of the order
considerably,'' she said. ``It now applies only to assets located
inside the country of Switzerland.''
   RJR Nabisco officials said they did not believe the court action
would have any impact on the closing of the deal.
   The record $24.53 billion acquisition is expected to be
finalized some time after an RJR Nabisco shareholders' meeting
scheduled for April 27. The exact date of the closing is not yet
known.
   The Swiss suit is one of several claiming the buyout
significantly reduced the value of RJR Nabisco bonds.
   At least three insurance companies _ including Jefferson-Pilot
Corp., Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and the insurance
subsidiaries of ITT Corp. _ have sued the company, claiming the
market value of bonds they held fell 20 percent after former
company chairman Ross Johnson proposed a leveraged buyout in
October.
   Johnson's proposal started the bidding war eventually won by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
