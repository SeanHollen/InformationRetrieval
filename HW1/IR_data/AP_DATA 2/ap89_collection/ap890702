   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving Earth, Voyager 2 is converging on
Neptune, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager
at the National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on Neptune that may be
a giant storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at 9 p.m. PDT on Aug. 24, Voyager will swoop within 3,000 miles of
Neptune's north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from Earth after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, Voyager will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, Triton. The other known
moon is Nereid.
   Voyager 1 and 2, laden with TV cameras and an array of sensors,
were launched from Cape Canaveral in 1977. They visited Jupiter in
1979 and Saturn in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Voyager 2 reached
Uranus in 1986. Voyager 1 now is heading toward interstellar space.
   Voyager 1 and 2 returned 65,000 photographs of Jupiter, Saturn
and their moons and rings. Voyager 2 sent back 8,000 pictures of
Uranus and its moons, and will take another 8,000 of Neptune.
   At a cost Haynes pegged at $865 million through the Neptune
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to NASA.
   Neptune, discovered in 1846, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times Earth's size and the fourth largest planet after Jupiter,
Saturn and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of Pluto's elongated orbit
Neptune will be the ninth and outermost until 2007.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist Ellis Miner.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting Neptune, said
physicist Ed Stone, NASA's Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at California Institute of Technology.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from Earth, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above Neptune's clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study Neptune's weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
Earth's hurricanes or Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving Neptune's storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
Neptune _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, Stone said.
   Despite any internal heat, Neptune receives 900 times less
sunlight than Earth, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on Triton,
Stone said.
   Scientists believe Triton _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of Earth's moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. Triton's reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, Stone said.
   Triton probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from Earth indicate Triton's atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, Stone said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
Triton?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe Triton has extreme seasons because its orbit
around Neptune is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean Triton's
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that Triton has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, Stone said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist Peter Goldreich speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
Triton or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that Neptune has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like Earth's, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around Neptune similar to Earth's Van Allen belts. Jupiter's
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; Haynes doubts
similar problems at Neptune.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to Voyager, and photos and information it sends to
Earth, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. NASA is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in New Mexico, California, Australia, Spain and Japan to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
2020, NASA said.
   After Neptune, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

   Imagine a 20-watt
refrigerator light bulb burning in the dark, 2.75 billion miles away.
   Now imagine the sophisticated eyes needed to see the light.
   Voyager 2, heading for Neptune, is emitting 20 watts of radio
signals, information coded in binary bits _ ones and zeros _ on the
space probe's health and from its scientific instruments and cameras.
   ``Think of that lightbulb as flickering, and that flickering
contains the information that Voyager is sending back to us,'' said
Bill Brundage, Voyager preparation manager for the Very Large Array
radio telescope.
   The signals have become fainter since Voyager's encounters with
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. The signals, and
commands sent to the 12-year-old probe, take four hours and six
minutes to cross 2.75 billion miles at the speed of light. Larger
antennas and more sensitive receivers are needed on Earth to receive
the signals, and more power is needed to transmit commands to the
craft, which will pass fly within 3,000 miles of Neptune on Aug. 24.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Deep Space
Network is used to talk to Voyager. The DSN has three complexes:
Goldstone in California's Mojave Desert; Madrid, Spain; and
Tidbinbilla, Australia, near Canberra.
   When Voyager flew by Uranus, the California and Australian
listening posts used three antenna dishes each _ one 210 feet across
and two 112 feet _ and the Madrid station used one of each, said
Mary Beth Murrill, a spokeswoman for the NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. The Canberra complex also was linked
to Australia's 210-foot Parkes Radio Astronomy Telescope.
   For Neptune, the 210-foot dishes at Goldstone, Canberra and
Madrid have been increased to 230 feet and another 112-foot antenna
was built at Madrid. In addition, the VLA is being used in
conjunction with Goldstone, Parkes again is linked with Canberra,
and a Japanese telescope will be added to the network.
   The different sites ensure that at least one station can
communicate with the spacecraft despite the Earth's rotation,
Brundage said.
   ``The VLA alone gives us almost a third more images than if we
didn't have it,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager at JPL.
   The VLA is a one-of-a-kind space-age erector set sitting on an
ancient lake bed. The site is skirted by four mountain ranges,
protecting it from much of the electronic interference from
television, radios, aircraft and the like.
   It consists of 27 white dish-shaped antennas, each 82 feet in
diameter, 92 feet high and weighing 235 tons. The dishes sit on the
Plains of San Augustin amid tumbleweed, cattle and sparse vegetation
at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
   The dishes are arranged along three arms of railroad track, laid
out in the shape of a Y. Two arms are 13 miles long and the third is
11.8 miles. The Earth rotates the Y like a turntable, creating
images that have the same detail as if using a radio telescope up to
26 miles in diameter.
   A special 36-wheel transporter moves each antenna to one of 72
observation stations along the three arms. This acts like a zoom
lens _ the farther out the dishes, the higher the resolution; the
closer in, the larger the field of view.
   NASA spent $6.5 million to equip each dish to receive Voyager's
signals. It also set up special techniques and installed two big
diesel generators to guard against lightning-caused power
fluctuations during the thunderstorm season.
   The separation of the listening posts around the world _ just
like the separation of the VLA dishes _ strengthen the sensitivity
of the network. The signal VLA gets from Voyager is sent via
satellite to Goldstone, where the two signals are combined, decoded
and sent via microwave to JPL in Pasadena.

<TEXT>
   The young woman's enthusiasm was
contagious. ``I did it, I did it,'' she said, smiling broadly and
barely standing still after casting her first vote in a democratic
election.
   The right to vote is taken for granted _ and often ignored _ in
countries with a longer tradition of rule by and for the people.
   But in Eastern Europe, brutalized by 50 years of war, Stalinism,
police repression, false propaganda and economic mismanagement, that
simple act in the Polish national elections June 4 seemed nothing
short of a miracle.
   Communist rule came to Eastern Europe as the result of the World
War II military might of the Soviet Union, but perestroika and
glasnost under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are giving
countries that used to be referred to as ``satellites'' the leeway
to experiment with democracy.
   Economic pressures are also helping the cause of political
reforms.
   With communist economies proven unable to compete with the West
in a high-technology age, the ideological rationale for
Marxism-Leninism _ that it makes life better for the common man and
woman _ has been stripped away.
   In the course of one or two years, the concept of free
competition among different political parties has gone from being an
unimaginable dream to being hoped for and even counted on in Poland
and Hungary.
   Poles and Hungarians will even get a rare, firsthand look at the
leader of a Western democracy this month, when President Bush stops
to visit prior to the annual summit of industrialized democracies in
Paris.
   Bush will find a Poland that has just held the first democratic
parliamentary elections since World War II, in which candidates
backed by the Solidarity movement took 99 of the 100 seats.
   The elections to the Sejm were not free; the opposition was
allowed only to run for 35 percent of the seats. Solidarity took all
161 of those. Its platform: Remove the party's ``leading role'' and
hold free elections in four years.
   In Hungary, that might be too slow. A commission is working to
draft a constitution expected to provide for fully free multiparty
elections as early as next year. It also will guarantee free speech,
independent courts and other human rights.
   The rapid pace of democratic change in Hungary was underlined by
the reburial with honors June 16 of Imre Nagy, leader of the 1956
anti-Soviet revolt, who was executed for treason. Hundreds of
thousands of people were on hand for the ceremony and joined a
veteran of 1956 in swearing: ``We will never again be slaves.''
   Party leaders in Poland and Hungary have been quoted as saying
they hope the Communist Party will win planned free elections in the
future, but if not, the party will accept the voters' verdict and
relinquish power.
   In Poland, the opposition is led by Lech Walesa and the
Solidarity movement which embraces workers, intellectuals and much
of the powerful Roman Catholic Church. In Hungary, reform is mainly
the work of intellectuals, including a potent liberal wing of the
communist party itself.
   Both countries already have seen the spontaneous reformation of
long-banned political parties and associations, as if they only were
in suspended animation for the past half century. There also are
totally new political grouping, such as environmentally conscious
``Greens.''
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, democratization is not so advanced,
where it exists at all. What is happening in Poland and Hungary has
raised hopes among some citizens while disquieting the mostly aging
leaderships.
   East Germany and Romania, the most hardline states, have
commented with dismay on Hungary's move toward democracy. ``Under
the flag of `renewing socialism,' forces are at work that strive for
removing socialism,'' said East German Politburo member Joachim
Herrman. Romania said the ceremonies to honor Nagy were ``clearly
fascist, anti-socialist in nature.''
   Both countries brook no dissent. In Romania, dissidents are
jailed while in East Germany they are likely to find themselves
deported to the West.
   In Prague, the Czechoslovak leadership has paid enthusiastic lip
service to the Kremlin reforms, but failed so far to implement them
amid an ongoing, if secretive debate about whether change is needed.
   In Bulgaria, leader Todor Zhivkov remains true to a lifetime of
skillfully aping whatever policy holds sway in Moscow. In July 1987,
he embraced economic reform, exciting Bulgaria's intelligentsia and
younger technocrats.
   But Zhivkov and longtime comrades on the ruling Poltiburo blocked
dissent within the party last year. Dissident groups, the first seen
in four decades of communist rule, are closely watched by security
forces and troublemakers are expelled.
   In Yugoslavia, the communist party leadership in Slovenia, the
most economically advanced of the country's six republics, has
tolerated a broad degree of pluralism, while rejecting demands for
multiparty democracy from mushrooming independent groups. Those
calls have been echoed by intellectuals in Croatia and Servia, the
two largest republics, but ethnic tensions among the republics have
complicated any broad alliance for reform.
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, however, uses authoritarian
tactics and insists on one-party, orthodox communist rule, putting
him at odds with other republics _ particularly the Slovenes, who
are now threatening secession if conflicts go unresolved.

   Thunderstorms packing 90 mph gusts roared through northern Texas
late Sunday, and rivers continued to rise in Louisiana and
Mississippi.
   The flooding, the aftermath of record rainfall from Tropical
Storm Allison, could continue for weeks, meteorolgists said.
   Dallas fire officials received reports of two tornadoes touching
down. The storms knocked down power lines, leaving about 50,000
homes without electricity, authorities said.
   About a dozen mobile homes near Lake Worth were knocked off
foundations and struck by wind-blown trees, said Fort Worth Fire
Department spokesman Walter McConnell.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   In Louisiana, at least 700 homes and numerous roads remained
flooded, with scattered storms and showers replacing the unremitting
rain of the previous five days. One town got nearly 29 inches of
rain in less than a week.
   A tornado destroyed a taxidermy business and 70 mph winds swept
the outskirts of Alexandria, in the central part of Louisiana, said
Sgt. Anthony Ribaudo of the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Department.
   Ribaudo said he couldn't tell if the storm would worsen flooding
in the area.
   ``It's already so bad one more storm doesn't seem like
anything,'' he said.
   An earthen dam in another rural part of the state was reported
near collapse, and most residents near it had evacuated.
   In Alexandria, a 12-year-old boy died when he jumped into a
storm-flooded ditch and was sucked into a culvert Saturday
afternoon, one of three deaths blamed on the storm, authorities
said. Four deaths were blamed on the storm in Texas.
   In Mississippi, authorities braved rain and lightning to search
for a teen-ager missing after he and a companion went swimming in a
swollen creek.
   The body of the companion was recovered early Sunday near
Natchez, on the east bank of the Mississippi.
   About 180 miles north, about 200 people were evacuated from
Coahoma County homes as a flood swept through their neighborhoods.
   During the night, Allison's leftover rain and thunderstorms moved
slowly eastward and shifted the heavy rain pattern into the
Tennessee and Ohio valleys.
   The National Weather Service said fields and timberland were
likely to stay flooded for weeks because there was nowhere for all
the water to go.
   ``The Red River itself is at bank-full from Grand Ecore
downstream to Alexandria and below,'' said Ernest Ethridge, a
weather service meteorologist in Shreveport.
   ``All these tributaries that received the torrential rains are
unable to empty their water into the main channel,'' he said. ``So
it spreads out, becomes a big lake.''
   At least 10 parishes _ Louisiana's equivalent of counties _ got
12 to 15 inches of rain, he said, with 20 inches or more measured in
Winn and Natchitoches parishes. He said some lakes and rivers
crested Sunday and others were expected to do so Monday or later.
All were flooding, he said.
   In Winn Parish, about 70 miles southeast of Shreveport, deputies
kept watch on the deteriorating Mirror Lake Dam, which initially had
been expected to collapse by daybreak.
   ``It's doing better than we thought it would. But it's not going
to hold long,'' said Deputy Benjamin Phelps. ``Some trees that were
holding it yesterday washed out during the night. Now it's just
dirt.''
   He said no evacuation had been ordered, but most of the people in
the 50 or so homes nearby left on their own.
   ``There's people getting smart and getting out,'' he said.
   About 100 houses were evacuated around Saline Lake, along the
western edge of the parish.
   Downstream, authorities estimated that the flooded lake Saline
Lake, where about 100 houses were evacuated, would rise at least an
extra foot if the Mirror Lake Dam broke.
   Winnfield got the week's worst rain _ 28.75 inches since
Wednesday.
   ``The sun's out ... and the water's receding at the present,''
said Mayor Max Kelley. However, he said, more storms were expected
and the Dugdemona River had not yet crested. About 100 houses were
flooded in the town.
   ``I would imagine our economy is going to suffer,'' he said.
   At the weather service, Ethridge said Winnfield got 32 inches of
rain in June _ the wettest month on record and 7 inches above the
previous record, set in December 1983. Shreveport had its wettest
June ever, with 17.01 inches of rain. He said lowland flooding would
continue to increase for the next few days, and then probably remain
for a couple of weeks.

<TEXT>
   The governor of Missouri told
anti-abortion lobbyists Saturday that legalized abortion contributes
to dropouts, suicides and low self-esteem among youth.
   Gov. John Ashcroft, speaking to the National Right to Life
Committee's annual convention two days before the Supreme Court was
expected to rule on a Missouri case that could determine the future
of legalized abortion in America, said abortions contributed to a
``vacuum of values'' among the youth.
   ``What kind of signal are we as a society sending them about the
value of life? We need to send an unmistakable message that there is
a fundamental value in life itself,'' he said.
   The law being reviewed by the Supreme Court puts restrictions on
abortions and defines life as beginning at conception. Upholding the
Missouri law, or even parts of it, could reverse or seriously erode
the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   ``The Roe decision is simply a miserable failure,'' Ashcroft
said, drawing loud applause. ``And I hope that the Supreme Court
announces it is overturning the Roe decision and giving back to the
states the right to make public policy.''
   The court has said it may rule Monday on the case, Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services, or delay its decision for further
review.
   Earlier Saturday, U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., told delegates
they must not become complacent in light of victories the movement
has achieved over the last 20 years.
   ``We've got to regroup. We've got to rededicate. We've got to
realize that the fight is just beginning,'' Smith said.
   ``Over the past two decades, our message has been getting
through. Our efforts are bearing fruit. Without us, it would have
gotten worse,'' said Smith, one of three congressmen with strong
anti-abortion records in the House.
   In the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb of Robbinsdale, meanwhile,
about 300 protesters on both sides of the issue picketed and sang
Saturday morning outside a clinic where abortions are performed.
   Dixie Riley of the National Organization for Women said NOW
representatives were on hand ``to make sure that the women can get
into the clinic and exercise their constitutional right _ for as
long as it lasts. We all know the Roe v. Wade decision is being
reconsidered.''
   Reps. James Oberstar, D-Minn., and Henry Hyde, R-Ill., also
addressed the group.
   ``America ... has been called a disposable society, but that
shouldn't include people,'' Oberstar said.
   Many religious groups support the anti-abortion position, he said.
   ``But there is more than religion alone to guide us in this issue
because there's incontrovertible medical and biological evidence
that life begins at conception,'' the congressman said.
   Hyde said abortion is just another indication of decay in the
morals of America. The high incidence of alcoholism and drug abuse
and the lack of religious guidance for many people are other
indications, he said.
   ``The moral infrastructure of America has broken down,'' Hyde
said. ``We must be the rebuilders.''
   ``The greatest civil right, the greatest human right of all, is
the right to life,'' he said.

   A bomb exploded early Sunday at a
crowded exhibition attended by President Ranasinghe Premadasa and
senior members of his Cabinet, but they escaped injury, police said.
   However, at least one person was killed and 30 were wounded, they
said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which occurred
shortly after midnight at a government-sponsored exhibition in
Mahiyangana, 70 miles northeast of Colombo.
   But police blamed members of the People's Liberation Front, a
left-wing ethnic Sinhalese group trying to overthrow the
Sinhalese-dominated government.
   Also Sunday, security forces in the south arrested 3,237
Sinhalese youths suspected of belonging to the front, according to a
police official in Colombo.
   It was the largest such crackdown against the group in nearly two
years, said the officer, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules.
   The front has been blamed for more than 3,500 killings since July
1987, when Indian peacekeeping forces arrived on this Indian Ocean
island to enforce a peace accord between the government and the
Tamil minority.
   The front contends the accord grants too many concessions to the
Tamils and the Indian soldiers threaten Sri Lankan sovereignty.
Front members have vowed to kill anyone who supports the pact.
   Last month, Premadasa asked India to pull out its troops by the
end of July. India refused, saying a quick withdrawal could stir
even more ethnic violence.
   India sent troops to Sri Lanka under a peace accord signed by
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Premadasa's predecessor,
Junius R. Jayewardene. The accord proposed to give Tamils limited
autonomy in exchange for surrendering their weapons, but militant
Tamils rejected it.
   Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
contend they suffer job and educational discrimination. Sinhalese
make up 75 percent of the population.

   In the office of Kenneth Carr, the new chairman
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, hangs a small framed copy of a
once-secret message that reminds him both of atomic power's promise
a generation ago and its troubles today.
   ``Under way on nuclear power,'' says the flash from the USS
Nautilus, signalling the launching of the maiden voyage of the first
vessel in the world to be propelled by a nuclear reactor. The date
was Jan. 17, 1955, and Carr was a crew member.
   He remembers that historic moment as a high-water mark in the
military use of nuclear power.
   A generation later, Carr, 64, is taking the helm of the NRC with
the commercial nuclear power industry at a low ebb, crippled in
large part by a widespread public fear of the atom _ a fear Carr
says is irrational but powerful and enduring.
   From his first day Monday as chairman of the federal agency that
regulates commercial nuclear power, Carr says he intends to press
the search for ways of overcoming public opposition to nuclear
plants. He has no illusions of quick success.
   ``I think it's going to be a generational change before you get
the public acceptance,'' he said in a recent interview.
   No electric utility has ordered a nuclear plant in this country
since 1978, and even nuclear power's biggest advocates see no sign
of the drought ending soon.
   Public opposition isn't the only reason for nuclear's stagnation,
but Carr thinks it's the one obstacle most deeply rooted in the
history of atomic power.
   Today's adult population, he says, was introduced to nuclear
power in an era in which strict secrecy, not public education, was
the watchword of nuclear's promoters and regulators. The result was
a mystic of little-understood danger.
   ``We tried to keep it bottled up, keep the genie in the bottle,
even long after it was out,'' Carr says, noting a determination of
the Truman and Eisenhower administrations to guard American nuclear
know-how not only from the Soviet Union and other potential U.S.
enemies but also friendly nations and even the American public.
   ``I think we didn't do a good job at all of educating the
public,'' he says.
   Carr is a native of Kentucky. He retired from the Navy as a vice
admiral in 1985, last serving as deputy and chief of staff to the
commander in chief Atlantic Command and the commander in chief of
the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.
   He was a crewman on an assault landing craft in the Pacific
theater during World War II. Later he was appointed to the U.S.
Naval Academy as a member of the class of 1949. Among his honors are
the Distinguished Service Medal and Legion of Merit.
   His experience in the nuclear Navy gave Carr firsthand knowledge
of the nuclear secrecy he now bemoans.
   Even more basic to Americans' unease about the atom, he says, is
a lingering memory of the stunning destruction caused by the only
two nuclear bombs ever dropped _ on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki in August 1945.
   ``That's what our generation sees when the words `nuclear' and
`atomic' come; they see that big ball over there and they see that
picture of that one building standing there in the rubble,'' he says.
   The only thing that will change that, Carr believes, is the
passage of time and a stronger effort by government and industry to
teach young people about nuclear energy. If they fully understand
it, he says, they won't fear it.
   Carr is replacing another retired Navy officer, Lando Zech Jr.,
as NRC chairman. He has high praise for Zech, who served with Carr
on the USS Nautilus for two years and has been a close associate
since Carr became an NRC commissioner in 1986.
   ``Now he's leaving me _ bailed out on me,'' Carr says, using the
maritime lingo that frequently flavors his speech.
   During the two years he expects to spend as chairman, Carr says
his top goal will be to set the ground rules for deciding whether to
extend the operating licenses of U.S. nuclear plants.
   The licenses of existing plants are good for 40 years, and the
first expirations will come toward the end of the century. Decisions
must be made soon, he says, because utilities need at least 10 years
lead time to replace their plants if it's decided that four decades
of use make the reactors too dangerous to keep using.

   Police at an international youth
festival seized Danish and Finnish human rights banners, and some
European delegates Sunday accused North Korea of using the festival
for self-promotion.
   More than 15,000 people from 180 countries are in Pyongyang for
the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, the biggest
international gathering ever staged by the communist government.
   The banners were seized at the opening cremonies Saturday.
   The Danish banner read ``Human rights in North Korea too,'' while
Finland's banner protested North Korea's refusal to allow the human
rights group Amnesty International to attend the one-week event.
   The Finn delegation had decided to drop out of the festival to
protest the confiscation but reversed its decision Sunday, after
North Korea apologized and said two Amnesty International
representatives would be given visas to attend.
   Matti Tohianen of the Finnish delegation said police hit the
hands of the four students carrying the banner and grabbed it during
opening ceremonies.
   North Korea apparently balked at allowing Amnesty representation
because the group has criticized North Korea's human rights record.
   The Danish delegation also was considering pulling out of the
festival after police briefly detained three of its members for
unfurling the human rights banner during a speech by President Kim
Il Sung.
   The Union of Nordic Center Youth issued a statement saying the
confiscation of banners was ``not within the spirit of the
festival.''
   Other delegates said they had received letters from the North
Koreans warning they would be held personally responsible for any
actions at the opening ceremony that were critical of the host
country or other participants.
   A Norwegian delegate said her group smuggled in a banner
expressing solidarity with the suppressed Chinese pro-democracy
movement.
   The Finnish delegates also circulated a statement calling for the
Chinese government to ``respect the freedom of expression and stop
the ongoing arrests and executions.''
   North Korea has supported China's crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in that country. Twenty-seven people have been executed
since the movement was crushed by the military last month.
   Rachel Kyte, a representative of the European National Youth
Council, said her group was ``not happy'' about the staging of the
festival in North Korea, one of the world's most closed and tightly
controlled nations.
   She complained about the ``orchestrated chanting of national
slogans'' at the opening ceremony, in which 70,000 North Koreans
performed in a three-hour music, dance and light show.
   Tor-Hugne Olsen, a member of the International Federation of
Liberal and Radical Youth, called for a ban on opening and closing
ceremonies.
   ``We want festivals to be international events, and not events of
the host country,'' he said.
   The festival, last held in Moscow in 1985, brings together youth
from socialist countries and mainly leftist organizations to discuss
political topics and stage various art, theatrical and sports shows.
The festival organizers refused to put the China events on the
agenda.
   North Korea has set out to use the festival to show the world it
can stage an international event as successfully as the rival South
Korean government, which was host to the Summer Olympics in Seoul
last year.
   Dozens of new stadiums, hotels and apartments have been built,
and many of Pyongyang's 2 million people have been mobilized to
prepare or participate in the festival.
   In South Korea, about 1,000 radical students gathered at Seoul's
Yonsei University on Sunday to protest the government ban on
participation in the youth festival.
   Relations have been strained between the two Koreas since the
Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 into the communist North and
capitalist South. The countries fought a war from 1950 to 1953 and
remain bitter enemies.

   More than 5,000 doctors at state-run
hospitals ended a 47-day-old strike Sunday that had paralyzed
medical care to the city's poor.
   The doctors are to return to work Monday, according to
negotiators for the government and the Junior Doctors Federation.
   The agreement ending the strike was signed following negotiations
that stretched through the night. The doctors had demanded pay
raises, higher allowances for not being allowed to maintain private
practices, and schedules for promotion.
   Under the agreement, the doctors will receive raises of $25 a
month, less than half they had sought. Their monthly salaries
average $200 to $269.

   Government troops clashed with
communist guerrillas in a village near the U.S.-run Clark Air Base,
and eight rebels and a government soldier were killed, the military
reported Sunday.
   Four soldiers were wounded in the battle Saturday near Angeles
City, 50 miles northwest of Manila, a report from the Philippine
Constabulary headquarters in Manila said.
   Troops recovered six M-16 rifles and rebel documents from the
slain New People's Army guerrillas, the report said.
   The rebels were surrounded at a house in Duquit village, about a
mile from the air base. The house had been under surveillance for
some time, said a constabulary soldier who requested anonymity. The
soldier was contacted by telephone from Angeles City, home of Clark
Air Base.
   He said the rebels fired first and troops retaliated after
ordering civilians out of the house. He quoted officials as saying
the rebels could have been preparing for operations in the city to
coincide with July 4 celebrations. July 4 also is celebrated in the
Philippines as Fil-American Friendship Day.
   The New People's Army has been fighting 20 years to set up a
Marxist system in the Philippines. It also wants the removal of U.S.
military facilities from the Philippines.
   In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino of
U.S. descent during a series of ambushes outside Clark Air Base.

   Investigating officers, who asked not to be identified by name,
said the motive for the killings was unknown.
   They said Rudoljus Wilhelmus Maria was found hanging from a

discovered by the family maid in a second-floor room. Both
reportedly had multiple stab wounds.
   Police said his wife also was stabbed and was in a coma at a
Bangkok hospital.
   Police said that Maria held a management position with the
Philips Electrical Co. of Thailand, a Dutch-owned company.
   The police reports said the family was due to return to the
Netherlands soon. Maria's wife was reportedly suffering from cancer.

   A bus skidded on a wet highway and
plunged 900 feet down an embankment, killing 56 people, authorities
said Sunday.
   More than 20 people were hospitalized, some with severe injuries,
police and press reports said.
   The bus was carrying workers home from the Natal province town of
Harding to the tribal homeland of Transkei on South Africa's
southeast coast when it skidded off the road about 2:30 p.m.
Saturday, police said. As many as 100 people were aboard, according
to one newspaper report.
   It reportedly was raining at the time of the accident.
   The South African Broadcast Corp. put the death toll at 56. It
quoted Lew Corbett, traffic chief at Port Shepstone, as saying the
bus left the road and overturned, then tumbled into the ravine.
   Another police report quoted by the network said the top of the
bus was sheared off as it fell.
   The South African Press Association said all the victims were
black and included some children. It said at least three people were
unhurt, including the driver and bus conductor.
   The injured were taken to hospitals in Harding and the coastal
town of Port Shepstone, each about 10 miles from the scene. Some of
the most serious cases were brought to Durban, 60 miles to the
northeast.
   Buses used to carry workers are frequently overloaded and not
well maintained.
   The crash was the second serious bus accident in the country in
two days. On Friday, eight people were killed and 53 hurt when a bus
ran off a road and overturned near the Numbi gate entrance of Kruger
National Park, a wildlife reserve.

<HEAD>Deborah Gore Dean: There to Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The letter to Deborah Gore Dean, an aide to the
secretary of Housing and Urban Development, didn't waste any words.
   ``Dear Debbie,'' it began.
   ``HELP!
   ``Paul''
   Paul Goulding, a financial consultant who was working on behalf
of a community organization, said he was at the end of his rope that
July day a few years ago.
   In his case, the plea did not work. In many others, it did.
   An examination of Ms. Dean's correspondence during her years at
the top of HUD shows that help was her business _ particularly for
certain developers and well-connected Republican consultants.
   Relatively few of the hundreds of letters released by HUD were
signed by Ms. Dean. However, accompanying documents show that she
gave the final approval to many letters over the signature of her
boss, then-housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. They were then
signed by a machine at her command.
   Ms. Dean, 34, is at the center of investigations of influence
peddling at HUD, where she has been identified as the person who
controlled millions of dollars for housing rehabilitation.
   She has refused to testify before a congressional panel
investigating HUD, citing her constitutional right against self
incrimination.
   And aside from earlier interviews with The Wall Street Journal,
she has avoided contact with the news media. Last week, when she
accidentally answered a call at her lawyer's office from The
Associated Press, she politely but firmly declined to talk and
quickly put her attorney on the phone.
   Her rise through the ranks at the department was stymied only by
the Senate, which derailed her nomination to be assistant HUD
secretary. But it was from her post as executive assistant to
Pierce, the job she held until she left the department in 1987, that
she exerted her control.
   Goulding said in an interview that he had gotten nowhere in
trying to persuade HUD to boost a rent subsidy for a housing
development on the south side of Providence, R.I. HUD already had
given money to fix up the project, but it needed higher rent
subsidies to make it financially workable, he said.
   Goulding wound up seeking the help of Ms. Dean.
   ``I took a shot and called her,'' he said. ``She was always very
polite to me and very nice and offering to be of help but I didn't
get anywhere, never translated into anything positive,
unfortunately.''
   Goulding wasn't alone.
   Members of Congress wrote to Pierce to push for projects back
home. Often they got letters back saying all the money had already
been spent.
   In the spring of 1985, for example, Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., wrote
a ``Dear Sam'' letter to Pierce. Although the news was bad, the tone
was friendly when he got back letter addressed ``Dear John'' and
signed just ``Sam.''
   The letter's tone was set by Ms. Dean, as was the signature. On
formal occasions she would have the machine, called an autopen, sign
``Samuel R. Pierce Jr.,'' but when the mood called for it, she would
have the letter signed ``Sam.''
   Internal file slips from HUD, carrying the initials of everyone
in the chain of command reviewing a particular piece or
correspondence, indicate that the final stop before the mail box was
at Ms. Dean's desk. It is not known whether Pierce himself saw any
of the correspondence because his initials are not on the slips.
   Pierce, whose hands-off style of management at HUD has been
sharply criticized in the wake of disclosures about political
influence, costly misjudgments and outright stealing that plagued
the department, has said he was betrayed by his aides and singled
out Ms. Dean.
   ``She liked power,'' Pierce said in an interview with The New
York Times. ``She liked the idea that, `I can call the shots, I can
get this for you if I want, I can stomp on you, I can kill you' _
that's the kind of thing she liked.''
   Among the people who beat a path to her door were former Interior
Secretary James Watt, GOP political consultant Paul Manafort, GOP
fund-raiser and now ambassador-designate to Luxembourg Fred Bush,
and Philip Winn, a former HUD official who now is ambassador to
Switzerland. All of them came away with money for the projects they
represented, bringing some of them six-figure fees from grateful
clients.
   But Ms. Dean, who held little formal authority at the department,
occasionally invoked that lack of official power to give people the
brush off.
   ``First, I feel I must explain once again,'' she wrote in 1985 to
Allen Moore, who was seeking funds for a Los Angeles project.
``Neither I nor Secretary Pierce have any authority to designate
moderate rehabilitation funds to you or your client. I have tried to
make this clear in the past.
   ``They are issued on a competitive basis, and there are far more
requests than there are units available,'' Ms. Dean wrote.
   No one would dispute that there were more requests for help than
there was help available, but few people would agree that the HUD
funds were awarded in fair competition.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of a subcommittee
investigating HUD, has called the notion of competition ``a sham and
an illusion.''
   Goulding, who said he was personally hurt for a while that his
social contacts with Ms. Dean did not translate into money, has
become forgiving over time.
   ``Unfortunately, Debbie sometimes tells you things that aren't
necessarily accurate,'' Goulding said. ``It's not because she means
badly, it's that she over commits herself.''

<TEXT>
   A fierce dispute over the future of organized
crime strike forces, the Justice Department's shock troops in the
war against the mob, is heating up within the law enforcement
community.
   ``This is a turf fight _ it's as simple as that,'' says
Philadelphia attorney Peter Vaira, a former strike force chief in
that city who once headed the President's Commission on Organized
Crime.
   A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing is set for July 21 on the
strike forces, teams of prosecutors initially established by Robert
F. Kennedy at the Justice Department to specialize in organized
crime and labor racketeering.
   Currently based in 14 cities, they have compiled a record of
achievements that even critics call impressive.
   Organized crime leaders from Boston, New York, Philadelphia,
Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City and other cities are currently
serving long prison terms as a result of strike force investigations.
   Indeed, Boston attorney Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan, a former New
England strike force chief, recalls a wiretap as early as 1981 in
which hoodlums were heard to speak hopefully of chances that the
strike forces would be disbanded.
   Actually, the strike forces will be disbanded _ in effect, if not
in name _ under a plan announced by Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh, say supporters of the units within the legal community.
   Thornburgh plans to place the strike forces, which now report
directly to Washington, under the control of presidentially
appointed U.S. attorneys, who traditionally have been the top
federal prosecutors in their communities.
   ``I think it's an unfortunate decision,'' says Temple University
law professor Charles Rogovin. ``Essentially what is being done is
the dismantling of an apparatus that has really developed a
remarkable kind of expertise.''
   Former strike force officials say there have been resignations in
Boston, Brooklyn and Los Angeles that in part were caused by
Thornburgh's plan. In fact, O'Sullivan says it was ``one factor'' in
his own departure.
   He says he had battled for years to hold the strike forces
together and, ``I just didn't have the energy to fight this fight
one more time.''
   New York attorney Edward A. McDonald, formerly chief of the
Brooklyn strike force, is critical of what officials
``euphemistically call the merger of the strike forces. I like to
call it the abolition or destruction of the strike forces.''
   Nonsense, retort Justice Department officials. They say the plan
guarantees that the strike force will remain intact but under
control of U.S. attorneys, thus ending squabbling and rivalries.
   ``Are we going to spend 30 percent of our time arguing over whose
case this is? Or are we going to make the case?'' asks Edward S.G.
Dennis, assistant attorney general and No. 2 official at the Justice
Department.
   Praise is coming from virtually all of the nation's U.S.
attorneys. ``I think this is an excellent idea,'' says Chicago U.S.
Attorney Anton R. Valukas. ``What it would do is substantially
increase our ability to continue the war on organized crime.''
   Gone are the days when U.S. attorneys lacked the sophistication
to launch the complex undercover investigations needed to catch
mobsters, says Valukas. He points to the ``Operation Graylord''
cases that revealed widespread bribery in Chicago courts and
resulted in conviction of scores of judges, lawyers and court
officials.
   U.S. Attorney James Richmond of Hammond, Ind., chairman of the
15-member Attorney General's Advisory Committee, points to stunning
successes of Rudolph Giuliani and other U.S. attorneys in New York,
where the strike force was merged into the U.S. attorney's office.
The arrangement has produced some spectacular successes against
organized crime.
   ``This will certainly not diminish the fight against organized
crime,'' says Richmond. ``It will enhance it.''
   Current strike force attorneys have remained silent in the
debate. One current strike force prosecutor, who asked not to be
identified by name, cited a March 9 memo from Dennis warning that
violations of publicity guidelines could mean firing.
   Former strike force chiefs, however, have mounted a lobbying
campaign designed to save their old program. They say Thornburgh has
carried a longstanding grudge against the program.
   ``He had innumerable run-ins with the Pittsburgh strike force
when he was U.S. attorney in the early 1970s and it left a bad taste
in his mouth,'' says Douglas Roller, former strike force chief in
Chicago.
   And questions have been raised concerning the strong political
ties that usually mark relations between U.S. attorneys and the
local establishments in their communities. Indeed, the post of U.S.
attorney has been a launching pad for many political careers.
   ``The loyalties of U.S. attorneys are to the senators who
nominated them,'' says Bruce Fein, a former Justice Department
official and now a conservative analyst of the federal court system.
   The issue came up at a June 20 hearing of the House criminal
justice subcommittee when Rep. George Sangmeister, D-Ill.,
questioned Dennis.
   ``There are always a lot of calls like, `Old Moe has been a good
contributor to the party for all these years and it's a shame that
you're doing to him what you are,''' Sangmeister said. ``I think the
U.S. attorney should be completely absolved from that.''
   Dennis suggested that in such a case the U.S. attorney might
recuse himself _ bow out to avoid a conflict _ and let an aide make
the decision.
   ``The U.S. attorney is not going to recuse himself because
somebody down in the party says take it easy on Moe,'' Sangmeister
shot back. ``You don't recuse yourself for stuff like that.''

   An Afghan government airliner crashed
in the country's southern Helmand province, killing 35 people, a
rebel-controlled news agency said Sunday.
   The Afghan News Agency, which is based in Islamabad, did not say
whether the June 26 crash involved a civilian or military aircraft.
   There was no indpendent confirmation of the crash. Afghanistan's
government-run radio did not report it.
   The guerrilla news agency said it was unclear whether the crash
was caused by mechinical failure or whether it was shot down by
rebels. The guerrillas have been fighting the country's
Soviet-backed government for more than a decade.
   The guerrilla-run news agency also reported that rebels shot down
three government helicopters during the past week.
   Two were downed near the eastern city of Jalalabad, killing 29
government soldiers being transported to bolster government troops
defending the city from rebel attacks, the news agency reported. The
third helicopter was shot down in the northwestern province of
Badghis, it said.
   The report could not be independently confirmed.

   Fatal accidents involving recreational boaters
have decreased dramatically over the past two decades, but many
weekend skippers fear increasing congestion in waters has made
pleasure trips more dangerous than ever.
   Fewer recreational boaters were killed last year than in any year
since the Coast Guard began charting such statistics in 1961,
despite a 300 percent increase in the number of pleasure crafts in
U.S. waters.
   ``Without a doubt, the waters are safer,'' said John Dane,
government relations manager at the National Marine Manufacturers
Association. ``It's a dramatic improvement.''
   The fatality rate, which peaked at 20.2 deaths per 100,000 boats
in 1971, was 5.5 per 100,000 boats last year, according to Coast
Guard documents.
   The Coast Guard said 946 recreational boaters died in 1988, the
first time the number fatalities has dipped below 1,000. The number
of boats, meanwhile, has increased from less than 6 million to an
estimated 17.3 million.
   But not everyone believes the fatality statistics are a
reflection of a safer boating environment.
   ``I dare say the waters are probably less safe than they were 20
years ago,'' said Michael Sciulla, vice president of Boat Owners
Association of the United States, which represents 310,000
recreational boat owners. ``I hear from many boat owners that they
are fearful of drunk boaters, that they are fearful of boat owners
who don't know the rules of the road, and they're fearful because of
the increasing congestion of boats on our waterways.''
   And congestion, it seems, will only get worse.
   In 1961, the Coast Guard estimated that there were 5.85 million
pleasure crafts in U.S. waters. The estimate for 1988 was 17.3
million, a threefold increase.
   ``Boating is approaching a $20 billion industry,'' Sciulla said.
``Seventy-five million Americans hop in a boat (at least) once a
year. It's become an extraordinarily popular pastime over the past
few decades.''
   The boating explosion over the past 25 years may explain another
Coast Guard statistic that stands in stark contrast to the declining
fatality rate: the rising number of reported accidents and reported
injuries.
   Reported boating injuries increased from 2,757 in 1985 to 3,476
three years later. Boating officials, however, are quick to point
out that only about 10 percent of the non-fatal marine accidents are
reported.
   ``When the figures change, it's not easy to tell if there are
more or less accidents or better reporting or other factors. It's
hard to draw conclusions,'' said Albert Marmo, assistant chief of
the Coast Guard's auxiliary, boating and consumer affairs division.
   Even if congestion is causing more accidents and injuries, most
experts agree the steadily declining fatality rate is impressive.
   The first turning point in recreational marine safety came in
1971 when Congress passed a sweeping safety law that included
mandatory federal standards for boat construction.
   In the 11 years before the law was enacted, the annual fatality
rate was 19.8 per 100,000 boats. Over the next 17 years, the average
fatality rate was less than 10 per 100,000 boats.
   After dipping dramatically in the first five years following
enactment of the federal law, from 20.2 to 9.9 per 100,000 boats,
the fatality rate leveled off through the late 1970s.
   The rate, however, continued its downward spiral during the
1980s, from 9.5 in 1980 to 5.5 last year.
   Coast Guard Capt. Bill Griswold, chief of the Coast Guard's
auxiliary, boating and consumer affairs division, attributes much of
the recent decrease to public awareness programs targeting
drunkenness at sea.

<HEAD>American Move to Bases a Further Blow to Panama's Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of American servicemen and
civilians finished moving over the weekend onto U.S. bases, widening
the rift with the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The U.S. military's Southern Command says the move is intended to
``maintain a low military profile in the face of harassment by the
Panamanian Defense Forces in recent months.''
   It also seems designed to increase pressure on Noriega to step
down as chief of the Defense Forces and Panama's de facto leader.
   It will deprive the country's already battered economy of about
$60 million a year the Americans were spending. They will now make
purchases in stores and other facilities within the Southern Command.
   A total of 6,400 Americans, including dependents, were involved
in the move, which was ordered in May by the Defense Department when
violence broke out after the May 7 presidential election.
   Government opponents and international observers said opposition
candidates won the vote by 3-1. But Noriega voided the results,
alleging interference in the campaign by the U.S. government, which
has been trying to oust him since his indictment in Miami last year
on drug trafficking charges.
   The move to military bases involved not only servicemen, but also
civilian employees of the Southern Command and its various branches.
   All had been living in houses and apartments off-base. On-base,
unmarried personnel are assigned to regular barracks, while married
people and families live in military housing. The biggest complaint
is lack of privacy.
   Civilians especially were reluctant to move. One civilian
employee of the Army, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
did ``not see the reason for it, since this was not a war zone.''
   However, there were 55 reports of harassment by Panamanian
authorities in May and six in June. They included the detention of
U.S. military personnel who were questioned by police in Panama City
for alleged petty offenses and then released.
   The mass move also disappointed some Panamanians who profited
from the American presence off-base.
   ``It is going to be hard to rent those apartments again soon,''
said a superintendent of one 34-unit apartment building. It was
leased early this year by the Southern Command for its servicemen
and employees.
   A real estate agent, who like the superintendent spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the building owners went into debt to
finance improvements _ special water tanks, air conditioning,
security _ as conditions for a contract with the U.S. military.
   ``They thought they were looking at long-term contracts,'' the
agent said.
   The Americans were paying $15 million a year in rents alone in
Panama. Their rent and the other money they spent helped keep this
country's economy barely afloat after more than a year of U.S.
economic sanctions imposed following Noriega's indictment.
   Panama was a leading international financial center with about
120 banks holding an estimated $30 billion in assets.
   A flight of capital caused by the more than yearlong political
struggle over Noriega's rule has reduced assets to about $8 billion,
according to government figures.
   Opposition leaders say unemployment last year more than doubled
to 23 percent.
   In March, Acting President Manuel Solis Palma said U.S.-imposed
sanctions, which barred payments to the government, caused a 20
percent drop in the gross national product in 1988.
   A total of 12,000 U.S. military personnel are on duty in the
Southern Command's 10 Army, Navy and Air Force installations in this
country. The troops include 2,000 sent in May by President Bush to
protect U.S. interests after the election.

<HEAD>35 Soldiers A Year Commit Suicide In The Israeli Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 35 soldiers in the Israeli army commit
suicide each year, the head of the army's personnel department said
in a newspaper interview published Sunday.
   Thirty-two soldiers committed suicide from April 1988 to April
1989, Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai told the daily Haaretz. The military
command confirmed the figures.
   Vilnai's interview was a departure from the military's customary
reluctance to provide such data, which could have a negative effect
on soldiers' morale.
   No figures on attempted suicides were given. The newspaper and
army said the average of 35 suicides was for recent years, but they
did not say which years.
   Neither Vilnai nor the military command knew if any of the
suicides were related to the 18-month-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   Vilnai said 30 percent of those who killed themselves were
reservists troubled by family and financial problems. They are
pushed into the act by the availability of weapons and the hope that
relatives will get financial compensation from the army, he said.
   Israeli men are drafted at the age of 18 for a three-year period
of regular duty, and serve up to 40 days a year as reservists until
age 55. Women are drafted for two years of regular service, and some
of them are required to serve as reservists afterward.
   The Tel Aviv-based Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies says
Israel has a 170,000-strong standing army and 370,000 reserves.
   Vilnai said an average of two to three female soldiers commit
suicide every year. He said most of the regular soldiers who have
killed themselves did so during the first year of their military
duty.
   Haaretz said the army's personnel department recently issued
instructions on how to spot troubled soldiers to prevent suicides.
   However, the paper said ``This activity is quite limited since it
is feared that dealing with the question of suicide may in fact
increase the number of suicides.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III sets out
Monday for Japan where he will meet with representatives of other
aid donor nations to discuss expanding economic assistance to the
Philippines.
   The so-called Multilateral Assistance Initiative envisions $1
billion a year from aid donors over the next five years as well as
foreign investments totaling a similar amount.
   Aside from the United States, representatives from the European
Economic Community, Canada and Australia, among others, are expected
to attend.
   The meeting is being hosted by the World Bank.
   After a one-day visit to Tokyo, Baker heads for Brunei where he
will meet with foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations
   The major topics are expected to be the evolving situation in
China and the status of international efforts to promote a peaceful
settlement to the Cambodian conflict.
   The ASEAN members are Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia,
Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei.
   Afterward, Baker heads for Poland where he will join President
Bush next Sunday at the start of his four-nation European visit.
   En route, Baker will spend a day and a half in Oman. The visit
there is described as both a rest stop and also an opportunity to
meet with officials of the government of Oman, with which the United
States has had close ties for years.

<HEAD>Latin Jazz Stars Jam At JVC Jazz Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latin jazz night has become a fixture at the
annual JVC Jazz Festival, and Saturday night's edition provided a
fine cross-section of jazz, salsa and entertaining combinations of
the two.
   The headliners were the Fania Six, all-star musicians from Puerto
Rico. They were preceded by flutist Herbie Mann, whose 35-year
career has been on the rise during the last few years since he
formed the Brazilian group Brasil Jazz.
   The evening was opened _ and nearly stolen _ by the fiery
Dominican jazz pianist Michel Camilo. The crowded bill limited
Camilo's set to about half an hour, but in that time he generated
enough energy to light a town of 10,000 for a week.
   Camilo's command of the piano is unlike anything else heard in
jazz. He is a consummate technician. Yet he keeps his technique
under the tightest control, never allowing it to outrun his musical
ideas.
   He played only his own compositions, taken from his latest album.
The tunes revealed him to be a composer of considerable depth and
inventiveness, particularly in the beautiful ballad ``Nostalgia.''
   He introduced as his special guest Paquito D'Rivera, in whose
group Camilo first came to prominence. The two have recorded
together but no longer tour together. But they haven't lost their
rapport; D'Rivera was ready to match Camilo's fireworks.
   Herbie Mann's group was a disappointment, but that may not have
been entirely his fault. The restraint and sophistication of Mann's
Brazilian-inflected group was a poor choice to follow Camilo.
Although Mann is the bigger name, he should have opened for Camilo.
   His second problem was a poorly adjusted sound system. The bass,
critical for the rhythmic sway of Brazilian music, was inaudible
through much of Mann's set.
   He repeatedly indicated to off-stage technicians that he couldn't
hear himself play, but the problem apparently was never corrected.
   His special guest was Dave Valentin, a flutist who Mann recalled
encouraging when Valentin was 16. Despite the sound problems,
Valentin's arrival on stage gave Mann's group some needed energy,
and it became clear that the group had not been at its best.
   The highlight of the evening was the last set by the Fania Six, a
group of Puerto Rican musicians (some of them based in New York)
associated with the Fania record label. They are Johnny Pacheco on
flute and vocals, Ray Barretto on congas, Papo Lucca on piano, Bobby
Valentin on bass, Robert Roena on bongos and Nicky Marrero on
timbales.
   This was classic salsa. They rhythms were irresistible, the
melodies engaging and the solos impressive. Pacheco made part of the
set into a flute extravaganza when he invited Valentin and Mann on
stage.
   The three flutists played off one another, reaching peaks they
couldn't have scaled alone. It was one of those special moments that
can occur in jazz festivals, in which artists who don't normally
perform together are suddenly thrust on stage at the same time.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people shouting ``Shame, Britain!
Shame!'' protested the arrival of British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey
Howe on Sunday and denounced his country's refusal to give refuge to
Hong Kong residents.
   ``Howe go home,'' a crowd of about 10,000 chanted as they raised
their fists in front of Government House, where Howe is staying on
his three-day fact-finding mission. ``Justice for the people of Hong
Kong!''
   About 5,000 protesters also massed at the airport and about 1,000
mostly Western residents held their own rally in support of the
protesters.
   The military crackdown on pro-democracy student protesters in
China has caused much apprehension in this British colony, which is
to revert to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Last week, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of Britain's
House of Commons rejected a proposal to allow British passport
holders in Hong Kong to emigrate to Britain. About 3.5 million of
Hong Kong's 5.7 million people hold British passports.
   Hong Kong citizens believe that Beijing cannot be trusted to live
up to its promise to keep Hong Kong's capitalist system intact for
50 years after 1997.
   In brief remarks upon his arrival, Howe did not raise the issue
of mass immigration from Hong Kong. He said he had come here to
``reaffirm British determination to secure a democratic and
prosperous future for Hong Kong.''
   ``You have no stauncher friend than Britain,'' he said.
   ``The whole world has condemned the violence and repression we've
all witnessed in China over the last few weeks,'' he added.
``Nowhere has that view been more vigorously expressed than in
Britain and in Hong Kong. You feel threatened and beleaguered by
what has happened, so that's why I'm here.''
   Howe said the British government believed that the 1984
British-Chinese agreement to return Hong Kong to China ``still
provides the right foundations'' for the future.
   At the airport, demonstration leaders gave Howe's personal
secretary a petition with about 600,000 signatures pressing for the
right to emigrate to Britain.
   The protest organizer, the Rev. Lo Lung Kwong, said demonstrators
were ``extremely dissatisfied'' that Howe did not accept the
petition himself.
   ``We feel that he does not seem to have the courage to face the
Hong Kong people personally,'' he said.
   Earlier, about 1,000 Westerners gathered in central Hong Kong to
protest Howe's visit.
   ``I've lived here for about 12 years and I consider Hong Kong
home,'' said Gasper Jones, a British businessman who came to the
rally with his two sons, both born in Hong Kong. ``London is selling
these people down the river. If they don't act and act fast, Hong
Kong as a trading center, as a financial center, is finished. All
the bright people in my company have left or are leaving.''
   Another 10,000 people marched through Hong Kong to the Government
House, carrying signs that read, ``Howe can you sleep at night?''
and ``End to British honor?''
   ``I fled the communists in Vietnam in 1975,'' said Lee Ho Fat, a
restaurateur who was marching with his family of six. ``I look at
these hooligans in Beijing and ask myself, `Am I going to have to
flee them again?' We need an assurance _ the right to live in
Britain would help.''

<HEAD>Disarmament, Trade To Be Discussed During Gorbachev Visit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to Paris this week will
include a trip to the Bastille and talks with President Francois
Mitterrand that likely will cover France's unwillingness to discuss
reducing its nuclear force.
   The trip comes one week before France celebrates the bicentennial
of the French Revolution and plays host to a summit of the seven
major Western industrialized nations. It will include a visit to
Strasbourg, where the Soviet president will address the Council of
Europe.
   Gorbachev, who arrives Tuesday, will be the first leader from the
East bloc to speak at the council. He is expected to define more
precisely the European role of a Soviet Union that has strived to
restructure its economy.
   ``A very important political declaration from the Soviet
leadership to the European public and political leaders on the
subject of a common European house will be the thrust of the
speech,'' said Andrei Grachev, deputy chief of the Communist Party's
international department, speaking to reporters at a briefing Friday.
   The ``common European home,'' an idea first expressed during
Gorbachev's visit to France in 1985, has been a vague concept in
Soviet diplomacy as the Kremlin seeks to improve relations with its
Western European neighbors. The term implies an end to the Cold War
and a change in Soviet foreign policy.
   Gorbachev is expected to use his speech to spell out the kind of
cooperation the Soviets are looking for in human rights,
environmental protection, culture and the battle against terrorism.
   In talks with Mitterrand on Tuesday and Wednesday, Gorbachev is
likely to bring up once again France's own nuclear arsenal, which
the Soviets see as an adjunct of the U.S. nuclear force.
   During his last visit, Gorbachev made sweeping arms control
proposals that later were the basis for U.S.-Soviet disarmament
negotiations. But he failed to bring Mitterrand into separate talks
on reducing France's independent nuclear force.
   The French Socialist president told Gorbachev then that it was
``not reasonable to think that there could actually be
negotiations.''
   A spokesman for the presidential palace said Friday that
Mitterrand would like to discuss chemical weapons with his Soviet
counterpart as well as regional conflicts such as Lebanon and
Cambodia.
   The French president also would like to see a reversal in the
trade deficit with the Soviet Union _ $318 million in the first
three months of this year compared to $773 million for all of 1988.
   In 1988, the main Soviet exports to France were oil and gas while
France imported primarily machinery and equipment.
   Gorbachev also plans to tour the Place de la Bastille on Tuesday,
where on July 14, 1789 workers stormed a prison fortress, unleashing
events that led to the French Revolution.
   On Wednesday, he will sign a series of Soviet-French agreements
and have meetings with Mayor Jacques Chirac, Premier Michel Rocard
and then with students and intellectuals at the Sorbonne University.
   Gorbachev will meet with Mitterrand again Thursday before leaving
for Strasbourg.
   The visit to France, which took over the rotating chairmanship of
the European Economic Community on July 1, is not expected to break
new ground in French-Soviet relations. Nor will the 58-year-old
Soviet leader find the French as effusive as the West Germans, who
thronged his stops during his visit there last month.
   Still, polls show Gorbachev to be far more popular with the
French than President Bush. The Paris Match-B.V.A. poll last week
showed Gorbachev inspired confidence in 60 percent of 1,000 French
people surveyed while only 51 percent felt the same about Bush.
   ``He is more charismatic than Bush and better known,'' said
Dominique Moisi of the French Institute for International Relations.
   ``But the French expect much less of him than the West Germans
and they are more skeptical of the Soviet Union. Besides, French
crowds simply tend to be less demonstrative than German ones.''

<HEAD>Irate Airline Passengers Scrap Flight to Protest Delays</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with background on previous similar incident involving

<TEXT>
   Passengers walked out of the
Manchester Airport early Sunday and refused to travel to Florida on
a jumbo jet delayed for two days by three separate mechanical
problems, the airport manager said.
   Roy Edwards said 167 passengers got refunds. ``They were clearly
sick to death of the whole thing,'' he said.
   It was the second such incident in four days involving North
Carolina-based Orion Air.
   The ordeal began when the Boeing 747, owned by Orion and
chartered to the British firm Air Tours, was delayed in Florida
because of an ``oil problem.''
   It finally left Orlando, Fla., but then developed an electrical
problem on its way to Manchester on Friday. When it arrived in
Manchester, a fault was found with the flap control shafts, Edwards
said.
   A spare part was flown from London's Gatwick Airport, but it was
the wrong part, Edwards said.
   The plane finally left Manchester for Florida on Sunday, 47 hours
late and with only 329 of the 496 passengers who had booked seats.
   Orion is based in Raleigh, N.C. No one answered the telephone at
the company headquarters Sunday, and the recording on the answering
machine advised callers to try again during business hours Monday
through Friday.
   In Edmonton, Alberta, 53 British tourists refused to board
another Orion Airlines Boeing 747 that was forced to land in the
Canadian city Thursday night for repairs. They demanded that the
airline make other arrangements to fly them home.
   The aircraft had been repaired four times during a trip that was
supposed to take about 480 passengers on a charter flight from
Manchester to Hawaii and back again.
   To make matters worse, a bus taking passengers from the Edmonton
Inn to the airport caught fire Friday night. No one was hurt but the
passengers had to wait for another bus to go the rest of the way.
   The plane was on the way from Hawaii back to England when it had
to land in Edmonton. Many of the passengers lost their patience. It
finally left Edmonton International Airport at about 1:30 a.m.
Saturday without the 53 people who had refused to board.

<HEAD>Soviet Newspaper Says Khrushchev Denounced Colleagues in Purges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was quick
to denounce his colleagues as disloyal during the Stalinist purges
of the 1930s, a Soviet newspaper reported Sunday.
   ``We need to destroy those scoundrels,'' Sovietskaya Rossia
quoted Khrushchev as saying at the 1937 conference of the Moscow
Communist Party organization. ``While destroying one, two or 10, we
are doing the deed on behalf of millions.
   ``We should step over the dead bodies of our enemies for the sake
of the people.''
   The article was based on previously closed archives and written
by historian A. Ponomarev, assistant director of the history
institute of the Moscow Communist Party.
   Khrushchev, who rose to lead the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964,
published his memoirs in the West but glossed over his role in the
purges of his predecessor, Josef Stalin, who killed millions of
Soviets in consolidating his control. Excerpts from Khrushchev's
autobiography were published in the Soviet Union this year.
   The newspaper report indicated that Khrushchev rose by joining in
Stalin's accusations of disloyalty.
   ``He was part of a new group whose members were more loyal to
Stalin _ who entered the leadership due to their active fight
against rightists,'' wrote Ponomarev.
   When Khrushchev moved up to Ukrainian party leader, he had words
of praise for his successor, A.I. Igarov, the article said. But
within months, Igarov was being blamed for mistakes, and Khrushchev
joined the chorus, according to the report.
   ``This time Khrushchev spoke of him as an old enemy, hired by
Trotskyites and rightists who had been involved in hostile actions
in Leningrad and Moscow,'' Ponomarev wrote.
   Lev Trotsky was a Bolshevik rival who was denounced by Stalin,
forced into exile and eventually assassinated in Mexico. Thousands
of Soviets were put to death on charges of conspiring with Trotsky
against the Soviet leadership.
   In the early years of Stalin's attacks on his colleagues,
Khrushchev was party chief of a workers' school called
Promakademiya. The article said that as soon as Khrushchev took the
post in 1930, 40 Communists were hauled before the party leadership
to answer questions on their loyalty.
   The newspaper also said Khrushchev was one of the first to accuse
Nikolas Bukharin, a member of the ruling Politburo in the 1920s who
was ousted by Stalin in 1929. In fact, Khrushchev had to retract his
early criticism after the party newspaper Pravda published a letter
praising Bukharin, the article said.
   Later, the tide turned against Bukharin and he was executed in
1938.

   The United Church of Christ, a
progressive denomination with roots in the earliest American
colonies, is struggling to end a 10-year battle over whether its
national offices should leave New York City.
   The 703 delegates of the denomination's 17th General Synod hoped
to decide Monday whether to combine its national offices _ now
scattered in three New York City locations _ in a single New York
location or move them to Cleveland.
   Synod delegates will also elect a new president on Monday. One of
the candidates is a woman who if elected would become the first
woman president of a major Protestant group in the United States.
   Leaders of the 32-year-old, 1.8 million-member denomination
expected the synod to handily approve a study committee's
recommendation to move the headquarters denomination to Cleveland.
Presbyterian and Lutheran denominations involved in mergers also
have moved from the city in recent years.
   But, after four days of meetings, the synod has become sharply
divided over whether the cost savings available in Cleveland are
worth losing some ecumenical ties in New York.
   Those favoring New York wear apple stickers on their name tags.
Delegates favoring Cleveland wear a sailboat.
   ``Most people feel that there are some compelling arguments on
either side,'' said the Rev. Reiss Potterveld, senior minister at
Congregational Church of Northridge, Calif., near Los Angeles.
   Potterveld chairs the 33-member committee that for nearly seven
hours on Saturday reviewed the earlier committee's study of the
issue. His committee set up Monday's decision by endorsing the
Cleveland proposal 21-10 with two abstentions.
   The UCC's last national meeting, in 1987, rejected a
recommendation to move the headquarters to St. Louis, ordering the
formation of a study committee instead.
   ``People are sick of this,'' the UCC's Evan Golder said, adding
that another deferral is unlikely. The headquarters debate has raged
for 10 years, he said, since the denomination was forced by a
landlord's decision and the New York rental market to split its
offices.
   No poll of the full delegation had been taken on the issue. But a
proposal already on the synod floor would scrap the committees'
recommendation and move two of the New York UCC offices to the third
office at the Interchurch Center, which houses 65 church and other
non-profit organizations.
   The Ohio delegation, more than 70 people, is the synod's largest,
and its leaders have lobbied hard for a move to Cleveland,
particularly among large delegations from nearby states.
   Critics say a move from New York would diminish the UCC's
standing in the ecumenical community.
   ``This church has a historic and strong involvement in the
ecumenical movement,'' Potterveld said. ``This move will put certain
hardships on that. Both committees recognize that. It (ecumenism) is
part of our heritage and will continue to be part of our future.''
   But not all agree the UCC's ecumenical efforts are best served in
New York, and supporters of the move to Cleveland say it would save
millions in rent and other costs and bridge a symbolic gap between
the national and local church.
   The nominees for president of the denomination are the Rev. Paul
H. Sherry of Chicago and the Rev. Yvonne Delk of Union City, N.J. If
Delk wins, she would be the first woman president of the United
Church of Christ or other major Protestant denomination.
   The president of the UCC is the denomination's senior minister,
chief executive and its official representative in ecumenical
relations. While the president has no doctrinal or authoritarian
power over the denomination's members, the position is widely viewed
as an important theological platform.
   The denomination formed in the 1957 merger of the Congregational
Christian Churches and the Evangelical and Reformed Church. It is
unrelated to the Church of Christ, a loosely associated group of
conservative churches.

<HEAD>New Rules Aimed at Protecting New York Patients</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York over the weekend became the first state
to limit the grueling work hours of interns and residents to reduce
the risk of error by dazed and exhausted doctors-in-training.
   New York, which trains 16 percent of the nation's doctors, is
leading a national movement away from the century-old tradition of
36-hour shifts and 100-hour work weeks for postgraduate trainees in
medicine. The Health Department now limits shifts to 24 hours and
the work week to 80 hours.
   Several hospitals in the city had already implemented the 24-hour
rules, and a medical council is preparing guidelines that will be
enforceable nationwide.
   Long hours have been ``a rite of passage for years and years,''
said Dr. Joseph Sachter, chief emergency room resident at
Metropolitan Hospital in New York City. ``But there's been an
astonishing change in two years.''
   Proponents of the tradition say shunning sleep toughens young
doctors to the rigors of medicine and lets them study the
progression of a patient's illness. Critics say bleary-eyed
residents endanger patients _ and can even kill them.
   ``You come in pretty blind in July and August _ it's no secret
the mortality rates are the highest when the interns are brand new.
You don't know what's going on even with an enormous amount of
direction,'' said a 33-year-old New York City intern who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   State Health Commissioner Dr. David Axelrod said today's doctors
must learn more than their predecessors, make more decisions and
treat sicker patients.
   ``Is it ideal if a resident works 24 hours? No _ but it's a lot
better than 36 hours at a time,'' said Sachter.
   The Hospital Association of New York State and Blue Cross, backed
by the state medical society, have sued to block the regulations,
charging they will be too costly. The hospital industry estimates
4,500 to 5,000 workers must be hired statewide to implement the plan.
   A Health Department study of hospitals with high mortality rates
raised serious questions about the quality of supervision and the
dangers posed by resident fatigue. Axelrod appointed a panel to
address the issue after the 1984 death of the daughter of
author-lawyer Sidney Zion.
   Libby Zion, 18, died after going to New York Hospital for
treatment of an earache and fever. A grand jury, while indicting no
one, found Ms. Zion's death resulted from inadequate care and errors
by unsupervised interns and residents.
   ``We have a sense that there are problems related to fatigue. But
it's harder to attribute a poor decision to fatigue and much easier
to determine that supervision was not present,'' said Health
Department spokeswoman Faith Schottenfeld.
   In February, Drs. Dennis H. Novack and David B. Reuben of Rhode
Island Hospital described fatigue-induced mistakes in a letter to
the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   They told of a get-together where residents admitted ``giving the
wrong antibiotic, overlooking diagnoses, mistranscribing orders and
falling asleep while writing up a history.''
   But traditions die hard.
   When Axelrod and Dr. Bertrand Bell, professor at Albert Einstein
College of Medicine, started pressing for reform in 1987, they were
``lambasted and torn apart by the New York medical establishment,''
said Sachter.
   ``Older physicians say: `I did it _ they're going to do it. ... I
think we're coddling these kids,''' Axelrod said in a May speech.
``Our elders don't recognize that medicine has changed.''
   The Chicago-based Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
Education, the accreditation body for all teaching hospitals in the
United States, is about to issue work limits for some specialties
and strengthen supervision for all of them.
   The guidelines will be phased in as each hospital comes up for
accreditation over the next three or four years, said James
Weinlader, director of residence review committee activities.
   Critics say hospitals rely on residents for cheap labor. They
earn about $30,000 a year, which comes to $6.25 an hour for a
100-hour week. Costs are a big concern to the New York hospital
association, which says two-thirds of the 220 non-profit or public
hospitals it represents lost money in 1988.
   The Health Department has granted hospitals $226 million in
reimbursements for more staff to take over some jobs previously done
by interns and residents. The hospital association says its members
need $149 million more.
   As for enforcement of the regulations, the Health Department will
be satisfied for now with a good-faith effort, said Schottenfeld.

   Sometime Monday night or early Tuesday, Robert
Merry will retrieve ``Old Nancy'' from her secret hiding place and
take her to the town common in Rowley, about 30 miles north of
Boston.
   There the 1,200-pound, Revolutionary War-era cannon will be fired
just twice on Independence Day before ging back in hiding for
another year _ a precaution Merry says is necessary to keep the
militiamen in neighboring Georgetown from stealing her.
   ``We only move her under cover of darkness,'' said Merry, 45, who
holds the honorary post of town cannoneer. ``We have to be very
careful because of the neighbors. They send spies out once in a
while.''
   Horsefeathers, replied Alan Aulson, a member of Georgetown's
Board of Selectmen.
   ``We already have the real Nancy,'' said Aulson, 41. ``If you go
down to the Georgetown Town Hall, you'll see her right there _
mounted on a block so the guys from Rowley can't take her.''
   As for Rowley's fat old muzzleloader, Aulson said: ``They put a
few firecrackers in it and they make a nice bang, but that doesn't
make it real.''
   The annual cannon fusillade between Rowley and Georgetown, in
which sarcasm and subterfuge long ago replaced black powder and
shot, has been a Fourth of July tradition for more than 100 years.
   It all started in 1775, when a colonial raider, Capt. John
Manley, captured the British frigate Nancy off the Massachusetts
coast and Rowley's militiamen were assigned to guard the ship's
cannon.
   In 1839, the town of New Rowley, now Georgetown, seceded from
Rowley and ownership of the cannon came in dispute.
   According to one local legend, the Rowley militia hid it in the
Rowley River, which kept it out of the hands of the upstarts from
New Rowley but somehow ruined its ability to shoot.
   Another legend has it that a clever Georgetown carpenter
fashioned a fake cannon out of wood in 1877, after ``Old Nancy'' had
been stolen back and forth several times.
   Merry says the Georgetown militia probably had some kind of
devilment in mind, such as switching the cannons and making off with
the real one, but the plot was foiled when an observant Rowley
resident noticed that Georgetown's horsedrawn artillery carriage
wasn't sinking very deep in the mud.
   ``He just walked over and stuck his jacknife in the barrel of the
cannon, and that was the end of that,'' Merry said.
   Today, both Rowley and Georgetown have iron cannon. Georgetown
claims its cannon can't be fired because it's the original _ the one
that came out of the Rowley River.
   Merry replies that having a non-firing cannon ``is the price you
pay for cheap imitations acquired at some Topsfield yard sale.''
   Both towns are celebrating important anniversaries this year.
Rowley, which has 3,900 inhabitants, is turning 350. Georgetown,
with 5,700 residents, turns 150.
   Neither side expects the dispute over Old Nancy to be resolved
anytime soon.
   ``I sure hope not,'' said Merry. ``If it did, it would just be an
old cannon.''

<HEAD>NEA President Gives Emotional Speech At Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mary Hatwood Futrell urged America's teachers
to ``embrace change'' and remember her as having ``chalk dust on the
sleeves of her soul'' in an emotional farewell speech Sunday to the
National Education Association.
   Futrell, president of the 2-million-member union for the past six
years, steps down at the end of the summer. A vote on her successor
was scheduled Monday at the annual NEA Representative Assembly
attended by some 8,400 delegates.
   Futrell is widely credited with bringing the NEA into the thick
of education reform and helping it shed an obstructionist image
fueled by attacks by President Reagan and other conservatives in the
past decade.
   In a 17-page speech interrupted more than 60 times by applause,
cheers and standing ovations, Futrell exhorted her members not only
to participate in but to lead the education reform movement.
   ``We need massive, systemwide restructuring, and the plan we
follow must be a plan conceived, written and implemented by the
educators of America,'' she said. ``We have the programs. We have
the organizational expertise to use our collective bargaining power
to impact areas that go far beyond the issue of salary, as critical
as that issue is and always will be.''
   Futrell said NEA must continue to say no to ``the voucher
salesmen, to the tuition tax credit peddlers, to the elitists, the
politically ambitious and the educationally inexperienced _ all
those who think they know our business better than we do.''
   But she also urged the organization, once labeled ``the status
quo incarnate'' by former Education Secretary William Bennett, not
to stand in the path of worthwhile reforms.
   ``We must embrace change and reject reaction,'' she said. ``We
must continue to expand politically and professionally as we have
over the last 20 years, especially the last five years. ... We must
push hard, we must take risks, we must never let up.''
   Futrell, an Alexandria, Va., resident who has not ruled out an
eventual run for Congress, took some parting shots at Reagan and
also at President Bush.
   Bush declined both a pre-election candidate interview with the
group and an invitation to speak this weekend at its meeting. About
one-third of the union consists of registered Republicans, according
to Futrell.
   ``We've had enough of leaders who whittle away at our schools
then complain that the foundation of education is crumbling,''
Futrell said. ``We've had enough of leaders who think education
policy is having their picture taken in a first grade class, just in
time for the nightly news.''
   The departing union chief reiterated NEA calls for full funding
of national education, health and nutrition programs for
disadvantaged children and dismissed conservative criticism of the
group as having a ``cash register mentality.''
   ``The bankers don't apologize for saying they need more
(money),'' she said, referring to the savings and loan crisis. ``The
generals don't apologize. And we're not going to apologize either.''
   Futrell touched on gun control, homelessness, the global economy,
negative campaigning and other broad issues in the course of her
speech, but ended on a personal note that brought her a lengthy
standing ovation.
   ``I am still Mary the teacher who 20 years ago sat where you are
sitting, and I am still a teacher and I always shall be,'' she said.
``So my dear friends, if you remember me, I want you to remember me
as Mary Hatwood Futrell, someone who has chalk dust on the sleeves
of her soul.''
   The two men vying to succeed Futrell are Vice President Keith
Geiger of Michigan and executive committee member John Wilson of
North Carolina. Geiger is generally considered more moderate and
more likely to continue on the course set by Futrell.

<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 relatives of
people killed when a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian airliner a
year ago have sued the makers of the ship's radar system, a
spokesman said Sunday.
   Nagib Ghafoor said the suit was filed June 28 in U.S. District
Court in San Francisco on behalf of relatives of 83 of the 290
victims.
   The announcement of the lawsuit came on the eve of the July 3
anniversary of the 1988 tragedy, when an Iran Air Airbus was shot
down by the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf.
   Vincennes crew members said they mistook the airliner for an
Iranian F-14 fighter coming in to attack.
   The jetliner was on a commercial flight from the Iranian city of
Bandar Abbas, where a large air base is located, to Dubai in the
southern United Arab Emirates.
   Ghafoor said the lawsuit was filed against the General Electric
Corp. ``and other entities which designed and manufactured the radar
equipment on board the USS Vincennes.''
   GE is based in Fairfield, Conn. ``The company has not seen the
suit yet, so it's inappropriate to comment,'' said Jack Batty, a
company spokesman.
   Most of the passengers aboard the ill-fated Airbus were Iranians.
   Pentagon analysts have said split-second decisions aboard the
Vincennes were affected by the inability of radar operators to
immediately match the plane's radar trace with digital direction,
altitude and speed information displayed on another screen.
   Ghafoor said the complaint charged that the radar equipment
indicated the aircraft approaching the Vincennes was an F-14, diving
in an attack mode at an altitude of 4,000 feet, rather than the Iran
Air flight, which was climbing.
   He said claims against the United States on behalf of the
families ``are in the process of being filed as well.''
   The Iranian government has been seeking a World Court verdict
against the United States and demanded financial compensation for
the 290 dead.
   He did not mention any figure for the compensation sought but
said the group would be guided by the amount of compensation the
Iraqi government paid the families of American sailors killed in an
Iraqi air strike on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf on
May 16, 1987.
   The Iraqis said the ship was hit because the pilot of a Mirage
fighter-bomber mistook it for an Iranian warship.
   Iraq has agreed to pay $27.3 million to the families of 37 U.S.
crewmen killed aboard the Stark, meaning each family would receive
around $740,000.
   The United States had asked for $29.6 million for the families,
along with an unspecified amount for 21 sailors wounded in the
incident.

   Actor William Hurt, currently in a bitter court
fight with ex-lover Sandra Jennings, has kept her ``twisting in the
wind'' for money and treats her ``almost like she's the baby
sitter,'' his brother says.
   Jim Hurt, speaking in the July 10 issue of People magazine, said
Hurt and Jennings were ``foolish in the way they went about having a
child.'' The couple has a 6-year-old son, Alex.
   ``And that led to disaster. I see it as a tragedy,'' said the
actor's younger brother.
   ``In the long run, yes, he took care of them financially,'' Jim
Hurt said. ``But he always kept Sandra guessing as to when the
payment would come in. This attitude of keeping her twisting in the
wind ... is what did most of the damage. Sandra was never a
gold-digger.''
   Jennings is suing Hurt in Manhattan, charging she was his
common-law wife and entitled to half his earnings since 1982. The
couple, who split in 1983, were never married but lived together for
several years, including a few weeks in South Carolina, which
recognizes common-law marriages.
   The enmity between the pair may be the result of old wounds from
those days, Jim Hurt said.
   ``If Sandra's relationship with Bill had been healthier, if he'd
shown her more courtesy over the years, then there wouldn't be such
bitterness now. He treats her almost like she's the baby sitter,''
he said.

   Dick Cavett, back in Nebraska for his 35th
high school reunion, said he once had doubts about his career and
thought he was crazy to leave the Cornhusker State.
   Cavett, the entertainer and talk show host who was raised in
Gibbon, Grand Island and Lincoln, said Friday that he loves to
return to Nebraska whenever he gets a chance. And he said he
sometimes wonders how his life would have turned out if he stayed in
his home state.
   He recalled returning to the state once during a period of
``extreme self-doubts and anguish about what I had done with my
life.''
   At the time, he said, he said to himself: ``Why did I ever leave
here? I was insane. This is what people work for, to get to live in
a place like Lincoln.''
   However, Cavett still spends most of his time in Manhattan.
   ``As wretched as New York has gotten in so many ways,'' Cavett
said, ``I still get a thrill every time I cross one of the bridges
and see the skyline. I think, `God, I love being in the midst of all
this.'
   ``But then on the other hand, being in the midst of it, I don't
take advantage of it,'' he said. ``I come out to Lincoln and people
show me their playbills from Broadway shows and say, `Did you think
this was better than that?' and I say, `I didn't see either one of
them.'''

   Former President Ronald Reagan and
wife Nancy landed here on their way to an unannounced, unofficial
buffalo hunt at a Mexican ranch and game preserve, a newspaper
reported.
   The Sierra Vista Herald said a Reagan spokesman in Los Angeles
would only say that the former first couple was on a private trip.
   The Redo ranch in Mexico was visited twice by Reagan while he was
president, according to Mexican journalist Alma Lorenia, a reporter
in Hermosillo, a Mexican town about 15 miles south of the Arizona
border. Both times, she said, Reagan was officially said to be in
Santa Barbara, Calif.
   Reagan was met at the Sierra Vista Airport on Saturday by U.S.
Secret Service agents, who closed the airport terminal, and was last
observed climbing into a four-wheel-drive vehicle in nearby Bisbee.
   A motorcade of Secret Service vehicles and the Reagan party was
escorted by Cochise County Sheriff Jimmy Judd and several deputies.
   ``I just don't want some crackpot taking a shot at him while he's
in Cochise County,'' Judd said.
   Reagan frequently has visited a Cochise County ranch owned by a
relative of actor Jimmy Stewart, the newspaper reported.

   An unprecedented statewide crackdown
by 1,000 officers ended early Sunday with nearly 2,200 people
arrested on charges of using or dealing crack. Many suspects were
back on the street within hours.
   Operation Rock Pile also seized more than 3,000 ``rocks'' of the
purified form of cocaine, generally sold in pea-sized amounts that
are smoked in a pipe.
   Many suspects were arrested by officers posing as dealers. Others
were captured in raids and dramatic foot chases.
   ``It's gone way above our expectations,'' said Broward County
Sheriff Nick Navarro, coordinator of the sweep.
   At some points Saturday night, authorities took in suspects at a
rate of 100 an hour, with more than a third of the arrests in urban
southern Florida. More than 400 arrests took place in the mostly
rural western Panhandle.
   ``It shows that crack is not just an urban problem,'' said
Broward sheriff's spokesman Al Gordon. ``We arrested people ranging
from inner cities to the country, from kids to very mature adults.''
   Among those arrested was Bessie Hardin, 59, and her son, O.T.
Nelson, both of Kissimmee. ``She had 11 grams of cocaine in her
underwear,'' said Osceola County Sheriff's Lt. Rick Drew. ``Her son
had 3 grams on him.''
   The 48-hour effort, described as the largest single anti-drug
campaign in the nation, targeted street-level users and dealers, the
people who keep the big distributors in business, said George
Crolius, a Broward sheriff's spokesman.
   Many of the suspects were charged with cocaine possession or
sale, and then used bail bondsmen to post $5,000 to $10,000 bail.
   ``I'm just walking one out right after another,'' said an
Orlando-area bondsman who spoke on condition he not be identified.
``For me, (the drug bust) is great.''
   In Orlando's poor Winwood community, some doubted whether the
marathon drug bust would make a difference.
   ``No way,'' said one dealer, clutching a plastic bag of crack.
``No way is it going to help.''
   ``One night won't do it. (But) if they keep doing what they've
been doing, it will help a lot,'' said Althea Shaw, a 33-year-old
resident.
   The tactics used in the sweep _ particularly undercover stings _
raised concern with the Florida chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   ``Anytime you have reverse stings, with police used as a lure for
drug users, you're entering a very sensitive area,'' said ACLU
counsel Charleen Carres. ``The ACLU is in favor of battling drugs,
but we don't feel people's rights should be violated in the rush to
stop drug traffic.''
   Three undercover patrolmen suffered minor injuries in Broward
County after their car was rammed by a vehicle driven by a suspect.
   In addition to crack, authorities found more than 10 pounds of
cocaine and three pounds of other drugs, including heroin and
steroids. More than $44,300 was confiscated and about 300 cars, a
boat and nearly 50 firearms were seized, said Crolius.
   Gordon said Florida sheriffs plan more such sweeps.
   ``Look how much we took in,'' he said. ``It shows these type of
operations work.''

<HEAD>Frederick Bush Ambassadorial Nomination In `Deep Trouble'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's nomination of his chief
political fundraiser to be U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg is in
``deep trouble'' because of his involvement in the Housing and Urban
Development scandal, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Sunday.
   ``I would guess it may be a while before he goes to Luxembourg,''
Dole said of Frederick M. Bush, who is no relation to the president
but was the finance director for both his 1980 and 1988 presidential
campaigns.
   ``And if he goes, it may just be as a visitor,'' Dole quipped.
   Frederick Bush was questioned extensively last Thursday and in
May by the House Government Operations Committee about hundreds of
thousands of dollars in consultant fees which his lobbying firm,
Bush &amp; Co., reaped in 1986 and 1987 for HUD projects in Puerto Rico.
   In the testimony, Frederick Bush acknowledged he had contacted
political appointees at HUD but said he did not feel that he had
``political influence'' with them because of his campaign efforts on
behalf of George Bush or his job as deputy director of the vice
president's staff from 1982 to 1984.
   ``I made the distinction between what I call political access and
political influence,'' the 40-year-old ambassador-designate told the
House panel.
   Dole, interviewed on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' program, said he
was not urging the president to withdraw Frederick Bush's nomination.
   ``I'll support the president,'' Dole said, adding, ``but I think
you've got to be realistic in this business. I don't believe ... the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee (is) going to be in any hurry to
confirm his nomination or to report his nomination favorably.''

   A man was in fair condition Sunday after
his pet python wrapped its 15-foot body around him and started
squeezing, cutting off the man's oxygen and blood flow.
   Tom Ortiz of Kansas City lost consciousness Saturday after Tina,
his 50-pound-plus snake, started to constrict him, officials said.
   ``Our treatment at the scene was for a severe constricting
injury,'' said Jerry Overton of Metropolitan Ambulance Services
Trust. ``When we arrived, the patient was in critical condition.''
   Ortiz, 24, was in fair condition Sunday afternoon at St. Luke's
Hospital, where a spokesman said Ortiz had not suffered internal
injuries but was under observation.
   Tina was taken into custody by Kansas City Animal Control
officials, who said they were uncertain what would become of the
snake.
   They didn't know whether Tina meant to harm Ortiz or just give
him a hug. Pythons are non-poisonous and crush their prey to eat.

   Four Greenpeace activists jumped into
the Baltic Sea on Sunday to block the way of the U.S. cruiser
Ticonderoga, which the environmental organization said might be
carrying nuclear weapons.
   The warship steamed past the activists and sailed into the
Stockholm harbor.
   ``The cruiser signaled with its horns, and police in small boats
tried to pick our people up from the water, but didn't succeed,''
Greenpeace spokesman Magnus Furugard said.
   Two hours earlier, police boarded and confiscated the Greenpeace
vessel Moby Dick and arrested the eight activists on board on
charges of planning a sabotage action, Furugard said.
   ``We did not plan anything criminal. We carried out a
demonstration,'' Furugard said. ``It's a crime to bring in nuclear
weapons, and a crime to spread nuclear weapons.''
   The Swedish government forbids foreign ships to bring nuclear
weapons into its waters, but it assumes that the prohibition will be
respected and does not question visitors.
   The U.S. Navy refuses to confirm or deny whether a particular
ship carries nuclear weapons.
   Greenpeace announced Friday it was planning a peaceful action to
protest the visit of the cruiser, which the organization said
normally carried nuclear weapons.
   ``The government has failed in its duty to stop the spread of
nuclear weapons in the world,'' Furugard said.
   The U.S. ship was scheduled to stay in Stockholm two days.

   Rick ``Pellet Gun'' Krause lived up to
his nickname, powering a cherry pit nearly 20 yards to defend his
title in an annual contest here.
   Krause, a teacher from Sparta, puckered up and propelled his pit
59 feet, 6 inches Saturday to win the 16th Annual Cherry Pit
Spitting Championship held at the Tree-Mendus Fruit Farm in
southwestern Michigan.
   The effort fell far short of Krause's record 72-foot, 7-inch spit
in last year's competition. Krause blamed a stiff breeze that forced
him to spit into the wind.
   ``If the wind had been the other way, I think it would have been
a record,'' Krause said, adding that he managed six 80-foot spits
while practicing before Saturday's event. ``The pit kind of dies on
you.''

   It's the Old South in wood and white
paint, and it's available for $9 million.
   Nottoway plantation's 64 rooms, 200 windows and 22 white cypress
columns are for sale. ``A rare opportunity to purchase a part of
American History,'' an advertisement says.
   The three-story landmark near the Mississippi was completed in
1859. Owner Paul Ramsay, an Australian health care mogul, has asked
a Dallas realty company to offer the home for sale. He and a partner
bought it in 1985 for $4.5 million.
   John Lewis of Hoffman Realty said an advertisement for Nottoway
first appeared in The New York Times a week ago. By the end of the
week, he said, six people, all from the New York area, have inquired
about buying Nottoway.
   Lewis described the inquiries as ``very serious'' and said all
six indicated they would continue the plantation's tours, restaurant
and bed and breakfast operations.
   Nottoway first opened its doors to the public in 1980. After
several unprofitable years, Lewis said, the property now is making
money.
   Nottoway was built by John Hampden Randolph, a wealthy sugar cane
planter from a prominent Virginia family. It's famous for its white
ballroom, its white marble mantles, original crystal chandelier and
intricate plaster friezework and medallions.
   It was shelled by a Yankee gunboat during the Civil War, and tour
guides say some bullet holes still can be found in the building's
cypress facade.

Phil Gavasto there was only one place to hold the wedding: on
Grizella Street.
   As about 125 friends and neighbors looked on Friday night, the
father of the bride, John A. Stark, escorted Ms. Stark down a
neighbor's driveway into the cul-de-sac, where she stood next to the
groom.
   The lawn was decorated with nine pink flamingos, one dressed as a
bride and another as a groom. The cul-de-sac was decorated with
balloons and a piano stood off to the side of the street.
   Gavasto said he enjoyed the street wedding.
   ``The people here are like an extended family,'' he said. ``The
whole block are exceptional people.''
   The bride and groom plan to live _ where else ? _ on Grizella

<TEXT>
   Conservative Tzannis Tzannetakis was sworn
in Sunday as premier of a conservative-leftist coalition government
formed to end corrupt politics as crowds chanted ``Put the crooks in
jail!''
   The conservative New Democracy Party and the Coalition of the
Left and Progress agreed to the government Saturday on condition it
last only three months and limit its work to ``restoring democratic
institutions and cleansing Greek political life.''
   About 3,000 people gathered outside the Presidential Palace
downtown to applaud the 22 members of the new government as they
entered and departed after being sworn in by Orthodox Archbishop
Serapheim of Athens.
   ``Catharsis, catharsis, put the crooks in jail!'' the crowd
chanted when Tzannetakis appeared.
   Tzannetakis later presided over the government's first Cabinet
meeting. He said financial scandals involving the outgoing socialist
government would be investigated and that justice would be carried
out ``in full and in depth.''
   Parliament convenes Monday, and under the constitution
Tzannetakis has 15 days to present his government's program for
approval.
   Greece's political parties were forced into negotiations to form
a coalition government after none won a majority in the 300-seat
unicameral parliament in elections June 18.
   New Democracy won 145 seats, six short of an absolute majority;
the Coalition of the Left and Progess won 28 seats and outgoing
Premier Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or
PASOK, won 125. A small conservative party and an independent took
the other two seats.
   It was the first time communists have played a role in
determining the formation of Greece's government.
   Investigating a multimillion-dollar scandal allegedly involving
ministers in Papandreou's government will be the focus of the new
government's work.
   That scandal, and the 70-year-old Papandreou's open affair with a
woman half his age while he was married, contributed to his
downfall. He has been hospitalized with a heart and kidney condition.

   The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual and
political leader, arrives Monday to conduct a three-day teaching
ceremony as part of a Western tour promoting peace and human rights.
   The Tibetan Buddhist leader, who fled Chinese soldiers in his
homeland three decades ago, is using the international outcry over
the bloody crackdown on student demonstrators in Beijing to refocus
attention on repressive Chinese rule in Tibet.
   Tibetan exiles say 800 people have been killed in their homeland
since the Chinese imposed martial law and moved against independence
demonstrators March 5. Official reports of deaths have been much
smaller.
   The protests began a few days before the 30th anniversary of a
failed uprising in Tibet. The Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal
ruler of the Tibetans since he was 15, fled to India on March 31,
1959, three weeks after the uprising began when Chinese troops
launched a bloody attack.
   He set up his headquarters and a government-in-exile in the
northern Indian city of Dharmsala.
   The 55-year-old Dalai Lama was scheduled to arrive Monday night
after holding interfaith services in Costa Rica and Mexico and
taking part in a peace conference with Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias Sanchez, the Nobel laureate and architect of a peace plan for
Central America. He leaves July 20 for New York to accept a human
rights award.
   He will conduct an intricate ceremony known as the Kalachakra
initiation, or Wheel of Time, for at least 3,000 Buddhists in Santa
Monica. Also scheduled for his visit to Southern California _ home
to 200,000 of the United States' estimated 2.5 million Buddhists _
is a speech on peace open to the general public.
   The lama, known for his wide knowledge of the world's religions
and politics, will meet the news media Friday, give a public speech
Sunday at the Shrine Auditorium downtown and hold teaching sessions
July 10 through July 13 at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.
   The auditorium also will be the site of the sacred Wheel of Time
ceremony, conducted only a few times in the West. A lama dance will
be performed July 15. The ceremony itself will run for several hours
a day July 16 through July 18, and a ``long life'' initiation will
take place July 19. The Dalai Lama will be aided by 18 monks.
   Some 3,000 of the auditorium's 4,000 seats had been reserved by
Friday, at a registration fee of $150, said trip spokeswoman Betty
Rogers.
   The ceremony, intended to help believers along the path to
enlightenment, centers on creation of a mandala, a painting crafted
from colored sand, representing Kalachakra, a four-faced god with 24
arms who subdues violence. Laid out in concentric circles, the
painting includes Sanskrit characters, flowers, animals and 722
symbols for Buddhist deities in a many-chambered palace.
   A separate group of monks will create a duplicate mandala at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History from July 6 through
Aug. 17.
   China says it has ruled Tibet for more than seven centuries. Many
Tibetans say they actually were independent for much of that time,
ruled by a Buddhist theocracy headed by the Dalai Lama.

   A student involved in China's crushed democracy
movement looked out over Tiananmen Square on Sunday and mourned what
he said was the death of his generation's campaign for a freer
society.
   ``It was as if I could see all the people, all the tents again
before my own eyes,'' he said with a wistful smile, four weeks to
the day after soldiers and tanks wrested the square from
pro-democracy student activists.
   ``It used to be so lively, brimming with energy, people marching
here, listening to speeches there, singing over there,'' he said
after gazing over the immaculate _ and empty _ square from the
rostrum of Tiananmen Gate, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace. ``It feels
as though I've died and come back again.''
   It was four Sundays ago that the People's Liberation Army blasted
through hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians and flattened the
tent city that had sprung up on Tiananmen, the heart of the movement
for democratic reforms.
   Martial law authorities opened the Gate and two parks adjacent to
it to tourists Saturday to mark the 68th anniversary of the founding
of the Chinese Communist Party.
   Only a few dozen soldiers with automatic rifles ringed the
100-acre square Sunday afternoon. The square was scrubbed clean of
all traces of the hundreds of thousands who crossed it during the
popular uprising.
   The student, one of three representatives from his school who
took part in meetings of the banned Beijing Autonomous Student
Union, studies social sciences at a well-known college in the
Chinese capital. He did not want his name used.
   He spent many nights in a sleeping bag and then a makeshift tent
on Tiananmen after students began their occupation of it May 13.
   Now he says he and fellow students are still reeling from the
violence of June 3-4. The government says up to 300 died, but
Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say up to 3,000
lost their lives.
   ``My classmates who took part in the movement _ writing posters,
marching at school, chanting slogans _ were completely stunned by
the outcome,'' he said.
   Some, he said, are quietly accepting the government line that
troops were needed to quell the ``counterrevolutionary turmoil,''
because they want to join the Communist Party to further their
careers.
   ``If a man and woman are equally qualified for a job, work units
will want the man, but if the woman is a party member, they'll want
her,'' he said. ``It means the person was good in school, is in good
health, has the right thoughts and is likely to move ahead in the
world.''
   The student said he had been planning to apply for party
membership this year but scrapped the idea after the crackdown.
   ``I can criticize the student movement, given that the results
were hardly what we wanted. But I can't bring myself to trample
people underfoot. That's what you have to do to be a party member
these days,'' he said.
   During the protests, which began in mid-April, ``I thought it was
something we must do,'' he said. ``But the result was something that
should never ever have happened. I haven't been able to reconcile
this with myself yet.
   ``We didn't think enough. We were very optimistic. We were making
noise, being heard, we thought we were adding a little democracy to
our system. Now, people have died.''
   He thinks the crackdown has beaten student voices into silence,
at least for a few years.
   ``The warm spirit of the students has been crushed, they have no
political energy,'' he said, his eyes downcast. ``If anyone
continues this movement it will be after Deng Xiaoping dies, and it
won't be my generation of students.''

   A suspected IRA car bomb exploded on
a British military base Sunday evening, killing a soldier and
injuring his wife and three children, officials said.
   The bomb went off as the man opened the door of the car and his
family waited to get in, police said.
   The attack, in a housing area on the base, was the second in two
weeks on a British installation in West Germany.
   Officials said bomb disposal experts found another explosive
device in the area and defused it. Residents in nearby apartment
buildings were evacuated and police searched for other bombs.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, but
officials suspected the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to
end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   ``The indications are that this is the kind of attack that can be
attributed to the IRA,'' said Hans-Juergen Foerster, a spokesman for
the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe.
   Squadron Leader Marion Yates, a spokeswoman for the British
military in West Germany, said the explosion ``occurred in a married
living quarters area.
   ``We also understand that three children and a woman were taken
to hospital with injuries,'' she said.
   Hanover police said the injured were the man's wife and three
children and that they were were slightly injured in the blast.
   The names of the victims were not immediately released. Police
and British officials believed the soldier owned the car.
   On June 19, a bomb ripped through the living quarters at a
British military barracks near Osnabrueck. No one was injured in the
blast, but police suspect the IRA was responsible for the attack.
   On June 14, West German prosecutors indicted two suspected IRA
members on attempted murder charges in 1987 and 1988 bombing attacks
aimed at the British military that wounded 46 people, most of them
West Germans.
   The IRA has attacked British troops in Europe in its campaign to
force the British out of Northern Ireland and unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the mostly Roman Catholic
Irish Republic.

   Parishioners at a Roman Catholic church held a
prayer service Sunday, a week after the church was ordered to close,
but an Archdiocese of Detroit spokesman said the action was
understandable.
   About 50 members of Mother of Consolation Church held a 45-minute
prayer service, said Dario Guidarini, president of the parish
council. It was not a formal Mass.
   ``There's no problem with that,'' said archdiocese spokesman Jay
Berman. ``I'm presuming it was something of a spiritual farewell by
the people who participated.''
   Berman said he didn't know whether any other churches already
ordered closed or merged held similar services Sunday. Seven of the
30 targeted parishes closed Friday and two more closed Saturday,
raising the number closed or merged to 25, the archdiocese said last
week.
   On Friday, attorneys representing 17 of the 30 churches filed a
motion to block the closings with the Michigan Court of Appeals. The
court said it would consider the motion no earlier than Wednesday.
   Earlier in the week, Wayne County Circuit Judge James Hathaway
denied a request to block some of the closings, saying civil courts
had no jurisdiction over internal church policy.
   Appeals to the Vatican to overrule Cardinal Edmund Szoka, who
ordered the closings and mergers last fall, also have been rejected.
The church cites declining membership, a shortage of priests and the
costs of maintaining the large churches.
   At least one of the churches have already been sold to a
Protestant congregation.
   Guidarini said he believed church members would comply with a
court decision upholding the archdiocese's order.
   ``We'll talk, but if the appeals court rules against the people,
we probably will surrender the key,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush worshipped at an
oceanside church Sunday, jogged, and planned to play tennis and fish
as he continued to enjoy ``fun stuff'' during a five-day Fourth of
July vacation.
   He also planned to treat neighbors to a gala fireworks display
from his family compound on Monday.
   Although the focus remained on relaxation, aides said that Bush
also was studying briefing materials for next week's trip to Poland,
Hungary and the seven-nation economic summit in Paris.
   And the vacation White House, like many others in the country,
was eagerly awaiting Monday's expected Supreme Court abortion
decision.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that the White
House would react to the decision _ whichever way it goes _ early
Monday afternoon.
   Bush, who supported a woman's right to chose an abortion when he
first ran for president in 1980, more recently has favored a
constitutional amendment to outlaw the procedure.
   Bush began the day with a 6:30 a.m. 20-minute jog along back
roads near his six-acre estate on a point jutting out into the
Atlantic Ocean.
   Later, he attended services at St. Ann's Episcopal Church, which
also enjoys a waterfront location.
   Bush, his wife Barbara and other members of his family occupied a
front pew. Bush helped his ailing 87-year-old mother, Dorothy Walker
Bush, down the aisle and into her seat.
   The older Mrs. Bush, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., is recovering
from a mild stroke she suffered in the spring.
   After church, Bush plunged into a crowd of several hundred
onlookers who had gathered outside the church, shaking hands and
wishing people well.
   ``I hope we get out there on the water, do some fun stuff,'' Bush
told one person in the crowd.
   The crowd of about 200 broke into applause as the first family
emerged from the sanctuary. During the service, the Rev. Laman
Brunner Jr. declared that the small summer-only congregation had
been ``strengthened by the prayers and presence of President and
Mrs. Bush and their family.''
   After church services, Bush played tennis and swam at Walker's
Point. He then boarded his boat Fidelity with wife Barbara and
motored to nearby Cape Porpoise Harbor to pick up some lunch for
their fishing excursion on the water.
   Bush eased his speeedboat into the dock below Tilly's Shanty,
where a patio full of luncheon diners crowded to the railing to see
him get the food from Tilly's.
   Asked what he picked up, the president said, ``Clams and
chowder.''
   Mrs. Bush, in white slacks, visor cap and white pullover with
small American flags, waved to the dockside crowd, which included a
band of reporters and camera crews and called out to one sunburned
person, ``Put on your suntan lotion immediately.''
   The president, in khaki pants and faded red knit shirt, waved
amiably before steering the boat back through the crowd of fishing
boats anchored in the cove.
   The Secret Service took some pains to keep the Tilly's excursion
a secret so as not to attract large crowds. Two vans of pool
reporters and camera crews who accompany the president on public
excursions were driven into a secluded driveway at the edge of
Tilly's parking lot so they would not tip off the arrival.
   But residents there said they had heard from the next-door
neighbors that Bush was coming.
   A hand-lettered sign hung from the dock read, ``Tilly's welcomes
you, President Bush.''
   Employees said it was put up for the weekend visit and they only
found out he was actually coming that morning.
   On Monday evening, the Bush family was to sponsor a 15-minute
fireworks display to be set off from the grounds of the president's
26-room seacoast home.
   The setting off of Independence Day fireworks has become a Bush
family tradition in recent years.
   Because an anonymous donor upped the firepower for the display to
some two tons of rockets and other explosive displays, the Bush
fireworks were moved up to Monday night so as to not compete with
town fireworks scheduled for the Fourth of July.
   The show will be produced by pyrotechnics specialist George
Zambelli.

<TEXT>
   Authorities worked Sunday to locate relatives of
the last victim to be identified among the four people killed when
an explosion and fire tore through the midsection of a 10-story
office building.
   Investigators said Sunday that the woman, in her early 30s, was
identified Saturday night by her boss as a secretary for D.A.M.S.
Inc., a construction consulting company. Her name was withheld until
her family could be notified.
   A total of 23 people were injured in Friday's blaze. As of
Sunday, nine remained hospitalized with two in serious condition,
including a woman who leaped from a sixth-floor window and broke her
legs and an ankle whose condition earlier had been critical.
   A series of powerful electrical explosions apparently set off
when an electrical worker was changing a fuse triggered the blaze
Friday. Much of the building was evacuated quickly, but a number of
workers were trapped and broke out windows to escape choking plumes
of smoke.
   Fire officials focused their investigation Saturday on whether
extensive electrical work being done in the building played a role
in the fire and whether some of that work violated city codes.
   Acting Fire Chief Tom Perrin said those who died could have been
saved had a sprinkler system been installed in the 10-story
building, which was built in 1962, before city codes required
sprinklers in buildings more than eight stories tall.
   The building is managed by American Management Co. of Torrance,
Calif. Harry Komsky, vice president of the company, said Saturday
that an investigation would begin into the fire. He would not
comment on the lack of sprinklers.
   Six federal agencies have offices in the building.

<HEAD>Three `Pot Hunters' Awarded Ownership Of Historic Spanish Sword</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An ancient Spanish sword found on a farm in
northwestern Georgia belongs to the three artifact hunters who dug
it up, not the owner of the farm because he waited too long to claim
it, a judge has ruled.
   Floyd County Superior Court Judge Larry Salmon ordered that the
sword be returned to the three men who dug it up on John Dickey's
land on the Coosa River in 1982, without Dickey's knowledge or
permission.
   Studies indicate the sword was taken to a Coosa Indian village at
the site during the Spanish explorations of Hernando de Soto in 1540
or during a later Spanish expedition in 1560. The village was
attacked in the mid-16th century, and many of the people were killed
by metal weapons.
   Research indicates the sword was made in Spain between 1520 and
1540, and it is an important link establishing that Spaniards came
through Floyd County in the 16th century, Dickey said.
   ``It's going to be a shame if goes somewhere else,'' he said.
   According to the court order filed Friday, Dickey waited too long
before claiming the sword, which had been loaned to the state-run
Etowah Mounds Archaeological Museum. He did not claim ownership
until 1987, after a four-year statute of limitations had run out.
   Dickey said Sunday he did not try to get the sword, known as ``De
Soto's sword,'' back sooner because University of Georgia
archaeologists assured him they were pursuing ownership for the
state.
   Dickey said he first learned of its existence in 1983, when
university archaeologists called him to say the sword that had been
loaned for five years to the Etowah Mounds museum had come from his
farm.
   He said it was taken without his knowledge by ``pot hunters,''
who often enter the dig site. He eventually learned that he had to
file a claim in order to keep the sword from going to the finders,
but it was too late, he said.
   Dickey said he will appeal, adding, ``they admitted themselves
they took it from my place.''
   One of the finders, Larry Itson of Cave Spring, said he is
pleased with Salmon's decision.
   ``I do feel it belongs to us,'' Itson said. ``It was just a real
lucky find _ we weren't trying to steal it.''
   He said he and the other two are seeking a permanent home for the
sword.

   Three barricaded nuns who fled their Morris
Township monastery after a nearly nine-month standoff are in hiding,
but will continue their protest against liberalizations of their
order, a relative said Sunday.
   One of the Carmelite nuns remained locked in the monastery's
infirmary on Sunday, refusing to leave.
   ``They're not giving up,'' said Anne Ercolano, mother of Sister
Maria, one of those who abandoned the monastery early Saturday
morning.
   ``They left because they want to protect their vows,'' Ms.
Ercolano said in a telephone interview Sunday from her home in
Castleton, N.Y. ``They plan on keeping their appeal going as long as
it takes to set things straight.''
   The four nuns had been barricaded in the infirmary of the
Monastery of the Most Blessed Mary of Mount Carmel since Oct. 4,
when their protest shattered the calm behind the building's
white-stone walls and drew international attention.
   The Carmelite order teaches solitude and prayer with a strict
adherence to separation from the outside world. The rebel nuns have
said they took refuge in the infirmary because they feared eviction
by their mother superior, Prioress Teresa Hewitt, for speaking out
against liberalizations she introduced such as television and sweets.
   During the first days of the protest, Mother Hewitt held news
conferences from behind iron bars, denouncing the unruly members of
her flock for ``attempted anarchy.'' Repeated calls to her telephone
number Sunday got only a busy signal.
   The separation took its emotional and physical toll on the
protesters, Ms. Ercolano said, and led them to leave the infirmary
for more comfortable surroundings while the fight continues. She
refused to say where her daughter and the other nuns have gone.
   ``They're getting fresh air, and for once, they're getting some
peace and quiet,'' Ms. Ercolano said. ``They don't want to be
bothered. They just want the case to go forward.''
   The nuns have said they have an appeal before the Apostolica
Signatura, the highest court at the Vatican. Lower arms of the
Vatican have twice ordered the nuns to end the protest, but they
refused and promised to continue protesting until hearing from the
Apostolica Signatura.
   Paterson Diocese spokesman Tim Manning said the diocese was to
serve them notice Monday that if they did not leave, proceedings
would begin to remove them from the order.
   ``That needs to be re-evaluated before the diocese decides the
next move,'' Manning said. ``There are regulations within the order
forbidding the nuns to leave the monastery for any reason with very
few exceptions, and those regulations will have to be reviewed too.''
   Betty Sutton, a lay person who has served as a spokeswoman for
the nuns, said she did not know they were leaving or where they are.
   ``I've noticed a change in their attitude in the last month, as
if somebody was in contact with them who they've been listening
to,'' Mrs. Sutton said.
   The nuns had been questioning their own tactics in the past few
weeks, after adamantly believing they were doing the right thing,
Mrs. Sutton said.
   They thought their protest remained valid even when a letter from
the Vatican ordered them out of the infirmary, she said.
   Five nuns began the protest in October: Sisters John of the
Cross, Philomena, Bernadette, Maria and Teresita.
   Sister John, now Nicole Prescott, returned to her Hillside home
in March citing health reasons.
   Sister Teresita remained in the infirmary.
   Ms. Ercolano said Sister Teresita did not think the nuns should
have left because she felt the monastery was their home.
   Manning said he did not know what would happen with Sister
Teresita. That would be part of a review set for Monday, he said.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Sunday he
has directed the Justice Department to compile a list of federal
prisoners convicted of burning the U.S. flag in anticipation that
they will be freed under a recent Supreme Court decision.
   ``If some one is entitled to relief, then all are entitled to
relief,'' Thornburgh said, referring to the court's 5-4 decision in
a Texas case, in which the court said flag burning is a
constitutionally protected form of political protest.
   However, he said he doubted that more than ``a handful'' of
federal prisoners are involved.
   Thornburgh made the comments on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' in response to a question about Carlos Mendoza-Lugo, a
Puerto Rican nationalist now at the U.S. penitentiary in Atlanta.
   Mendoza-Lugo, who was given a one-year prison sentence after
pleading guilty to a federal charge of flag desecration, last week
filed a petition in U.S. District Court for his release.
   ``My expectation is that he probably will be entitled to that
relief,'' Thornburgh said of Mendoza-Lugo, who burned a U.S. flag
two years ago in front of a U.S. Post Office as a protest for Puerto
Rican independence.
   ``The court's striking down the Texas statute in all likelihood
would encompass the federal statute that was passed at the time of
the flag-burning demonstrations during the Vietnam War,'' the
attorney general said.

   An 11-year-old Californian flying around the world
touched down on Sunday in Kuibyshev, a city that foreigners have
been forbidden to enter for more than four decades, Tass reported.
   Kuibyshev, which lies on the Volga River about 450 miles
southeast of Moscow, is one of many Soviet cities closed to
foreigners because defense-related industries are located there.
   ``We would be happy if our visit to your city opened the doors
for all foreigners,'' the pilot's father, Gary Aliengena, was quoted
as saying by the Soviet news agency.
   The elder Aliengena is accompanying his son, Tony, aboard the
Cessna 210.
   Tass said Kuibyshev has been closed ``since World War II, when
defense industries were evacuated there'' from the Western part of
the Soviet Union, which was then under Nazi German occupation.
   ``For the last 60 years, only one foreign aircraft has landed in
this region without special permission,'' Tass said. ``That was a
fascist bomber ... which in October 1942 tried to destroy a
strategic bridge across the Volga. It was shot down.''
   The area may be opened to foreigners because many of its defense
industries are being converted to the production of civilian goods,
such as furniture, sporting equipment and disposable syringes, Tass
said.
   Soviet reporters in Kuibyshev asked the young aviator, a resident
of San Juan Capistrano, his impressions of the winding Volga.
   ``It is very beautiful, like the Mississippi,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   Tony began learning to fly at the age of 4 and became the
youngest person to solo by flying an ultralight aircraft at age 9 on
March 13, 1988.
   This 47-day, 19,000-mile flight, dubbed Friendship Flight '89,
began June 5. Tony had hoped to meet Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev during a three-day stop in Moscow, but he was told
Gorbachev was too busy.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain, High Wind Across Parts Of South, Into Ohio Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms with damaging wind developed Sunday over the
southern Plains, very heavy rain fell along parts of the Gulf of
Mexico coast, and thunderstorms also broke out on the northern
Plains and near the Great Lakes.
   Record high temperatures were recorded in southwestern Texas. By
midafternoon, Midland reached a record 108 degrees and San Angelo
had tied its mark of 105.
   In contrast, clouds kept temperatures in the chilly 50s and 60s
across the Pacific Northwest.
   Thunderstorms produced wind gusts to between 60 and 70 mph at
more than a dozen locations in central Oklahoma during the morning.
Siding was blown off a house at Enid and wind blew down utility
poles in Lindsay, the National Weather Service said. Thunderstorms
also hit Kansas.
   The combination of a low pressure area in the upper atmosphere
and the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison produced a large area of
rain from the central Gulf Coast to the lower Ohio Valley.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. CDT included
2.05 inches at Wichita, Kan., and 1.26 inches at Evansville, Ind.
   Flash flood watches were posted for south-central and
southeastern Kentucky, central and southeastern Tennessee and
northern and western Alabama.
   Thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain across the central Gulf
Coast states.
   Along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, 5.22 inches of rain fell at
Biloxi, and 3.94 inches fell at Gulfport in about three hours during
the morning. Gulfport got 9.19 inches of rain between midnight and 1
p.m. CDT.
   Four inches of rain fell between midnight and noon CDT at
Cordova, Ala.
   A thunderstorm produced a tornado that caused slight damage in
Mobile County, Ala., the weather service said. A tornado also
occurred briefly at Long Beach, Miss., but no damage was reported.
   Louisiana rivers continued to rise in the aftermath of record
rainfall from the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison, with scattered
storms and showers replacing the unremitting rain of the previous
five days. One town got nearly 29 inches of rain in less than a week.
   Intense thunderstorms moved across northeastern North Dakota and
northern Minnesota during the morning. Hail the size of marbles fell
at Cavalier, N.D., and wind gusted to 50 mph near Whitman, N.D.
   Thunderstorms also developed over sections of northern Indiana
and southwestern Lower Michigan, with a wind gust to 58 mph during a
thunderstorm at Muskegon, Mich.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms were scattered across much of Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at Olympia and Tacoma, Wash., to 108 at Carlsbad, N.M.
Sunday's low in the Lower 48 states was 26 at Truckee, Calif.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the central and eastern Gulf Coast to the upper Great Lakes
region, especially over the upper Ohio Valley and southern
Appalachians. A few showers were forecast over the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs only in the 60s and 70s were predicted in the Pacific
Northwest and along most of the California coast; in the 70s over
Maine and in the southern Appalachians; over 100 across parts of
Colorado and Utah; between 100 and 115 from southwestern Texas
across New Mexico to the desert Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s
across most of the rest of the nation.

   A mother who claimed abductors took her two
baby daughters in nearly identical incidents years apart faces a
court hearing Monday into charges that she concealed the second
infant's death.
   Paula Sims, 29, also faces similar charges in the 1986 death of
her first daughter, although no murder charges in either case have
been filed, authorities said.
   Mrs. Sims, arrested Saturday, was being held in lieu of $250,000
bond in the Madison County Jail, accused of obstruction of justice
and concealing a homicide in the April death of her 6-week-old
daughter, Heather Sims.
   Mrs. Sims and her husband, Robert, reported Heather abducted on
April 29 from their home in this southwestern Illinois city. Her
body was found in a trash can across the Mississippi River in
Missouri several days later.
   In 1986, the couple's firstborn daughter, 13-day-old Loralei, was
reported missing under similar circumstances from their previous
home in Jersey County. Mrs. Sims was charged in May with concealing
a homicide and obstructing justice in that case. She pleaded
innocent, and her trial is set for July 18.
   Mrs. Sims was arrested at her parents' home Saturday evening in
the Heather Sims case, said Madison County Sheriff's Police Sgt. Don
Wein.
   Her attorney, Donald Groshong, could not be reached for comment.
A woman who answered his home phone Sunday said he would not be
available until Wednesday. Mrs. Sims' father also refused to talk
Sunday about the latest charges filed against her.
   ``There won't be any information released on the investigation,''
said Alton police Detective Sgt. Bill Lawrence.
   State's Attorney William Haine has said Madison County police are
moving carefully in their investigation of Heather's death and that
no charges would be brought until police had a strong case.
   Police have said Robert Sims told them he believes his wife may
have killed their daughters accidently. Witnesses have said Mrs.
Sims wanted to give birth to sons, and was unhappy with daughters.
   On June 17, 1986, the Simses told police that a masked gunman
broke into their home in Brighton and abducted Loralei. The
decomposed remains of a baby believed to be Loralei were found
several days later near the couple's home in Brighton, a rural
Jersey County community.
   The Simses refused to answer questions before a grand jury that
considered the case in 1987, citing their Fifth Amendment protection
against self-incrimination. The panel took no action.
   But an investigation into the death of Heather uncovered new
evidence in the first case. A Jersey County grand jury returned an
indictment May 12.
   Police have said previously that Robert Sims is a suspect in both
deaths, but he has not been charged. Attempts to reach Sims for
comment were unsuccessful. Sims' father, Troy, reached by telephone,
said he did not know where his son was.

   Police and troops on Sunday
ringed a village where 11 people were reported killed in a riot
triggered by citizen protests over being forced to become part of
the black homeland of Bophuthatswana.
   Residents of the homeland town of Leeuwfontein said as many as
2,000 people had been rounded up in a police dragnet. A private
civil rights group said some were being beaten and stoned by police
seeking vengeance for the clash Saturday between security forces and
residents.
   The reports could not be confirmed.
   Witnesses said the riot erupted after security forces moved in to
break up an ``illegal'' gathering at a local sports field in the
village of Leeuwfontein, 150 miles northwest of Johannesburg, and
opened fire without warning, killing two people and wounding several
others.
   They said an angry mob then attacked a government armored
vehicle, setting it afire with gasoline bombs. Four of the nine
officers inside burned to death and five others were killed with
axes and rocks as they tried to escape, the witnesses said.
   Police confirmed that two people were killed by gunfire but said
the nine officers were the victims of an ``unprovoked attack.''
Although they were described as police, the type of vehicle involved
is normally used by the army forces there.
   Police and military roadblocks were set up around Leeuwfontein, a
town of about 15,000 that was incorporated Dec. 31 into the tribal
homeland of Bophuthatswana over the objections of most of its
inhabitants.
   Bophuthatswana is one of nearly a dozen black homelands within
South Africa that the government considers nominally independent.
   The homelands are not recognized internationally as separate
countries, and critics say such boundary changes in South Africa
have deprived thousands of people of South African citizenship and
the job opportunities that go with it.
   The homeland system in effect helps South Africa's black
population, now at 28 million. The 5 million whites control the
economy and dominate the government.
   Officers were searching for weapons, ammunition and other
equipment taken from security forces during the turmoil, the South
African Broadcasting Corporation said.
   Journalists were allowed into the sports field where scorched
ground and bloody rocks were visible, but saw none of the detainees
that villagers claimed had been rounded up by police in a sweep that
lasted well into Sunday.
   Observers said the figure of 2,000 arrested was probably
exaggerated. Mrs. Joanne Yawitch, a spokeswoman for the Transvaal
Rural Action Committee (TRAC), a private organization, said ``quite
a lot'' of people had been detained but could not give any figures.
   The South African Press Association quoted her as saying some of
those held were ``gathered into an open space and stoned and beaten
by the police,'' but did not know if anyone had been killed.
   Many other people were said by local residents to have fled into
the thick bush around Leeuwfontein, some of them making their way
across the ill-defined boundaries to refuge in nearby South African
black townships.
   Independent witnesses also confirmed that South African police,
using powerful Casspir armored vehicles, were taking part in the
post-riot dragnet. The South African Press Association earlier
quoted a police spokesman, Lt. R.W. Olivier, as denying TRAC's claim
that South African police were operating in the territory.
   Bophuthatswana, actually seven separate parcels of territory in
the north-central part of the country, has an estimated population
of 1.7 million.
   Some residents of Leeuwfontein have asked South African courts to
overturn a 1988 government edict that added their town of 15,000
people and neighboring Braklaagte, with 9,000 people, to
Bophuthatswana.
   Braklaagte citizens earlier lost a legal appeal, and in March,
police there were accused of beating people who refused to declare
themselves citizens of Bophuthatswana.

   American pianist Van Cliburn, who warmed the hearts
of Soviet music lovers in the midst of the Cold War, on Sunday
repeated the spectacular performance of the piano concerto that
launched his career 31 years ago.
   With roses from the audience at his feet, Cliburn drew bravos and
even screams Sunday night at Tchaikovsky Hall as he performed
Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, joined in the
standing ovation and later expressed their enjoyment privately in a
35-minute meeting backstage with the towering 54-year-old Texan and
his 92-year-old mother.
   ``He played like a god,'' said Dallas Morning News critic John
Ardoin, who flew to Moscow to review the performance. ``I don't see
how anyone under this pressure and much emotion could play like he
did.''
   Before playing, Cliburn told the 1,500 people packed into the
oval hall, ``For 31 years, I have felt like I had two homes. I will
soon be asking permission from your distinguished President
Gorbachev to buy an apartment in Moscow. I will be coming for
much-needed visits for my music, for my soul, to Russia and to
Moscow.''
   Gorbachev and his wife laughed even before the request for an
apartment in housing-short Moscow was translated into Russian. But
Cliburn protested, ``Mr. President, I was serious!''
   Cliburn, who lives in Fort Worth, Texas, said after his meeting
with the Gorbachevs that the Soviet leader told him he would help
arrange the apartment.
   Sunday was Cliburn's third performance in 11 years. He came out
of retirement to play for the Gorbachevs at the White House in 1987.
He will play Monday night at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory, on the
same stage where he triumphed in 1958.
   During applause for the Tchaikovsky concerto, many in the hall
were briefly stunned when a television light next to the Gorbachevs'
box exploded. The Soviet president calmly leaned out, looked at the
smoking light stand and resumed clapping.
   As is typical in the Soviet Union, the concert hall had no air
conditioning and the heat was oppressive. Enthusiastic fans crowded
the aisles while hundreds more waited outside for a glimpse of
Cliburn.
   The pianist, his waves of hair perfectly coifed despite the heat,
also played Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat Major, a Debussy
prelude and the Schumann-Liszt Widmung.
   One of those in the audience was Nake Flock, who said she heard
Cliburn play in Moscow in 1958, when he won the Tchaikovsky
Competition for young pianists with his performance of the
Tchaikaovsky concerto.
   Ms. Flock said she flew to Moscow from her home in Leipzig, East
Germany, and paid $46.50 for a concert ticket that had a face value
of $3.41.
   ``His technique hasn't changed,'' said Ms. Flock, the mother of a
piano student at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory. ``But he has become
more impulsive, more sentimental.''
   Some 20 players in the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra backing him
were members of the same ensemble 31 years ago that accompanied him
on the night he won the Tchaikovsky Competition.
   The Gorbachevs toasted Cliburn with tea, apple pie and red wine,
said Susan Tilley, president of the Van Cliburn Foundation in Fort
Worth, Texas, who was one of a handful of people allowed into the
meeting. The foundation sponsors an international piano competition
and concert series.
   ``They said come back any time,'' Cliburn said after the meeting.

<TEXT>
   Theodore Roosevelt,
celebrated in stone on Mount Rushmore 50 years ago, should be
celebrated today for his environmental spirit, Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan Jr. said Sunday.
   ``We're not here just to talk about stewardship of our natural
resources. ... We're here to act,'' Lujan told an estimated 4,000 to
5,000 people who turned out to commemorate the 50th anniversary of
the unveiling of Roosevelt's face on the monument.
   As the audience sang along with a military band that played ``God
Bless America,'' a song introduced at the original dedication of
Roosevelt's chiseled face 50 years ago, a 90-by-45-foot U.S. flag
that had been hung on the mountain was drawn back to reveal the
sculpture once again.
   When sculptor Gutzon Borglum decided Roosevelt's features would
be carved next to the 60-foot-tall faces of George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, many people wondered if
Roosevelt really belonged with the other presidents on the granite
mountain.
   But Lujan and other speakers said Roosevelt was a good choice for
the huge sculpture known as the Shrine of Democracy because he was a
president for the common person and a leader in the conservation
movement.
   Lujan said President Bush's administration is dedicated to
protecting the environment by reducing acid rain, reversing damage
to the ozone layer, restoring wetland nesting areas for waterfowl
and protecting endangered species.
   The administration will work to promote the nation's economic
growth, but not at the expense of the environment, said the interior
secretary, who played key roles in environmental legislation during
two decades in Congress.
   ``Make no mistake about it: Our commitment to conserving our
natural resources ... will never be sacrificed to corporate
profit,'' he said.
   The huge red, white and blue flag was not placed in front of the
sculpture as scheduled at dawn because of wind gusting to 35 mph.
   A crew of workers on the mountain raised the 300-pound banner for
the first time at mid-morning, quickly lowering it because the wind
was too strong, threatening their safety and the flag itself.
   The program stayed on schedule as winds dropped and work crews
hoisted the flag into position during the speeches, which were given
in the ampitheater at the base of Mount Rushmore.
   Gov. George Mickelson said it was fitting that Roosevelt was
honored on the mountain because he traveled extensively in the
territory that would become the state of South Dakota several
decades before becoming president in 1901.
   Roosevelt first arrived in the 1880s to hunt and buy ranch land
in the area that later became North Dakota, Mickelson said.
   The governor said Roosevelt's travels in the West led to his
later efforts to conserve the nation's resources and to place more
than 100 million acres of forest land into the public trust.
   ``He knew that somehow, the hills and forests we love so much
must be protected for future generations,'' Mickelson said.

Cabinet members and set off a bomb that killed at least two people,
police said.
   Premadasa and the Cabinet ministers were in a secret well-guarded
location and were unharmed, authorities said. Thirty people were
injured, many critically.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which occurred
shortly after midnight Saturday near Mahiyangana, about 70 miles
northeast of Colombo. Police blamed the left-wing People's
Liberation Front, which opposes tactics used by the government to
end the insurgency by Tamil rebels.
   Police would not say if the attack was aimed at anyone in
particular.
   ``It could have been at anybody. We don't know,'' said one police
officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Elsewhere, authorities said security forces arrested 3,237 youths
suspected of belonging to the People's Liberation Front. It was the
single largest crackdown against the group in nearly two years.
   Also Sunday, 18 people were reported killed by Sinhalese hit
squads in central and northern Sri Lanka.
   Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
contend they are discriminated against in jobs and education.
Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the
government and military.
   According to police in Mahiyangana, several armed youths entered
the grounds where 200,000 to 300,000 people gathered for the 11th
Annual Village Reawakening Festival, and they exploded a bomb near
the main stage.
   The 10-day festival is aimed at encouraging people to build
better houses for themselves and to repair their rundown villages.
   The attack, the first on such a festival, came despite increased
security, including the posting of a large number of military
commands around the grounds.
   The People's Liberation Front has been blamed for more than 3,500
killings since July 1987, when Indian peacekeeping forces arrived on
this troubled island to enforce a peace accord between the
Sinhalese-dominated government and militant Tamils, who have been
fighting for a separate homeland since 1983.
   The front contends the accord grants too many concessions to the
minority Tamils, and it says the presence of Indian soldiers
threatens Sri Lanka's sovereignty. Front members have vowed to kill
anyone who supports the pact.
   India became involved in the ethnic problems of the nation
because its own 60 million Tamils are sympathetic to the rebel cause.
   In addition to the bombing, police blamed Sinhalese extremists
for the deaths of seven moderate Sinhalese in Kurunegala, about 65
miles northeast of Colombo, and for seven other deaths in Colombo.
   Officers also said they found four Sinhalese youths shot to death
in the town of Kegalle, 50 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Armed with automatic weapons and empowered by tough emergency
laws, soldiers and police raided homes and arrested 3,200 suspected
radicals in the Sinhalese-dominated south, officials said.
   Armed troops also forced open a hostel in Colombo and arrested 37
medical interns who allegedly belong to the front. The weekend
newspaper Sun claimed the medical facullty of Colombo University has
been the vangaurd of the front's anti-government campaign.

   A Colorado forest fire that burned two homes and forced
evacuation of a small town spread uncontained Sunday, but California
firefighters neared full control of a 7,840-acre blaze in Riverside
County.
   Elsewhere in California, a fire that burned 3 acres in Sequoia
National Park and 200 adjacent acres of federal wildlands in the
Three Rivers area of Tulare County was controlled Sunday. The park's
giant trees were not threatened, officials said.
   Crews fought two out-of-control fires in eastern Utah.
   Colorado firefighters battling a 960-acre fire that burned two
houses and forced evacuation of a small community in the Glade Park
area near Grand Junction faced unseasonably warm weather Sunday,
with highs in the 90s.
   Officials were prepared for more blazes in Colorado's tinder-dry
high country over the long Fourth of July weekend. But other fires
that had broken out since Wednesday were reported contained or near
containment.
   The fire in the Glade Park area broke out Saturday and threatened
several more buildings Sunday, said Kelle Keeler, spokeswoman for
the Bureau of Land Management in Grand Junction.
   From 25 to 50 residents were evacuated and remained out of their
homes Sunday morning. Officials said many of Glade Park's houses are
summer homes, and it was uncertain how many people were there
Saturday to be evacuated. No injuries were reported.
   ``They are making real good headway on putting the fire in
containment,'' Keeler said Sunday morning, when the fire was ``calm
and inactive.''
   Keeler said 230 firefighters were at the scene Sunday, plus three
bulldozers, 15 fire engines, two helicopters and two air tankers.
The cause of the blaze was under investigation.
   Several of the Colorado fires were blamed on lightning, but a
5-acre blaze on private land Saturday near the Pike National Forest
was attributed to fireworks, officials said. It was extinguished
within two hours,.
   California's big Riverside County fire began Tuesday and burned
12 homes and vacation cabins. Lost watershed and structures were
valued at $1.1 million and officials estimated firefighting costs at
$1.9 million. The cause remained under investigation.
   Improved weather _ lighter wind and higher humidity _ allowed
progress against the blaze, and U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Rosalinda Ewen said many of the 2,300 firefighters had been sent
home.
   The Ortega Highway, linking inland Lake Elsinore with San Juan
Capistrano on the Orange County coast, remained closed as a safety
measure.
   Utah firefighters also were hampered by searing heat and
extremely low humidity.
   Ray Tate, public information officer for the Uintah Basin Fire
Center, said the Rough Canyon fire 23 miles west of Duchesne and
another 30 miles south of Vernal continued to burn out of control,
although containment was estimated for the former on Tuesday.
   The Rough Canyon fire, which was fought by two helicopters and
133 firefighters, consumed 275 acres of mostly Forest Service land.
The other fire burned some 350 acres of sagebrush, pinion juniper
and grass.

   A Continental Airlines jet with 132
passengers aboard narrowly avoided a collision with a small plane
that turned into its path shortly after takeoff, aviation
authorities said.
   Federal Aviation Administration duty officer Jack Doyle said
Continental Flight 176 came within 100 feet of a single-engine
Bonanza that had just taken off from an adjacent runway at John
Wayne Airport shortly after 3 p.m. Friday.
   Doyle said the pilot of the small plane was told by air traffic
controllers to turn left after takeoff, but instead turned right,
crossing the Boeing 737 jetliner's flight path.
   The pilot of the airliner had to turn to avoid hitting the
smaller plane, Doyle said.
   The Continental flight was bound for Denver and arrived 12
minutes early without any problem, said Laura Duin, Continental
reservation supervisor in Denver.
   No injuries were reported. The FAA is investigating the incident.

<HEAD>Uprising Leaders Condemn U.S., Urge Strikes By Israeli Arabs</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with 12 wounded, report on authorization
to use plastic bullets against masked Arabs, details on leaflet.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Underground leaders of the Palestinian revolt on
Sunday condemned the U.S. position in the Middle East conflict as
``biased toward the Zionist enemy'' and called for a strike by the
810,000 Arabs within Israel.
   In the West Bank, a 12-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed
in a clash between troops and stone-throwing Arabs. Twelve Arabs
were reported wounded in other incidents.
   The death raised to 539 the number of Palestinians killed in the
18-month revolt against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Twenty-three Israelis also have died.
   In another development, a report on Israel radio's English
service said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Sunday's Cabinet
meeting that ``the Justice Ministry had authorized the use of
plastic bullets against any Arab male in the (occupied) territories
whose face was masked.''
   The report did not elaborate and it was not carried on any
subsequent Israel radio broadcasts Sunday night.
   An official in the Defense Ministry, speaking on condition of
anonymity, would neither confirm nor deny the report, but he said
the Defense Ministry asked the Justice Ministry last month to
liberalize orders to open fire.
   The official said the military asked permission to shoot the
masked leaders of violent demonstrations with sometimes lethal
plastic-tipped bullets ``under very, very, special circumstances.''
He did not specify the circumstances.
   If the measures were approved in principle by the Justice
Ministry, the ministry would then decide under what conditions the
military could open fire and the Defense Ministry would then issue
new orders, the spokesman said.
   An army spokesman said no such orders have been issued.
   Under current regulations, soldiers may only open fire at
Palestinians who are building roadblocks or preparing to attack
soldiers or if their lives are in danger, the army spokesman said.
   Many Palestinian protesters mask their faces in Arab keffiyehs,
or headdresses.
   The Palestinian condemnation of the United States came in a
leaflet by the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising. It noted
``the deteriorating economic situation'' in Israel and called for a
further boycott of Israeli products.
   For the first time, uprising leaders called for a two-day strike
among the 810,000 Israeli Arabs and urged them to ``provide material
aid and food'' to their brethren in the occupied lands.
   Radical Palestinian groups have recently increased their efforts
aimed at inciting Israeli Arabs, who live among the 3.5 million
Jews, to take a more active role in the uprising. Some Israeli Arabs
have staged sympathy strikes.
   The leaflet criticized the U.S. position as ``always biased
toward the Zionist enemy and supportive of the elections under
occupation,'' and it praised European countries for supporting a
U.N.-sponsored peace conference with the participation of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The leaflet came as President Bush reportedly reassured Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of his support for Shamir's peace plan,
which calls for balloting in the occupied territories and
negotiations with elected Palestinians on limited self-rule.
Uprising leaders reject the plan because it does not call for an
independent Palestinian state.
   Israel radio said the backing came in a letter, but Shamir's
spokesman, Avi Pazner, said the letter had not been received.
   The daily Haaretz newspaper reported Bush was angry over Shamir's
support for building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories,
which run counter to U.S. policy calling for Israel to give up land
in exchange for peace.
   Haaretz quoted Bush as saying ``I don't understand this Shamir''
as he banged his palm on a table at a meeting in Washington. The
paper said the session was attended by Sen. Daniel Inoyue, D-Hawaii,
and Seymour Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major
Jewish Organizations.
   The fatal clash Sunday broke out when troops ``encountered
violent resistance'' as they entered the village of Idna to arrest
suspects, an army spokesman said. He said the army was investigating
the circumstances of the youth's death.
   The victim, identified as Khalil Awad Tabran, was shot in the
chest, said officials at Alia Hospital in nearby Hebron.
   Twelve Palestinians were wounded Sunday by army gunfire,
including a 24-year-old woman listed in critical condition with a
gunshot wound to the chest, Arab hospital officials said. An army
spokesman confirmed two of the wounded.
   About 30 Israeli mayors chained themselves outside Shamir's
office Sunday to protest unemployment, which has reached 8.6 percent.

<TEXT>
   Civil rights leaders commemorated the day their
movement became law Sunday by praying at the crypt of Martin Luther
King Jr. and challenging President Bush to live up to his stated
commitment to their cause.
   ``Mr. Bush has got to get up and make the White House the right
house,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference. ``It's not enough to talk that
talk. We need him to walk that walk.''
   The SCLC was marking the 25th anniversary of the passage of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned segregation in public
facilities and has been used in court actions against discrimination
in the workplace.
   Lowery, one of several civil rights leaders who met with Bush
Friday, said recent Supreme Court decisions against affirmative
action programs have left black leaders doubting that the president
would work to protect progress made under the law.
   ``I'm going to remain hopeful for the time being,'' Lowery said.
``Mr. Bush has good instincts. He wants to do what's right in this
regard.''
   On Friday, Bush called on Congress to reauthorize the Civil
Rights Commission, which is set to expire Nov. 30. But earlier last
week, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the Bush administration
would not push Congress to overturn the Supreme Court decisions.
   Lowery said civil rights leaders are concerned that Bush's latest
statements might be just rhetoric, and added that Bush is ``gonna
have to make up his mind'' on either bolstering black membership in
the GOP or pleasing ultra-conservatives.
   Lowery was joined at King's gravesite by Rosa Parks, whose
refusal to sit in a segregated section of a Montgomery, Ala., bus in
1955 sparked the civil rights movement.
   Mrs. Parks said Bush's statements ``sounded good, but we are
waiting for real, real action.''
   ``We cannot lull ourselves to sleep with words,'' she said.
   About 200 people gathered for the prayer service, during which
Lowery blasted Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor for her
position against affirmative action.
   ``Glory be to God, if it weren't for affirmative action she'd
still be in Arizona presiding over a microwave,'' Lowery said,
adding that the American public should ``remind Sandra who she is.''
   ``We bled too profusely and died too young to let any Supreme
Court turn us around,'' Lowery said.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
clung to life in a Honolulu hospital Sunday, and his wife Imelda
said that made her 60th birthday happy.
   ``I would like to thank Ferdinand for the best birthday present
he has ever given me _ his life,'' the former Philippine First Lady
said after a Roman Catholic Mass at the couple's home-in-exile here.
   Marcos, who was president of the Philippines for 20 years before
being ousted in February 1986, remained in critical condition Sunday
at St. Francis Medical Center, where he has been hospitalized since
January.
   The exiled ruler has suffered massive organ failure, is battling
a widespread infection and is being kept alive by machines.
   ``I know he survived all of this because God has blessed us with
a miracle,'' Mrs. Marcos said.
   After the Mass, Mrs. Marcos read the inscription in a book her
husband of 35 years gave her last October, shortly before the couple
was indicted in the United States for allegedly stealing more than
$100 million from the Philippine treasury and stashing it in the
United States.
   Marcos wrote the book to chronicle his version of the events that
led to his downfall.
   In the inscription, Marcos promised not to try to regain power if
allowed home.
   Asked later whether Mrs. Marcos read the inscription as a message
to Philippine President Corazon Aquino, who has steadfastly refused
to let the Marcoses come home, she replied, ``It's a message to all
of humanity ... of everyone's right to freedom.''
   But she admitted she was not optimistic that Mrs. Aquino, who
claims Marcos stole billions of dollars during his rule, would
relent.

<HEAD>JVC Jazz Festival Ends with Clark Terry and Friends</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's JVC Jazz Festival ended with a
tribute to trumpeter Clark Terry that was a neatly planned,
well-played concert which built to an exciting set with master
musicians Oscar Peterson and Louis Bellson.
   Terry invited the musicians and was the featured performer on
``Clark Terry and Friends'' at Town Hall on Saturday night.
   The final set had Peterson on piano, Bellson on drums, Kenny
Burrell on electric guitar and bassist Victor Gasklin. Terry joined
them on their fourth number, to play a warm solo on ``My Romance.''
   The evening began with a group representing the Big B-A-D Band
that Terry formed in 1970. The trombone section was featured on
``Blues in My Shoes.'' Terry sang ``I Want a Little Girl,'' backed
by saxophonist Lew Tabackin, a charming interlude.
   Irene Reid sang, accompanied by pianist Don Friedman, drummer
Butch Ballard, who once played with Elmer Snowden, and bassist
Marcus McLaurine. She was effective with a song without rhymes or
repeated musical phrases, with a lush Duke Ellington tune and a
string of Count Basie blues songs.
   ``Trumpets No End,'' the arrangement of ``Blue Skies'' that Mary
Lou Williams did featuring six trumpets in the Ellington Band, gave
its name to a segment by seven trumpet players. After Jimmy Owens,
Bob Montgomery, Rod McGahie, Joe Newman, Johnny Helms and Terry
played solos, Jon Faddis pretty much wiped them up with high notes,
speed and clear, long-held notes.
   Terry played in the bands of Lionel Hampton, Charlie Barnet,
Count Basie and, from 1951 to '59, Duke Ellington. After that he was
regularly on the Tonight Show, then played with Peterson. He led a
group with Bob Brookmeyer in the 1970s. At Town Hall Terry's sense
of humor surfaced when he recited, with feeling and emphatic
gestures, a poem in nonsense syllables.
   The next to last set was called Clark Terry and the Spacemen,
because Ellington, inspired by Sputnik, called small groups from his
band the Spacemen. Saturday night's included Aaron Bell, who played
bass for Ellington, on piano, other Ellington alumni, Jimmy
Hamilton, Britt Woodman and Norris Turney, plus Haywood Henry,
Virgil Jones, Ballard and bassist Victor Gaskin.
   They played an Ellington set, ``Jones,'' ``Primpin' for the
Prom,'' a smoothly mellow ``Mood Indigo'' and a rousing ``In a
Mellowtone.''

<TEXT>
   Syrian gunners blasted the Christian
sector of the Lebanese capital with shellfire Sunday, and rival
militias backed by Syria and Iran clashed in street battles in
Moslem west Beirut, police said.
   Ten people were killed and 29 wounded, they said.
   A Soviet envoy and the foreign ministers of three Arab countries
working for a settlement of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war arrived
in Syria.
   Since the latest round of fighting began in March, 396 people
have been killed and 1,532 wounded.
   Police said eight people were killed Sunday and 20 wounded in the
Syrian bombardment of Christian east Beirut's sprawling residential
districts of Ashrafiyeh and Furn el-Shubbak.
   One shell crashed into the bedroom of Antoine Abi-Aad, 31, a
Maronite Catholic priest, and his wife Renee, 24, in Ashrafiyeh.
They were killed as they slept, said a police spokesman, who cannot
be named under standing rules.
   The Syrians also pounded a 25-mile coastal stretch to prevent
food, fuel and arms supplies from reaching the Christian enclave
north of Beirut, police said. Christian militia gunners responded
with intermittent barrages of 155mm shellfire.
   The police spokesman said two people were killed and nine wounded
in the fighting between the Moslem militias. The gun battles raged
all night and through Sunday morning between the Syrian-backed
Shiite Moslem Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or party
of God.
   It was the first major clash between the factions since the death
of Iran's revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on
June 3.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah and the more secular Amal have been
fighting for control of the million-strong Shiite community, the
largest single sect in Lebanon.
   The latest round of fighting in Lebanon's civil war broke out on
March 8 between army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 troops,
most of them Christians, and an alliance of Syria's 40,000 troops
and Druse forces. Hezbollah and Amal had stayed out of that
confrontation.
   Soviet envoy Alexander Bessmertnykh flew to Damascus after
winning a pledge from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's government,
Syria's main Arab foe, to halt arms shipments to the Lebanese
Christians if the Syrians stopped their daily bombardment of the
Christian enclave.
   Syria's government newspaper Al-Thawra said the Iraqi pledge was
``a maneuver ... to mislead the Arab League committee.''
   Bessmertnykh carried a message from Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev to Syrian President Hafez Assad, said a Soviet source who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Syria and Iraq have close ties with Moscow. The Soviets were
Iraq's main arms suppliers during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, and
Syria is Moscow's leading Arab ally.
   The Arab League committee includes King Hassan II of Morocco,
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria.
The 22-nation Arab League has asked the committee to find a
settlement to Lebanon's war by November.
   But so far it has been unable to enforce even a cease-fire called
in May.
   The foreign ministers of the three countries were in Damascus to
discuss the truce violations.
   Aoun lashed out at the Arab committee for keeping silent on
Syrian violations of the cease-fire.
   ``The Arab committee is becoming a helpless spectator while the
Syrians persist in their daily defiance of the Arab League
cease-fire calls. This is pushing the Lebanese to despair,'' he said
in a statement broadcast by Christian radio stations.
   ``If the Arab League, which is supported by the United Nations,
is incapable of making the Syrians respect its resolutions, then it
must declare the Syrians as the defiers,'' Aoun said.
   Syria entered Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate to halt
the civil war. Christians say the Syrians lost their role as neutral
peacekeepers because they have sided with Moslems in the civil war.
   Meanwhile, in southern Lebanon, two militiamen of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army were wounded Sunday when their
armored personnel carrier hit a mine, police reported.
   A police spokesman said the explosion occurred in Kfar Falous in
Israel's self-declared ``security zone,'' a strip of Lebanese border
territory the Israelis have occupied since 1985.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
said the Lebanese militia retaliated by shelling the villages of
Ka'kaiyat il-Jisr and Zoutar Sharqiyyeh. No casualties were reported.

   The opposition socialists pulled ahead of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party on Monday in municipal elections
viewed as a gauge of how well the scandal-ridden Liberal Democrats
will fare in national elections.
   Women were expected to tilt the vote in favor of the opposition
following a campaign that focused on a sex scandal in the governing
party.
   With 47 of the 128 seats in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly
decided, the Japan Socialist Party had won 22, nine more than the
Liberal Democrats, according to the Japan Broadcasting Corp.
   The early results were considered significant since the
Socialists held only 11 assembly seats coming into Sunday's
election. The Liberal Democrats had 63.
   The Clean Government Party had five seats, the Communist Party
three, and independent candidates had won four, the television
network said.
   About 5.18 million people, or 58.7 percent of the eligible
voters, cast ballots Sunday. That was up from 53.5 percent in the
last election in 1985, the Tokyo Board of Elections said.
   The election was being closely watched as a sign of how the
Liberal Democrats, who have ruled Japan since 1954, will do in a
national election July 23 for half the seats in the upper house of
the parliament, or Diet.
   More than 61 percent of registered women voted, compared to 56.16
percent of men, the board said.
   The high turnout, especially among women, was expected to favor
the opposition. The opposition campaign focused on national issues,
including an unpopular 3 percent consumption tax passed by the
Liberal Democratic Party; an influence-peddling scandal that forced
the resignation of Prime Minster Noboru Takeshita; and a sex scandal
centering on reports the new prime minister, Sousuke Uno, has kept
paid mistresses.
   The Kyodo News Service reported a women's group in Miyazaki,
western Japan, gathered signatures from more than 1,000 women on a
petition for the prime minister saying, ``It is an embarrassment for
Japan to be represented at the summit by a person who tramples over
women.''
   Uno took office last month, and soon afterward, Japanese media
published an interview with a former geisha who said Uno paid her
for sex. The woman later appeared in a television interview, and
reports that Uno kept other mistresses filled the press last week.
   The scandal has further tainted the Liberal Democratic Party,
which was badly shaken by the so-called Recruit scandal, which
forced the resignation of Takeshita on June 2.
   The scandal involved the Recruit Co., a publishing conglomerate
accused of handing out millions of dollars in political
contributions and bargain-priced stock in exchange for political
favors.
   Only 25 percent of Tokyo voters polled recently by the Asahi
Shimbun newspaper said they planned to support Liberal Democrat
candidates, down from 34 percent who expressed support in 1985.
   A Kyodo News Service poll released Thursday showed 16 percent
supporting the Japan Socialist Party, the main opposition party,
while support for the Liberal Democrats had fallen from 42.4 to only
13.2 percent.
   A poll published in the Mainichi Shimbun, a national daily, said
the ruling party was likely to lose heavily.
   The poll showed women were breaking away from the Liberal
Democratic Party. Women who said they would shift from the governing
party to the socialists jumped from 8 percent to 18 percent, while
those who said they would vote for the Liberal Democrats shrank from
33 to 18 percent.

<HEAD>Former General Says He Dealt in Drugs to Invest in Tourism</HEAD>

   A former major general in the Cuban military
testified at his court-martial that he trafficked drugs because he
wanted to invest in tourism projects like hotels, the Cuban news
agency said Sunday.
   Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, who received medals for his wartime deeds,
is one of 15 high-ranking military officers charged with high
treason and trafficking in cocaine, diamonds and ivory.
   They were stripped of their rank and expelled from the Communist
Party last week. Three major generals began hearing the case Friday.
The 15 could face the firing squad if convicted.
   The Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina said Sunday that
Ochoa and two aides, Jorge Martinez and Antonio Rodriguez, admitted
their actions ``seriously endangered the prestige, morality and
dignity of Cuba, its armed forces, people and government.''
   The agency said they ``showed themselves on Cuban TV to be
convinced that their guilt of narcotics trafficking and other crimes
requires the most severe sanction.''
   Earlier dispatches from Havana said the defendants belonged to a
secret division of the Interior Ministry that smuggled medicine,
hospital supplies and computers to circumvent a U.S. trade embargo.
One of the defendants is former Interior Minister Jose Abrantes.
   Ochoa said on Sunday that he was ``thinking big'' when he decided
to become involved in international drug trafficking in 1987, Prensa
Latina said.
   He said he planned to invest large amounts of money in hotel
construction but did not intend to turn the island into a drug
trafficking center.
   Ochoa said he had opened an account at the Banco Viscaya in
Panama in 1985. He did not give the purpose of the account, but said
it was unrelated to drug trafficking.
   The defendants are accused of helping Colombia's Medellin drug
cartel smuggle cocaine into the United States. Ochoa and some of the
others have said they dealt in cocaine to earn dollars to help
Cuba's faltering economy.
   As a major general, Ochoa took part in or directed fighting in
Angola and Ethiopia, and served on missions in Venezuela and to help
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista regime.
   Also Sunday, Cuba expelled a correspondent for the Reuters news
service, Gilles Trequesser, for ``falsely and maliciously''
reporting that two Communist Party officials wanted asylum in a
foreign embassy.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Hector Argiles said Trequesser
``falsely and maliciously'' linked ``the alleged search for asylum''
with the drug case.
   Prensa Latina said Trequesser reported that Osmani Cienfuegos, a
member of the Council of State and of the ruling Communist Party's
Political Bureau, and Abraham Maciques, president of the state
trading Corporacion Cubanacan, had asked for asylum at an unnamed
foreign embassy.
   The London-based news agency confirmed the expulsion. It said
Trequesser had been in Cuba for two years.

   A Greek tanker ringed by Coast Guard vessels
and a tugboat with pollution booms aboard began its journey to
drydock Sunday morning, nine days after hitting a rock and spilling
420,000 gallons of oil into the ocean.
   The World Prodigy, with a Coast Guard official aboard to oversee
its captain and crew on the trip to New York, was nudged by the
tugboat to loosen its anchor chain and then began moving under its
own power with a puff of black smoke from its engines.
   A Coast Guard helicopter passed over the World Prodigy and saw no
oil leaking from the vessel, said Petty Officer Brian Kelley of the
Coast Guard's Boston office. He said Coast Guard aircraft would
check the ship periodically during the trip.
   The ship will enter New York harbor during Monday afternoon's
high tide and will be repaired at New York Shipyard Corp., on the
site of the old Brooklyn Navy Yard.
   Coast Guardsmen and onlookers at Brenton Point State Park were
not sorry to see the tanker depart.
   ``The sooner they get out of here, the better,'' said Gunn.
   ``I'm glad to see it's gone,'' agreed Joseph Sweetland of
Middletown, a regular Sunday visitor to the park. ``There's a lot
better view out here and with that thing sitting out there, anything
could happen, I guess.''
   Others at Brenton Point praised the Coast Guard's quick response
to the spill and said it would not leave a lasting mark on Newport.
   ``After three months goes by, this is all going to be
forgotten,'' said Rich Boccio of Seekonk, Mass. ``You come back here
next year and ask people about the oil tanker, and I'd say 40
percent of the people won't know about the oil tanker.''
   A Narragansett Bay pilot was aboard as the World Prodigy made its
way out of the treacherous waters surrounding Brenton Reef. The
tanker's captain, who faces federal charges of violating pollution
laws, has admitted he made a mistake in not having a pilot aboard
when the accident happened on the afternoon of June 23.
   Soon after departure, all but one of the Coast Guard vessels
dropped back from the tanker. The tugboat, carrying booms in case of
another accident with the small amount of oil remaining on the ship,
was the only vessel scheduled to accompany the tanker on its entire
trip to New York.
   The World Prodigy was carrying nearly 8 million gallons of home
heating oil at the time of the accident. Most of that oil was pumped
out of the ship immediately afterward, but a layer of between a
quarter-inch and 2 inches thick remained, said Coast Guard Lt. Paul
Wolf. He said the oil was being held in place by 24 feet of water
and was not considered a threat to leak out.
   The oil that spilled, a relatively light form of oil compared
with the crude oil that has caused such problems on Alaska beaches,
has largely evaporated or dissipated.
   The Coast Guard vessels were not scheduled to accompany the
tanker all the way to New York.

   Voters on Sunday tested the strength and
honesty of the historically powerful Institutional Revolutionary
Party in elections in five states. Troops guarded polls in Baja
California and Michoacan, where close races were expected.
   Also voting were residents of the states of Campeche, Chihuahua
and Zacatecas.
   Polls officially closed at 6 p.m., but some remained open longer
to allow people waiting in line at closing time to vote. Under
Mexican law, the government has a week to announce election results.
   Opposition party members, congressmen and the independent Front
for the Defense of the Vote monitored the 1,166 polling places in
Baja, an opposition stronghold, to see if President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari's promise of clean elections was upheld.
   ``If he doesn't accomplish this, everybody will see it and people
will stop believing in him,'' said Jorge Barnetche of the
3,000-member independent citizens' group.
   The opposition National Action Party alleged that officials in
the northwestern border state used forged documents to register some
people more than once. It also said officials burned 24,000 voter
identification cards of purported dead people last week but that
many of the cards belonged to opposition supporters.
   Some of Baja's 882,461 registered voters lined up early to choose
a new governor, mayor and state legislature. The other states were
choosing state legislatures. Chihuahua also was electing all 67
mayors.
   In a hillside neighborhood of tar paper and plywood shacks in the
border city of Tijuana, Baja voters said they began gathering
outside polling stations at 5:30 a.m.
   ``I vote to improve the government. They make promises but don't
live up to them,'' said Antonia Cerillo, one of dozens waiting in
line at one polling place.
   The governing party faced tough opposition in Baja California
from conservatives and in Michoacan, the home of leftist opposition
leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who ran for president last year.
   Some polls opened late in Michoacan, which was electing a new
24-member legislature. The governing party held 18 of these seats
from the last election in 1986.
   In elections last year, Michoacanos gave 64 percent of their vote
in the presidential election to Cardenas, heading a leftist
coalition. He recently formed the Democratic Revolutionary Party.
   In Chihuahua, congressman Pedro Cesar Acosta of the conservative
National Action Party, or PAN, said no major incidents had been
reported by late afternoon but there were problems with the
indelible ink used to mark voters' fingers, a common complaint in
Mexican elections.
   ``In some cases it works, to the point of burning the finger,''
he said by telephone. ``In others it doesn't make a stain until
hours later. In my case, it worked from the beginning and hasn't
come off and it's been four hours since I voted.''
   PAN made substantial gains in Chihuahua in 1983 but lost ground
to the PRI three years later in elections marked by allegations of
fraud. Abel Vicencio Tovar, another PAN congressman, alleged the ink
was part of PRI's ``operation carrousel'' to have voters go from one
polling place to another casting ballots.
   In Baja, the latest polls showed a dead heat between conservative
Ernesto Ruffo and governing party candidate Margarita Ortega.
   Ruffo, 37, a popular former mayor of the Pacific coast city of
Ensenada, said Saturday night that the situation was calm despite
his party's complaints of voter irregularities.
   ``We're used to these irregularities. But we will watch officials
and we are confident that the election will be successful,'' said
Ruffo. If he wins, he will become the first governor from an
opposition party since the governing party was founded and rose to
power 60 years ago.
   Ms. Ortega, 38, is considered honest even by her opponents and,
if she wins, she would become Mexico's third woman governor.
   The opposition was hopeful of winning in this prosperous border
state because its citizens gave Salinas only one third of their
votes in last year's election.
   A poll published Friday in the Mexico City daily La Jornada
showed Ruffo at 33.7 percent and Ms. Ortega with 32.7 percent of
potential voters.
   Opposition parties claimed widespread voter fraud in the
presidential election, but the governing party denied that. Salinas
has since campaigned against fraud and corruption.

<HEAD>Probes Spur Tough Ethics, Accounting Practices at Gulf Power</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Repeating for all needing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigations of alleged theft, cover-ups
and illegal political contributions at Gulf Power Co. have prompted
new accounting and ethics policies among the toughest in corporate
America, the utility says.
   At least three Gulf Power employees have been fired or pressured
to resign because of alleged financial wrongdoing, company officials
say. Others were reprimanded or reassigned as part of efforts to
halt corruption.
   A federal grand jury probe, a mysterious plane crash and the
disappareance of a graphic designer who worked for the utility all
helped to place Gulf Power under intense scrutiny in the last year.
   ``I am truly convinced that Gulf Power is on the right track
now,'' Dr. Reed Bell, a Pensacola pediatrician and chairman of the
utility's audit committee, wrote in a June 26 letter to employees.
``Virtually all of the problems ... I believe to be part of the
company's past.''
   Bell has been a critic of past practices, accusing management of
keeping him and other outside directors in the dark about what he
termed unethical conduct, misconduct, mismanagement cover-ups and
money laundering.
   Hanging on walls throughout Gulf's headquarters now is a copy of
an ethics code prohibiting the doctoring of company books, using
corporate funds for indirect political contributions, breaking laws
for business ends, having financial conflicts of interest and
accepting gifts from companies doing business with the utility.
   Many of the prohibitions cover the sorts of troubles that began
surfacing when Douglas McCrary received an anonymous letter replete
with allegations after he became Gulf's president in 1983.
   McCrary brought in a pair of investigators.
   Top executives reimbursed the company for using certain materials
and services for personal purposes, although insisting most had been
normal perquisites.
   Last year, two former Gulf managers were convicted of tax fraud
and a Pensacola businessman was convicted of perjury in kickback
schemes. They allegedly stole more than $80,000 by billing Gulf for
materials never delivered.
   Little attention was paid to Gulf outside the Florida Panhandle
until almost a year ago, when a federal grand jury began probing the
financial practices of its Atlanta-based parent, Southern Co.
   On April 10, 1988, Gulf became a focus of national attention when
its senior vice president, Jacob Horton, and two Southern pilots
died in a plane crash four minutes after taking off from Pensacola's
airport.
   The cause of the crash remains a mystery, but just hours before
the crash Horton was told the audit committee had recommended that
he be fired because of accounting irregularities.
   An investigative report submitted to the committee indicated
Internal Revenue Service agents had targeted Horton, Southern
President Edward Addison, former Southern President Alvin Vogtle and
state Sen. W.D. Childers, D-Pensacola, a close friend of Horton.
   The bizarre happenings continued when lawyer Fred Levin, who met
with Horton the day he died, claimed four dead canaries with their
necks broken were left outside his office and homes, apparently as
warnings against ``singing'' to authorities.
   Although the full scope of the investigations has yet to be
disclosed, Gulf officials say they have taken steps to tighten the
utility's purchasing, contracting and warehousing operations. They
also have suspended an informal political fund-raising organization
and encouraged employees to anonymously report alleged wrongdoing.
   ``A vendor can no longer do business with Gulf Power Co. unless
they have a contract with the company,'' said Gulf spokesman Carter
Haynes. ``Used to, if there was something I needed at an office
supply store ... I could pick up supplies and they could bill us.''
   McCrary also has sent a letter to vendors urging them to let him
know if employees have tried to coerce them into making political
contributions because that is against company policy and no longer
tolerated, Haynes said.
   The report to the audit committee alleged Horton had arranged for
the utility to reimburse a supplier for a $1,000 campaign donation.
Current and former employees have complained they felt pressured
into making contributions through Gulf's official political action
committee.
   The Atlanta grand jury has subpoenaed campaign finance records of
32 state, local and federal candidates in Florida, including those
of Sen. Bob Graham, former Gov. Reubin Askew and former Sen. Paula
Hawkins. A subpoena is not an indication of any wrongdoing.
   Contracts for legal and other professional services now are more
detailed and can be approved only by McCrary, Haynes said.
   A mid-managment official had approved contracts with Ray Howell,
a graphic designer paid $1.2 million by the utility from 1980
through last year.
   Howell flew to Atlanta to testify before the grand jury Dec. 7,
but never appeared. He turned up two days later in the office of a
Missouri lawyer to sign over his interest in their Pensacola home to
his ex-wife. He was never seen again.

<HEAD>SEC's NY Regional Office is Moving July 21</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The people who helped bring down Ivan F. Boesky
are moving up _ two floors _ and over about seven blocks.
   The New York regional office of the Securities and Exchange
Commission will be trading its longtime base at 26 Federal Plaza in
lower Manhattan for new quarters near the World Trade Center later
this month.
   After more than 20 years at the aging, 42-story government office
building that also houses the FBI, Immigration and Naturalization
Service and some 80 other federal agencies near the city's courts
and municipal buildings, the SEC local staff is moving into private
office space closer to the financial district it regulates.
   The agency will exchange the slighty shabby federal building with
its beige walls and balky elevators for two entire floors atop 75
Park Place, a sleek, glass and metal, 13-story office building that
opened less than two years ago.
   The New York office, biggest of the SEC's nine regional offices,
will be expanding its office space from 34,000 square feet to 40,000
square feet, according to Renee Miscione, a spokeswoman for the
General Services Administration, which administers federal office
buildings.
   Other tenants in the new location include the publisher R.R.
Donnelly &amp; Sons and the legal department of the city's housing
authority.
   While SEC Regional Administrator Lawrence Iason and his staff of
about 200 are happy about the move, they also don't have much choice.
   The 850 staffers of the federal Environmental Protection Agency,
who already occupy parts of 12 floors at 26 Federal Plaza, need more
space and the SEC's offices fit the bill.
   ``But it's not like (the move) isn't beneficial,'' Dorothy Heyl,
regional counsel for the SEC in New York, said during a recent
interview as she tried to find room for storing 100 office chairs
that arrived three weeks early.
   The public reference room, where company filings and other SEC
documents are made available, will be expanded slightly, said Iason.

<HEAD>Texas Oilman: Japan Blocking Open Access To Markets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. says a ``stiff
arm'' from a Japanese company that rejected his bid for three board
seats shows that Japan is blocking foreign access to its financial
markets.
   ``I believe my experience symbolizes, in many ways, U.S.-Japanese
trade relations on a much broader scale,'' Pickens wrote in a
bylined, front-page article in Sunday's Dallas Times Herald. ``It
certainly underscores that the U.S.-Japan trade relationship is not
a two-way street.''
   ``The fact is that Japan Inc. does not want an outsider observing
its system from the inside,'' he added. ``And apparently it will do
anything _ even if it defies common sense _ to prevent open access
to Japan's financial markets.''
   Koito Manufacturing Co. last week rejected the Amarillo oilman's
bid for seats on its board of directors. Pickens' Boone Co. is the
largest shareholder in the Tokyo-based company, with 20.2 percent of
stock.
   Koito's second-largest shareholder, Toyota Motor Corp. _ viewed
as the real power behind Koito _ has placed three directors on the
company's board.
   Pickens wrote that he went to Tokyo to press for shareholder
rights and ``was given a stiff arm.''He said he wasn't surprised,
though, because the Koito board in April rejected his request for
representation.
   Boone Co.'s acquisition of its stake from a well-known Japanese
raider, Kitaro Watanabe, may have raised Koito's suspicion of
Pickens. But Pickens said the company shouldn't be wary of him.
   ``Common sense dictates that Boone Co., Koito's largest
shareholder, should also be entitled to three seats,'' he wrote.
``But common sense is not having the upper hand in this whole affair
_ or, for that matter, in much of present-day corporate Japan.''
   Pickens compared Japan's corporate climate to American business
100 years ago, a time of huge cartels.
   ``At the turn of the century, we began to break up those trusts
and open our markets to everyone who wished to participate,'' he
wrote. ``The trust-busting unleashed America's entrepreneurs and
proved to be a great boon to the country.''
   Pickens also said that Japan must open its economy or face a
decline in prosperity.
   ``While the Japanese people have done remarkably well in recent
times, if they do not make serious attempts to open their closed
economy, their continued economic prosperity will undoubtedly suffer
_ if not of stagnation from within, perhaps of retaliation from
without,'' he said.

<HEAD>Continental Offers $76 One-Way Fare After Holiday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines on Sunday announced $76
one-way fares on U.S. flights for three days following the Fourth of
July holiday. United Airlines said it would match the offer.
   Continental's fare will be offered on all mainland U.S. flights
where seats are available for trips beginning Thursday, Friday or
Saturday, the airline said in a statement.
   Continental said the deal was prompted by anticipated light
business travel because the July 4 holiday Tuesday falls near the
middle of a week.
   United spokesman Joseph Hopkins said the Chicago-based carrier
will match the Continental fare in all competitive markets. United's
commuter airline, United Express, is exempt from the deal, he said.
   Continental's sale fare requires no advance purchase, but tickets
must be bought within 24 hours of making a reservation. Travelers
may return as early as next Sunday or stay longer.
   Continental said in most markets the fare is the lowest offered
in years.
   The airline's lowest advance-purchase fare from Denver to Newark,
N.J., currently is $149, compared to the new $76 fare. Other low
advance-purchase one-way fares are $179 from Miami to San Francisco;
$149 from Houston to Boston; and $169 from Seattle to Atlanta.
   Tickets are nonrefundable and seats limited, Continental said.
The carrier estimated that more than 200,000 seats on its mainland
U.S. system are available for trips starting on the three days.
   Continental has about 1,400 daily departures between 82 U.S.
cities.

portrait in City Hall. And, unlikely as it seems, a Bolger beach
amid the cornfields. But the name doesn't belong to a founding

showing through the first half of 1989 by the auto, steel and other

economy's vicissitudes.
