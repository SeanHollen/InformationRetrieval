<HEAD>State Department Says Elections Best Solution to Khmer Rouge</HEAD>

   The best way to prevent a resurgence of power
by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia is to hold free elections and let
the Cambodian people reject the faction, the State Department said
Friday.
   But the department's statement did not rule out a role in an
interim coalition government for the Khmer Rouge, under whose
former rule international human rights groups estimate one-fourth
of Cambodia's 8 million people died from famine or execution.
   Fear of a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of
three insurgent groups in a Cambodian resistance coalition led by
U.S.-backed Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has been a major stumbling
block to a negotiated settlement with the Vietnamese-installed
government.
   Sihanouk is scheduled to meet with Hun Sen, the Vietnam-backed
Cambodian leader, on May 2 in Jakarta, Indonesia..
   The State Department comments followed Vietnam's announcement
this week that it would pull its remaining troops out of Cambodia
by the end of September, ending an 11-year occupation that ousted
the communist Khmer Rouge from power.
   ``The United States totally opposes a return to dominance by the
Khmer Rouge,'' the statement said.
   The United States envisions an arrangement in Cambodia in which
an interim coalition government is headed by Sihanouk, ``the
logical leader of such an arrangement,'' the statement said.
   ``Whether the Khmer Rouge, minus Pol Pot and the other
discredited Khmer Rouge leaders who clearly must be excluded, are
permitted to participate in such an interim arrangement is
something the Cambodian factions themselves will have to decide,''
the department said.
   ``We are convinced that in free and fair elections'' for a
permanent government, ``the Cambodian people would reject the Khmer
Rouge,'' it said.
   Any future arrangements for a return to democracy in Cambodia
would also have to include ``effective guarantees'' to prevent
power from falling into the hands of the Khmer Rouge, the
department said.
   U.S. officials say such safeguards would include an
international force to monitor the Vietnamese pullout, a halt to
outside supply of arms to the Cambodian factions and improved
international access to the Khmer Rouge camps along the
Thai-Cambodian border.
   International human rights groups and U.S. officials have
accused the faction of committing atrocities against prisoners
taken to those camps.
   The U.S. view has concerned some Asian countries who reject any
role for the Khmer Rouge, even an interim one, but U.S. officials
say the group is a fact of life and has too much power in the
resistance coalition to be ignored.
   China announced this week that it would continue arming the
Khmer Rouge until Vietnam makes good on its promise to pull out its
troops, estimated to number 50,000 to 70,000.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, called Friday for the Bush
administration to send military aid to the forces backing Sihanouk
and one of his allies, Son Sann.
   The United States should do ``everything it can'' to support the
resistance against the Khmer Rouge, said Solarz, who just returned
from discussions in China and Thailand on the situation in Cambodia.
   He proposed that the United Nations establish an interim
government in Cambodia to set up a political settlement through
elections.

<HEAD>Attorney General Calls for DNA Analysis of Criminals for Crime Solving</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Criminals convicted of violent crimes would
have their blood drawn for ``genetic fingerprinting'' to help solve
future crimes, under legislation endorsed Friday by state Attorney
General John Van de Kamp.
   Analysis of the unique genetic blueprint can be a powerful tool
for investigating and prosecuting violent crime, Van de Kamp said
Friday in support of legislation proposed by state Sen. Gary K.
Hart.
   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the chromosomes of
cells, including saliva, hair, blood, semen, tissue and bone
marrow. Only identical twins can have the same DNA pattern, or
genetic blueprint.
   Under the bill, blood samples already required of sex criminals
would be taken also from people convicted of murder, assault or
battery. DNA analysis of the samples would be stored in a
computerized data base available to police.
   The information could link a suspect to a crime in which tissue
is left behind. Rape investigations, in particular, would benefit
from the system, Van de Kamp said.
   The state of Virginia will begin providing DNA testing for its
police and sheriff's departments on May 1.

<TEXT>
   JUDGE GESELL: Well, now, colonel, that would require going to
the president, wouldn't it? ... Did you understand you had the
power to assert executive privilege for the president?
   NORTH: It was my understanding, sir, that executive privilege
could be exerted.
   JUDGE GESELL: By the president?
   NORTH: Well, by the office of the presidency, yes, sir.
   (There followed an exchange describing concerns by North about
the response to Congress suggested by McFarlane, including concern
about the disclosure of clandestine ammunition shipments to the
Contras.)
   NORTH: I was disturbed that the answer he was going to give,
given what the press was saying, the media was out there reporting
in volumes on what was going on down in Central America, and all
this was going to do was add, you know, fuel to the fire. It was
like throwing gasoline on the fire. In fact, it ended up that way.
... My point was, this answer that you (McFarlane) are proposing is
not going to help us. It is not going to help get the job done. It
is not going to help get aid to the resistance. It is just going to
make things worse.
   SULLIVAN: Did Mr. McFarlane reject your advice then with respect
to the draft that he had made?
   NORTH: Yes, sir, he did.
   JUDGE GESELL: What did he say, colonel?
   NORTH: My recollection is, sir, that he said that he had talked
with the president about the approach we were taking on the letters
and that my approach was far too confrontational. ...
   SULLIVAN: Congressman Barnes received a response to his letter
at about the same time, didn't he?
   NORTH: Yes, sir. ...
   SULLIVAN: Was ... Congressman Barnes' letter ... similar to the
Hamilton letter?
   NORTH: Yes, sir, it is.
   (North refers to several additional inquiries from Barnes and
Hamilton and that McFarlane briefed the congressman.)
   SULLIVAN: Now, after then, in order, two letters _ these letters
had been sent by Mr. McFarlane, two to Hamilton, one to Barnes?
   NORTH: Right.
   SULLIVAN: He (McFarlane) had been up to Capitol Hill twice?
   NORTH: Yes. ... There was a fairly steady flow of paper from Mr.
Barnes asking for documents, yes, sir.
   SULLIVAN: What are you telling Mr. McFarlane that he should do
with respect to Barnes' further inquiry ... ?
   NORTH: What I said was that I had attached a letter from Mr.
McFarlane back to Congressman Barnes in response to his request for
documents. ... (I) told Mr. McFarlane to remind Mr. Barnes that the
classified letter he had sent earlier had been revealed to the
media.
   SULLIVAN: ... Is this your draft that you recommended McFarlane
send to Barnes? (in response to the inquiries.)
   NORTH: Yes, sir, it is.
   SULLIVAN: Does your draft give Barnes what he wants or what he
is asking for?
   NORTH: No, sir, it does not.
   SULLIVAN: Does it take a hard line position saying, in essence,
that the information should not be given?
   NORTH: Yes, sir, it takes the approach of executive privilege.
...
   SULLIVAN: In essence, you are telling him we are not going to
give you documents?
   NORTH: We are not going to give you documents and here is why.
   (North says his draft letter was never sent.)
   SULLIVAN: So that you never did get your way in recommending
that the executive branch simply say to Congress, we have a right
not to provide information?
   NORTH: No, sir, I didn't. ... He (McFarlane) did call me over to
his office and showed me this stack of documents, which I at that
point did not realize was sitting over in his office. I know I was
surprised that they were there but not shocked. I mean, they were
his documents.
   SULLIVAN: Tell the jury what happened in that meeting with
regard to these documents.
   NORTH: Mr. McFarlane showed me the pile of documents and said,
there are several in here that are _ my recollection of the word is
problematical, that this handful, and he had pulled out several,
are a problem and they are inconsistent with what we have said to
the Congress. And certainly they were. I think he handed them to me
and I looked at them. And they were documents that clearly showed
what I had been doing at his direction in Central America. ... And
he said, these need to be fixed. In fact, he handed me a list that
had those documents on it and, as I recall, also cited several
others that I wrote down on the back of that list. He gave me that
list and said, fix these documents so that they are consistent with
what we have basically told the Congress.
   SULLIVAN: Did you explain to him right there at the time that it
didn't make sense to change any documents because the files were
filled with similar documents?
   NORTH: Yes, I did.
   SULLIVAN: What was his response to that?
   NORTH: He just told me to fix the documents and I mean, what's
important, those were his documents. I had written them all. But
they were his documents.
   SULLIVAN: What happened to the request that he made to change
documents? Did it just sit there?
   NORTH: Basically it did. ...
   SULLIVAN: So why didn't you do what he said?
   NORTH: Because I just didn't _ I didn't think it made any sense.
(A year later when North was about to be dismissed, he said he
altered the document.)
   SULLIVAN: That was in November 1986?
   NORTH: Yes, sir.
   SULLIVAN: Did you believe it was unlawful to do that?
   NORTH: No, I had written those documents. I had prepared them
for him. They were his documents. It never occurred to me that that
could be unlawful.

   Thirteen prisoners broke out of the Norfolk
County House of Corrections sometime Friday evening, state police
said.
   State and local police and sheriff's deputies using helicopters
and dogs converged on the area to begin a search.
   State police Sgt. Peter Quinn said the inmates were discovered
missing during a 9:30 p.m. head count and may have escaped around 8
p.m. He said the inmates are believed to have escaped by cutting
through a jailhouse wall.
   Dedham jail officials would only confirm that there had been a
jailbreak and repeatedly hung up when asked further questions.
   State police said that the inmates were clad in green prison
garb.
   WNEV-TV also reported that the inmates may be headed for Boston
and may have split up into small groups, making it more difficult
for authorities to track them down.
   The Dedham jail is one of the most overcrowded prisons in the
state. It was the scene of a disturbance on Feb. 8 when a fight
broke out in the recreation room.

<HEAD>President Puts Government in Control of Alaskan Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he wants ``complete
restoration'' of Alaska's oil-fouled Prince William Sound and is
sending in federal troops and inviting an army of volunteers to
help clean up the massive pollution.
   ``The job of cleaning up the oil from both the sea and the
affected land areas will be massive, prolonged and frustrating,''
Bush said Friday as he put the government in virtual control of the
operation.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, tapped to mobilize
and coordinate federal efforts, said ``the resources of the United
States government have been put at my disposal'' to ensure that the
area is returned to its pristine condition ``and I plan to use
them.''
   Administration sources, declining to be identified, said
thousands of military personnel would be involved.
   Bush announced his decision at a hurriedly called news
conference where he doggedly refused to answer questions about his
role in the Reagan administration's secret program to aid the
Contra rebels.
   He said any comment could prejudice the trial of one-time White
House aide Oliver North, at which new details of Bush's role
emerged Thursday.
   Bush told a questioner, ``The legal process ought to run
unfettered, without you or me endangering the trial process.''
   Turning to foreign policy, Bush said the situation in the Middle
East was slightly improved because of a proposal by Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to hold elections among Palestinian Arabs
in the West Bank and Gaza.
   ``In the Middle East, a little step sometimes can be fruitful,''
he said. ``I think the climate is better than it has been.''
   On other subjects, Bush said:
   _``I have no intention of budging one inch'' on Democratic
attempts to get him to raise his minimum-wage proposal above $4.25
an hour, coupled with a six-month subminimum ``training wage.'' The
House has passed a bill to raise the minimum wage to $4.55.
   _He will not be prodded by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to speed up a foreign policy review and return to strategic arms
talks. ``We're making a prudent review and I will be ready to
discuss that with the Soviets when we are ready,'' Bush said.
   _Developments in Poland were encouraging and represented a
``mind-boggling'' shift in the attitude of the communist
government. The Warsaw government this week approved a sweeping
agreement for democratic changes and legalizing the once-banned
Solidarity trade union.
   Opening the news conference, Bush branded the 10-million gallon
oil spill in Alaska a ``tragic environmental disaster'' and said it
had produced ``deadly results for wildlife and hardship for local
citizens.''
   He said, ``our ultimate goal must be the complete restoration of
the ecology and the economy of Prince William Sound, including all
of its fish, marine mammals, birds and other wildlife.''
   Bush noted that Exxon had acknowledged responsibility and
liability for the spill. Bush said Exxon ``should remain
responsible for both damages and for employing civilian personnel
necessary to control further damage.
   ``However, Exxon's efforts, standing alone, are not enough.''
   He said the federal effort ``should not in any way relieve Exxon
from any of its responsibilities or liabilities.''
   Bush said the military would provide personnel and equipment for
direct cleanup activities as well as logistical support. Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said the military could beef up the Valdez
airport to a 24-hour-a-day operation and provide housing and food
for cleanup personnel.
   Bush said he hoped facilities would be ready by summer to
accommodate a corps of volunteers.
   Skinner said the volunteers might be mobilized later this spring
to help clean up oil-fouled coastlines and wildlife on the dozens
of islands affected by the spill.
   Bush emphasized that ``we are not federalizing'' the cleanup.
Skinner explained that the administration was not using the word
``federalization'' because of ``some legal connotations'' _
apparently dealing with liability for the spill and cleanup.

   A sex survey designed to help stem the spread
of the deadly AIDS virus must be revised to ensure the government
does not pry needlessly into the personal lives of Americans,
Health Secretary Louis Sullivan has ordered.
   Heeding the advice of budget director Richard Darman, Sullivan
on Friday ordered the Public Health Service to conduct a ``thorough
review and revision'' of the survey so that it is scientifically
sound and ``sensitive and appropriate to the proper role of
government.''
   Darman had been pressured to act against the survey by a few
conservative Republicans in Congress who have organized
letter-writing and telephone campaigns expressing outrage at the
survey proposal.
   Paul Mero, a spokesman for Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.,
who has been rallying opposition to the survey, said, ``We hope
Secretary Sullivan will take it (Darman's concerns) to heart and
put this thing out to pasture where it belongs.''
   He said that when the revisions are completed, he will conduct
``a final, personal review.''
   Sullivan said he recognizes the survey is needed to help health
experts better understand Americans' sexual behavior so they can
improve strategies to stem the sexually-transmitted AIDS virus. But
the survey should ``gather only data which is essential to public
health needs,'' he said.
   ``My initial review of the survey instrument does indicate to me
potential problems with the tone and content of the questions,'' he
said, noting it was prepared before he took over at the Department
of Health and Human Services in March.
   Sullivan acted after receiving criticism from Darman in a letter
Thursday in which he said: ``I have a great deal of difficulty
understanding how many of the questions are related to essential
public interests.''
   The Office of Management and Budget, which Darman heads, must
approve all government surveys as part of the Paperwork Reduction
Act, but only for purposes of reducing burdensome federal paperwork.
   Citing that law, Darman told Sullivan in the letter that OMB
officials do not ``have the authority at this point to stop the
proposed study.''
   The proposed project includes a pilot survey of 2,300 Americans
to learn the intimate details of their sexual lives, including when
they last had sex, what they did and whether their partner was a
man or woman. Other questions asked about such things as
masturbation, oral sex and anal sex. A subsequent survey, at an
estimated cost of $15 million, would question 20,000 people.
   The department said the survey is intended to produce a
comprehensive picture of Americans' sexual behavior to help health
experts better plan strategies to fight the spread of the deadly
AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases.
   Darman said he recognized that need, ``but, as important as it
is, that is a considerably narrower subject than the more general
subject of sexual mores, preferences and behavior patterns in
American society.''
   ``While I in no way question the rights of private researchers
to explore this subject, I do question the extent to which it may
be appropriate for the public sector to subsidize such research,''
the budget chief said.

   Activists were thronging to the nation's
capital today for a demonstration that organizers hope will cement
public opinion once and for all in favor of a woman's right to an
abortion.
   March leaders say the demonstration on Sunday will launch a
campaign that includes nationwide distribution of a videotape aimed
at countering the anti-abortion movement's trademark video,
``Silent Scream.''
   The 20-minute videotape ``Abortion: For Survival'' includes
footage of a woman undergoing an abortion to show the procedure is
``safe and simple'' and the indiscernible remains taken from the
uterus in a first-trimester abortion.
   The videotape ``puts it where it's at,'' said Eleanor Smeal,
president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. ``It talks about
abortion as a public health necessity and essential for the
well-being of millions of American women.
   ``It features the central issue of this debate: What is
abortion, why it's needed and why the public health and medical
establishment of our society and worldwide is for keeping it
legal.''
   The tape is being distributed to government officials and
members of Congress and state legislatures as well as on college
campuses nationwide, she said.
   ``Silent Scream'' expresses the anti-abortion view by depicting
a fetus being aborted.
   March organizers said other parts of their campaign include
applying pressure on government agencies and pharmaceutical
companies to improve available contraception and standing up to
Operation Rescue's attempts to close down abortion clinics.
   The march is aimed at women's rights in general and a pending
Supreme Court decision that could reverse its 1973 landmark ruling,
Roe vs. Wade, which legalized abortion. Oral arguments in the new
case are scheduled for April 26.
   President Bush told anti-abortion activists a few days after he
moved into the Oval Office that he wanted the decision overturned.
   Bush faced White House reporters on Friday but was not asked
about the march or his views on abortion at a news conference that
covered issues ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to the minimum
wage, the Alaska oil spill to foreign policy in the Middle East and
the Soviet Union.
   March organizers said students were coming from about 500
college campuses, many of them in the Northeast, where many college
students are within easy traveling distance of Washington.
   Other delegations of students as well as activists representing
churches, labor unions and other groups across the country are
coming. Dozens of celebrities are also scheduled to appear.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said she expected the size of the demonstration will be ``easily
double ... and probably (be) considerably'' larger than the
Washington march three years ago which drew a crowd police
estimated at 90,000.
   A counterdemonstration by anti-abortion advocates is expected to
draw about 300 people during Sunday's pro-choice march from the
Washington Monument down the Mall to the Capitol.

   The Bush administration wants House lawmakers
to begin slicing chunks of money off a fiscal 1989 spending bill
that has more than doubled in size in recent days.
   Figures gathered Friday showed that after a week of work by the
subcommittees of the House Appropriations Committee, a measure
proposed by President Bush for $2.2 billion in new spending this
year has grown to $4.6 billion.
   Richard Darman, director of the White House Office of Management
and Budget, sent a letter Thursday to Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass.,
ranking Republican on the appropriations panel, warning the
lawmakers that because of the added expenditures, he would urge
Bush to veto the bill.
   Darman noted that under a 1987 budget summit agreement between
then-President Reagan and congressional leaders, additional
spending for this year could be allowed only in case of a ``dire
emergency.''
   ``In action taken this week, we believe several of the House
Appropriations subcommittees have adopted items that are a clear
violation of the summit agreement,'' Darman wrote.
   Conte said in an interview that he agreed that the extra
spending should not be on the bill.
   ``They're not going to get anywhere with this,'' he said,
referring to House Democrats who are pushing the more generous
version of the spending measure.
   The new spending appended by the lawmakers includes $726 million
for anti-drug efforts, including money for prisons, police officers
and prevention programs; $256 million to pay reparations to
Japanese-Americans interned during World War II; and $350 million
on top of a $250 million request by Bush to pay the costs of
fighting last year's western forest fires.
   The subcommittees also ignored a 1.1 percent across-the-board
slash that Bush had proposed in many domestic programs.
   That cut would have saved $829 million, but was attacked by
critics for deriving one-third of its savings from programs for the
poor.
   The deficit for fiscal 1989 _ which ends Sept. 30 _ was recently
projected by OMB at $170.2 billion, excluding this bill. The budget
resolution passed by Congress last spring called for a 1989 deficit
of $142 billion. For technical reasons, the total for new spending
in a bill frequently differs from the impact the measure will have
on the government's red ink.
   Among other expenditures added to the bill by the subcommittees
were $96 million for the Customs Service and other Justice
Department law enforcement agencies plus $36 million for
drug-testing and other anti-drug efforts by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   In addition, the lawmakers inserted $35 million for the FAA to
hire more security officers, safety inspectors and air traffic
controllers; $35 million for the prosecution of savings and loan
fraud cases; and $32 million for improvements in weather
forecasting equipment and for other National Weather Service
expenses.
   Bush's bill had included $892 million for the guaranteed student
loan program for college students; $850 million for cost-of-living
increases in veterans' benefits and other Department of Veterans
Affairs programs; $423 million for foster care and adoption
programs; $100 million for the costs of increased immigration from
the Soviet Union, Southeast Asia and Africa; and $55 million for
the government's uranium program.
   The full appropriations committee is expected to consider the
bill no earlier than the week of April 18. The Senate has yet to
work on the measure.

   Senate Democrats and the White House will
clash directly for the first time next week over raising the $3.35
hourly minimum wage, with more skirmishes expected before the
nation's 5 million lowest paid workers get an increase.
   Leaders of both parties in the Senate agreed Friday to hold
back-to-back votes Tuesday _ the first on the latest Democratic
version for annual increases of 40 cents an hour to $4.55 by
October 1991, and the second on Bush's offer of yearly 30-cent
boosts to $4.25 by January 1992.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole conceded his party and Bush are
likely to lose both votes. But Dole expressed confidence of a
victory when the president vetoes the measure, as he promised again
Friday, and Democrats attempt to override the veto.
   The chief sponsor of the raise, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
acknowledged he lacks the 16 additional votes needed to muster a
two-thirds majority for overriding a presidential veto.
   ``I would hope they don't again lay down this line in the
sand,'' Kennedy said, challenging the administration's insistence
on no more compromises. ``They've come a long way, we've come a
long way.''
   Democrats on Friday subtracted a dime from the $4.65 federal
floor on wages they had wanted, and they accepted for the first
time a 60-day subminimum ``training wage'' for workers entering
their first job.
   Bush, however, told reporters he had ``no intention of budging
one inch'' on allowing a minimum wage that high or on accepting
that short a period during which employers could pay a ``training
wage'' 20 percent below the federal floor.
   ``I will veto any bill which exceeds a $4.25 wage level and
which does not contain a six-month training wage for new hires,''
he said in a letter Friday to Dole.
   The latest Democratic plan was put together by Kennedy and Sens.
Bob Graham of Florida and David Pryor of Arkansas. Except for minor
differences on the subminimum scale, it is identical to a bill
passed by the House last month.
   In the House version, an employer could pay the lower subminimum
skill only to workers in their first job. The Senate measure would
require a worker to have at least 60 days' experience in one or
more jobs before any employer would have to pay the higher scale.
   Bush's subminimum would allow employers to continue paying $3.35
to any new hires, regardless of their previous experience, for six
months. That subminimum would rise to $3.40 an hour in 1992 under
the president's proposal while the Democrats would do away with it
entirely then.

   The Soviet Union bugged the U.S. Consulate in
Leningrad, the State Department charged in a statement that called
the action reprehensible no matter how long ago the listening
devices were planted.
   The State Department said Friday the listening devices were
discovered in early February during an inspection by security
personnel.
   ``Such hostile attempts at intelligence gathering, however long
ago they may have been initiated, are deeply resented by the
American people,'' the department said it had told the Soviets in a
protest.
   The devices in the consulate, which was opened in 1973, were
discovered by officers from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the
statement said.
   According to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, the devices were implanted ``deep in the structure a
long time ago.'' He declined to provide further details.
   In 1985, the United States accused the Soviets of planting
listening devices in the new U.S. embassy chancery in Moscow. In
1987, a Marine guard, Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, was accused and
court-martialed on charges he permitted Soviet intelligence agents
to gain access to the U.S. embassy.
   The latest accusation of Soviet intrusion was unexpected. The
two governments were in the process of deciding whether to open new
consulates in Kiev and New York.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meanwhile, was in the
midst of deciding what to do about the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
   The two aides he sent there on an inspection trip returned two
weeks ago with a recommendation to salvage part of the chancery, an
administration official said Wednesday.
   The inspection was conducted by Nicholas M. Salgo, a former U.S.
ambassador to Hungary, and Ivan Selin, who has been nominated to be
undersecretary of state for management.
   They told Baker on their return that refurbishing the building
or even constructing an annex would be cheaper than razing the
chancery and starting over. The estimated cost of tearing down and
rebuilding the structure is $500 million.
   A trade group headed by Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of Archer
Daniels Midland Co., offered to buy the building for use as
business offices.
   Andreas is co-chairman of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic
Council, which promotes trade between the two superpowers. He made
the offer on behalf of a consortium of U.S. companies, which would
use the building as a Moscow headquarters.

   Six American software companies have
accused three Italian companies of pirating their programs in an
unprecedented copyright infringment lawsuit, company officials said
Friday.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Milan, Italy, accuses the
European companies of unauthorized copying of software produced by
Lotus Development Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. and Ashton-Tate Corp.
of Torrance, Calif.
   The Elettrocarbonium S.p.A., Montedison, S.p.A. and its
affiliate, Montefibre S.p.A. were named as co-defendants in the
lawsuit filed by the Business Software Association, a Washington,
D.C.-based industry group.
   The lawsuit did not specify what compensation the group was
seeking.
   BSA President Douglas E. Phillips said the group would likely
file additional lawsuits against several other companies in the
months to come.
   ``The level of unauthorized copying of software in Italy _ not
only by dealers but by organizational users _ is one of the most
egregious in Europe,'' Phillips said in a prepared statement.
   The breach had cost companies trying to develop and market
legitimate software hundreds of millions of dollars, Phillips said.
   Technical experts found evidence of widespread software
duplication during inspections ordered by the Italian courts and
conducted last week at two of the accused firms, Phillips said.
   He said more than 90 percent of the software inspected at
Montedison was reproduced without authorization and 80 percent of
the software inspected at Elettrocarbonium consisted of
unauthorized copies.
   Officials at the Milan-based Montedision and its affiliate have
denied the charges. BSA officials did not know whether
Elettrocarbonium had also denied the allegations.
   BSA was founded in 1988 to promote free and open trade in
legitimate business software while protecting intellectual property.
   The consortium's membership also includes Aldus Corp. of
Seattle, Autodesk Inc. of Sausalito, Calif., Microsoft Corp. of
Redmond, Wash. and WordPerfect Corp. of Orem, Utah.

<HEAD>Nurse Says School Ridiculed Her Weight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nurse has sued her former instructors
for allegedly ridiculing her weight and using her as an example of
how difficult it would be to care for an obese person.
   Sharon L. Russell, now a nurse at All Children's Hospital in St.
Petersburg, Fla., sued Salve Regina College and five faculty
members contending they violated an implied contract by refusing to
let her complete school, invaded her privacy and caused her
emotional distress.
   She is seeking unspecified damages.
   Russell was told in 1985 that she would not be allowed to return
for her senior year because she had failed to lose weight over the
summer.
   Russell testified in U.S. District Court Thursday that
instructor Barbara Dean once told her there was no uniform to fit
her and said, ``You'll never make it around the bed because you're
too big.''
   Another instructor, Sister Maureen Hines, on one occasion ``had
me get into bed to show (classmates) it's more difficult to make a
bed with an overweight person in it,'' Russell said. ``I was
embarrassed and humiliated.''
   The nun also once grabbed her arm and said how difficult it was
to give an injection through obese tissue, Russell testified.
   The nurse, who completed training at St. Joseph's College in
West Hartford, Conn., in 1987, also contends the school should pay
damages because she lost a year of prospective employment.
   Steven P. Snow, the college's lawyer, said in his opening
statement that the instructors ``knew better than she knew the
physical demands that are placed upon a nurse in our society.''
   Russell suffered from an eating disorder, was more than 200
pounds overweight and could not be fitted into a ``scrub gown,''
Snow said.
   He said the six unsatisfactory marks Russell received from her
clinical instructors in 1984 all were related to her weight, but
said she was ultimately given a passing grade in return for a
promise to go on a diet.
   ``Time and time again she broke that promise,'' he said.
   Russell was allowed to register for her senior year only on the
understanding she would diet during the summer, and she did not,
Snow said.
   Salve Regina, a private college in Newport, is administered by
the Roman Catholic Sisters of Mercy.

<HEAD>North Says Administration Officials Knew of Hawk Shipments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Administration officials knew at the time
about a November 1985 shipment of missiles to Iran, according to
Oliver North's defense.
   During his examination Friday of North, defense attorney Brendan
Sullivan brought out that top officials were given data from
intelligence intercepts tracking the 1985 shipment almost hourly.
   North, examining one of the intercepts, noted the exact minute a
plane touched down in Iran.
   North denied, however, that he falsely stated to Congress that
no one in the U.S. government learned before 1986 that Hawk
missiles had been shipped to Iran in November 1985.
   North testified that although he was at a meeting Nov. 20, 1986,
where congressional testimony was discussed, he played no part in
shaping prepared testimony.
   According to the evidence, those receiving summaries of such
intercepts included national security adviser Robert McFarlane or
North and CIA Director William Casey or his deputy. Also receiving
them were Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, and the chairman of
the joint chiefs of staff John Vessey and his deputy.
   Casey sat in on the Nov. 20, 1986, meeting which was intended to
prepare him and national security adviser John Poindexter for
congressional appearances on the Iran initiative the next day,
according to testimony.
   The CIA participants brought to the meeting a proposed insert
saying the spy agency had been told the shipment was oil drilling
equipment.
   The CIA had arranged, at North's request, to have one of its
airlines transport the Hawks in 1985, but did so without first
getting a presidential finding.
   North recalled that as the Iran-Contra affair unfolded in
November 1986, he spoke to his former boss, McFarlane, about the
shipment of Hawks.
   McFarlane said that it didn't happen, North said.
   ``You knew it happened?'' asked Sullivan.
   ``Yes sir,'' replied North. ``He called me up from Europe and
made it happen.''
   In testimony during North's trial, McFarlane had a different
recollection. McFarlane said North told him that ``he believed he
and I hadn't learned the precise details of what happened until''
12 months after the shipment.
   McFarlane said he doubted at the time of the 1986 conversation
that North was correct, but that his own memory of the 1985
shipment was hazy so that he couldn't contradict North.
   As a result, McFarlane said, he changed a chronology of the Iran
arms shipments, removing a reference to the November 1985 shipment
of Hawks and substituting instead a more general reference to other
transfers of equipment.

<TEXT>
   SULLIVAN: When you were having the discussions with Mr.
McFarlane back in August and September of 1985 as to how to answer
these congressmen, you were arguing to him that he should not
respond. Did it ever occur to you that his response was unlawful?
   NORTH: No ... in fact, ... it never occurred to me the letter
could be a violation of the law.
   SULLIVAN: Had you ever heard of a circumstance in which a letter
from a Cabinet officer to a congressman would be the basis for a
criminal charge?
   NORTH: No, these were political disputes. This was a political
battle the likes of which I guess Washington has a lot of them. It
was a nasty political dispute. It was politics at its worst but it
never occurred to me, I've never heard of it before or since until
this, that that kind of a thing could be unlawful. ... I mean my
argument (against responding to Barnes and Hamilton) wasn't based
on something being unlawful. My argument was based on the fact that
if there's ever a chance to use this kind of privilege, authority,
it ought to be used on this. ... it never occurred to me that it
was unlawful.
   SULLIVAN: The next thing that happens, let's go to June 1986.
What does the Congress do at that time with regard to a resolution
of inquiry? (The House resolution formally requested information on
North's activities.) What was the conclusion you drew (from this
resolution)?
   NORTH: Well, the conclusion I drew is this was just one more
chapter in this very bitter political dispute in which both sides
were pulling out all the stops. ... (Our response was) the fact
that we've answered these questions before, meaning Mr. McFarlane's
answers the year before. ...
   (North then discusses an informal meeting with Rep. Hamilton in
the White House situation room on Aug. 6, 1986.)
   SULLIVAN: What did that mean to you, informal? Off the record?
   NORTH: I guess my sense of it was that this was simply an effort
to stop the inquiries ....
   SULLIVAN: Did you ever think you would be in a courtroom some
day in 1989 being charged with a crime because of a meeting that
occurred on August 6th, 1986, which was off the record, informal?
   NORTH: No, sir.
   SULLIVAN: Did you tell them the truth at that meeting on August
6th, 1986?
   NORTH: No.
   SULLIVAN: When you didn't disclose information they were looking
at, did you believe that your conduct was unlawful?
   NORTH: No, I didn't think it was unlawful but I was raised to
know the difference between right and wrong. I knew it wasn't right
not to tell the truth on those things, but I didn't think it was
unlawful.
   SULLIVAN: How did you feel about being told by your boss to go
into a meeting on August 6th, 1986?
   NORTH: I felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by
giants. ... I had been told specifically that the Saudi aid that
the president had gotten and that Mr. McFarlane had gotten will
never be revealed. And by this time we were also using monies from
the sale of arms to the Nicaraguan resistance _ to the Iranians to
help the Nicaraguan resistance, and that would never be revealed.
   SULLIVAN: Was it your understanding that if you answered frankly
the questions that were asked in that session that it would lead to
being confronted with having to reveal some of those things?
   NORTH: Yes, and that's why I didn't think that that meeting was
a good idea.
   SULLIVAN: And did you tell Admiral Poindexter that?
   NORTH: I did.
   SULLIVAN: And what was his decision?
   NORTH: You can take care of it.
   (North describes exchanges in which his superior, Adm. John
Poindexter, McFarlane's successor as national security adviser,
discussed concerns that too many people were beginning to find out
what North is doing in Central America.)
   NORTH: He ... told me that I .... must generate a cover story;
just don't be letting people know where you are going, what you are
doing and why you are doing it. And so I did so.
   SULLIVAN: Now (Poindexter) speaks of ``operational roles'' ..
what did you understand it to mean?
   NORTH: Well, he specifically said to me, that goes for the
terrorism business, that goes for the hostage business, that goes
for all the reasons that you're doing with the resistance.

<HEAD>Animal Rights Supporters Say Bulls At Rodeo Will Be Exploited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ODESSA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Animal-rights activists say letting bulls
loose in an arena with rodeo clowns will exploit and mentally
torment the animals.
   ``It is morally, ethically and legally wrong to torment an
animal to the point where it's going to charge you,'' said Raini
Sequoya, president of the Tampa-based National Animal Rights Inc.
``If these clowns really want to have some fun, they should get in
the ring and torment each other. Why pick on a helpless animal?''
   But organizers of this weekend's Odessa Rodeo &amp; Yukon Days said
nothing is wrong with the crowd-pleasing event.
   ``I don't understand. Is waving a flag in a bull's face more
cruel than getting on his back and riding him?'' said organizer
John Burchell.
   Steve Fleming, spokesman for the Professional Rodeo Cowboy's
Association in Colorado, was taken aback by the criticism.
   ``This is great. ... A clown goes out and stands in the middle
of an arena and they let a bull out to chase him _ kind of like
turning a bulldog loose on a mailman _ and people are worried for
the bull,'' said Fleming.
   The event is for clowns to display their bravery and talent, he
said. The clowns have 70 seconds to show judges how they avoid
getting killed. They can't touch the bull or use weapons and have
only a barrel to crawl into.
   The activists had vowed to seek an injunction to stop the event
on the grounds that it breaks Florida's 88-year-old animal cruelty
law. But they had not done so by Friday, and were considering plans
to file legal action after the event.

<HEAD>Families Of Flight 103 Victims Lambast `Callousness' Of U.S. Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Her voice trembling with pain and then anger,
Eleanor Bright recalled her late husband and lambasted what she
called the callousness of U.S. officials following the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103.
   ``After suffering the unimaginable loss of my husband, I have
had to fight to get information. That's not right,'' said Mrs.
Bright, the mother of a 19-month-old son, echoing complaints from
other victims' family members.
   A Senate hearing room was hushed Friday, the only sound an
occasional muffled cry from other family members, as the
32-year-old widow from Brookline, Mass., told about the
difficulties of getting information from the State Department
following the Dec. 21 terrorist bombing over Scotland that claimed
270 victims.
   ``I call Washington, I call Scotland, and in anger and
frustration I call other victims,'' she told the Senate Foreign
Relations terrorism subcommittee.
   ``The stories never end,'' she said. ``Memorials unattended by
State Department officials. Someone told to come `pick up the
shipment' when her husband's body arrived from Scotland. Someone
else watched as the body of her loved one was lifted off a platform
using a forklift. One widow was told it was time to realize that
her husband was dead and get on with her life.''
   Mrs. Bright, unable to steady her voice, told a subcommittee
headed by John F. Kerry, D-Mass., of her own experiences _ how it
was nine hours after the accident before the airline called, how
the State Department did not call for days and how the only answers
at the accident scene in Lockerbie, Scotland, came from Scottish
officials.
   ``I learned through my husband's employer that Nicholas was
seated in seat 14A, directly over the bomb,'' she said. ``I need to
know what that meant. Was he ever aware of what was happening? Was
he ever afraid? Was he in pain?
   ``It was not until February that I learned by chance that an
autopsy had been performed on Nicholas. All of this information
should have given by the State Department or Pan Am, but it wasn't.
Why were they silent? Instead of me being allowed to grieve for the
loss of my husband, I was forced to seek out answers on my own.''
   ``As my husband so strongly believed, there is a right answer
and it's worth fighting for. The right answer is that we need a
responsive, informative and compassionate State Department,'' Mrs.
Bright said. ``It would not have taken a lot of manpower or dollars
to have dealt with this differently.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Joan M. Clark defended the
government's response, saying the State Department had planned to
contact next-of-kin, but Pan Am wanted to do it and the government
has ``no legal authority to compel an airline to give us a
passenger list.''
   ``Our objective was to spare (the families) as much anguish as
possible,'' she said. ``We refrained, however, from taking a more
active role with family members for fear of intruding unnecessarily
during that time of tragedy and shock.''
   But she conceded that the State Department has ``learned a great
deal from this experience'' and ``are reviewing our methods for
handling crises and are making appropriate changes.''
   She said the government is seeking an agreement with the major
airlines to coordinate emergency action plans. In addition, the
department has organized an 18-member special family liaison group
to provide one-on-one information for each family of the Flight 103
disaster and is considering an 800 telephone number in disaster
situations.
   Kerry joined the family members in calling for a new policy to
tell passengers about terrorist threats and to increase airport
security checks even if it means much longer waiting times for
passengers.
   Monte R. Belger, associate administrator at the Federal Aviation
Administration, said he believes new government regulations
mandating devices to detect plastic explosives and other changes
ordered in the wake of the Flight 103 disaster are sufficient.

   Powerful currents and a channel that's tough
to negotiate may have been partly to blame for the grounding of an
Exxon tanker on a sandbar in the Mississippi River, a Coast Guard
official said.
   The 617-foot Exxon Wilmington, carrying 13 million gallons of
oil products, got stuck Friday on the muddy bottom near the mouth
of the Mississippi River. Four tugboats freed it after seven hours.
No oil spilled from the ship.
   ``Where the river's at now, it's tricky down there,'' said Capt.
John Klotz of the Coast Guard's district headquarters.
   Klotz said the river is rising and currents are powerful where
the ship went aground _ a point where the main channel splits into
three smaller channels emptying into the Gulf of Mexico.
   He said the river is 38 to 39 feet deep there, though the Army
Corps of Engineers tries to maintain a 45-foot depth.
   Klotz, who inspected the grounded Exxon Wilmington from a
helicopter, said checks of the ship's double hull indicated it was
undamaged.
   The Wilmington steamed Friday night to an anchorage in the Gulf
of Mexico where Coast Guard inspectors were to give its hull a
final check for damage before letting it proceed to a refinery at
Bayway, N.J.
   The Coast Guard is investigating why the Wilmington ran aground.
   The ship was loaded with more than 8 million gallons of jet fuel
and nearly 5 million gallons of other petroleum products, mainly
paraffin. It took on the cargo at the Exxon refinery at Baton
Rouge, said Exxon spokesman John Reidy.
   It was the second Exxon tanker to run aground. On March 24, the
Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound and
spilled 10.1 million barrels of oil in the worst spill in U.S.
history.

<HEAD>Soviet Leader Ends Goodwill Tour By Inviting Queen To Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended a
six-day tour of Ireland, Cuba and Britain by announcing nuclear
cutbacks and inviting Queen Elizabeth II to visit Moscow.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday that the queen gave
``a very definite yes,'' but that no date had been set.
   She would be the first British sovereign to visit the Soviet
Union since the 1917 revolution. Her Russian ancestors _ the family
of Czar Nicholas II _ were slain by revolutionaries eight decades
ago.
   Gorbachev's invitation to the queen indicated his success in
winning Mrs. Thatcher's trust. In addition, televised pictures of
the Gorbachevs being escorted around Windsor Castle by the
63-year-old queen and her husband, Prince Philip, further warmed
the royalty-loving British to the Soviet leader.
   Despite the invitation and the cordiality, Mrs. Thatcher and
Gorbachev disagreed on issues of nuclear disarmament and the
balance of East-West forces in Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher, moreover, downplayed the importance of the Soviet
leader's promise to halt production of weapons-grade uranium and
shut down two more plutonium-producing reactors by the end of 1990.
   Nevertheless, she declared Gorbachev's third visit to Britain
``very successful, warm and friendly,'' echoing his assertion that
it had strengthened British-Soviet ties.
   The Gorbachevs' 40-hour British stay ended with a day steeped in
pageantry.
   The president gave an unusually brief, 27-minute speech in the
splendid setting of London's Guildhall, the 1,000-year-old seat of
city government filled with city leaders in wigs and robes.
   In remarks broadcast live in Britain and the United States,
Gorbachev called his proposals for cutting production of
radioactive material ``another major step toward the complete
cessation of production of fissionable materials for use in nuclear
weapons.''
   However, Mrs. Thatcher later ascribed little importance to the
moves, saying existing Soviet stockpiles would mean the cutbacks
``will have no effect in practice.'' A U.S. Defense Department
official said the weapons reactors could be started when the Soviet
military runs low.
   The Soviet step followed Gorbachev's December announcement to
the United Nations that the Soviet Union would soon cut 500,000
soldiers from its standing army and withdraw troops and tanks from
European and Chinese frontiers.
   Gorbachev lauded Britain for unilaterally eliminating chemical
weapons stocks. He said his country had built a facility for
destroying its own chemical weapons, and he would soon invite
British experts to inspect it.
   The president also said the West should drop plans to modernize
short-range nuclear missiles, but Mrs. Thatcher maintained a
nuclear deterrent was essential.
   After lunch at Windsor Castle, the Gorbachevs were driven to
London's Heathrow Airport, where they flew home to Moscow.

Cruise, but the 8-year-old girl with muscular dystrophy got to have
lunch with the popular actor instead.
   Jaimie's date with the co-star of the Academy Award-winning
movie ``Rain Man'' was arranged by Make-A-Wish Foundation, a
charity that grants wishes of children ages 2{ to 18 who have
life-threatening illnesses.
   When applying to Make-A-Wish, Jaimie's mother, Jacque Hogan,
wrote that Jaimie saw Cruise's ``Top Gun'' 20 times and
``Cocktail,'' her favorite movie, twice.
   Jaimie, her parents and a friend flew to Los Angeles at the end
of March to meet Cruise.
   ``She was real shy around him ... she hardly looked at him,''
Mrs. Hogan said. ``The kids couldn't think of a thing to ask him.''
   Cruise talked about his newest movie, ``Born on the Fourth of
July,'' about a paraplegic Vietnam veteran, she said.

   The director of ``Blaze,'' a movie about
the late Gov. Earl Long and stripper Blaze Starr, says the film
will treat a legendary portion of Louisiana history with ``great
tenderness and affection.''
   Ron Shelton, who directed ``Bull Durham,'' says the movie
``features two American legends who had their roots in Louisiana.''
   Starr, a stripper with whom Long had a scandalous affair 30
years ago, is serving as a consultant to the film, which stars Paul
Newman as the colorful governor in his waning days of office.
   The movie's script came from historical research and interviews
with people who knew Long during the late 1950s and early '60s,
when the governor created controversy by backing social welfare
programs and voter rights, Shelton said.
   The movie, which begins filming Monday, is scheduled for
Christmas release in New York City and Los Angeles and general
distribution in early 1990.

   Jesse Jackson warned a crowd that ``war
will not work'' as he dedicated the Berkeley Peace Wall, two
concrete slabs featuring painted ceramic tiles.
   The wall, two 4-foot-tall semicircular concrete arcs in a patio
at Martin Luther King Jr. Park, was the brainchild of local artist
Carolyn Marks, who calls it a ``basic human family quilt.''
   The tiles came from more than a dozen countries, including the
Soviet Union, and carry slogans and artwork aimed at promoting
peace. One read, ``Peace through learning about each other.''
Another said, ``Humanity is one.''
   Some 2,000 people, from preschoolers to one elderly woman
wearing a Gray Panthers button, gathered Friday under a bright blue
sky in unseasonably warm weather to view the wall.
   Jackson compared the peace wall to the wall that separates East
and West Berlin, saying: ``I look forward to the day when we can
put tiles on the wall in Berlin.
   ``Our generation must be intelligent enough to give peace a
chance,'' he said.

   Talk isn't cheap when it comes to baseball
announcer Bob Uecker, former Gov. Lee Dreyfus and NBC basketball
announcer Al McGuire, who have turned their silver tongues to gold
by speaking their pieces for a price.
   A newspaper study found the going rates are $25,000 for Uecker,
$7,000 for Dreyfus and $5,000 for McGuire.
   Uecker has little time for speaking these days, especially after
suffering a mild heart atack in February. But when he does have
time to squeeze in an appearance between taping his ``Mr.
Belvedere'' television show and broadcasting Milwaukee Brewers
games, his appearance fee puts him in the range of such celebrities
as talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.
   Dreyfus, a Republican, left the governor's officer six year ago
and his career as a lecturer has built steadily since then.
   McGuire, the former Marquette University coach, is especially in
demand in the Southeast, according to his assistant, Jeannine
McKeown. ``It's a basketball hotbed down there,'' she said.

has ended at 1,463.
   McCoy, the voice of the National Basketball Association,
contracted laryngitis after broadcasting Phoenix's 114-104 win over
Utah Wednesday night.
   He attended Thursday night's game at Seattle, but producer Greg
Schulte of radio station KTAR in Phoenix handled the play-by-play.
It was the first time in 17 years that McCoy did not do the

   The Grateful Dead concert scheduled tonight
will have beefed-up police presence because of violence at concerts
in Pittsburgh earlier this week.
   Thirty-three officers will be at Riverfront Coliseum, with 82
security officers and 60 ushers, said Dave Rager, the city's
assistant safety director.
   Most of the 16,144 tickets sold went to out-of-towners, with
almost 7,000 going to ``Dead Heads,'' as the group's ardent fans
are called. They often camp out at concerts and trade tapes and
souvenirs.
   Police in Pittsburgh arrested 55 people, mostly on public
intoxication and drug charges, at Grateful Dead concerts Sunday and
Monday. Pittsburgh police clashed Monday night with a crowd of more
than 500 who had surrounded the Civic Arena but did not have
concert tickets.

   (North resumes his testimony after a lunch break.)
   SULLIVAN: Would you read this letter. Is it a letter or the back
and front of a postcard of some sort? Do you recall?
   NORTH: This appears to be a copy of a card with the front and
back written on it, yes, sir.
   SULLIVAN: All right. Would you read that to the jury, please.
This is from Vice President Bush in November 1985.
   NORTH: It says, ``en route to Andrew's 11-29-85. Dear Ollie, as
I head off to Maine for Thanksgiving, I just want to wish you a
happy one with the hope that you get some well deserved rest. One
with the hope that you get some well deserved rest. One of the many
things I have to be thankful for is the way ... in which you have
performed under fire in tough situations.
   ``Your dedication and tireless work with the hostage thing and
with Central America really gives me cause for great pride in you,
and thanks. Get some turkey. George Bush.''
   SULLIVAN: That was received in November 1985 ... correct?
   NORTH: Yes, sir.
   SULLIVAN: Now ... would you explain to the jury, please, how it
is that you got involved in your office with trying to rescue
hostages?
   NORTH: The hostage problem was part of the overall program of
combating terrorism that the administration had, and it was a very
important element of it because we had an increasing number of
hostages being held. ... A consultant who was working for the NSC,
Mr. Ledeen ... had brought back from Israel information that they
thought that they could achieve an opening to Iran, to moderate
elements within the Iranian government, that there was great
polarization, great disarray in Iran, that the Israelis were fairly
sure of their information and had an agent working for them that
could put us in touch with them. And it involved the exchange of
certain Israeli weapons to Iran which could result in the release
of both Israeli hostages in Lebanon and the American hostages in
Lebanon.
   SULLIVAN: Colonel, would you explain why you are dealing with
the country of Iran if the hostages were in Lebanon?
   NORTH: Within Lebanon, there were several groups of Shia
fundamentalists, Moslem fundamentalists who had political loyalty
to the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. ... and so the Israelis, and we
agreed, though that if you could influence some of the more
moderate elements in Iran to cut them off financially, or to
convince them to turn loose the American hostages and the Jewish
hostages that were being held, along with some other europeans like
the French and Italians and British ...
   SULLIVAN: Were there missiles sent to Iran and did a hostage
come out as a result?
   NORTH: Yes, it did. (The hostage was Rev. Benjamin Weir) ...I
took, at the direction of the president, a letter from the
president to meet Mr. Weir, Reverend Weir; met with him; had a CIA
airplane take me to the meeting, in an effort to assure Reverend
Weir that his cooperation was necessary for us to be able to help
rescue the other _ or recover the other hostages.
   (North describes how he continued meeting with Israeli
intermediaries in an attempt to open up discussions with moderates
in Iran in an attempt to gain the release of U.S. hostages being
held in Lebanon.)
   NORTH: I went and talked to Mr. McFarlane about this in terms of
how far we were going on this initiative and what role we were to
play. And he told me simply that we were going to allow the
Israelis to proceed with this, that it was their initiative and
that we were to simply position the necessary people in the right
places to be able to safely recover the hostages and be prepared
for a high level meeting with the Iranians.
   SULLIVAN: Colonel, let's focus on the dates ... a little bit
here. September, '85, TOW missiles are shipped, is that correct?
   NORTH: I believe so, yes, sir. ...
   SULLIVAN: You were not involved in the earliest stages of that,
correct?
   NORTH: No, but at one point I did ask Mr. McFarlane if the
president approved it and he told me he had.
   (North describes a shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran through the
Israelis to get the hostages freed.)
   SULLIVAN: Were the transportation and logistical problems (with
the shipment) eventually worked out?
   NORTH: Yes, they were from purely the transportation problem.
But they weren't worked out as far as the Iranians were concerned.
... (the missiles) were eventually shipped and they did arrive in a
city in Iran, not Tehran, but another city, and it wasn't the full
80 that they had asked for. It was only 18, I believe.
   SULLIVAN: And was it anticipated that hostages would be released
as a result of this November, '85 Hawk shipment?
   NORTH: Yes, and we had gone to some lengths to position the
appropriate people to receive them. ... we had no operational role
in this other than to recover the hostages when they were released.
We weren't planning any of this. We were kind of responding to it.
   SULLIVAN: Now, Colonel, focusing your attention after the Hawk
shipment could you describe to the jury what problem arose after
the Hawks arrived in Iran? Did a hostage get out as anticipated?
   NORTH: On the November shipment, no. Apparently what the
Iranians had been told by the Israeli agent was something different
than what they expected. And they were to put it mildly very angry
over what was delivered in that November shipment. The November
shipment was 18 Hawk missiles and they had apparently expected
something entirely different. ... the Iranians ... came back to the
Israelis very, very upset about what had transpired and they said
that they'd been cheated and that therefore nobody was going to be
released, no Israelis, no Americans, no Europeans, nobody.

<HEAD>Major Streamlining of Nuclear Licensing Adopted by NRC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission hopes its
streamlining of the nuclear licensing process will keep the
industry alive by cutting the time needed to build a nuclear power
plant by roughly half.
   The new licensing procedures, approved by the five-member
commission without dissent on Friday, have been under development
for more than two years and have been the subject of hearings and
briefings.
   The commission staff, utility executives and other analysts have
said that there was no chance anyone would ever build another plant
without some licensing simplification, although there is no sign
that any utilities are close to seeking approval.
   The procedures try to resolve all major issues before a decision
on whether to go ahead with a plant. They provide for advance
approval of plant designs that could be used with little further
examination, and of sites that utilities could designate far in
advance of need.
   Also, the commission would go a long way toward the
much-discussed ``one-stop'' license, issuing a combined
construction permit and operating license.
   License applicants could still use the old procedure but the
commission does not expect anyone to do so.
   Site approval would be good for 20 years.
   Without new legislation, which the commission has been unable to
win, the procedure cannot be completely one-stop. Under current
law, the commission still will have to hold both a licensing
hearing and a hearing after a plant has been built before it can be
started.
   The new combined license would be issued only after safety and
site issues such as planning for emergency evacuations had been
resolved. The range of issues that could be raised at the second
hearing on whether license conditions had been met would be
narrowed, and Commission Chairman Lando Zech told reporters he did
not think legislation was necessary now.
   At the second hearing, issues would be limited to allegations of
``material and uncorrected non-conformance'' with license
conditions, or that ``adequate protection'' of the public is in
jeopardy.
   Failure of state and local governments to cooperate in emergency
planning has held up licensing of the completed Shoreham plant on
Long Island and the Seabrook plant on the New Hampshire coast.
   Under the new procedure, an applicant would have to show a
``good faith'' effort to win such cooperation in evacuation
planning and that the plan could work even without it.
   These issues are not even considered under the current procedure
until the plant is finished and the question before the commission
is whether to allow operation.
   Huge cost escalations, a drastic slowing of growth in
electricity demand in the past decade and fears generated by the
partial core melt of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in
1979 and other accidents combined years ago to kill new orders for
an industry that provides 18 percent of the nation's electricity.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Embassy confirmed that a
nuclear-powered submarine suffered an underwater accident and sank
in international waters off northern Norway, according to a radio
report Saturday.
   Defense Minister Johan Juergen Holst said on Norwegian Radio
that estimates of about 12 fatalities from the sinking Friday of
the Soviet ``Mike'' class submarine appeared accurate. Some crewmen
apparently were rescued, Holst said but he provided no details.
   A Norwegian Orion reconnaissance plane saw Soviet ships and
planes circling the accident site north of the Arctic Circle before
nightfall Friday. A second Orion passed over the area after
midnight and spotted an oil slick on the sea, Holst said.
   He said a Soviet cruiser was en route to the scene, and that
Norwegian vessels had made no attempts to approach the site, 118
miles south-southwest of Bear Island in the Norwegian Sea and 312
miles off Norway.
   Norwegian experts were meeting Saturday morning to discuss the
situation and keep the government informed about the possibility of
a radiation leak, the broadcast said.
   By Saturday, more than 12 hours after the accident, there was no
word on the accident from the Soviet government or the official
Tass news agency.
   The sea is 6,600 feet deep at the site of the sinking, and Holst
said there was ``no hope'' of raising the sub from the bottom.
Military officials in Norway and Washington said it appeared the
boat caught fire underwater before breaking up and sinking.
   The submarine, nicknamed ``Mike'' by the United States and NATO,
carries a crew of 95, is powered by two nuclear generators and is
reportedly equipped with torpedoes and long-range ballistic
missiles, Western sources say.
   The West German government radio also quoted Holst as saying
pilots of reconnaissance planes reported seeing bodies at the site.
   U.S. officials said there ``definitely'' were casualties aboard,
but declined to estimate how many.
   ``The only thing we saw was an oil slick about three to four
hundred meters long by 50 to 100 meters wide,'' Capt. Haavard Holm,
the Orion reconnaissance pilot, said on Norwegian Radio after
flying over the accident site.
   He said there were three Russian ships and one aircraft in the
area, including a trawler, a freezer ship and what appeared to be
an observation or intelligence vessel.
   Holst said he doubted the Soviets had sent the cruiser to keep
other ships away.
   ``They want to have as much support as possible and want to
transfer the survivors and the possible dead,'' he said.
   Defense Ministry officials said earlier that the reconnaissance
plane had seen Soviet planes and boats, including rubber dinghies
with people in at least one of them.
   It was not clear whether the people were from the submarine or
the surface vessels.
   ``With the observations we have made with the Soviet vessels and
planes in the area, it seems the Soviets can handle this case
alone,'' Holst said.
   The area is well above the Arctic Circle, but is usually
ice-free because of the Gulf Stream. Temperatures in the area were
near-freezing on Friday.
   The ``Mike'' is one of the Soviet Union's modern submarines, and
the only one in operation, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, the
British reference book.
   If Western descriptions of the submarine are accurate, ``the
reactors are well-protected and have less radioactive material than
in older submarines.'' said Johan Baarli, director of Norway's
Institute for Radiation Protection.
   He said on national radio that any radioactive material probably
would remain in the sub and not escape into the sea.
   Norwegian and Swedish defense sources estimate the Soviet Union
has about 110 nuclear submarines operating in northern waters from
bases on the Kola Peninsula, one of the world's heaviest
concentrations of naval power.
   The ``Mike'' might carry 16 missiles for surface targets,
although the figure is unconfirmed, said Swedish Defense Ministry
spokesman Thomas Gur.

<HEAD>Administration Prepares Massive Effort Against Drugs in Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration plans to construct a
new federal penitentiary in the Washington suburbs and a temporary
jail in the city to help fight the District of Columbia's drug and
violent crime problem.
   The New York Times and The Washington Post reported in their
editions today that national drug control policy director William
J. Bennett will announce his plans Monday.
   The reports, citing unidentified sources, said the plan will
call for National Guard troops to perform clerical jobs to free up
police officers, and an enhanced role for federal law enforcement
agents in the city's anti-drug efforts.
   Bennett's deputy chief of staff, David Tell, said late Friday
that he could not comment on the reports.
   Bennett has targeted the nation's capital, where an epidemic
drug-related killings have earned the city the title of ``murder
capital,'' in his national campaign against drugs.
   The Post reported that the wide-ranging federal effort will
include the use of forensic experts at the FBI to help reduce the
mounting backlog of unsolved homicide cases, and Drug Enforcement
Administration funds will be used to pay for police overtime.
   In addition, a DEA local task force will be expanded, with more
than a dozen supervisory DEA agents brought in to help local police
officials manage major drug cases, and five intelligence analysts
from the Defense Department will be detailed to help track drug
dealing.
   There have been 132 homicides, most of them drug-related, in the
district this year compared with 87 at the same time in 1988, when
the city had a record 372 murders.
   Among the plans outlined by the officials, according to the
newspapers, were these:
   _A new prison would be built to relieve overcrowding at a
6,000-inmate facility, the district-operated Lorton Reformatory
prison complex in suburban Virginia, beginning in fiscal year 1991.
   _About 200 to 300 prisoners would be transferred temporarily
from Lorton to federal prisons around the country. Such transfers
have occurred in the past because of the overcrowding.
   _A contingent from the U.S. Marshals Service would be assigned
to the city to make evictions in the estimated 200 to 300 crack
houses that thrive here, and to help the local police apprehend
suspects on outstanding warrants.
   _The Defense Department will use intelligence officials to
analyze international drug trafficking.
   _The DEA has agreed to assign about 15 officials temporarily to
Washington to double an existing task force that coordinates
efforts by regional police departments to pursue drug offenders.
   An administration official familiar with the plan told the Post
that Fort Meade, an Army post near Annapolis, Md., which houses the
National Security Agency and various military facilities, ``is one
of the options'' under study for the new federal penitentiary but
that no final decision has been made.

   Twenty years after they seized an
administration building in protest of the Establishment, former
student rebels gathered to show they may be older but they still
haven't sold out.
   Some of the more than 200 people who participated in the
takeover arrived Friday, sporting vintage anti-war buttons and worn
T-shirts.
   ``It was the end of writing letters to the editor and the
beginning of being really active,'' said Holly Cheever, 39, a
veterinarian and animal rights activist in Voorheesville, N.Y.
   ``I'm really proud of our generation,'' said Ms. Cheever, who
said she came to see old friends and remind herself that she
participated in a time that changed America.
   The two-day reunion included a kickoff rally where new student
activists joined the veterans in invoking anti-war sentiments as
well as raising questions about U.S. policy in Central America and
apartheid in South Africa.
   Also planned were a teach-in, debates and a party.
   The alumni were marking an event that began shortly after noon
April 9, 1969, when about 300 students seized University Hall,
Harvard's main administration building. They threw out nine deans
and locked the doors with chains, ignoring orders to leave.
   As dawn broke the following day, more than 400 state and local
police stormed the building at the request of then-Harvard
President Nathan Pusey.
   Some students were pulled out by their hair. About 45 people
were hurt, some after jumping from windows, and 197 were arrested.
   The brutality of the arrests and Harvard's willingness to use
police galvanized students. A three-day boycott of classes
stretched into a 15-day strike in which students virtually
commandeered the school.
   When the strike officially ended April 25, classes were over and
many exams canceled.
   School administrators had satisfied most of the protesters'
demands, including abolishing the campus Reserve Officers Training
Corps, setting up a department of African and Afro-American studies
and agreeing to build low-cost housing for people displaced by the
school's expansion projects.
   ``What happened in 1969 revealed to me how the world really
worked _ and the government and Harvard and business and the role
of the police,'' said Paul Robins, 40, a computer software designer
in San Francisco.
   ``Over the years, it's helped me understand what I read in the
newspapers and to question everything I hear,'' Robins said.
   The university has made its facilities available for the reunion
but is not taking part officially and has no comment on the
gathering.
   Pusey was not attending the reunion.
   Pusey, 82, and living in New York City, said there was ``no
way'' he would participate in the reunion.
   ``It was just a lot of screaming,'' said Pusey, who ran Harvard
from 1953 to 1971. ``I was disappointed that any students or any
faculty at Harvard accepted the notion that somehow Harvard was the
source of evil and should be attacked.''
   Pusey, who says reports of violence were untrue, blamed the
events on a small group of student agitators.
   ``I honestly did not think the students and faculty at Harvard
would be taken in by these ridiculous things being said,'' he said
Friday.

   Soviet troops and tanks surrounded the main square
and TV station Saturday in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in an
effort to end strikes and protests spurred by nearly a week of
ethnic unrest, an activist said.
   Irina Sarishvili, a spokeswoman for the National Democratic
Party of Georgia, said in a telephone interview from the southern
Soviet republic that thousands of protesters had surrounded
themselves with buses and trolleys in the square to ward off the
soldiers and tanks.
   Interior Ministry soldiers and tanks were deployed Friday after
a protest in which as many as 100,000 people took part, and a
strike that closed down the official television station, schools
and public transportation, she said.
   Ms. Sarishvili said small groups of soldiers were patroling the
streets and that more troops were in nearby buses.
   About 1,500 police officers had been brought in from other
regions of the Soviet Union, she said.
   She said that as of midmorning Saturday thousands of more
Georgians were on the streets of the capital city. She said there
had been no violence in Tbilisi.
   The National Democratic Party of Georgia and other organizers of
the protest are demanding independence from the Soviet Union, but
they accuse the Kremlin of stirring up unrest in the autonomous
region of Abkhazia, located within Georgia.
   Georgian activists say there were clashes between Georgians and
Abkhazians last weekend in the resort city of Sukhumi.
   BBC's World Service radio news in London said more than 100,000
people had taken part in the demonstration in Tbilisi to show their
opposition to a campaign by some groups for more autonomy in the
Abkhazia region of northwestern Georgia.
   The BBC dispatch said 100 ethnic Georgians had begun a hunger
strike to show their anger at the autonomy campaign.
   On Thursday a Georgian activist reported scores of Georgian
nationalists demanding independence for Georgia were on a hunger
strike in front of government buildings in Tbilisi.
   Georgy Chanturia, chairman of the National Democratic Party of
Georgia, said in a telephone interview that 158 Georgians began a
hunger strike Tuesday and plan to continue it until April 14, the
anniversary of a demonstration for ethnic rights in 1978.
   The hunger strikers and thousands of others have been meeting
outside government offices in Tbilisi demanding Georgian
independence, Chanturia said.
   The Tass news agency reported Thursday from Sukhumi that
Abkhazia's Communist Party chief, B.V. Adleiba, has been replaced
by V.F. Khishba. Khishba was first deputy chairman of the Georgian
republic's environment committee in Nagorno-Karabakh, Tass said.
   Tensions have been running high in the Caucasus region for more
than a year, mainly in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, an ethnically
Armenian region that was under control of neighboring Azerbaijan.
   Last fall, demonstrators marched in Tbilisi with a variety of
demands ranging from Georgian independence to the manufacture of
more Georgian-language typewriters.

thereafter submitted his resignation from the NSC. We were being
pressed by the Israelis, I was personally, as to where we were
going from here. And so Mr. McFarlane agreed to go to a meeting
with the Israeli agents and the Iranian in London. I flew over to
the meeting, met General Secord there. He had established that it
was a safe meeting. We sat down and talked with Mr. McFarlane and
the Israelis and their agent who was an Iranian, and we came back
to the United States.
   (North describes three separate presidential intelligence
findings that were signed in connection with the Hawk missile
shipments to Iran.)
   SULLIVAN: Now, did each of these findings state that there
should be no immediate reporting to Congress?
   NORTH: All of them said that Congress shall not be notified at
this time and that the president had the authority to withhold that
notification until he deemed it was appropriate.
   SULLIVAN: During the time that you had operational control over
it, was it considered to be among the most secret of government
activity that was being undertaken in 1986?
   NORTH: Absolutely. ...
   (Sullivan asks North in detail about terrorists threats leveled
against him and a decision by North to accept installation of a
security system at his home. The system was provided by Richard
Secord, a former Air Force major general who had been enlisted by
North to run arms to the Contras.)
   SULLIVAN: Did you pay for the security system?
   NORTH: No, I did not.
   SULLIVAN: Did you receive a security system for or because of
any official act that you had performed or that you were going to
perform in the future?
   NORTH: No.
   SULLIVAN: Did you receive it as any form of compensation because
you were a government official at the National Security Council?
   NORTH: No.
   SULLIVAN: Did you intend to violate any law by receiving the
security system without paying for it?
   NORTH: No. I intended to pay for it.
   SULLIVAN: But did you ever pay for it?
   NORTH: No, I did not.
   SULLIVAN: Colonel North, would you tell the jury briefly,
please, why you and McFarlane went to Iran on a secret trip in May
1986?
   NORTH: The purpose of the trip was to carry out the express
intention of the president that we open a dialogue with Iran about
the Iran-Iraq war, stop Iranian terrorism and get the American
hostages home. ...
   SULLIVAN: Colonel, was there hope that on this particular trip
that all the hostages would come back with you after the
negotiations and after the United States provided certain parts for
missiles?
   NORTH: Not so much come back with us, but there was great hope
because of what the Israeli agent, or intermediary, had told us
were the conditions that the Iranians had, that as a consequence of
going on this trip we would have the hostages released that were
bing held in Beirut, Lebanon, not in Iran; that we would get
William Buckley or his body _ we weren't too sure which at that
point, although we had fairly good intelligence that he was dead _
and that we would get a 400-page interrogation (of Buckley) that
they had done.
   SULLIVAN: Did you leave without accomplishing your objectives on
that trip?
   NORTH: Yes, we did.
   SULLIVAN: Now, Colonel, I would like to focus your attention on
the last couple of months of your service at the National Security
Council ... in early October, one of the planes flying resupply
missions to the (Nicaraguan) freedom fighters was shot down,
correct?
   NORTH: Yes, sir, it was. ...
   SULLIVAN: And did you have a plan how to deal with it?
   NORTH: Yes, we did and the press guidance was basically the same
as what President Eisenhower had done with Francis Gary Powers when
he was shot down over Russia. That was to deny it. ...
   When the airplane was shot down over Nicaragua I was in Europe
working with what we began to call the second channel on the
Iranian initiative. And the initial exposure on the shootdown was
that we would ... deny it. When I got back from Europe (CIA)
Director (William) Casey asked me to come out to the CIA. ... He
asked me pointedly, he said, are we going to be clean on this?
   We being the CIA. And I said yes, I don't think that there's
going to be any way for anybody to take the wreckage or the people,
the survivor and make any connection back to the Central
Intelligence Agency.
   The CIA had, because the rules had changed, the law had changed,
the CIA had been providing weather data and drop zone data,
intelligence data but they didn't have any CIA employees on the
airplane, they didn't have any CIA mechanics working on it, no CIA
purchased equipment was on it because we were still living within
those constraints of the Boland amendment and he wanted my
assurance because he knew that I was basically the operations
officer for this activity, that there was nothing that was going to
trace back to the CIA and I assured him, incorrectly, that no,
everything would be fine.
   And it turned out that there was data aboard the airplane, that
the information that Mr. Hasenfus gave his captors traced back to
where they had launched from, the house that they were living in,
documents that were able to trace it back to the fact that they had
gotten information from the CIA.
   SULLIVAN: Colonel, did you also learn that Casey had received
information that perhaps the Iranian initiative would be exposed
because certain creditors of the operation had not received their
money?
   NORTH: At that same luncheon Director Casey also told me that an
old friend of his, a source I think he told me, of many years back
had revealed to him that certain of the people who had been funding
the purchases of U.S. equipment (for the Iranian arms deal) were
upset by the fact that they had not been paid (and) ... that it was
about to be revealed, that there was a secret arms deal going with
Iran and that monies from the Iran initiative were going to help
the Contras.
   Directory Casey knew all that but his concern was that we do
whatever we could to keep this from coming out.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Loyalist troops at the National
Palace shelled an adjoining army barracks Friday and apparently
routed mutineers demanding the ouster of Haitian leader Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril.
   Western diplomats said the Presidential Guard attacked
Dessalines Barracks, where the rebel soldiers were dug in. There
were unconfirmed reports the elite Leopards unit, also in rebellion
against Avril, had abandoned their base in the suburbs without a
fight when they realized all was lost.
   A government source close to Avril, in power for six stormy
months, said early Saturday that ``the government is in control of
the situation.''
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Susan Clyde also said she thought the
battle was over.
   ``We stand by our statement of the past few days. We support
President Avril so that he can return to his work for the
establishment of democracy,'' Clyde said.
   There were unconfirmed reports of casualties among soldiers and
civilians. One report said shells overshot their mark and hit
nearby houses.
   But officials at the state hospital across a blocked street from
the barracks said they had no casualties from the fighting. And no
casualties were reported at the military hospital, a nearby private
hospital that caters to wealthy Haitians or by the Red Cross.
   Diplomats said a cease-fire had been declared after three hours'
fighting, although sporadic gunfire continued elsewhere.
   A man listening on a citizens-band radio heard soldiers saying
the barracks had been overrun by loyalist troops and that the
rebels were disarmed and forced to lie on the floor face-down with
their hands over their heads.
   The white, neo-classical palace and the mustard-colored barracks
adjoin one other and are surrounded by the same wall.
   The action began at 7:40 p.m. and reporters watched from a
second-floor terrace of the Holiday Inn as at least one armored car
of the 1,000-member Presidential Guard rumbled across the plaza in
front of the palace and fired its cannon. Guardsmen took positions
in the plaza.
   It appeared five armored cars surrounded the barracks, and
within 20 minutes more than a dozen cannon shots accompanied by
steady machine gun fire could be heard.
   Civilians fled the area, some rushing the doors of the hotel.
Reporters dived for cover as explosions reverberated through the
building and tracer bullets zipped overhead.
   State-run radio played romantic French songs during the fighting.
   It was impossible to determine the extent of support within the
7,000-man army for the rebellion centered on the 700-man Dessalines
battalion, the military's second-biggest unit, and the 400-man
Leopards unit.
   The rebels earlier Friday seized control of a radio station, and
youths supporting them built barricades of burning tires along a
main street.
   The rebel soldiers in a statement on Radio Soleil accused Avril
of ``war crimes.''
   U.S. Ambassador Brunson McKinley earlier offered Washington's
support for Avril's government, which foiled a coup attempt Sunday
but has been stymied by the mutiny.
   Rebels rode through the capital in jeeps, pickup trucks and
motorbikes, shooting in the air and warning people to go home,
witnesses said. Youths set fire to tires along the five-mile route
of Delmas Avenue, a main artery in the capital.
   Stores, schools and offices in the capital were closed under a
state of emergency.
   McKinley met with Avril at the National Palace on the third day
of a standoff between loyalist troops and rebels, the U.S. Embassy
said.
   On Thursday night, loyal troops fired on rebels who commandeered
a government vehicle. Witnesses said four rebels were killed, but a
diplomatic source said two died and one was wounded.
   Haitians were largely cut off from developments Thursday night
after loyal troops cut the transmitter cables of at least three
radio stations that had ignored censorship imposed by the
government this week.
   Diplomatic sources said loyalist officers, including interim
army chief Maj. Gen. Gerard Abraham, went to Dessalines Barracks
Thursday to speak to the rebels and returned with an understanding
that a reconciliation agreement was reached. But the rebels reneged
on the deal, said the sources.
   Radio Soleil, a Roman Catholic station that remained on the air,
announced it was being occupied by mutinous soldiers.
   An unidentified soldier said they had seized the station to deny
a statement by Avril that the rebels had decided to end their
dispute. ``That's a lie,'' the soldier said. ``We are holding our
ground.''
   The rebels accuse the government of favoritism toward the
Presidential Guard in pay and living conditions and of arbitrarily
dismissing senior officers in a U.S.-backed crackdown on drugs and
corruption.
   Avril, 50, came to power in a coup led by noncommissioned
officers demanding democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored
violence. The coup ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Avril has restored some constitutional rights suspended in 1987
and approved the establishment of an electoral council to prepare
for elections.
   Thugs killed 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting Haiti's first
free elections in more than 30 years.

   SULLIVAN: What was the danger in revealing the Iranian
initiative in terms of the second channel and the hostages?
   NORTH: Well, the danger that we all saw was that you'd end up
with the political fire storm we ended up with, I mean that
actually happened, that you'd end up with exposure of the kind that
even though officials within the Iranian government knew what was
going on and officials within our government knew what was going
on, that neither the Iranian public nor the American public were
going to be particularly happy with this. (And) ... that the people
in Lebanon who held the hostages would be so outraged by this
involvement.
   SULLIVAN: Was there a time when it was thought that there would
be a cover story that would have to be used in order to protect the
Iranian initiative?
   NORTH: There was a cover story. There had been a cover story _
   SULLIVAN: Describe what you mean?
   NORTH: There had been a cover story since February of 1986 when
we started to get the Hawk missiles back out of Iran. We told the
Iranians because they were so upset with that Israeli shipment that
we had nothing to do with it ...
   (North describes a number of ``chronologies'' that were being
developed by the CIA, Poindexter and McFarlane in connection with
the Iranian initiatives.)
   SULLIVAN: What was your understanding of what the president was
saying publicly about these matters?
   NORTH: Well, the president had publicly said that they didn't
happen either, which was initially part of the cover story.
   SULLIVAN: What conclusion did you draw from that?
   NORTH: ... I had no idea what was in the minds of other people
but it was very clear to me that the president himself out publicly
on a number of occasions ... and people were digging a pretty deep
hole, without me helping them, in advancing (the cover) story.

   Few visible scars remain from
``Terrible Tuesday,'' the day 10 years ago when a tornado tore an
eight-mile path of destruction, but residents will never forget the
deadly twister.
   The April 10, 1979, tornado killed 46 people, injured 1,700 and
left 20,000 homeless. It demolished more than 2,566 houses, 1,100
apartments, 81 businesses, several schools and churches and left
the city without water and, in some parts of town, electricity.
   The tornado, which stayed on the ground 47 minutes, caused an
estimated $300 million in damages.
   The asbestos-sided homes destroyed by the storm have been
replaced with sturdier, brick-front dwellings, just one sign of the
city's recovery.
   But ask anyone who lived here then; it was terrifying.
   ``This reminds me every day of that cyclone,'' said 80-year-old
Oscar Groves, pulling up his left pant leg to display a swollen
knee.
   Groves has scars like hash marks across his bald head, reminders
of the flying glass and wood that hit him as he tried to escape the
storm's fury.
   He remembers lying on top of his terrified wife in his bathroom
while the twister screamed overhead.
   ``That thing just bounced me up and down,'' Groves said. His
knee has been sore ever since.
   The twister turned their house in the Faith Village subdivision
into debris. Groves and his wife, Merle, had lived in the home
since 1953.
   ``All that was left standing of this house was the bathtub, the
hot water heater and the commode,'' Groves said.
   ``We just had blocks and blocks of total devastation,'' said
Wichita Falls city spokeswoman Norma Crane. ``We figured it would
take about 10 years to get it all back.''
   In fact, 80 percent of the lost buildings were replaced within a
year. Today, virtually every structure that was destroyed has been
rebuilt in this town of 98,900, which is about 140 miles northwest
of Dallas, near the Oklahoma border.
   ``That part of the city has grown tremendously since the
tornado,'' Ms. Crane said.
   Many of the homes, schools, churches and businesses were rebuilt
with assistance from the federal government and a $14 million bond
issue. That effort won Wichita Falls the ``All-America City''
designation in 1980.
   ``There's been a lot of good come out of the tornado,'' said
Merle Pedigo, a retired Air Force chaplain who helped organize
rebuilding efforts. ``Lots of people's homes were rebuilt.''
   Churches helped many residents like the Groves.
   Six months after the tragedy, a group of Mennonites from as far
away as Canada started rebuilding the Groves' home. Groves supplied
the materials and used a $12,000 loan from the Small Business
Association to replace appliances, furniture and other items lost
in the storm.
   Their three-bedroom house now has a red-brick facade instead of
its old asbestos siding.
   ``We had to get everything new, but this house is built strong
now,'' he said.
   Others on his devastated street began rebuilding as well,
including Ben Milam Elementary, where a storm-tossed Volkswagen
remained embedded in a classroom wall for weeks after the tornado.
   Behind the new bricks and mortar of Wichita Falls, residents
keep various mementos of the storm.
   For the Groves, one reminder comes once a month in the mail: the
payment notice for their SBA rebuilding loan, on which they still
owe more than $5,000.
   And in his garage, Groves still stores his old refrigerator,
which he found in the school yard across the street after the
twister passed, and a 1965 GMC pickup dented during the storm.
   ``I keep them as souvenirs,'' he said.

   Crews tackling the worst oil spill in U.S.
history got good news from Washington on who's in charge of the
cleanup and bad news from a weather forecast that could put
untainted shoreline in jeopardy.
   Only 7 percent of the 10.1 million gallons of oil has been
retrieved.
   President Bush announced Friday he was sending military troops
to help clean up the oil that leaked from tanker Exxon Valdez on
March 24.
   Bush said the Coast Guard was taking control of the operation,
ending days of bickering and weeks of frustration over the oil
company's efforts.
   ``I think we had a problem with organization _ that's what
frustrated everybody,'' said Rear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr., the
commander of the Coast Guard's Alaskan district who now heads the
cleanup operation. ``We now see a clean line of what's going to go
on.''
   Under the new plan, reached by compromise at the request of
Alaskan officials, the Coast Guard will have final responsibility
for running the cleanup effort. Exxon will continue to provide the
materials and manpower and will not be relieved of liability.
   ``We'll be directing the strategic application of forces. ...
Exxon retains the role of support,'' said Nelson.
   The change in command came as weather forecasters warned of a
change in the winds that have pushed nearly half the oil south and
out of the environmentally sensitive Prince William Sound in the
two weeks since the tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef.
   The shift in direction threatens to push oil slicks, which have
already traveled over a 3,000-square-mile area in the Gulf of
Alaska, toward Kodiak Island and the fragile bays and inlets of the
Kenai Peninsula.
   So far, only an estimated 16,000 barrels of oil have been sopped
and vacuumed up from the once-clear water of Prince William Sound.
The spill has killed thousands of birds and sea otters along the
central Alaskan coast, cost fishermen millions of dollars in lost
catch and continues to threaten valuable salmon fisheries.
   A shift in the wind ``could easily double the area affected,''
said Jim Hayden, coordinator of the state's cleanup effort.
   A large oil slick continued to threaten the edges of Kenai
Fjords National Park, a remote refuge 100 miles southwest of
Valdez, as workers set up floating oil booms to protected against
the expected onslaught.
   ``We're preparing for the worse case,'' said John Quinley, a
spokesman for the National Park Service. ``Even if this doesn't
foul the beaches this stuff could be there for a long time.''
   Bush said at a news conference in Washington that he was
directing Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to make military forces and
equipment available. He also directed Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner to coordinate the effort.
   Bush had been under pressure from members of Congress and
Alaskan officials to intervene. Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper on
Wednesday asked the Coast Guard to take over management of the
cleanup from Exxon.
   The president insisted, however, ``We are not federalizing this
operation,'' and that ``this should not relieve Exxon from any of
its responsibilities or liabilities.''
   State officials said they were pleased with Bush's decision but
worried that the use of military troops in the cleaup might disrupt
the effort and deny jobs to state residents.
   But Nelson said he didn't anticipate the wholesale use of troops.
   ``We have a plan and we want to proceed rather cautiously,'' he
said. ``What we're really going to do is have local hire.''
   Cowper said he was pleased with Bush's action, although he
agrees that Alaskans should get available work before the military.
   ``It appears the president is meeting the objectives we had in
asking the Coast Guard to take over the spill cleanup in Prince
William Sound,'' he said.

   A nuclear-powered Soviet submarine sank more
than 300 miles off the coast of Norway after suffering an
underwater accident and catching fire, U.S. and Norwegian officials
said Friday.
   U.S. officials said there were ``definitely'' casualties on
board the stricken submarine, but declined to estimate how many.
   The Soviet Embassy in Oslo confirmed the sinking but provided no
details, according to a Norwegian Radio report on Saturday. There
was no other word on the accident out of the government in Moscow
or from the official Tass news agency.
   ABC News reported Friday night that Pentagon sources said as
many as a dozen were killed in the fire, while others were rescued
by sister Soviet ships that rushed to the scene. The submarine is
believed to carry a crew of 95, according to the authoritative
reference book, ``Jane's Fighting Ships.''
   Officials told The Associated Press that the submarine managed
to surface for a time in the Norwegian Sea after the accident
occurred and that at least one Soviet ship had responded to a
distress call and arrived on scene.
   ``It was on the surface, but now it appears it's gone,'' said
one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We're trying to
get confirmation, but we believe it sunk.''
   Norwegian Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst was quoted on the
West German government radio as saying that pilots of
reconnaissance planes reported seeing bodies at the site. In
addition, the radio reported that Holst believes the submarine
broke in two as it sank and that the Soviets turned down Norwegian
offers of help.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the accident
appeared to involve a Soviet ``Mike'' submarine _ one of the
Russian Navy's newer attack subs designed to hunt and destroy other
submarines in the event of war.
   ``There are indications there was a major fire aboard, but we
have no details. We understand there has been a loss of life but we
can't confirm how many,'' Fitzwater said. ``We express the sympathy
of the United States government to the Soviet government for any
loss of life involved.''
   President Bush had been notified of the accident, Fitzwater said.
   One U.S. source placed the last known position of the vessel
about 310 miles to the north of Norway's North Cape.
   Another U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said it was not known what caused the problem, precisely when the
accident occurred or whether the nuclear propulsion section of the
craft was involved.
   A nuclear specialist at a Washington think-tank called the
technology used in the Mike sub ``inherently very dangerous'' and
said that if the reactor had been involved, ``it could be quite
catastrophic.''
   In Oslo, a Norwegian army supreme command spokesman said the sub
apparently was lost in the area between Norway and Greenland. Col.
Gollow Gjeseth, press spokesman of Norway's Supreme Defense
Command, said in a telephone interview that a Norwegian observation
plane sent over the area about 11 EDT saw ``a Soviet ship and two
rubber boats.''
   NTB, the national news agency, said the plane saw several Soviet
planes and vessels in the area, apparently part of a Soviet rescue
operation in the area, which is in international waters.
   The agency said people had been sighted in at least one of the
rubber boats, but it was not clear if the boats were from the
submarine or from one of the surface vessels.
   The biggest surface ship in the area was a Soviet refrigerator
trawler, the NTB report said.
   U.S. sources offered no indication as to what the submarine
might have been doing at the time of the accident. They said the
U.S. Navy had no warships in the area and had not received any
request from the Soviet Union for assistance. The sources declined
to say when or how the United States first became aware of the
submarine's problems.
   But ABC News reported that Pentagon sources said U.S.
intelligence learned of the accident through electronic intercepts
of communications from the stricken submarine.
   According to ``Jane's Fighting Ships,'' the Soviets have so far
launched only one ship in the ``Mike'' class.
   That vessel was launched in May 1983 and went into service in
late 1984, according to Jane's. The Pentagon reference book
``Soviet Military Power'' says the Mike vessel wasn't declared
operational until 1986.
   The proper Russian name for the submarine was not immediately
available. The name ``Mike'' is a U.S. and NATO nickname for the
sub.
   Jane's describes the Mike submarine's two nuclear reactors as
``probably liquid metal cooled,'' an approach that ``allows for a
saving in space as well as an increase in power.''
   The sources stressed, however, it was unclear whether the
nuclear propulsion section of the Russian sub had been the source
of the accident or involved in any fires.
   The Mike submarine is described as being about 361 feet long and
capable of steaming at 38 knots when submerged. The sub displaces
about 6,400 tons when submerged.
   Jane's and other Pentagon reference books describe the Mike as a
submarine that ``seems to be a test vehicle for new design and
propulsion features.''
   Administration sources said U.S. intelligence agencies have long
assumed the Mike sub was built to serve as a ``test platform'' for
new types of submarine-launched cruise missiles.
   The accident with the Mike comes 2{ years after a Soviet
``Yankee-class'' missile submarine sank off the coast of North
Carolina after an explosion and fire. That fire was believed to
have involved the liquid fuel propellant inside a nuclear missile.
   That incident was just the latest in a string of accidents over
the years involving Soviet submarines and nuclear-powered vessels.
   According to William Arkin, a specialist on nuclear weaponry
with the liberal think tank Institute for Policy Studies, the
Soviet navy has suffered more than 200 serious accidents with
submarines just since 1975.
   U.S. Defense Department officials have long asserted the Russian
navy does not attach as much importance to the safety of their
nuclear operations as do Western navies.
   While stressing he had no idea whether the Mike submarine's
nuclear reactor had been involved in the accident, Arkin said that
particular technology was ``inherently very dangerous.''
   ``This sub carries two liquid metal cooled reactors; you are
literally using molten metal, probably sodium,'' Arkin said.
   ``It is a more efficient means of propulsion than using steam
water, but it is very dangerous and very difficult to operate. We
tried it once and gave up because we considered it too volatile. So
if it was a reactor incident, it could be quite catastrophic.''

   Elementary school principal Steve Hall may
hedge his bets in the future.
   He lost a wager with the Albany Elementary's 275 students that
they could not collectively read 1 million pages of books or
magazine articles by April 21.
   His penalty: a day on the school roof.
   Hall set up a desk with a telephone on the roof Friday and
received notes and messages by rope and bucket under cloudy skies
and in temperatures in the 40s. He had several visitors; many
carried cameras.
   The students, monitored by teachers and parents, made good on
the bet by Feb. 27. On the average, each student read about 4,500
pages, Hall said. Medals were awarded to those who read more than
3,000 pages.
   Hall said he wanted to motivate the students to read, but he
didn't think they would complete the task.
   ``We're proud of them, it was a good effort,'' he said.

   Judy McMillan celebrated her election to the
village board. The only downside was that she beat her mother.
   ``I feel great about winning,'' Mrs. McMillan said. ``I'm sorry
mom didn't make it, too, but I know she'll be supporting me all the
time.''
   Mrs. McMillan and her mother, Carrie Edgeton, were two of the
four candidates for the three-member Dana Village Board. Mrs.
Edgeton finished last with 34 votes, only six votes behind her
daughter in Tuesday's election.
   The two women ran on similar platforms: a desire for civic
improvements that would spruce up the north central Illinois town
of 250 people.
   The mother is not a sore loser. She noted her daughter entered
the race first.
   ``We've lived here since 1957,'' Mrs. Edgeton said, ``and I
don't remember a woman ever being on the board. We kidded Judy that
she should run. I just sort of got interested along the way and
decided a lot later that I'd run, too.''
   Mrs. McMillan said her mother will keep a close eye on the board.
   ``Mom will probably be at a lot of the meetings, so she'll be
keeping up with things and lending her support.''

   Southern Californians could get some relief today from a record
heat wave, while North Dakota and Minnesota residents scramble to
protect their homes against what's expected to be some of the worst
flooding this century.
   In the East, folks bundled up for damp or snowy weather today.
   A fourth day of record Southern California heat shut down a
hospital emergency room Friday and trapped smog in the valleys.
   Downtown Los Angeles had a high of 100 degrees, breaking the
date's record of 88 set in 1904 and tied in 1962. The city reached
a record-tying 100 on Tuesday and had record highs of 105 Wednesday
and 106 Thursday.
   In Minnesota and North Dakota, property owners stood in line at
emergency management offices to buy sandbags to protect their homes
from Red River flooding.
   ``We just can't keep up,'' said Jim Grondahl, an emergency
services director in North Dakota. ``We went through another 11,000
(bags) this morning and I've got more on order.''
   In the East, springtime snows were expected in the northern and
central Appalachians as well as parts of New England today, though
little accumulation was forecast.
   California's Santa Ana weather pattern, which began with warm
winds last weekend and pushed highs into triple digits Tuesday, was
dissipating, and a cooling trend was expected today, National
Weather Service forecasters said.
   Still, the heat maintained a sweltering presence Friday. San
Diego topped out at 93 _ 8 degrees above the 1962 record and 25
degrees above normal.
   In northern California, records continued to melt away, too.
   Santa Cruz recorded the high for the Bay area with 94 degrees,
breaking the previous high for the date of 88 set in 1899. San Jose
came in with 93 degrees, to beat a 1934 record of 84. San
Francisco's high of 92 degrees broke the previous record of 81 set
in 1939 and set an all-time high for the month of April.
   The University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center was
forced to shut its emergency rooms after a 20-minute fire Thursday
night knocked out the air conditioning.
   The blaze in two rooftop air conditioning cooling towers caused
no injuries or evacuations. The cooling system was repaired and was
expected to be cooling off patient wards today, said spokeswoman
Vicki Beck.
   Elsewhere, thousands sought relief at the beaches, but they had
to cross hot-as-griddle sands to reach the ocean.
   Lifeguard Randy DeGregori, watching over some of the 60,000
people crowded near the water on Santa Monica Beach, figured the
sand was 10 or 15 degrees hotter than the air.
   First-stage smog alerts were issued for part of the San Gabriel
Valley east of Los Angeles and to the west in the Santa Monica
area. The alerts mean pollutants were at levels unhealthful for
everyone.
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner asked the state Legislature to
allow using up to $1.5 million in profits from a state-run bank to
help the Red River Valley rebuild after rampant flooding. The
Senate Appropriations Committee on Friday amended Sinner's request
into the budget.
   In Minnesota, the state Senate Finance Committee approved a
$250,000 appropriation to provide emergency flood assistance for
the Red River Valley.
   The Red River forms the boundary between Minnesota and North
Dakota. The 533-mile river flows north into Lake Winnipeg in Canada.
   Runoff from the winter's heavy snowfall sent the river and two
adjoining rivers over their banks earlier this week in the
communities of Breckenridge, Minn., and Wahpeton, N.D., forcing the
evacuation of scores of residents and damaging hundreds of homes.
   The river had risen to a level of more than 32 feet Friday and
was expected to crest at 36{ feet late Sunday or Monday, which
would be the second-worst flood this century in the cities. The
river rose to 37.3 feet during a 1969 flood. Flood stage is 17 feet.
   ``I've lived here a long time and I've never seen it like
this,'' Willard Eckes of Wahpeton said as he surveyed a submerged
city park across the street from his home. ``This is something that
comes along only once in a lifetime.''

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. and the operator of the
trans-Alaska oil-pipeline terminal could face fines exceeding $700
million as a result of the nation's worst oil spill, a review of
state and federal law indicates.
   State attorneys have been monitoring the spill cleanup in Prince
William Sound and collecting evidence of damages since the tanker
Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24, said Doug Mertz, an assistant
state attorney general.
   More than 10 million gallons of crude oil leaked from the
tanker, killing fish, marine mammals, birds and other wildlife over
a 3,000-square-mile area, and affecting the livelihoods of
fishermen and others who live in the region.
   Exxon Corp. and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. are the two
companies that likely will bear the brunt of the state and federal
governments' legal attack.
   ``They're certainly the principal players,'' Mertz said Friday.
   Exxon owns the tanker through a corporate division, and also
owns the oil. Alyeska, a consortium of seven oil companies, owns
and operates the pipeline terminal where the tanker took on its
load of oil.
   Both companies were responsible for the initial spill response,
which has been attacked by government officials and
environmentalists as slow and ineffective.
   Alaska's legal ammunition includes several laws that provide for
hefty fines against companies responsible for polluting the
environment.
   For large spills, the state can assess a $1- to $10-per-gallon
civil fine regardless of fault. It is automatically multiplied by
five in cases of ``gross negligence'' or when spill damages
increase because of poor cleanup response, Mertz said.
   A complex formula determines the fine, based on how damaging the
spill is to the environment. Mertz said the maximum civil fine for
spills in a marine environment such as Prince William Sound is
$2.50 a gallon. The $10-a-gallon fine applies only to serious
damage in freshwater, fish-bearing streams.
   However, it is possible the top fine could apply to the Exxon
Valdez spill. The state would have to prove the oil had damaged any
of the dozens of freshwater streams that feed the sound, Mertz said.
   If the maximum fine and the ``automatic multiplier'' were
applied, the oil companies could be assessed more than $500
million. The fine would be spread among the liable parties, Mertz
said.
   The state also can seek compensation for damages to natural
resources, including those damages that cannot be measured, and for
the state's costs of containment and cleanup, he said.
   Another state law allows for a civil fine of up to $100,000, and
the state can seek additional damages under federal environmental
laws. It also is possible the state will seek to recover lost
oil-royalty income, Mertz said.
   Mertz declined to speculate how high the state fines could
total, noting the issue could be appealed in court.
   ``I would not even come close to hazarding a guess,'' he said.
``The totality of natural resource damages is so difficult to
compute. It can be done but it requires a lot of expertise and
takes a lot of time.''
   Mertz estimated it could take six to 12 years to resolve the
liability issues and fines in court.
   ``Spills of this magnitude take years and years to get to trial.
It's just impossible to predict what way it will go,'' he said.
   Ann Prezyna, an attorney with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in Seattle, said most federal fines would arise from
violations of the Clean Water Act.

   A former live-in maid has been charged with
stealing more than $880,000 from a paraplegic widow while keeping
the elderly woman a prisoner in her own home.
   Barbara Stevens, 54, confined Valeria Lust to her Lakeland home
by giving her incapacitating drugs and taking away the 71-year-old
woman's walker and telephone, according to court documents.
   While living with the widow for a year until January 1988, Ms.
Stevens forged her name on 20 checks worth $883,534 and gave some
of the money to a North Carolina-based television ministry,
according to an affidavit filed Thursday.
   In a separate civil case, Mrs. Lust claims more than $700,000 of
her money went to the Fountain of Life Inc. ministry.
   Jim Whittington, president of Fountain of Life, confirmed the
ministry received about $700,000 from Mrs. Lust, and said the money
was a donation.
   Ms. Stevens, who was arrested Thursday, was charged with 20
counts of grand theft, 21 counts of forgery, 20 counts of uttering
a forged instrument and false imprisonment.
   She was ordered held in the Polk County Jail in lieu of $500,000
bail.
   In June, Mrs. Lust's attorneys sued the ministry, claiming Ms.
Stevens used undue influence to get her to donate more than
$700,000, court records state.
   Although $711,941 allegedly was deposited in a North Carolina
account set up in the names of Ms. Stevens and Mrs. Lust, the widow
told authorities she knew of no such account.
   The civil lawsuit between Mrs. Lust and Fountain of Life is
pending. No criminal trial date has been set.
   Melonie Milling, Ms. Stevens' 27-year-old daughter, also lived
in Mrs. Lust's home, investigators said.
   Ms. Stevens illegally obtained prescription drugs and gave them
to Mrs. Lust to keep her sleepy so she would not complain, Ms.
Milling told authorities.
   Ms. Milling also said her mother disconnected the telephone in
the woman's bedroom and told her: ``See, no one cares, no one
calls; your children don't even call.''
   Mrs. Lust, a paraplegic since suffering a stroke in 1982, also
has impaired vision as a result of unsuccessful cataract surgery.

   Navajo police enforced a court order
barring embattled Chairman Peter MacDonald from his offices at the
nation's largest Indian tribe, and minor violence marred an
anti-MacDonald rally.
   MacDonald did not show up for work Friday, and his staff was out
of the administration building by the time the tribal officers
closed the offices.
   About 750 people turned up for a demonstration stemming from the
Tribal Council's 49-13 vote on Feb. 17 to place MacDonald and Vice
Chairman Johnny R. Thompson on administrative leave.
   MacDonald, who has been accused in U.S. Senate testimony of
receiving gifts and kickbacks in connection with tribal business
dealings, had offered to step down temporarily but recanted when
the tribe refused to pay his anticipated defense costs.
   Tribal business conducted since MacDonald was re-elected in 1986
reportedly is the subject of a probe by a federal grand jury in
Phoenix.
   MacDonald publicly has denied any wrongdoing, but he has refused
to discuss the allegations against him with reporters.
   Spokesman Ferlin Clark said Friday that MacDonald would have no
comment on the latest developments.
   At the demonstration, tribal police arrested two anti-MacDonald
demonstrators, used tear gas on the crowd and threatened to turn
fire hoses on others. No injuries were reported.
   A tribal police sergeant, who refused to give his name, said the
two arrests at the demonstration occurred after a fight and an
assault on a MacDonald bodyguard.
   The Navajo Reservation, home to the nation's largest Indian
tribe, includes parts of northeastern Arizona, northwestern New
Mexico and southeastern Utah.

<HEAD>Bus Hijacker Wanted Syria Out Of Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An armed man who hijacked a New York-bound
Greyhound bus and held its driver and 10 passengers hostage was
demanding reduced Syrian involvement in Lebanon, police say.
   The hijacking ended peacefully on Parliament Hill and without
injuries when the last five hostages were freed Friday evening,
eight hours after the ordeal started in Montreal.
   Before surrendering, the hijacker _ who claimed to be holding
dynamite _ held police at bay for five hours after the bus veered
onto the muddy lawn at the center of Canadian government.
   Charles Yacoub, 36, of Montreal, was identified as the man who
took over the bus as it left that city. Police said he was
demanding action on behalf of the Front for the Liberation of
Christian Lebanon, a group that authorities aren't even sure exists.
   Private CTV television quoted security sources as saying the
gunman was demanding that Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon and
free all the prisoners they hold. Syria sent troops into Lebanon as
a peacekeeping force after the civil war between Lebanese Moslems
and Christians erupted in 1975.
   Gilles Favreau, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, did not say what charges would be filed against
Yacoub.
   He also could not explain why the police did not know the bus
was heading for Parliament until its arrival, which raised
questions about security in the area.
   ``You've got to realize that this bus was going to New York,''
Favreau said at a news conference.
   Henry Jensen, deputy commissioner of the Mounties, said Yacoub
emigrated to Canada from Lebanon in 1976.
   The hijacker released the first hostage, an elderly man, at the
Champlain Bridge just outside of Montreal before heading on to
Ottawa, 100 miles to the west.
   Three female hostages and one man were released gradually at
Ottawa, and the male driver left the vehicle just before the
hijacking came to an end. Police briefly checked the final five
hostages before concluding they were not involved with the hijacker.
   The hijacker had claimed to have explosives, but none were found.
   Witnesses said they heard at least three shots, and they
believed all were fired by the hijacker as police rushed to the
site where the bus was stuck on the lawn in front of the House of
Commons.
   The red, white and blue bus sat the extensive lawn of Parliament
Hill surrounded by police hiding behind their vehicles or nearby
walls. A police van stopped behind the bus at midafternoon, and
officers jumped out and crouched behind the van's doors.
   Traffic was blocked off and and people cleared from the area,
including pedestrians at the front of the U.S. Embassy, across the
street from the House of Commons. stopped.
   Forty embassy employees took a difficult route out of the
building, dismantling a window in the building next door and
crawling out.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has offices in the House of
Commons but was attending a private event and was not in the
building, his aides reported.
   Oscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, was speaking at a news
conference a short distance from Parliament Hill as the crisis
developed.
   Unaware of the hijacking, Arias told reporters, ``Political
violence (in Canada) in the worst of times has been limited to the
madness of a few.''

<TEXT>
   Zoologists at the University of
Malaya said today they have found a frog that grows out of an egg
instead of going through the tadpole stage in water.
   Zoology professor Yong Hoi Sen said he and a team of colleagues
discovered a tree frog, philautus aurifasciatus, which can breed on
land without water, while on a jungle expedition last February in
the Genting Highlands area about 20 miles east of Kuala Lumpur.
   He said the eggs were found on a pitcher plant, and were the
first time such a frog had been found in Malaysia.
   Most frogs lay eggs in water that become tadpoles, which mature
into frogs and leave the water. Yong said the tree frog the
zoologists discovered lays its eggs on land and that the eggs hatch
frogs.
   He said news of the discovery was withheld to carry out breeding
and tests.
   The frog is one of 17 species found on Malaysian trees. There
are 70 species of frogs in Malaysia.
   The philautus aurifasciatus also has been found in South America
and Australia and are known to exist in Thailand, Cambodia,
Indonesia and the Philippines, Yong said.

   The Soviet Mike-class submarine that caught
fire and sank after an underwater accident off the coast of Norway
is one of the most modern nuclear-armed and powered boats in the
Soviet fleet, capable of hurling advanced warheads up to 1,600
miles, Western experts say.
   The Soviets have only one of the 361-foot-long, titanium-hulled
Mike-class submarines in service, according to Jane's Fighting
Ships. It entered service in 1984.
   It is used primarily to test various advanced weapons systems,
is believed to be powered by two liquid-cooled nuclear reactors,
and has a double hull designed to reduce noise and make it harder
to detect, according to Jane's.
   The submarine can carry long-range ballistic missiles as well as
SS-N-21 cruise missiles, according to the Pentagon book, ``Soviet
Military Power.''

   Hundreds of U.S. and Soviet crew members have died in accidents
involving nuclear-powered submarines since the first, the USS
Nautilus, was launched in 1954. Here is a list of accidents which
have been disclosed to the public:
   Oct. 3, 1986: A Soviet Yankee-class submarine, powered by two
nuclear reactors and carrying up to 16 nuclear-tipped missiles, was
wracked by fire and an explosion while cruising submerged about
1,000 miles off the North Carolina coast. The Soviets said three
sailors died in the fire and explosion, but the rest of the crew
was rescued before the sub sank to the ocean floor Oct. 6.
   April 29, 1986: The U.S. attack submarine Atlanta ran aground
while passing through the Straits of Gibraltar. The Navy said there
were no injuries, no damage to the nuclear propulsion system and
that the sub went to Gibraltar under its own power.
   April 1, 1986: The USS Nathaniel Green, armed with
nuclear-tipped Poseidon missiles, ran aground in the Irish Sea.
Although no major injuries were reported, the damage forced the
Navy to scrap the vessel.
   March 21, 1984: A Soviet submarine collided with the U.S.
aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk off Japan. No injuries were reported.
   Sept. 27, 1984: The USS Sam Rayburn, a Poseidon submarine,
collided with barrels containing nuclear waste off the British
coast, according to an anti-nuclear group.
   Sept. 21, 1984: The USS Jacksonville, an attack submarine,
collided with a Navy barge, causing superficial damage to the sub.
   Sept. 20, 1984: A Soviet Golf II class ballistic missile
submarine is spotted drifting in the Sea of Japan, with white smoke
pouring from its stern. The submarine later was reported to have
returned to its base in Vladivostok under its own steam.
   Dec. 23, 1983: The Navy said the USS Florida, a Poseidon
submarine, hit a submerged object during sea trials but was not
damaged.
   Summer 1983: A Soviet submarine sank in the northern Pacific,
killing 90 crew members, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
   Dec. 16, 1982: Two U.S. submarines, the La Jolla and the Permit,
collided during sea trials off San Diego but suffered only minor
damage.
   Nov. 30, 1982: The USS Thomas Edison collided with a Navy
destroyer in the South China Sea. No injuries were reported.
   March 24, 1982: The Jacksonville suffered $2 million in damage
in a collision with a Turkish freighter off the Virginia coast.
Both were able to continue under their own power.
   April 9, 1981: The USS George Washington, a missile submarine,
ran into the Japanese freighter Nisso Maru, sinking the surface
vessel off the southern tip of Japan, and killing two crewmen from
the Japanese ship.
   Oct. 27, 1981: A Soviet Whiskey-class diesel-powered submarine
ran aground in a restricted military zone in Sweden.
   Aug. 23, 1980: A Soviet Echo-1-class nuclear submarine caught
fire and radioed for help off Japan. Japanese officials later
reported that nine crew men died and three were injured in what
remains a mysterious accident.
   Feb. 5, 1977: The USS Snook collided with a sonar device being
towed by a Navy ship, damaging the submarine's periscope and
superstructure. No one was injured and there were no radiation
leaks, officials said.
   May 21, 1968: The USS Scorpion, an attack submarine, was lost
with 99 men aboard off the Azores in the Atlantic.
   1968: A Soviet submarine sank off the Kola Peninsula in the
Arctic Sea, according to recently declassified CIA documents.
   1968: A Soviet submarine sank in the Pacific, and subsequent
U.S. attempts to recover the wreck were partially successful.
   April 10, 1963: The USS Thresher was lost 220 miles off the New
England coast with all 129 men aboard; an investigation found that
the sub had gone into sea tests without adequate safety precautions.
   1961: Members of a Soviet submarine crew died of radiation
poisoning after an accident in the Baltic, according to recently
declassified CIA documents.

   A man with AIDS arrived from the
Netherlands after six days in a Minnesota prison and a battle with
immigration officials who refused to let him attend a U.S.
conference on the disease because of his illness.
   Hans Paul Verhoef, who was required by an immigration judge to
post a $10,000 bond, was given a bouquet of flowers by
representatives of the National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference
upon his arrival Friday night.
   Verhoef, who was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service on Sunday at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International
Airport, declined to answer questions, saying he was very tired.
   A news conference with the 31-year-old AIDS worker was planned
today.
   ``We're very happy to have him finally here in San Francisco,''
said Scott Schafer, an aide to the mayor.
   A dozen or so supporters greeted Verhoef at the airport.
   ``I came because I think it's taken tremendous courage to take
on the great, big United States of America when you're just a
foreign visitor trying to help the world fight a terrible
disease,'' said Jennifer Maher.
   Verhoef flew into San Francisco just hours after a judge
overrode immigration officials and ordered him freed from the Oak
Park Heights State Prison so he could attend the conference.
   Immigration Judge Robert Vinikoor ruled Friday that Verhoef had
met standards allowing him to be excluded from laws barring
foreigners with dangerous and communicable diseases from entering
the country.
   Vinikoor's decision overrode INS officials in Washington who
denied Verhoef's request for a waiver to attend the AIDS conference.
   The INS then asked the federal Board of Immigration Appeals in
Falls Church, Va., to stay the judge's order. But Friday night the
board refused to consider the request.
   Vinikoor ordered Verhoef to post a $10,000 bond to enforce the
terms of the waiver, effective until April 28. The money was
provided by Minnesota AIDS Project, said Helene Haapala, one of
Verhoef's lawyers.
   ``I'm very disappointed being imprisoned and getting this
treatment in this country,'' Verhoef said before boarding the
flight to San Francisco.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, mostly between
homosexual males; needles or syringes shared by drug abusers;
infected blood or blood products; and from pregnant women to their
offspring.

   A Chinese dissident put on a plane out of
the country by his government said his future is in limbo after he
arrived in the United States with $100 in his pocket.
   ``I cannot say I have been expelled. I do not know if I can go
back,'' Chen Jun told about three dozen reporters after he landed
at San Francisco International Airport on Friday evening.
   Chen, a 31-year-old Beijing bar owner, organized a petition in
February calling for immediate amnesty for political prisoners in
China. He was taken into custody Wednesday by government officials,
who said they needed to question him about possible parole
violations for a money changing conviction.
   He left Friday night for New York, where friends offered to give
him a place to stay.
   Although he declined to characterize himself as having been
expelled, he said he was ``was left no choice about whether to
leave or stay.''
   Earlier Friday, officials in Hong Kong had refused to let Chen
enter the colony, the dissident's British wife, Jenny Holdaway,
told reporters in Beijing.
   Chen boarded a Singapore Airlines jet for San Francisco when
Hong Kong officials refused to let him out of the Hong Kong airport
transit area.
   He arrived there Friday after Shanghai police, who had been
holding him for more than 36 hours, put him on a plane out of
China, she said. A Shanghai government official said he did not
know if Chen would be allowed to return.
   Several of those greeting Chen in San Francisco carried signs
with slogans reading, ``It is time to change China's destiny. The
only way to save China is democracy.''
   Huang Chuen Yu, chairman of the Chinese Democratic Education
Foundation, called the Chinese government's actions a ``very bad,
serious setback for the democratic reform movement under way.''
   An official at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office, who would
identify himself only as Mr. Fu, said Chen left the country
voluntarily.
   Chen had no Hong Kong visa but has a U.S. green card that gives
him residency rights. He lived in the United States from 1984 to
1987 and was married part of that time to an American woman.
   Ms. Holdaway said Chen and his father, He Weidu, were taken into
police custody Wednesday when they arrived in Shanghai from
Beijing. The father was released that night.
   Chen was kept in custody until he was put on the plane, and
other family members in Shanghai were refused permission to see
him, Ms. Holdaway said. He was allowed to call her just before
leaving.
   She said Chen had hoped to leave for the United States in a few
weeks for a prolonged stay and went to Shanghai to ask officials to
return his passport, which was confiscated last year.
   Last year, Chen was arrested in Shanghai, his hometown, for
changing U.S. dollars on the black market. Chen admitted to
changing money and agreed to pay a $5,300 fine.

<HEAD>Rain, Snow Across Midwest; Temperatures To Dip Under 100 In California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain and snow fell on much of the Midwest today, adding to
flooding problems in North Dakota and Minnesota. In Southern
California, the forecast called for more heat, but highs were
expected to cool to below 100 degrees.
   Rain fell from western sections of the lower Ohio Valley across
the middle Mississippi Valley to the lower Missouri Valley,
changing to snow across parts of southern and eastern Minnesota and
northern Iowa. Two inches of snow fell at Mason City, Iowa, Poplar
Lake, Minn., and Estherville, Iowa, on Friday night.
   Flooding continued along the Red River in eastern North Dakota
as runoff has resulted in significant rises in the river. The
potential for ice jams remained great and rapid fluctuations of 1
to 3 feet were possible.
   A flood warning remained in effect for the Kennebec River in
Maine. The river was forecast to crest at 4 feet above flood stage
at Augusta, Maine, this morning before slowly receding.
   Rain fell over the mid-Atlantic Coast and southern New England.
Gusty winds also accompanied the low pressure system and gale
warnings were in effect along the coast from Maine to North
Carolina.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EST
included around 1 inch at Dover, Del., and three-quarters of an
inch at Millville, N.J.
   Strong winds howled across the higher elevations of the Colorado
Rockies, with gusts in excess of 70 mph at Rollinsville. North
winds gusted to 52 mph at Gage, Okla.
   Friday brought another day of record heat as downtown Los
Angeles had a high of 100 degrees, breaking the date's record of 88
set in 1904 and tied in 1962. The city reached a record-tying 100
on Tuesday and had record highs of 105 Wednesday and 106 Thursday.
   Record highs for the month were set at Ely, Nev., Phoenix, San
Francisco and San Jose, Calif.
   In contrast, a frost and freeze warning was in effect for parts
of the mountains and foothills of North Carolina.
   The high for the nation Friday was 112 degrees at Palm Springs,
Calif.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
across the Tennessee Valley, the central Gulf Coast states and
western North Carolina; rain from Virginia to New York; snow,
sometimes mixed with rain, in the Great Lakes region, the upper
Ohio Valley, the northern and central Appalachians, New England,
Wyoming and northern Colorado; snow in Montana and western South
Dakota; and gusty northerly winds in the upper and middle
Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were expected in the 30s and 40s from Montana
across the northern half of the Plains and Mississippi Valley, the
Great Lakes region and much of the Ohio Valley to New England; in
the 70s and 80s from southwest Oregon across Nevada, and much of
Texas to parts of Louisiana; in the 70s from Mississippi to
Florida; and in the 90s from California across southern Arizona and
southern New Mexico to southwest Texas, with 100- to 108-degree
readings in the deserts of southwest Arizona and southeast
California. Much of the rest of the nation was expected to have
highs in the 50s and 60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m EDT ranged from 11
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 90 at Blythe, Calif.

<HEAD>Study Links Low Cholesterol in Some Men to Greater Cancer Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new medical study says a low-fat diet may not be
healthy for everyone and that a 12-year survey shows low
cholesterol levels coincide with an increased risk of cancer in
some men.
   The researchers reported in the weekly British Medical Journal,
published Friday, that their results also show people with high
cholesterol have a greater chance of getting heart disease. That
finding has been confirmed by other scientific teams and gained
widespread public acceptance.
   However, the latest team of researchers said their results also
show that low cholesterol levels sometimes coincide with a greater
risk from cancer, although this link was only significant for men.
   They said they could not explain why these people are more at
risk from cancer. They said the lower cholesterol itself could be
the culprit, but that something else may be the cause instead.
   The study is not the first to find a link between lower
cholesterol and higher cancer risk. Some researchers have suggested
lower cholesterol levels are in fact the product of undiagnosed
bowel cancers, because developing tumors trap cholesterol and
remove it from blood.
   While the issue remains unsettled, many other scientists doubt
high cholesterol levels help prevent cancer.
   The report said the survey was conducted among 15,262 people _
7,000 men and 8,262 women aged 45 to 64 in industrial southwestern
Scotland.
   The scientists said they found the most convincing link for lung
cancer. ``The inverse association between cholesterol concentration
and cancer in men was strongest for lung cancer.''
   The research team was comprised Victor M. Hawthorne of the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor; Christopher G. Isles and
Anthony F. Lever, both of the blood pressure unit at the Western
Infirmary at Glasgow in southwest Scotland; and Charles R. Gillis
and David J. Hole, both of the cancer surveillance unit at
Glasgow's Ruchill Hospital.
   The team said more research is needed in the area.
   But, it added, ``We conclude that it may be a mistake to assume
that dietary advice given to the general population to reduce the
intake of saturated fat will necessarily reduce overall mortality.''
   Low-fat diets help reduce cholesterol. The team said such diets
are probably a good idea for people with high cholesterol levels.
   Their advice, however, was contradicted by Michael O'Connor,
director of the London-based Coronary Prevention Group:
   O'Connor told the British domestic news agency Press Association
in an interview: ``I do not believe this single research study
provides a proper basis on which to change well-established medical
advice to eat less saturated fat.''
   He said a 1,300-page study by the U.S. National Academy of
Sciences, released last month, showed there is no relationship
between low cholesterol and cancer.
   ``Our advice would be that people should eat less saturated fat
if they want to live longer.''
   Boston University microbiologist Selwyn Broitman told the
American Cancer Society's science writers' seminar in Irvine,
Calif., on Tuesday that he has found bowel cancer can lower
cholesterol in rats.
   A long-term study of residents of Framingham, Mass., revealed
some people have low levels of cholesterol and an above-average
risk of colon cancer, said John Laszlo, the American Cancer
Society's senior vice president for research.
   But he said studies of entire populations in several nations
show that people who eat high-fat, high-cholesterol diets tend to
have a higher incidence of both heart disease and colon cancer.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Tells Thatcher Risk of Contamination From Sub Slight</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Soviet Sub, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher early today that the risk of explosion
or contamination from a Soviet sub that sank off Norway was
``negligible,'' her office said.
   The Soviet leader also assured Mrs. Thatcher that the reactors
on the nuclear-powered submarine had been shut down before the
vessel caught fire and sank 312 miles off northern Norway, the
prime minister's office said.
   Gorbachev sent the message by telephone from his private office
in Moscow a few hours after he returned to Moscow from a two-day
visit to London where he held wide-ranging talks with Mrs.
Thatcher, her office said.
   Office staff at 10 Downing Street said it understood similar
messages from Gorbachev's office were sent to President Bush and
Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland.
   The Soviet leader told Mrs. Thatcher that there had been loss of
life but gave no figures, Downing Street said. Reports indicate at
least 12 crew are dead of the estimated 95 crew that were on board
the ``Mike'' class sub.
   In response, Mrs. Thatcher's office said it conveyed to
Gorbachev ``her condolences and sympathy for the families of those
who lost their lives in the accident.''
   The Soviet Union said today that the submarine sank in
international waters 110 miles southwest of Bear Island in the
Norwegian Sea. The Tass news agency said a rescue operation was
under way for other crewmen.
   ``Specialists ruled out the possibility of a radioactive
contamination of the environment,'' Tass said.

<HEAD>Investigators Say Missed Communication May Have Led To Train Wreck</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMPORIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Amtrak Silver Star's engineer was not
told that his train was about to switch tracks when he barreled
into the switching area at about 60 mph, investigators said.
   ``There definitely was a misunderstanding about when the train
was to switch tracks,'' said John Drake, head of the CSX Corp.
regional office in Florence, S.C.
   He said the company trainmaster at the switching area radioed
CSX central dispatch in Jacksonville, Fla., that the train should
switch back to the northbound tracks at the Trego switching area.
   The dispatcher in Jacksonville agreed to the move, and the
trainmaster manually threw the switch to divert the train to the
northbound tracks.
   Andrea Just of CSX's Baltimore office said tape recordings show
the dispatcher never notified the engineer that he was going to be
switching tracks at Trego.
   The derailment Thursday sent 34 people to area hospitals. The
wreck caused about $1.8 million in damage to the train and track.
   Gordon J. Inglis, the National Transportation Safety Board's
chief inspector, said it could be days before officials find out
the exact cause of the accident. Federal authorities said all crew
members have been tested for drug and alcohol use, but results were
not immediately available.
   The Silver Star, carrying 519 passengers, was traveling north
Thursday when it was switched to a southbound track because work
was being done on the northbound track. Both train engines and six
of the train's 18 cars left the track at the switching area.
   Of the 34 who had minor injuries, 33 were passengers.
   Clifford Black, an Amtrak spokesman in Washington, said the
injuries included sore necks and backs, and minor cuts.
   He said the track was reopened Friday and trains were back on
normal schedule.

   Five bombs believed to have been planted
by Basque separatists exploded early today at a railroad line,
officials said. The attacks follow a three-month truce and could
signal a new round of Basque violence.
   The explosives went off at two points at the railway in the
northern Navarre region, damaging tracks and a power substation,
officials said. No injuries were reported.
   Two hours before the predawn blasts, a man telephoned a local
travelers' aid bureau and said the Basque separatist organization,
known by its Basque initials ETA, had placed several bombs on the
rail line that were to explode within a few hours, the civil
governor's office said.
   The bombings represent the first attacks linked to ETA since
Jan. 8, when the group called a halt to attacks in exchange for
peace talks with the government. The group wants independence for
the three-province northern Basque region, but the government says
it will only talk when ETA ceases fighting.
   ETA broke off its talks with Spanish officials in Algiers,
Algeria, earlier this week, claiming the government of Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez had reneged on terms for more talks and a
prolonged halt on anti-government attacks.
   Also today, police were investigating a mail bomb that exploded
Friday in an apartment in the northern Basque town of Irun,
seriously injuring a 27-year-old man.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility. Authorities said
they had not ruled out the possibility that ETA was behind it.
   Since beginning its 21-year campaign for Basque
self-determination, ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more
than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers.

<HEAD>Museum Rejects Indian Claim on Sacred Bundle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Museum of Natural History has
refused to give a more than 150-year-old relic to a Cree Indian who
ran 2,700 miles in his quest to retrieve the sacred object for his
people.
   Museum spokesman Herbert Kurz said Friday that the museum sent a
letter to Jim Thunder's home in Edmonton, Canada, notifying him of
the museum's decision.
   Thunder said he was a great-great-grandson, through adoption, of
Chief Big Bear, the Cree leader who created the artifact _ a sacred
calico-wrapped bundle holding bear claws, sweet grass and a plug of
tobacco. It was meant to give his people spiritual strength and
guidance.
   Thunder said Big Bear told him ten years ago, through dreams and
visions, to retrieve the bundle and take it to his tribe in Western
Canada where it would be used in prayers and sacred Indian
ceremonies.
   Told of the museum's refusal to give him the bundle, Thunder
said: ``I had been anticipating this.''
   He declined to say if he would continue efforts to retrieve the
artifact.
   Thunder, 38, arrived in New York March 21 after a run across
Canada, beginning in Edmonton Sept. 1, to draw attention to his
mission.
   In New York, he met with museum officials and formally requested
that the Cree artifact be returned.
   Big Bear made the bundle when he was about 13 years old and
later wore it into battle for protection and guidance.
   A son of Big Bear _ Joe Pimi, who was also known as Horse Child
_ sought out a museum anthropologist who was leading an expedition
into central Canada and on Sept. 10, 1934, presented it to the
museum for safekeeping, the museum said.
   Since then, it has been available only to researchers, scholars
and American Indians. It has never been on public display.
   In rejecting Thunder's claim, Stanley A. Freed, a museum curator
who met with Thunder, wrote in his letter to Thunder ``it is our
responsibility to honor (Pimi's) wish.'' Freed also noted that
other Cree Indians claim they are entitled to the bundle.

<TEXT>
   A masked gunman killed a judge in a
courthouse annex and critically wounded a police officer before he
was fatally wounded in a shootout, authorities said.
   Police said they have no motive in Friday's shootings.
   Killed was Justice of the Peace Jack Dooley, 79. Assistant
Police Chief Emmitt Greene was shot in the chest, said Police Chief
Don Gullett. Greene was in serious condition Friday night at
Matagorda General Hospital in Bay City.
   The gunman was identified as Duc Nga Nguyen, 27, from Garden
City, Kan.
   Nguyen had been at the annex earlier in the day inquiring about
obtaining a driver's license and left when he was told they were
only issued on Wednesday.
   Nguyen returned later wearing a cap and a bandanna over his
face, said Gullett. Nguyen also wore a backpack that, police later
learned, contained adhesive tape, string and a device that could be
used as a bomb detonator. The pack also contained three pairs of
fake handcuffs.
   Pam Gullett, the police chief's wife who works for the county
tax office, said she knew there was something wrong as soon as
Nguyen walked in.
   ``He yelled at me to stand up. I asked him what he said, and
then the shooting started,'' she said. ``I ducked into a corner,
hoping that the bullets wouldn't go through the wood.''
   Dooley walked in as Nguyen grabbed a 32-year-old man, who was
standing by the door, authorities said.
   ``Judge Jack Dooley came upon them, he (Nguyen) looked at him,
pointed a gun and shot him once in the heart,'' said Matagorda
County Sheriff Sam Hurta.
   After the shot was fired, Greene ordered Nguyen to drop the gun,
but Nguyen began firing. Greene was hit in the chest, but was able
to reload his .45-caliber revolver and kill the gunman.
   ``About 18 to 20 rounds were exchanged,'' Gullett said.
   Police said Nguyen had been arrested in Palacios in 1987 for
carrying a pistol. Palacios is on the Texas Gulf Coast about 100
miles southwest of Houston.

<TEXT>
   South Africa, Angola and Cuba gathered
for emergency talks today in a bid to halt the fighting
jeopardizing Namibia's independence plan, which one official
described as all but suspended.
   Officials from the three nations, along with U.S. and Soviet
observers, planned daylong talks at an undisclosed site north of
Windhoek.
   Battles between the South African-led security forces and black
nationalist guerrillas occurred for an eighth straight day today,
police said.
   At least 262 guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's
Organization and 28 members of the security forces have been killed
in the heaviest fighting of the territory's 23-year war, police
said.
   SWAPO officials outside Namibia have disputed the figures and
say many civilians also have been killed.
   South Africa called on the guerrillas to surrender by midday
today or face intensified security-force action, but there was ``no
indication whatsoever'' that SWAPO planned to lay down arms as the
deadline passed, police Chief Inspector Derek Brune said.
   The South African-installed administrator of the territory,
Louis Pienaar, said Friday there was a ``de facto suspension'' of
the U.N. independence plan because of the widespread fighting near
Namibia's northern border with Angola. He said elections planned
for November could be affected by the conflict.
   Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, said he had informed
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar about a South
African decision to activate an unspecified number of additional
soldiers. A major reason for the move, Botha said, was that some
guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization were
approaching areas where white farmers lived.
   The United Nations has allowed South Africa to move a limited
number of army troops from their bases to support anti-guerrilla
police units, but Botha said Friday that the security forces ``at
the present level are not able to stem the incursion.''
   Botha emphasized that South Africa remained committed to
implementing independence in Namibia and that the U.N. plan had not
been formally suspended. The U.N. Security Council said Friday it
was satisfied that South Africa still sought to grant independence
to the territory it has ruled since World War I.
   After six months of an informal cease-fire, the fighting began
April 1, the day the U.N. independence plan and a formal cease-fire
took effect.
   South Africa claims SWAPO has sent more than 1,900 guerrillas
into northern Namibia since April 1 in violation of an accord
requiring the insurgents to remain at bases at least 100 miles away
in Angola.
   Col. Herman du Plessis, a territorial army officer, said an
additional 1,300 guerrillas were in southern Angola near the
Namibian border and were ``an immediate threat.'' SWAPO leaders
contend most of the guerrillas had been in Namibia for some time
and have no intention of leaving for Angola.
   Some U.N. officials have suggested that SWAPO field commanders
mistakenly thought their units could return unmolested to Namibia
as of April 1 and set up bases. Several captured guerrillas have
said they returned to Namibia in search of U.N. personnel and
expected no confrontations with the security forces.
   The U.N. has authorized 4,650 troops for Namibia, but less than
1,000 have arrived. Of that total, the only forces in the northern
battle areas as of Saturday were about 300 logistical personnel.
   SWAPO has been favored to win the most votes in pre-independence
elections planned for November under the U.N. plan.
   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December when
South Africa, Angola and Cuba signed an accord calling for
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops who have helped Marxist Angola
battle U.S.-backed rebels.

will be real effects,'' Walesa said.
   The Sejm, or parliament, passed bills Friday that enacted
economic and political agreements approved by Walesa and the
interior minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, after two months of talks
between authorities and the opposition.
   The laws allow restoration of Solidarity, which was banned after
the December 1981 martial law crackdown, give Poland its first free
elections since World War II, and create the post of presidency.
   The new parliament will consist of two chambers: a newly created
100-member Senate and a 460 member Sejm. Elections to the Senate
will be freely contested while the communist party and its allies
will be assured 65 percent of the Sejm with 35 percent reserved for
independent, non-party candidates.
   ``We should try to win in the elections to the Sejm and the
Senate, win on the social side because it would be very bad if we
retreated from the field and were unable to cultivate those limited
possibilities,'' Walesa said.
   He said the Citizens Committee should be formalized so that it
could ask future opposition legislators to speak on behalf of
Solidarity.
   The meeting was also expected to consider potential opposition
candidates for the elections scheduled for June. In the past,
Solidarity urged election boycotts to express disapproval of
authorities' policies.
   The boycott appeals and public dissatisfication led to
increasingly low voter turnouts and finally to the devastating
rejection of a government referendum on economic reform in November
1987.
   The opposition agreed to participate in elections during the
round-table talks in exchange for the restoration of Solidarity's
legal status.
   While the opposition will field candidates for parliament, it
has expressed reluctance to enter the government where the Polish
United Workers (communist) Party and its allies still would have a
majority of ministers.
   Authorities first proposed talks with the opposition on
political and economic reform during the second nationwide wave of
strikes in August.
   Walesa refused talks until authorities agreed to accept a legal
Solidarity. The go-ahead came when the communist party approved
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's recommendation to restore Solidarity at
a party plenum in January.

<HEAD>Democrat Readies Ethics Complaint Against Gingrich</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arkansas Democrat will file a formal
complaint next week that House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich
allegedly violated nine House rules.
   Rep. Bill Alexander circulated the complaint he drew up among
his Democratic colleagues on Friday, Alexander spokesman Lee Powell
said.
   Under House rules, the formal filing of such a complaint by
Alexander will force the ethics committee to take a vote on whether
to launch an investigation of Gingrich, a Georgia Republican.
   Alexander's action was seen as the beginning of a Democratic
counteroffensive against Gingrich, who last year filed the ethics
complaint that resulted in a lengthy investigation of Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas.
   The ethics committee, known formally as the House Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, is nearing the conclusion of its
investigation of Wright and is expected to decide as early as next
week whether to charge him with violations of House rules.
   Allegations in Alexander's complaint center on an unusual
promotional deal for Gingrich's 1984 book, ``Window of
Opportunity.''
   The deal involved 21 investors who put $5,000 each into a
partnership formed to promote the book. In return for their
investment, the partners were promised half the publisher's
profits, but the publisher ended up losing money on the book and
the investors got a tax writeoff.

<TEXT>
   A coalition of conservation groups are asking
President Bush to withdraw his nomination of James Cason to oversee
the Forest Service because of what they call Cason's ``wanton
insensitivity'' toward the environment.
   The groups on Friday detailed a series of complaints about
actions Cason took as an acting assistant secretary at the Interior
Department.
   They said he had ``improperly'' applied pressure on the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service to keep the spotted owl off the
endangered species list and ordered the destruction of a Bureau of
Land Management draft report that said the owl was threatened by
logging in the ancient forests of the Northwest.
   The groups also said Cason had attempted to stop the Forest
Service from carrying out a congressional mandate to publish
regulations governing oil and gas leases in national forests and
was responsible for mismanaging an Office of Surface Mining permit
system that resulted in the waste of millions of taxpayer dollars.

   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, will file a
report required by federal law stating that the East German
government paid for one night's lodging at a conference he attended
in June 1987.
   Cohen was one of at least a handful of members of the House and
Senate who neglected to report travel expenses picked up by foreign
governments as required under the 1978 Foreign Gifts and
Decorations Act, The Associated Press reported this week.
   Several lawmakers said they were unaware of the law or confused
about its requirements. It calls for any gifts or travel expenses
paid by foreign governments to be reported on a form. Senators must
report gifts over $100; House members have a ceiling of $180.
   Cohen's spokeswoman, Kathy Gest, said on Friday that information
just received from the American Embassy in East Germany indicated
the cost of the hotel was $132.40, $32.40 over the $100 filing
limit. As a result, she said, Cohen would file under the foreign
gifts act.

<TEXT>
   A nuclear-powered Soviet submarine caught
fire and sank in international waters off northern Norway, and
Norwegian officials said today that at least 12 crew members were
killed.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent messages to the prime
ministers of Norway and Britain saying that an undetermined number
of sailors died in the accident Friday and that the nuclear
reactors on the submarine had been shut down before the vessel
sank, officials and news reports said.
   ``According to the opinion of experts, the possibility of a
nuclear explosion and radioactive pollution of the environment is
excluded,'' Gorbachev's message to Norway's premier said, according
to the NTB news agency.
   Officials in Washington said it was probably a ``Mike'' class
submarine, one of the most modern in the Soviet fleet, and capable
of carrying 95 sailors.
   They said the sub, which was designed to hunt and destroy other
submarines in the event of war, is powered by two nuclear
generators and can carry torpedoes and long-range ballistic
missiles.
   Vadime Rosanov, the Soviet press attache in Oslo, told Norwegian
television the sub was carrying torpedoes, not ballistic missiles.
However, he declined to say whether the vessel was equipped with
nuclear weapons.
   U.S. and Norwegian military sources, who reported the accident
before Soviet officials did, said the fire apparently broke out
while the vessel was underwater and that it surfaced before sinking.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass, which reported the sinking
19 hours after it occurred, said: ``The crew is being rescued by
Soviet vessels in the area. There has been loss of life.''
   Tass, which did not identify the submarine, said only that ``a
fire broke out on board a Soviet nuclear-powered torpedo
submarine'' Friday at 11:41 a.m. (3:41 a.m. EDT), and it sank at
5:15 p.m. (9:15 a.m. EDT).
   ``Specialists ruled out the possibility of a radioactive
contamination of the environment,'' Tass said.
   The Soviet defense minister, Dmitri T. Yazov, was quoted by Tass
as saying the crew fought the fire for several hours before
abandoning ship. He said a Soviet warship was taking survivers to
the Arctic port of Murmansk.
   Pictures taken Friday by Norwegian reconnaissance aircraft
showed about 13 Soviet sailors clinging in the sea to a life raft
thrown to them from the Norwegian aircraft. Norwegian officials
said the sub sank 120 miles south of Norway's Bear Island and 320
miles off the northern coast of Norway.
   ``The minimum number of casualties would be 12. It's difficult
to say and we don't know many were picked up,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Per
Andre Ragdem, spokesman for Norway's northern military command.
   He said the Soviets had declined offers of help from Norway.
   Gorbachev confirmed in a message to Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland that sailors died in the accident, but he didn't say how
many, NTB reported.
   Gorbachev, who ended a 40-hour visit to England on Friday,
assured Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain that the sub's
reactors had been shut down before the vessel caught fire and sank,
her office said today.
   If Western descriptions of the submarine are accurate, the
reactors are well-protected and carry less radioactive material
than in older submarines, said Johan Baarli, director of Norway's
Institute for Radiation Protection.
   He said any radioactive material probably would remain in the
submarine and not escape into the sea.
   Nevertheless, Anne Alvik, chairman of Norway's Committee on
Peacetime Nuclear Accidents, said nearby waters would be checked
for pollution.
   A Soviet cruiser of the ``Kirov'' class, equipped with hospital
facilities, was at the site of the accident, as well as Soviet
trawlers, Ragdem said. Norwegian coast guard vessels were also
headed for the area, he said.
   Norwegian and Swedish defense sources estimate the Soviet Union
has about 110 nuclear submarines operating in northern waters from
bases on the Kola Peninsula, one of the world's heaviest
concentrations of naval power.
   The ``Mike'' might carry 16 missiles for surface targets,
although the figure is unconfirmed, said Swedish Defense Ministry
spokesman Thomas Gur.
   Scores of crew members have been reported killed in previous
Soviet submarine accidents. In 1983, a Soviet submarine sank in the
northern Pacific, killing 90 crew members, according to U.S.
intelligence officials.

   More than 100 state and local officials
using search dogs and a helicopter nabbed a fourth escapee early
this morning, hours after 13 inmates broke out of an overcrowded
county jail.
   Two inmates were captured late Friday after escaping from the
Norfolk County House of Corrections, state police said. A third
inmate was found today in the cellar of a home and a fourth was
arrested near downtown Quincy.
   The inmates were discovered missing during a 9:30 p.m. head
count and may have escaped about 8 p.m, state police Sgt. Peter
Quinn said. Authorities believe they escaped by cutting through a
jail wall.
   State troopers said they were concentrating their search for the
remaining inmates in the South Boston, Roxbury and Hyde Park
sections of Boston where many of the men are from.
   The inmates were clad in green prison garb.
   The Dedham jail is one of the most overcrowded prisons in the
state. It was the scene of a disturbance in February when a fight
among more than 100 inmates broke out in the recreation room and
several small fires were set.
   At the time, there were 262 prisoners in the jail that was has a
federally set limit of 172. The sheriff has received special
permission that allows the extra prisoners at the jail.
   Dedham prison officials declined to say how many are in the jail
now.
   ``Certainly the overcrowding is excessive,'' said state Rep.
Marie-Louise Kehoe, D-Dedham. She said the federal cap was the
result of a lawsuit filed by inmates about four years ago.
   ``But please understand that originally, when the jail was
constructed, it was built to accommodate 72,'' Kehoe said.

   Twenty-eight single women golfers have
sued a country club that they claim charged them thousands of
dollars more for memberships than single men were charged.
   The lawsuit filed Friday says the Newport Beach Country Club
charged single women members up to $8,500 more than men for the
same type of membership.
   The women were told in an April letter that they could convert
their ``single lady'' memberships to charter member status for
$3,000 or to founding member status for $12,000.
   Previous policies allowed single men to become charter members
for no additional charge or founding members for $3,500, according
to the lawsuit filed by attorney Gloria Allred.
   Clubhouse manager Jackie Morrissey declined to comment.
   The lawsuit also claimed that women were required to pay guest
fees for male guests while men frequently were not charged for
female guests. Also, men receive free refreshments in their locker
room but women were required to pay, it said.

   Flooding in Iran swamped dozens of
villages in a province near the Afghan border and forced thousands
of people to flee, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Saturday.
   No deaths have been reported, an unidentified official at the
prime minister's office told IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   Flood waters inundated 35 villages in Sistan-Baluchistan
province, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to
farms, bridges, highways and buidings, he said.
   About 6,600 flood victims have been evacuated and military units
are still trying to rescue people from the inundated villages.
Boats, helicopters and an airplane worked around the clock to save
human lives, he said.
   The flood was caused by the unusual rise in the Hirmand and
Paryian rivers in southeast Iran, IRNA said. The report did not say
when the flooding began or what caused the rivers to swell.

   Protesters hurled rocks and
bottles and attacked police with nails outside a village meeting
hall where members of the ultra-right Republicans Party held a
rally, officials said Saturday.
   Police said 17 people were injured and seven protesters were
arrested in the clashes Friday night in Grossostheim, a village
outside Aschaffenburg, about 25 miles southeast of Frankfurt.
   Officials said protesters smashed store windows and damaged
police vehicles.
   The violence erupted after about 500 demonstrators broke off
from a peaceful protest attended by about 1,400 people and marched
toward the building where the Republicans' rally drew 1,300, police
said.
   A police spokesman in Aschaffenburg, who declined to be named
under department rules, said the protesters included ``professional
rowdies who travel around to violently disrupt meetings.''
   Left-wing organizations accuse the Republicans of being
neo-fascist and hostile toward West Germany's millions of foreign
workers and immigrants.
   The party won a surprising 7.5 percent of the vote in West
Berlin elections in January.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conversations begin tentatively,
but the fears and frustrations of the past 11 years soon come
tumbling out.
   It is the weariness that is most striking: weariness of war,
weariness of a police state, weariness of what is perceived as the
world's indifference to the superpower game being played in
Afghanistan.
   ``Other countries like to watch us Afghans, like we watch our
dogfights, and think, `Oh, the Afghans are killing each other
again,'' said a Kabul university professor who has studied in
Western Europe.
   Kabul dogfights, which are a bit like canine wrestling matches,
are seldom fatal. But the war between the Kabul government, backed
until earlier this year by Soviet troops, and Western-backed Moslem
guerrillas has claimed an estimated 1 million lives since the
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan took power by coup and
assassination in 1978.
   The United Nations has estimated at least 5 million Afghans have
fled the country since then, leaving a population of about 10
million.
   ``People are dying and suffering every day,'' the professor
said, speaking on condition he not be identified further. ``It is
not human to just be an observer.
   ``The world is silent. We are silent. We have had to learn the
science of being alive. I did not join the (communist) party. The
politics of silence I was following.''
   The professor spoke of the frustration of not being able to find
out what was happening in his own country, what Washington and
Moscow might be contemplating, what fighting was going on in other
parts of the country.
   ``We used to read the Far Eastern Economic Review, Le Monde.
They come no more,'' he said. He said he distrusted the local
government-controlled news media.
   Across town, a silver merchant also criticized what he
considered the superpowers' abandonment of responsibility.
   ``The Americans, the Russians think they are finished. In
Geneva, they make writings on paper. They say they finish this
problem,'' he said. ``But this problem is not finished. It is
worse, not better.''
   Under a U.N.-sponsored accord signed in Geneva April 14, 1988,
the Soviet Union withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan
on Feb. 15 of this year. But Moscow continues to arm its proteges,
and the United States says it cannot abandon the guerrillas, who
call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   ``You give bombs to the mujahedeen,'' the silver merchant told
an American reporter. ``The Russians give bombs to the government.
You don't die. Russians don't die. Only Afghan people die. Maybe it
is time for us to say, `OK, finished. President Najib is not so
bad. Let us have a quick finish.''
   ``The people are weary, especially in Kabul when they hear of
Jalalabad,'' said a 41-year-old man. His niece and her three
children were killed last week while trying to leave Jalalabad,
about 40 miles from the Pakistan border, where the guerrillas have
besieged government troops for the past month.
   He said his relatives were traveling in an army-escorted convoy
that was attacked by the mujahedeen. Others, too, were killed, he
said, but he did not know the numbers.
   ``There are problems, because the main roads are going to be
closed by the mujahedeen,'' he added.
   Kabul has already felt the effects of closed roads. Food and
fuel supplies have been curtailed since January, as mujahedeen
forces and snowfalls blocked highways.
   Although the situation has eased with airlifts of flour and
wheat from the Soviet Union and weekly food and medicine flights
from India, the poorest people of Kabul still spend hours getting
bread from little bakery stalls dotted around the city. Some send
their children in relays to await the crisp slabs of freshly baked
nan, the bread that is the staple of the Afghan diet.
   Traffic on the streets of Kabul remains light, one-fourth or
less of what it was last fall, because of gasoline rationing.
   ``The petrol pumps are open if you have the piece of paper from
the government,'' said a shopkeeper who owns a car. ``If you want
the paper, it may take three or four days. I would have to close my
shop for three or four days. I have 10 children, and I must keep my
shop open. I walk.''

<TEXT>
   It was meant to be a week of
celebration, a joyous confirmation that long-delayed independence
finally was on its way.
   Instead, the bloodiest fighting of Namibia's 23-year bush war
erupted, making a mockery of a cease-fire, jeopardizing the
credibility of a U.N. monitoring operation, and killing scores of
young guerrillas before they could savor the independence for which
they fought.
   In the war-ravaged northern region of Ovambo, where most of the
insurgents' supporters live, a dusk-to-dawn curfew is back in force
after a seven-week lull, and deep-rooted cynicism about the
prospects for independence from South Africa has returned.
   ``Namibian soil now bleeds when in fact (the people) should be
rejoicing,'' said the Namibian Council of Churches.
   There is agreement on what prompted the clashes _ the presence
of hundreds of well-armed South-West Africa People's Organization
guerrillas in northern Namibia on April 1, the day that the
U.N.-supervised truce was to have taken effect.
   But why it happened _ after six months without major hostilities
_ remains in dispute. Why would SWAPO risk confrontation on the
very day that an 11-year-old independence plan was implemented,
calling for elections which the guerrilla movement was favored to
win?
   South Africa, Namibia's ruler since World War I, says the
guerrillas staged a cross-border incursion while they were supposed
to have been at least 100 miles inside Angola as part of an
agreement to confine combatants from both sides to their bases.
   SWAPO's aim, said South African Foriegn Minister Pik Botha, was
to set up bases after the cease-fire had neutralized security
forces, and then proclaim to the world that the bases were
established through military prowess.
   SWAPO's president, Sam Nujoma, says most of the guerrillas
involved in the fighting had been in Namibia all along and were
prepared to place themselves under U.N. control on April 1. The
insurgents thought they would be safe once the truce started and
did not expect to be hunted down by military-style police units,
other SWAPO officials said.
   Villagers in Ovambo have recounted how cheerful SWAPO guerrillas
seemed to be expecting a hero's welcome rather than a war when they
arrived.
   Officials from the United Nations, the United States, Britain
and elsewhere have supported South Africa's assertion that the
guerrillas did infiltrate from Angola. SWAPO had no known bases in
Namibia, and Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the monitoring
force, said the U.N. plan made no provisions for such bases.
   Botha boasted during the week that South Africa's international
image had been enhanced by the Namibian crisis, while SWAPO had
been discredited.
   Even the Organization of African Unity and the front-line states
of southern Africa, two persistent critics of Botha's government,
refrained from attacking South Africa when they issued statements
of concern about Namibia.
   However, African nations expressed sympathy for SWAPO and
accused the United Nations of incompetence.
   The leaders of the U.N. monitoring force have encountered
particularly harsh criticism for allowing South African military
units to leave their bases and join police in anti-guerrilla
operations.
   The Namibian Council of Churches, in a report based on a visit
by clergymen to the war zone, said that when Ovambo residents in
the north tried to report incidents, two U.N. officers refused to
stop reading their novels and a third ``was intoxicated and of no
help at all.''
   During the week of combat, less than 1,000 soldiers of the
planned 4,650-member U.N. military monitoring force were in
Namibia, and only a handful of observers were in Ovambo. SWAPO and
its Third World allies had insisted even this full figure was
inadequate and called for the United Nations to expand the force to
7,500, as was originally planned.
   A major question now is whether any reconciliation can be
achieved if the independence plan is able to proceed.
   SWAPO had been favored to gain the most votes in
pre-independence elections scheduled for November, and the fighting
does not appear to have dampened its support in Ovambo, where about
half of Namibia's 1.3 million people live.
   But elsewhere, parties opposed to SWAPO hope to capitalize on
what they view as a huge blunder by the guerrillas. Leaders of the
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, which depicts itself a moderate
alternative to SWAPO, said its supporters could be drawn into
conflict with SWAPO backers because of the fighting in the north.
   Thornberry, at one of several hectic news briefings during the
week, said Namibia ``is in danger of bleeding to death.''

prompted authorities to send in tanks and troops:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Georgia is in the Caucasus Mountains in the southern
Soviet Union north of Turkey. It is bordered by Russia, Armenia and
Azerbaijan and at 27,000 square miles, it is smaller than South
Carolina. It includes the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic on the
Black Sea coast, the Ajar Autonomous Republic and the South
Ossetian Autonomous Region.

   THE PEOPLE _ About 70 percent of the republic's 5.3 million
people are Georgian. Among minority ethnic groups, 9 percent are
Armenian, 7 percent Russian, 5 percent Azerbaijanis and 1.7 percent
Abkhazian.

   POLITICAL STATUS _ Georgia is one of the 15 republics making up
the Soviet Union and activists are calling for secession. Abkhazia
is an ``autonomous republic'' under the authority of Georgia;
activists there want it to become a 16th republic of the Soviet
Union.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Georgia is one of the oldest nations in the Soviet
Union, with records dating back to the 3rd century B.C. It became
Christian in A.D. 318. It became a part of the Russian empire in
1800 to gain protection from the Persians. It became part of the
Soviet Union in 1921.
   In 1956, dozens of people were killed when Soviet troops fired
on a memorial march for the late dictator Josef Stalin, who was a
Georgian.
   In April 1978 in Tbilisi, about 5,000 people marched in protest
of plans to drop Georgian as the state language of the republic.
The plans were dropped.

   ABKHAZIA _ The small subtropical resort area is located on the
Black Sea in northwest Georgia on the border with the Russian
republic. Abkhazians number just 15 percent or 91,000 of its total
population of 505,000, and they are outnumbered by both Georgians
and Russians in their homeland.
   Abkhazians have complained for years that Georgians have
interfered with their national life, but Georgians complain of
discrimination in Abkhazia. In 1978, 12,000 people gathered in
village of Lichni to demand that Abkhazia be allowed to secede from
Georgia and join the Russian republic. The demand was refused, and
the local party leader was dismissed.

<HEAD>Congress to Oil Industry: Be Prepared</HEAD>

   Government and industry were caught unprepared
when the Exxon Valdez spilled 10 million gallons of crude oil into
Prince William Sound, and Congress is determined not to let it
happen again.
   In response to the worst oil spill in North American history,
lawmakers are scrutinizing federal statutes related to oil
transportation so no future spill is allowed to get so far out of
control.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has introduced
legislation that would require the president to immediately
initiate a cleanup of oil spills unless he is sure the owner or
operator of the vessel is doing it.
   President Bush announced Friday he was sending the military to
Valdez to help clean up, but Mitchell was angry that he waited
until two weeks after the March 24 accident to take any action.
   ``A federal takeover of the cleanup effort was warranted after
it became clear on the day of the accident that Alyeska (the oil
pipeline service company) and Exxon had not responded in the manner
called for by the contingency plan and did not have sufficient
equipment available to contain the spill,'' Mitchell said.
   His proposal would set up a $500 million federal fund to pay for
the spills when those responsible can't be found.
   Both Mitchell's bill and one offered by Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., are amendments to the Clean Water Act.
   Baucus is proposing that minimum penalties for spilling oil be
increased from $5,000 to $50,000 and, in the case of big spills, to
$50 per barrel. That would have slapped a multi-million dollar fine
on Exxon for the Valdez accident.
   House Republicans also are working on legislation to improve
readiness for oil tanker accidents, but don't want the federal
government to get stuck with the bill.
   The measure being designed by the House Republican Research
Committee would require industry to be more specific about
emergency response plans and have more equipment ready, as well as
to pay for all the costs of cleanup.
   Legislation proposed by Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C., would
consolidate four federal laws on who gets blamed and billed for
damage caused by spills.
   His proposal also would increase liability, the categories for
which compensation should be paid and the size of the fund for
making compensation. Money for the fund would come from a
1.3-cent-per-barrel fee on crude oil sold in the United States.
   Jones' subcommittee on the Coast Guard will be working on
legislation reauthorizing that service and likely will make changes
reflecting reaction to the Valdez disaster, said a staff member of
the subcommittee.
   Cornel Martin noted that the bill could be a vehicle for
strengthening rules against alcohol consumption by tanker crews, or
requiring more extensive background checks on those renewing their
pilot's licenses.
   The pilot of the Exxon Valdez, who was in his cabin when the
tanker ran aground, admitted drinking before the accident and, as a
motorist, had a history of driving while intoxicated arrests. He
has been charged in the accident.
   Both Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Rep. Silvio Conte,
R-Mass., have introduced bills that would give the Coast Guard
access to the Federal National Driver Register to check on driving
records of potential tanker pilots.
   Lawmakers opposed to oil exploration in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge say there's not much chance of legislation passing
that would allow drilling in that environmentally sensitive Alaskan
region.
   ``ANWR is dead for the foreseeable future,'' said Sen. Timothy
Wirth, D-Colo.
   But Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who supports ANWR drilling,
disagrees.
   ``It is too early too tell what the impact will be,'' he said.
``We will have to assess not only what the damage is, but ways to
prevent this kind of accident in the future and to assure the
public that can be done. The spill does not reduce our need for
oil.''
   Bush's budget for fiscal 1990 assumed the treasury would get
$2.1 billion from oil lease sales in the refuge.
   Since the Valdez disaster, White House and congressional budget
negotiators have decided the money won't be available.

   Tanks rumbled through thousands of people
demonstrating for independence in Soviet Georgia today, and the
republic's leaders discussed the crisis in a building besieged by
protesters, activists said.
   ``They went right through the crowd,'' Tamara Chiza,
correspondent for the unofficial journal Express-Khronika, said of
the tanks.
   She said five or six tanks pushed through the demonstrators in
downtown Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, in a show of force on the
fifth straight day of nationalists protests. She said the tanks did
not fire and the people refused to disperse, despite the presence
of several hundred soldiers.
   Another activist said about 10 people were injured and that some
protesters threw themselves in front of a tank.
   A journalist at the republic's official news agency, Gruzinform,
said the republic's leadership was meeting urgently in government
headquarters that were surrounded by the protesters. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Forces of the Soviet Interior Ministry moved into Tbilisi on
Friday after strikes and protests closed down much of the city.
Witnesses reported seeing tanks and armored personnel carriers as
well soldiers, but official sources said they had no knowledge of
tanks being deployed.
   Nationalists have been demonstrating and conducting a hunger
strike to demand independence and an end to what they consider
Kremlin interference in their dealings with the Abkhazia region of
Georgia. They barricaded themselves behind buses on Lenin Square in
front of government offices to prevent government tanks and troops
from breaking up their protests, activists said.
   In the first report on the unrest by the central press, the
government daily Izvestia did not mention calls for independence
but said ``anti-Soviet, anti-socialist'' slogans were seen at the
Tbilisi demonstrations.
   The report said the main goal of the Tbilisi protest was to
object to unspecified ``unconstitutional actions'' by Abkhazia
residents.
   That appeared to be a reference to calls by Abkhazians to secede
from Georgia and become a separate Soviet republic.
   In addition to pressing their independence demands, the Georgian
protesters claim the Kremlin is stirring up ethnic unrest in the
autonomous region of Abkhazia in their southern republic. Activists
reported clashes between Georgians and Abkhazians last weekend in
the Black Sea resort of Sukhumi.
   Several people said unrest began in the region when thousands of
Abkhazians, a small minority, gathered in the settlement of Lichni
two weeks ago to petition for Abkhazia to secede from Georgia and
become a republic.
   Ms. Chiza said in a telephone interview that most public
tranportation was not operating in Tbilisi today, and other sources
said only stores and food processing plants were open. ``The whole
city is paralyzed,'' she said.
   The crowd gathered in the square paralyzed traffic in the center
of the city of 1.2 million people.
   Earlier today, activist Sergei Dandurov estimated the number of
tanks at 10 and said they had injured eight or nine young people.
He said in a telephone call from Tbilisi that several people threw
themselves at the first tank, shouting, ``Death to the Russian
occupiers!''
   The unrest was the latest outpouring of nationalist feeling in
the Soviet Union, a country of more than 100 ethnic groups.
Tensions have run particularly high in the southern Caucasus, where
Georgia is located, because of earlier clashes between neighboring
Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   Georgy Chanturia, chairman of the National Democratic Party,
said Thursday that 158 Georgians began a hunger strike at
government buildings Tuesday and plan to continue it until April
14, the anniversary of a demonstration for ethnic rights in 1978.
He said they are demanding an independent Georgia.
   Last fall, demonstrators marched in Tbilisi with demands ranging
from Georgian independence to the manufacture of more
Georgian-language typewriters.
   Soviet authorities also responded to ethnic unrest in
neighboring Azerbaijan and Armenia with troops in the past year.
More than 90 people were killed in the ethnic clashes, mostly in
November, and those two republics remained under military control
and curfews for months.

<HEAD>Utah Legislature Approves $5 Million Request For Fusion Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seeing a potential bonanza if two
scientists' claims of a new way to create fusion prove true, the
Legislature voted to appropriate $5 million to accelerate the
research at the University of Utah.
   Following assurances from Gov. Norm Bangerter that he wasn't
asking for a blank check, the Legislature on Friday approved the
funds but stressed that no money would be spent until the
experiment was confirmed.
   Neither of the two researchers who claim to have produced
nuclear fusion in a test tube, Stanley Pons of Utah and Martin
Fleischmann of the University of Southampton in England, was
present.
   Bangerter and other officials say their claim, if true, could
bring the state millions of dollars in patent and licensing
royalties.
   ``I want the state to get going. We're not asking for a blank
check. We just want to be able to expedite the process so that it
can take us where it's going to take us,'' Bangerter told a joint
session of the Legislature.
   Lawmakers also passed legislation creating a nine-member state
Fusion Energy Advisory Council to oversee the research.
   They approved the two bills overwhelmingly after hearing
presentations from University of Utah President Chase Peterson and
members of the state Board of Regents.
   Fusion is the energy source that powers the sun and hydrogen
bombs. The energy produced by nuclear power plants comes from
fission, which splits atoms. During fusion, they are joined
together.
   Ordinarily, fusion requires extremely high heat. But Pons and
Fleischmann contend that they sustained a controlled fusion
reaction at room temperature, using materials found in any college
laboratory, and produced four times the amount of energy required
to run the experiment.
   Their findings were immediately cited by some as the door to a
long-range, safe, cheap energy source _ if they are confirmed by
other tests and transferred to a large-scale project.
   However, some scientists have said they cannot duplicate the
experiment and doubt its validity.
   Legislators stressed that no money would be spent until the
experiment is confirmed.
   ``If you're asking if there is a possibility of a runaway train,
we haven't even gotten the train to move yet,'' said House Majority
Leader Craig Moody. ``Before a single dime is spent, we have to
have fusion confirmed.''
   The appropriations bill allocates $2 million for the current
fiscal budget and $3 million for fiscal 1990, and authorizes the
new council to spend up to $300,000 for legal services, including
patent research.
   Attorney General Paul Van Dam told the body he needs at least
$75,000 immediately to hire international patent experts to advise
the state on how to protect the process.

   Back-to-back visits by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir have
restored U.S. momentum in the Middle East but the outlook for peace
talks is unclear until skeptical Palestinians decide their next
move.
   They are faced with the hard choice of electing leaders to
negotiate with an Israeli government that has ruled out statehood,
or using force and diplomacy to try to dislodge Israel from the
West Bank and Gaza.
   President Bush's endorsement of Shamir's proposal for elections
in the territories was coupled during the visits with a reiteration
of U.S. opposition to establishment of an independent Palestinian
state.
   These moves cheered the Shamir government, which had been urged
by the administration to come up with ``new ideas'' for dealing
with the 1.4 million Palestinians who have been under Israeli
control since 1967.
   While the details are not clear, the goal set by the prime
minister is a trial period of local self-rule, with negotiations on
a permanent settlement to be conducted afterward by Israel,
Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan.
   However, Bush also said Israel should end its occupation of the
territories and had no sovereignty claim to the land lost by the
Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day war. Bush's endorsement of Shamir's
election proposal tended to overshadow the strong statement, but it
registered on the Israeli government because it is an unqualified
demand.
   Previous administrations left open the possibility that Israel
might retain some of the land as a security zone while trading
territory for peace.
   Shamir reiterated his position that retention of the West Bank
is essential for Israel's security. His concern is not that a small
Palestinian state would overwhelm Israel militarily. Rather, a
close aide said, the Palestine Liberation Organization's stated
strategy is to gain a foothold on the West Bank and to trigger a
war between Israel and the Arab countries.
   The Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Arabs enjoy a 10-1 advantage in weapons, while Shamir stressed
in a speech Thursday that the most densely populated center of
Israel, without the West Bank, is as wide as the distance between
the White House and suburban Chevy Chase.
   ``The choice is not between Israel keeping the territories or
risking war,'' he said. ``The opposite is true. If we leave, there
will almost certainly be war.''
   At the end of Shamir's visit the Israeli delegation seemed
satisfied with the results. Privately, the official said, they had
told their American hosts at the start that the Bush administration
was drifting toward support of PLO positions and that Israel was
prepared to make a public issue of its concern.
   ``The critical thing to change is the signal the U.S. is sending
the Arabs,'' the official said. ``Both sides decided to find a
middle ground, and we found it.''
   Still, the Bush administration will keep talking to the PLO, to
the dismay of Israel, which accuses the group of unrelenting
terrorism. And Bush's statements on the West Bank and Gaza appear
to leave no room for compromise.
   Mubarak's visit, meanwhile, produced U.S. assurances that Bush
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III consider the situation in
the territories untenable. The Egyptian leader worked hard at
trying to convince them that an international peace conference
would instantly produce direct negotiations between Israel and the
Arabs.
   Bush gave the idea lukewarm endorsement, saying a conference
might help at the appropriate time and under the right
circumstances. More important, from Mubarak's viewpoint, the
president and Baker left no doubt the administration would not
permit the situation in the territories to stagnate.
   Bush underscored a need for ``creativity'' and ``imaginative
ways'' of rethinking the peace process.
   His exploration of the possibilities will resume April 19 with a
visit to Washington by King Hussein of Jordan. Over the long run,
though, the Palestinians' response to Shamir's proposal could hold
the key.
   Shamir said a majority of the Palestinians on the West Bank and
in Gaza want a peaceful settlement in preference to their 15{-month
bloody uprising. He also predicted they are likely to participate
in the election.
   Their initial response was a cool one, while PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat, on a visit to Congo, criticized the proposal as
inappropriate and said the uprising would continue ``until the
ultimate victory.''
   Hanna Sindora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr newspaper,
said, ``I think the intefadeh will continue until Shamir comes up
with a better proposal.''
   But Bush, declaring that ``the climate is better than it's been
for a while,'' said the election plan represents a welcome step
toward progress.
   ``In the Middle East, a little step sometimes can ... prove to
be fruitful,'' he said Friday.

   Laws approved by parliament this week have
ushered in a new era of competitive elections in Poland that will
break the communist party's long monopoly on power.
   The laws also created a new legislative chamber that will be the
East bloc's first such democratically elected body.
   Polish lawmakers passed their historic reforms Friday in a quick
series of votes as amendments to the constitution. They created a
presidency, a freely elected Senate, and new electoral laws.
   A Solidarity committee created by leader Lech Walesa plans to
meet today to discuss potential opposition candidates.
   The constitutional amendments follow major political reforms in
the Soviet Union, which last month held its first contested
elections in seven decades of communist rule. However, only
candidates approved by officially sanctioned groups were allowed to
run in the Soviet races.
   The bills stem from an agreement Wednesday in an
opposition-government committee on political reform. The group
formed part of two-month talks between the Solidarity-led
opposition and communist authorities.
   The opposition agreed to participate in the Sejm, or parliament,
in exchange for restoration of the legal status of the independent
trade union Solidarity. The union was banned after authorities
imposed martial law in December 1981.
   The amendments call for creating a 100-member Senate to be
freely elected in June.
   The Senate's primary function will be to act as a control on the
Sejm, especially ``in the field of human rights as well as
socio-economic life,'' Wednesday's agreement said.
   The current 460-member Sejm will remain in place as the
``supreme authority of legislative power.'' However, 35 percent of
its seats will now be open to candidates independent of the Polish
United Workers (communist) Party.
   The party and its allies will occupy the other 65 percent,
making the communists a minority party that must work with
coalition partners to create a voting majority.
   Those allies, the Democratic Party and the United Peasant Party,
thus expect to gain more independence and power. The arrangement
could produce some lively results in now placid chamber.
   Anyone who collects 3,000 signatures can run for the Senate or
for the independent Sejm seats.
   Previously, only candidates approved by election commissions
formed by the communist party and its allies could be placed on the
ballot.
   The election law also guarantees the opposition access to
state-controlled media and the chance to publish a newspaper during
the campaign.
   The constitutiomal amendments also create a post of president,
which existed in Poland before World War II.
   While the legislative changes are meant to enhance democracy,
the six-year presidency is a party-inspired brake to ensure that
the party retains control for the immediate future.
   The president's term of office will last six years. He can
refuse to sign a bill into law. However, the Sejm can overrule a
presidential veto with a two-thirds vote.
   The Sejm and Senate jointly elect the president, who is expected
to be Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. He was leader when
Solidarity was banned.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright and his allies are
hoping for the best but preparing for the worst as a nine-month
ethics committee probe of his finances enters what appears to be
its final week.
   With his power and leadership post on the line, Wright is
already mounting a counteroffensive in anticipation of potentially
damaging findings when the ethics panel delivers its report.
   Among the preparations:
   _ Wright's lawyer, William Oldaker, is meeting with dozens of
House Democrats in an effort to answer some of the major
allegations swirling around the speaker. Wright lieutenants are
carrying thick, black notebooks prepared by Oldaker that respond
point by point.
   _ The Wright camp is believed to have planted a mid-week story
saying the ethics panel has essentially dismissed three of the six
original charges. And Wright business partner George Mallick has
been offering interviews in which he blasts the committee's special
investigator, Richard Phelan, as overzealous.
   _ Democrats are painting the case as purely a political
vendetta, ignited by jealousy over Wright's legislative success and
ability to influence Reagan administration policy on Central
America.
   _ In public statements, Wright has gradually come around to
saying he may have made mistakes. In a letter to his hometown Fort
Worth Star-Telegram, he said, however, that ``if I have ever even
technically violated any such rule, it would have been
unintentional.''
   The ethics panel, formally known as the Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct, starts its third week of deliberations
Tuesday. Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., says it is likely to get
down to reaching conclusions this week. But the findings will not
be announced until a report is prepared, he said, and that might
not be until next week.
   And in a move that seemed unlikely to bode much good for Wright,
the panel last week sought an additional $400,000 in investigative
expenses, including an extension of Phelan's contract through June.
   Two major questions are concerning the committee at this point,
according to sources who asked not to be identified.
   One is whether Wright, through bulk sales of his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' evaded limits on outside speaking
and writing fees. The other is whether perhaps $100,000 in benefits
paid by Fort Worth developer Mallick to Wright and his wife, Betty,
amount to improper gifts.
   Wright has assembled a volunteer defense team, including Reps.
Martin Frost and Jack Brooks, D-Texas, and Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,
who have been circulating among colleagues and inviting them to
meetings with Oldaker.
   ``There's been an effort to give Democratic members some
background on what's been happening,'' Frost said. ``To let them
know what the facts are, what the ethics committee is most
seriously examining... We want to present what the speaker's
positions are, rather than have them just read the newspaper.''
   Oldaker says that on one crucial issue _ whether Mallick had an
interest in legislation before Congress _ investigator Phelan is
trying to apply rules retroactively.
   Benefits Wright and his wife received from Mallick were offered
mostly before 1986, while any possible legislative interest by the
developer came after that date, says Oldaker.
   If Wright's standing on Capitol Hill is imperiled, it will be
because he has become politically too hot to handle for fellow
Democrats. One senior Democrat said lawmakers had found during
their Easter recess that ``it's beginning to be an issue out in the
country.''
   For all the gloom, though, Wright's House backers note with
satisfaction that Democrats scored victories in a pair of recent
congressional elections to fill vacancies in Indiana and Alabama.
   ``If people were upset ... would they elect someone from Jim
Wright's party?'' asked Hoyer. ``It's not a negative for us.''
   Wright, meanwhile, is portraying himself as tending to business
as usual. He delivered a foreign policy speech on Friday on one of
his favorite topics, Central America, to a Democratic policy group.
   And he met earlier in the week with Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias, only to face questions about his ethics case from reporters
when cameras were admitted to the room for a picture-taking session.
   ``What we're seeing is a heightened virulence of the political
debate, and what is perceived to be fair game,'' said Hoyer.
   He blamed much of the atmosphere on newly elected Minority Whip
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who demanded the ethics probe in the first
place. Many believe his elevation to the No.2 GOP leadership post
amounted to a reward for his handling of the Wright case.

   Islamabad warned Saturday that
Kabul's Marxist government risks ``serious consequences'' after a
Soviet-made Scud B missile landed inside Pakistan territory.
   The Afghan government called it an accident, saying the missile
missed its guerrilla target near Jalalabad and landed across the
border. But it refused to apologize and again accused Islamabad of
aiding the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   The missile hit about 500 yards inside the border early Friday.
It damaged a post office in the village of Torkham but injured no
one, government officials said.
   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the
incident was a ``brazen act of provocation by the Kabul regime
which was clearly designed to internationalize the situation in
Afghanistan in order to save itself from the wrath of its own
people.''
   Pakistan pledged to ``take all the necessary measures to defend
itself, and the lives and property of its citizens against such
attacks,'' the statement said.
   The missile _ with a range of up to 175 miles _ was believed
launched from the Afghan capital, about 120 miles west of the
Pakistan border. The guerrillas launched an offensive in March on
Jalalabad, 45 miles west of the border, and government troops have
been blasting the Jalalabad area with SS-1 Scud missiles.
   In Kabul, Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani
said the missile landed over the border by mistake.
   ``It was an accident,'' he said, adding: ``We do not need to
apologize when Pakistan is conducting its onslaught without any
apology.''
   Afghanistan has repeatedly accused Pakistan of sending military
personnel into Afghanistan to orchestrate Moslem rebel attacks on
government troops, who have been left to defend the country after a
Soviet troop pullout was completed in February. Pakistan denies
direct involvement.
   Amani said the missile strike caused casualties but he did not
elaborate.
   In the battle for Jalalabad, Amani said 78 guerrillas and nine
civilians were killed in the last 24 hours and asserted that no
government troops were killed. The report could not be verified.
   Amani also said that as of Saturday afternoon, Foreign Minister
Abdul Wakil was still waiting in Moscow for the United States to
grant him a visa to travel to U.N. headquarters in New York. He is
carrying an appeal from President Najib for an urgent U.N. Security
Council session to address the Afghan crisis.
   The Pakistani statement claimed the missile incident was a ploy
to convince the Security Council to debate the Afghan crisis even
though the charter of the 15-nation council prohibits debate on
domestic issues.
   ``The regime has resorted to its standard litany of baseless and
irrelevant allegations against Pakistan in an attempt to portray
the situation inside Afghanistan as a bilateral problem with
Pakistan that would threaten international peace,'' the statement
said.
   The Afghan charge d'affaires was summoned to the Foreign Office
and warned ``the responsibility for serious consequences that arise
from such an attack rests entirely on the Kabul government.''
   In March, a Scud missile landed about 300 yards from the border
on the Afghan side of Torkham. Islamabad said at the time it was
not concerned with what happened inside Afghan territory.
   Moscow gave Kabul the missiles in November despite protests from
Pakistan.
   Moslem insurgents headquartered in Pakistan and Iran have waged
more than a decade of war against Kabul's communist government.
Beginning in December 1979, Moscow sent more than 100,000 troops
into Afghanistan to replace one communist government with another.
   In April 1988, an agreement was signed in Geneva providing for
the withdrawal of the Red Army force. Moscow and Washington have
continued to supply weapons to their respective allies.

<HEAD>Census Questions Ready for 1990 Count</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just a year from now, more than 100 million
census forms will cascade into American homes in the 21st national
head count. Most folks will find the questions familiar, but there
are some changes from the past.
   The Constitution requires that the census be taken every year
ending in a zero, and that the count then be used to decide how
many seats in the House of Representatives belong to each state.
   Practically from the nation's beginning, however, the government
has asked for more information than just how many people there are.
   The additional questions provide data used to assess who
Americans are, their economic and social condition, and to help
design programs to deal with problems.
   While some people complain that the requests for information
invade their privacy, the Census Bureau refuses to ask things it
considers too intrusive. For example, requests that it ask people
about their religion, sexual preference, pets or handedness, were
turned down.
   The questions to be asked in 1990 were developed during a series
of public hearings in all 50 states over several years. The planned
questions were also submitted to Congress for review.
   While printing of the 1990 census forms has only just gotten
underway, preliminary copies were obtained by The Associated Press
and American Demographics magazine, which specializes in population
issues.
   Essentially there are two forms, short and long. The short form
contains seven population questions and seven housing questions,
which officials want answered by every household in the country.
Those questions are also the first part of the long form, which
will go to 17 percent of households and asks for considerably more
detail.
   American Demographics noted that a major change from 1980 will
distinguish between natural-born children and stepchildren in this
era of increasingly common divorce and remarriage.
   New questions about pension will allow statisticians to get a
better idea about the economic well-being of the elderly, and for
the first time the agency will ask about condominium fees, second
mortgages and mobile homes.
   Here is a question-by-question rundown on the 1990 census
shortform:
   1. Name of each person living in the household.
   2. How is this person related to the first person listed.
   Once upon a time, the first person was listed as the ``head'' of
the household, but that term is no longer used. The form simply
seeks to relate everyone to whomever the family lists first.
Choices include husband, wife, natural born or adopted child,
stepchild, father, mother, grandchild and other.
   3. Sex. Only two choices here.
   4. Race. The choices are White, black, American Indian, Eskimo,
Aleut, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese,
Asian Indian, Samoan, Guamian and other.
   5. Age and year of birth.
   6. Marital status. Choices include now married, widowed,
divorced, separated and never married.
   7. Is this person of Hispanic origin? Choices include no; yes
Mexican, yes Cuban, yes Puerto Rican and yes other.
   H1.a. Did you leave anyone out of your list of persons for
Question 1 because you were not sure if this person should be
listed _ for example, someone temporarily away on a business trip
or vacation, a newborn baby still in the hospital or a person who
stays here once in a while and has no other house?
   H1.b. Did you include anyone in your list of persons for
Question 1 even though you were not sure that the person should be
listed _ for example a visitor who is staying here temporarily or a
person who usually lives somewhere else?
   H2. Which best describes this building? Choices include mobile
home, one-family detached home, one-family attached home and
choices of several sized apartment buildings.
   H3. How many rooms do you have in this house or apartment? Do
not count bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers, halls.
   H4. Is this house or apartment: a. Owned by you or someone in
the household with a mortgage? b. Owned by you or someone in the
household free and clear? c. Rented for cash rent? d. Occupied
without payment of rent.
   H5.a. If this is a one-family house, is it on 10 or more acres?
   H5.b. Is there a business, such as a store or barber shop of
medical office on this property?
   H6. If you own, what is the value of this property? That is, how
much do you think this house and lot or condominium would sell for
if it were for sale?
   H7.a. If you rent, what is the amount of monthly rent?
   H7.b. Does this rent include any meals?

   The drug dealers along 3rd Avenue in Miami's
Overtown neighborhood all know Ann-Marie Adker.
   She's the nice old woman who will bid them a good day, then call
the police.
   ``I walk down the street and give them a wave and they say `Hi,
Mom,' and I keep walking,'' Adker said. ``It's when I get home,
behind closed doors, that I let the police know. You're just asking
for trouble if you go confront those dealers. Your life to them is
not worth a damn.''
   For more than 12 years, Adker has used her inner-city crime
prevention group to convince residents the best way to battle drug
traffickers is behind the scenes. Direct involvement can lead to
violence and retribution, she says.
   Her message is ringing with added clarity among community
leaders these days following last month's slaying of an outspoken
anti-drug activist in the crack-plagued community of West Perrine,
about 10 miles south of downtown.
   Metro-Dade police a week ago arrested two 21-year-old men on
charges they opened fire on Lee Arthur Lawrence outside his grocery
store. Authorities called the slaying a contract hit and were
searching for three suspects who allegedly ordered the killing.
   Police would not say how much they believe was paid to kill
Lawrence, 51, who had been the target of several shootings and
death threats since 1986.
   One of the suspects, Ronnie Johnson, is also accused of killing
a reputed Perrine drug dealer the week before the slaying of
Lawrence, whose funeral was attended by more than 800 mourners
including President Bush's son Jeb.
   ``At our meetings we never discuss who is doing drugs, because
you never know who might be listening,'' Adker said. ``To be
boisterous is to be foolish. This is no penny-ante game.
   ``The United States has won wars on foreign soil but they can't
subdue the drug dealers. We are in a war, and if you're not smart
you can get yourself killed.''
   ``Sure, it puts fear in your mind,'' said Georgia Ayres, founder
of the Citizens' Advisory Council, an anti-crime panel that works
with police. ``Self-preservation is the first law of nature. Most
people are going to back down if they or their family is threatened.
   ``The shooting of Mr. Lawrence shows how little regard they have
for human life. If you get in their way, they'll kill you.''
   Police, who have a tip-line to encourage citizens to report
suspected criminal activity, expressed regret at Lawrence's
shooting but said they couldn't offer round-the-clock protection on
the basis of vague death threats.
   Metro-Dade Police Director Fred Taylor, who had met with
Lawrence and other community leaders three days before the slaying,
said after the shooting: ``You don't know how bad I feel. They were
going to assist us by identifying some of the individuals. We just
can't live in this kind of society.''
   But he said ``we can't assign a policeman around the clock to
stay with somebody unless we have specifics. I don't know what we
could have done.''
   For some residents, a call to Irby McKnight at Miami's Urban
League chapter is as far as they will go in reporting suspected
drug activity.
   He says he senses the growing apprehension among the formerly
bold tipsters.
   ``The fear of retaliation is strong in the community,'' said
McKnight, a crime-prevention specialist. ``They think the drug
dealers are in control and the best thing to do is keep quiet.''
   But others hope the much-publicized Lawrence slaying will awaken
more residents to challenge the strong-arm reign of drug
traffickers in some poor neighborhoods.
   Last weekend, more than 100 West Perrine residents and clergy
members took part in an anti-drug march that was being organized by
Lawrence before the slaying.
   ``We cannot afford to be afraid,'' said Johnnie McMillian,
president of the Miami-Dade chapter of the National Organization
for the Advancement of Colored People. ``We are all in danger and
we can't save ourselves by being afraid.''
   At Lawrence's March 25 funeral, many calls were made to use the
death as a rallying point against drug-related violence.
   ``You could interpret the shooting as a message that the drug
dealers are in control or that things have gotten to a point where
we have to make a stand,'' said John Bennett, executive director of
the Tacolcy community center in Miami's Liberty City section. ``I
don't think people want to live in fear and silence.''

<HEAD>Nation's School Buildings Growing Old and Overcrowded, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 22,000 school buildings in the
nation are inadequate and 13 percent of those are structurally
unsound, according to a study released Saturday by the Education
Writers Association.
   The study found that one in four of the nation's 88,021 public
school buildings need maintenance or major repairs, are overcrowded
or obsolete, present environmental hazards or have multiple
problems.
   Another third stack up as ``only adequate and because of growing
enrollments and deferred maintenance could easily become
inadequate,'' said the study, called ``Wolves at the Schoolhouse
Door.''
   The study cites antiquated facilities, an enrollment boom and
inadequate capital funds in concluding that ``the schoolhouse may
be the most seriously threatened part of the infrastructure.''
   The EWA based its findings on federal statistics, national
surveys, surveys of school building personnel at 38 state education
departments, state reports on school buildings and analyses of
buildings in seven representative states.
   One-fifth of the nation's schools were constructed more than 50
years ago, the association said. Nearly two-thirds were built in
the 1950s and 1960s, ``generally a time of rapid and cheap
construction... Many construction experts say the buildings were
intended to last only about 30 years. If so, their time is up.''
   The group said replacement costs for all school buildings are
estimated at $422 billion. States estimate schools need $84 billion
in new or retrofitting construction and $41 million in maintenance
and repairs.
   Many states and school districts are investing below the
recommended level of 2 to 4 percent of replacement value in annual
maintenance, the study found. Specifically it cited Maine,
Minnesota, North Carolina and Tennessee with investments of 1.4
percent, 2.2 percent, 2.2 percent and 1.3 percent respectively.
   EWA noted that a school building boom is under way. It cited
Census Bureau statistics that school construction was up almost 50
percent from 1982 to 1986. It said school districts estimate they
will spend nearly $22 billion on new construction, additions and
modernization between 1988 and 1990. In addition, school bonds led
all categories of municipal bonds in 1987 with a value of $9
billion.
   But EWA pointed out that only a small percentage of students
will ever attend new schools. ``Most will spend their school days
in old, sometimes remodeled, buildings; many will shuffle to and
fro among portable buildings.''
   And it noted that new investment varies substantially by region.
The South led in dollar volume in 1986-87 at $1.33 billion, the
study said. Next was the Southwest at $1.06 billion, followed by
New York-New Jersey at $857 million. The West, consisting of
California, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii, was fourth. School
investment dropped in Alaska and the Northwest while stabilizing in
the Mountain and Great Lakes states.
   Based on responses from 14 states, ``only 39 percent of the
projected funding needs for construction and renovation will be met
between 1989 and 1992,'' EWA said. Sixteen states gave districts no
capital financing assistance, the study said, including two with
the most severe enrollment crunches _ Nevada and Texas.
   EWA said erratic data collection, inconsistent state involvement
and the unevenness of the problem are depriving districts of an
opportunity to make long-term plans and avoid past mistakes.
   ``These problems cannot be overlooked much longer,'' the group
warned. ``The uneven distribution of resources and planning
capacities allows tremendous inequities in the local environment
that prespares children for the future, often within a few miles of
each other.''
   EWA is an association of education writers for publications
across the country. Its report was released at the group's annual
seminar.

<HEAD>Weekend Talks Held as Eastern Deadline Approaches</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Tops with 5 grafs to update with talks resuming today.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines is flying the bare-bones
schedule it has kept since a strike began last month while its
three unions and prospective new owners meet through the weekend in
hopes of making a deal to revive the carrier.
   The negotiations, which entered their second day today, center
on concessions sought by former baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth and his partners. But before agreeing to any wage and
benefit cuts the unions are seeking assurances the new owners have
a plan to bring bankrupt Eastern back to profitability.
   The two sides met most of the day Friday in sessions described
by one source as ``highly preliminary'' and focused primarily on
the language of the Ueberroth group's tentative agreement to buy
Eastern from Texas Air Corp.
   Talks resumed at about 10 a.m. today. David Shapiro, appointed
by a bankruptcy judge as examiner to oversee Eastern operations, is
mediating the discussions.
   Union officials said it was highly unlikely a deal would be
struck during the weekend. A deadline does loom, however.
Ueberroth's $464 million purchase agreement allows him to call off
the deal if he does not reach new contract agreements with the
unions by midnight Tuesday.
   ``This will take some time because it's not only money
involved,'' said an International Association of Machinists
official who asked not to be identified. ``How does our ownership
part shape up? How do we get our passengers back? What kind of job
security is involved?''
   IAM spokesman Jim Conley said the unions would have no statement
on the negotiations because both sides in the talks had agreed to a
news blackout requested by the bankruptcy judge overseeing Eastern.
   That judge would have to approve any sale of Eastern, which has
been all but grounded since the Machinists struck March 4. The
airline's pilots and flight attendants have honored IAM pickets.
   In other development, Texas Air filed a lawsuit Friday alleging
that takeover specialist Carl Icahn was trying to interfere with
the sale. The lawsuit in Fort Bend County district court near
Houston charges that Icahn has ``illegally communicated and
negotiated'' with the Eastern unions.
   Ueberroth, who made millions in the travel business before
entering the sports world as head of the 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles, was not on hand for the Friday talks but was expected to
participate if significant progress is made.
   Representatives of the Air Line Pilots Association and the
Transport Workers Union, which represents Eastern flight
attendants, also are involved in the talks.
   The IAM struck Eastern after rejecting concessions demanded by
Texas Air.
   Ueberroth, according to sources, wants $210 million in wage and
benefit concessions.
   Wally Haber, general chairman of the Machinists District 100 in
Miami, which represents Eastern mechanics and ground workers, said
$210 million is the total amount of concessions requested earlier
by Texas Air, $150 million of that from Machinists. He said he did
not know if Ueberroth had adopted the Texas Air demands as his own.
   Haber said Machinists were willing to accept 15 percent wage and
benefit concessions.
   Union officials have indicated a willingness to accept
concessions provided Eastern was sold to a new owner. Also,
Ueberroth's agreements give employees a 30 percent ownership stake
in return for concessions.
   Eastern has been flying about 110 flights a day during the
strike. Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said the sale agreement
caused no noticeable increase in passenger loads Friday.

   A bus carrying socccer fans crashed
early Saturday in the southern Algarve region, killing 13 people
and injuring at least 28, police said.
   A spokesman for the National Republican Guard said the bus
swerved off the road near the town of Bartolomeu de Messines and
landed upside down, trapping some passengers inside.
   The town is about 180 miles south of Lisbon.
   A tire blow-out was the likely cause of the accident, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa reported two cranes had to right
the bus before the dead and injured could be removed and
transported to hospitals.
   The bus was carrying supporters of an Algarve soccer team to a
match in northern Oporto, the agency reported.
   The bus was licensed to carry 46 people, but it was not sure how
many passengers were on board, Lusa said.

<HEAD>Plenty of Reactors Available to Make Material for Nuclear Bombs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even if the Mikhail S. Gorbachev keeps his
pledge to shut down three military reactors, the Soviet Union will
have at least 11 others able to make material for nuclear bombs,
according to experts and documents available in the West.
   Gorbachev, in his latest arms control gesture, announced in
London on Friday that the Soviet Union had shut down one
plutonium-enrichment reactor in 1987 and would close two more over
the next two years. He said his country would stop producing
weapons-grade uranium.
   The size and even the location of Soviet military reactors is a
closely guarded secret, and Gorbachev did not spell out which
reactors would be closed, and which or even how many would remain
open.
   ``The difficulty we have is that he has wrapped his program in
such a veil of secrecy that we cannot get a reading of how much
further he needs to go,'' said Tom Cochran, a nuclear physicist at
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   ``On the uranium side, the United States had produced a huge
surplus of weapons uranium in 1964, and shut off all production of
that. What he is doing is do what we did 25 years ago,'' said
Cochran.
   The Soviets already have an estimated 115 metric tons of
plutonium and 500 metric tons of enriched uranium, mostly in the
32,000 nuclear weapons thought to be in their arsenal, said Cochran
and Stan Norris, co-authors of a book on the Soviet weapons complex.
   The United States has about 110 metric tons of plutonium, with
further production frozen because the only three U.S. reactors able
to produce nuclear weapons materials, at the Savannah River Site in
Aiken, S.C., have been shut down because they cannot be operated
safely.
   Cochran, who has extensive contacts with Soviet scientists and
arms control officials and travels regularly to the Soviet Union,
said he had advised the Russians to seek a freeze like the one
proposed by Gorbachev.
   ``We pointed out to them the timeliness of this, as the United
States prepares to make major commitment'' to spend an estimated $8
billion to build a new generation of weapons reactors at Savannah
River and Idaho Falls, Idaho.
   ``Gorbachev clearly has taken a step that sends a signal that
they are ready to enter negotiations on ending production of
fissionable materials'' used in nuclear weapons, said Cochran.
   U.S. officials were slow to respond to Gorbachev's proposal.
President Bush, at his news conference Friday, said he had not
analyzed Gorbachev's proposal, ``so I honestly can't tell you that
I know the full significance.''
   One government expert on the Soviet nuclear industry said it
appeared that the plants mentioned in Gorbachev's announcement were
being closed for safety reasons.
   ``My estimate is that he is making some political mileage out of
steps they have taken for safety reasons,'' said the official,
speaking on condition that he not be further identified.
   Intelligence analysts declined to divulge their data on the
Soviet nuclear weapons complex, but two officials with access to
the classified reports said the information provided by Cochran and
Norris in telephone interviews went significantly beyond what has
been disclosed in public.
   The Soviets maintain two major weapons complexes, one at Kyshtym
in the Ural Mountains near Chelyabinsk and the other at Tomsk, deep
in Siberia, said Cochran.
   Those two complexes apparently are the sites of 14 Soviet
weapons reactors mentioned by Assistant Secretary of Energy Troy
Wade in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee earlier
this year. It was not clear whether that number included the one
shut own in 1987.
   Six of the reactors, known as the Troitsk series, are located at
Kyshtym and are run by the Soviet Ministry of Medium Machine
Building, one of 12 Soviet defense industry ministries, according
to government officials.
   The actual number of Soviet reactors able to produce weapons
material may be much higher, Wade said, because they use
water-cooled graphite reactors, like the RBMK reactors at
Chernobyl, to make nuclear weapons materials as well as electricity
for civilian use.
   Two of the Troistsk reactors were built in the late 1950's, a
few years after the three U.S. nuclear weapons production reactors
at Savannah River, and could be ready for retirement, according to
one government analyst.

<HEAD>Charges Filed Against Hijacker of New York-Bound Bus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Saturday charged a Montreal man who
hijacked a New York-bound Greyhound bus and held its driver and 10
passengers hostage for eight hours outside Parliament.
   Charles Jean Yacoub appeared briefly in court and was charged
with hostage-taking, unlawful confinement, using a firearm in a
criminal act and illegal possession of a firearm. The
hostage-taking charge could bring a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
   Yacoub, 32, was ordered held in custody pending another hearing
Monday.
   Police said Yacoub hijacked the bus in Montreal, diverted it to
Ottawa and held police at bay for eight hours, saying he had
dynamite. The bus had veered and stopped on the lawn outside the
center of Canadian government.
   The hijacking ended peacefully and without injuries Friday
evening, and Canadian police said the hostages were flown to New
York at Greyhound expense.
   CTV television quoted security forces as saying the gunman was
demanding Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon and free all
prisoners. Syria sent troops into Lebanon as a peacekeeping force
after the civil war between Lebanese Moslems and Christians erupted
in 1975.
   Henry Jensen, deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian
MMounties, said Yacoub emigrated to Canada from Lebanon in 1976.
   Police said he identified himself as acting on behalf of the
Front for the Liberation of Christian Lebanon, a group that
authorities were not sure existed.
   The incident posed questions about government security. Quebec
provincial police alerted U.S. border authorities but not security
forces in neighboring Ontario.
   The hijacker released the first hostage, an elderly man, at the
Champlain Bridge just outside of Montreal before heading on to
Ottawa, 100 miles to the west.
   Police said the hijacker told the hostage:``You're going to get
off here _ everything is going to blow up.''
   Three female hostages and one man were released in the first few
hours of the Ottawa standoff, and the male driver left the vehicle
just before the hijacking came to an end. Police briefly checked
the final five hostages before concluding they were not involved
with the hijacker.
   No explosives were found.
   The red-white-and-blue bus, which left deep ruts in the usually
immaculate lawns of Parliament Hill, was towed to a police garage
Saturday.

   Former President Ford says he cried in
the Oval Office when doctors told him that his wife had breast
cancer. He called it ``the lowest and loneliest moment'' in his
895-day presidency.
   ``Nowadays, more often than not, I'm introduced as Betty Ford's
husband,'' Ford joked Friday.
   He spoke at a forum entitled ``Gerald Ford: Restoring the
Presidency,'' the seventh presidential conference held at Hofstra
University on Long Island in a series that began in 1982 with a
focus on Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   Ford learned on Sept. 28, 1974, less than two months after
President Nixon resigned and he took office, that Mrs. Ford had
breast cancer, he said.
   Ford said he was proud of his wife's evolution into a leading
spokeswoman on breast cancer and alcohol addiction.
   Ford, a tanned and trim 75, said he and Jimmy Carter, who
defeated Ford in 1976, have become close friends.
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who served as Ford's chief of
staff, said the Ford presidency represented the ``fundamental
success of the constitutional system. ... In the face of nearly
certain impeachment of a president, the political process
functioned superbly.''
   Cheney also praised Ford for restoring the nation's confidence
in the presidency.
   ``Gerald Ford regained for the institution of the presidency the
respect and power it required to direct this republic in a time of
tremendous challenge,'' Cheney said.

   Televangelist Jim Bakker, who moved to
Florida in search of a broadcast center for his ministry, has
obtained a new ordination after losing his credentials twice in the
last year, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The former PTL leader is now affiliated with the New Covenant
Christian Church of Cranesville, Pa., a town of 700 people.
   Herbert Moore, treasurer of Bakker's New Covenant Church in
Charlotte, N.C., told The Orlando Sentinel that Bakker's
certificate with the Pennsylvania church became effective last
month.
   Bakker and his wife Tammy Faye have been staying at the Lake
George Ministries Retreat, a local community for ministers
suffering emotional distress, while looking for a permanent place
to produce their television program.
   Bakker is free on $50,000 bail and received permission last
month from a federal magistrate to move to Florida while awaiting
trial on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with PTL.
   Bakker resigned from the PTL ministry in March 1987 after
revelations of a 1980 tryst with a church secretary, Jessica Hahn,
and subsequent payments to her. The Assemblies of God later
stripped him of his ministerial credentials.
   Faith Christian Fellowship International of Tulsa, Okla.,
ordained him in November 1987, but he lost that credential one year
later after failing to meet the group's requirement to furnish
information about his ministry.
   Bakker in the meantime had started the New Covenant Church.

   Dr. John Brooks Slaughter has been
inaugurated as the first black president in the 102-year history of
Occidental College, and trustees said they hope he'll prepare the
school for a more diverse future.
   More than 200 representatives of colleges and scholarly
organizations attended Friday's inauguration at the park-like
campus, said Occidental spokeswoman Frances Hill.
   Slaughter, the school's 11th president, physically took over the
job last August when Dr. Richard C. Gilman resigned the post, which
he had held for 23 years.
   Slaughter, 55, had been chancellor of the University of
Maryland, and previously was director of the National Science
Foundation.
   Since its founding in 1887, Occidental College had been a small,
prestigious liberal arts college with a mostly white student
population. The fact that Slaughter is black, and his extensive
background in engineering, appealed to the board of trustees, Ms.
Hill said.
   ``There was a recognition by the trustees, who are largely white
males ... that change is coming, that the next century is going to
require a different approach,'' she said.
   ``The population of California shows you that white males are
becoming a minority. There was a feeling among the trustees that we
needed to find somebody who bridges many fields, many cultures.''
   Slaughter, born in Topeka, Kan., received his Bachelor of
Science degree from Kansas State University in 1956. He received
his doctorate degree from the University of California in San Diego
in 1971.

   A handful of fans held up cardboard
masks of Margo Adams when Boston's Wade Boggs came to bat against
Kansas City.
   The masks were distributed by a local radio station at a main
entrance prior to Friday night's first game of the Red Sox' weekend
series with the Royals. Adams has a much-publicized lawsuit pending
against the Boston third baseman asking for damages and lost wages
during the period she spent with Boggs in a relationship.
   The masks apparently failed to distract Boggs, who singled in

   Another Daley will soon reign from the fifth
floor of City Hall and in the old neighborhood, in places like
Vita's Clips and Snips, Grassano's Jewelry and Sheehan's Tap, all
seems right with the world again.
   ``You go to work, you raise a family, you keep up your property,
you live with your own,'' said Ed Burba, ticking off the priorities
for residents of Bridgeport, the working-class, Southwest Side
enclave that Mayor-elect Richard M. Daley, his late father, Mayor
Richard J. Daley, and three other Chicago mayors have called home.
   ``And,'' he added, ``you have a Daley calling the shots
downtown.''
   Nearly a week after the mayoral election, the familiar red,
white and blue Daley campaign posters remain tied to trees and
taped to windows. But nothing is like it once was _ even in fabled
Bridgeport.
   There are more blacks, more Asians, many more Hispanics and
fewer city jobs to go around than there once were.
   The stockyards nearby are shuttered, a few storefronts along the
commercial artery are boarded up, pockets of poverty swell at its
edges, and even the most unabashed Daley backers among its 32,000
residents know the son can't recreate the halcyon days of the
father.
   It has been 12 years since that fateful day when Richard J., age
74 and less than a year into his sixth term, suffered a heart
attack and died.
   Shock waves rippled across all of Chicago, but nowhere with more
effect than in Bridgeport. The Old Man, as Daley is still called
with affection, rarely missed a christening, a wedding or a wake
and almost everyone in Bridgeport _ or so it seems _ knew him, his
wife, or one of their seven children.
   And more than a few owed their livelihood to the acquaintance.
   ``We've got firemen, people from (the departments of) streets
and sanitation, water, whatever. ... A lot of people still work for
the city,'' Burba said. ``But it's nothing like it once was.''
   When Edward J. Kelly became the first of five native sons to
call the shots downtown in 1933, Bridgeport was a Democratic
precinct captain's dream, an all-white, blue-collar neighborhood
covering three square miles, full of immigrants from Ireland,
Italy, Poland and Latvia living in single-family brick bungalows or
small apartment buildings.
   So well-oiled was Bridgeport's political machinery that when
Kelly left the mayor's office in 1947, it went to another native
son, Martin Kennelly, who was, in turn, pushed out of the way eight
years later by Richard J. Daley.
   After Daley's death in late 1976, yet another Bridgeporter,
Michael Bilandic, filled the rest of Daley's term and to the
victorious continued to flow most of the spoils.
   But soon thereafter, the courts narrowed the stream with a
series of decisions severely limiting political hirings and
firings. And in 1979, an upstart Democrat named Jane Byrne, a
one-time protege of the elder Daley who spent much of her
subsequent term fearing a challenge from the younger Daley, upset
Bilandic in the mayor's race and shut the spigot completely.
   Residents differ, sometimes heatedly, on whether garbage pickup,
snow removal and other city services got better or worse under the
late Harold Washington, who defeated Mrs. Byrne in 1983 to become
Chicago's first black mayor. It was Washington's death in late
1987, just months into his second term, that set in motion the rise
to power of the younger Daley.
   Pearl Koltz usually solves such debates simply by reminding both
sides, ``we got kind of spoiled.''
   Almost no one in Bridgeport expects it to happen again, even
with ``Richie'' Daley in charge.
   ``Times change,'' said Sherri Yersich, trying to corral her
three youngsters in front of the two-flat across the street from
Burba's home.
   ``People who come into the neighborhood now think it's
political. But I hear stories from my uncle ... who used to be a
precinct captain, about how everybody, even kids, used to pass out
literature and ring doorbells and that kind of stuff. It just
doesn't go on much anymore.
   ``I mean, my husband works for the city, and he's a good friend
of Richie's. But other than go to his victory party the other
night, we didn't really do much.
   ``But you know what? I grew up in Bridgeport and lived here all
my life,'' she added, ``and just knowing Richie is the mayor makes
things seem a little more like they've always been.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev looked more at home in the
splendor of London's ancient Guildhall than in shirt-sleeves in
Cuba during the Soviet president's six-day trip abroad.
   Gorbachev's gains, if any, from private talks with Cuban
president Fidel Castro in Havana may not be apparent for some time,
but he reaped positive news during his later stop in London.
   Gorbachev got a ringing endorsement from Britain's staunchly
anti-communist prime minister and a promise of a visit from Queen
Elizabeth II. The queen would be the first British monarch to visit
Russia since the Communists killed Czar Nicholas II and his family,
who were cousins of the queen's forebears.
   But U.S. officials said they were disappointed that Gorbachev's
visit to Cuba produced no signal the Soviets were prepared to
disengage from Central America, where the superpowers are pitted
against each other by proxy.
   Gorbachev and Castro stressed solidarity, though Cuba has shown
no inclination toward liberalization policies being adopted in
Moscow, Beijing and much of Eastern Europe.
   But Gorbachev, who has shown more interest in wooing Western
banks and business than in propping up Third World revolutionaries,
made no move to ease Cuba's huge debt burden. Analysts had
speculated some measure of debt forgiveness might be forthcoming as
a good-will gesture during the Soviet President's first visit to
Cuba.
   Instead, Gorbachev said the Cuban government should be more
careful in spending Soviet aid.
   ``As in the past, the Soviet Union and Cuba have a common
approach to the key problems of international affairs,'' Gorbachev
told the Cuban National Assembly. ``We are resolutely against any
theories and doctrines justifying the export of revolution or
counterrevolution and all forms of interference in the affairs of
sovereign nations.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he welcomed the
statement but said it was not supported by action. The Bush
administration, which just committed to end military aid to the
Contra rebels in Soviet-backed Nicaragua, had hoped for a clearer
signal that the Soviet government would reduce arms shipments to
the Sandinista regime, he said.
   But seasoned observers in Havana said even if that was
Gorbachev's intention, he would not have said so in Cuba,
Nicaragua's strongest ally.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
people have come to expect too much from the Soviet leader.
   ``It's the rabbit-from-the-hat approach,'' Gerasimov said.
``With other politicians, you don't expect so much, but when
Gorbachev speaks, you expect him to pull out a rabbit every time.''
   But after leaving the island, a Gorbachev aide hinted that the
Soviet Communist Party chief may try to mediate the long-running
feud between Cuba and the United States.
   Although Castro's public remarks were peppered with
anti-American slogans, Georgi Shakhnazarov, a foreign policy
adviser to Gorbachev, said the Cuban leader indicated privately he
wants to normalize relations with the United States.
   Asked if Gorbachev could bring the two neighbors back together,
Shakhnazarov said: ``The general secretary tries not to miss any
opportunity'' to encourage better relations.
   In London, the Soviet leader addressed magnificantly robed
British luminaries in Guildhall. He then received from Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher the endorsement he has sought from the
West since launching his modernization campaign four years ago.
   Speaking at Guildhall, Gorbachev summarized his goals for an
international television audience.
   ``We are building an open, democratic and free society which has
learned the lessons of its past, a society based on law and
responsibility, a society that keeps its citizens well informed,''
Gorbachev said. ``We are building a society that rests on its
citizens' initiative and enterprise, on Soviet socialist patriotism
and dedication to human socialism aimed at elevating the human
being.''
   Mrs. Thatcher called him ``one of those rare people who has the
vision, the boldness and the sheer power of personality to change
the whole future of his country and to have a profound effect on
the wider world as well.''
   ``We want you to succeed in your task,'' she told Gorbachev.
``First because we believe that in your vision lies a better life
for the Soviet people, but also because every step toward greater
democracy, human rights and freedom of choice in your country
brings us closer together.''
   And she pledged: ``We're ready to help in practical ways, too,
where our help is sought and desired.''

   Sheriff Art Martinak is so proud of his new
jail he has invited 40 guests to spend the night for free.
   The stay in the Linn County facility includes private room,
breakfast and dinner, and a fresh change of clothes.
   ``The only thing we don't provide is candy on your pillow,''
Martinak said.
   As many as 40 people were invited to sleep at the jail on one of
two nights, April 21-22.
   No reservations, Martinak said. It's first-come, first-served.
   ``This will allow the public to get a feel for what it's like to
be incarcerated and to see the ins and outs of the building they're
paying for,'' said Lt. Dave Burright.
   ``It gives our people a chance to train with real live people
who don't pose a security problem, before they have to deal with
the real thing.''
   A jail open house is scheduled for April 23.

   In a 1984 geography test, 20 percent of
Kentucky's college students couldn't find the Ohio River on a map.
Many of them thought the Appalachian mountains were in Europe.
   But fourth- through eighth-graders at a contest Friday knew that
Ecuador was the world's leading producer of bananas and that the
Great Victoria Desert is in Australia.
   Ninety-seven pupils competed in the geography contest for the
chance to represent Kentucky at the National Geography Bee in
Washington on May 19.
   The winner, 13-year-old Joe Wong of Conkwright Junior High
School in Winchester, admitted his final question was relatively
easy.
   ``The Napa Valley of California and the Bordeaux region of
France have what agricultural product in common?'' the California
native was asked.
   ``They both grow grapes for wine,'' he answered.
   Many of the earlier questions were tough, though.
   ``What islands were formerly called the Sandwich Islands?'' one
boy was asked. He didn't know.
   ``In which direction do ocean currents circulate in the middle
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere?'' The next pupil didn't know.
   `What two islands are known for their use of geothermal
energy?'' That one was missed, too.
   (The answers: Hawaii, clockwise, and New Zealand and Iceland.)
   The National Geographic Society organized the geography bees
partly because of the appalling scores of U.S. students of all ages
on geography tests.

<HEAD>Sinking of Submarine Latest Accident to Hit Nuclear Fleet</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet Sub, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sinking of a nuclear-powered submarine off the
coast of Norway is at least the third serious incident in the
Soviet nuclear fleet in 2{ years and comes amid growing Soviet
public concern over nuclear safety.
   The accident came five months after a reported near-meltdown in
a nuclear reactor aboard a Soviet icebreaker in the port city of
Murmansk.
   That accident touched off a public outcry that prevented another
nuclear-powered ship from docking in the Far East.
   In October 1986, three sailors died in a fire and explosion
aboard a Yankee-class nuclear-powered submarine in the Atlantic
Ocean that was armed with ballistic missiles.
   Since the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant in the Ukraine that killed at least 31 people
and sent a cloud of radiation into the atmosphere, Soviet people
have become wary of nuclear power, both on land and at sea.
   In November, the nuclear powered icebreaker Rossiya pulled into
Murmansk, near the border with Finland, for the routine changing of
a filter in one of its two pressurized reactors.
   A report in the newspaper Vodny Transport four months after the
incident said the routine job almost turned into a disastrous
nuclear meltdown.
   According to the report, the chief physicist aboard the ship
gave incorrect instructions to a reactor operator who in turn
drained vital cooling water from operating reactor rather than the
one shut down for the repairs.
   Had the water drained 30 minutes longer, a meltdown releasing
radiation into the air over the city of 440,000 people would have
occurred, the newspaper said. The ``situation was liquidated'' in
four minutes, the newspaper's Murmansk correspondent said.
   Three days later, the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya said two
cities and a region in the Soviet Far East refused entry to a
nuclear-powered merchant ship, Sevmorput, which had reported
fractures in its hull.
   ``A deficit of information, piled on top of the invisible shadow
of the Chernobyl tragedy and the most complex ecological situation
in the region, detonated a powerful explosion of public
indignation,'' the newspaper said.
   Officials claimed that the hull fractures presented no danger to
the nuclear plant on the ship, but the public was not assured. At
last report, the ship was still anchored off Vladivostok, its fate
undecided.
   Refusal of officials in the ports of Vladivostok and Nakhodka
and the region of Magadan highlighted a groundswell of public
opposition to nuclear power that began with the Chernobyl disaster.
   The policy of glasnost, or openness, initiated by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has resulted in a growing vocal opposition to
nuclear power.
   Officials scrapped plans to build six nuclear power stations
because of safety concerns. Another plant in Armenia was closed
after the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed 25,000 people prompted
fears of a nuclear disaster.
   Although the sinking of a nuclear submarine off the coast of
Norway did not affect public safety in the Soviet Union, it
reinforced concerns about the safety of nuclear power.
   With those concerns in mind, officials have apparently changed
the course of the country's ambitious nuclear program.
   Previously, nuclear stations were concentrated in populous
regions in the eastern part of the country. Hydroelectric plants
now will be built to supply local power and nuclear stations will
be constructed in remote regions where they will pose little danger
to the public.

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Activists Set for March On Capital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of thousands of pro-choice activists,
including a huge array of Hollywood superstars, have thronged into
the capital for a march Sunday billed as the largest demonstration
ever in favor of abortion rights.
   ``Tomorrow is only a beginning,'' declared Molly Yard, president
of the National Organization for Women. ``It is a statement to
President Bush and to the Supreme Court that the women of this
country are not going back.''
   At a news conference at which she and other march organizers
were cheered by dozens of show business personalities, Ms. Yard
added: ``At last the majority of this country is going to stand up
for our rights to control our reproductive lives.''
   She predicted a turnout that would ``easily'' more than double
the size of a similar march in Washington three years ago. Police
estimated that crowd at 90,000.
   Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights League,
declined to predict a number but said: ``I'll tell you this. I
think we're going to close Washington down.''
   The march launches an intensified campaign by the pro-choice
community to cement public opinion in favor of a women's right to
abortion as the Supreme Court nears a major challenge to its
landmark 1973 decision, Roe vs. Wade, that legalized the procedure.
The new case is scheduled for argument April 26.
   Actress Morgan Fairchild, among 250 show business personalities
participating in the march and related events, said: ``We are here
to support the majority in this country who believe that Americans
can be trusted to make their own decisions about reproductive
health care, without interference from government at any level. We
believe that we, the people, rather than the politicians, should
control our most intimate decisions.
   ``We recognize that we may have been to complacent,'' said Ms.
Fairchild. ``In 1973 ... we thought this issue had been put to
rest. We thought that our years of risking infection sterility, and
death itself were finally over. We thought that American women
would no longer die each year from botched, illegal abortions. We
thought we and our daughters were safe.''
   But with the pending Missouri case before a more conservative
court, ``We are relearning what Thomas Jefferson taught this
country more than 200 years ago: Eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty,'' she said.
   Among those joining the Hollywood delegation were Karen Akers,
Ellen Burstyn, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Bonnie Franklin, Lee Grant,
Veronica Hamel, Mariel Hemingway, Margot Kidder, Michelle Lee,
Melissa Manchester, Kelly McGillis, an 8-month-pregnant Susan
Sarandon and Cybill Shepherd.
   The new campaign includes the nationwide distribution of a
videotape, ``Abortion: For Survival'' aimed at countering the
anti-abortion movement's trademark video, ``Silent Scream.''
   The pro-choice production includes footage of a woman undergoing
an abortion to show the procedure is ``safe and simple,'' and
includes at look at the almost indiscernible remains taken from the
uterus in a first-trimester abortion.
   The videotape ``puts it where it's at,'' said Eleanor Smeal,
president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. ``It talks about
abortion as a public health necessity and essential for the
well-being of millions of American women.
   ``It features the central issue of this debate: What is
abortion, why it's needed and why the public health and medical
establishment of our society and worldwide is for keeping it
legal.''
   The tape is being distributed to government officials and
members of Congress and state legislatures as well as on college
campuses nationwide, she said.
   March organizers said other parts of their campaign include
applying pressure on government agencies and pharmaceutical
companies to improve available contraception, and standing up to
Operation Rescue's attempts to close down abortion clinics.
   President Bush told anti-abortion activists a few days after he
moved into the Oval Office that he wanted the Supreme Court's 1973
decision overturned.
   March organizers said participants included tens of thousands of
students from about 500 colleges, many of them in the Northeast, as
well as delegations from churches, labor unions and other groups.
The weather forecast called for sunny skies, moderate breezes, and
temperatures in the 60s by the noon start.
   A counterdemonstration ``death march'' by anti-abortion
advocates was expected to draw about 300 people, according to
Olivia Gans, director of American Victims of Abortion. ``Our
organization is here to support equal rights for unborn women _
specifically the right to life,'' she said.
   The march route of the pro-choice demonstrators will take them
past a field of 4,400 white crosses erected by anti-abortion
activists near the Capitol, symbolizing the number of abortions
performed on an average day.

   The families of two women slain by
what police suspect is a serial killer went on a talk show in hopes
someone with information about the murders will come forward.
   Judy DeSantos, sister of Nancy Paiva, one of eight women found
slain around area highways, made her first trip by plane to tape
the ``Geraldo'' program with host Geraldo Rivera in New York.
   ``I would never fly before,'' Mrs. DeSantos said. ``It's my way
of saying, `Nancy, I'm trying.'''
   The families of Ms. Paiva and Robin Rhodes, another victim, flew
to New York to join Bristol County District Attorney Ronald A.
Pina, via satellite. The hourlong show taped Thursday night will
air April 20.
   Members of both families were apprehensive about appearing on a
national television show, but wanted to persuade those with
information about the case to come forward, said Jean Arsenault,
Ms. Rhodes' mother.
   ``This way, maybe it will reach a lot of people out there,'' she
said.
   ``Maybe we can reach some poor girl, just one person, who was
going on the same path as my sister. Maybe, when she sees what
we're going through, she'll think twice,'' said Donna Rogers,
sister of Ms. Rhodes.
   The eight slain women were all cocaine or heroin users, and some
were addicts, authorities say.
   Investigators believe the women, found along or near Route 140
in Freetown, Interstate 195 in Dartmouth and Route 88 in Westport
were killed by the same person or group of people working together.
   Pina said he believes the women probably knew their killer or
killers.

   Johnny Bench, the retired Cincinnati Reds
catcher who will be inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in July,
stopped just short of calling for the resignation of Pete Rose as
manager of the Reds.
   ``Too many things are adding up,'' Bench, Rose's teammate on the
Reds for many years and currently a Reds broadcaster, said in an
interview Friday night with television station WCPO.
   ``Too many things are pointing toward Pete Rose and as a result,
baseball is starting to suffer. The evidence is so large right now
and aiming toward Pete in so many ways. All of the sudden we're
trying to find ways for Pete to step down gracefully. And that is
really sad.''
   Bench and Rose were teammates on the World Champion Reds of 1975
and 1976.
   Rose is being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service for
tax evasion and gambling, The Cincinnati Post reported Saturday.
   The baseball commissioner's office has been looking into the
gambling, and he could be suspended from the game, for life if it
is shown he bet on the Reds while he was the team's manager.

   Thousands of gallons of crude oil glop
scooped up from Prince William Sound are being loaded onto barges
and could eventually be sold and even used to pave highways, Exxon
said.
   As operations enter their third week, workers have recovered
more than 16,000 barrels of the 240,000 barrels spilled from the
Exxon Valdez. The oil sits in barges along with thousands of
gallons of seawater that have been seived, sucked, sopped and
strained. A barrel is 42 gallons.
   ``For every gallon of oil we recover, we get one or two gallons
of water,'' said Henry Beathard, an Exxon spokesman.
   Beathard said despite the waterlogged condition of the oil, it
has some commercial potential.
   ``Any oil that's in the water, you can separate it and get the
water out,'' he said.
   While Beathard said it wasn't clear what the oil might wind up
as _ maybe heating oil, maybe asphalt _ the re-refining task will
be done down in ``the lower 48.''
   ``We haven't decided which refinery it will go to, but we'll
probably move it down in barges,'' he said.

   The mushrooming political spending habits of
special interest groups moderated during the last election cycle,
but still reached a record $349.6 million, a federal agency said
Saturday.
   Spending by 4,828 political action committees rose 5 percent
during 1987 and 1988 over what it had been for the previous
two-year cycle, according to figures compiled by the Federal
Election Commission.
   By comparison, that 1985 and 1986 spending had represented a 22
percent jump over the prior reporting period, 1983 and 1984.
   Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, benefit most
from the generosity of the special interests, according to the
commission's figures. The groups tend to favor incumbents, and
incumbents tend to win re-election.
   The tilt toward incumbents and away from challengers increased
this year, and that bothers Common Cause, a lobbying group that has
opposed the political system's growing dependence on money from
political action committees.
   These committees, also known as PACs, are a legal device that
under the sponsorship of corporations, labor unions and other
organizations are allowed to raise large sums of money and channel
it into political campaigns.
   Under federal law, a PAC can give five times as much money to a
particular candidate as can an individual.
   While a PAC can give a candidate up to $5,000 for each primary,
runoff and general election, an individual can give only $1,000 in
each instance.
   In 1987 and 1988, some $1.2 billion overall was spent on
campaigns for Congress and president, including money from the
federal government, individuals, political parties and PACs. Of
that total, the PACs accounted for about 28 percent, according to
figures compiled by the election commission.
   During 1987-88, the PACs put 74 percent of their money on
incumbents, while in the previous two-year period 68 percent of the
money went to people already in office, according to the
commission's study. Challengers reaped 12 percent of the PAC money
in the last election, while 14 percent got it for their races in
1986.
   Common Cause spokesman Randy Huwa said the PAC money spent on
congressional winners also rose last year.
   ``That went up from $101 million in 1986 to $122 million in
1988,'' he said. ``So members who were elected in 1988 are more
indebted to PACs than any class in history, so I don't see that
necessarily as indicating that PAC growth is slowing.''
   In addition to giving money directly to candidates, the PACs can
spend an unlimited amount on behalf of a candidate, for example, by
producing and airing television commercials. The law requires that
these efforts must not be controlled by or coordinated with the
candidate's campaign organization.
   These ``independent expenditures'' amounted to $20.2 million in
1988, up from $9.4 million in 1986, according to the commission.
   Almost all of that increase came from one PAC, the National
Security Political Action Committee, a conservative organization
that zoomed to the top of the charts in spending last year, with
outlays of some $10.3 million.
   According to the election commission's records, nearly $8.1
million of that was spent for the benefit of George Bush.
   However, the tone of the group's advertisements and its methods
of fund raising caused Bush's campaign to disavow it publicly and
to file a formal complaint against it.

   South Africa said Saturday it has
rejected a U.N. cease-fire plan designed to halt the hostilities in
northern Namibia that threaten the territory's independence.
   In a letter released Saturday, South African Foreign Minister
Pik Botha dismissed an offer by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar for amending a regional peace accord signed in December
by South Africa, Angola and Cuba.
   Officials from those three countries, as well as U.S. and Soviet
observers, held emergency talks into Saturday night at Mount Etjo,
a safari lodge about 120 miles north of Windhoek, Namibia's
capital. There was no immediate comment from those officials.
   The meeting was held in a bid to stop the fighting and preserve
a U.N.-supervised independence plan agreed to in December. That
plan took effect April 1.
   De Cuellar's proposal suggested that SWAPO guerrillas, who
reportedly have entered Namibia in violation of the peace accord,
be given two choices, Botha said.
   The guerrillas should be allowed to keep their arms and be
escorted to SWAPO bases in neighboring Angola, or they could lay
down their arms and stay in Namibia as civilians, he said.
   Botha rejected the amendment, saying the guerrillas must
surrender their weapons and be taken to bases in Angola.
   South Africa says SWAPO has sent more than 1,900 guerrillas into
northern Namibia since April 1 in violation of the peace accord,
which requires the insurgents to remain at bases at least 100 miles
inside Angola.
   SWAPO maintains that the insurgents were inside Namibia before
April 1 and will not return to Angola.
   Since then, at least 262 guerrillas of the South-West Africa
People's Organization and 28 members of the South African-led
security forces have been killed in the heaviest fighting of the
territory's 23-year war, police said.
   SWAPO officials outside Namibia have disputed the figures and
say many civilians also have been killed. There were no reports of
battles on Saturday, and officials said they believed guerrillas
were running low on supplies.
   On Friday, the U.N. Security Council said it was satisfied that
South Africa still sought to grant independence to the territory it
has ruled since World War I.
   Some U.N. officials suggested SWAPO field commanders mistakenly
thought their units could return to Namibia and set up bases there.
Several captured guerrillas have said they returned to Namibia in
search of U.N. personnel and expected no confrontations with
security forces.
   The U.N. has authorized 4,650 peace-keeping troops for Namibia,
but less than 1,000 have arrived. Of that total, the only forces in
the northern battle areas are about 300 logistical personnel.
   SWAPO has been favored to win pre-independence elections
scheduled for November under the U.N. plan.
   The December accord by South Africa, Cuba and Angola called for
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops who have helped Marxist Angola
battle U.S.-backed rebels. South Africa agreed to stop supporting
the rebels and pledged independence for Namibia.

<HEAD>Honduran Streets Quiet After Friday Protests</HEAD>

   Helicopters buzzed overhead and
hundreds of police and soldiers patrolled the streets Saturday
after dispersing 1,500 anti-American protesters commemorating last
year's burning of the U.S. Consulate.
   ``Troops will impede, with force if necessary, any protests
against our democratic institutions and the lives of Hondurans,''
armed forces spokesman, Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, said at a
news conference.
   ``Our forces will stay in the streets until we are sure that no
disorder will occur,'' he said.
   Police on Friday night used truncheons and water hoses to
disperse protesters, who burned U.S. flags and shouted
anti-American slogans in Tegucigalpa.
   The consulate was burned last year in a week of violent
anti-American protests that began after reputed drug kingpin Juan
Ramon Matta was extradited to the United States. Four Hondurans
died and 1,000 were jailed in those protests ,and the government
declared a 10-day state of emergency.
   Under the Honduran constitution, no citizen can be extradited or
forced to leave the country against his will. But Matta was
captured on April 5, 1988, by Honduran authorities and two days
later was extradited to the United States. He is serving a
three-year sentence at the federal prison in Marion, Ill., for
escaping from a Florida prison in 1971.
   Matta allegedly is linked to Colombia's Medellin drug cartel,
which reportedly controls 80 percent of cocaine traffic to the
United States.
   The demonstrations Friday also were to protest U.S. military
presence in Honduras.
   Since 1982, the United States and Honduras have intensified
military maneuvers provided for under a 1954 treaty. In the past
nine years, more than 100,000 U.S. soldiers have come to Honduras
to train the 20,000-member Honduran armed forces.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With national elections
looming, three white anti-apartheid parties merged Saturday in
hopes of boosting their collectively sagging fortunes.
   The formation of the new Democratic Party is an attempt to
broaden the political base of white liberals, who have suffered
repeated setbacks in recent years.
   ``The party commits itself to the establishment of a genuine
South African democracy which rejects race as its basis, (and)
protects the human dignity and liberty of all its citizens,'' said
Willem de Klerk, a leading member of the new party.
   The first major test for the Democratic Party will come in this
year's parliamentary elections, expected between late July and
early September. President P.W. Botha announced the election
Thursday, but he has yet to set an exact date.
   The Democratic Party will have three leaders who served as the
heads of the merging parties. They are Zac de Beer of the
Progressive Federal Party, Wynand Malan of the National Democratic
Movement and Denis Worrall of the Independent Party.
   At a rally in Johannesburg, party leaders said they oppose all
forms of apartheid, support a free enterprise economic system, and
want increased emphasis on individual rights.
   The organization seeks to attract voters disillusioned with
Botha's National Party and its inability to break the black-white
political stalemate.
   The Democratic Party indicated it wants to work closely with
blacks, who have no vote in national affairs. However, the
organization made clear that it rejects the violence employed
African National Congress, the main black guerrilla group
attempting to undermine the government.
   ``Democracy can never be built on the foundation of ... bombs,''
said de Beer. ``The ANC must end the campaign of symbolic terror.''
   The new party has drawn little attention from black
organizations, many of whom see white liberals as politically
ineffective.
   ``The liberal left in this country has not done much to make the
government change apartheid,'' said City Press, a leading
black-oriented newspaper. ``Until such time that we're all allowed
to vote, the new Democratic Party is just another white affair.''
   The Progressive Federal Party had 17 of the 178 seats in the
white chamber of Parliament, while the National Democratic Movement
had three and the Independent Party none.
   Botha's National Party, which has ruled South Africa for 41
years, maintains firm control of the white chamber with 133 seats.
The extreme-right Conservative Party is the official opposition
with 24 seats.
   Botha announced his intention to step down after the election.
   South Africa's tri-cameral Parliament has separate houses for
whites, Asians and people of mixed-race but not for the nation's
28-million black majority.
   White liberal parties draw their support almost exclusively from
the major urban areas such as Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban,
and they have been losing some support in recent years.
   The Conservative Party overtook the Progressive Federal Party in
1987 elections to become the leading opposition.
   The Progressive Federal Party was formed in 1959, and one of its
founding members, Helen Suzman, has been a member of Parliament
since 1953. Ms. Suzman, one of the country's best-known
anti-apartheid campaigners, said she would not hold any official
position in the Democratic Party.

   The managing editor of a major Turkish
newsmagazine went into hiding after being sentenced to nine years
in jail for articles carried by the leftist publication, friends
say.
   Fatma Yazici, managing editor of the Toward 2000 weekly was
charged with producing communist and Kurdish propaganda, insulting
Islam and being disrespectful to the president.
   The 33-year-old editor went underground last month after three
convictions were upheld and she was sentenced to nine years in
prison, friends said.
   During the 26 months Ms. Yazici shouldered the news and legal
responsibilities for the magazine, seven copies of the magazine
were confiscated on seven occasions. She faced prosecution 32 times.
   Toward 2000 has been on newsstands since January 1987 and has
risen to the No. 2 spot among newsweeklies, with a circulation of
30,000.
   The magazine has constantly been in trouble with authorities for
tackling taboo subjects which often lead to prosecution under the
country's restrictive press law.

   About 200 police backed by helicopters and
dogs searched Saturday for six inmates who fled an overcrowded jail
by sawing through the bars on a window and shimmying over a
razor-sharp fence.
   Thirteen inmates clad in prison green escaped Friday night, but
two were captured a few hours after the escape and five others were
nabbed on Saturday.
   Helicopters hovered over snow-dusted hills and search dogs
sniffed along abandoned wharves while police combed streets and
alleys.
   The inmates, including seven awaiting trial and six convicted of
charges ranging from theft to armed robbery, escaped in a group
from the Norfolk County House of Correction, where chronic
overcrowding and racial tensions have fueled several outbreaks of
violence in recent months.
   Sheriff Clifford Marshall said authorities viewed the break as
inevitable because of the jail's crumbling structures and its
dangerous mixture of inmates.
   The population of the 173-year-old granite fortress is at any
given time likely to include mass murderers and accused burglars,
teen-agers and hardened older inmates, drugs users and those with
communicable diseases.
   The stifling conditions likely drove the men, some of whom had
as few as 30 days left to serve, to commit the felony break that
could put them back in jail for up to 10 years, Marshall said.
   ``It certainly can drive people to drastic things,'' he said.
   The facility houses 240 prisoners. The federally ordered cap is
172, but corrections officials have had to house inmates in the
boiler room and the recreation hall.
   Someone outside the jail probably tossed hacksaws over the
15-foot brick wall, Marshall said. Cutting through the old prison
bars would not have been difficult, he said.
   The bars are so brittle that the jail's deputies routinely
strike them with rubber hammers, checking for a sound that
indicates they have been sawed through.
   In February the jail was forced to undergo a five-day lockdown
after an outbreak of violence, Marshall said.

   Homicide detectives rank high
among the types of workers most in need of a sense of humor to help
lighten a difficult profession. So someone concocted a slogan,
slapped it on a button and Voila!: ``Our day begins when yours
ends.''
   That's the serious point behind humor _ how it can relieve
stress _ for Joel Goodman, founder and director of the Humor
Project.
   The group is sponsoring its fourth annual national conference
this weekend on ``The Positive Power of Humor and Creativity.'' It
drew hundreds of participants from as far away as Australia,
Hawaii, Sweden and Singapore.
   ``One myth is that humor equals joke-telling,'' Goodman told an
auditorium packed to capacity with educators and business people,
health care workers, chaplains, consultants and administrators.
``Humor is not always appropriate, but it's more appropriate than
people realize.''
   But this is not some bunch of jokers brought together to have a
laugh _ even though consummate funnyman Jay Leno took a break from
his ``Tonight Show'' guest duties and touring to perform for the
group during the opening session Friday.
   The conference aims to help folks deal with stress in the home
and workplace, find ways to be creative and also ``to take their
jobs seriously but themselves lightly,'' Goodman said.
   For the bankers, managers, engineers and tycoons, there also are
workshops to help them use humor as a management tool, ``as a way
of improving the corporate culture,'' Goodman said.
   ``There's a lot of pressure in business to be more creative, to
find better ways to increase productivity,'' said Jane Conner, who
owns Centerpoint Associates, a management training and consulting
firm in Austin, Texas.
   She said she often runs across managers who are ``challenged
beyond the skills and techniques that they have to handle those
challenges.''
   ``If they can laugh a little bit, it's just another way to look
at a problem and deal with stress,'' she said.
   Goodman has several theories about the power of humor, and he
says everyone has an innate sense of humor ``that's often covered
over by years of misuse.''
   ``But even if we missed the boat when that quality was handed
out, we can still develop it,'' Goodman told his audience of 1,000
on Friday.
   He offered examples of humor from everyday life, adding that
``nothing is quite as funny as the unintended humor of reality.''
   Take, for instance, the notice that appeared on a church
bulletin board alerting parishioners to the sermons for the day and
evening services.
   ``9:30 a.m. Jesus Walks on Water. 5:30 p.m. Searching for
Jesus.''
   Or how about the sign on a hospital bulletin board?
   ``Research Shows That The First 5 Minutes of Life Can Be Most
Risky.'' Penciled underneath: ``The Last 5 Minutes Ain't So Hot
Either.''
   Guffaws abounded as Goodman strutted across the stage, much like
a professional comedian.
   ``Humor is a way of maintaining control,'' he said, as another
crop of one-liners began to build.
   ``It's a great way of building relationships.''
   ``It's a great way of ending them.''

<HEAD>Khomeini Orders Aid to Troops at Front Cut in 6 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini on Saturday ordered that aid to troops at the cease-fire
line with Iraq be discontinued within six months, Tehran radio
reported.
   Khomeini's order is the first indication Iran plans to cut its
forces along the 670-mile border with Iraq since the countries
halted their eight-year Persian Gulf War with a cease-fire in
August.
   ``Deplete supplies within six months and end the work,'' the
radio quoted Khomeini as saying in a letter to Hojatoleslam
Mohammad Ali Rahmani, head of the committee responsible for sending
aid to the forces at the front.
   The 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch appeared to be referring
to border supplies the government solicited from private citizens.
The radio statement, monitored in Nicosia, was unclear whether
Khomeini wanted the supply program stopped for all armed forces or
just the voluntary units known as the Basij.
   U.N. observers monitor the cease-fire, but separate
U.N.-sponsored talks for a permanent peace have made no significant
progress.
   Khomeini's directive follows meetings Thursday between Iranian
foreign ministry officials and U.N. officials to lay the groundwork
for a new round of peace talks between Iran's foreign minister, Ali
Akbar Velayati, and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz.
   Velayati and Aziz have agreed to hold a new round of talks in
the near future at an undisclosed site near U.N. headquarters, but
no date or exact venue has been set.
   The talks deadlocked over Iran's insistence that Iraqi troops
withdraw from Iranian territory, while Iraq insists that the first
step should be the clearing of the Shatt al-Arab waterway.

<HEAD>Communist Guerrillas Capture Eight Mountain Climbers, Suspect Some
As Spies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist guerrillas said Saturday
they captured eight mountain climbers, including three foreigners,
on the country's tallest peak to check if any were military
informants.
   The Menardo Arce Command, a guerrilla unit of the Communist New
People's Army operating in southern Mindanao, said they also
detained the climbers also to protect them from rebel mines.
   But they said the three foreigners and the five Filipinos,
captured Tuesday, will be released soon because interrogation
showed they were not spies.
   More than 300 climbers were on 9,690-foot Mount Apo for a
mountaineering convention.
   ``The presence of foreigners in the area gave us reason to
suspect they were sent by the enemies in order to spy or study the
terrain ... all in the guise of mountain climbing,'' the command
said in a statement.
   The statement said the foreigners included Gerald Leo
Christopher Kennedy of Ireland, New Zealander Trevor James Anderson
and James Andrew Smart of Britain.
   The group apologized for the detention but said it was necessary
for the ``best interest'' of the mountain climbers.
   ``To protect it (the area) from enemy troops, we had earlier
installed various defense mechanisms, including booby traps and
land mines in several strategic points of the mountain trail,'' it
said.
   The rebel command said Mount Apo is part of rebel territory and
any person entering the area should first ask for their permission.
   Tuesday's incident was reported to the military only Friday,
said Maj. Antonio Inciong, regional chief of the military's civil
relations service.
   Among the detained Filipinos was the Rev. Vic Dimaranan, a Roman
Catholic priest, Inciong added.
   The climbers who trekked to the mountain were attending the
annual convention of the Philippine National Mountaineering
Federation, Inciong said.
   The state-run Philippine News Agency said the climbers were met
by some 100 guerrillas near Tudaya Falls on the outskirts of the
village of Baracatan.

   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev sent word to
President Bush to inform him of the sinking of a Soviet nuclear
submarine, the White House said Saturday.
   Gorbachev sent a message through the State Department, telling
the president there was no possibility of explosion or
radioactivity from the submarine accident off the northern coast of
Norway, said White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk.
   He said Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin called the State
Department Friday night with the message for Bush from Gorbachev.
   ``The purpose was to inform the president of the soviet
submarine incident,'' Popadiuk said.
   ``Ambassador Dubinin relayed that the submarine had sunk, that
there were a number of casualties but that the possibility of an
explosion and radioactivity is excluded and that search and rescue
continues,'' Popadiuk said.
   White House National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft relayed
the message to Bush, who was at the presidential retreat in Camp
David, Md.
   Popadiuk said he knew of no Soviets request for U.S. assistance
and that the United States was not involved in cleanup.

   Negotiators at world trade talks on Saturday
settled a dispute over textile exports and other issues that had
held up a 2{-year effort to liberalize global commerce, a spokesman
said.
   Delegates adopted the accord in a closed session, said David
Woods, a spokesman for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said that
``a stalemate that has dogged the negotiations has been broken.''
   Negotiators were deadlocked in efforts to achieve a major
revision in the GATT under the Uruguay Round of talks, which began
in 1986 and are to run through 1990. The accord reached Saturday
will serve as a framework for further negotiations.
   GATT regulates world trade treaties and settles commerce
disputes.
   The accord, signed by 100 countries, includes settlements of
disputes over farm supports, textiles, intellectual property such
as patents and safeguards against sudden surges in imports,
officials said.
   Settlements in the other 11 areas of negotiations were reached
in December at a meeting in Montreal.
   On Friday, the European Economic Community announced it had
reached an agreement with the United States on the issue of farm
supports. The settlement became possible after Washington dropped
its insistence on the elimination of all farm subsidies.
   The agreement calls for an overall freeze on farm supports and
import barriers through 1990. It calls for countries to reduce
their subsidies in 1990 but does not specify by how much.
   Ms. Hills said she hoped the accord would result in a gradual
correction in the U.S.trade imbalance ``in the context of export
expansion rather than import contraction.''
   Under another agreement reached Saturday, delegates resolved EEC
objections to earlier draft language that the 12-nation group said
would remove textile and clothing barriers too rapidly. The
agreement calls for further negotiations will be held later this
month.
   Developing countries with large textile industries want liberal
regulations. Industrialized countries such as the United States and
EEC members are concerned about the impact a lack of restrictions
might have on domestic industries.

   An oil drilling platform with a 300-ton
crane flipped over in heavy seas as it was being towed, but
officials said Saturday the rig contained very little oil and there
was no threat of a leak.
   No one was injured when The Five Sisters platform overturned
Friday 65 miles southeast of Charleston on the edge of the
Continental Shelf, said Seth Tane, owner of Carolina Sea Service,
the company in charge of the salvage.
   The platform was unmanned at the time of the accident, Tane said.
   ``I feel fairly certain the rig is salvageable,'' Tane said. He
said he would work with Fred Devine Diving and Salvage, a Portland,
Ore., company that worked in salvaging the tanker Exxon Valdez in
Alaska.
   High seas were preventing the salvage from beginning Saturday,
he said.
   The platform contained 500 gallons of lubricants, said Tane,
quoting the platform's owners, Maitland Brothers Inc. of
Littlestown, Pa. He earlier had reported the vessel was carrying
10,000 gallons of fuel oil, and that there was danger of a spill.
   There has been no sign of oil in the water, Tane said.
   The platform resembles a huge cake pan with four legs that
extend 95 feet into the air and 80 feet into the sea below. The
legs can be extended to reach the floor of the sea for drilling
operations.
   The platform was being towed by two tugboats from Puerto Rico to
Boston, where it was to be used in an underwater pipeline project,
Tane said.
   On Friday, the tug captain released the 2|-inch cables that
bound the tugs to the platform because he was worried about the
stability of his vessel amid 12- to 14-foot seas, Tane said. The
platform then overturned, Tane said.
   Stormy weather forced the submerged platform further out to sea
late Friday.

   Even though the Reagan administration vowed it
wasn't helping the Contras in defiance of Congress' wishes, the
government now admits that President Reagan, George Shultz, William
Casey and dozens of others were leaning on other countries to give
the Nicaraguan rebels arms and money.
   Using code names like ``Tipped Kettle II,'' ``Elephant Herd,''
and ``Focal Point,'' U.S. officials praised, cajoled, warned and
admonished other governments in the massive secret effort to keep
the Contra movement alive.
   Details of the effort were laid out in an extraordinary document
read into the record Thursday in the trial of Oliver North, the
fired National Security Council aide accused of breaking the law in
efforts to help the Nicaraguan rebels. The government and North's
attorneys agreed that the facts in the document are true.
   The outlines of this arm-twisting effort had emerged in previous
news reports and in the congressional investigation into the
Iran-Contra case. But the extent of the government's efforts and
the number of individuals who were aware of them are described for
the first time in the summary of facts.
   The document names at least 40 U.S. officials, incluing
President Bush _ then Reagan's vice president _ who were aware of
the clandestine efforts to get assistance for the Contras,
including during the 1984-85 period when Congress blocked direct
and indirect U.S. aid to the rebels, and into 1986 when only
non-lethal aid was allowed.
   North's defense hinges on the argument he orchestrated the
efforts at the orders of White House superiors. That proposition is
bolstered by the court document, in which 107 points of fact are
asserted.
   Those facts show the aid efforts took bizarre turns.
   Longtime enemies Taiwan and the People's Republic of China were
both approached to aid the Contras. Apparently the meeting with the
representative of the Communist government was under FBI
surveillance, because the document says the FBI was asked to keep
its report on the meeting secret.
   In another apparent case of the government watching itself, the
document said the White House and the CIA ``learned of reports'' of
a meeting between an Israeli government official and Michael
Armacost, then undersecretary of state for political affairs, to
discuss Israeli help for the Contras.
   And North met with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, who
offered to kill Sandinista leaders if the United States would help
him clean up his image. North rejected the assassination proposal,
but said Noriega might help in sabotage in Nicaragua. The Reagan
administration later indicted Noriega in connection with drug
dealing.
   The court document's 107 points center on Reagan administration
efforts to enlist other countries in the Contra effort. In
particular, major pressure was applied to get Nicaragua's four
closest neighbors _ El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, and
Guatemala _ to provide arms, facilitate weapons deliveries and
allow their territory to be used for support operations.
   Quid pro quo arrangements abounded.
   Reagan, depicted as taking an active role in third-country
solicitation, was told in February 1985 that Honduras needed ``some
enticements...so that it would maintain its aid to the
resistance,'' said a memo from then-National Security adviser
Robert McFarlane.
   Subsequently ``the president personally authorized the entire
plan'' in which the Hondurans were to receive expedited economic
aid and military assistance in exchange for helping the Contras,
the court summary says.
   Bush is cited as an emissary from the White House to Honduras,
carrying word in March 1985 to then-President Roberto Suazo that
Reagan would speed U.S. aid to his country.
   While Reagan was telephoning and sending messages to Suazo
urging that he do all in his power to ``support those who struggle
for freedom and democracy,'' State Department officials publicly
were sounding a different tone. They assured congressional hearings
that the government view was that solicitation of third countries
was illegal under the ongoing aid ban.
   Later in 1985, the Hondurans again were waffling, annoyed that
they were being put upon.
   They were upset that promised U.S. aid had not come through and
were ``particularly angry that the U.S. Embassy there had recently
denied any connection with the resistance, referring inquiries to
representatives of Honduras,'' the court summary said.
   By early 1986, the importance of getting Honduran cooperation
for the secret Contra air resupply network led to plans for Bush to
play a major role in pressuring the new president, Jose Azcona.
   The document does not say whether Bush ultimately carried it
out, but cites a State Department memo prepared for a Bush meeting
with Azcona, with the Honduran expected to insist on getting
``clear economic and social benefits from its cooperation with the
United States.''
   Bush was to emphasize the importance of keeping the Contras
strong, while National Security Adviser John Poindexter would meet
privately with Azcona to seek a commitment for Honduran support of
the Contras, the document said.
   The late CIA Director William Casey also is depicted as playing
a key role in bringing other countries into the Contra-aid business.
   In mid July of 1984, he told his deputy John McMahon and Deputy
Secretary of State Kenneth Dam that ``those present ought to get
moving'' on non-U.S. funding for the rebels in light of Attorney
Gen. William French Smith's ruling that such fund-raising would not
be an impeachable offense _ a fear that had been raised by then
White House Chief of Staff James A. Baker III. Baker is now Bush's
secretary of state.
   Smith's ruling stated that third-country solicitation was
acceptable only if there was no ``quid pro quo.''
   As early as August of 1984, shortly after Congress cut off U.S.
aid to the rebels, Secretary Shultz was proposing a plan to ``wink
at lethal support for the resistance,'' according to the document.
The idea was that the United States would give arms to El Salvador
which in turn would give arms to the contras.
   In his testimony to the congressional Iran-Contra investigating
committees, however, Shultz had said he opposed soliciting third
countries that were major U.S. aid recipients.
   If Contra supporters were rewarded, then the Reagan White House
took the opposite view of those who didn't cooperate.
   In the case of Costa Rica, its new president Oscar Arias was a
persona non grata in Washington after his government revealed in
September 1986 the existence of the Santa Elena airstrip, which his
predecessor had sanctioned for use by the Contra supply operation.
North recommended cancellation of a planned Arias visit to the
White House because of the Santa Elena disclosure.
   Conversely, North got Reagan to agree in March 1986 to pose for
a ``photo opportunity'' with Costa Rican official Benjamin Piza,
who had arranged for construction of the Santa Elena airstrip.
   In 1986, the Guatemalans were seeking new U.S. recognition for
their assistance to the Contras.
   After meeting with Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo in
September 1986, the court document says, a U.S. official informed
Reagan, Bush, Shultz, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and
Poindexter ``that in return for Guatemalan support for the
resistance, Cerezo would ask Secretary of State Shultz to triple
military assistance ot Guatemala, to double economic assistance to
Guatemala, and to undertake other forms of support for Guatemala.''
   North had recommended in March 1985 that additional military aid
be sent to Guatemala ``as a means of compensating Guatemala for the
assistance it was providing to the resistance,'' the court document
said.
   Guatemala had a valuable role as provider of phony end user
certificates that certified it was the recipient of $8 million
worth of weapons shipments that actually were going to the rebels.

   If you want to find Richwood in the next
few days, just follow your nose. It's the place that smells of
ramps, the wild, odoriferous leeks whose spring harvest was
celebrated Saturday.
   ``The total thing, it stinks,'' said Duke Cowell, a patrolman
for the Richwood Police Department and a ramp eater for all of his
42 years. ``You wanted to know the truth, didn't you?''
   The festival is billed as ``The Feast of The Ramson'' and pays
tribute to the strongly favored leeks that grow in the nearby
mountains. About 1,000 pounds of ramps were harvested this year and
boiled down Saturday for the annual feed.
   Two days of snow didn't deter thousands of out-of-staters
flocking to the little town.
   ``There were piles of people. There were probably more people
from out of state than there are in Richwood,'' Cowell said.
``Since the coal companies shut down, there's only about 3,300
people in Richwood.''
   The ramps, served with ham, sausage, beans, cornbread and
buttermilk in a meal at Richwood High School, emit a strong odor
that's been called both pleasant and malodorous.
   All agree the scent is long-lasting.
   ``The smell will last in town for four or five days, and that's
no joke,'' Cowell said. He advised a home remedy _ frequent
gargling with vinegar _ to clear the breath in only two days or so.
   He said he would begin gargling Saturday night.

   Sales of Challenger license plates
have already paid for a memorial to the shuttle's seven astronauts
and are helping to fund future trips to Mars, state officials say.
   The design on the license plate features the space shuttle
rising on an orange-and-white cloud into a blue sky. It was
conceived in the months following the 1986 shuttle explosion in
which the seven lost their lives.
   The plates, costing an extra $15, went on sale in January 1987.
More than 500,000 people have bought or renewed the plates,
bringing in $5 million in 1987 and about $4.5 million last year.
   The state Legislature designated a quarter of the money for
scholarships and another quarter for the Florida Technical Research
and Development Authority to research manned missions to Mars.
   The rest is going to build and maintain the memorial at the
Kennedy Space Center.
   ``To bring in $5 million in one year from these tags, without
any advertising or promotion, boggles my mind,'' says Ben Everidge,
head of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation in Titusville. ``We had
no idea the tags would take off like that.''
   The $5 million memorial, to be inaugurated in October, is 50 by
40 feet and will rotate to follow the sun. The names of the seven
Challenger astronauts, along with the three killed in the Apollo
fire and four who died in training accidents, were etched by laser
onto its reflecting surface.
   The monument will stand on raised ground in front of the
visitors center near the entrance to the space center.

   A survey to find out what the public
considers obscene may be too obscene for city sponsorship, some
City Council members say.
   ``I read just the first two questions and realized that some of
the very things we are trying to take off the shelves are now going
out as part of our questions,'' council member Bob Long said Friday.
   The draft version of a questionnaire reviewed by city officials
Thursday asks people their opinions of 15 sexual acts ranging from
heterosexual intercourse to bestiality.
   The purpose of the survey is to define contemporary community
standards as an aid in prosecuting pornographers.
   But council members are nervous.
   ``This is not what I understood the intent to be,'' said council
member Janice Rettman. ``When a woman from the polling firm stood
up in committee some time ago and read off a bunch of questions,
they were pretty innocuous _ not about three people on a couch.
This sounds almost like we're sending out pornography ourselves.''
   Council President Jim Scheibel wants each council member to
study the draft questionnaire prepared by Minnesota Opinion
Research Inc. of Minneapolis. He then wants the council to vote on
it one more time, probably next week, before the poll goes to the
public.

   Authorities on Saturday said at least
three nurses killed dozens of patients with overdoses of insulin
and other medication.
   Franz Priessnitz, a senior police official involved in the
investigation, told Austrian Television the nurses killed the
patients for ``a kind of euthanasia.'' He said among those killed
were patients they considered disagreeable.
   ``But the fact that they were most seriously ill always played a
role,'' the official said, adding ``we have so far 30 to 32 cases
of killing'' patients.
   Initial reports said the killings took place over the past year,
but police gave no specific time frame.
   The three women were arrested for questioning Friday, and
Guenter Boegl, the Vienna police chief, said Saturday that they had
confessed. Boegl said more people could be apprehended.
   No formal charges were filed by late Saturday.
   Euthanasia, a method of causing painless death, is advocated by
some as a way to deal with people suffering from incurable painful
diseases.
   Josef Siska, head of the homicide squad, told Austrian radio
earlier Saturday the killing of the patients at Vienna's Lainz
Hospital ``not only consisted of the administration of medication''
but did not elaborate.
   Priessnitz said a 30-year-old nurse was suspected of killing up
to 20 patients. The other two nurses were 25 and 27 years old, the
Austria Press Agency reported, quoting unconfirmed reports.
   Priessnitz said the three nurses did not act jointly but
separately, although it was not clear what each knew of the others'
criminal acts.
   Boegl said all three nurses made confessions, ``which differ
essentially only as to the number of possible victims.''
   Alois Stacher, Vienna's municipal health councilman, notified
police after doctors found that a patient had recently received an
overdose of insulin that could have been mortal. The patient
survived, Stacher told Austrian television Friday.

   The Solidarity trade union said Saturday
it will field opposition candidates for every available seat in the
two-chamber parliament in the country's first free elections since
World War II.
   Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said the list of
candidates for the June elections should be ready by late April or
early May.
   The candidates will run under the Solidarity Citizens Committee,
a group of more than 100 top union leaders and opposition
intellectuals that has served as a policy council to Lech Walesa
since December. They will have the full support of the independent
trade union, a committee statement said.
   Solidarity has said it aspires to act solely as a trade union.
Committee members say their group was formed as a separate
political structure that shares the trade union's ideals.
   ``Solidarity will not organize the election campaign, it is not
going to take part in elections, but is asking the Citizens'
Committee to cultivate those open fields,'' Onyszkiewicz said.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa led the committee meeting in a
Warsaw church one day after the Sejm, or parliament, passed bills
putting into law the economic and political agreements approved
Wednesday by Walesa and Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak.
The accords ended two months of talks between authorities and the
opposition.
   The laws legalize Solidarity _ banned since martial law was
declared in 1981 _ set free elections and create the post of
presidency.
   The new parliament will consist of a newly created 100-member
Senate and the 460-member sejm. Elections to the Senate will be
freely contested. The Communist Party and its allies will be
assured 65 percent of the seats in the Sejm, with 35 percent
reserved for independent, non-party candidates.
   The Communist Party, with majority control of parliamnet, also
would hold the presidency.
   The Solidarity Citizens' Committee formed subcommittees to deal
with campaign organization, access to radio and television,
coordination of candidates, and election newspaper and finances.
   Walesa delivered a short speech to open the meeting, which
lasted more than six hours.
   ``Thanking you for our common great political and public
victory, let me ask you to make use of this victory so we can
together choose some way of putting freedom into practice,'' he
said.
   In the past, Solidarity called for boycotts of elections to
express disapproval of government policies.
   The boycott appeals and public dissatisfication led to low voter
turnouts and finally to public rejection of a government referendum
on economic reform in November 1987.
   The opposition agreed to participate in elections in exchange
for the restoration of Solidarity's legal status.
   Authorities first proposed talks with the opposition on
political and economic reform during the a wave of nationwide
strikes in August.

   Police placed a mosque under government
control Saturday, one day after Moslem extremists clashed with
police after attending a prayer service at the mosque.
   Four people were wounded and 39 detained in the clashes Friday
in Fayoum, about 60 miles southeast of Cairo, said Maj. Gen.
Mohammed Ahmed Mahran, Fayoum's security chief.
   He said detainees included Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, a blind
preacher who was acquitted of charges connected to the 1981
assassination of President Anwar Sadat.
   Mahran blamed Abdel-Rahman for the violence, saying that for the
past eight months the sheik had ``incited his followers against the
government'' in sermons he delivered at Al-Shuhada Mosque.
   He said Abdel-Rahman, spiritual leader of a fundamentalist group
called Jihad that was blamed for Sadat's slaying, led Friday's noon
prayers at the mosque and again urged worshipers to agitate against
the government.
   After the service, Abdel-Rahman led a crowd of 300 to 400
worshipers from the mosque, Mahran said. Police opened fire and
used batons and tear gas against more than 300 rioters after they
fired pistols and hurled stones at police, Mahran said.
   He said a police colonel and three rioters were shot.
   Mahran said authorities decided Saturday to take Al-Shuhada
Mosque from private ownership, put it under control of the Ministry
of Wakfs, or Islamic charities, and appoint a new preacher as a way
to keep Abdel-Rahman from the pulpit.
   Abdel-Rahman was charged with 23 others with the assassination
of Sadat, who was killed at a military parade on Oct. 6, 1981.
Abdel-Rahman was accused of issuing a ruling directing his
followers to kill the president.
   A military court acquitted him and another defendant but
sentenced five to death and the remaining 17 to long prison terms.

   More than a foot of snow blanketed the North Carolina mountains
Saturday while authorities in North Dakota rushed to complete a
series of dikes to protect Fargo from the rising Red River.
   Scorching temperatures continued in California, but the heat was
expected to break Sunday with temperatures in most coastal
districts back down to the 70s and 80s.
   Across the continent, up to 14 inches of snow have accumulated
in Macon County, N.C., and snow also was falling in Maine, New
Hampshire, and in the Rockies.
   Flood warnings were reported in Baton Rouge, La., where the
Mississippi River was 4 feet below flood stage, and throughout the
rest of the South. Flooding also threatened in New England, across
North Dakota and Minnesota and in Indiana, Illinois and Ohio.
   Along the Red River, residents of Fargo and neighboring
Moorhead, Minn., readied for the flood-swollen river's predicted
crest on Monday, 19 feet above flood stage.
   Dean Peterson, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
said work on an extensive network of dikes was virtually completed.
   ``Right now, we're pretty much done ... if everything maintains
the way it is,'' Peterson said Saturday.
   There were scattered rainshowers from northern Arkansas to
northern Illinois, from the central Gulf states to the lower Great
Lakes region, and from Georgia to Virginia.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 2 p.m.
EDT included half an inch at Chattanooga, Tn., .51 inch at
Marietta, Ga., and a third of an inch at Huntsville, Ala.
   Heavier snowfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 2 p.m.
EDT included three inches at Eastport, Maine, and one inch at Mount
Washington, N.H.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies over southern and central Texas and much of the Southwest.
   Temperatures soared into the 90s in south Texas, while readings
dropped into the teens in northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and upper
Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 13
degrees at International Falls, Minn., to 106 degrees at Palm
Springs, Calif.
   Sunday's forecast called for snow from Wyoming through eastern
Colorado to Missouri, over the Great Lakes region and northern New
England. Showers and a few thunderstorms were expected to extend
from the Texas Panhandle to Arkansas, with fair to partly sunny
skies over the rest of the nation and windy conditions in the
mid-Atlantic Coast region.
   High temperatures were expected in the 30s and upper 20s from
the northern and central Plains to New England; above 70 degrees
from California and western Oregon through southern and central
Texas to Florida and southern Georgia; in the 80s across the
Florida peninsula, from central California to south central Texas;
in the 90s or above 100 degrees in Southern California and southern
Arizona.

another month, Belgrade's daily Vecernje Novosti said. The
newspaper said his lawyer's had appealed the decision.
   The court ruling came after prosecutors said an investigation
into charges of counterrevolutionary activity had not been
complete, the newspaper said. The charges carry the death penalty.
   Vlasi, 41, a former Communist Party leader, was arrested in a
crackdown on alleged organizers of ethnic Albanian opposition to
constitutional changes that went into effect March 28.
   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise about 85 percent of Kosovo's
population, say their autonomy is curbed by the changes, which give
predominantly Moslem Serbia more control over the judiciary,
schools and police.
   At least 24 people were killed, 200 injured and dozens others
arrested in clashes between police and demonstrators last month.
Emergency measures, including a dusk-to-dawn curfew, remain in
force.
   According to the newspaper, the curfew will be shortened on
Sunday and schools in Kosovo will reopen on Monday.

<HEAD>St. Joseph Police Use Signs To Demand Raise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOSEPH, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police union has erected signs around
town to express its frustration with low pay and low morale in the
city's police department.
   One sign reads: ``Welcome to St. Joseph. Home Of The Pony
Express And One Of The Lowest Paid Police Depts. In the United
States.''
   Another says: ``St. Joseph, Where the Pony Express Began, Jesse
James Ended &amp; Where Law Enforcement Is Not A Priority.''
   The signs were put up last week by the city's lodge of the
Fraternal Order of Police. The group spent about $3,000 to launch
the citywide sign and bumper sticker campaign.
   Police in the northwest Missouri city of 76,000 have not had a
raise in four years, said lodge President Jerry Ward. Starting pay
for a patrolman ranges from $14,838 to $18,036, which Ward said is
below the pay for similar-size towns. Ward said that because of the
low pay, morale is low and trained officers have looked for other
jobs.
   Bill Euler, a city councilman, sympathizes with the officers but
said the government doesn't have the money. He has a sign at his
office that says ``We support the St. Joseph Police Dept. in their
efforts to obtain better salaries and benefits.''
   Euler, who is chairman of a committee that oversees police
department matters, said the lower salaries were caused partly by
loss of federal revenue sharing and voter rejection of a city
earnings tax. The city also has been forced to close two fire
stations and curtail other city services, he said.
   ``The message is that St. Joseph residents ought to realize we
have a serious problem,'' Euler said. ``We need additional revenue.
... There's no hidden box we can open and say, `By golly, here's a
few million dollars to spend.'''

   Shifting wind set oil from the Exxon
Valdez on a collision course for the nation's No. 1 fishing port,
while the Pentagon on Saturday sent a special team and equipment to
help clean up the giant slick.
   Wind from the southeast and northeast pushed oil toward Kodiak
Island, 300 miles from the site of the nation's worst oil spill two
weeks ago. The direction of the crude raised fears that the port
town of Kodiak, which last year had $166 million worth of catches,
could be polluted within days, officials said.
   ``Geographically, Kodiak is downwind of the (oil) area if there
are east winds,'' National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Keeton
said.
   The stricken tanker, meanwhile, was sitting dead calm in a flat
sea Saturday with a half-dozen smaller boats clustered around it,
steam drifting from its stack, a radar arm rotating and a
helicopter on its deck. The Exxon Valdez is in a protected cove for
emergency repairs.
   An orange boom designed to contain any leaking oil encircled the
987-foot tanker. In every direction beyond the boom, however, long
streamers of congealed oil the color of chocolate milk drifted off
for miles.
   On Friday, President Bush said he would send federal troops to
help with the cleanup and put the federal government virtually in
control of the effort. Bush insisted, however, that ``We are not
federalizing this operation.''
   The new federal authority was apparent Saturday as the Coast
Guard began to move into a command center set up by Exxon in a
Valdez office building.
   ``I think we had a problem with organization _ that's what
frustrated everybody,'' said Rear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr., the
commander of the Coast Guard's Alaskan district. ``We now see a
clean line of what's going to go on.''
   Some Defense Department equipment was already arriving,
including Navy skimmers and oil containment booms.
   A Pentagon ``assessment team'' made up of engineering,
environmental, medical and logistical personnel from bases in
Alaska, Hawaii and Washington, D.C., assembled at the Alaskan Air
Command. It was scheduled to begin work Sunday.
   Meanwhile, however, confusion, complaints and equipment problems
continued to characterize the cleanup.
   At Sawmill Bay, where workers have been struggling for a week to
hold oil away from four salmon hatcheries, a shipment of
containment booms from the U.S. Navy turned out to be only half of
the 16,000 feet promised, and only 24 inches deep instead of 41
inches.
   With favorable weather, however, 41-inch booms won't be
necessary, Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corp. spokesman Bruce
Suzumoto said.
   Fishermen and merchants of the nearby fishing community of
Cordova said Exxon has been slow to process claims, including
compensation for cleanup expenses and the loss of the $12 million
herring season.
   ``Cordova remains a forgotten town,'' said R.S. Kopchek, a local
fisherman. ``We are the people who are hurt the most.''
   The Department of Fish and Game said oil has been spotted about
five miles from Esther Bay, site of world's largest salmon
hatchery. Esther Bay is about 50 miles wst of Valdez, and north of
Sawmill Bay.
   Fish and game officials also announced that autopsies on two
deer originally said to have been killed by oil showed one death
caused by old age and the other by stress.
   In Kodiak, officials have begun daily meetings to make
contingency plans and have expressed concern that there won't be
enough oil containment supplies left for that part of Alaska. The
state has transferred some managers of its cleanup at Valdez to
Kodiak to begin making preparations for a cleanup there.
   ``We're going to try to get down there and break it up if
possible,'' Nelson said.
   Nelson said authorities were sending herring boats with nets and
Coast Guard cutters with water cannons to try to break up the
wind-driven oil before it reaches Kodiak.
   The weather was better around Valdez. High pressure that has
brought a week of favorable weather to the Prince William Sound
area appears to be holding off encroaching fronts that threatened
to blow oil into untainted shorelines and hatcheries.
   The wind pattern created by the high-pressure ridge has pushed
much of the oil away from land and into the Gulf of Alaska, where
it is more likely to break up.
   ``This has been miracle weather,'' said Michelle Hahn O'Leary, a
member of the Cordova District Fishermen United.
   Oil has already traveled over a 3,000-square-mile area. So far,
only an estimated 16,000 barrels, about 7 percent of the 240,000
barrels spilled, has been sopped and vacuumed up. A barrel is 42
gallons.
   The disaster has killed thousands of birds and sea otters along
the central Alaskan coast, cost fishermen millions of dollars in
lost catch and continues to threaten valuable salmon fisheries.
   As the Defense Department worked to set up its cleanup effort,
others continued theirs.
   Though Alaska officials had complained Exxon's handling of the
cleanup was too bureaucratic and too slow, the oil company will
continue to provide materials, manpower and money.
   Fishermen in Prince William Sound, who have spent the past two
weeks defending four salmon fisheries, hoped to use new skimmers
and booms to attack oil trapped in dozens of bays and inlets in the
sound.
   ``The plan is to boom in the oil in places like Snug Harbor and
Herring Bay and then bring in the skimmers to collect the oil,''
said Rick Steiner, a state adviser to the Cordova fishermen's union.
   Doug Mertz, an assistant state attorney general, said a review
of state and federal law indicates Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co., the operator of the trans-Alaska oil-pipeline
terminal, could face fines exceeding $700 million as a result of
the accident in which the Exxon Valdez rammed a reef.
   An environmental group in Alaska said Friday it had received the
state's blessing to establish a fund to assist in the volunteer
wildlife effort, and to monitor Exxon's cleanup progress.
   State officials issued an emergency order Friday to Alyeska,
directing it to correct problems with its oil-spill response
program.
   ``Alaska won't tolerate any more excuses for not responding to
an oil spill, no matter what the size,'' Gov. Steve Cowper said.
   The order requires Alyeska to replace a 12-member spill response
crew disbanded several years ago, acquire by May 15 the best
available equipment and prepare by June 1 a revised
spill-contingency plan for state approval.
   Alyeska has seven days to respond. The company on Thursday
announced its own new plans, which include tug boat escorts and
random drug and alcohol testing.

<TEXT>
   A former second mate under the fired Exxon
captain implicated in the Alaskan oil spill says the skipper was
frequently drunk and failed to follow regulations, according to
reports published Saturday.
   Bruce Amero, who worked for Exxon for eight years, has a $2.075
million lawsuit pending against Exxon in New York state court
charging that Capt. Joseph Hazelwood and other superior officers
harassed him.
   In a lengthy pretrial depostion given 18 months ago, Amero said
that Hazelwood ``constantly ... appeared to be intoxicated'' when
he was in command of the vessel, The Boston Globe reported Saturday.
   Amero said Hazelwood held regular drinking parties in his room
on board ship, and added that he once saw Hazelwood throw four
empty quart bottles of Jack Daniels whiskey overboard.
   ``There's a bad joke in the fleet that it's Captain Hazelwood
and his chief mate, Jack Daniels, that run the ship,'' he said in
the deposition.
   Hazelwood was captain of the Exxon Valdez on March 24 when it
crashed into a reef and spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil
into Prince William Sound in the nation's worst oil spill.
   Hazelwood, 42, faces three misdemeanor charges in Alaska of
operating a ship while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and
negligent discharge of oil. He is free on $25,000 bail after
surrendering last week on Long Island, where he lives.
   Amero, who now lives in Meredith, N.H., also claimed that
Hazelwood ``falsified the deck logbook about fire and boat drills''
aboard his ships, the New York Daily News reported Saturday.
   He told the New York newspaper in a telephone intereview that
``I smelled liquor on him on a number of occasions.''
   The lawsuit, which charges that Amero was treated so badly that
he needed psychiatric treatment, is pending.
   It seeks $2.075 million in personal injury damages from Exxon,
charging that he was ``subjected to abuse and harassment by his
superior officers and other supervisory employes, and in particular
Capt. Joseph Hazelwood.''
   There was no answer Saturday at Amero's home in New Hampshire.
Michael G. Chalos, Hazelwood's attorney, declined to comment on the
lawsuit.
   On March 24, Hazelwood allegedly turned control of the Valdez
over to a third mate uncertified to pilot the vessel in the waters
off Alaska. He was fired by Exxon on March 30 after the National
Transportation Safety Board said tests taken about nine hours after
the disaster showed he was under the influence of alcohol.
   Amero said his problems with Hazelwood began a week after he
first began working under his command.
   ``I was asleep and he was jumping up and down on his floor one
evening screaming at me to come up and drink with him,'' he said in
the deposition quoted in The Boston Globe. He said he refused and
that Hazelwood began harassing him, and that a female seaman told
him that she was sexually harassed by Hazelwood.

   Two Sikhs charged with conspiracy in the
1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi were arrested
Saturday, police said.
   Police Commissioner Arvind Inamdar said Jagmohan Singh Tony, 35,
and Dalip Singh, 55, both college lecturers in Bombay, were
arrested at their homes.
   The men and three other Sikhs were charged Friday in a New Delhi
court with waging war against the state, sedition, criminal
conspiracy, murder and attempted murder.
   Two of the other Sikhs charged are in police custody and the
third was killed in 1985 by rival Sikh militants.
   If convicted, the four still alive face a sentence of death by
hanging.
   Inamdar said the five are accused of plotting Mrs. Gandhi's
assassination and other ``sensational acts to create chaos,
confusion and anarchy,'' as revenge for the June 1984 army raid on
the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holiest shrine.
   They also are accused of organizing the July 1984 hijacking of
an Indian Airlines plane and plotting an abortive assassination of
Mrs. Gandhi and her son Rajiv in September of that year. Rajiv
Gandhi was elected prime minister after his mother's death.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot and killed in the garden of her New Delhi
residence by two Sikh bodyguards on Oct. 31, 1984. One of them was
killed by other bodyguards and the second was convicted of murder
and hanged.
   Another Sikh was convicted of conspircay in the murder and also
hanged.
   The army raid on the Golden Temple was ordered by Mrs. Gandhi to
oust separatist Sikh militants entrenched in the shrine. At least
1,200 people, many of them Sikhs, died in the action.
   Sikh militants began fighting for a separate nation in 1982,
citing discrimination by Hindus, who make up 80 percent of India's
population.
   The campaign has worsened since Mrs. Gandhi's death. In 1988, at
least 2,400 people were killed in Punjab and at least 480 have died
so far this year.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are
in a majority in the northern state of Punjab, which borders
Pakistan.

<HEAD>URI Treated Eight Woman Faculty Unfairly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have found the
University of Rhode Island guilty of violating antidiscrimination
laws in the cases of eight women faculty members, the college
president said.
   The Department of Labor concluded that the college unfairly
failed to promote two female associate professors to the rank of
full professor, according to a report released Friday by URI
President Edward D. Eddy.
   The school was also cited for failures in the areas of granting
maternity leaves, pay equity and job assignments in cases involving
six other women teachers or administrators, the report said.
   Eddy attributed the lapses to ``procedural errors'' and said
remedies had been taken, including the promotion of the two women
who had not been ranked as full professors.
   An investigation found that the university sought more letters
of recommendation when reviewing one woman associate professor for
promotion than it does for ``similarly situated males.'' It also
determined the college did not develop an adequate maternity leave
policy to ensure that women faculty would not be penalized for time
away from work because of childbearing.
   ``These are procedural errors which occured,'' said Eddy.
``There's no clear and concise proof of any pattern of
discrimination.''
   But William Rosen, faculty union president, said the report
shows URI officials ``haven't unlearned their former practices,''
referring to a sex discrimination lawsuit against URI that was
settled for $1.3 million in 1985.
   ``They're jerking people around, mainly women,'' he said.
   The 14-page report was the cullmination of a routine
investigation of URI's affirmative action policies. The Labor
Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance undertakes such
reviews when agencies are slated to receive at least $1 million in
federal grants.
   If URI fails to comply with the report, the Labor Department
could take steps to cut federal funds to the 13,000-student school.
The grants total more than $30 million in research alone.
   Eddy said pay adjustments totaling $6,365 have been awarded to
five of the eight women involved and both associate professors
cited in the report have been promoted, Eddy said.

   Police in this small fishing town tried
to determine Saturday why a masked gunman entered a courthouse
annex and opened fire, killing a justice of the peace and wounding
an assistant police chief.
   ``We're looking at three motives right now, but we haven't
narrowed it down,'' Police Chief Don Gullett said Saturday. He
wouldn't elaborate.
   Justice of the Peace T.J. ``Jack'' Dooley, 79, was shot once in
the heart in the attack at about 2:35 p.m. Friday. Assistant Police
Chief Emmitt Greene, 43, was shot in the upper chest but managed to
return fire and kill the gunman.
   Greene remained in serious condition in the intensive care unit
of the Matagorda General Hospital in Bay City with a bullet lodged
near his spine, Gullett said.
   The slain gunman was identified as Duc Nga Nguyen, 27, from
Garden City, Kan. He had lived in Palacios previously and was
arrested in 1987 for carrying a pistol.
   Officials estimated Nguyen and Greene fired up to 20 shots
during a gun battle that lasted only a few seconds.
   Residents of Palacios, 100 miles southwest of Houston, are
puzzled over the shooting, Gullett said.
   ``The city is in shock. The Vietnamese community is in shock,''
he said. ``My phone was ringing off the wall at home last night.
Many Vietnamese called my wife. Some called me. ... They are
apologizing that this took place. The community as a whole is
remorse.''
   Authorities said Nguyen had been at the courthouse annex earlier
in the day to get a driver's license but left when he was told they
were issued only on Wednesdays.
   When he returned, his face was partly covered by a bandana and
he held a Mauser automatic, which discharges bullets about the size
of those from a .32-caliber pistol.
   Nguyen also wore a backpack that, police later learned,
contained adhesive tape, string and a device that could be used as
a bomb detonator. The pack also contained three pairs of fake
handcuffs, but no bomb, Hurta said.
   Pam Gullett, the police chief's wife who works for the county
tax office and has a desk at the annex, said she knew there was
something wrong as soon as Nguyen walked in.
   ``He yelled at me to stand up. I asked him what he said, and
then the shooting started,'' she said. ``I ducked into a corner,
hoping that the bullets wouldn't go through the wood.''
   Dooley walked in as Nguyen grabbed Dwayne Koenig, 32, who was
standing by the door, authorities said. Nguyen was telling Koenig
and Mrs. Gullett to lay on the floor when Dooley approached them
and was fatally shot. Mrs. Gullett and Koenig were unhurt.
   Greene entered the tax office and ordered Nguyen to drop the
gun. The gunman fired at the 13-year police department veteran,
hitting him in the upper chest. But Greene managed to reload his
.45-caliber revolver and fire several times, striking the gunman in
the head, arm and leg.
   Dooley had been a justice of the peace for 12 years and was
planning to travel to Rome, where he was to meet one of his two
sons, Hurta said. The two were supposed to have an audience with
the Pope.

   High pressure over California weakened
Saturday and let ocean air move onshore, but temperatures still
rose to record levels for early spring. One person apparently died
from the heat.
   ``The beach is packed,'' lifeguard Randy DeGregori said as an
estimated 100,000 people stretched out on Santa Monica Beach in
soothing 77-degree air temperatures or took a cold plunge into the
64-degree water.
   ``The crowd is just unbelievable, you'd think it was the Fourth
of July,'' said lifeguard Lt. Tom Hargett at Hermosa Beach,
watching over part of an estimated 300,000 people lining the sands
of the south Santa Monica Bay.
   ``I had to look at the calendar just to make sure it was
April,'' he said.
   The Los Angeles civic center temperature hit 89 at noon, tying
the April 8 record high established in 1987. Downtown had a
record-tying 100 on Tuesday and record highs of 105 Wednesday, 106
Thursday and 100 Friday.
   The heat contributed to the death of a Los Angeles woman, who
was taken to a hospital with heat exhaustion and later died of a
heart attack, police Sgt. Robert Normandy said.
   Barbara Zavaleta, 50, of Boyle Heights, died Friday evening at
White Memorial Medical Center, he said.
   In the desert, Palm Springs baked in 106-degree heat and the
town of Thermal fried at 105 by noon. Elsewhere, central and
southern areas of the state had noon readings in the high 80s and
90s.
   The highest temperatures moved into the inland valleys and to
the desert as the normal cooling sea breezes reasserted themselves
and kept most of the coastal highs in the 70s, 80s and 90s rather
than the triple-digit range.
   Throngs packed the beaches from Los Angeles to San Diego
throughout the week, and lifeguard agencies have had to call in
their troops to handle crowds rivaling those of summer.
   ``This is an early start,'' DeGregori said. ``We do get some
good (spring) weather, but this is something that you'd see in the
first week of July and the end of June.
   ``Every day this week, and today is no exception, we've used
every man available,'' he said.
   Lifeguards made hundreds of rescues during the week, Hargett
said.
   Southern California beaches are still uneven from the winter
waves, with deep holes lurking beneath the early spring surf, and
riptides.
   ``We've had rips running 2, 3, 400 yards out, like a freight
train grabbing people and yanking 'em right out,'' Hargett said.
Riptides run opposite to the ordinary flow and can pull people
seaward.
   Downtown Los Angeles got the first indication of a return to
normal when the overnight low fell to 67 by 5 a.m. Saturday, the
first time the temperature had dropped below 70 since Tuesday.

   A Soviet flag fluttering over a paper
factory made some employees see red, but organizers of a weekend
visit to town by five Soviet women said Saturday the flag was a
friendly greeting.
   International Paper Co. always runs up foreign flags for
overseas visitors, said spokesman Gary O'Rielly.
   Valentina Matvienko, vice mayor of Leningrad and leader of the
delegation, said the women appreciated the gesture and were
``grateful to the citizens of Pine Bluff for their hospitality and
friendliness toward our delegation.''
   Employees circulated a petition Friday questioning the flying of
the flag, but did not get a response from the plant's management.
O'Rielly said he never saw a petition.
   Paper worker Albert Bolls said it was upsetting to see the flag
when he ended his shift Friday night.
   ``I don't think there ought to be a Russian flag flying over an
American plant. I'm a veteran and I don't like it. Russia is a
communist country and we're not,'' Bolls said.
   Another employee, Cathy Yiengst, said she understood the gesture
but didn't think it was necessary. ``I don't think you'd see an
American flag flying in their country,'' she said.
   Ms. Matvienko said that when Americans visit the Soviet Union,
``we also greet them by putting up their flags and regard it as a
sign of friendship.''
   O'Rielly said the firm had flown the flags of delegations from
other countries, including Japan and Finland, when they toured the
plant.
   The women had considered touring the mill on Saturday, but opted
instead for shopping at a local mall, said Marion Kahn of the
Soviet-American Women's Exchange, organizers of the Soviet women's
11-day tour of Arkansas.
   The decision had nothing to do with the workers' grumbling about
the flag, Ms. Kahn said.
   Ms. Kahn said she hoped the plant workers would look beyond
differences between the two nations.
   ``I can understand that some people might feel the way they do,
and that's the whole point of the trip _ for us to get to know each
other on a person-to-person level,'' Ms. Kahn said.
   ``The flying of the flag is certainly not a political statement.
We are trying to create friendships.''

   Former President Jose Figueres, who
in 1948 abolished Costa Rica's armed forces, is gravely ill in a
local hospital and has received the last rites, his doctor said
Saturday.
   Dr. Jaime Gutierrez said the 83-year-old ex-president was
admitted Friday night to San Juan de Dios Hospital after suffering
severe chest pains.
   He said Figueres ``is in the coronary unit and we are afraid he
might die.''
   Another doctor, who asked not to be identified by name, said
Figueres' condition was worsening.
   ``His heart cannot take a pacemaker. His situation is worsening
because he has a pulmonary infection and also has an inflamation in
a vein in one of his legs,'' the doctor said.
   Alberto Casals, a Roman Catholic priest, told reporters at the
hospital that he had delivered last rites to the man considered by
many to be the father of democracy in Costa Rica.
   Five of Figueres' six children and his two former wives were at
the hospital along with some government officials, hospital sources
reported.
   An adviser to President Oscar Arias said the president may cut
short a trip to Canada if Figueres' condition continues to worsen.
   In 1948, after allegedly fraudulent elections, Figueres went
into the hills with a band of rebels and led a brief but bloody
revolution that overthrew President Fernando Calderon Guardia who
had allied himself with the Communist Party.
   Figueres took over as president of a provisional junta for a
year, banning the communists and overseeing the writing of a new
constitution that provided increased social services.
   He also abolished the armed forces, making Costa Rica the only
nation in Latin America _ and one of the few in the world _ without
a military. Since then Costa Rica has been Central America's most
enduring democracy.
   Figueres served a second presidential term from 1953 to 1958 and
a third from 1970 to 1974.

<HEAD>Convicted Drug Dealer Arrested In Slaying Of Anti-Drug Grocer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted drug dealer who feuded with a
neighborhood grocer has been arrested and charged with
masterminding the slaying of the outspoken anti-drug crusader,
police said.
   Bobbie Lee Robinson, 29, was arrested Friday night and charged
with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted
first-degree murder.
   One bystander was critically wounded and another managed to
dodge bullets in the machine-gun attack outside Lee Arthur
Lawrence's West Perrine grocery March 20.
   Lawrence, 51, died in a spray of 30 bullets that residents of
West Perrine say came in retaliation for his outspoken efforts
against drug dealers in the low-income community about 10 miles
south of Miami. Police also pursued the theory that the slaying was
the latest in an ongoing drug-related feud.
   Less than a week before he died, Lawrence reported to police a
death threat. His family said it was Robinson who threatened to
kill the grocer.
   ``Mr Robinson was in fact the party who paid the other subjects
that were involved to kill Mr. Lawrence,'' said Metro-Dade police
spokeswoman Lisette Williams.
   Two men are already in custody and another suspect is still
being sought.
   Metro-Dade Sgt. Ted MacArthur, supervisor of the homicide
investigating team, said he won't release the motive or the murder
fee until the remaining suspect has been arrested. But he said late
Friday that Robinson contracted with Rodney Newsome and Ronnie
Johnson to kill Lawrence.
   Newsome and Johnson, both 21, were arrested last week.
   Robinson has been charged seven times in five years with
felonies, including a 1984 conviction in Louisiana for possession
of cocaine with intent to sell. He was given five years' probation.

   A man armed with a pistol and rifle
walked onto an elementary school playground and threatened a
teacher and police officers, then shot himself to death, police
said.
   A dispatcher said the Brigham City Police Department received a
call at 7:10 p.m. Friday that an armed man was approaching the
playground at Foothill Elementary School.
   Police officers found the man walking among children and adults
in the area and talked him into moving away from the crowd. Then,
police said, the man threatened one of the officers with his rifle.
   ``In the midst of negotiations, with officers standing
approximately 10 feet away from the suspect, the suspect turned the
rifle on himself,'' the statement said.
   The man was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. His name
had not been released late Saturday.
   Wayne Bowcutt, a sixth-grade teacher at the school, said he and
another teacher witnessed the shooting.
   ``It was a terrible thing,'' he said. ``(The police) did
everything in their power to try to get him to give up the gun.''
   Bowcutt said the man had turned a pistol on a female teacher and
threatened her. The woman's husband then told him to take the gun
off his wife, Bowcutt said.
   ``Then I grabbed the kids and she grabbed the kids and we took
them into the (school) building into the classroom to get them away
from the man,'' he said.
   Bowcutt said there were about 10 children in the area, as well
as several adults when the man arrived at the school.
   Three times in the past year, adults with guns have killed
elementary schoolchildren in seemingly random attacks.
   In January, Patrick Purdy killed five children and wounded 30
other people when he sprayed a schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., with
bullets from a semiautomatic weapon. He later killed himself.
   Last September, two 8-year-olds were killed and seven other
pupils and two teachers were wounded when a man opened fire on a
school in Greenwood, S.C. And last May, a woman shot and killed an
8-year-old and wounded five other children School in Winnetka,
Ill., before wounding an adult and killing herself.

   Would-be scientists who took a wrong
turn on the road to enlightenment wound up in their own little
corner at the mecca of knowledge known as MIT, enshrined in the
Archives of Useless Research.
   The archives, a compendium of crackpot theories also known as
the ``nut collection,'' preserve 200 books, drawings and pamphlets
by brave laymen who sought to explain things like ``Why Life Exists
and Allied Subjects.''
   But archivist Kathy Marquis says the weird science doesn't
entirely clash with the serious science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, since both stem from people's desire to
explain their existence.
   ``We want to collect basically not only what worked but what
didn't work,'' she said.
   At least two of the theorists from the 1920s, '30s and '40s were
borne out by later scientists, warning that cigarette smoking could
be linked to cancer. But it's the really useless that dominates,
not the musings of the ahead-of-their-time, misunderstood geniuses.
   There is Cyrus Teed, who advanced the theory that people are
living inside Earth. And there is Seabury Doane Brewer, who
determined that the sun is actually 600 miles away from Earth, as
opposed to the 93 million miles generally accepted by astronomers.
   Titles of the mainly self-published works are ambitious.
   ``The Fact of All Life,'' ``Beyond Einstein,'' ``Why Life Exists
and Allied Subjects,'' are among the sticky issues bravely tackled.
   Explaining the meaning of life is a key theme of the authors,
along with debunking scientific beliefs such as the existence of
gravity, and finding proof for religious beliefs.
   ``My own theory is these are the same kind of people who in
another circumstance might have found their one answer in
religion,'' Marquis said. ``I think that's a lot of what drives
science anyway. We want to know why.''
   The collection was donated to MIT by an editor of Scientific
American. It also includes crank mail sent to MIT scientists over
the years, Marquis said.
   Most of the authors take a bombastic approach. But some are more
modest, such as Ernest E. Sowell, who titled his 1938 work ``A
Layman's Guess or The Universal Electric Life Theory.''
   Sowell noted he lacked scientific training and admits that some
might think him presumptuous. ``However, there is an impelling
desire on my part to do this,'' he wrote.
   The ``impelling desire'' to explain the unexplainable is an
integral part of science, Marquis said.
   ``The successful guys think about impossible things and try to
explain them,'' she said. ``These guys just kept thinking about
impossible things.''

   A man received a new heart after living a record
132 days with a device that helped his ailing heart pump blood.
   Louis Wilson, a 39-year-old paper mill worker from Winnfield,
La., was feeling well enough to sit up in bed for an hour Saturday,
two days after his transplant operation, his wife, Carolyn, said.
   Finding a proper heart donor for Wilson was difficult because of
his large size and type B blood, doctors at Texas Heart Institute
said. Officials at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital didn't identify
the donor other than to say the person was from the Houston area.
   Dr. Bud Frazier, director of the institute's cardiac transplant
program, said Wilson, who is 6 feet tall and weighed 210 pounds
when he was outfitted with the heart pump, was ``doing fine'' after
Thursday's transplant.
   Wilson is thought to have survived longer than any other patient
who has used a stationary heart assist pump, which serves much the
same function as an artificial heart while the patient awaits a
transplant. The pump, however, assists rather than replaces the
heart.
   Wilson was hospitalized Nov. 21 with ischemic cardimyopathy, a
degenerative condition that prevents his heart from pumping enough
blood.
   On Nov. 25, a team led by Dr. O.H. Frazier implanted the
air-powered heart assist pump into his abdomen.

<HEAD>City Asks Court To Declare Mobil Refinery A Public Nuisance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials asked a court to declare
the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery here a public nuisance following a
series of mishaps that have killed three people and injured dozens
since 1987.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges
the ``potential for massive disaster'' at the 750-acre refinery,
with the city especially fearing the uncontrolled release of toxic
hydrofluoric acid.
   The complaint asks the court to bar Mobil from polluting the air
with the acid and other toxic chemicals and order the company to
safely operate the refinery in southern Los Angeles County. The
facility produces about 12 percent of Southern California's
gasoline.
   Officials in this city of 140,000 people did not say in detail
what actions they might take if the court issued such an order.
   Mobil officials had not seen the lawsuit late Friday and
declined to comment on the specific allegations.
   Scientists say a 1,000-gallon hydrofluoric acid spill could
produce a lethal toxic cloud capable of spreading over a five-mile
range.
   The lawsuit was the city's latest attempt to respond to a series
of fires, explosions and other problems that have claimed three
lives at the refinery since 1987.
   A consultant's report in January blamed carelessness and lax
management for what it called an ``unacceptable'' number of
problems at the facility since 1987.
   In November, the federal government cited Mobil and nine of its
contractors for 100 safety violations and recommended fines
totaling $30,040. Mobil officials are contesting the federal
findings.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The military government of Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril said Saturday that loyal troops crushed a mutiny
after two days of fighting and that most of the rebel soldiers were
captured.
   ``The soldiers of the Presidential Guard presently occupy the
Dessalines Barracks,'' said a statement issued by the army
adjutant, Gen. Andre Jean-Pierre, and read on state-run radio.
   It said most of the rebels in the barracks were captured but
some fled and left behind their uniforms and weapons.
   The communique did not say how many rebels were captured or had
escaped. The normal force of the Dessalines Barracks is 750
soldiers.
   Loyal soldiers shelled the barracks Friday night and resumed the
artillery bombardment Saturday morning. There also were firefights
in the area of the barracks, which adjoin the National Palace in
the center of Port-au-Prince.
   Casualty figures for Saturday's fighting were not available.
   A source close to the government said 17 soldiers, all thought
to be rebels, were killed in Friday's fighting. Haitians monitoring
military radio broadcasts said reports indicated the Presidential
Guard suffered 15 casualties but there was no breakdown of dead and
wounded.
   The state hospital said at least one civilian was killed Friday
and unconfirmed reports put the civilian death toll at three.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said it was believed two
Presidential Guard soldiers were killed Saturday.
   ``The casualty figures apparently are going to be lower than the
level of noise might have indicated,'' she said.
   Port-au-Prince remained calm after the government claimed
victory.
   Its communique said the captured rebels implicated drug
traffickers in efforts to overthrow Avril that began April 2 with
an attempted coup. It said an anti-government plot was organized by
Haitian exiles formerly associated with the ousted regime of
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier.
   The statement also claimed the mastermind of the revolt was
former Interior Minister Roger Lafontant, who is now living in the
Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti.
   The statement was issued at 5:15 p.m. EDT after several hours of
heavy shelling of the barracks. Shooting had tapered off shortly
before the announcement.
   U.S. officials said earlier that a hole was blown in the roof of
the gleaming white National Palace, which serves as the
presidential residence.
   It was believed the damage was caused by a mortar shell fired
about a mile away by rebels who fled the barracks Friday night and
took over a Roman Catholic church compound.
   Diplomats had said Friday night it appeared Avril's troops had
gained the upper hand and driven the rebels from the compound. But
fierce firefights broke out again Saturday.
   Reports Saturday morning said members of the Leopards commando
unit who had been involved in the mutiny were seen removing their
uniforms. Witnesses said they abandoned their base in the capital's
suburbs.
   There were no reports of fighting elsewhere in Haiti.
   The rebels accuse Avril's government, which took power in a
military coup six months ago, of favoritism toward the Presidential
Guard in pay and living conditions. They also said the government
was arbitrarily dismissing senior officers in a U.S.-supported
crackdown on drugs and corruption.
   In the attempted coup on April 2, rebel soldiers seized Avril
and took him to the airport for deportation but he was rescued by
loyalist soldiers.
   Avril went on television Monday to claim the rebellion had been
put down. However, rebel soldiers continued to roam the capital,
clashing with government forces.
   Avril, 50, came to power in September 1988 in a coup by
non-commissioned officers that ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. The
officers demanded democratic reform and an end to state-sponsored
violence.
   Namphy had deposed a short-lived civilian government. He had
earlier led a junta that took over after Jean-Claude Duvalier was
swept from power in a popular uprising and fled to France in
February 1986.
   The government blamed the attempted coup earlier this month on
people opposed to both democratic change and a ``campaign against
drug trafficking, contraband and corruption.''
   The United States has made the drug crackdown a condition for
restoring $70 million in aid that it suspended after thugs
massacred 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting Haiti's first free
elections in more than 30 years.

<HEAD>Exxon Dealers Sue Company, Say They're Cheated Out of Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An angry group of Texas Exxon service station
owners filed suit against the oil giant, charging that Exxon's
manipulative practices take profits from dealers and saddle
consumers with high fuel prices.
   The 19 Exxon dealers, most from the Houston area, charged the
nation's largest oil marketer with 15 counts of civil violations of
Texas antitrust and deceptive trade practices laws.
   The lawsuit was filed Friday in state district court. A
spokesman for the dealers' group said the action was unrelated to
the Exxon Valdez oil disaster in Alaska.
   ``We finally had enough of it, and we're fighting back,'' said
the spokesman, Exxon dealer Clyde Hall of Pasadena, Texas.
   An Exxon spokesman did not answer a telephone call from The
Associated Press on Saturday.
   The lawsuit seeks more than $5 million in actual damages and
unspecified punitive damages.
   Hall and his fellow dealers complained that Exxon favors select
franchises with ``sweetheart'' rents, interferes with dealers'
ability to buy gasoline cheaper from wholesalers and has rigid
rules for the inheritance of dealers' stations when they die.
   Exxon is the second oil company sued by its dealers in the last
six months. Last September, Texaco was hit with a suit on a
separate set of complaints by a band of dealer franchises in
Houston federal court.
   ``Is this the last of this type of suit you're going to see?
No,'' said Glenn Nilsson, executive director of the Lone Star
Service Stations Association, a dealer lobby.
   Lone Star lobbyist Wayne Konitshek, who helped the Exxon dealers
coordinate their suit, said more than 80 lawsuits for similar
alleged franchise violations are pending in nine states.
   Herb Fortson, attorney for the Exxon and Texaco dealers' suit,
said it took more than nine months to gather evidence and prepare
the Exxon suit.
   ``None of these dealers likes to fight their suppliers,'' he
said. ``But when the supplier is taking money out of their pockets
and favoring (a few) dealers, they have no choice.''

   A pickup truck collided with a Burlington
Northern freight train Saturday afternoon, killing three people in
the truck and leaving a fourth in critical condition.
   After the accident, authorities discovered that one of the train
cars was leaking a chemical fertilizer, ammonium thiosulfate. The
leak was unrelated to the accident, officials said.
   Edward Fowler, an employee of the Amcare ambulance service, said
no one was exposed to the chemical.
   Fowler said the fourth person in the truck was taken in critical

   Identities of the victims were not immediately available, but
one was a child, authorities said.
   The collision occurred at an unguarded crossing in Oklahoma City
late Saturday afternoon.

<TEXT>
   Preliminary laboratory tests showed nothing
to indicate that a nuclear-powered Soviet submarine released
radiation after it caught fire and sank, Norwegian scientists said
Sunday.
   Early results of tests for radioactive contamination in air and
surface water samples from the accident area showed no radiation
from the sub, the government's Institute for Radiation Protection
said in a statement.
   ``These tests checked to see if the Soviet sub released
radiation on or near the surface of the ocean, but cannot exclude
the possibility of such a leak deeper in the ocean,'' said
researcher Per Strand of the institute.
   He said the tests will continue. They involve examining
scrapings from Norwegian Orion reconnaissance aircraft that flew in
the region immediately after the accident Friday and seawater
collected near the site.
   A Norwegian research vessel on Sunday will take new samples from
deeper waters to assess the possibility of the sub having emitted
radiation as it sank towards the seabed, Strand said.
   Norwegian military officers said the submarine caught fire and
went down in international waters 120 miles southwest of Norway's
Bear Island and about 310 miles west of Tromsoe, on Norway's
northern coast. As many as 50 crew members may have died, officials
said.
   Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst said he believed the risk
of radiation contamination was slight.
   Soviet officials said there was no danger of contamination. They
confirmed there were deaths but did not provide casualty figures or
details about the explosion, the third serious Soviet sub accident
in 2{ years.
   The vessel, one of the Soviets' most advanced, was capable of
carrying more than a dozen long-range missiles, according to U.S.
officials.
   Vadime Rosanov, Soviet press attache in Oslo, told Norwegian
television the sub was carrying only torpedoes, but he declined to
say whether the vessel was equipped with any nuclear weapons.
   The ship normally carries a crew of about 95. From observations
by a Norwegian reconnaissance air crew, the Norwegian Defense
Ministry estimated 40 to 50 men were picked up by Soviet vessels,
and it was unclear if all survived.
   ``It's a matter of mathematics,'' said Maj. John Berg, a
military spokesman. ``You have a potential of 50 or more'' who died.
   The submarine reportedly caught fire while submerged. A
Norwegian Defense Ministry statement said that after the ship
surfaced the fire spread from one section to several others and set
off an explosion. The ship then began to list and sink.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev assured Norway the
vessel's reactor was shut down before it sank and that there was no
risk of radiation.
   ``According to the opinion of experts, the possibility of a
nuclear explosion and radioactive pollution of the environment is
excluded,'' Gorbachev wrote in a message to Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland. He sent similar messages to the United States
and Britain.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the sub sank in water more than
4,500 feet deep. Tass quoted Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov as
saying survivors were taken on board a Soviet warship that was
bound for the Arctic port of Murmansk.
   Norway's foreign minister, Thorvald Stoltenberg, criticized the
Soviet failure to quickly inform Norway of the accident.
   ``It's clear that the information came too late,'' Stoltenberg
said in a radio interview.
   Tass said the fire broke out at 11:41 a.m. Friday and the sub
sank about 5{ hours later.
   A Norwegian spokesman said Oslo was officially told of the
accident nearly nine hours after the sinking and only after the
Foreign Ministry in Oslo contacted the Soviet Embassy.
   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said the
Soviets notified it of the sub accident early Saturday and that the
Soviets said there was no danger of a nuclear explosion or
radioactive contamination.
   Soviet officials were criticized for not providing accurate or
timely information after the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that sent a cloud of radiation
into the atmosphere, contaminating crops and livestock in Europe.
   U.S. officials in Washington said the sub apparently belonged to
a type nicknamed ``Mike.'' If that is correct, the ship was
launched in 1983 and was built to carry 16 long-range missiles.
   In London, Paul Beaver, an expert with Jane's Defense Data, told
the British Broadcasting Corp. that the sub was highly advanced.
   ``As far as we can see, it's a new design which is there to test
propulsion systems, sensor systems, weapon systems and even hull
design. It's really a prototype for what has come after it,'' he
said.
   The accident was in strategic waters frequented by the Soviet
and NATO navies. For the Soviets, the waters are the exit route of
its massive Northern Fleet, stationed on the Kola Peninsula in the
Barents Sea.

<HEAD>Foreign Policy Report to Bush Recommends No Major Initiatives Regarding
Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major foreign policy report to President
Bush advises no major new initiatives toward the Soviet Union, an
administration official said Saturday.
   Bush asked his advisers to ``take another look another time at
the whole situation'' after receiving recommendations on relations
with the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and East-West relations,
said the official. The trio of reports are part of a major foreign
policy review Bush initiated as he took office in January.
   In relations with the Soviet Union, ``I don't see anything
new,'' the official said, adding that there apparently was ``not
much to change right now.'' The reports were given to Bush during
meetings of the National Security Council over the past 10 days,
the official said.
   The reports recommended some changes, including new measures
involving an easing of pressure on Poland, the official said,
adding that regarding Afghanistan, the most likely option was to
break off diplomatic relations with the government in Kabul. The
official did not give further details.
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that
the president's advisers suggested that he maintain a middle course
allowing him to view the policies of Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev skeptically while responding with some bold foreign
policy initiative of his own.
   The administration experts recommended a ``status-quo plus''
stance toward the many changes occurring under Gorbachev in the
Soviet Union, the Times said.
   The Washington Post said in its Sunday editions that the three
reports determined that the administration should closely follow
current policies toward Europe and the Soviet Union set by former
President Reagan.
   The Post reported that some senior administration officials
expressed frustration with what they considered a complacent view
of world affairs reflected in the reports. However, it said other
officials praised the process that produced the reports, saying
they were less rancorous than interagency meetings conducted during
the Reagan administration.
   One official said the report on the Soviet Union urged that U.S.
policy ``should not be designed either to help or hurt'' Gorbachev,
the Post said.
   The Times said the classified analyses were prepared by the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the Pentagon and
the staff of the National Security Council. They concluded that
changes in the Soviet Union would continue throughout the Bush
administration even if Gorbachev were replaced with another Soviet
leader, the Times reported.
   Bush and some of his top assistants, National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Security Adviser Robert Gates, have been
skeptical of some of the changes in the Soviet Union. But that
approach has been criticized by some experts as too cautious at a
time when the Soviet Union is undergoing monumental change that
could dramatically alter American-Soviet relations, the Times
reported.
   ``The real debate in the administration will be between the two
centrist positions _ the stand-pat school and the
seize-the-opportunity school,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., told the
Times.
   The report to the White House suggested that the president could
pursue dialogue for the two superpowers to combat terrorism jointly
and slow the spread of chemical weapons, the Times said.

<HEAD>Democrat Readies Ethics Complaint Against Gingrich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arkansas Democrat circulated an ethics
complaint among his Democratic colleagues Friday charging House
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich with nine alleged violations of House
rules.
   The complaint, drawn up by Rep. Bill Alexander, will be filed
formally with the House ethics committee early next week, Alexander
spokesman Lee Powell said. Committee members were given advance
copies of the complaint Friday, he said.
   Under House rules, the formal filing of such a complaint by
Alexander will force the ethics committee to take a vote on whether
to launch an investigation of Gingrich, a Georgia Republican.
   Alexander's action was seen as the beginning of a Democratic
counteroffensive against Gingrich, who last year filed the ethics
complaint that resulted in a lengthy investigation of Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas.
   The ethics committee, known formally as the House Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, is nearing the conclusion of its
investigation of Wright and is expected to decide as early as next
week whether to charge him with violations of House rules.
   The nine allegations in Alexander's complaint center on an
unusual promotional deal for Gingrich's 1984 book, ``Window of
Opportunity.'' Details of the deal were disclosed last month, just
before House Republicans elected Gingrich to their number two
leadership position.
   On Friday, Gingrich said the complaint was ``clearly another
Democratic smear, and in this case a pathetically, poorly done
one.'' He said Alexander's complaint was poorly researched and
riddled with factual errors.
   ``It is certainly Mr. Alexander's right to file with the ethics
committee,'' Gingrich said. ``In this case, it so clearly is an
unresearched and unprepared document, and it so clearly demeans and
distorts the ethics process that I hope that respectable and
responsible Democrats will intervene.''
   The deal involved 21 investors who put $5,000 each into a
partnership formed to promote the book. In return for their
investment, the partners were promised half the publisher's
profits, but the publisher ended up losing money on the book and
the investors got a tax writeoff.
   Gingrich's wife, Marianne Gingrich, who co-authored the book,
has said she received less than $10,000 of the $105,000 raised by
the partnership for arranging the deal and coordinating the
promotional effort. She also received a $26 tax benefit from her
share of the partnership.
   Mrs. Gingrich said last month that the ethics committee had been
consulted before the partnership contracts were signed to ensure
that the arrangement did not violate any House rules.
   Alexander contends in the complaint that the promotional deal
may have violated House rules limiting outside earned income and
gifts that a member can receive. He said the deal also may have
violated House rules governing the use of campaign funds and
government resources and requiring disclosure of travel
reimbursements.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer-songwriter Clyde Moody, a former
Grand Ole Opry regular whose country music career spanned five
decades, died in a Nashville hospital Friday. He was 74.
   Moody had been in and out of Nashville Memorial Hospital for
treatment of an aortic aneurysm, but never fully recovered from
surgery several weeks ago to correct the problem, said hospital
spokeswoman Missy Hubner.
   ``He performed the night he went to the hospital. He never
stopped performing and writing,'' said Aubrey Mayhew, who published
all of Moody's more than 120 compositions and produced his records
for 20 years.
   Moody, who left his North Carolina mountain home at 14 to play
guitar, performed for President Truman after his ``Shenandoah
Waltz'' became a million-seller in 1948. He wore out 21 Cadillacs
performing throughout the South.
   ``I've never gone any place where I couldn't go back,'' Moody
told The Associated Press in a 1984 interview. ``I never mistreated
anybody.''
   Moody, whose specialty was waltz music, got his start in 1934
singing on a Spartanburg, S.C., radio show. He had many hits in the
1940s and '50s, playing with country music legends Roy Acuff,
Ernest Tubb and Bill Monroe.
   Eventually he went by the title of ``the country and western
waltz king'' and became a regular at the Grand Ole Opry.
   Moody also sang with a young Elvis Presley in 1955 when Presley
manager Tom Parker paired them in a six-week tour.
   ``He (Parker) wanted him to get some exposure and to meet
everybody,'' Moody recalled in 1984. ``He was a nice kid.''
   Moody lived in Ashland City and is survived by his wife,
Eleatha, and daughter, Debbie Summers.

<UNK>Three U.S. Servicemen Discover Suspected Rebel Bomb Trap</UNK>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three American soldiers found what
was believed to be a communist rebel bomb trap on a road near Clark
Air Base, a U.S. Air Force spokeswoman said Friday.
   Capt. Donna Eggleston said the servicemen detected the suspected
trap Thursday in the village of Sapang Bato when they found a wire
running across a road that leads to a firing range near the base.
   The base, run by the United States, is about 50 miles north of
Manila.
   In Manila, President Corazon Aquino met with a U.S. delegation
evaluating human rights in the Philippines and said she regretted
that her government's rights record was viewed as no better than
that of Ferdinand Marcos.
   In the southern Philippines, a Roman Catholic priest and a
village official were shot to death by a soldier, church officials
said.
   Ms. Eggleston said the American soldiers were on their way to
the firing range when they spotted the wires on the road and turned
back to report their discovery to base authorities.
   When American and Filipino troops went to the area, they found
that the wires had been removed.
   Local police said the incident could have been a rebel plot
since members of the Communist New People's Army operate in the
area.
   In October 1987, communist rebels killed two American soldiers,
a retired U.S. Air Force soldier and a Filipino of U.S. descent in
almost simultaneous attacks near Clark. There had been no attacks
on Americans since then.
   In Manila, presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said Mrs.
Aquino told a group of attorneys from Minnesota that her
government's human rights record has improved despite criticism
that violations are similar to those under Marcos' 20-year rule.
The lawyers were completing a 12-day tour of the country.
   ``The fact is we have restored democracy and that is the most
important factor,'' she said.
   Fraser, in a telephone interview with the Associated Press,
agreed.
   ``She reaffirmed her own commitmnet to human rights, but I think
the problem is how to translate this commitmnet to the lower levels
of the government out in the field,'' he said.
   Amnesty International and other human rights groups have accused
the military of continued human rights violations during Mrs.
Aquino's administration.
   On Mindanao island, the Rev. Dionisio Malalay and a village
councilman were gunned down Thursday in the town of Tabina, about
520 miles southeast of Manila, a church official in Manila said.
   The Rev. Dwight Calaar said Malalay was talking with councilman
Rufino Rivera when a Philippine Constabulary soldier and a
militiaman passed by and started an argument with Rivera.
   Malalay tried to intervene and the soldier shot him, Calaar
said. The militiaman then shot Rivera, he said.
   The Constabulary regional headquarters reported the shooting as
an ambush by communist New People's Army rebels.

<HEAD>Serial Rapist Sentenced to Record Term Gets 24 Years More</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Friday tacked on 24 years to the
376-year prison term of a serial rapist after a prosecutor
requested a harsh term as a ``nice wedding present'' to the man's
latest victim.
   Quintin Wortham received the 376-year sentence last year in six
other sexual assault cases. He was sentenced Friday to 16 years for
second-degree burglary and 24 years for sexual assault.
   Pitkin County District Judge J.E. DeVilbiss said the sentences
would run concurrently, despite Denver prosecutor Craig Silverman's
exhortation to make the sentences consecutive for the rape victim
on her wedding Saturday.
   ``Tomorrow, she's getting married, and I think 40 years would be
a very nice wedding present for her,'' said Silverman.
   DeVilbiss said crimes arising from the same criminal episode
should run concurrently. But the judge did order the 24-year
sentence to be served consecutively with the previous sentence,
which was the longest prison sentence ever handed down in a
Colorado courtroom.
   Wortham, 34, was convicted of the burglary and sexual assault
charges on Feb. 16. The charges stemmed from an attack on a Denver
woman at her home on June 2, 1985.
   Wortham has maintained his innocence and said he would appeal
the case as well as his previous convictions.

   A former city attorney was sentenced
Friday to 90 days in jail and four ex-commissioners got two years'
probation on convictions for guaranteeing themselves jobs in
settling a federal voting-rights lawsuit.
   In addition to the jail sentence, attorney Wendell Wright was
fined $5,000, said Vermilion County State's Attorney Craig
DeArmond. ``He was the prime mover in the conspiracy,'' he said,
``the guy who orchestrated the whole thing.''
   Former commissioners Wilbur Scharlau, Ernie Cox, Jerome Brown
and Raymond Randall each were sentenced to two years' unsupervised
probation, fined $1,000 each and forfeited their pension rights and
jobs with the city.
   The sentences were handed down by Circuit Judge Paul Komada. But
the penalties were stayed and the defendants released on bond
pending appeal of the case, DeArmond said.
   The men were convicted in February of conflict of interest,
conspiracy and violation of a municipal code that bars entering
into a contract for personal gain. All but Wright also were
convicted of official misconduct.
   The case stems from a 1987 lawsuit filed under the federal
Voting Rights Act. The parties reached a settlement that guaranteed
the commissioners city jobs for three years after the city adopted
a new form of government.
   The lawsuit alleged that Danville's longtime mayor-commissioner
form of government discriminated against blacks. The city held
at-large elections of the commissioners who headed city departments
and formed the City Council.
   Under the settlement, council members represent newly outlined
city wards.
   Aldermanic elections were held in December 1987 and two blacks
were among those elected _ the first blacks to serve on the council
since the old system was adopted 60 years earlier.
   The settlement also specified that Scharlau, Cox, Randall and
Brown would have jobs as department heads for three years in the
new system.

   Gunmen may have attempted to kill
a colleague of slain Amazonian ecologist Chico Mendes, police
reported Friday.
   Federal police chief Orion Alves said shots were fired Thursday
night at the home of Osmarino Amancio, president of the rubber
tappers union, in the jungle town of Brasileia 2,700 miles
northwest of Rio and on the border with Bolivia.
   ``We are aware of a possible assassination attempt and gunshots
outside his house but we don't know who fired them,''Alves said by
telephone from Rio Branco, the Acre state capital 155 miles from
Brasileia.
   He said Amancio was not hurt.
   Amancio, who has reported frequent death threats, is under
constant guard by four policemen, according to Alves.
   Amancio and Mendes led rubber tappers in movements to prevent
ranchers from cutting down virgin forests for pasture land.
   Mendes, a union leader who became a world-renowned ecological
consultant on rain forests, was shot to death Dec. 22 at his home
in Xapuri 40 miles northeast of Brasileia. A local cattle rancher
and his sons have been arrested and charged with the killing.

   Crews tackling the worst oil spill in U.S.
history got good news from Washington on who's in charge of the
cleanup and bad news from a weather forecast that could put
untainted shoreline in jeopardy.
   Only 7 percent of the 10.1 million gallons of oil has been

   President Bush announced Friday he was sending military troops
to help clean up the oil that leaked from tanker Exxon Valdez on
March 24. Bush said the Coast Guard was taking control of the
operation.
   Under the new plan, reached by compromise at the request of
Alaskan officials, the Coast Guard will have final responsibility
for running the cleanup effort. Exxon will continue to provide the

   President Bush says he wants ``complete

   ``The job of cleaning up the oil from both the sea and the
affected land areas will be massive, prolonged and frustrating,''
Bush said Friday as he put the government in virtual control of the
operation.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, tapped to mobilize

States government have been put at my disposal'' to ensure that the
area is returned to its pristine condition ``and I plan to use
them.''
   Administration sources, declining to be identified, said

   Darman had been pressured to act against the survey by a few

   March leaders say the demonstration on Sunday will launch a

   The 20-minute videotape ``Abortion: For Survival'' includes
footage of a woman undergoing an abortion to show the procedure is
``safe and simple'' and the indiscernible remains taken from the
uterus in a first-trimester abortion.
   The videotape ``puts it where it's at,'' said Eleanor Smeal,

<TEXT>
   From the jeweled party dresses of peasants to Peter
the Great's homemade boots, historical fashions from imperial
Russia are being shown in an exhibition from Leningrad's Hermitage
Museum put on by Yves Saint Laurent.
   Until May 31, Parisians will be able to view 200 costumes, 46
paintings and nine engravings covering Russia's prerevolutionary
period from 1700 to 1914. The Jacquemart-Andre Museum, formerly a
dingy mansion, has been refurbished to shine as splendidly as the
czar's Winter Palace.
   Saint Laurent, who was honored with his own fashion
retrospective in the Soviet Union two years ago, was also
celebrating the 225th anniversary of the Hermitage Museum.
   ``This is a great example of glasnost,'' said Stephen de Pietri,
the American curator of the show, referring to the ``openness''
policy of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Several years ago we wouldn't have been able to get seven
court dresses as we did this time,'' he said. ``The Russians are
justifiably proud of these well-preserved costumes. They have done
a fabulous job of preserving their heritage.''
   A small room devoted to Peter I, who made St. Petersburg (now
Leningrad) into an 18th-century imperial city, displays several
outfits that clothed the 6-foot-9 czar, a giant with sloped
shoulders.
   He might have worn the splendid red and blue cavalry dress
outfit during the battle of Poltava as he beat a path to water,
opening up land-locked St. Petersburg to the sea. Standing alone,
Peter's plain homemade boots bear witness to his do-it-yourself
creativity as a young man who built boats as well as boots to
escape boredom before he came to power.
   Among the imperial costumes of Catherine 1, who plotted and
succeeded in marrying Peter the Great, were two outfits for
reviewing the troops. One was green, for the Preobrajenski order,
named after a hero, another red and blue equestrian outfit for
passing the cavalry in review.
   Unlike her towering husband, Catherine, who was empress only two
years (1725-27), was short and fat, wearing a big cloak to cover up
most of her girth.
   The Russian love of Oriental opulence is woven throughout the
show, with silver and gold threads, amazing brocade embroidery,
iridescent taffetas, jet beads, sequins and pearls. Red velvet,
always a Russian favorite, is shown generously throughout. But the
enormous rubies, emeralds and amethysts the Russian royals lavished
on themselves have now been replaced by glass stones.
   Only in the Soviet Union could one find the exquisite antique
shawls on view, woven so finely in stained-glass colors that the
threads are barely perceptible. The price was heavy for the young
girls who wove the fabrics, who often went blind.
   Yet the French fashion influence is obvious as well.
   ``Peter the Great decreed that European styles would be worn at
court,'' said Isabelle de Courreges, a spokeswoman for Saint
Laurent. ``Everything about dressing was decreed, even the length
of the trains.''
   Many of the 19th-century outfits are nearly line-for-line copies
of what Parisians were wearing, from high-waisted French empire
styles to crinoline skirts and bustles. One tableau of ``The
Imperial White Nights'' is a stunning succession of gossamer-light
silvery embroidered dresses.
   Going along with the modern dawn-to-dark philosophy, are two
convertible dresses with separate tops, circa 1880. The daytime
versions sport frothy jabots for modesty at the the neck, while the
evening tops have daring decolletages.
   The show's mannequins are given an amazingly lifelike appearance
with period curls and coifs fashioned out of stiffened ``silk
paper,'' the work of two Parisian hair stylists.
   While women might envy the extraordinary beauty of the elaborate
dresses, men could covet some of the marvelous silk dressing gowns
worn in off-hours.
   Outfits from the top Russian couturiers Lamanova, Brissac and
Boulbenkova are displayed alongside models by Poiret and Worth,
favorite Paris designers at the turn of the century.
   Children are not forgotten in the show. A lavish
silver-embroidered salmon pink velvet suit was a gift of Catherine
to her adored grandchild, Alexander I.
   Touching outfits for children that might have been worn by
Anastasia and Alexis _ offspring of the last Czar Nicholas II _ are
just as elaborate as the grown-ups' clothes: a short silvery dress
for the little girl, an embroidered blue velvet suit for a boy.
   A group of peasant ``fete'' dresses topped by cockscomb
``kokoschnik'' (halo-headdresses) is just as rich-looking as the
court styles, though with informal touches such as gay sashes and
suspenders with lace-trimmed ``sarafan'' or apron dresses.
   The glittery folklore was reminiscent of the ``rich and happy
peasant'' styles admired by Saint Laurent, and the inspiration for
his 1976 Ballets Russes collection.

   Forecasters gazing into their crystal balls say
the economic picture is still fuzzy but they have started to get an
image of how people are reacting to rising interest rates. A few
businesses probably don't like what they've seen so far.
   Car makers and big retail merchants furnished figures this past
week that cast shadows of doubt about their situations.
   Sales of cars and trucks in the United States skidded an
unexpectedly steep 18.3 percent in late March, auto manufacturers
reported, and many retailers didn't ring up as much business last
month as they had thought they would.
   The news was unsurprising given the direction interest rates
have taken lately.
   Expensive purchases normally financed with loans _ like cars _
were predicted to shrink as consumers became obliged to spend more
on things such as mortgage payments. So widely anticipated was the
spending slowdown that the nation's Big Three automakers cranked up
their promotional vehicles before the latest results were even in.
   They have been touting rebates and cut-rate financing deals,
including Chrysler Corp.'s zero percent financing, to tempt
customers back into the showrooms during the important spring
car-buying season.
   Historically, March and April are the months when shoppers gear
up for extra summertime driving by paying a visit to dealerships.
Many may have stopped by to browse in late March but fewer than
usual bought.
   Conventional wisdom says the incentives will breathe some oomph
into auto sales, but after a short while they'll lose gusto again
once bargain-hunters have had their fill.
   When many of nation's major retailers toted up March sales they
were disappointed. Some blamed bad weather or the fact that they
had one less selling day in this year's five-week period than they
had last year _ which can make a big difference.
   Retail industry analysts agreed with those points. But in
sifting through the numbers they came up with evidence that
consumers are losing enthusiasm to spend money on the types of
things they bought in abundance during much of the six-year
economic expansion.
   ``I think we have a fundamental switch in consumer spending,''
says Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co.
   Consumers are spending more on services, such as travel,
recreational pastimes or personal health and fitness plans.
   ``The kind of items bought at the chain stores are less
prominent in the consumer basket these days,'' according to Sinai.
   A calculation by the securities firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
indicated sales of specialty apparel, hard goods such as home
furnishings, and other general merchandise, rose just 4.6 percent
in March, down from February's 7.6 percent growth. In order words,
sales barely kept ahead of inflation.
   Retailers are justifiably reluctant to generalize based on only
one month's performance. The transition from winter to summer can
be an unsettled time for the weather, so shoppers frequently don't
buy clothes to freshen up their wardrobes or get new gardening
gear, for instance, until they're sure warm temperatures have come
to stay.
   April could be a cruel month for car makers and general
merchandisers if customers don't act on the traditional weather cue
and go out shopping.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The government reported what was desribed as an ambiguous set
of statistics about the labor market. The Labor Department said the
unemployment rate fell to 5 percent in March, a new 15-year low,
from 5.1 percent the month before, even though the number of new
jobs added to the economy fell to the smallest amount since August.
   _Eastern Airlines agreed to be acquired by an investor group led
by former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth for about $464
million. But the deal, which would give Eastern's 30,000 employees
a 30 percent stake in the airline, won't become final until after
parent Texas Air Corp. brings Eastern out of federal bankruptcy
protection, among other things.
   _As junk bond enthusiasts capped an annual get-together in
California and toasted Michael Milken's pioneering efforts in the
high-yield, high-risk business, the former head of Drexel Burnham's
junk bond operation pleaded innocent at his arraignment in
Manhattan federal court on a raft of racketeering and securities
fraud charges.

<HEAD>Another Inflation Test Awaits Wall Street</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a stock market intensely focused on economic
statistics, ``producer prices'' are the magic words for the coming
week on Wall Street.
   The government is due to report Wednesday on the March producer
price index for finished goods.
   Stock and bond traders will be watching closely to see whether
the index, a measure of inflationary pressures at the next-to-last
point in the distribution chain, shows signs of letting up.
   Increases of 1 percent in the index for both January and
February shook up the markets when they were reported, and fanned
fears of increasing inflation and higher interest rates.
   ``The index is the most worrisome inflation indicator at this
time,'' the Merrill Lynch Market Letter observed. ``Another large
increase could prompt further credit-tightening moves by the
Federal Reserve.''
   If advance estimates by private economists are right, a measure
of relief is on the way.
   The consensus view is that the increase for March will be down
to about half a percentage point _ still a bit high, perhaps, but
at least moving in the right direction.
   Peter Greenbaum at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., which is
looking for a gain of either 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent, says the
expected improvement lies mainly in food and energy prices, which
were primary culprits in the increases of the two previous months.
   The adverse price effects of the oil spill near Valdez, Alaska,
won't show up in producer prices until the April figures are out,
he said.
   Of course, there are no guarantees against an unpleasant
surprise. The February figure came in well above expectations.
   But whatever the ups and downs of the figures over the next
month or two, many economists argue that inflation is likely to
subside significantly as the year passes.
   ``We think the stage is being set for a deceleration of
inflation later in 1989,'' said Jeffrey Applegate at Tucker,
Anthony &amp; R.L. Day Inc.
   ``The recent inflation figures, while certainly worse than
expectations, are also history. They lag, not lead.''
   Applegate points out that such traditional early-warning
indicators of inflation as the price of gold and the growth rate of
the money supply are sounding no alarms at all.
   He also observed that the stock market has risen, on balance,
since the Fed began to tighten credit a year ago, suggesting at
least a cautious belief that the central bank might succeed in
restraining inflation without inflicting severe pain on the economy.
   In the past week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
11.18 points to 2,304.80.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.40 to
166.93; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 3.98 to 410.71, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 2.28 at 330.59.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 166.93 million shares a day,
against 146.91 million the week before.
   Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities, says
he believes the rise of 3 percentage points in short-term interest
rates over the past year is ``starting to bite. But we don't expect
a recession.
   ``Rather, we believe that the Fed's aggressive preemptive attack
against inflation is working.
   ``While consensus expectations are like to continue to bounce
between the extremes of boom and bust, we expect that the economy
will continue to chug along somewhere down the middle.''

<HEAD>Giant Hydroelectric Plant Will Be Towed Up The Mississippi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The vessel is anything but traditional but a
ceremony Saturday will employ the standard champagne bottle
christening for the world's first pre-fabricated hydroelectric
plant.
   ``We're inflicting a little bit of shipyard tradition on it,''
said Bruce Wismar, the man who oversaw construction of the 12-story
structure at Avondale Industries. ``After all, it will be making a
heck of a trip.''
   Three tugs will push the 456-foot long Merrimac, which resembles
a 12-story grey box, 208 miles up the Mississippi River in late
April or early May, depending on river conditions, Wismar said.
   The structure _ actually a power plant enclosed in a dam _ is so
massive it will have to be partially sunk near Baton Rouge to allow
it to pass under a bridge, but Wisner said no trouble was expected
during the four- to five-day journey.
   ``We will ballast it down to get under the bridge, probably by
about 50-feet or five stories... We have installed a temporary
ballast system and 24 pumps to pump the water back out when we're
past the bridge,'' Wismar said.
   A 106-foot deep hole has been prepared at the flooded site of
the new plant between the Mississippi and Red Rivers about 40 miles
below Vidalia. Once the plant is floated onto the site, a levee
will be rebuilt, the water drained off and the plant permanently
grounded.
   The eight-turbine power plant is expected to begin generating
electricity by 1990.
   The brainchild of former Vidalia mayor, Sidney Murray Jr., the
plant is intended to produce cheap electricity for the 6,800
Vidalia residents and help generate jobs and prosperity for the
town, which has been hit hard by depressed oil and farming
industries.
   ``When we started all of this we had 22 percent unemployment in
our area,'' Murray said Thursday.
   ``What I really wanted to do back them was just try to stabilize
energy prices,'' he said. ``...I think we can do that when the
plant gets going and I think it will attract some industry to our
area.''
   Skyrocketing oil prices in past years sent rates for electricity
from local oil-fired power plants soaring. Rates never receded when
oil prices did and expectations were that if oil prices rose
strongly again in coming years the electric rates again would
follow suit.
   The plant will produce enough electricity for over 200,000
homes. Vidalia is entitled to between 6 percent and 15 percent of
the electricy, enough to supply its residents.
   When the debt for building the $500 million facility is paid off
in 41 years through plant revenue, Vidalia will begin receiving a
third of the money from the sale of power and can set local
electric rates.
   The other two partners are Catalyst Energy Development
Corporation of New York and Dominion Capital Inc. of Virginia.
   Catalyst is a wholly owned subsidiary of Merrimac Inc., a
privately-held corporation principally owned by Tom B. Pickens III,
son of the noted corporate raider T. Boone Pickens. Merrimac and
its related companies have 18 operating facilities in 13 states and
10 more projects under construction.
   Local officials expect the population of Vidalia to double in
coming years as more businesses move to a 280-acre industrial park
aimed at capitalizing on the new source of power.
   City officials and a lot of what Murray called ``regular
residents'' planned to journey to New Orleans for Saturday's
ceremonies, he said.
   ``It's been 13 years, and I think they want to actually see it
so they'll really believe it's going to happen now,'' Murray said.

<HEAD>Despite Ueberroth Deal, Eastern's Future Up in the Air</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter V. Ueberroth's $464 million deal to buy
Eastern Airlines and share ownership with its unions is a major
step toward untangling the strikebound carrier's problems.
   But can Ueberroth and his team _ or another potential suitor who
might emerge _ resurrect Eastern as a competitive airline?
   Once any buyer gets the company back into operation, Eastern's
new managers will have to repair its battered service reputation,
regain customers who deserted the virtually grounded airline and
compete head-on with such aggressive rivals as Delta Air Lines and
American Airlines that already have muscled further into Eastern
turf.
   Cheaper fares _ at least for the first few weeks Eastern is back
into the air _ are a strong possibility to lure back passengers,
observers believe.
   Eastern ``is moving off dead-center,'' said Robert Joedicke, an
airline analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``Whether it will
fly or not, I don't think anybody can tell this early.''
   The arrival of the buyout group led by former baseball
commissioner Ueberroth has galvanized Eastern's embittered
employees and lifted their rock-bottom morale. Picketing pilots and
flight attendants at airports up and down the East Coast cheered
news of the sale Thursday while Machinists sang ``Take Me Out to
the Ballgame'' at a packed union hall in Miami, Eastern's home base.
   But beyond the euphoria, Ueberroth admitted there are two major
hurdles his group must vault before Eastern can again fly a full
schedule: approval of new work agreements with Eastern's unions and
approval of the buyout by Eastern creditors and the U.S. bankruptcy
court.
   Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection and reorganization on
March 9, five days after the start of a Machinists union strike
that won the support of pilots and flight attendants, virtually
grounded the carrier and drained its cash reserves.
   ``There are no miracle workers standing in front of you,''
Ueberroth said in announcing the deal with Texas Air Corp.
   Under the proposed buyout, Eastern employees would get a 30
percent stake in the carrier in exchange for some $210 million in
pay cuts and work-rule concessions. The Ueberroth group almost
immediately began talks with the unions to beat a midnight Tuesday
deadline set in the deal for reaching agreements.
   The airline's attempt to wring $125 million in concessions from
its Machinists _ who in turn demanded a pay raise _ had
precipitated the strike. If Ueberroth succeeds in wresting
concessions from the unions that Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo
was unable to get, and if the court and creditors approve, his real
challenge will still lie ahead.
   American Airlines, for example, has been quick to capitalize on
Eastern's troubles. The Dallas-based carrier announced Thursday
that it plans to add 11 flights in Miami and 13 in the Caribbean _
traditionally a stronghold of Eastern.
   The new schedule gives American nine new flights a day out of
Miami and seven new flights daily out of San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Officials of American said the Machinists strike against Eastern
accelerated their expansion plans.
   Competitors have been moving in on Eastern long before the
strike began. In the past five years its leading rivals _ Delta,
American, Pan Am, Trans World Airlines and USAir Group _ together
have added some 1,600 new flights in Eastern markets east of the
Mississippi.
   Some rivals have raised fares on competitive routes since the
Eastern walkout began. Archrival Delta, based in Atlanta, says it
hasn't raised fares but has tightened fare restrictions as a result
of Eastern's paralysis.
   ``A lot of things have to be changed'' at Eastern, said Julius
Maldutis, who follows the industry for Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Maldutis is one of a number of experts who expect the airline to
offer special discount fares to attract customers once it gets off
the ground. Other carriers, such as United Airlines, Braniff Inc.
and Eastern's sister Continental Airlines, have sharply cut fares
following strikes.
   The fare cuts are bound to be temporary and unlikely to be
matched by Eastern's competitors, analysts believe.
   ``Initially, there will be some incentive of that type (cheap
fares) put in ... just to get people back to Eastern,'' said Louis
Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia.
   After that, he warns, ``It's going to be a slow, steady process
of winning their customers back and keeping costs down ... They're
still going to be losing money hand over fist at the beginning.''
   With improved marketing strategy and service, a revived Eastern
might start to break even by year's end, Marckesano suggested.
   The airline has lost $1.5 billion over the past decade and has
piled up debts totaling $3.2 billion.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said Friday that the sale to Ueberroth,
if approved, would have a ``positive effect'' on the credit
positions of Texas Air and Eastern.
   However, the credit-rating agency cautioned, ``Eastern has lost
market share to competitors and will be even more dependent on
price-sensitive leisure traffic without its shuttle,'' which it has
agreed to sell to developer Donald Trump for $365 million.
   ``Eastern has a relatively old fleet and high non-labor fixed
costs. The airline will be vulnerable to competition and would be
hurt badly by a recession,'' S&amp;P stated.

<HEAD>American Software Companies Sue Italian Firms For Copyright Infringement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. software consortium has accused
three Italian firms of pirating American programs in an
unprecedented copyright infringement suit, company officials said
Friday.
   The suit, filed Thursday in Milan by the Business Software
Association, accuses the European companies of copying without
authorization software produced by Lotus Development Corp. of
Cambridge and Ashton-Tate Corp. of Torrance, Calif.
   The Elettrocarbonium SpA, Montedison SpA and its affiliate,
Monefibre SpA, were named as co-defendants in BSA's suit, but
exactly what if any compensation the group was seeking was not
specified.
   BSA President Douglas E. Phillips said the group would likely
file additional lawsuits against several other companies in the
months to come.
   ``The level of unauthorized copying of software in Italy _ not
only by dealers but by organizational users _ is one of the most
egregious in Europe,'' Phillips said in a prepared statement.
   The breach had cost companies trying to develop and market
legitimate software hundreds of millions of dollars, Phillips said.
   Technical experts found evidence of widespread software
duplication during inspections ordered by the Italian courts and
conducted last week at two of the accused firms, Phillips said.
   He said more than 90 percent of the software inspected at
Montedison was reproduced without authorization and 80 percent of
the software inspected at Elettrocarbonium consisted of
unauthorized copies.
   Officials at the Milan-based Montedison and its affiliate have
denied the charges. BSA officials did not know whether
Elettrocarbonium had also denied the allegations.
   BSA spokeswoman Pilar Cloud said the accused companies pirate
the software by buying a single copy of a program and then
duplicating it internally and reselling it.
   ``It's a fairly common practice internationally, but it's very
illegal,'' Cloud said. ``BSA hopes to put a stop to it.''
   Washington-based BSA was founded in 1988 to promote free and
open trade in legitimate business software while protecting
intellectual property.
   The consortium's membership also includes Aldus Corp. of
Seattle, Autodesk Inc. of Sausalito, Calif., Microsoft Corp. of
Redmond, Wash., and WordPerfect Corp. of Orem, Utah.

<HEAD>Junk Bond Whiz Michael Milken, Brother Plead Innocent</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond
chief Michael Milken and his brother have pleaded innocent to a
massive racketeering and securities fraud indictment but their
lawyers will be back in court next week to settle on bail.
   Looking tan and smiling, Milken, 42, dressed in a navy blue,
pinstriped suit entered his plea Friday before a standing-room-only
crowd at federal court in Manhattan.
   Outside the courthouse later, dozens of applauding supporters,
some wearing hats that read ``Mike Milken We Believe in You,''
cheered him and shook his hand as he left without comment.
   ``Mr. Milken looks forward to the opportunity to have his story
come out in court where you have due process and the truth will
emerge,'' said one of Michael Milken's lawyers, Arthur L. Liman.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder denied reports that prosecutors
asked it to bar employees from holding a courthouse rally for
Milken. But the firm issued a statement sympathetic to Milken
supporters.
   ``Some individuals have chosen to express their support for Mike
at this very difficult and emotional time for him,'' Drexel said.
`We understand their desire to express their feelings.''
   Supporters also rallied for Milken at Drexel's annual high-yield
bond conference being held this week in Beverly Hills, Calif. where
the Drexel high yield bond department is headquartered.
   Also pleading innocent before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood at
federal court in Manhattan was Milken's brother, Lowell, 40. A
third defendant, former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg was absent
due to a skiing accident and will be arraigned April 25.
   All three were named in a 98-count federal securities fraud and
racketeering indictment handed up by a grand jury March 29.
   Both Milkens were released without bail after Assistant U.S.
Attorney John Carroll said prosecutors and defense lawyers ``made
substantial progress'' during talks to reach an acceptable bond for
the defendants and their assets.
   The racketeering charges seek $1.85 billion in forfeitures from
each of the three defendants, which amounts to their total combined
earnings at Drexel from 1984 to 1987. The government reportedly had
asked the three defendants to post a $1 billion bond to avoid
pretrial restraints on their assets.
   Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act,
assets found by the jury to be the result of racketeering
activities are subject to forfeiture proceedings and prosecutors
could ask the judge to freeze the Milkens' assets to guarantee
their availability in the event of a conviction.
   Ms. Wood scheduled another court session for Tuesday morning, at
Carroll's request, to finalize bond arrangements.
   Lowell Milken, dressed in a gray suit, said, ``I plead not
guilty'' in a loud firm voice when asked by the judge.
   In addition to the potential $1.85 billion in forfeiture, all
three defendants face possible maximum fines of $3.7 billion each
if convicted on either of two racketeering charges.
   Prosecutors, however, concede that upon conviction, a judge is
unlikely to impose maximum fines or maximum prison sentences, which
would be 520 years in Michael Milken's case.
   Milken, took a leave of absence from his job as head of the junk
bond division, where he reportedly made more than $1 billion over
four years, including $550 million in 1987.
   The racketeering indictment followed a more than two-year
investigation of Wall Street's fifth-largest investment firm that
was triggered by information supplied by convicted stock speculator
Ivan Boesky.
   Drexel in December agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and
pay a record $650 million to settle securities fraud charges with
the U.S. attorney's office.
   The plea deal is conditional on settlement of separate civil
insider trading charges filed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission against Drexel. Sources familiar with the negotiations
said the agreement could be completed next week.
   Milken, though, is challenging the criminal deal on the grounds
that is violates his rights by forcing Drexel to fire him and
withhold his 1988 pay of more than $100 million.
