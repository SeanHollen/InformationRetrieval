   Moslem guerrillas fired a rocket into a
crowded Kabul neighborhood Wednesday that killed seven people and
wounded 21, state television reported.
   The television said it landed near a line of people waiting for a
bus near the Mikrorayon district, where senior government officials
live. The victims included people waiting at a distribution center
for scarce flour and cooking oil, witnesses said.
   Guerrillas surround Kabul and attack supply convoys, creating
severe food and fuel shortages, but have fired few rockets into the
city as the Feb. 15 deadline nears for withdrawal of all Soviet
military forces. This was the first reported in several days.
   Soviet military transports fly in hundreds of tons of flour daily
to help feed the poor in a city packed with 2 million residents and
refugees, but a Soviet officer said the flights would end with the
withdrawal.
   A U.N. airlift of food and medicine from Pakistan to Kabul had
been expected to start Tuesday, but has been delayed at least until
Thursday.
   Col. Pavel Vinokunovsaid 35 Soviet air force planes, most of them
giant Ilyushin 76 transports, have brought 600 tons of flour to the
capital every day. Vinokunov, who has spent 2{ years in Afghanistan,
commands the Red Army soldiers who guard the airport and protect the
aircraft.
   He said the airlift would contine until Monday, two days before
the deadline, when he and his men will leave the defense of the
airport to Afghan forces and return to the Soviet Union.
   Vinokunov would not reveal how many men he commanded, but said:
``We have enogh to fulfill the task, to do the job and then some.''
   Soviet diplomats said privately fewer than 500 Soviet soldiers
remined in Kabul.
   In Moscow, the official news agency Tass quoted Col. Gen. Mikhail
Moiseyev, military chief of staff, as Wednesday the last Soviet
soldier would leave Afghanistan on Feb. 14.
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said Gen. B. V. Gromov, the
Red Army commander in Afghanistan, would be the last to leave, at
precisely 10 a.m. Feb. 15, the deadline.
   It said he would march across the border bridge at Termez and
make a silent speech to himself for precisely 1 minute and 7
seconds. It did not say whether those were Gromov's plans or its own
speculation.
   The Kremlin sent military forces to Afghanistan in December 1979
to help combat Moslem guerrillas who began fighting after a
Communist coup in April 1978. An estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers
were in the country when the pullout began May 15 under a
U.N.-mediated agreement.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, U.N. officials said the crew of a
chartered EgyptAir transport had refused to make the first flight of
the U.N. airlift to Kabul with 32 tons of supplies and Ethiopian
Airlines had agreed to do it.
   Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, who directs the $1.1 billion U.N.
relief and reconstruction program for Afghanistan, said the United
Nations ``does not share the apprehension'' of the airline about the
safety of Kabul's airport ``and is convinced of the urgent needs to
be met on the bases of a humanitarian consensus among all those
concerned.''
   In Cairo, the official Middle East News Agency quoted Hassan
Afifi, operations director of EgyptAir, as saying flights to Kabul
``have been postponed, not canceled, until security conditions there
stabilize.'' There was no elaboration.
   Rene Albeck, spokesman for the relief program, said the chartered
Ethiopian plane would fly from Quetta, in arid Baluchistan province
about 65 miles from the Afghan border in southwestern Pakistan. He
said large U.N. storage depots were located there and at Peshawar in
northwestern Pakistan and the two cities would be the hubs for aid
delivery.
   An estimated 350,000 people living in Kabul shantytowns are short
of food and heating fuel in one of the harshest winters of recent
years.
   Long lines form daily for bread. The city needs 650 tons of flour
a day and officials estimate the reserve is enough for only one to
three months.
   The Soviet Union airlifted 3,100 tons of flour to the city last
month and has said another 12,000 tons would be brought in by Feb.
15.
   Vinokunov said the halfway point was reached Wednesday.
   As he spoke with foreign journalists, huge Ilyushin jets took off
and climbed steeply over the mountains that surround Kabul, spitting
out dozens of flares to deflect the heat-seeking missiles often
fired by guerrillas.
   Helicopter gunships, also spouting flares, circled in a two-mile
radius from the runway in search of guerrilla hideouts in the
mountains.
   Until this week the transports carried equipment, soldiers and
Soviet civilians home, the colonel said, but now they return to the
Soviet Union empty.

   The 20-year-old jetliner that crashed in the
Azores on Wednesday had not been subjected to a high number of
takeoff and landings but had several problems requiring repairs in
recent years, officials said.
   The craft was one of two Boeing 707s owned by Independent Air
Corp. of Smyrna, said A.L. Pittman, Independent president. It had
12,500 cycles, or takeoffs and landings, and less than 50,000 hours
in the air.
   Jack Barker, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Atlanta, agreed that the figures cited by Pittman were not excessive.
   ``If properly maintained, there should not be a problem because
of hours or number of cycles. Other aircraft involved in the news
have had as much as 50,000 cycles, a great many more.''
   Asked Wednesday night about the plane's repair record, Barker
said he had not seen the service difficulty reports filed with the
FAA, but that the faults found would not be considered a problem,
``not if they've been repaired.''
   ``The important thing is that they're fixed properly,'' he said.
   The charter plane crashed on approach to Santa Maria Airport in
the Azores, killing the 137 Italian tourists who were passengers and
an American crew of seven. The flight was headed from Bergamo,
Italy, to the Dominican Republic, and would have continued without
passengers to Jamaica.
   In the Azores, an island chain west of Portugal, airport
dispatcher Gualder Cordero said there were no radio messages or
warnings before the plane went down.
   Pittman said one of the company's two jets lost oil pressure Jan.
21 as it flew into Denver and required repairs before resuming eight
to 10 hours later. He did not know if the same jet crashed
Wednesday, and said of the oil problem, ``Don't look for anything in
that.''
   Barker said Independent Air Corp. was fined $18,000 in 1984, but
he could offer no further information about that FAA enforcement
action before Thursday.
   Records at the FAA's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in
Oklahoma City show seven service difficulty reports on the plane
over the past six years, spokeswoman Bobbie Mardis said.
   They included two reports in January 1983: an engine shutdown due
to turbine failure and failure of a switch in the main landing gear.
   Filings in July 1987 showed problems occurred with an electrical
transformer powering a lavatory heater, altimeter and air-speed
monitor problems caused a return to Atlanta for replacement of a
static line, a left inboard keel beam extension fitting was found
cracked on the fuselage, and the right fitting was found broken.
   The seventh report, filed in December, indicated that during
inspection, a mechanic noticed a crack in the No. 2 engine first
stage fan duct. Further inspection revealed a {-inch crack, the
report said, adding that the duct was replaced and the plane was
returned to service.
   ``I'm not aware (of the service difficulty reports) so I'd have
to say they are fairly minor,'' Independent co-owner Orien Dickerson
said. ``We have the same stringent monitoring program as Delta,
American and all the major airlines. Every time you go into a major
maintenance check you'll find some amount of corrosion.''
   Pittman identified six of the victims as: Leon Daugherty, 41, of
Nashville, the captain; Sammy Adcock, 36, Nashville, first officer;
Jorge Gonzalez, 34, Rex, Ga., the flight enginner; and flight
attendants Yvette Murray, 26, of Marietta, Ga., Angela Urban, 24,
West Palm Beach, Fla., Helen Ziegler, 45, Warner Robins, Ga., and
Sabrina Cromarty, whose age and hometown he did not know.
   The remaining flight attendant, a woman, was not identified
pending notification of relatives.
   Independent Air has 100 employees, 65 of whom are crew members,
Pittman said.
   ``Generally everybody knows everybody else in a company this
size,'' he said. ``It's like losing a member of your family. We are
deeply saddened. There have been some tears here today in shock.''
   The Boeing 707-320B, which could seat 186 passengers, was 152
feet, 11 inches long with a wingspan of 145 feet, 9 inches. The
aircraft was first introduced by Boeing in 1961.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Warns Philippines On Deals With Marcos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Justice Department said it
would not help prosecute Ferdinand Marcos and would seize his
property if Manila agrees to an unacceptable deal for his return
home, it was reported Wednesday.
   Teodoro Locsin Jr., publisher of the Philippine Daily Globe and
President Corazon Aquino's speechwriter, said the warning was
relayed to Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Presidential Commission on
Good Government.
   ``The U.S. Attorney General has made it clear: `Total discretion
cuts both ways. If Philippine officials have total discretion to
undo years of American efforts to secure justice for the Filipino
people, U.S. officials have equally total discretion to make
Filipinos pay for tolerating such officials,''' Locsin said.
   Caparas arrived in the United States last week, supposedly to
determine whether the ousted president is prepared to negotiate in
order to come home from exile in Hawaii.
   The Philippine government says Marcos and his associates
embezzled up to $10 billion. President Corazon Aquino has said the
government will not discuss his return until he gives back the money.
   Caparas' trip to the United States, confirmed Wednesday by Mrs.
Aquino, raised speculation that the Aquino administration was
prepared to negotiate a deal. Aquino said Caparas was only to meet
with Marcos representatives but not negotiate.
   U.S. officials said a hasty settlement of Philippine charges by
Manila could undermine American efforts to prosecute Marcos.
   ``The justice officials from the U.S. Attorney General's office
insisted that whatever terms and conditions Caparas negotiates, a
plea of guilty by either Marcos or his wife should be
non-negotiable,'' Locsin wrote.
   Locsin quoted Caparas as saying U.S. officials threatened to
withhold evidence of Marcos' alleged secret bank accounts received
from the Swiss government.
   They also warned that the U.S. attorney general could take
possession of Marcos' properties in New York, which the Philippine
government hopes to sell, and ``dispose of them as he deems fit,''
Locsin added.
   The properties are estimated to be worth $300 million.
   Marcos and his wife Imelda have lived in Hawaii since a 1986
popular uprising toppled his 20-year administration. Marcos has been
hospitalized since Jan. 15 with heart and lung ailments and has
asked to return to die in his homeland.
   Last October, the Marcoses were indicted on U.S. federal
racketeering charges alleging they stole more than $100 million and
stashed much of the money in American banks.
   Locsin said U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella of New York told
Caparas that U.S. officials could also agree to a plea-bargain that
would be unfavorable to Manila.
   ``In seven days ... the U.S. cases could be dropped and all U.S.
legal constraints on Marcos' return to Manila would evaporate,''
Locsin said. ``The Philippines would then have no leverage to deal
with Marcos, either to secure a financial restitution or even a
promise of good behavior from him.''
   Efforts to contact Caparas in New York were unsuccessful because
he refused to return calls from The Associated Press.
   In another development, an ex-Cabinet minister said he deposited
into a Swiss bank account more than $4.5 million in kickbacks from
Japanese companies for Marcos, according to court documents obtained
Tuesday.
   The seven Japanese companies he named all denied the allegation.
   Baltazar Aquino, Marcos' former public works and highways
minister, made the allegation in four statements submitted Friday
during deposition hearings in connection with 39 civil suits against
the former president.

   Iran's leaders are trying to woo tens of
thousands of skilled exiles home to help with the massive task of
postwar reconstruction. But few emigres seem ready to risk it.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered the most
powerful figure in Iran after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and
others are moving to encourage political and social liberalization,
in part to entice educated Iranians home.
   Rafsanjani declared at a recent Tehran rally: ``If we give up
some of the short-sightedness, ... some of the crude aspects which
were the requirements of the early stages of the revolution, and
which we do not need today, we will attract them back.''
   At least 2 million Iranians, including scientists, technocrats,
managers and academics, fled after Khomeini's 1979 Islamic
revolution toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and during the 8-year
war against Iraq.
   They included many young men dodging military service who were
often smuggled out of the country illegally, monarchists, leftists
and disaffected middle class businessmen.
   Unofficial estimates indicate that only about one-fifth of
Iranians sent abroad to complete their studies have returned home.
   Iran badly needs technical expertise for reconstruction.
   Few of the exiles, ranging from former government and
revolutionary leaders to shopkeepers and students, contacted in
several countries by The Associated Press showed any desire to
return to Iran now.
   _Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, the Islamic republic's first president who
fled to France in 1981 amid a bloody purge of liberals and leftists,
said: ``I don't think these appeals will have any result. These days
there are executions ... by the hundreds and all the reactions to
the appeals has been negative.''
   _Shahpour Bakhtiar, the last Iranian prime minister under the
shah who is also living in France, said: ``No exile in a financial
position to return would do so the way things are at present.
   ``Security is more precarious, the law less respected, than at
any time since the shah's days. ... The way the leaders of the
country treat internal opposition does not inspire trust.
   ``As long as the government _ and I don't think there is one _ is
not able to respect the rights of people, I don't think that anyone
who has a certain value, a certain effectiveness ... will have a
desire to return.''
   _Mohammad Vavood, a spokesman for the opposition Mujahedeen
Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, in Cologne, West Germany, said:
``I know of no one who's planning to return. It would be suicide to
go back to Iran now.''
   _Abol Ghassem Kargar, 67, who runs a supermarket in Los Angeles
now after fleeing through Turkey said when reached while back in
Turkey: ``If the mullahs go, I'd go back and so would 80 percent of
the exiles I know.''
   Kargar said he fled Iran in 1983 after Revolutionary Guards
killed his son Sina, along with 130 women and 440 men in a Tehran
prison when they staged a protest demanding better conditions.
   He said his son, a graduate of the University of California at
Los Angeles, was a civil engineering professor at Tehran University
when he was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards for allegedly not
including Islamic teaching in his classes.
   Kargar said the guards later seized two private girls' schools he
owned and ran in Tehran for 20 years, along with the family villa on
the Caspian Sea.
   He was in Istanbul seeking to take his sister, Fatima, 55, to the
United States. His three daughters, who now live with him in
California, had fled Iran via Pakistan and Afghanistan after he got
out.

   British sailors from the frigate
Avenger and a British helicopter towing a huge Grenadian flag took
part in a military parade marking this Caribbean island's 15th
anniversary of independence from Britain.
   Premier H.A. Blaize, Gov. Gen. Sir Paul Scoon and other
dignitaries and opposition leaders took part in the ceremony,
attended by about 2,000 people.
   The tiny eastern Caribbean island, with a population of 100,000
people, became independent from Britain on Feb. 7, 1974.
   It was the scene of a U.S.-led invasion in October 1983 that
ousted a regime of hard-line Marxists, who days before assassinated
leftist Prime Minister Maurice Bishop in a bloody coup.

   The setting is peaceful, on a lake
surrounded by Douglas firs. But peace is far from the minds of the
war veterans who meet here to unload decades of violent and fearful
thoughts and feelings.
   For many, it's the first time since the war that they've felt
free to cry.
   ``Some of these people haven't felt in years,'' said Anne
Gregory, manager of nurses for the post-traumatic stress disorder
program at the Veterans' Hospital at American Lake, herself a
Vietnam veteran.
   ``The fact that some of these people are still sane is
remarkable. PTSD is treatable, but it takes time,'' Gregory said.
   An estimated 470,000 of the 3.14 million vets who served in
Vietnam suffer from PTSD and 80 percent of those never have sought
mental help, said American Lake director Ray Scurfield. His is one
of 14 relatively new programs in this country trying to help PTSD
victims. Three percent of its participants served in Korea and World
War II, the rest in Vietnam.
   In the company of other vets and a professional staff of 23 that
includes 13 veterans, men who never quite left the war behind tell
of sleepless nights, flashbacks, guilt over having killed, guilt
over having survived, uncontrolled anxiety and rage and the
isolation they feel.
   Holding hands, they ride in Huey helicopters in maneuvers similar
to those commonly used in the war. The sound of the rotors and rush
of wind was enough for one to tearfully recall his last flight in a
Huey, a trip that ended in an ambush and the deaths of 18 of the 35
men in his squad.
   Some go on an Outward Bound trip and push their limits in rapids
in search of new perspectives on their abilities and their lives.
   Many vets are hearing for the first time that it's human to feel
what they feel, and that anyone who has experienced severe trauma _
the Holocaust, for example, or even major earthquakes _ can feel the
same way.
   And it's the first time many have let go _ the birth of a long
period of healing, forgiveness, learning to live with memories,
trusting themselves and others, and hoping for the future.
   ``They're digging things out of me here that I didn't even know
were issues,'' said Dan Collins, 42, of Tacoma. ``You look at
somebody and see them blown to hell, and they're not there.
   ``It's a convenient way not to make friends, because I'm afraid
of them dying ... I avoid people ... for that and other reasons.
   ``That's the nice thing about this place. They confront you on it
and you have to face what's going on inside of you.''
   Scurfield said any victim of severe trauma can develop chronic
symptoms that can include intrusive imagery, numbing, helplessness,
fear that leads to rage, fear that leads to grief, anger against
authority and ``the system,'' inability to control emotions and
actions, broken relationships and work histories, depression,
anxiety, hypervigilance and sleeping disorders.
   They sometimes express those symptoms and other times avoid
expression altogether, as they probably did at the time the trauma
took place. This leads to physical and emotional isolation and
confusion over personal responsibility, self-worth, relationships,
work _ even play.
   The 11-week program at American Lake, begun in 1985, has served
350 so far, and has an eight-month waiting list. Applicants must
have served in a war zone, have received some counseling already,
and be drug- and alcohol-free. It costs the Veterans Administration
$107 per day per patient.
   Participants learn about controlling anger, anxiety and stress
and about substance abuse and PTSD. They also examine pre-war
experiences that may have contributed to their war reaction;
war-zone trauma; and their post-war years.
   They even look at the benefits of trauma: intense comradeship,
emotional and spiritual insights, and heightened sensitization to
life's horrors and to political behavior, Scurfield said.
   ``By going back to the wound, you finally realize that you have
to feel the pain, the grief, the loss, before the wound is actually
healed,'' said Leonard Horst, 42, of Sequim. ``You'll always have
the scar, but at least you have acceptance and forgiveness.''
   All are encouraged to attend outpatient counseling for six months
to three years to consolidate gains made while in the program,
Scurfield says. Failure to do that can easily mean backsliding and
renewed isolation.
   Vets listen carefully when Scurfield explains how their anger
probably stems from fear. How they had to go to Vietnam at a time
when they would have been undergoing a lot of change anyway and so
were especially vulnerable. How they're the only ones who can change
the crazy life patterns.
   ``The rage is justified, but you still need to let go of it,''
Scurfield said. ``If how you're going to feel or what you're going
to do is determined by someone else, you're not in control... I'm
not saying don't fight, you must ... not let the symptoms control
you. Open a valve and release some of it without hurting yourself.''
   The understanding and definition of the disorder continues to
evolve. How successful American Lake and PTSD treatment are is
anybody's guess without a better follow-up system and more
coordination among the 14 programs, said Scurfield, a doctor of
social work who did psychiatric work in Vietnam.
   A lot more money and programs are needed, especially in the West,
Scurfield testified before Congress last summer. Special emphasis
should be placed on professional support for veteran self-help
groups in geographically isolated areas, where many choose to live
because of low, fixed incomes.
   Scurfield lays the delayed response in identifying and treating
PTSD _ a disorder professionals now believe has always existed among
trauma victims _ to naive psychology trends, right-wing beliefs that
common knowledge of PTSD would undermine the country's ability to
defend itself, and concerns over the immense potential financial
strain of treatment.
   In a recent survey sent to 180 American Lake graduates and
answered by 85, a majority had been helped in self-esteem,
relationships, and understanding they have the responsibility and
ability to change. But a significant minority reported no real
change in depression and anxiety, relationships and intrusive
symptoms.
   ``I definitely needed another tuneup and more time,'' said
Richard Fairfield, 39, of rural northeast Utah. ``It took me 20
years to get as screwed up as I was... If they had helped me 20
years ago, I wouldn't be here. The program should be longer.''
   Ten percent of participants have returned once, Scurfield said.
   Despite its admitted weaknesses, Steve Petty, a VA social worker
in Loma Linda, Calif., and a member of a congressionally mandated
PTSD committee, says American Lake is considered on the cutting edge
of treatment.
   ``These people know what's going on,'' said Fairfield. ``When I
wake up at 3 a.m. drenched in sweat and have to talk, they're
there.''
   It's the only program with a special support group for children
of Vietnam vets, and it's the only one that incorporates the
helicopter rides.
   ``I was trying to make sense out of nonsense,'' said Jeff
Russell, 36, of Olympia. ``I felt I was the only person who felt
that way.
   ``This program ... gave me a chance to work on issues and stop
from hitting bottom... I have to pick myself up, and live.''

<HEAD>Reopened Just over a Year Ago, Phillipines Congress Hit by Scandals</HEAD>

   Closed down by President Ferdinand E.
Marcos in 1972 and reopened just over a year ago, the Philippines
Congress now is swept up in scandals.
   Hardly had the dust settled on a scandal involving firearms
imports when members of the House of Representatives were facing
charges of trying to corner the export of coconuts to Taiwan.
   The Senate also has come under fire for deciding to use
taxpayers' money to buy 35 foreign luxury cars for each of its 23
members and certain staff.
   Just before the coconut scandal broke in late January, columnist
Neal Cruz of the Daily Globe wrote that the rubber-stamp congressmen
during Marcos' time ``look like saints compared to the members of
(this) Congress.''
   ``First, some gunrunners in the House of Representatives import
hundreds of high-powered automatic firearms for the protection of
congressmen _ and the rest for the lucrative black market,'' he
added. ``Just as the public heaved a collective sigh of relief that
... the senators are not involved in this caper comes the revelation
that all 23 senators have ordered new cars.''
   The coconut scandal exploded Jan. 25 when the chairman of the
Philippine Coconut Authority claimed at least 12 congressmen were
pressuring his organization to grant them exclusive rights to export
4,500 tons of fresh coconut to Taiwan.
   Jose Romero said the congressmen, from four coconut-growing
provinces south of Manila, were insisting that the authority not
only restore a quota system it had recently scrapped but also to
partition the coconut export quota among themselves.
   He said that until last year, his agency awarded the entire quota
to a group of Filipino exporters but decided three months ago to
stop the practice becuse of complaints from other groups. The move
was also in line with the government's policy of deregulation.
   The congressmen, led by Rep. Leonardo Guerrero, claimed they
simply were trying to protect the interests of small coconut farmers
in their provinces from middlemen they claim had monopolized the
export in the past.
   Guerrero, chairman of the House Sub-Committee on Edible Crops,
denied Romero's charges and accused him of receiving bribes from
middlemen.
   The uproar over the firearms scandal is not over, even though the
200-member House cleared two congressmen of wrongdoing in the
importation of more than 600 Israeli-made Uzi and Galil automatic
rifles.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the imports lacked permits
from his department; customs officials said other regulations were
broken.
   Nevertheless, after a closed special session, the House ruled
that the two congressmen who brokered the importation did not commit
any improprieties. The House voted, however, to turn the weapons
over to the military ``in response to public opinion.''
   Reps. Rodrigo Gutang and Renato Unico, both retired military
officers, said the guns were to have been paid for by the
congressmen with their own money. They said the legislators needed
the weapons to defend themselves from rising crime and threats from
communist rebels.
   As the gun controversy raged, someone leaked the Senate's
decision to buy 35 new cars. The public uproar was immediate, with
most comment accusing the senators of callousness in light of
widespread poverty.
   Callers to television and radio programs threatened to stone
senators in their new cars. One woman offered cash rewards to people
who actually did so.
   A few senators dropped the idea following the uproar, but Senate
President Jovito Salonga and other senators insist that public
officials have a right to have official vehicles.
   Other scandals to hit the House involved pork barrel funds and
other allowances.
   Last year, House Speaker Ramon Mitra handed an envelope
containing 20,000 pesos ($1,000) to a member of the congressional
press corps on the eve of the legislature's Christmas recess.
   Some newspapers immediately assailed the move as an attempt to
buy off the press. Mitra said, however, the money was given in lieu
of a ``traditional blowout'' congress gives reporters after passing
the national budget.
   The money was eventually spent by Mitra on a dinner for the
entire press corps.

   About 50 Dutch and Iranian
protesters smashed windows and painted slogans on the Iranian
Embassy in a demonstration against Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
fundamentalist government, police said.
   Hague police spokesman Rob Brons said three demonstrators were
arrested during Tuesday's protest against Iran's alleged executions
of political opponents.
   Several protesters broke into an adjacent office building in an
apparent attempt to get into the embassy, Brons told The Associated

   Protesters painted ``Down with the Islamic Republic of Iran'' and
``Free Political Prisoners'' on the embassy building, he said.
   No damage estimate was immediately available.

<HEAD>Judge Accepts No Contest Plea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. entered a no contest plea
Tuesday on two federal environmental law violations stemming from
the January 1988 diesel fuel spill.
   U.S. District Judge Gustave Diamond accepted the plea after a
six-hour hearing. He set a sentencing hearing for March 6.
   Under federal law, a no contest plea, while not an admission of
guilt, is a conviction.
   ``They'll face the same criminal penalty as a person who is found
guilty,'' said Acting U.S. Attorney Charles Sheehy.
   In Ashland's case, that amounts to a maximum fine that could
include $200,000 for each of the two counts, $25,000 for each day of
the violation and twice the amount of damages to persons and
property.
   A federal grand jury in September indicted Ashland on two
misdemeanor counts of violating the Clean Water Act and Refuse Act.
   Two months later the company filed a brief seeking dismissal of
the charges. Ashland cited false testimony given by Allegheny County
fire and police officials concerning the company's efforts to obtain
permits to erect the tank.
   In late November, two of the top county officials involved were
forced to resign because of their testimony. A third was suspended.
   Sheehy opposed acceptance of the plea during the hearing, saying
it ``lends credence to the view that a double standard of justice
exists.''
   Sheehy also noted in his brief that such pleas have been opposed
by the U.S. Justice Department as a way to skirt moral
responsibility.
   Ashland still faces 18 civil lawsuits as a result of the Jan. 2,
1988, spill at its Floreffe terminal on the Monongahela River. The
sudden collapse of a diesel storage tank sent about 713,000 gallons
of fuel into the river, creating a slick that disrupted water
supplies to thousands of customers in western Pennsylvania, West
Virginia and Ohio.

<DATELINE>TORKHAM, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A guerrilla commander stood at the
border checkpoint on the western end of the legendary Khyber Pass,
grinned and told the visitor from Pakistan: ``Welcome to free
Afghanistan.''
   Scores of men, heavily armed and dressed in everything from
tribal clothing to captured Soviet helmets and battle jackets,
busied themselves with various tasks around the post.
   One commander, a Soviet-made Kalashnikov assault rifle slung over
his shoulder, shouted orders through a bullhorn.
   The commanders said they were trying to set up a rudimentary
administration at Torkham to handle basic government tasks.
Guerrillas were organizing shelters and offices in the
administration block, immigration building and customs.
   ``This place is now under Islamic government,'' commander Nabib
Mohammed said.
   It appeared to be a relaxed government, at least for the moment.
Men at the posts paid little attention to steady streams of
merchants, fellow guerrillas and local residents crossing the border
in both directions.
   A signpost pointed the way to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
about 140 miles to the west.
   Loudspeakers strung along the road blared Moslem services from
the town mosque. The wailing incantations echoed in the barren brown
hills around Torkham.
   Inside administration buildings pocked by gunfire, small groups
of guerrillas drank tea and talked. Torkham changed hands several
times before government forces abandoned the area last month.
   ``There was much fighting, but now this place is ours,'' Mohammed
said.
   Captured field guns, armored personnel carriers and trucks were
parked near the buildings. Green Islamic flags fluttered from army
trucks that roared up the road from time to time, full of fighting
men.
   A partially burned painting of a Soviet soldier and an Afghan
comrade clasping hands in friendship had been used to patch a hole
in a damaged building. Soviet grain sacks were nailed over holes in
the immigration office.
   Guerrillas who captured Torkham had scrawled their names on the
captured walls.
   Littering the roadside were charred remains of government
documents they burned. Books, documents and newspapers in Russian
were scattered among the ashes, a last reminder of the Red Army
soldiers who aided the Soviet-supported regime for nine years.
   Members of the seven main insurgent groups based in Pakistan held
different buildings in the administration complex. Commanders said
they were taking turns with border duties but many of their men were
illiterate, with little idea of bureaucratic routine.
   Large steel shipping containers bearing the names of U.S.,
Japanese and West European shipping companies dotted the customs
compound.
   Torkham was the main entry point for cars, electronic items and
other Western good shipped through Pakistan to landlocked
Afghanistan. Guerrillas said it might be a long time before imports
resumed.
   Abdul Zaher, another commander, said the guerrillas must defeat
the Marxist government before starting to rebuild a nation shattered
by 11 years of civil war.
   Until that victory, he said, ``about the future we say nothing.''

   The general secretary of the
country's largest labor federation was denied a passport to go to
Zimbabwe for a conference dealing with sanctions on South Africa,
the federation says.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, a predominantly black
federation that actively opposes apartheid, said Tuesday that Jay
Naidoo submitted an urgent passport application on Jan. 5 in hopes
of attending this week's conference in Harare.
   Representatives of eight Commonwealth countries are meeting to
discuss ways of intensifying pressure on South Africa's
white-dominated government to dismantle its system of racial
separation.
   The federation said it received no response to Naidoo's
application despite two letters and four telephone calls to the
Department of Home Affairs. The department refuses to disclose
reasons for its decisions on passport and visa applications.

   A Senate panel Tuesday listened to secretly
taped conversations in which the chairman of the Navajo nation told
a real estate broker how to cover up the thousands of dollars the
broker paid him for helping arrange purchase of a ranch by the tribe.
   The broker, Byron T. ``Bud'' Brown, taped the conversations in
cooperation with investigators for the Senate Select Committee on
Indian Affairs and testified with a grant of immunity before the
committee's special investigative unit.
   Brown said he arranged for businessman Tom Tracy to buy the
491,000-acre Big Boquillas ranch in Arizona for $26.2 million from
Tenneco West Co., and then immediately sell it for $33.4 million to
the Navajos. Brown, a real estate broker, also received a $750,000
commission from Tenneco.
   Brown said the $7.2 million profit was shared by Tracy, Brown and
Peter MacDonald, chairman of the Navajo tribe.
   Brown told the panel he paid MacDonald $25,000 to cover a bank
loan and gave him $50,000 in cash and an expensively equipped BMW
automobile as his share of the profits.
   He said MacDonald's reaction to the idea of ``flipping'' the
ranch to the tribe for the higher price, was to smile and say ``I
assume that I will be taken care of.''
   ``I said `certainly,''' Brown told the panel.
   Brown said the dollar amount was not arrived at immediately, but
later MacDonald came to him and said he needed $25,000 to pay on a
bank loan. The money was supplied through Tracy, Brown said.
   MacDonald's loan money request was followed by one for the BMW
which also was supplied through Tracy, Brown said.
   Following sale of the ranch, Brown said he personally paid
MacDonald several $5,000 increments in $100 bills. The payments were
arranged by MacDonald's son, Peter MacDonald Jr. who called Brown
when his father needed money and use the word ``golf balls'' as a
code for money.
   Sale of the ranch raised eyebrows locally and press publicity was
followed by an investigation by the local U.S. attorney, Brown said.
   When the probe began, the senior MacDonald wanted to cover up the
fact that he had received the $25,000 bank loan payment and the BMW,
the real estate broker said.
   In a recording of a conversation made Nov. 22, 1988, the senior
MacDonald told Brown he should say that his son Peter was the
recipient of the $25,000 and the car.
   When Brown talked to the junior MacDonald on Dec. 14, 1988, the
tape has the son saying, ``We're all three of us Three Musketeers
shoulder to shoulder,'' in reference to Brown's question as to
whether he would stick by the story with his father and Brown.
   On Monday, the junior MacDonald, an attorney, told the committee
under immunity that he went along with the scheme ``because I love
my father.''
   The senior MacDonald has not testified and committee staff said
no agreement to grant him immunity has been reached. Furthermore,
his part in the ranch land sale is under investigation by a federal
grand jury and a movement has begun among the Navajos to recall him
as chairman.
   However, a letter was released Tuesday from a Navajo task force
saying, ``Various individuals have implicated and levelled charges
against the Navajo Nation without substantiating their allegations
with facts. Such malicious allegations are attempts to discredit the
integrity of the Navajo Nation, its people, government and
sovereignty.''
   The letter called for representation by the Navajo nation before
the committee for rebuttal.
   The letter said the Navajos understood that the hearings were
primarily to be into alleged misconduct by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs.
   ``While corruption may exist in any government or at any level
within the Navajo Nation, as it may in Washington, D.C., the
Committee's nearly exclusive focus on selected abuses is creating
the public impression that corruption at Navajo is universal,'' the
letter said.
   The hearings began Jan. 30, will continue through this week, and
for several days later this month.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who chairs the special
investigative unit, said arrangements to have members of the Navajo
task force testify in the latter part of the month would be made.

<HEAD>`Lonesome Dove' Ropes Top Spot in Nielsens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Viewers returned to olden days in CBS' ``Lonesome
Dove,'' and so did network ratings thanks to the hot competition
sparked by the critically acclaimed Western miniseries.
   ``Lonesome Dove'' headed off NBC's competition, a sexy
made-for-TV movie, on Sunday and a bunch of high-rated comedies on
Monday, and made NBC worry about losing its 30-week hold on first
place in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   ABC put up ``Ruthless People'' on Sunday and the new ``Columbo''
on Monday.
   Sunday's bonanza of programming drew 86 percent of the viewing
audience to the three networks. Monday's drew 80 percent. The
networks have averaged shares in the high 60s so far this season, as
audiences have defected to cable and videocassettes. ``Lonesome
Dove'' seemed to prove that a big event can still draw viewers to
network television.
   Sunday night's opening installment of the four-part miniseries
was No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings, with a 28.5 rating. Monday's
installment dropped to 23.8, still respectable.
   ``Lonesome Dove'' stars Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones and
Anjelica Huston and is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by
Larry McMurtry. Its opening night out-rated every movie or
miniseries this season. Its average will likely make it one of the
highest-rated miniseries in recent seasons.
   Despite Sunday's performance, CBS couldn't get out of third place
in the ratings.
   NBC had an average, prime-time rating of 16.0; ABC 13.9, and CBS
13.0. Mid-week last week marked the beginning of the important
February sweeps, one of four months when local affiliates' ratings
are measured to determine advertising rates.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions.
   NBC has now won 30 weeks in a row. But Gerald Jaffe, NBC's vice
president for research projects, was worried that the last three
installments of the miniseries would break NBC's streak.
   ``I would say this week is in jeopardy for us,'' Jaffe said.
``Especially with the president pre-empting us on Thursday.''
   The networks will interrupt programming to cover President George
Bush's address to Congress in prime time on Thursday, NBC's best
night for ratings.
   Last Thursday's ``Late Night with David Letterman Anniversary
Special'' on NBC in prime time, ranked 17th. ABC put the ``Barbara
Walters Special'' in the top 10 and ``The American Music Awards'' at
11th.
   Fox Broadcasting Co. had its highest rating yet, an 11.6 for
``America's Most Wanted,'' which ranked 45th among the network
shows. ``Married ... With Children'' had its highest rating ever,
10.9, and ranked 53rd.
   The top-rated shows last week were: ``Lonesome Dove, Part 1,''
CBS; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC; ``A Different World,'' NBC; ``Murder,
She Wrote,'' CBS; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``60
Minutes,'' CBS; ``Barbara Walters Special,'' ABC; ``Golden Girls,''
NBC; and ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC.
   The lowest-rated network shows were: ``48 Hours,'' ``The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour,'' ``The Magical World of Disney,'' ``Tour of
Duty,'' ``HeartBeat,'' ``Dream Breakers,'' ``TV 101,'' ``Murphy's
Law,'' ``A Fine Romance'' and ``Studio 5B.''
   ABC canceled ``Studio 5B'' after two episodes.
   In the news ratings, ``ABC World News Tonight'' topped what
essentially a three-way tie, with an 11.8 rating. The ``CBS Evening
News'' had an 11.6. ``NBC Nightly News'' had 11.5.

<TEXT>
   On the Duke University campus, it's almost _
but not quite _ as big as Blue Devils basketball. Dance superstar
Mikhail Baryshnikov is making his dramatic stage debut playing a
cockroach in an adaptation of Franz Kafka's ``Metamorphosis.''
   The play has been a hot ticket ever since the box office opened
in December. The first two days, 200 to 300 people waited in line
for as long as four hours to buy tickets. Now the three-week run at
the 640-seat Reynolds Industries Theater is sold out.
   ``Basketball is THE major activity down here, but I would tell
you, that from a cultural and artistic standpoint, this has been the
biggest thing to hit the campus in a long time,'' says Ron Kumin,
administrative director of the Duke drama program.
   Nearly 30 percent of Duke's 10,000 students will see the show
before the end of its run Feb. 25, Kumin estimates. Tour bus
companies are bringing in theatergoers from neighboring states and a
sizable press contingent has arrived, from as far away as Chicago
and Dallas, to see the play before it opens on Broadway in March.
   The object of all this hoopla is the 41-year-old Baryshnikov. So
far, he has kept his appearances confined to the stage. A news
conference, scheduled for his arrival last week, was ``temporarily
postponed due to rehearsal restraints,'' and there have been no
interviews.
   In his only published comments about the production, the
Russian-born dancer told Connoisseur magazine that ``Metamorphosis''
was a ``scary project ... It's just putting my neck under the ax for
people to say `Stick with dancing.'''
   So far, he has not had to worry. Rehearsals, which began the
first week of January in New York, have gone smoothly, according to
production staff members, although one actor in a minor role in the
six-character play was replaced.
   The other actors have been impressed with Baryshnikov's work.
   ``Misha is so totally modest and unassuming,'' says Laura
Esterman, who plays his mother in ``Metamorphosis.'' ``He's new to
acting on stage with words, so he's very open, extremely cooperative
and anxious to learn.''
   Baryshnikov has an exacting teacher in Steven Berkoff, who wrote
and directed this version of the Kafka story about a young man who
gradually turns into a bug and whose family tolerates, rejects and
finally destroys him.
   Berkoff, an English actor, director and playwright, already has
made his mark on New York theater this season with a critically
acclaimed and radically reworked production of Shakespeare's
``Coriolanus,'' starring Christopher Walken and Irene Worth.
   ``Metamorphosis'' was first performed in London in 1969 and there
have been nearly a dozen other versions since. Last year, Roman
Polanski starred in a Paris production which Baryshnikov saw and
liked.
   The New York production, which will cost some $460,000, is
produced by Lars Schmidt, who presented the show in Paris, and Roger
L. Stevens, former head of the Kennedy Center in Washington. It will
have a top ticket price in New York of $42.50, the highest for any
drama now on Broadway.
   Duke students were given a chance to work on ``Metamorphosis.''
Some 200 responded to an ad in The Chronicle, the campus newspaper,
and 44 were chosen to help with everything from props to publicity
to stage managing to transportation.
   ``It's been pretty hard to remember you're a student,'' says
Jolie Gabler, one of two students assigned to coordinate
transportation for the actors and production staff. ``It's been
pretty hectic.''
   Baryshnikov declined the services of a chauffeur, preferring to
drive himself around town. ``He doesn't like anyone to make a
fuss,'' Gabler says.
   They will anyway. He was the center of attention Saturday at a
party following a black tie benefit performance of the play for the
Duke Drama Department.
   But the attention won't affect Baryshnikov's performance, the
work of the other actors or the audiences, says Esterman.
   ``If we're interesting, they'll watch us. If we're boring,
they'll watch Misha. And sometimes, they'll watch both,'' she says.
``But hopefully, they'll just be watching the play.''

<HEAD>Serving Up Revolutionary Recipes From 1789: Let Them Eat Pig's Feet</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Legend has it that King Louis XVI lost his head over
a pig's foot _ no surprise in this culinary capital, where
gastronomy ranks as fine art and eating is a sacred ritual.
   So it was fitting that a pig's foot, cooked to perfection from a
recipe dating to the French Revolution, was the first offering in an
11-course feast prepared by six famous French chefs and served up
Monday night to 280 guests at the Pre Catalan restaurant in the Bois
de Bologne.
   The culinary extravaganza, called ``If 1789 Was Cooked For Me,''
was part of the Revolution's bicentennial celebration. Invited
guests included show business celebrities, cabinet ministers and
members of the diplomatic corps.
   Guests were greeted by costumed footmen and lasses in low-cut
dresses with bustles, and they dined off recreations of Havilland
china from the period.
   The food was fit for kings. Yet each course, carefully researched
by food historians Claude Quetel, Philip and Mary Hyman, was
standard middle-class fare 200 years ago.
   ``We were very careful to choose simple dishes that people
actually ate,'' Quetel said in an interview.
   The dinner, he said, was a way of subduing the passions still
unleashed by the French Revolution.
   ``That's one sure way to get the French to agree. On the right or
the left, the French know good food from bad,'' he said.
   Back in 1789, bourgeois Parisians dined on a stew of boiled
capon, a dish that fell out of favor when American turkeys were
introduced.
   Joel Robuchon, chef at the restaurant Jamin in Paris, selected
the finest specially raised nine-pound birds, at $12 a pound, but
roasted them inside a crust of sea salt, instead of boiling them.
   ``That way, you can be sure that all the breasts aren't
overcooked, or the legs undercooked,'' Robuchon said.
   Also popular in the late 18th century was the hearty ``garbure''
_ a version of corned beef and cabbage that later became one of
France's greatest specialties before nearly disappearing altogether.
   The creation of Alain Dutournier, chef at Le Carre des Feuillants
in Paris, this delicacy from the Gascogny region in southwestern
France was one of the most appreciated dishes of the evening.
   ``It's definitely my favorite. It has taste, it has body,'' said
Guy Legay, chef at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.
   Quetel said the recipe for the cabbage soup was unearthed in a
19th century cookbook, ``Cuisinier Durand.'' Its author had cooked
for years for a marquis, but lost his job in the Revolution and
opened his own restaurant in Nimes.
   In 1789, in the south of France, fresh fish too small to be sold
at market were poached in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and
anchovies by the fishermen who hauled them in. Prepared by Alain
Ducasse of the ``Hotel de Paris'' in Monte Carlo, ``la matelote du
poissonier'' is considered to be the revolutionary ancestor of the
Provencal bouillabaisse.
   Stuffed carp was inspired by a 1739 recipe and prepared by
Antoine Westermann, chef at Le Burerehiesel in Strasbourg.
Fresh-water fish appeared on the finest tables until the 19th
century when salt-water fish came into favor.
   Jean Bardet, chef-owner of a restaurant in Tours which bears his
name, said he cooked _ and ate _ dozens of pigs' feet before getting
the centuries-old ``Ste. Menehould'' recipe right.
   ``I had a recipe from 1758 naming the different spices used:
cinnamon, the shell of fresh nutmeg, coriander and cloves,'' Bardet
said. ``The problem was that there was no mention of proportions, so
I spent two weeks trying different combinations. I ended up gaining
seven kilos (15 pounds).''
   Louis XVI, according to legend, was undone by his penchant for
pigs' feet. Fleeing the Revolution in 1791, he insisted on stopping
in Ste. Menould, a small town near Reims, long enough to savor the
house speciality of the Soleil d'Or inn. That's where his foes
caught him, and he was returned to Paris where he was guillotined in
1793.
   Master baker Lionel Poilane concocted a special bicentennial
bread made from spelt flour, a coarse wheat flour that was a staple
in 1789 and now a rarity.
   Even though the French of yesteryear consumed many fewer desserts
than today, Gaston Lenotre resuscitated five from the past,
including an unusual carrot tart with a crunchy caramel topping.
Provencal pastry balls were so hard that some guests joked they
would have made great revolutionary cannon fodder.
   The culinary extravaganza was sponsored by the 230-year-old
champagne house Henri Abele.
   Champagne was not popular during the Revolution, but it was Louis
XVI's favorite drink, and he is said to have consumed a bottle at
each meal, even in the final days before his beheading.

   A Houston attorney who fatally shot
one of the world's few remaining whooping cranes last month has been
indicted on a charge of violating the Endangered Species Act.
   Mario Max Yzaguirre, 28, was indicted by a federal grand jury
last week. If convicted, he faces a maximum one year in prison and
$100,000 fine. He is to be arraigned Feb. 17.
   Texas Parks and Wildlife Department officials have said the
department also will seek $11,000 in restitution from Yzaguirre.
   Yzaguirre was out of his office Tuesday and could not be
immediately reached for comment, his secretary said.
   Yzaguirre has said the crane was flying through heavy fog and he
mistook the bird for a snow goose.
   Only about 200 whooping cranes remain, about 130 of which roost
each winter along Texas' Gulf Coast. Before conservation efforts
began, there were only 21 whooping cranes in Texas during winter.

<TEXT>
   The explosive device that blew up New York-bound
Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland on Dec. 21 was concealed in a
radio-cassette recorder and was traced to Frankfurt's airport, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The Jerusalem Post quoted unidentified investigators as saying
the device was similar, but not identical to one found earlier in
the possession of members of Ahmed Jibril's extremist Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   More than a dozen members of the group were arrested in West
Germany in late October, two months before the Pan Am bombing that
killed 270 people _ all 259 on board and 11 on the ground at
Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Police found among those arrested a sophisticated
barometric-pressure detonating device, the Jerusalem Post said. It
quoted investigators as saying the device used in the Pan Am bombing
had a ``remarkably similar'' design.
   The newspaper quoted investigators as saying the radio-cassette
recorder was transferred at Frankfurt's Rhein-Main Airport from
another plane to a Boeing 727 flying to London.
   At London's Heathrow Airport, baggage from the 727, including the
radio-cassette recorder, was transferred to Pan Am's New York-bound
Flight 103, the paper said in a report from London.
   Investigators have not identified the bag in which the device was
hidden, the newspaper said.
   Last week, a British radio station said Scottish police believe
Palestinian extremists hid an explosive device in the luggage of an
American CIA officer who was flying home from Beirut with five
colleagues after a failed mission to negotiate the release of U.S.
hostages in Lebanon.
   CBS television said Syria and Libya were responsible for the
bombing and that it was carried out by Jibril's group, a
Syrian-sponsored faction outside the Palestine Liberation
Organiztion.
   The New York Times, in its Wednesday editions, quoted an
unidentified U.S. official as saying suspicion of Jibril's group had
been bolstered by evidence linking it with hard-line factions in the
Iranian government.

<HEAD>Soviet Human Rights Activist Asks Europe's Help to Free Armenian
Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov has appealed for Western Europe's
help in freeing 11 of Armenian nationalist leaders who Soviet
authorities have imprisoned, Socialist Party officials said.
   The Soviet human rights activist met Tuesday with Socialist
leader and former Premier Bettino Craxi.
   Sakharov, a physicist and winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize,
is in Italy to accept academic and civic honors in his second
foreign trip since being freed from seven years of internal exile in
1986.
   Sakharov told Craxi ``something absolutely needs to be done'' by
Western Europe to free members of the Karabakh Committee, according
to Margherita Boniver, a parliamentarian and the Socialists' foreign
relations spokeswoman.
   All 11 committee members were arrested in December for allegedly
fanning ethnic tensions in the southern Soviet republic of Armenia
but have not been formally charged.
   The committee has spearheaded a campaign by Armenians to gain
control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave of the
neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
   Clashes between Armenians, most of whom are Christian, and
Azerbaijanis, who are predominantly Moslem, broke out last year in
the two republics over the Armenian demands for annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In Moscow on Tuesday, a Soviet official released the highest
estimates yet of the human toll in the unrest. Maj. Gen. Nikolai
Vasko of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said 91 people were killed
and injured 1,650 in last year's ethnic violence, the official Tass
news agency reported.
   The rioting so terrified Armenians and Azerbaijanis living in
each other's republics that nearly 300,000 fled their homes, Tass
quoted him as saying.
   Less than a sixth of the refugees have since returned home,
according to Vasko. Previous reports had placed the death toll from
the violence at more than 70, with 200,000 refugees.
   Sakharov called the imprisonment of the Karabakh committee
members ``a step backward in view of the decision made in Vienna''
last month, at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,
to organize a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991, Mrs.
Boniver told The Associated Press.
   The two also discussed this spring's Soviet parliamentary
elections, in which Sakharov is a candidate, and the new forces of
democratization and economic modernization in the Soviet Union, a
Socialist Party statement said.
   Sakharov later met with top Italian scientists and thanked them
for helping improve the plight of Soviet dissidents, the Italian
news agency ANSA reported. He also cautioned the scientists about
their responsibilities for ``the dangers of global nature that can
derive from science, like those of nuclear war or ecological
disaster,'' ANSA said.

   They didn't have to flip to pick the winner
of the annual Shrove Tuesday pancake race. An English gym instructor
easily defeated a Kansas aerobics teacher to retain her title.
   Lesley Byrne, 26, of Olney, England, ran her hometown, 415-yard
course, carrying a frying pan with a pancake, in 62 seconds. That
was quicker than 23-year-old Donetta Schindler, who beat 14 others
on a similar Kansas course with a time of 65.91 seconds.
   ``My legs feel really bad. I thought I was fitter because I'd
been training. I'll be coming back next year to try for the
hat-trick,'' Mrs. Byrne said.
   ``I felt like I was in good position,'' said Mrs. Schindler, a
former tennis player at Liberal High School. ``I was ready for it,
but I had not trained that much.''
   According to legend, the race has been run in Olney since 1445,
when a woman dashed to church on Shrove Tuesday still clutching her
frying pan with a pancake in it. Some say the pancake may have been
a bribe to the bellringer to ring the bell sooner to signal the
start of celebrations on the last day before Lent, which
traditionally include pancakes.
   In 1950, women in Liberal in southwest Kansas began challenging
Olney.
   Runners in both races wore the traditional garb of skirt, apron
and headscarf. The winners exchange inscribed silver trays from the
two towns and other prizes.
   This year's victory was the seventh straight for the English,
giving them a slight 20-19 edge in the series.

   It's taken 52 years for the Nassau Inn to
get back a sign stolen by two Princeton University students as a
prank, and the innkeeper isn't taking any chances with it this time.
   After the Class of '37 graduated, the sign graced the rooms of
succeeding Princeton students. During World War II it was stored in
a coal bin in New York, then in a garage in Batavia, Ill. In 1954,
it turned up in Short Hills and a volunteer group restored it in
East Aurora, N.Y.
   Now, the Class of '37 plans to return the 2-by-5-foot
hand-painted sign to the entrance of the 200-year-old inn during a
ceremony Feb. 18.
   ``It's great to be able to have our original sign back after 52
years,'' innkeeper Nelson Zager said Tuesday. He said about 100
members of the original 300 in the class are expected to return for
the event.
   The sign will be better secured this time around.
   ``Lest any modern-day prankster become inspired to repeat
Princeton history, our engineers have assured us that the formerly
`permanent' sign is now truly permanent thanks to modern alloy ...
and an electric alarm system,'' Zager said.

   The breakfast sausage to be served at this
week's Governor's Conference on Agriculture isn't exactly kosher in
Michigan, but no one is complaining.
   A 1952 state law listing all the ingredients retailers are
allowed to stuff into sausage includes honey, eggs and garlic _ but
not cherries.
   ``But it's not exactly illegal, either,'' said Robert Jason, a
regional supervisor for the Agriculture Department's food division
in Traverse City. ``When the law was made in 1952, nobody ever
thought to put fruit in sausage.''
   He said state regulators are looking the other way until someone
can amend the state's sausage laws.
   Ray Pleva, a butcher who developed the cherry pecan sausage that
will grace the tables at the conference, has sidestepped the sausage
law by having a wholesale sausage company stuff his links.
   Federal law, which regulates sausage wholesalers, allows fruity
fillers.

<HEAD>Investigators Say Brakes Not Set On Rail Cars Involved In Collision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators looking into last week's train
collision and explosion say that no hand brakes were set on any of
the 48 runaway rail cars that rolled backwards for nine miles and
slammed into three locomotives.
   Edward Dobranetski, chief investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board, said it is not known yet why the hand
brakes were not used, and the ``human factor'' is being closely
scrutinized.
   Mike Lemm, Montana Rail Link trainmaster in Helena, said
preliminary tests show the train's air brakes, a separate braking
system that operates from within the locomotive, were working
properly. But more tests are under way, he said.
   Twenty-one cars derailed in the collision and one containing
hydrogen peroxide exploded, shattering windows up to two miles away
and hurling debris hundreds of yards.
   No serious injuries were reported but the explosion knocked out
power to much of the city of 37,000 and forced evacution of about
2,000 people when the temperature was about 30 degrees below zero.
   The train crew had detached the cars from the lead locomotive to
exchange it with another one containing a better heater, the Federal
Railroad Administration reported in its initial investigation last
Thursday, the day of the explosion.
   On Monday, Dobranetski said the cars were separated from the
locomotives after the lead engine lost power.
   He also said hand brakes are to be set if the train is on a steep
grade to serve as a backup to air brakes. The portion of track where
the train was disconnected is classified as ``mountain grade,'' he
said, adding that it appears the train crew violated railroad
regulations by failing to set the hand brakes.
   Investigators are still trying to determine whether
record-breaking cold played a part in the accident.
   ``Weather has an effect on any device,'' Dobranetski said. ``But
we are not sure yet what role it played in this accident.''

   House Speaker Jim Wright's defeat in the
congressional pay raise controversy leaves him weakened but in no
immediate danger of being knocked out of his job, say lawmakers of
both parties.
   ``There will be some lingering resentment,'' said Democratic Rep.
Tim Penny, a fourth-term lawmaker from Minnesota and one of only a
handful of Democrats to criticize the Speaker publicly for his
handling of the pay-raise fight.
   ``There's going to have to be some fence-mending over the next
few months before this thing is put behind us,'' Penny said.
   But Democratic leaders in the House rallied around Wright after
his strategy of winning a pay raise without a vote collapsed.
   ``Members came to the river, stuck their toes in, and said
`uh-uh,''' added Democratic Caucus Chairman William Gray, D-Pa.
``Jim Wright can lead you to the river, but at some point you have
to get your feet wet.''
   While Penny criticized Wright for advocating the pay raise,
others complained privately that the speaker displayed too little
leadership in the face of opposition to the $45,500 increase.
   Others said he failed to consult with fellow Democrats in time to
avert the overwhelming vote Tuesday on the House floor that killed
the raise and opened the possibility that there will be no raise for
the foreseeable future.
   Still there was some after-the-fact sympathy for the man who not
only carried the weight of the House, but also of the judiciary, the
executive branch and the Senate on the pay-raise issue.
   ``We can't hide behind one man. We've got to go out and make an
appeal to the American people,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., a
leading advocate of the raise. ``We simply had too many people
laying back letting someone else do the heavy lifting.''
   Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California said any obituaries on
Wright's speakership were premature.
   ``I was around when O'Neill was definitely out,'' he said in
reference to the former House speaker who endured a string of
setbacks early in President Reagan's term in office, but went on to
serve the longest continuous term of any speaker.
   ``I've said repeatedly the speaker is not in trouble, should not
be in trouble and could not be in trouble,'' Coelho added. ``The
only way he could be in trouble is if there were another candidate''
to oppose him as speaker.
   A batch of ``Foley for Speaker'' buttons appeared at the Capitol
on Tuesday, apparently an effort by a conservative group to rub salt
into Wright's wounds. But Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash.,
repudiated the suggestion.
   Wright's lead role in the pay-raise battle brought him political
heat unmatched in his controversial two-year tenure as speaker,
which includes a pending ethics case.
   Significantly, much of that heat came in his economically
depressed home state of Texas and in his congressional district in
Fort Worth, where the idea of a $45,500 raise was even harder to
justify to the public than in much of the rest of the country.
   An aide to Wright, John Mack, likened the speaker's position to
that of a reluctant leader of a cattle drive: ``We signed up for
Kansas, but we didn't want to go there. Now everybody's shooting the
trail boss.''
   Some heat was felt, as well, by House Minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-Ill. A hometown newspaper article carried criticism of him
for privately favoring the pay raise, but publicly voting against it.
   Republicans predicted that the cost to Wright of the pay fight
would be a period of extreme caution, in which the speaker would be
forced to stay in the background and avoid the kinds of risky moves
that have been his trademark.

   The Congressional Budget Office is offering an
assortment of deficit reduction proposals that contain potentially
large savings, but most have little appeal to lawmakers.
   In its annual menu of suggested ways to slash the federal
budget's perennial imbalances, the non-partisan CBO on Tuesday
advanced scores of ideas that are frequently discussed and just as
consistently swatted down in the face of vocal criticism.
   Eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes would
raise $4.1 billion for federal coffers next year. A 5 percent
national sales tax, which probably could not go into effect until
fiscal 1991, would collect $82 billion that year. Applying the
Medicare payroll tax to individual wages above $48,000 would bring
in another $3.1 billion, the CBO said.
   Each of these would help meet deficit reduction goals for the
next few years. For fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, the
Gramm-Rudman law sets a deficit target of $100 billion, which the
White House says will require $27 billion in savings.
   But President Bush has pledged to not raise taxes, and even
members of Congress who say new taxes are necessary prefer to talk
about levies on items such as gasoline, alcohol and tobacco.
   Other options described by CBO have attracted equally little
enthusiasm.
   Eliminating next year's scheduled cost-of-living increase for
recipients of Social Security, federal railroad, civilian and
military retirement and veterans' compensation programs would save
$10.6 billion next year and $69 billion over five years. But few
politicians are willing to tangle with Social Security recipients
and veterans, two vocal lobbies.
   Other possibilities outlined by CBO include:
   _Raising $200 million next year by limiting interest deductions
that may be claimed by corporations that borrow to take over other
companies.
   _Limiting deductions on business meals and entertainment to 50
percent of their value, rather than the current 80 percent, to raise
$1.8 billion next year.
   _Boosting federal taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel by 12 cents
per gallon to raise $12 billion next year, or imposing a $5 per
barrel oil import fee to produce $7.7 billion.
   _Doubling the 16 cents tax per pack of cigarettes to raise $2.9
billion, and raising $4.7 billion by increasing federal taxes on a
750 milliliter bottle of wine from 3 cents to 54 cents and on a
six-pack of beer from 16 cents to 63 cents.
   _Restraining the growth in spending for the Star Wars
anti-missile research program to only 5 percent per year, saving
$880 million next year.
   _Having U.S. allies pay the salaries of their natives working on
American overseas military bases, and pay for utilities and other
maintenance costs on the bases, a $2.5 billion savings in 1990.
   _Eliminating 15,000 military personnel in response to the
intermediate-range nuclear weapons treaty between the United States
and the Soviet Union, a $110 million savings.
   _Increasing the Medicare deductible for doctors' services from
$75 per year to $200 per year for a $1.5 billion savings.
   _Raising the 1 percent fee the Veterans Administration charges to
guarantee home loans to 1.75 percent, producing $290 million in
savings.
   _Saving $5.1 billion by lowering the target prices used to
determine farmers' deficiency payments by 5 percent.
   _Canceling development of NASA's planned space station, a $390
million savings next year.

<HEAD>Arctic Blast Could Hurt Winter Wheat</HEAD>

   The frigid push of arctic weather may have
damaged winter wheat in parts of the central and southern plains,
says a government report.
   But winter wheat in the northern plains and the Corn Belt
benefited from a protective layer of snow during the week of Jan.
30-Feb. 5 as the huge arctic system caused temperatures to plummet.
   ``In Kansas, winter wheat was mostly poor to fair,'' said the
report released Tuesday. ``Extreme cold temperatures late in the
week may have caused widespread winterkill, but the extent of the
damage was still unknown.''
   Cold weather ``greatly reduced greenbug activity'' in the
Oklahoma winter wheat crop, but raised the possibility of winterkill
in the western area of the state, the report said.
   Severe cold also put heavy stress on livestock in the Northwest
and Great Plains. The low temperatures and wind were especially hard
on newborn calves and lambs, and above-normal losses were expected
in some areas, the report said.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, grain and soybean futures on
Tuesday closed about unchanged from the day before. Analysts said
the markets had anticipated some wheat winterkill because of the
cold.
   Moreover, forecasts for more snow in the Great Plains have had a
dampening effect on commodity markets.
   ``There is a growing realization among traders that the odds of a
back-to-back crop adversity in (the) Midwest are extremely small,''
said Richard Feltes of Refco Inc., a Chicago-based commodities
brokerage firm.
   The Agriculture Department has been saying for months that a
repeat of last year's heavy drought losses is unlikely, although
some areas are still far below normal in soil moisture.
   Norton D. Strommen, the USDA's chief meteorologist, says
precipitation from now until the end of April ``can further improve
soil moisture levels and yield potential of wheat areas'' in the
Great Plains.
   Also, he said earlier this week, timely spring and summer rains,
along with favorable temperatures, will be the key to crop prospects
this summer, and there is ``little correlation'' between drought
indicators this winter and prospective crop yields for 1989.
   Looking at other crops and field activities, the report said:
   _Snow and low temperatures limited plowing and fertilizing in the
plains and Corn Belt. Land preparation for spring planting continued
in the Southeast but was limited by rain in parts of the Delta.
   _Land preparation for the 1989 cotton crop continued in Arizona
and California.
   _Tobacco plant bed preparation and seeding continued in the
Southeast. Georgia's tobacco plants were in mostly good condition.
Plant bed preparation was under way in Virginia.
   _Rain was needed in Florida's citrus areas. Groves have abundant
new foliage and bloom buds. The early orange harvest was very active.
   Abnormally warm, dry weather continued throughout Florida's major
vegetable areas. Plant development was ahead of normal.

   American farmers and exporters should change
the way they view Australia and start thinking about Down Under as a
land of sales opportunities, says Jim Parker, the U.S. agricultural
counselor in Canberra.
   ``Instead of always thinking of Australia as an exporting
competitor, U.S. exporters should remember that the United States
supplies about 15 percent of Australia's agricultural product
needs,'' Parker said.
   Australia is a tough competitor in some of the world's commodity
markets _ wheat and beef are major examples _ but Parker said there
is no reason Australia and the United States still can't trade with
each other.
   Currently, Australia imports about $1.5 billion worth of
agricultural products, with the United States providing only $250
million of the total, mostly lumber, tobacco, soybeans and soybean
products, horticultural products and processed food.
   ``We have room to grow, but in order to grow, we have to start
thinking of Australia as a market and not as a competitor,'' Parker
says in the current issue of AgExporter magazine published by the
Agriculture Department. ``There are about 16 million people in
Australia. They appreciate good food and have the money to afford
it.''
   About 86 percent of Australians live in cities, and only about 6
percent of the nation's work force of 7 million people are farmers.
Convenience foods offer a large sales potential, he said.
   ``There are more dual-income families in Australia,'' Parker
said. ``With both the husband and wife working, neither is thrilled
with the idea of cooking a big meal at the end of a long day. Like
Americans, they want something tasty, fast and easy.''
   Also, he said, U.S. groups are working to introduce and promote
American beef at first-class hotels in all of Australia's major
cities. Parker said that a third of Australian diners now request
U.S. beef when ordering steak off the menu.
   Parker said U.S. lumber has a potentially bright future in
Australia. Despite efforts to increase domestic softwood lumber
production, demand continues to grow.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says he
will seek strong measures against air terrorism when he attends an
international meeting in Montreal next week but will oppose steps
that put U.S. airlines at a business disadvantage.
   Skinner, at his first news conference as secretary, on Monday
rejected the idea of public warnings of terrorist threats. He also
announced that he would replace Federal Aviation Administrator Alan
McArtor, who he said has asked to return to private business.
   The Montreal meeting of the Council of the International Civil
Aviation Organization Feb. 15-16 was called to find ways to improve
international standards for passenger, baggage and cargo security.
Top transportation officials from the 33 council member nations have
been invited.
   Skinner did not give details of the steps the United States would
seek at the Montreal conference but said worldwide safety measures
are needed. He said restrictions should not apply only to U.S.
airlines.
   U.S. and British officials called for the session after the
explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed all 259 people aboard and
11 other people on the ground in Scotland Dec. 21. Authorities say a
bomb blew up the plane and they are still considering several
possible perpetrators, methods and motives.
   Families of Flight 103 victims called Monday for McArtor's
resignation for FAA failure to ensure safety of the
Frankfurt-London-New York flight and warn passengers of threats
against the flight.
   ``If we were to shut down airlines every time there is a threat,
we will allow terrorists to disrupt the economy of not only this
nation but every nation in the world,'' Skinner said.
   Skinner said McArtor had done a ``good job in many aspects'' but
has said he wants to step down. McArtor had indicated he wanted to
leave prior to the security concerns raised by the destruction of
Flight 103.
   On other topics:
   _Skinner said he will decide within a few days whether to allow
lower mileage standards for the automobile industry than the 27.5
miles-per-gallon average scheduled to go into effect for 1990
models. The industry claims the tougher standard would be too costly
and force car makers to produce smaller cars the public won't buy.
The current standard is 26.5 miles per gallon.
   _He said mass transit systems should be weaned away from federal
funding but the government cannot ``just cut off the spigot of
federal funds.'' Skinner headed the mass transit system in Northern
Illinois before becoming secretary.
   _The new secretary rejected for now the idea of reorganizing the
department as proposed by his predecessor, James Burnley, but said
he would try to make the present setup work and might look at
reorganization later.

   Health experts say defeat of the federal pay
raise will further hinder efforts to recruit and retain scientists
for the government's battle against AIDS.
   Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Frank Young told a
Senate panel that scientists who are paid about $60,000 annually at
his agency ``can leave for salaries of four or five times'' that.
   Testifying to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
hours before Congress voted Tuesday to deny itself a 51 percent pay
raise, Young said the FDA was in much the same predicament as the
National Institutes of Health, which said recently it had been
unable to recruit a senior scientist in the last 10 years.
   The pay raise measure that Congress rejected included increases
of $40,000 to $59,500 for top-level officials in the executive
branch. Among those would have been scientists for the FDA and NIH.
   The commissioner said the agency's drug review division where the
number of applications for new AIDS drug research had doubled was
especially hard hit by the shortage of scientists.
   For example, he said, the FDA hadn't anticipated that the number
of applications for AIDS drug research would double, that there
would be annual instead of biannual inspections of the nation's drug
supply, or that there would be problems with inspections of condoms
and rubber gloves.
   ``We're in a difficult position of knowing how to prepare a
budget,'' Young also said, because ``we can't anticipate two years
ahead'' as the federal budget process requires.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   As of Jan. 2 the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said
there were 32,311 AIDS cases reported in the United States in 1988,
a 57 percent increase from a year before.

   Leaders of the legal profession contend that
federal judges are the biggest losers in the congressional vote to
scuttle hefty pay raises for top government officials.
   While members of Congress ``can still supplement their income''
with speech-making fees and political committee contributions,
``judges are left with salaries that have decreased in real dollars
by 30 percent over the past two decades,'' American Bar Association
President Robert Raven said Tuesday.
   ``The recommended increase for federal judges did little more
than restore lost ground,'' said Raven, a San Francisco lawyer.
   John J. Curtin Jr., a Boston lawyer who in August will become
president of the 350,000-lawyer ABA, said the lost pay raise for
judges ``will destroy their morale.''
   ``The fallout on the federal judiciary is going to be
devastating,'' Curtin said, adding that his organization will lobby
President Bush and Congress to raise the pay of federal judges only.
   Had the raise taken effect today, salaries for federal trial
judges _ like those of members of Congress _ would have climbed from
$89,500 to $135,000 a year.
   The annual salaries of federal appellate judges would have risen
from $95,000 to $145,000; Supreme Court justices from $110,000 to
$165,000; and chief justice from $115,000 to $175,000.
   ``Congress' rejection of the pay raise quells a political
firestorm over raising congressional salaries but foments a serious
problem within the federal judiciary,'' Raven said.
   He said that inflation-eroded pay for federal judges ``flouts the
wisdom of our Constitution'' and the lifetime judicial appointments
it provides.
   ``Inadequate and decreasing pay forces all but independently
wealthy judges to forgo their life tenure and market their
experience and training on the bench in the more lucrative arena of
private (law) firms,'' Raven said.
   Salaries of federal judges have been raised six times this decade
_ and now are 24 percent higher than they were in 1980. But the cost
of living, as measured by the Consumers Price Index, has risen by 46
percent over the same period.
   Since 1969 _ a period in which many federal judges say their
buying power has dropped by a third _ the cost of living has risen
by 227 percent.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist had called the pay raises
``essential if we are to continue to attract from the financially
greener fields of private practice the sort of experienced and
capable lawyers whom we want as judges.''
   During House debate on the pay raise Tuesday, Rep. Vic Fazio,
D-Calif., emphasized the problem for judges. ``There are Supreme
Court justices who make less than their clerks the day after they
(the clerks) go into private practice,'' Fazio said.
   Raven said Fazio's comment was ``not far off,'' and noted that
some law firms offer starting salaries of $76,000 a year.
   ``Certainly a starting lawyer who receives two years' credit for
having worked as a law clerk immediately is making more than a trial
judge,'' Raven said.

   Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck was listed in
critical but stable condition after a successful triple-bypass heart
operation, doctors said.
   Brubeck, 68, underwent 4{ hours of surgery at Yale-New Haven
Hospital on Tuesday and was placed in the intensive care unit,
hospital spokeswoman Cathy Zaorski said.
   She said Brubeck would remain in the hospital up to 10 days.
   Doctors had been watching Brubeck's problems with clogged
arteries for about eight years, but decided only recently that he
should undergo surgery, Brubeck's manager Russell Gloyd said.
   Brubeck, who lives in Wilton, plans to resume limited travel and
performances in a few months, Gloyd said.
   Gloyd said he was unsure when Brubeck would be able to perform
again.
   ``We're looking at that right now. It's all going to depend on
his recovery. We're hoping that within two to three months he can
begin a limited performance schedule.''

   Dealmaking developer Donald Trump has found
something else to put his name on: a new board game similar to _
what else _ Monopoly.
   Trump appeared Tuesday with representatives of Milton Bradley Co.
at a Trump Tower news conference to unveil ``Trump _ The Game.''
   ``Trump'' is somewhat like Parker Bros.'s Monopoly in that the
player with the most money wins. But the Trump ``T'' has replaced
Monopoly game pieces like the shoe, the thimble and the iron, and
the highest Trump denomination is $100 million instead of $500.
   And unlike Monopoly, the new game features pictures of Trump the
man on the money, game board, playing cards and the box.
   ``It's a much more sophisticated game than Monopoly,'' Trump
said. ``I like to play Monopoly _ I've played it all my life, in
many forms.''
   Capitalists ages 12 and older are invited to ``share in the
exciting high-stakes risk-taking I get to do every day. ... If you
are clever, aggressive and cut the best deals, you can earn millions
... even billions of dollars. Just remember: Play to win ... or not
at all!''
   Trump said his proceeds from the $25 game, which will hit
toy-store shelves this spring, will go to causes like cerebral
palsy, AIDS and the homeless.

   Sir Rudolf Bing, former Metropolitan Opera
impresario and victim of Alzheimer's disease, was unaware he had
married Carroll Douglass when he was interviewed 18 months after the
wedding, a psychiatrist said.
   Dr. Barry Reisberg testified Tuesday at a state Supreme Court
hearing on whether the 87-year-old Bing's January 1987 marriage to
Ms. Douglass, a former mental patient, should be annulled. Lawyers
for Bing contend he is incompetent and had no idea what he was doing.
   Reisberg, who said he examined Bing last June, testified: ``I
asked him if he was married and he said, `No.' I asked him if he
knew Lady Carroll Douglass Bing and he said that he did. He stated
that she was a friend.''
   The psychiatrist said Bing did not have the ``cognitive
wherewithal at that time to enter into a marriage contract.''
   Roberto Mei, owner of the Fontana di Trevi restaurant, which was
frequented by the Bings, testified that Bing agreed at his wife's
suggestion to accompany her to England.
   A few minutes later, Mei said, he walked by Bing's table and
heard him ask Ms. Douglass, ``And what did you say your name was?''
   The Bings subsequently went on an apparently aimless odyssey with
stops in Florida, the Caribbean and England, depending in large part
on the help of strangers.

the Broadway version is budgeted at $1.25 million.
   The producers said they signed an agreement with Ms. King and
Colgems EMI Music Inc., her publisher, for permission to use her
songs. The show, named after her Grammy award-winning 1971 album,
includes more than 40 of Ms. King's songs.
   David Strong Warner Inc. of New York will be executive producer

   Former professional boxer Mitch ``Blood'' Green,
best known for losing matches to heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in
the ring and on the street, was arrested for yet another driving
infraction, police said.
   Green, 32, was arrested Tuesday afternoon after police received a
report that drugs were being sold from a car. No drugs were found in
the car or on Green, but police did discover he was driving with a
revoked license, said police spokesman Detective Jim Coleman.
   The ex-fighter also was wanted on a warrant for assault, Coleman
said.
   Green has been arrested at least 54 times for driving infractions
and has previous arrests for drug possession and allegedly striking
a woman friend.
   Green lost a heavyweight title bout with Tyson in 1986. Last
August, the two fought outside a late-night Harlem clothing store,
leaving Tyson with a broken hand and Green with a cut nose and puffy
eye. Green dropped assault charges three days later.

   In killing its pay raise, Congress may have
disabled the automatic pilot it devised to get a raise without
voting for one _ something like the autopens that sign letters here
without human intervention.
   People concerned with the issue said it now may be impossible for
Congress to get an increase unless the Constitution is amended to
take the decision away from Congress.
   And they say it may be impossible to get a constitutional
amendment through state legislatures unsympathetic to Washington's
wants.
   In fact, said political scientist R. Kent Weaver of the Brookings
Institution, the only state legislators likely to support a
constitutional amendment are ``those who want to go to Congress, and
then it would be used against them.''
   The constitutional change most often discussed would create an
independent body to fix the government's top salaries, with Congress
barred from playing any role.
   ``But the talk show hosts of American would have a field day with
that, too,'' says former Rep. William Ratchford, D-Conn., who was a
member of the presidential commission that recommended the 51
percent raise roundly rejected Tuesday in the Capitol.
   Radio talk show hosts mounted an anti-raise campaign that helped
motivate Congress to abandon plans to let the pay boost take quiet,
automatic effect at midnight.
   ``The first time a constitutional amendment worked,'' said
Ratchford, ``there would be an effort to repeal the amendment.''
   Nonetheless, argued William M. Agee, another commission member,
``we need to take it out of the political arena. There has to be a
way this issue is depoliticized.'' Agee is chairman and chief
executive officer of Morrison Knudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho, a big
shipbuilding, engineering and construction outfit.
   An amendment appears necessary because the constitution seems to
say that fixing its pay is a congressional responsibility. It says
members ``shall receive a compensation for their services, to be
ascertained by law.''
   Former Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee once
proposed altering the Constitution to let the Supreme Court fix
congressional pay. He has said Congress ``is institutionally
incapable of setting its own salary.''
   Critics asked who would set the court's pay, and when Baker said
Congress would the idea was rejected as a classic case of
backscratching.
   ``Well, it leaves the country with a problem,'' said former Sen.
Charles McC. Mathias, R-Md., also a member of the commission. ``The
problem is that we postponed it (a pay raise for the top levels in
government) for too many years and postponing it further is simply
going to aggravate the problem.''
   ``The reason we recommended 50 percent is because the small
percentage increases were not taken year by year, and that
difficulty will only grow bigger as long as we wait,'' he added.
   One idea afloat in the aftermath of Tuesday's vote called for
letting Congress vote for a pay raise for the new Congress, the one
that will be elected in November 1990.
   ``It wouldn't work,'' said Weaver. ``Opponents would have two
years to knock it down. They could attach a repeal to every bill
that came along.''
   Another solution _ mentioned by Mathias, Agee and Weaver _ is to
break the custom by which congressional salaries rise in lockstep
with executive and judicial salaries.
   They suggested that Congress could give judges and government
officials a raise without taking one itself. That solution always
has been rejected by congressmen who felt their worth was no less
than a judge's or a bureaucrat's.
   ``If they could delink themselves, and say, OK, we will not vote
for a raise for ourselves but we will allow one for the executive
branch and the juduciary to go through, it seems to me that would be
a great act of statesmanship,'' said Agee. ``Then they could try to
pass, say, a 20 percent increase for themselves.''

   Congress paid itself between $6 and $8 per
meeting day for the first 67 years of the Republic, and giving
itself a raise has always been a contentious matter, notes the
Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries, the
panel that recommended a now-rejected 51 per cent boost.
   The commission noted that Rep. Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., once
observed that ever since the country's founding, debates over
congressional salaries have ``produced more self-righteousness and
more passionate oratory and more posturing and more nonsense ...
than almost any other subject.''
   The first attempt came in 1816, when Congress voted to fix a pay
scale of $1,500 per session. The uproar was so great the measure was
repealed the next year.
   Lewis Condict, a member from New Jersey, offered this commentary
at the time:
   ``No embargo. No news. Newspaper editors were in danger of
starvation, and for want of other prey, they pounced upon the
compensation law, and, like Peter's brown loaf, it has served them
for beef and mutton, custard and plum pudding. It was standing dish
for months, and was served up in every possible shape, boiled and
roasted, stewed and fricasseed.
   ``Devoured by the demagogues of faction, it has been reissued
from their pestiferous jaws at the tippling houses and dram shops,
highly seasoned with falsehood and misrepressentation. And this is
called `public sentiment' and `public opinion.' This is `instruction
from our constituents,' which the representative is bound to
observe.''
   And in 1873, after Congress increased its pay by 50 percent _
from $5,000 to $7,500 _ the Democratic Convention adopted a
resolution stating: ``We condemn and denounce the salary grab, and
all Congressmen, Democratic or Republican, who voted for it, or have
not renounced all share in plunder seized.''

   National security concerns are plaguing the
Iran-Contra trial of fired National Security Council aide Oliver
North as jury selection in the case draws to a close.
   North's lawyers said Tuesday the government is proposing that
they be required to provide advance notice before disclosing certain
categories of classified information. The proposal was rejected Jan.
30, the day before the trial started, but the government is now
attempting to resurrect it, the lawyers said.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, who said last week that he
doesn't want ``security gurus'' running North's trial, hasn't ruled
on the government's latest request.
   It was understood that independent counsel Lawrence Walsh is
making the proposal on behalf of intelligence agencies with national
security concerns.
   North is accused of shredding evidence and lying to Congress and
the attorney general in an attempt to cover up the Iran-Contra
affair, including the diversion of profits from the Reagan
administration's secret Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels.
   Intelligence agencies object to Gesell's ruling three weeks ago
that North may introduce a wide range of classified information
without prior court order, if it is relevant to his defense.
   That includes classified information tending to show that North's
``intent and purpose was not to violate the law'' or that ``any
statement made by a government witness during the trial is false or
misleading,'' said Gesell's order.
   U.S. intelligence agencies claim those categories are too broad,
said government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gesell also said North will be allowed to present classified
material if any exists to establish that then-President Reagan,
then-Vice President George Bush or anyone at the National Security
Council ``directed, or openly encouraged or condoned'' the coverup.
   Gesell issued the order Jan. 19, but it remained under seal until
Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, North's lawyers moved to stop the trial on grounds
that the jury selection process, which had been under way for six
days, failed to meet legal requirements.
   The number already qualified stands at 45, but Gesell indicated
he wanted a larger pool as insurance.
   The Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968 mandates a random
selection process, but Gesell ``has introduced a non-random
criterion,'' said the filing by North lawyer Brendan Sullivan.
   Gesell passed over all prospective jurors who said they had
watched, listened to or read accounts of North's 1987 immunized
testimony to Congress in which he detailed many of the activities
for which he is now accused of crimes.
   Sullivan claimed the judge's procedure was a violation of the
1968 law. He said it ``can be remedied by excusing all prospective
jurors'' who said initially they hadn't been exposed to the North
testimony, but indicated during open court questioning that they had
been.
   Many of those approved for the pool by Gesell said they were
vaguely aware of the televised hearings but paid no attention to
them.
   However, North lawyer Barry Simon has objected to nearly all of
the prospective jurors on the grounds that they have been exposed to
North's 1987 testimony.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Budget a Slightly Fatter Reagan Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The budget President Bush presents to Congress
this week will be a revision of Ronald Reagan's outgoing plan, but
it won't come close to the rewrite job Reagan did on his
predecessor's farewell spending plan.
   Reagan set his first budget director, David Stockman, to work
with a vengeance on the lame-duck spending plan outgoing Democratic
President Jimmy Carter submitted in January 1981.
   That budget was completely dismantled. Later, Stockman was to
trade his budget ax for a pen and do a dismantling job of another
sorts on Reagan and his former colleagues.
   Reagan went before Congress on Feb. 18, 1981, with a spending
overhaul he boasted was a ``program for economic recovery.'' It
combined the deepest cuts in domestic spending ever proposed, a
large across-the-board cut in income tax rates and a boost in
military spending.
   By contrast, Bush's overhaul amounts to a little tinkering here,
a little adjusting there, to a budget that seemed custom-made for
his modifications.
   Where Stockman went through the Carter budget cutting item after
item, Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, went through the
Reagan budget gingerly adding money to item after item.
   Darman wasn't exactly covering hostile territory. He helped put
some of those program reductions in the Reagan budget in the first
place, apparently knowing full well he'd later be penciling in
increases for Bush's ``kinder, gentler'' society.
   A little fancy budgetary footwork, and a proposal to hold
military spending increases at the rate of inflation, will enable
Bush to assert in his budget address on Thursday that he's making
good on those campaign promises for new initiatives for education,
the homeless, the war on drugs and environmental cleanup.
   Darman is one of the few senior White House officials who fared
well in Stockman's 1986 book, ``The Triumph of Politics.''
   ``His was the only office in the White House where you found a
whole table stacked with serious books that the occupant had
actually read,'' Stockman wrote of Darman, then a White House
assistant.
   ``I came to admire his hard-headed, cogent, and zestful approach
to political strategy,'' Stockman wrote.
   Reagan promised a cut in taxes and a balanced budget by 1983 or
1984. Bush is promising not to raise taxes, and to reach a balanced
budget by 1993 with a so-called ``flexible freeze.''
   Reagan, obviously, didn't come near a balanced budget. In fact,
the annual budget deficit tripled during his presidency, something
Reagan always blamed on Congress.
   Now it's Bush's turn, and many economists claim his proposals
won't come close to balancing the budget either _ with or without a
``flexible freeze.''
   There's actually been the equivalent of a flexible freeze in
place for the past several years, with the growth of federal
spending roughly matching the rate of inflation, but few seem to
have noticed.
   Furthermore, Bush plans to use many of the same economic
assumptions that Reagan plugged into his budget _ and which the
Congressional Budget Office and most private analysts claim are far
too rosy.
   These include a projection of economic growth of over 3 percent
out through 1994; of a drop in short-term interest rates to 3
percent over the same period; and a fall of inflation to under 2
percent.
   The calculations are important, because if interest rates are one
percentage point higher than estimated, it costs the Treasury _ and
increases the deficit _ $11 billion. For each percentage point that
growth lags behind the plugged-in projection, $24 billion is lost.
   Stockman claimed he came upon a cruel realization in his five
years as director of the Office of Management and Budget: ``The
budget gap couldn't be closed except by a dictator.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, had a more fanciful way of
taking care of the nation's troubled finances.
   ``It's all been settled,'' he said emerging from a White House
meeting with Bush on the budget. ``Peggy Noonan will write the
budget.''
   Ms. Noonan is the speechwriter who penned both Bush's convention
acceptance speech and his inaugural address, and who gave him his
two most widely repeated lines: ``a kinder and gentler nation'' and
``1,000 points of light.''

<HEAD>Sino-Soviet Friendship Shouldn't Shake Strategic Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years ago, Washington scored a diplomatic coup
by establishing ties with Communist China while Beijing's relations
with the Soviet Union were anything but cordial.
   U.S. officials say they do not expect May's planned Sino-Soviet
summit _ the first such meeting in 30 years _ to produce a similar
strategic shift in the superpower security equation.
   They say Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's bear hug in
Beijing with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping will not be a diplomatic
setback for the United States, whose commercial and academic ties
with Beijing are steadily improving.
   The Americans have ample reason to be confident.
   China has made it clear there will be no backtracking to the
1950s, when Beijing was a junior partner in Moscow's bid to lead a
unified and expanding Communist bloc.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, in a statement on summit
preparatory talks last week, stressed China's ``independent foreign
policy of peace'' and said the expected normalization of
Chinese-Soviet relations ``should not prejudice their respective
relations with other countries.''
   Gorbachev presented his appeal to end the years of mistrust
between the Communist giants in a 1986 speech that offered
compromises on territorial disputes. The Soviets later cut troops in
Soviet ally Mongolia and along the border.
   The Chinese have slowly responded to the Soviet overtures, and
they have rejected Gorbachev's proposal for an Asian-Pacific
conference on regional security, which would give Moscow more say in
regional affairs.
   Instead, the Chinese have actively sought to improve relations
with Thailand and other nations of Southeast Asia and the Southern
Pacific, partly to counter Soviet links to Vietnam and its designs
for a greater presence in the region.
   China also remains firmly committed to the West for trade, aid
and technology.
   Soviet trade with China is now 10 times the 1981 figure of $260
million, but that pales with China's $12 billion trade with the
United States last year and more than $3 billion U.S. investment in
Chinese industry.
   Japan provides more than $1 billion in loans to China annually,
and had bilateral trade worth $15.6 billion last year.
   China last year sent 445 students and scholars to the Soviet
Union. There are more than 30,000 Chinese studying in the United
States.
   Except for the brief honeymoon after the Chinese Communists came
to power in 1949, relations between Asia's two largest nations have
traditionally been shaky. Territorial disputes go back to the days
of Czarist Russia.
   After a brief border war in 1969, the Soviet ``hegemonists''
became China's No. 1 enemy, and more than 1 million troops massed on
each side of the 5,000-mile border.
   Even as the summit approaches, China continues to view the Soviet
ardor for rapprochement with suspicion and caution.
   When visiting Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze talked
effusively last week of a ``complete normalization'' of relations,
Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei balked at the word
``complete.''
   ``I don't want to use any adjectives,'' he said.
   Relations have already improved dramatically in recent years
between China and the Soviet bloc nations of Eastern Europe. China
and Mongolia have also begun to restore long-strained ties.
   Now that Moscow and Beijing are talking, they may cooperate more
in ending the 36-year stalemate on the Korean Peninsula, where they
are both allies to North Korea, and in resolving the conflict in
Cambodia, where they back opposing sides.
   The two sides have begun talks on easing military tensions along
the border.
   Although they face vastly different problems, the Soviet
purveyors of perestroika, or economic restructuring, can learn much
from China's travails of inflation and shortages after 10 years of
economic reforms.
   China, which has lagged behind in political reforms, is watching
Soviet flirtations with democracy.
   Shevardnadze spoke of greater exchanges in trade, science,
controlling the environment and exploring outer space.
   Barter trade across the border is booming, tourist exchanges have
begun and next year the second Trans-Siberian railway, a line
through western China first envisioned in the 1950s, is to be
completed.
   ``Soviet-Chinese relations have reached this point not
automatically and not by chance,'' Shevardnadze said. ``Both sides
wanted it to happen.''

<TEXT>
   The head of a U.S. group the FBI says is a
propaganda arm of the Kremlin has been charged by federal
authorities with trying to hide $17,000 he allegedly received from a
Soviet Communist Party affiliate.
   Alan Thomson, 57, executive director of the National Council of
American-Soviet Friendship, was released on a $100,000 personal
recognizance bond after arraignment in federal court in Brooklyn,
New York, before U.S. Magistrate John Caden. He did not enter a plea.
   The council has chapters in 25 states and has organized
U.S.-Soviet tours and such events as the signing of the People's
Peace Appeal at the United Nations, according to a 1987 FBI report
called ``Soviet Active Measures in the United States.''
   The one-paragraph federal indictment dealt only with the currency
charge and did not refer to the propaganda activities alleged by the
FBI.
   Active measures are a form of intelligence, including
disinformation, through which one power seeks to discredit another
or to build up its own image through covert activities.
   According to the FBI, the American-Soviet council was founded by
the Communist Party of the United States in 1943 and ``operates as a
Soviet front group which provides the Soviets with an excellent
conduit to promote its active measures campaigns, meet with U.S.
persons of influence, spot and assess U.S. persons for recruitment
operations, and influence certain groups of activists in the U.S.
peace movement.''
   Thomson, contacted by telephone at his Manhattan office, declined
to discuss the indictment or the allegations of his links with the
Soviet Communist Party.
   ``I am under federal indictment,'' said Thomson. He confirmed
that he had been arrested. ``But on the advice of counsel, I am not
going to say anything further.''
   The indictment charges Thomson with trying to evade bank
reporting requirements by having the $17,000 deposited in a Buffalo
bank in two transactions of less than $10,000 each. Deposits over
$10,000 must be reported to the government.
   Thomson was indicted by a federal grand jury in Buffalo, where he
allegedly had another person make the deposits at Goldome Federal
Savings Bank, an FBI statement said. The other person was not
identified.
   ``These funds were provided to Thomson in Moscow by a Soviet
official of the USSR Society for Friendship and Cultural Relations
with Foreign Countries,'' the statement said.
   In having two deposits made of less than $10,000 each, ``Thomson
avoided an inquiry from the bank which would have caused the bank to
report ... the source of that cash deposit,'' the FBI statement
said. It did not say when the transaction occurred.
   The charge carries a maximum penalty upon conviction of five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   A U.S. expert in Soviet active measures, Roy Godson of the
National Strategy Information Center, said the arrest was the first
he knew of concerning such Soviet activities in the United States.
   The FBI report said that the USSR Society for Friendship and
Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is controlled by the
International Department of the Central Committee of the Soviet
Communist Party. The head of the International Department is
Valentin Falin, formerly the chief of the semi-official Soviet news
agency Novosti, and one-time Soviet ambassador to West Germany.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is general secretary of the
300-member Central Committee, which maintains a large secretariat
adjacent to the Kremlin from which it runs party affairs.
   According to the FBI report on Thomson's organization, ``Soviet
direction of the NCASF is channeled through the Union of Soviet
Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign
Countries, with ultimate authority resting with the International
Department.''
   ``Soviet representatives of the (union) are in regular contact
with NCASF officials and direct the NCASF to conduct activities to
support Soviet active measures campaigns,'' according to the FBI
report.
   Soviet defectors, such as former KGB agent Stanislav Levchenko,
have testified that the Soviet friendship societies work closely
with Service A of the Soviet KGB intelligence organization in
running disinformation campaigns.
   FBI agents arrested Thomson on Tuesday morning at his Brooklyn
home. Bureau spokesman Joseph Valiquette declined to provide
details, including why Thomson would have sought to conceal the
source of the money.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the Manhattan-based council
said it was a privately funded organization that sponsors trips to
the Soviet Union by children's and trade groups and maintains a
small film and book library.
   ``We inform the public of the work of the Soviet Union,'' said
the woman, who declined to give her name. ``We're nothing but a
small organization and we don't deal with anything illegal.''
   Asked about the charges against Thomson, she said: ``I'm sure all
this stuff is going to fly by. ... It's just nonsense as usual.''

<HEAD>Federal Ethics Czar Appeals To Presidential Commission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ethics czar whose rulings would have the
force of law is needed to stiffen and standardize a welter of
federal rules, regulations and policies against conflict of
interest, according to members of a presidential commission.
   ``The ethics laws in government now are about like the Roman
Empire when Caligula was ... (using) small print in high places to
confuse the public. I'm confused,'' former Attorney General Griffin
Bell told President Bush's ethics commission at its first meeting
Tuesday.
   Bell, who is vice chairman of the eight-member panel, was among
the members who embraced the idea of establishing the ethics czar.
   ``We need a Judge Landis,'' said panel member Lloyd N. Cutler,
who was White House counsel to President Jimmy Carter. ``And one in
Congress as well.''
   Cutler referred to U.S. District Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis of
Chicago, who was named the first commissioner of major league
baseball in 1920 after members of the Chicago White Sox threw the
1919 World Series. Landis quickly assumed wide powers, including
banning some players from the game for life. His firm action was
credited with cleaning up what had become known as the Black Sox
scandal.
   No final recommendations were made at the first meeting of the
commission which has just one month to propose to Bush legislative
and administrative changes needed to improve federal ethics
enforcement.
   As the group debated which issues to address, Bell complained
that ``like the sumptuary laws in the 12th Century,'' federal ethics
rules apply differently to different people, depending on whether
they serve in Congress, the executive branch, the judiciary or the
military.
   ``Some people can do things and other people can't do the same
things,'' Bell said. ``But no one knows how to act. We should get
everyone the same rules if we can.''
   ``We need a czar,'' said the panel's chairman, former federal
appellate judge Malcolm R. Wilkey, adding that some congressmen he
has consulted with made the same suggestion.
   Wilkey said the czar ``should have the authority to enforce the
rules and to give advice that's legally binding. On the
congressional side, there ought to be a similar institution, an
independent authority outside.''
   Other members compared an ethics czar's advisory function to an
Internal Revenue Service program which issues advisory letters to
businesses and individuals who request guidance on specific tax
questions that arise in situations not clearly addressed in any tax
statute.
   Bell wondered whether the military would want its own czar and
whether the House and Senate would accept the same czar.
   But later he said, ``A czar's the only way it'll ever be solved.
We need someone like Landis, with real power and prestige. It
wouldn't work if there were too many, because it wouldn't be
prestigious enough.
   ``But if there was one, you could go and get advice that would
stand up. You could get a judge to take the post; a lot of judges
would like that job.''
   Outlining the wide review to be undertaken, Wilkey said the
commission staff is preparing a chart comparing how the executive
branch, Congress and the judiciary handle the same ethical
questions. No such document now exists in the government, he said.
   ``We're not likely to come up with any brilliant new ideas,''
Wilkey said. ``This is a well-plowed field. The problem is some of
the furrows run in different directions. Maybe we can straighten
them out.''
   During an initial discussion of restrictions on government
employees who return to private enterprise, the commissioners agreed
that some version of restrictions which now apply only in the
executive branch should be extended to Congress and the judiciary.
   They agreed to study whether a one-year ban ought to be placed on
dealings by former judges with their old court, and on dealings by
former members of Congress with the chamber in which they served.
   Morton Halperin of the American Civil Liberties Union, however,
pointed out after the meeting that the federal Office of Government
Ethics has said that existing post-employment restrictions do not
apply to the president and vice president because only the
Constitution can set the qualifications for election to federal
office.
   So, Halperin said, there might be objections to applying them to
members of Congress without amending the Constitution. One panel
member, former New Mexico Sen. Harrison H. Schmitt, agreed that was
an issue the group would have to discuss further before proceeding
with this recommendation.
   The members also expressed support for allowing scientific and
technical people more latitude to give advice in their areas of
expertise than is allowed lawyers, whose work involves cases which
are usually narrower and shorter than large military procurement
efforts.
   ``The United States will build only one new class of submarine
between now and the end of the century,'' said former Undersecretary
of the Navy R. James Woolsey. He said a sonar or submarine expert in
the government could not get a job in private enterprise without
having something to do with that.
   ``If they don't know what they can discuss in the lunch room for
two years after they leave the government, they just won't come into
the government in the first place,'' Woolsey said.

   Pop idol Michael Jackson's surprise visit
to an elementary school still scarred by a deranged gunman's
murderous rampage was so thrilling that one child couldn't even
remember her last name.
   ``It was kind of neat to see after what the school has
experienced,'' said Ron Teague, 36, who helped organize the
Cleveland Elementary School pupils for Jackson's lightning visit on
Tuesday. ``The children were just ecstatic, they treated him like a
brother.''
   ``I think they'll remember this for a long time,'' said Stockton
Unified School District spokesman John Klose.
   Jackson also dropped in at San Joaquin General Hospital, where
two youngsters were still being treated. The two were among 30
wounded on Jan. 17, when 26-year-old Patrick Edward Purdy returned
to his old elementary school and opened fire on the school yard with
an assault rifle, killing five children before committing suicide.
   At the hospital, Jackson, wearing a dark military-style jacket
with red epaulets but without his trademark glittering glove, spent
a few minutes with Vann Sa, 7, and Long Keo, 6.
   ``It was not what I would call a dialogue,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Sharon Booker. ``But five to seven minutes with Michael
Jackson _ what can you compare it to?''
   Vann Sa was listed in fair condition and was expected to remain
in the hospital for another week. Long Keo was released later in the
day.
   School officials weren't sure the visit was on until a few hours
beforehand. The hospital didn't know for sure until an hour before
Jackson arrived.
   Hundreds of people assembled outside the school on the chilly
morning, hoping for a glimpse of the superstar. But Jackson, who
arrived in a white limousine, was whisked into the school through a
back door.
   He visited classrooms where kindergarten, first, second and third
grade pupils were gathered, then stopped at an assembly of fourth
through sixth graders. No reporters or photographers were allowed to
watch as Jackson met with the children.
   ``He made a grand appearance,'' said Teague. ``All the children
were smiling.''
   ``He just smiled and that's it,'' said 6-year-old Lanisha, who
added that she was so flustered over Michael's visit she couldn't
remember her last name. Eleven-year-old Hannah Schardt, who attends
another school, came with her mother.
   ``He just made a peace sign and left right away after about five
seconds,'' she said. ``He just kind of said, `Hi' and nodded.''
   The visit came a day after City Council unanimously approved an
ordinance outlawing possession or sale of assault rifles like the
AK-47 Purdy used in his rampage. Los Angeles' City Council on
Tuesday unanimously approved a similar ban.
   Purdy, wearing combat fatigues, slipped into the schoolyard as
children were playing at midday recess and opened fire with his
semi-automatic weapon, firing more than 100 shots.
   The Stockton ordinance makes possession of assault guns a
misdemeanor and carries a $500 fine and a maximum six months' jail
sentence. It takes effect in seven days, after which any
semi-automatic weapon found in the city would be confiscated and
destroyed. Opponents said they would appeal before then.

<HEAD>Study Shows Modest Improvement From Parkinson's Disease Operation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Wednesday's 6 p.m. EST embargo has been broken. This story is
for immediate release.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental brain operation to treat
Parkinson's disease has produced moderate improvement for some
victims but not the ``miracle'' that an earlier report suggested, a
researcher said.
   ``All the patients in our group have said they felt it was
worthwhile, but in no case has it achieved what they hoped it
would,'' said Dr. Christopher G. Goetz of Rush-Presbyterian-St.
Luke's Medical Center in Chicago.
   The operation involves removing tissue from patients' adrenal
glands and transplanting it in their brains. The goal is to provide
the victims' brains with a source of dopamine, an essential
message-carrying chemical that they lack.
   The operation was first reported two years ago by Dr. Ignacio
Madrazo and colleagues at the National Autonomous University of
Mexico and the social security hospital system in Mexico City. They
reported dramatic improvement in two patients. Since then, surgeons
at many medical centers have tried to duplicate their results.
   ``What came out originally was the sense that this was a
miracle,'' said Goetz. ``This is no miracle.''
   His report combined the results of surgery on 19 patients at his
hospital and at the University of South Florida and the University
of Kansas. The results were being published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   Parkinson's disease results from destruction of a part of the
brain called the nigral tissue, which makes dopamine. The adrenal
glands, which lie above the kidneys, also produce the substance.
   The disease afflicts between 500,000 and 1 million Americans,
including 2 percent of people over age 70. Victims often suffer
tremors and have trouble controlling their movements.
   Drugs can control the disease, but as the illness worsens, the
medicines lose their effectiveness and often don't work for hours at
a time.
   Before the surgery, the patients' drugs worked about half the
time. Afterward, this increased to three-quarters of the time.
   While the drugs are working, the patients are able to move about
and care for themselves with little assistance, although they still
clearly show the effects of the disease. When the drugs are not
effective, the patients usually need wheelchairs.
   ``Despite cautious optimism, we conclude that the widespread use
of this procedure outside of research centers is premature,'' the
researchers wrote.

   The featured guest at the government-run
Institute of Building Techniques apologized to the crowd for his
fancy blue suit.
   ``I wanted to say I'm not that elegant. I also work hard, I'm
just a worker,'' Lech Walesa told the roughly 500 people in the
audience.
   The 45-year-old shipyard electrician who chairs the banned
Solidarity free trade union movement won a round of applause Tuesday
when introduced by institute director Marian Weglarz.
   ``I want to welcome the great Pole, the laureate of the Nobel
Peace Prize, Mr. Lech Walesa. It is a great honor that Mr. Walesa
bothered to come to us the day after the session of the round table.
Long live Walesa,'' said Weglarz.
   Walesa is leading the opposition delegation in historic
``round-table'' talks with Communist authorities that began Monday
and seeks the social accord needed to tackle Poland's daunting
economic crisis.
   ``We are witnesses to historic moments that will remain in our
memory until the end of our lives. Long live Lech Walesa,'' Weglarz
added.
   Since Solidarity was crushed in a December 1981 military
crackdown and banned the next year, Walesa has rarely been allowed
to address workers legally on state property.
   But Walesa held a lively hour-long question-and-answer session
with his constituents _ the rank-and-file for whom he is trying to
gain restoration of Solidarity's legal status in the round-table
talks.
   The rally was a reminder of the days during Solidarity's 16-month
legal existence when Walesa traveled the country, captivating
audiences with straightforward speeches explaining the need for free
trade unions.
   Walesa responded to Weglarz's introduction with some easy-going
banter.
   ``I'm surprised. I have stage fright and I don't know what to
answer. Mr. Director, let me speak, you are talking too much,'' he
said.
   The crowd laughed.
   The Solidarity chairman seemed aware that to some, it might
appear a different Walesa was behind the podium, and he apologized
for his fancy suit. He is more frequently seen in drab polyester.
   He explained: ``I came here straight from the embassy, where I
said goodbye to the Swiss foreign minister and I came here straight
to you.''
   Then, speaking from a platform draped with a large Solidarity
banner, he explained why he feels compelled to negotiate with the
same authorities that crushed his movement and are widely distrusted
by much of the populace.
   ``I'm doing everything to take advantage of all chances to build
agreement, to build a better Poland. I think I won't let anybody
cheat me. I think you will not let anybody cheat you,'' he said.
   ``I don't believe in the round table, but I do believe in you and
in structures. Lech Walesa and company are making it possible so
that you can get organized, so that you can choose structures and
organizations to solve Polish problems with them,'' he said.
   Above all, Walesa counseled patience in Poland, which is wracked
by a $39 billion foreign debt, 60 percent inflation, chronic
consumer shortages and rising worker dissatisfaction.
   The government first proposed the round-table talks in August
during the country's worst labor unrest since Solidarity's heyday.
   Walesa branded as ``great political stupidity'' a call for a
second Solidarity congress by Andrzej Gwiazda, a former rival for
leadership of the union who has criticized him for refusing to hold
another national convention.
   ``The congress would show many weaknesses (within Solidarity) and
we don't need it right now,'' Walesa said.
   The audience peppered him with questions, asking him what
Solidarity means, how will it be organized and whether he trusts the
authorities.
   ``Solidarity means first of all reform ... It is a fundamental
problem today that we should get organized as a trade union,''
Walesa said.
   He warned the crowd to above all remain peaceful.
   ``If the Polish peaceful evolution doesn't win, there will be a
revolution in this country and splinters may fall down far away ...
So if you want to live in security, it's in your interest to allow
the Polish evolution to develop peacefully and it will be profitable
for all.
   ``We must remember that seven years have been wasted. We must
save the national tissue, we must stop youth from escaping from
Poland. No one will make order in Poland for us. It is our Poland,''
he said.
   ``It's beautiful to hear him again,'' one woman in the crowd said.

   Share prices rose further to end Wednesday's session
at yet another trading high on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the
U.S. dollar showed no change against the Japanese yen from the
previous closing.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which surpassed
the 32,000-point level for the first time in Wednesday's morning
session, rose further in the afternoon to gain 184.47 points, or
0.58 percent, and finish at record high of 32,065.12.
   The dollar closed at 129.50 yen, unchanged from both its opening
level and its finish on Tuesday. The currency moved in a narrow
range of 129.40-129.53 yen during the day's dealings.
   Trading in the U.S. currency will remain in a narrow range ahead
of President Bush's budget address before Congress, scheduled for
Thursday night, dealers said.
   ``The dollar-yen rate hardly moved because the investors were
equally selling and buying the U.S. money for speculative reasons,''
said Chemical Bank's Ichiro Ikeda.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei opened sharply higher after
rises on overseas markets overnight, stock dealers said.
   ``Individual and foreign investors' strong buying interest has
contributed to the recent rise in the Nikkei,'' said a dealer with
Nomura Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Recent stability in the currency market has prompted investors to
buy, he said.
   Prices on the exchange rise naturally because demand for stocks
exceeds supply. But the recent surge in prices could make investors
nervous, the dealer said.

<TEXT>
   Mississippi let a debt of more than $10
billion build up during the past 148 years, but the state treasurer
says he has an idea that could turn all the red ink into a gold mine
for college students.
   Back in 1841, Mississippi defaulted on $7 million in bonds issued
to purchase stock in two state-created banks. While that antebellum
debt was ballooning to more than $10 billion, state officials fended
off repeated efforts by the British bondholders to get repaid.
   Now, a London collection agency finally has given up the quest.
And state Treasurer Marshall Bennett has cooked up a plan for the
state to profit off the deal by selling the bonds as antiques.
   ``They've been an obscure part of Mississippi's history that has
sort of been stored away in a vault,'' Bennett said, outlining the
events that led to his proposal to fund scholarships with proceeds
from the bonds.
   Bennett said the seed for his idea was planted two weeks after he
took office in January 1988, when the director of the Council of the
Corporation of Foreign Bondholders called him from London seeking
payment on many of the old bond certificates.
   The debt collection agency had been hounding Mississippi
treasurers ever since its founding in 1868. Most of the old
Mississippi bonds are held by British investors.
   But Bennett repeated that Mississippi wouldn't pay a penny on the
bonds. He had no choice _ an article in the 1890 Mississippi
Constitution specifically prohibited repayment.
   Last week, the bondholders' organization announced that it was
going into liquidation.
   ``We are withdrawing from the fray and we shan't be pursuing the
matter any longer,'' Council Manager Eric French said in a telephone
interview from London.
   In recent years, the only debts remaining on the council's books
involved East Germany and Mississippi, French said. It didn't appear
likely that either would ever pay off their debts.
   French said it is theoretically possible individual bondholders
might continue trying to get their money from Mississippi, but he
wasn't aware of any such plans.
   Bennett, meanwhile, explained that a small portion of the old
bonds fell into the state's hands years ago. The bonds will never be
redeemed, but he said the state could sell them to antique bond
collectors.
   He said $450,000 worth of the $7 million in bonds _ 450 documents
with a face value of $1,000 each _ were donated in 1914 to
Mississippi's institutions of higher learning by the Peabody Trust
Fund, established by the late Massachusetts philanthropist George
Peabody. The Mississippi treasurer holds the bonds in trust.
   Bennett said most state College Board members and legislators
over the years were never aware of the bonds. But he said he has had
inquiries about them from a few auction and bond brokerage houses in
New York and London.
   He said the state should retain some of the bonds for historical
purposes, but he hopes the others will be sold, possibly for as much
as $500 each.
   A broker for a New York auction house agreed that the old bonds
could be marketed.
   ``We want them for collectors. It's like anything else people
collect _ postage stamps, famous signatures _ it just appeals to a
certain group of collectors,'' said Diana Herzog of R.M. Smythe &amp;
Co., which specializes in the research, appraisal and auction of
antique documents.
   She said interest in collecting antique bonds has increased
greatly during recent years, and the fact that the Mississippi bonds
were repudiated may even add to their value.
   ``They have a history to them, and there's a story there,'' she
said. ``The story mirrors historical events.''

   President Bush says he still wants some sort of
pay raise for Congress, judges and top federal officials, even
though he signed the death warrant for a 51 percent increase he
initially endorsed.
   Bush was ``inviting suggestions'' for future raise proposals at a
meeting with Republican senators Tuesday, according to Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska.
   And in a White House statement released after he signed the
resolution defeating the raise, Bush said: ``I believe that some
level of pay increase is in order, and I will be working with the
House and Senate leadership to develop proposals to achieve that
end. I would also like to express my special concern about the level
of compensation for members of our federal judiciary.''
   The House voted 380-48 Tuesday, and the Senate followed suit,
94-6, in passing legislation to reject a pay raise plan for
lawmakers, top bureaucrats and members of the federal bench.
   Bush signed the measure several hours before the midnight
deadline that would have allowed the raises to become law, including
a boost in congressional salary from $89,500 to $135,000.
   The pay issue got the 101st Congress off to a rocky start as
public scorn was heaped upon lawmakers _ who were presented with a
pay package recommended by a presidential commission, and endorsed
by former President Reagan and Bush.
   By day's end Tuesday many lawmakers appeared drained, but at
least one still had a sense of humor.
   ``I wish I was as thin as my wallet,'' said Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., in recognition of her being on the plump side.
   House members especially faced an outraged public, because the
Democratic leadership _ without protest from Republican leaders _
had planned to let the raise become law without a vote.
   Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, tried to accommodate them with a
strategy to let the full raise become law Wednesday and schedule a
vote Thursday to scale it back to 30 percent.
   The plan collapsed, and Wright scheduled Tuesday's rejection
vote, after anti-raise lawmakers won a procedural vote Monday that
showed they had the strength to win.
   The Senate handled the problem differently, voting 95-5 last week
to reject the raise at a time it appeared the House would let the
increase become law without a vote.
   While some House members called the Senate vote hypocritical, it
put the senators on record against the raise. They had little choice
but to repeat the sentiment Tuesday when they voted again in order
to conform to the House language.
   Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who had voted against the raise the
first time, supported it Tuesday.
   Jeffords said he cast his vote Tuesday in part to make clear his
view that judges are badly in need of a pay raise.
   The other senators voting to sustain the raise were Democrats
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and
Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii; and Republicans Stevens and Frank
Murkowski of Alaska.
   During House debate, several lawmakers focused not on themselves,
but on warnings that defeat of the raise proposal would accelerate
an exodus of jurists and top managers from government service.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist weighed in too, commenting:
``I deeply regret the congressional action, which has prevented the
federal judges in this country from receiving a well-deserved pay
raise. ... We will not be able to attract and retain the kind of
judges we need ... unless we pay our judges fairly and equitably.''
   ``This issue isn't over,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, a leading
opponent of the pay raise who said the Congress must deal this year
with pay for judges and bureaucrats as well as the questions
involved in honoraria and other forms of outside income for
lawmakers.
   The votes left unresolved whether Congress still wants to reform
the honoraria system, which allows lawmakers to accept speaking fees
and travel expenses from special interests.
   The Senate last week voted unanimously to ban acceptance of fees,
but made the resolution contingent on the pay raise becoming law.
   Bipartisan negotiators in the House had agreed to a package to
ban such fees, in addition to closing a loophole that allowed House
members in office prior to 1980 to convert unused campaign cash to
personal use.
   The debate in the two houses Tuesday was as different as the way
each chamber handled the pay issue.
   Senate debate was as emotionless as the House debate was
emotional.
   The most revealing moment came when the powerful chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, rose
to speak.
   He reminded members that congressional perks ``can't make up for
the birthdays, ballgames, holidays and meals that we miss.''
   He asked: ``When was the last time you skipped a town meeting for
a school play? If you can't remember, ask your spouse. You maintain
two households, but you're never home.''
   Rostenkowski received a rousing round of applause, but only
moments later, many of the same House members voted to reject the
raise.

<HEAD>Bennett Makes No Promises on Drug-Fighting Money to Cities</HEAD>

   Mayors from cities across the nation, anxious
to discover whether the Bush administration will help them fight the
drug war on the city streets, got an encouraging sign but no
promises from drug czar-designate William J. Bennett.
   ``This is serious business,'' Bennett told the U.S. Conference of
Mayors on Tuesday. ``This is the business of state and local
governments. But it is emphatically the business of the federal
government.''
   But Bennett, nominated by President Bush to become the nation's
first director of National Drug Control Policy, didn't say how that
business would translate into dollars for the local governments.
   The mayors are extremely concerned about funding because while
the drug bill called for $275 million to be spent in the current
fiscal year for Justice Assistance programs _ grants to state and
local agencies _ only $220 million has been appropriated by Congress.
   And no money at all was included for those programs in President
Reagan's budget proposal for fiscal 1990. In that year, the drug
bill called for $350 million to be spent on those programs. Bush is
expected to reveal his budget proposals for fiscal 1990 later this
week.
   San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, noting that her city suffered
96 drive-by shooting incidents last year, called for federal funds
to be funneled directly to the local governments, a suggestion
loudly applauded by her colleagues.
   ``The problem with some of the federal money in the past is that
it had to go through so many hands before it go to the streets, and
by the time it gets to the streets, it's too late,'' O'Connor said.
   Addressing her remarks to Bennett, she said, ``If there's some
way that you could organize a program ... to go from the federal
government right to the local entity to help solve the problem, you
will have done more for the war on drugs than anything I can think
of.''
   Bennett told reporters after the conference that his budget
decisions would have to await completion of the national drug
control strategy report, which is due 180 days after he is confirmed
by the Senate. His hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee
are scheduled to begin March 1.
   ``Certainly some of the effort is going to take money,'' he said.
``You're going to see some progrss and some movement on this issue
very soon. The six-month report is the critical document to me.''
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, predicted that Congress would fully fund the
drug bill for the current year, approving legislation already
introduced in both houses to add $1.6 billion to spending.
   While those bills do not specify how to pay for that spending,
Biden said it could be provided by raising taxes on cigarettes, beer
and liquor.
   ``We're still 60 percent behind what the tax was in 1954 on those
commodities,'' he said. ``If you have a better idea, suggest it, or
stop saying you support the drug bill.''
   Bennett said he will pay attention to the law enforcement end of
the drug war and is considering a bigger role for the military, but
he wouldn't disclose what role that might be.
   Joking about the controversy over Bush's decision to leave him
out of the Cabinet, Bennett told the mayors, ``I have a meeting with
the president tomorrow, one on one. As a bonus on Thursday, I'm
going to a Cabinet meeting. ... I always prefer a one-on-one
tutorial to a seminar.''

<HEAD>Feds Taking Control of All Insolvent S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials trying to contain the
multibillion-dollar cost of the savings and loan bailout are
mobilizing more than 1,200 regulators to take control of all
remaining insolvent S&amp;Ls over the next few weeks.
   The massive government takeover was announced Tuesday as
financial regulators scrambled to implement the first portions of
President Bush's S&amp;L overhaul package.
   Meanwhile, the Bush proposals were receiving initial favorable
reactions from Congress although some lawmakers said they had
reservations about some aspects of the proposals, in particular the
$40 billion estimated cost to taxpayers.
   Officials of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
insures deposits at S&amp;Ls, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which performs the same function at banks, predicted that within a
month they would have joint regulatory teams in place at
approximately 224 insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   The government takeover will transfer control of the S&amp;Ls to the
federal regulators, who will oversee policy decisions made by local
managers of the insolvent institutions.
   In most cases government regulators will keep the insolvent
institutions open until Congress funds a rescue package. At that
time, the institutions are to be sold with government assistance to
new investors.
   These institutions have been allowed to stay open even though
they were losing billions of dollars annually because regulators did
not have the money to close them down.
   The Bush proposal, in addition to revamping the government
regulatory structure, proposes raising $90 billion to bail out
insolvent institutions through a combination of $40 billion in tax
dollars and higher insurance premiums paid by banks and S&amp;Ls.
   Both Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich.,
and House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
pledged on Tuesday that their committees would move quickly to vote
on the Bush plan.
   ``When we are losing on the order of $33 million a day (from S&amp;L
operating losses), all of us are under enormous responsibilities to
get this package done,'' Riegle said.
   Gonzalez predicted his panel could vote on the proposal by the
first week in March.
   The government takeover of insolvent S&amp;Ls had been urged last
week by the General Accounting Office, which said the sick S&amp;Ls were
offering high interest rates to attract deposits, thus driving up
costs for the healthy part of the industry and increasing the
ultimate bailout cost to the government.
   Four insolvent S&amp;Ls in Maryland, Texas, California and Florida
were taken over by the regulatory teams on Tuesday with officials
saying they were working off a priority list targeting the largest
insolvent S&amp;Ls with the biggest rate of losses first.
   The announcement of the takeovers, coming just one day after Bush
unveiled his plan to deal with the S&amp;L crisis, reflected the impact
the president's proposals were already having.
   Officials said they planned to mobilize between 1,200 and 1,500
regulators from four different federal agencies to handle the
takeover job in coming weeks.
   Bush has called on Congress to abolish the FSLIC as a separate
insurance agency and have its functions taken over by the bank
insurance agency, the FDIC.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said he had sent out letters to
all employees of the beleaugered FSLIC fund assuring them of
employment with his agency.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
which currently runs the FSLIC fund, said that the two agencies were
working in ``full cooperation and harmony.''
   Wall said he supported Bush's proposals, which include abolishing
the three-member bank board and putting Wall and the bank board
regulatory apparatus under the supervision of the Treasury
Department.
   While this transfer and the actual takeover of the FSLIC by the
FDIC would require congressional approval, the joint supervisory
effort did not need congressional authorization.
   Regulators from the two insurance funds said they were also
receiving assistance from bank auditors with the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve.
   The four institutions the government took control of on Tuesday
were Baltimore Federal Financial of Maryland; Freedom Savings and
Loan Association of Tampa, Fla.; Pacific Savings Bank of Costa Mesa,
Calif., and Gill Savings Association of Hondo, Texas.
   Two of the institutions, Freedom and Gill, were already under
government control in a supervisory program run by S&amp;L regulators.
Under the new initiative, the S&amp;L regulators will be joined by
regulators from the FDIC.
   Seidman said the government regulators will try to minimize
operating losses, eliminate speculative lending practices and ferret
out any continuing examples of insider abuse and fraud.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Senate Finance Committee are
reviewing the financial file on Cabinet nominee Louis Sullivan along
with assurances from government ethics officials that he will have
no conflicts of interest.
   Sullivan, President Bush's nominee to head the Department of
Health and Human Services, has agreed to sell some of his financial
holdings and recuse himself on matters that involve his medical
school, according to an HHS ethics official.
   The actions will ``avoid the potential for any conflicts of
interests or appearance'' of a conflict, Darrel J. Grinstead, HHS
ethics official, said in a letter to Frank Q. Nebeker, director of
the Office of Government Ethics.
   Copies of the letter were sent to Finance Committee members along
with copies of Sullivan's financial disclosure form, the ethics
office said.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, said he
wanted ``to move as expeditiously as possible'' on Sullivan's
confirmation hearing, but congressional sources who spoke on the
condition of anonymity said the hearing probably won't be held for
at least two weeks.
   Though initial review of the ethics report raised few questions
among committee members, lawmakers say they want time for a close
review of the nominee's financial disclosure report, and Congress is
scheduled to be in recess next week.
   ``This man looks excellent on paper to us,'' said a congressional
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But, the source
added, ``we don't want to have any corners on this tent that aren't
nailed down.''
   Sullivan's confirmation, originally scheduled for last week, was
postponed by lingering questions over Sullivan's financial situation
and his FBI background check.
   The nominee put to rest the major concerns raised about his ties
to the Morehouse School of Medicine when he said he would resign as
president, forgo nearly $300,000 in severance pay and take an unpaid
leave of absence as a professor of medicine.
   An FBI background check focused in part on his connection to a
Georgia politician convicted of extortion who, unrelated to the
extortion case, was paid as a part-time lecturer by Morehouse while
he used his seat on the county commission to support issues that
benefited the school.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday the
background investigation had been completed and found ``no adverse
information as far as we know.''
   Grinstead's letter said Sullivan agreed to divest himself of
holdings in three companies to avoid any potential conflicts of
interest.
   The holdings he will divest are valued at between $7,000 and
$25,000 in a total portfolio worth between $633,000 and $1.17
million or more. His largest holdings are in pension plans, valued
at between $450,000 and $750,000 or more. His liabilities are listed
at between $40,000 and $115,000.
   While on leave, Sullivan will not be paid by Morehouse, but will
continue to participate in the school's employee benefit plans,
including health and life insurance, disability insurance and the
school's retirement plan, according to Grinstead's letter.
   The letter also says that because of his continued tie to
Morehouse, Sullivan would recuse himself from participating as HHS
secretary in matters such as grants, contracts, litigation,
investigations and enforcement actions specifically involving the
school.
   The White House, however, has agreed to allow Sullivan to
participate in general policy matters ``such as regulations and
legislation that would affect Morehouse only to the same extent that
similarly situated institutions would be affected,'' Grinstead said
in the letter.
   Finance Committee members want more information about ``others
who have maintained their ties with academic institutions'' after
taking a federal government job, the congressional source said.
``We're looking for examples in which this kind of situation has
occurred before.''

   The 51 percent pay raise that Congress wound up rejecting
dominated the airwaves around the country, with switchboards at some
talk-radio stations lighting up nearly once a minute and practically
every caller was against it.
   ``Since the election, it's been the best issue as far as stirring
people up,'' talk-show host Roger Gray of KPRC in Houston said
Tuesday.
   ``And it's almost unanimously negative. I think today we got one
caller in support. But callers like that are in the distinct
minority.''
   Responding to the outcry against the proposed pay hike, Congress
voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to reject it, then rushed the
legislation to President Bush, who signed it hours before a midnight
deadline.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, a pay raise defender, chided House colleagues for
not having ``the courage to speak out'' in their own defense. ``We
became cartoon cannon fodder for trash television and talk radio,''
the California Democrat complained.
   ``This wasn't artificially created,'' said talk-radio host Mike
Siegel of station KING in Seattle, who ran his show from Washington,
D.C., last week and testified before a Senate committee on the pay
raise. ``The lines were flooded every day.''
   Siegel urged listeners to write and call representatives to
express opposition to the proposal, and was part of a network of
stations nationwide that suggested sending lawmakers tea bags
symbolic of the Boston Tea Party.
   ``Everybody's thrilled'' by Tuesday's vote, said Cindy Slay,
producer of the Jim Eason talk show at KGO in San Francisco. ``I get
maybe one call out of 50 who say they were for the pay raise.''
   Slay said the show, which is on weekdays from 2-4 p.m., received
about 50 calls per hour, or nearly one a minute, on the issue.
   Several callers to KGO thanked talk-show hosts and activists such
as Ralph Nader for drawing attention to the issue, Slay said.
   ``The credit should go to the outraged citizenry who mailed in
tea bags and truckloads of letters and who complained and made phone
calls,'' said Eason.
   In Baltimore, WBAL talk-show host Ron Smith said, ``People were
just very gratified, amazed and delighted that they made this effort
against the odds and that they actually achieved something.''
   He said 80 to 90 percent of his callers expressed outrage at the
pay raise's size, its timing and the original plan for it to have
taken effect automatically.
   In Washington, callers to WWRC expressed happiness that the pay
raise had been turned down, said producer Lori Madock,
   ``Our lines are going crazy,'' she said, noting that the
station's nine telephone lines had been receiving about 25 calls an
hour.
   ``This congressional pay raise is a joke,'' said a caller
identifying himself as Jim of Herndon, Va. ``Look at the mess
they've made of things.''
   But Rita in Bethesda, Md., said she thought the raise should have
been approved. ``These people (who oppose the raise) seem to think
that's a tremendous amount of money and it isn't,'' she said.
   In Phoenix, KTAR News Director Preston Westmoreland said so many
callers opposed the plan because ``people feel that with the
economic troubles of today and the budget deficit that you just have
no business giving yourself a 50 percent pay raise.''
   Of the dozen people who called Pittsburgh's KDKA on Tuesday,
``the overriding message now that it's done is `Let's find out who
supported it and vote them out of office,''' said producer Greg Jena.
   Among those taking heavy fire were House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, who initially had planned to let the increase take effect
automatically today without a House vote.
   ``I'm very disgusted in Jim Wright,'' said one caller to KLIF-AM
in Fort Worth, which Wright represents. ``I'm going to work as hard
as I can to get him out of office.''

<HEAD>Former Congressman Who Suffers From Lyme Disease Urges Research,
Education</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Berkley W. Bedell returned to
Congress to seek funding for research and education on Lyme disease,
the tick-borne disease that forced him out of office.
   The Iowa Democrat, who served in the House for 12 years, said
Tuesday public education is badly needed to fight the disease, which
activists said is second only to AIDS as the most widespread new
infectious disease of the 1980s.
   Bedell, who left office in 1987, said he supports new legislation
by Reps. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., and Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.,
to provide $2.5 million annually for three years for research and
treatment grants and another $1 million a year for education.
   Bedell, 67, said he has an irregular heartbeat, suffers from
arthritis, experiences loss of memory and tires easily due to the
affliction. But he said his condition was diagnosed quickly and
treated. Others often do not realize they have the disease until it
becomes more debilitating.

<NOTE>Consumer Debt Grew By $5.4 Billion in December</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans borrowed $5.4 billion more than they
repaid in December, the government reports.
   The December borrowing raised the consumer debt at an annual rate
of 9.9 percent, the Federal Reserve Board said Tuesday. The consumer
debt rose $4.7 billion in November and increased $3.9 billion in
October.
   The seasonally adjusted annual rate of credit growth was 8.5
percent in November and 7.2 percent in October.
   December's increase matched the 9.9 percent rise recorded last
August, which was the highest since a 15.2 percent increase in June.
   The December jump was paced by an increase in outstanding auto
loans, while growth in the category of debt that includes credit
cards slowed from the rapid pace of the preceding two months.
   Consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of economic
health because it accounts for two-thirds of the gross national
product.

<NOTE>World Bank Loans to Hit Record $21 Billion</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New loans by the World Bank, biggest source of
aid to the Third World, will reach a record $21 billion in the year
ending June 30, bank officials predict.
   Ernest Stern, vice president for finance, estimated Tuesday that
$16 billion would go to the somewhat more prosperous countries which
still need easy loans to raise their living standards. They pay
interest at a variable rate, now 7.65 percent a year.
   Sheldon Rappaport, the bank's financial spokesman, said over $5.5
billion will go to the poorest countries from the bank's
International Development Association. It makes loans at less than 1
percent interest.
   New loans in the previous year totaled $19.2 billion.

<HEAD>Baby Gulls Dying From Antarctic Oil Slick</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chilean frogmen worked to stop oil from
leaking from a partially submerged ship off Antarctica, authorities
said, and a report today said thousands of polar seabirds have
already died near the spreading slick.
   Crewmen from the Chilean cutter Yelcho on Tuesday encircled the
nearly sunken Argentina vessel Bahia Paraiso with floating booms
designed to contain any further leakage, said a navy communique
released in Santiago.
   New Zealand Press Association today reported that thousands of
baby Polar Skua gulls had died because their parents were unable to
find food.
   The predatory birds also can freeze to death if the oil disrupts
their natural insulation or be poisoned if they swallow oil while
preening themselves or eat contaminated prey.
   The news agency, citing unidentified scientists at the nearby
U.S. Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula, said the oil slick
has surrounded penguin rookeries near the wrecked ship.
   An operator reached by telephone at the research station referred
all inquiries to the Washington-based National Science Foundation,
which oversees the base 590 miles from the tip of South America.
   The Argentine research and supply ship grounded on shoals Jan. 28.
   The ship holds about 800 tons of fuel, including diesel oil in
bulk and aviation fuel in steel drums. The National Science
Foundation says oil is leaking slowly from the ship, which gradually
sank in the shallow waters. Only a section of its superstructure
remains above the surface.
   Foundation officials said Tuesday that a slick nearly 500 feet
wide and two miles long was trailing away from the vessel toward the
south, threatening the frozen continent's fragile and unspoiled
environment. Today's New Zealand report said the slick was four
miles long. It did not mention width.
   A U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, was expected to join
cleanup efforts. It carries military and civilian experts and 52
tons of sophisticated equipment.
   A research vessel of the Chilean Antarctic Institute also was at
the spill site evaluating environmental damage, said the insitute's
director, Antonio Massei.
   In a telephone interview in Santiago, he said the area around the
accident is home to 29,000 penguins. Scientists say many baby
penguins soon will take their first swim in the waters, and they are
worried the youngsters could suffocate in the oil.
   Other wildlife also is threatened, including krill, a tiny
shrimp-like crustacean considered a vital link in Antarctica's food
chain.
   U.S. researchers say a number of seals were seen covered with oil
and moving slowly in the waters.
   Both the Yelcho and the Polar Duke left Friday from the Chilean
port of Punta Arenas, a major supply point for Antarctic operations.
   Two Argentine vessels were in the area of the spill and planned
to help, according to the Chilean navy. However, the ships were
awaiting equipment being flown from Argentina to a Chilean-run base
200 miles from the wreckage.

<HEAD>Stocks Rise; Dollar Unchanged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index, setting a
new high for the fourth consecutive day, passed the 32,000-point
level for the first time today, while the dollar closed unchanged
from the previous day's close.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 184.47 points, or 0.58
percent, closing at 32,065.12. Its previous record closing, set
Tuesday, was 31,880.65.
   The index rose sharply shortly after the market opened, and
stayed higher, following gains on overseas markets overnight,
dealers said.
   A Nomura Securities dealer said individual and foreign investors'
strong buying interest has contributed to the Nikkei's recent rise.
Foreign investors bought issues worth an estimated $4.2 billion in
January, he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   With demand for stocks exceeding supply, unless more new issues
are listed on the exchange, the Nikkei's trend will continue, he
said.
   But the recent surge in prices would make investors nervous, and
some institutional investors already have begun to sell issues to
take profits because they feel insecure holding such high-priced
issues for a long period, the dealer added.
   In active trading, with first section volume estimated at 1.7
billion shares, steel and shipbuilding shares were among the gainers.
   In currency dealings, the dollar opened at 129.50 yen, unchanged
from Tuesday's close, and finished at the same level. It traded in a
tight range of 129.40-129.53 yen.
   A continued narrow range was expected ahead of President Bush's
budget speech to Congress, scheduled for Thursday night, dealers
said.
   ``The dollar-yen rate hardly moved because investors were equally
selling and buying the U.S. currency for speculative reasons,'' said
Chemical Bank's Ichiro Ikeda.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a news
conference today that some representatives of seven leading
industrial nations, meeting in Washington last Friday, expressed
concern about the high levels of the dollar against the West German
mark.
   He said intervention by Japan's central bank in defense of the
West German mark is included in policy of the ``Group of Seven'' as
``a matter of course.''

   Jackie Thomas desperately wishes someone
could tell her how to cope with the rare disease that forces her
4-year-old daughter to live life away from sunlight, her facial skin
to be replaced by surgery.
   Every time Wendy Thomas goes outside, she must wear a large
sunbonnet and special sunglasses that protect her delicate eyes. If
she doesn't, she runs the risk of developing more of the skin
cancers that already have marred her ever-smiling face and threaten
her life.
   Unless it is night, she must travel only in her family's van,
which is equipped with window blinds and tints. Even in the house,
she must be careful to play on the side away from what rays get past
the blinds and shades, and she must be covered every day with the
most powerful sun blocker manufactured.
   As Wendy prepared to undergo more surgery Thursday in Dallas, her
32-year-old mother said she can only wish there was a support group
in Texas for mothers of children with xeroderma pigmentosum. She
would even start one if she could find someone to join.
   ``I wish somebody could tell me what Wendy is going to go
through, especially in the last and final stages,'' she said. ``But
I can't find anybody.''
   Only a couple hundred Americans have the usually fatal disease.
The odds of having XP, as the affliction is known, are literally
one-in-a-million, says its foremost expert, Dr. Kenneth Kraemer, a
research scientist at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.
   Those with XP must be constantly protected from sunlight,
otherwise their skin and eyes may be severely damaged.
   But the real risk for Wendy comes from the numerous skin cancers
that form on XP patients, some of which could prove fatal if not
treated in time. Also, about 20 percent of XP patients have
nerve-related problems and may develop deafness, muscular disorders
or retardation.
   Wendy has had so many skin cancers removed from her fair,
freckled skin during seven previous surgeries that her parents have
agreed to allow a plastic surgeon to replace all the skin on her
face.
   At present, her face is scar-covered and her scalp is hairless in
several patches. The girl's parents say they know the extensive skin
grafting is risky, but say it is her only chance for a fresh start _
and survival. Otherwise, she faces a risk of melanoma, the most
severe form of skin cancer.
   The surgeon, Dr. H. Steve Byrd, would rather not talk about how
risky the surgery is, his secretary said.
   The difficult and painful surgery will take place at Dallas'
Baylor University Medical Center, where Wendy will have an extender
inserted into her abdomen so skin can be stretched and later removed
to be grafted onto her face, Mrs. Thomas said.
   ``I wish she was old enough to make some of these decisions on
her own,'' Mrs. Thomas said. ``She's gone through so much pain
already.''
   Some of the pain isn't merely physical, and that is just becoming
evident to the child.
   Even in Athens, where several fund-raisers have been held to help
the Thomases with medical bills, some women will pull their children
away from Wendy, fearful her disease may be contagious, said Mrs.
Thomas, who lost her a factory job recently and whose husband is a
farmer.
   It is not, said Kraemer, who has produced the only laymen's guide
to the disease. And a lucky few, who were diagnosed early in life,
have lived relatively normal lives, he said.
   Mrs. Thomas said she can only sit and wonder how effective
previous surgeries have been in removing all the skin cancers.
   ``Quite frankly, for a long time, I'd just sit in my house and
cry,'' she said. ``I used to blame myself for Wendy's problems. I
used to love sitting out in the sun and Wendy would always be with
me.''
   Mrs. Thomas, and her husband, Ronnie, didn't identify Wendy's
problem was until she was 2, when she suddenly turned bright red in
what seemed to be an untreatable sunburn. And the first doctor that
did know what was wrong gave them no encouragement. The Thomases had
asked how XP would affect Wendy's schooling.
   ``He said, `You won't have to worry about that, she won't be
around that long,''' Mrs. Thomas said.
   The Thomases, who live with their three children in this town of
10,000 residents 60 miles southeast of Dallas, refuse to let their
faith waver. They say they must be willing to take desperate
measures because they desperately love Wendy. And no matter what
cost they must meet, it will gladly be paid.
   ``And I'm different,'' said Mrs. Thomas. ``Someday when another
mother needs me, when someone needs to know what it's like going
through the last and final stages, I'm going to tell them.''

   Bribery charges against the Navajo nation's
chairman have fueled demands for his resignation, but he says he's
been targeted by Washington as ``a modern-day Geronimo'' because of
his work for Indian rights.
   Chairman Peter MacDonald Sr. also told members of the nation's
largest tribe that it was an Indian practice for a leader to accept
gifts while doing business, according to a speech released by his
staff.
   ``These kinds of acts of appreciation are a part of Navajo
culture,'' Ferlin Clark, an assistant press aide, quoted MacDonald
on Monday.
   MacDonald _ whose tribe numbers about 200,000 and lives in
Arizona, New Mexico and Utah _ has declined to talk with reporters
about a U.S. Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigation
into claims of contractor kickbacks and of his profiting from the
purchase of a ranch.
   John Chapela, a former Navajo Housing Administration director
leading a recall drive against MacDonald, said Tuesday the
60-year-old chairman is using his influence over the Navajo
newspaper and radio station to portray the hearings to his people
``as an attack on the Navajo nation, the Navajo people and their
tribal sovereignty.''
   Chapela said MacDonald was corrupt and has entrenched himself at
the expense of his people.
   Clark told The Arizona Republic newspaper that MacDonald assured
listeners he broke no rules in his weekend speech to the Chichiltah
Chapter in New Mexico.
   ``While these contractors gave gifts as appreciation, I want to
explain to you that they were required to follow the rules and
regulations of the Navajo tribe,'' MacDonald said, according to
Clark's translation of the Navajo text.
   MacDonald also said Senate investigators compared him with
Geronimo, the Apache medicine man who remained on the warpath until
the early 1900s.
   ``They refer to me as a modern-day Geronimo,'' he said.
   Chapela said it would be a minor step to get the 36,000
signatures needed to force a recall election compared to the
difficulty of getting the signatures certified by the Navajo
Election Commission and persuading two-thirds of the tribe's
88-member council to approve a recall vote, as required.
   MacDonald hand-picked the election administrator and controls the
votes of more than 30 council members, Chapela said in a telephone
interview from his law office in Window Rock, 300 miles northeast of
Phoenix.
   MacDonald has insulated himself by firing reporters at the tribal
newspaper and radio station and replacing them with his supporters,
and by contracting with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide
on-reservation investigators, Chapela said.
   ``With that move, there is no place on the reservation that a
Navajo person can go to present allegations of fraud,
misappropriation or misuse of tribal monies without having to go
through Mr. MacDonald,'' he said.
   Duane Beyal, a spokesman for former tribal chairman Peterson Zah,
said two of the 109 chapters, or precincts, on the reservation have
called for MacDonald's resignation and others were considering doing
so.
   Zah has not demanded the chairman's resignation but has asked for
a separate tribal investigation.
   MacDonald's part in the ranch land sale is under investigation by
a federal grand jury, but no charges have been filed.
   In 1977, a U.S. District Court jury failed to reach a verdict
against him on fraud and income-tax-evasion charges. Several
businessmen had testified they were asked for bribes in exchange for
business _ claims similar to those raised in the current Senate
investigation.
   MacDonald, a flamboyant former project engineer for Hughes
Aerospace of Tucson, ousted the conservative Zah by a 750-vote
margin of 60,000 votes cast in a November 1986 election. MacDonald
served three four-year terms before Zah defeated him in 1982.
   On Tuesday, the Senate committee listened to secretly taped
conversations in which MacDonald told a real estate broker how to
cover up the thousands of dollars the broker paid him for helping
arrange purchase of a ranch by the tribe.
   The broker, Byron T. ``Bud'' Brown, said he arranged for a
businessman to buy the 491,000-acre Big Boquillas ranch for $26.2
million and immediately sell it to the Navajos for $33.4 million.
Brown said he gave MacDonald $75,000 plus a BMW automobile as his
share of the profits.
   Aside from any questionable payments, Beyal said the land
purchase violated Navajo tradition.
   ``It's outside our aboriginal homelands ... according to Navajo
myth and legend,'' Beyal said. ``They're even fighting about the
northern boundary of Big Boquillas, which means all we did was buy a
new land dispute.''

<HEAD>Doctor Accused Of Impregnating Women, Then Secretly Aborting Fetuses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two women have filed lawsuits accusing
their former doctor of impregnating them during romantic liaisons,
then performing abortions without their knowledge. One said she had
been eight months pregnant.
   Robert W. York, an attorney who represents the women suing Dr.
Pravin D. Thakkar, said Tuesday his clients seek unspecified damages
for the loss of the fetuses and for emotional harm.
   ``I can't imagine what it would be like to be a mother and have
something growing inside you that you wanted and to have it taken
from you in the way that it was,'' York said. ``I think it's been
very hard for both of them to handle and to deal with.''
   Carmen Brutchen Hertzinger of Anderson filed her lawsuit last
week against Thakkar in Madison Circuit Court. Kathy Collins of
Madison County said in her Nov. 4 lawsuit that the abortion was
performed in her second or third month of pregnancy.
   Thakkar, an obstetrician-gynecologist, denied the allegations.
   ``All I can say is the facts in the matter will not stand up to
these allegations,'' he said.
   Hertzinger said she became Thakkar's patient in October 1982. On
her first visit to his office in nearby Frankton, about 30 miles
northeast of Indianapolis, Thakkar suggested they see each other
socially and Hertzinger accepted, according to the lawsuit.
   Hertzinger said she became pregnant with Thakkar's child in
February 1983. Thakkar is accused of administering drugs to
Hertzinger, causing her to deliver the fetus in his home eight
months later. He told her the baby was stillborn and he had taken
care of it, Hertzinger said.
   However, Hertzinger said Tuesday that she was conscious during
part of the procedure and heard a baby's cry.
   ``There were many times of unconsciousness but this was a time
that I was very conscious and there's something about a baby's cry
that you don't forget,'' she told WISH-TV in Indianapolis.
   Thakkar's attorney, Michael Lacey, said he was told Hertzinger's
infant was stillborn at a hospital.
   WISH-TV reported that although state law would require a death
certificate for a stillbirth, none was filed with the Madison County
Health Department during that time.
   Collins claims Thakkar fathered her unborn child and that he
aborted the fetus with a medical instrument during an examination
Jan. 9, 1988.
   During the examination, Collins said Tuesday, Thakkar told her
she was not carrying a child.
   ``I breathed a sigh of relief, and I felt an excruciating pain
that sent me to the top of the examining table,'' she said. ``I felt
the instrument dragging on the examining table. I told him to take
it out.''
   Thakkar again manipulated the instrument, causing more pain, she
said.
   ``At that point, I just rolled off the top of the examining
table. The instrument fell out, and I went to the bathroom,'' she
said.
   Thakkar denied Collins' claims, but did say he had an on-again,
off-again relationship with her at one time.
   His said the Indiana attorney general's office was investigating
Thakkar as a result of the complaints.
   Madison Circuit Judge Fredrick Spencer signed a temporary
restraining order against Thakkar last week preventing him from
attempting to sell, transfer or dispose of his assets pending a
hearing Monday.
   The order came after York filed a petition to set up a
receivership for Thakkar's assets, claiming the doctor advertised to
sell real estate in Madison County after Collins filed her complaint.

<HEAD>Driver Warned Passengers He Had No Brakes Moments Before Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A bus driver told passengers ``Hang on, I
have no brakes'' moments before his city bus plunged off a steep,
winding road and down a 60-foot cliff, killing 19 people and
injuring 22, authorities said.
   The driver, Enrique Hernandez de Jesus, and two children were
among the 14 bus occupants dead at the scene of the accident on the
outskirts of this Baja California resort 65 miles south of the U.S.
border.
   Five other passengers died at hospitals, Ensenada Fire Department
spokesman Jose Luis Chavez said. Several of the injured passengers
remained hospitalized Tuesday in critical condition, said Miroslava
Cuellar, a spokeswoman for the city of Ensenada.
   A mass funeral was planned for today, said Ramon Moreno, owner of
the Moreno Funeral Home, which is handling the arrangements.
   Baja California transit office records show the vehicle had gone
five years without a mechanical inspection and had no insurance as
required by state law, Cuellar said.
   ``It is well-known that there is corruption between the transport
companies and state transit officials,'' she said.
   ``Considering that these vehicles are allowed to operate without
inspections and without insurance, and that drivers are paid not a
salary but by the number of passengers they can cram into their
buses, it is clear there is corruption.''
   Officials of Transportes Rojo y Blanco (Red and White bus line),
the private transit company that owns the bus, declined comment
Tuesday about the accident.
   Chavez said he hoped the tragedy would prompt an investigation of
Ensenada's public transportation system, which he said is ``full of
buses ... (that are) coffins on wheels.''
   Most of the passengers on the bus bound for downtown were from a
poor neighborhood of Ensenada, a city of 78,000 people, but it
wasn't immediately known if any of the occupants were from outside
of Mexico.
   The accident occurred Monday as the bus, traveled a steep, windy
stretch of road four miles northeast of downtown.
   The bus apparently was going too fast when Hernandez came to a
sharp curve, causing the vehicle to careen over an embankment,
Chavez said.
   It tore through the wire fence of the Ensenada Country Club and
rolled several times down a dirt slope, stopping about 100 feet from
the club's swimming pool. The roof of the mangled bus was flattened
almost to the floor in some places, authorities said.
   ``People started screaming and pushing, trying to get to the
door, and then everything was flying,'' passenger Juana Santiago,
19, said from her bed at Ensenada General Hospital. ``I hugged my
baby and closed my eyes. I don't remember anything that happened
after that.''
   Santiago, who was taking her daughter to a vaccine center,
suffered a broken leg. She said her daughter was not injured
seriously, but her mother-in-law, who was seated next to her, was
dead.
   One passenger told fire officials that the driver yelled, ``Hang
on tight, I have no brakes,'' moments before the bus' plunge.
   A woman who lives about 200 yards from the accident scene said
she ran to see what happened after hearing a tremendous crash.
   ``It was a horror scene,'' said Leticia Perez de la Rosa.
``People were screaming, begging for help and I started to cry.''
   Eduardo Guillen, commander of the Baja California judicial police
in Ensenada, said the state has ordered an immediate inspection of
all buses in the city.
   ``If the company is found to be responsible (for the accident
through negligence), then it will have to pay for all damages,''
Guillen said.

<HEAD>Tamil Rebels Ask UN To Mediate Ethnic Conflict</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A militant Tamil separatist group said
today it has appealed to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to
mediate an end the 5-year ethnic conflict that has claimed 8,500
lives in Sri Lanka.
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most powerful Tamil
guerrilla group, also called for an immediate cease-fire and the
withdrawal of the estimated 47,000 Indian soldiers on the Indian
Ocean island.
   Indian troops were sent to Sri Lanka in 1987 to disarm the Tigers
in order to enforce an Indian-sponsored peace accord.
   The Tigers initially accepted the accord but later reneged,
resuming attacks on the country's Sinhalese ethnic majority and
battling the Indian peacekeeping force.
   The Tigers, in a letter to the U.N., claimed ``Indian troops
under the cover of `peacekeeping' operations continue to engage
themselves in a ruthless and brutal war against the innocent
civilian masses, causing intolerable suffering to the Tamil people.''
   The Tigers accused Indian soldiers of committing torture,
executions without trial and ``extermination'' of more than 200
prominent Tamils who opposed the 1987 accord.
   In New Delhi, an Indian official rejected the Tigers' accusation,
calling it ``part of their usual propaganda.''
   A copy of the Tigers' appeal to the U.N. was sent by telex to
news offices in Colombo from the guerrillas' information office in
London.
   Its arrival coincided with today's withdrawal from northern Sri
Lanka of an Indian battalion, one of two the Sri Lankan Defense
Ministry announced Tuesday would return home within two weeks
following discussions between the Indian and Sri Lankan governments.
   Two other battalions, consisting of about 3,500 men, withdrew in
early January.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who took office Jan. 2, has
pledged to seek the withdrawal of Indian troops and to convert the
July 1987 Indian-Sri Lankan accord into a peace and friendship
treaty.
   The accord was signed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and
President Junius R. Jayewardene, Premadasa's predecessor.
   India, which once provided sanctuary to the Tigers on Indian
soil, became involved in the affairs of its small island neighbor
because of the political clout of Indian Tamils, who comprise about
7 percent of India's 880 million people.
   In Sri Lanka, Tamils account for 18 percent of the population of
16 million.
   The Tamils, like the majority of Indians, are Hindu. In Sri
Lanka, they claim they were discriminated against by the Sinhalese
Buddhist majority that comprises 75 percent of the population.
   The Tigers and other Tamil guerrilla groups launched their
separatist war in 1983, saying they needed their own homeland to
combat alleged discrimination in jobs, education and efforts to
impose the Sinhalese language on Tamil-speakers.
   Since then, more than 8,500 people have been killed. The majority
of the victims were Sinhalese civilians. More than 600 Indian
soldiers have been killed in ambushes or battles with the Tamil
guerrillas.

   A judge sentenced a reputed terrorist to 30
years in prison for transporting explosives, saying the defendant
was out ``for flesh and blood'' with planned bombings in retaliation
for the U.S. bombing of Libya.
   ``You are a member of the Japanese Red Army,'' U.S. District
Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr. told Yu Kikumura on Tuesday. ``You have
engaged in a course of terrorism. You planned to kill and injure
scores of people.
   ``There is no other conclusion that can be drawn but that you are
an international terrorist.''
   In his first statements in court since his arrest, the Japanese
national said prior to sentencing that his November conviction on
charges of transporting explosives and possessing firearms was
trumped up by the U.S. government to justify the bombing of Libya,
which he called a violation of international law.
   ``I denounce these immoral acts of state terrorism,'' the
36-year-old Kikumura said in heavily accented English. ``I do not
have the background claimed by the United States.''
   Throughout much of the six-hour sentencing hearing, Kikumura
smiled and chuckled through his black mustache and chest-length
beard.
   Lechner sentenced Kikumura to 30 years, unswayed by Kikumura's
claims of being a scapegoat and by defense lawyers' arguments that
the bombs found in his car at a New Jersey Turnpike rest stop may
have been intended only to damage property in New York City and not
injure people.
   ``There is only one conclusion to draw from the design and
construction of the bombs,'' Lechner said. ``They were intended and
designed for flesh and blood, not for bricks and mortar.''
   Lechner also noted that new federal guidelines prevent early
parole, telling Kikumura, ``What you are sentenced to is what will
you serve.''
   U.S. Attorney Samuel Alito said Kikumura planned to use the bombs
to destroy a Navy recruitment office in the Veteran's Administration
building in lower Manhattan.
   New Jersey state detective Joseph Fuentes testified at the
hearing that witnesses saw someone who looked like Kikumura at the
recruitment office, and the building's location was marked by a
felt-tip pen on a map found inside Kikumura's car.
   Also circled on the map were Columbia University, New York
University and City College of New York, Fuentes said.
   ``He's a terrorist and he has been a terrorist,'' said Alito, who
had asked for the maximum 100 years in prison. He argued that
Kikumura's lawyer, civil rights attorney William M. Kunstler,
offered no other reason why Kikumura had the three bombs.
   Alito said that had it not been for a chance encounter with an
alert New Jersey state trooper, Kikumura may have gotten away with
mass murder.
   ``If he is let out again, next time the odds are we will not be
so lucky,'' Alito said.
   The defense had asked for 27 to 33 months' imprisonment and in a
plea bargain reserved the right to appeal the conviction over the
issue of whether Kikumura's car had been searched legally.
   Investigators testified they used hotel and store receipts to
track Kikumura's travels through New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and West
Virginia as he picked up bomb parts before his April 12 arrest.
   Kikumura was trained at a terrorist camp in Lebanon and planned
to carry out the bombing in conjunction with the April 14 attack on
a USO club in Naples, Italy, that killed five people, including a
U.S. servicewoman, Alito said.
   Kikumura's arrest came two days before the Naples blast, which
was on the second anniversary of the U.S. air strike against Libya
in which the residence of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was damaged.
   Found in Kikumura's car were 3-foot long steel canisters packed
with gunpowder and lead shot, electrical fusing devices, clocks and
precision tools, authorities said.

<HEAD>Hunger Strike By Black Detainees Spreads To Port City</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 blacks detained
in Port Elizabeth have joined a hunger strike, a civil rights group
said today, raising to about 300 the number of detainees threatening
to starve themselves unless they are freed or charged.
   The hunger strike, which began in the Johannesburg area on Jan.
23, represents one of the most dramatic challenges to the policy of
detention without trial since the national state of emergency was
declared in June 1986.
   The nationwide civil rights group Black Sash said today that 105
detainees at St. Albans Prison in Port Elizabeth _ many of them held
since 1986 _ began the hunger strike on Monday.
   In a statement released today, the detainees said:
   ``Notwithstanding 32 months of continuous detention without
trial, no case has been brought against us. ... ``We are left with
no alternative but to take our lives into our own hands ... and to
demand our immediate release from this dehumanizing detention.''
   They said in the statement that they would consume neither food
nor liquids until their demands are met.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the state of emergency. An estimated 1,000 to
1,500 people remain in detention.
   On Tuesday, the Law and Order Ministry declined to comment on
reports that some of the detainees wrote an open letter to Adriaan
Vlok, the law and order minister, warning him they would starve
themselves to death unless freed.
   The only government comment on the protest has been a statement
from prison officials saying in part: ``It does happen from time to
time that prisoners go on so-called hunger strikes. The Prisons
Services deals responsibly with such situations.''
   The hunger strike was started more than two weeks ago by 20
detainees at Diepkloof Prison, between Johannesburg and the huge
black township of Soweto. About 170 more detainees at Diepkloof
subsequently joined the strike, a group of detainees' parents said
at a news conference Tuesday.
   According to the Black Sash, the detainees at St. Albans Prison
include more than 50 anti-apartheid leaders in their third year of
detention, including prominent activists who helped organize a
successful black consumer boycott in 1985.
   Lawyers have predicted that several of the activists affiliated
with the now-banned United Democratic Front may be charged with
treason and put on trial. Three senior front leaders from Transvaal
Province were convicted of treason last year after a three-year
trial.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest and a range of statements the
government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has
not been comprehensive.

   A judge dismissed a lawsuit against the FBI
by a 17-year-old student, who said he was under illegal surveillance
because he had written foreign embassies for information to complete
a sixth-grade project.
   Authorities have said the lawsuit, which was dismissed Tuesday,
was the first seeking to wipe out FBI files on First Amendment
activities.
   ``We're quite upset,'' said Edgar Patterson, whose son Todd was
the subject of FBI surveillance. ``We think the Attorney General
should issue a warning like the Surgeon General that says all
letters written to foreign countries may result in an FBI file on
you.''
   Todd Patterson, now a senior at Don Bosco Preparatory School in
Ramsey, sought a halt to the surveillance, deletion of the FBI file,
and unspecified damages for invasion of his privacy.
   The FBI has acknowledged it kept a file on Patterson when he was
a sixth-grader.
   Patterson said the FBI violated his privacy rights by tampering
with mail, but U.S. District Judge Alfred M. Wolin said none of the
secret documents supported Patterson's claim, nor another allegation
_ that the FBI wiretapped his family's telephone.
   Wolin, in throwing out the lawsuit, reviewed several FBI
documents that were not made available to Patterson. The government
had said releasing the documents would damage national security.
   Lawyers for Patterson said his right of free speech was violated
because the youth was penalized for pursuing his education and
expressing himself.
   Attorney Frank Askin, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the
American Civil Liberties Union and Patterson, criticized the judge
for basing his decision on FBI documents not available to the
plaintiff.
   ``We brought this suit against secret government and we got a
secret judgment,'' he said. ``The family is disappointed by the
decision.''
   To complete his school project _ a homemade encyclopedia,
Patterson wrote to 169 embassies, using the return address of his
father's company, Laboratory Disposal Products Inc.
   At least 50 pieces of mail arrived at his door damaged, which
Askin argued was evidence of surveillance that violated the youth's
First Amendment right to ``seek information and correspond freely.''
   Patterson has said he was concerned the file would hurt his
chances of entering the diplomatic service.
   Dick Lavinthal, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office, said
government attorneys would not comment on the dismissal of the
lawsuit until they have a chance to review the decision.
   Todd Patterson was not available for comment. His father said he
was at school working on a school project: the school yearbook.

   Anti-abortion activists obtained a court
order temporarily blocking an abortion for a comatose woman just
hours after her haggard husband won a judge's permission to have the
operation performed.
   ``All I want to do is save my wife's life,'' Martin Klein, 34, of
Upper Brookville on Long Island said Tuesday after state judge
Bernard McCaffrey named him guardian of his wife, Nancy, as a
courtroom packed with family members, abortion supporters and
opponents, and reporters looked on.
   Three hours later, anti-abortion activists John Short of
Farmingdale and John Broderick of Syosett won a temporary stay of
the order from Appellate Division Judge Vincent Balletta Jr. despite
objections from the state attorney general's office.
   Short and Broderick, who are seeking to become guardians of Mrs.
Klein and her fetus, and Klein must file papers today with the full
Appellate Division, which is expected to issue a ruling by Friday.
   Mrs. Klein, who is about 17 weeks pregnant, has been in a coma at
North Shore University Hospital since a car accident Dec. 13.
   Her husband sought an abortion after several physicians said it
could help her recovery, but the hospital said it would need a court
order to perform the operation.
   McCaffrey ruled that an abortion was not necessary to save Mrs.
Klein's life, but said the issue was what constituted ``the
constitutional rights of a hospitalized comatose woman who is
approximately 17 weeks pregnant.''
   The judge said that, based on medical testimony and records, Mrs.
Klein is incompetent and a guardian should be appointed.
   He gave Klein permission to authorize any medical procedures that
may be necessary to preserve his wife's life, specifically ruling
that Klein is authorized to approve an abortion.
   ``The responsibilities of the guardian in this instance are
awesome'' because of the woman's extensive brain injury and because
the only type of abortion she could have would involve a very high
risk, McCaffrey said.
   He noted that if Mrs. Klein were competent, she would have the
absolute right to an abortion for any reason up to the 24th week of
pregnancy.
   ``This case is not an abortion case, it's a guardianship case,''
said Elizabeth Bradford of the state attorney general's office.
``Clearly, if Mrs. Klein was given the choice of husband of nine
years versus a stranger ... she would opt for her husband.''
   Klein's attorney, Sidney Schutz, labeled the anti-abortion
activists ``interlopers adding to the problems of the family.''
   McCaffrey had dismissed their petitions last week, agreeing that
neither Broderick nor Short had a standing in the procedure.
   In a two-day hearing last week, five medical experts testified
that pregnancy increased the risks for Mrs. Klein and could threaten
her life. But the Nassau County district attorney produced experts
who testified the pregnancy was not life-threatening.
   Short, founder of the Long Island Right-To-Life Committee,
rejects the possibility that an abortion would improve Mrs. Klein's
condition.
   ``The risk physically is equal to abort the child and carry the
child to term,'' Short argued. ``We're saying nobody addressed the
question of her psychological health. Were she to recover, being
told that her child is alive, psychologically, could only be a
benefit. Telling her that they killed the child, psychologically,
could be a disaster.''
   And if Mrs. Klein should die, Short said, ``why not let the baby
be an extension of Mrs. Klein's life?''
   The Kleins have a 3-year-old daughter.

   A teen-ager armed with an assault rifle and
clad in combat fatigues was arrested on charges of wounding a woman
and her infant son in a sniping attack while they were driving on
the outskirts of this city.
   The teen-ager, who was also armed with a shotgun, scattered
police with semiautomatic gunfire before he was captured Monday
evening about three hours after the attack, police said.
   A squad of about 50 officers using dogs and two helicopters were
involved in the search at a suburban housing subdivision.
   Lynn Fess, 33, was in serious condition Tuesday at St. Francis
Medical Center after undergoing surgery to close a grazing wound to
the head, said Chris Lofgren, a hospital spokesman. Her 14-month-old
son, Adam, was in fair condition with an arm wound.
   At a juvenile court hearing, State's Attorney Kevin Lyons filed
two counts of attempted murder and two counts of armed violence and
aggravated battery and asked that the teen-ager be tried as an adult.
   Circuit Judge M. Peter Ault scheduled a Feb. 16 hearing to review
the case and ordered a psychiatric exam to determine if the youth is
competent to stand trial. His name was not released because he is a
juvenile, Peoria County Sheriff's Sgt. Dan Basfield said.
   ``At this time, we don't know what the motive was or the
reasoning behind it,'' said Sheriff George Shadid.
   ``He obviously has a serious problem to do something like this. I
think he had every intention when he shot at the lady and the baby
of hitting someone,'' Shadid said.
   The suspect, who was wearing combat fatigues when arrested,
attended Richwoods High School, The Peoria Journal-Star reported.
Mrs. Fess was a special education teacher at the school, but school
officials said she did not know the teen-ager.
   Defense attorney Gerard Serritella spoke on behalf of his parents
at the hearing.
   ``The parents are broken-hearted,'' Serritella said. ``All of
their sympathy goes out to the victims.''
   Police said the gunman shot at Mrs. Fess's car from behind a
guardrail along the road. They found seven bullets in her car.
   Another son, Matthew, 5, was in the car but escaped injury.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Hopes Leyva's Sentence Will Help Heal Emotional Scars
Of Victims</HEAD>

   A prosecutor said he hopes the 2{-year prison
sentence a preacher received for sodomizing two teen-agers will help
heal the emotional wounds suffered by the scores of boys the
evangelist molested since the 1960s.
   ``I think the victims kept a lot of things inside for a long
time,'' Roanoke County Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Randy Leach
said Tuesday after Mario ``Tony'' Leyva's sentencing in Circuit
Court.
   Leyva, who could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison,
received 15 months for each of two counts of child sodomy.
   The 43-year-old, self-ordained Pentecostal preacher from
Columbus, Ga., apologized for lying when he testified in September
that he had not committed any homosexual acts with minors.
   But Judge Kenneth Trabue chastized Leyva, upheld the penalty
recommended by the jury and said he wished he could give the
preacher even more time.
   ``I suppose the thing that troubles me most is somebody of the
cloth, who knows the truth, has openly and flagrantly lied,'' Trabue
said. ``There was an overt effort to poison the jury on your
behalf.''
   Leyva changed his story in October when he agreed to a plea
bargain in a similar federal case, in which he still faces
sentencing. He told the FBI he had molested at least 100 boys since
the 1960s, when he was a preacher in North Carolina.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennie Montgomery said Leyva and two
fellow Pentecostal preachers, Rias Edward Morris and Freddie M.
Herring, used Leyva's traveling ministry to gain access to trouble
boys they used for sex.
   The three pleaded guilty in October to federal charges they
shipped boys across state lines to use them in illegal sex acts in
exchange for money and favors.
   Morris, 47, was the organist in Leyva's ministry. Herring, 50,
founded the Lighthouse Assembly in Douglasville, Ga.
   Under their plea bargains, Leyva faces a maximum prison sentence
of 20 years and the other ministers 15 years.
   Leyva and the others, who were not charged in the state case,
have been undergoing psychiatric evaluations at a federal prison in
Butner, N.C.

<TEXT>
   A TV news editor hired away from his station
by a competitor has been charged with unlawfully entering the
computer system of his former employer to gain access to
confidential information about news stories.
   Using knowledge of the system to bypass a security shield he
helped create, Michael I. Shapiro examined and destroyed files
relating to news stories at Tampa's WTVT, according to the charges
filed Tuesday.
   Telephone records seized during Shapiro's arrest in Clearwater
showed he made several calls last month to the computer line at
WTVT, where he worked as assignment editor until joining competitor
WTSP as an assistant news editor in October.
   Shapiro, 33, was charged with 14 counts of computer-related
crimes grouped into three second-degree felony categories: offenses
against intellectual property, offenses against computer equipment
and offenses against computer users. He was released on his own
recognizance from Hillsborough County Jail.
   If convicted, Shapiro could be sentenced to up to 15 years in
prison and be fined $10,000 for each second-degree felony count.
   Bob Franklin, WTVT's interim news director, said WTVT management
discovered several computer files missing on Jan. 12 and Shapiro was
called to provide help. But Franklin said Shapiro claimed not to
know the cause of the problem.
   ``Subsequent investigation has revealed that, at least since
early January, WTVT's newsroom computer system had been the subject
of repeated actual and attempted `break-ins.' The computers contain
highly confidential information concerning the station's current and
future news stories and the station's future story assignments,''
Franklin said in a statement read at a news conference.
   Franklin said Shapiro was one of two people who has had
responsibility for daily operation and maintenance of the computer
system since it was installed about eight months ago.
   ``The other is currently employed by us,'' Franklin said,
referring to systems operation manager Cary Williams.
   Terry Cole, news director at WTSP, said Shapiro has been placed
on leave of absence from his job.
   Shapiro did not respond to messages left at WTSP asking for
comment, and the station would not give out his home phone number.
   Sam Jones, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement, said the agency's investigation determined that Shapiro
gained access to WTVT's computer on at least four occasions in
January by placing telephone calls from the rival station and from
his Clearwater home, where a computer and WTVT's computer manual
were found during a search Tuesday.
   ``There is no evidence or information to indicate that anyone
else was involved other than Mr. Shapiro,'' Jones said.
   Franklin said Shapiro, employed by WTVT from February 1986 to
September 1988, was not fired from the station but rather left to
advance his career at WTSP.
   ``Mike was a very competent assignment editor,'' Franklin said.
``He was very good at what he did. He left on good terms.''

   A judge has warned Berenice Rogers
to slip out of her high heels before strolling around her condo.
   Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Richard Burk said Tuesday that if
Rogers persists in annoying her downstairs neighbors with her noisy
footsteps, she could be pacing inside a jail cell.
   Bernard and Sonja Arbuse, who live directly below Rogers at the
Sun and Surf Condominium, said the problem began in 1984 when Rogers
had Italian tile laid in her $235,000 condo.
   The couple's attorney, Charles Nugent, requested Burk to order
Rogers to install carpeting.
   Rogers said she laid Oriental and sheepskin rugs and removes her
heels at the front door, but she does not want carpet.
   ``I don't believe Mrs. Rogers is required to give up her right to
decorate,'' the judge said. ``And I don't believe I can require her
to stop walking.''

<HEAD>Union Says California Underpaying Women Since '30s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of the nation's largest sex
discrimination salary case began with a state union's charge that
California intentionally began paying women less than men in the
early 1930s and never stopped.
   The state ``explicitly considered sex'' when it overhauled its
civil service classifications in 1930-31, said William Dickens, a
labor economist who was the first witness at the trial Tuesday.
   Dickens, an associate professor of economics at the University of
California at Berkeley, cited a 1930 report recommending the state
``pay somewhat higher for those occupations filled predominantly by
men.''
   Dickens was the leadoff witness for the California State
Employees Association, which is suing the state on behalf of 60,000
to 70,000 past and present female employees.
   Deputy Attorney General Richard Tullis defended the state's wage
system, calling California ``a very progressive state.''
   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, hearing the case without
a jury, is limiting testimony in the first phase of the trial to the
intent and effects of state policies in the 1930s, when the current
wage system is said to have originated.
   The union must prove that when the state's Civil Service
Commission reclassified jobs and pay scales it deliberately set
wages for women at a lower rate than for men.
   It must then prove that that early policy accounts for pay gaps
existing at least through the 1970s.
   Lawyers for the state deny it ever had a policy of intentional
pay discrimination and say any trace of bias was eliminated in a
reorganization of job classifications in 1937-38.
   Dickens said the changes in state pay classifications in 1937-38
were no more than an attempt to ``refine the system,'' while leaving
the basic structure in place.
   State lawyers say damages in the case could run into the billions
of dollars, an estimate the union calls highly inflated.

<HEAD>Two People Killed; Raises to 10 Slain in Pre-Election Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more people were killed in political
violence in central Kingston, raising to 10 the number of deaths
linked to this week's general elections, police said today.
   Details of the killings were sketchy, but according to a
spokeswoman for Prime Minister Edward Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party,
one of the deaths occurred when a gunman attacked a group of Seaga
supporters Tuesday evening and he was shot by pursuing police.
   About a half-hour later, a Seaga supporter was shot nearby, said
the party official, who asked not to be identified by name.
   Police said the two killings were related to politics surrounding
Thursday's election, but would not say which parties were involved.
   At a rally in Kingston late Tuesday, Michael Manley, Seaga's
opponent in the election, closed his campaign with a plea for peace.
   ``We cannot build a Jamaica that is worth anything unless we
begin with a respect for life,'' he told several thousand supporters.
   Manley said one of those killed Tuesday was a boy who was ``shot
for no reason.'' He said the other was a gunman, but did not
identify the man's party.
   Thursday's are Jamaica's first national elections since 1980,
when an estimated 700 people died in political violence over an
nine-month campaign. The current campaign opened Jan. 15 and has not
generated anything comparable to the 1980 mayhem.
   The violence has been confined mainly to the capital's slums and
rural districts far removed from the major tourist hotels on the
north coast.
   Manley, who served as prime minister from 1972 to 1980, is
favored in opinion polls to defeat the conservative Seaga, who has
been one of the closest U.S. allies in the Caribbean.

<HEAD>Senator: Marcos Rules Out Deals For Coming Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferdinand Marcos has ruled out any
deals as the price for coming home and asked President Corazon
Aquino to tell her relatives ``to stop bothering him about money
matters,'' an opposition senator said today.
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said the ailing ex-president made the
statement to Vice President Salvador Laurel in Hawaii last Thursday
and asked that the message be relayed to Mrs. Aquino.
   Laurel had told reporters Saturday that he was carrying secret
messages for Mrs. Aquino from the hospitalized Marcos, who has asked
to return from exile in Hawaii to die in his homeland.
   Mrs. Aquino refused to see Laurel, and he has not disclosed the
messages.
   Enrile, however, said Laurel told him Marcos wanted Mrs. Aquino
``to instruct her relatives not to bother President Marcos about
money matters.'' Enrile said Laurel told him of Marcos' remarks on
Sunday.
   ``As far as I know, according to the vice president, Marcos told
him `I'm not going to make any deals with anybody,''' Enrile told
reporters.
   Last year, Mrs. Aquino's uncle, Rep. Francisco Sumulong, and a
cousin, Rep. Egmidio Tanjuatco, visited the 71-year-old Marcos.
Their visits and that of Laurel prompted speculation Marcos was
prepared to negotiate.
   The Philippine government says Marcos and his associates
embezzled up to $10 billion before Marcos was ousted in a February
1986 civilian-military uprising. Mrs. Aquino has said the government
will not discuss his return until he gives back the money.
   In October, a U.S. grand jury indicted Marcos and his wife Imelda
on racketeering charges for allegedly embezzling more than $100
million and stashing much of it in the United States.
   Mrs. Aquino today said she told Mateo Caparas, chairman of the
Presidential Commission on Good Government, to contact Marcos'
representatives in the United States for a deal on Marcos' return.
   ``But he (Caparas) will not negotiate,'' she told reporters. ``I
will see what they have to offer first of all, and first of all, if
indeed they want to talk, because to this date, we have not received
any letter authorizing certain persons to speak for Mr. Marcos or
Mrs. Marcos.''
   Teodoro Locsin Jr., publisher of the Philippine Daily Globe and
Mrs. Aquino's speechwriter, today wrote that Caparas told U.S.
Justice Department officials he was authorized to negotiate with
Marcos and demanded ``total discretion'' in his talks.
   Locsin said U.S. officials warned Caparas they would cease
cooperation in investigations of Marcos and seize his property in
New York if Manila reached an unacceptable agreement for his return.
The properties, which the Philippine government wants to sell, are
estimated at $300 million.
   Locsin quoted Caparas as saying U.S. officials had threatened to
withhold evidence of Marcos' alleged secret bank accounts received
from the Swiss government.
   Locsin said U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella of New York told
Caparas that U.S. officials could also agree to a deal that would be
unfavorable to Manila.
   Caparas refused to return calls from The Associated Press.
   In Honolulu's St. Francis Medical Center, Marcos remained in
guarded condition connected to a respirator, but a hospital
spokeswoman reported his condition was improving.
   He was admitted Jan. 15 and underwent a tracheotomy to drain
fluid from his lungs. He was hospitalized twice in December for
congestive heart failure.

   Rock Hudson was guilty of immoral and indecent
behavior for failing to tell his homosexual companion he had AIDS,
an attorney said in closing arguments in an $11 million lawsuit
against the actor's estate.
   ``Hudson did not give a damn about (his lover Marc) Christian or
the countless other people who could have died,'' Christian's
lawyer, Harold Rhoden, said Tuesday.
   ``The duty to warn is what this case is all about. Someone who
has AIDS has that duty. It's right. It is decent. It is moral,''
Rhoden said. ``To do what Rock Hudson and Mark Miller (his
secretary) did is immoral, is indecent.''
   Attorneys for Hudson's estate and Miller were to give closing
arguments today in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
   Rhoden contends that Christian, 35, an aspiring musician who
lived with Hudson during the last two years of his life, is entitled
to compensation for the ``enhanced fear'' he suffered when he found
out his lover had acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Christian testified last month he and Hudson had unprotected oral
and anal sex three to five times a week for eight months after
Hudson learned he had AIDS in June 1984.
   Hudson _ who played the leading man to such actresses as Doris
Day, Elizabeth Taylor and Linda Evans in movies and TV _ died Oct.
5, 1985, a few months after his battle with AIDS became public.
Christian claims he did not find out Hudson was dying of the disease
until the public did.
   Miller, who is being sued along with the estate for keeping
Hudson's secret, contends that the movie star broke off his affair
with Christian before he knew he had the deadly disease.
   Rhoden has acknowledged Christian has no symptoms of AIDS and
tested negative for the virus. But he maintains this is irrelevant
because he says his client could develop AIDS at any time.
   Rhoden asked jurors to disregard defense claims that Christian
and Hudson did not have sex, reminding them that a witness had
described seeing the two men in an amorous nude embrace at Hudson's
home after a party.
   He also read passages from love letters Hudson wrote to Christian
while he was in Israel filming ``The Ambassador,'' his last picture.
   ``I love you, my baby,'' said one of the letters. In another,
Hudson said how much he missed Christian, and, ``I had to call to
hear your voice. I love you.''
   The attorney said jurors might wonder what Christian would have
done had he known that Hudson had AIDS.
   ``Marc Christian loved Rock Hudson. I think he would have stayed
with Hudson, tried to care for him and made his last days as happy
as possible,'' said Rhoden. ``But he would not have had any act of
sexual intercourse with Rock Hudson because this boy is not intent
on committing suicide.''

<HEAD>Charges To Be Filed Against White Extremist and Tutu's Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today said it
will prosecute politically sensitive cases involving a
white-supremacist leader, the son of black Archbishop Desmond Tutu
and a white man who harassed the black Anglican clergyman.
   The three cases are not linked directly, and the government
appeared to be trying to show its willingness to act against
suspected offenders across the political spectrum.
   Klaus von Lieres, attorney general for the Johannesburg region,
announced the decisions at a news conference.
   He said Eugene TerreBlanche, leader of the Afrikaner Resistance
Movement, would be charged with malicious damage to property.
TerreBlanche allegedly tried to ram his car through a gate at an
Afrikaner historical monument near Johannesburg in December.
   The attorney general said a charge of criminal injury would be
filed against Willeboer Venter, who allegedly swore at Archbishop
Tutu and threatened to break his neck in June when the
anti-apartheid leader was boarding an airplane at Jan Smuts Airport
outside Johannesburg.
   Tutu's son, Trevor, is to face six charges in connection with
three separate incidents dating back to October, when he allegedly
obstructed a police officer, von Lieres said.
   Trevor Tutu, 32, also will be charged with falsely telling police
at Jan Smuts Airport on Dec. 31 that there might have been a bomb in
his luggage. He also will be charged with malicious damage to
property in an altercation with police when he was arraigned at a
magistrate's court on Jan. 3.
   No trial dates have been set, von Lieres said.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no vote in national
affairs and whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Comatose Victim Of Cyanide Dies After Removal From Life Support</HEAD>

   Investigators were still trying to
determine how cyanide got into yogurt eaten by a 17-year-old boy,
who died after spending five weeks in a coma.
   Thomas Lee of Haddonfield died Tuesday at West Jersey
Hospital-Voorhees after he was removed from a respirator, said Leon
Rose, a lawyer for the youth's parents, Frances and Hsin-Yi Lee.
   The FBI has joined local and county officials in investigating
whether the poisoning should be treated as a homicide, suicide or
product-tampering case, although they say the last choice is highly
unlikely.
   ``We are still in the investigation until such time that there is
a determination made that it was not product tampering,'' said FBI
Agent John H. Kundts of the bureau's Philadelphia office. He said
the case would be presented to a grand jury Feb. 15.
   Cyanide was recovered from a Rutgers University laboratory in
Camden, where the boy's father is a renowned biology professor, and
from the family's home, but it remains unknown whether the samples
matched cyanide found in the yogurt.
   Breyers, makers of the yogurt, said it determined the cyanide did
not originate in any of its production facilities.
   The teen-ager had been in critical condition since eating the
black cherry yogurt on his way to school Jan. 3. Doctors had given
him little chance of recovery.
   Rose said the boy's parents, court-appointed guardian Joseph
Kenney and physicians reached a unanimous decision Monday night to
remove the artificial life support.
   ``The medical testimony was clear and convincing ... that there
was no chance of a recovery to a cognitive and sapient state,'' Rose
said.
   Superior Court Judge Paul A. Lowengrub appointed Kenney as
guardian last month when it became evident his family would try to
remove life support.
   Hospital officials and investigators at the Camden County
prosecutor's office declined comment on the case. A family friend
who answered the telephone at the Lee home said the parents were not
home.

<TEXT>
   Talks between the opposition and government
on ending of Poland's protracted economic crisis resumed today as a
strike for higher pay closed a coal mine that supplies the country's
largest electric power plant.
   A partial work stoppage that began Monday at the Belchatow
bituminous coal mine and power plant 90 miles southwest of Warsaw
spread today to shut the mine at 12:01 a.m., state television and
Solidarity reported.
   The government said the strike at the mine could eventually
threaten power supplies in central Poland but gave no details on
when that might occur.
   Television said 4,000 people were on strike, while the free trade
union movement's information service in Warsaw said the number was
8,000.
   The complex employs 12,000 workers.
   At the Council of Ministers Palace, 40 people from the government
and opposition began work on seeking a national consensus on
economic reform and social policy.
   The working group meeting is part of ``round-table'' negotiations
that began Monday and are expected to last up to six weeks.
   Solidarity wants the talks first to lead to the restoration of
its legal status after a seven-year ban.
   At the opening session, the government said Solidarity could be
reinstated if the opposition agrees take seats in partliament, which
Communist authorities would still control.
   Opposition leaders have balked at the proposal as an attempt to
make them share responsibility for austerity measures they would be
denied a role in formulating.
   The working group that met today is the first of three to start
negotiations since Monday's inaugural session. Solidarity chairman
Lech Walesa and Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, who led their
opposition and government delegations at Monday's talks, were not
present at today's meeting.
   A working group on trade unions is to begin meeting Thursday and
a group on political reforms on Friday.
   Wladyslaw Baka, the member of the ruling Politburo responsible
for the economy, and Witold Trzeciakowski, an economist on a
citizen's group formed by Walesa, were the senior participants at
the talks.
   Other government participants were Industry Minister Mieczyslaw
Wilczek and Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula. For the
opposition, participants included Ryszard Bugaj, an independent
economist and Gabriel Janowski, of the farmers' opposition group
Rural Solidarity.
   Chief government spokesman Jerzy Urban said opposition
participants at the negotiations would not be asked to intervene to
stop the Belchatow strike, but Walesa sent a representative to the
strikers in an apparent bid to moderate the dispute.
   The strike, because of its timing as the long-awaited talks get
started, appears politically delicate for both the opposition and
authorities.
   Communist Party officials entered the talks despite internal
opposition from hardliners, arguing that an agreement with
Solidarity would help keep labor peace.
   It appeared the strike, begun by local Solidarity activists,
could become a test of the national leadership's ability to fulfill
that implied promise.
   The workers seek a $59 monthly pay increase at a time of 60
percent inflation and chronic consumer shortages.
   The workers' current wages are not known.
   On Tuesday, Urban said 173 pay disputes were reported nationwide
in January, three times higher than December, and that ``alarming''
wage pressures led to 39 strikes last month.
   The complex where today's strike was occurring is part of a
public coal-and-power monopoly formed last year during a government
restructuring program that removed some industry from state control.
   The government has warned against enterprises paying wages that
exceed their financial earnings. Raises are supposed to come out of
higher productivity.

   Monica Himes says she's been urged not to
``rock the boat,'' but she intends fight a $20 traffic citation for
not putting lights on her motorized wheelchair.
   ``It's important for me to stand up for my rights,'' Mrs. Himes
said Tuesday. ``I guess I was just born a fighter.
   Mrs. Himes, 34, filed a complaint against a driver following a
near-collision Dec. 19 involving her wheelchair. She said she was
crossing within the pedestrian crosswalk when a car nearly hit her.
   ``I was well-lit,'' she said. ``I could have been seen.''
   But police issued her a citation for not having lights on her
wheelchair.
   Police Chief Patricia Kunchynski said the citation was a warning
to Mrs. Himes, who has multiple sclerosis, to do something so
vehicles can see her.
   But Mrs. Himes' attorney, Dale Lundquist, said no laws classify a
motorized wheelchair as a motor vehicle.
   A hearing on both complaints is set for March 7. A judge will
also hear a disorderly conduct complaint filed against Mrs. Himes by
an off-duty police officer who claimed she shouted obscenities while
discussing the matter in a store.
   Mrs. Himes, who has fought for six years to make the community
more accessible to the disabled, said her husband, Thomas, who works
for the county, told her, ``We have to live here. Don't rock the
boat.''
   But, she said, ``You can't back down. You gotta do what you gotta
do.''

   Chances of reaching the IRS toll-free telephone
line with a question about taxes have improved, but at last check,
the odds of getting a correct answer had not.
   ``Clearly there is room for improvement,'' the General Accounting
Office said in a report on its survey, which found Internal Revenue
Service ``telephone assistors'' gave the right answer on only 64
percent of 20 test questions that were asked in 1,776 calls.
   The IRS says its accuracy rate should not be judged solely on the
basis of a test survey and promises its assistors are better
equipped to give the right answer in the current filing season,
which ends April 17.
   GAO, an arm of Congress, called 29 IRS offices during last year's
filing season. The results, made public Tuesday:
   _Callers got through on the first try on 76 percent of the calls,
up markedly from 61 percent in 1987. On calls requiring five
attempts, the success rate rose to 93 percent, from 88 percent a
year earlier.
   _1,733 questions were answered.
   _1,110 answers (64 percent) were correct, although 111 (6 percent
of the total) were incomplete.
   _623 answers (36 percent) were wrong.
   The IRS answered a capital-gains question wrong 67 percent of the
time; child-care credit, 64 percent; taxability of scholarships, 60
percent. IRS assistors gave the right answer only half the time on
deducting personal interest.
   GAO said it could not compare the accuracy rate of the latest
survey with earlier tests, because questions were different.
However, GAO was given correct answers to 79 percent of its
questions in 1987.
   The IRS did its own survey last filing season, checking answers
to actual taxpayer calls and finding 72.4 percent accuracy.
   A key reason for the inaccuracies that GAO found last year was
that 17 of the 20 test questions required the IRS assistor to ask
the caller for more details, and the assistors failed to do so.
   ``Probing is important because taxpayers who call with questions
frequently are not sufficiently familiar with the tax laws to
initially provide assistors with all the information needed to
answer their questions correctly,'' GAO wrote.
   On questions affected by recent tax law changes _ especially the
landmark 1986 overhaul _ the IRS gave the right answer to GAO 59
percent of the time. IRS was right on 72 percent of questions not
affected by change.
   GAO emphasized that the inaccuracy rate applies only to the
specific questions that were asked in the survey _ not necessarily
to all the questions that taxpayers are likely to ask.
   IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said that in preparing for the
current filing season, ``We ... have expanded assistor training on
probing skills. In addition, we continue to emphasize to all
managers the need for quality review and providing immediate
feedback to assistors who fail to probe completely.''
   The IRS answered 20 million calls on the 4,359 toll-free
assistance lines last year. That represented about 85 percent of the
direct contact the IRS had with taxpayers.
   In most areas, the IRS answer line may be reached by dialing
1-800-424-1040, but there are different numbers in many locations.
The numbers are listed on Page 48 of the Form 1040A instructions and
Page 52 of Form 1040 instructions.
   Most telephoned questions are answered by ``front-line
assistors,'' who often are part-time employees earning between $6.50
and $11.70 an hour. If they cannot answer a question, they are
supposed to turn the caller over to a backup assistor, who has
received more training, has more reference material close at hand,
and who is paid as much as $14.32 an hour.
   However, the GAO survey indicated the backup assistors gave the
wrong answer to 40 percent of the questions, compared with 35
percent for the front-line employees. GAO said that could be because
the backup assistors had to answer the more difficult questions.

   A man accused of strangling a pregnant doctor in
her Bellevue Hospital office used to wander the halls in surgical
scrubs and went into operating rooms unhindered during surgery, a
newspaper reported today.
   Meanwhile, a Bellevue nurse's aide who police believe Steven
Smith had picked out as his second victim said Smith sweet-talked
her and then hounded her when he learned she had a boyfriend.
   ``He wanted all my time,'' said the aide, Viola Durham. ``I
ignored it. He never threatened me.''
   Smith is charged with raping and murdering pathologist Kathryn
Hinnant on Jan. 7.
   A detective's report filed Monday said Smith told police that
``there was a girl known to him as Viola ... that was his age (who)
could well have been his next victim.'' Ms. Durham said she was
shocked by the report.
   New York Newsday reported today that police believe that Smith
often walked around the hospital in hospital pajamas or surgical
scrubs, ate in the staff cafeteria and slept in various hospital
rooms.
   When he allegedly killed Hinnant, Smith was wearing a white lab
coat over surgical scrubs and had a stethoscope draped around his
neck, police said.
   Several hospital employees told police that Smith apparently was
not asked to leave the operating rooms, Newsday said, citing
unidentified sources.
   Bellevue spokesman Al Palmieri said he doubted the reports.
   ``I think it's unlikely even if he was dressed in surgical greens
with a mask on that he would be allowed to be in an operating room
just standing around,'' he said.
   ``We do have some operating rooms that allow for external
observation; that's a possibility.''

   Iranian leaders of all stripes are calling
for greater political and social freedom now that the war with Iraq
appears over and the Islamic revolution reaches its 10th anniversary
Feb. 11.
   As the country prepares to face the challenges of peace after
eight years of war in the Persian Gulf, progressive religious
figures are urging fresh interpretations of the sharia, Islam's
religious laws and cornerstone of Iran's rigid political and social
system.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's supreme authority, has thrown
his weight behind the trend.
   In a decree Jan. 4, he stressed the need for Islam to adapt to
the modern world. His decree was seen as one of his most important
pronouncements since the revolution that toppled Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi in 1979.
   He called on the conservative Council of Guardians, which has
repeatedly blocked key economic legislation on the grounds it
violated Islam's tenets, to avoid obscure theological arguments that
will ``drive us to dead ends.''
   Khomeini, 88 years old, was reflecting a groundswell of sentiment
among influential religious and political leaders seeking to move
Iran toward a ``Decade of Dawn.''
   The revolutionary patriarch, who during the war with Iraq
repeatedly appealed to his bickering officials for unity, refused
requests in November that he settle a fierce debate over economic
policy. He urged open discussion.
   He decreed that ``academic argument should be given a high place
in Islam and encouraged, rather than suppressed'' because of
``dogmatic interpretations and authoritarian outlooks.''
   Today, Tehran Radio announced that Khomeini has pardoned an
unspecified number of political prisoners in Iran in a general
amnesty. It said the government determined they ``no longer
constitute a threat to the revolution.''
   However, these progressive moves are taking place at the same
time as a new wave of dissident executions, in which by most
accounts hundreds have died.
   The executions, along with the prospect of a power struggle for
supremacy in the post-Khomeini era and the influence among 50
million Iranians of the deeply entrenched mullahs, or Shiite Moslem
priests, have made many people skeptical about just how far Iran
will progress along a progressive course.
   Travellers from Tehran, the capital, say many Iranians refer to
the next 10 years (the Decade of Dawn to officials) as the ``Decade
of Suffering.''
   Nonetheless, there are clear indications the winds of change are
blowing stronger.
   Freedom of expression and other liberties were widely restricted
during the Persian Gulf war, but with the case-fire restrictions
appear to have been relaxed.
   Hojatoleslam Mohammad Javad Hojati Kermani, a middle-ranking
cleric who has become Iran's most popular newspaper columnist,
recently chided traditionalist mullahs.
   ``In the same way that permitting what God has forbidden is
forbidden, forbidding what God has permitted is also forbidden,'' he
wrote in Tehran's Ettela'at newspaper.
   ``I am puzzled why our religious authorities consider the safe
course to be obsessively guarding the fortress of what has been
forbidden rather than guarding the flower garden of what is indeed
permitted by God.''
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, viewed as the government's
leading pragmatist and architect of efforts to open up Iran after a
decade of isolation, noted in a recent speech: ``We still have a lot
of unanswered questions with regard to society.
   ``We have not come forward with clear principles in our foreign
policy ... or in religious matters that vastly differ today from
earlier eras of Islam.''
   After the sacrifices of the war, in which by some estimates 1
million Iranians were killed, Iranians want to enjoy the fruits of
peace.
   Scheherazade Daneshku, a Paris-based Iranian analyst, noted that
leaders like Rafsanjani understand that now ``some of the more
puritanical and uncompromising aspects of Islamic rule will almost
certainly have to be dispensed with.''
   Khomeini's designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri,
who has long urged wider freedoms, told Islamic students last
October: ``Freedom of expression ... is the natural and
constitutional right of every individual.
   ``The officials of this country and the revolution, who
experienced the bitter taste of repression under the monarchy,
should take notice of this and avoid the assumption we no longer
need freedom of expression.''
   Montazeri warned: ``Should we grow intolerant to challenges to
our ideas, these challenges will inevitably turn into bullets.''
   Parliament member Elias Hazrati declared during a debate on
postwar reconstruction and the future shape of society: ``Ten years
after the revolution, we have to bitterly admit that we have not
been successful in developing and reforming the systems we inherited
from the former regime.''
   Cleric Kermani noted in one of his columns: ``There are still
people who refuse to listen to the radio, watch television or
believe that women should not participate in marches and Friday
prayers, let alone Parliament.
   ``Some citizens are still heard complaining about the songs aired
on the radio and TV. They are against women appearing on television
as newscasters, interviewers and actresses and doubt the
advisability of consorting with foreign non-Moslems, infidels,
communists and women who do not wear the chador (cloaklike dress).''
   Khomeini said in a letter Oct.5 to Hojatoleslam Mohammad Hussein
Qadiri, a senior religious scholar at the Qom seminary who
questioned the ayatollah's ruling that chess and musical instruments
were permissible under Islamic law: ``According to your reverence's
interpretation of the hagiological tradition, modern civilization
should be destroyed and people should go back to mud huts or live in
deserts forever.''
   Khomeini urged Qadiri to ``avoid being affected by sanctimonious
and illiterate mullahs'' whom many Iranians criticize for burying
religion in inflexible tenets and medieval interpretations of the
Koran, Islam's holy book.
   Kermani noted that Khomeini's precepts are ``the start of a new
revolution in our deep-rooted ... traditional theology. ... Now is
the time to explicitly say that there must be a transformation, a
revolution in the way that the huge resources of the rich Shiite
theology are being exploited.''
   He said the brand of theology presented by backward-looking
clerics is ``not capable of managing a home or a village, let alone
a country!''
   Mohammad Hashemi, Rafsanjani's brother and head of the state-run
television and radio network, called in a November for greater media
freedom to air grievances and criticism of the government.
   Official action, he added, in an interview published by his
network's Soroush magazine, had prevented his organization from
``doing our duty in reflecting criticisms to the extent that our
mission requires.''
   Soroush also carried an interview with Mahdi Nasari,
editor-in-chief of Kayhan, Iran's largest selling newspaper, in
which he said the press has not done enough to criticize the
revolution's shortcomings.
   ``If a society is deprived of the blessing of criticism and
critical encounters ... throughout the mass media, then it can be
said that it is a society facing gradual death and at the very
least, decline,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Crashes of Aeroflot planes killed 85 people in
1988, far more than the previous year, the chief pilot for the
state-run airline said today.
   The pilot, Mikhail M. Tereshenko, announced the statistic at a
news conference to mark the 66th anniversary of the huge airline.
   He said the fatalities occurred in 16 crashes and that the death
toll did not include people killed in hijackings in 1988.
   In March, a family of 11 Siberian jazz musicians commandeered an
Aerflot plane flying from Siberia to Leningrad. They killed a flight
attendent and three passengers, and four hijackers committed suicide
after killing their mother, the Soviet press has reported.
   In 1987, Tereshenko said, 18 people died in 13 crashes.
   At a news conference in February 1988, Vladimir Y. Potemkin,
deputy chief of flight services, said 47 Aeroflot passengers and
crew members were killed in accidents in 1987. It was not
immediately clear why the figures are different.
   Aeroflot began releasing details of its safety record only last
year, another example of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
campaign for glasnost, or more openness on some issues.
   The campaign has also brought a flurry of reports and letters in
the official Soviet press complaining about Aeroflot.
   Boris E. Panyukov, first deputy civil aviation minister, said at
today's news conference there were 13 million ``unsatisfied people''
among Aeroflot's 124 million passengers in 1988. He did not give a
detailed breakdown.
   Aeroflot, which has a monopoly on domestic flights, is notorious
for delays and poor service.
   A Soviet newspaper reported last week that 120 angry Aeroflot
passengers refused to leave a plane for hours after they were told
to disembark before their destination.

   North Korean delegates today demanded a
halt to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises and told southern
delegates the maneuvers are blocking dialogue between North and
South.
   Delegates from both sides met nearly two hours in an attempt to
set down terms for the first meeting of their prime ministers. They
didn't agree on anything except the date for their next meeting _
March 2.
   The five-member delegations exchanged testy statements over North
Korea's demand for the halt to the annual U.S.-South Korea ``Team
Spirit'' exercises. North Korea says they are ``war preparations.''
   Each side accused the other of blocking progress.
   ``The South Korean side did not show sincerity at today's
meeting. We hope they will come to the next meeting with a sure
answer,'' North Korea's chief delegate, Paik Nam Jun, told reporters.
   South Korea's senior delegate, Song Han-ho, accused North Korea
of being insincere, saying: ``Their demand for a halt to the
exercises seems to be a precondition to dialogue.''
   Paik demanded soon after the meeting opened that the exercises be
halted. ``The exercises, which are heightening tension to an extreme
level and deepening distrust and misunderstanding, must be stopped
immediately and unconditionally.'' he said.
   ``The exercises are an obstacle to dialogue,'' he added.
   The North's official Pyongyang Radio said northern delegates will
boycott preliminary parliamentary talks, originally scheduled
Friday, until the exercises are over.
   The radio, monitored in Tokyo, quoted an unidentified North
Korean spokesman as saying the North wanted the question of stopping
the exercises on the talks' agenda and that holding the talks as
scheduled would be difficult since the exercises have already begun.
   Friday's scheduled talks were aimed at arranging full-scale
North-South parliamentary negotiations on such issues as a
non-aggression pact.
   Today's meeting was called to set the terms for a meeting of the
two nations' prime ministers for the first time since the division
of their land 44 years ago. The prime ministers' talks, if held,
would be the highest-level discussions between the two Koreas.
   The delegates exchanged handshakes with broad smiles before
starting the talks today, but the cordinal mood quickly dissipated.
   The chief South Korean negotiator said the joint exercises,
conducted annually since 1976, were defensive in nature and an
``inappropriate subject'' for discussion at the talks.
   He said the exercises could be modified or stopped if the leaders
of the two Koreas were to meet and resolve their basic differences.
   North Korea said it would not object to training exercises by
South Korean forces but did not want further joint U.S.-South Korea
maneuvers.
   Although there has been no official confirmation, this year's
exercises reportedly began last week. About 200,000 U.S. and South
Korean troops participated in last year's two-month exercise.

<TEXT>
   The Moscow-backed regime says it has
armed 30,000 supporters in Kabul and thousands more in outlying
towns so they can defend themselves against a guerrilla onslaught
when the Soviet pullout is complete.
   In Moscow, a Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday about 15,000
Soviet soldiers had been killed in Afghanistan, nearly 2,000 more
than the Kremlin reported in May, when the Soviets last gave a
figure.
   This indicated heavy losses during the withdrawal. But the
official, Yuri K. Alexeyev, said: ``It doesn't mean that during the
last months we had the bloodiest period of the war in Afghanistan.''
   An air crew in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, cited security
and refused to fly a jet transport packed with 32 tons of food and
medicine to begin the U.N. airlift to the besieged Afghan capital,
Kabul, U.N. officials said.
   With the deadline for a Soviet pullout only a week away, members
of the ruling party ``have been armed to defend their homes,''
neighborhoods and towns, Foreign Ministry spokesman Nabi Amani told
reporters Tuesday.
   ``Party members look on their weapons as their pride,'' he said.
   Amani said 45,000 additional party members who have finished
compulsory military service volunteered for reserve duty or for
self-defense and border units, including 5,000 women assigned to
non-combat units.
   President Najib told commanders of tribal and militia units
Tuesday that once the withdrawal of Soviet forces is complete, ``you
are now on your own feet defending your free-born and beloved
motherland,'' the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   It quoted Najib as saying ``extremist'' foes were not ready to
give up the ``selfish interest of themselves and their foreign
supporters.''
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told
reporters Tuesday that food supplies had improved in Kabul but the
fuel shortage was critical. Soviet aircraft are airlifting flour and
fuel to Kabul.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the $1.1 billion U.N. reconstruction
program for Afghanistan said today that the first plane scheduled in
the U.N. airlift would remain on the tarmac until at least Thursday.
   The crew of the chartered Egypt Air Boeing 707 ``called off the
flight ... for security reasons,'' said the official, Rene Albeck.
The plane was to leave Tuesday. ``Now we are working on the
possibility of having another airline do the job. We have not
dropped the idea of the airlift.''
   Sadruddin Aga Khan, the U.N. aid coordinator for Afghanistan, in
a statement from Geneva, expressed ``deep regret'' at Egypt Air's
decision and said the United Nations ``does not share the
apprehensions.''
   Moslem insurgents have agreed in principle not to attack U.N.
flights. The assurance was given in exchange for a promise that U.N.
convoys would carry supplies to guerrilla-held regions, U.N.
officials say.
   An estimated 350,000 people in Kabul's slums have little or no
food and fuel in one of the harshest winters in years. About 2
million residents and refugees crowd the capital, which is
surrounded by guerrillas.
   Afghanistan has been torn by civil war since a 1978 communist
coup prompted a Moslem insurgency. Soviet troops intervened a year
later, replacing one pro-Moscow regime with another.
   The Soviet withdrawal began May 15 and is to be complete by Feb.
15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. However, Kremlin officials say
all Soviet forces will be gone by the end of this week.
   About 1,000 Soviet soldiers remain in Kabul, guarding the airport.
   Guerrillas and many Western analysts predict Najib's government
will collapse soon after they withdraw. The president says his
conscript army is strong enough to defeat the insurgents.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet ballet troupe struggling to continue
its U.S. debut tour after its financial backers pulled out planned a
free performance tonight to thank those who have donated meals,
gifts and hotel rooms.
   The Donetsk Ballet tour announced Tuesday the young Ukrainian
dancers would take the stage again at the Lyric Opera House, where
they played to five small audiences last week during the first stop
of their 15-city tour.
   U.S. audiences had expected stars from well-known troupes such as
the Kirov Ballet to headline the tour, but when the stars weren't
allowed to leave the Soviet Union, investors withdrew $200,000,
stranding the dancers since last week.
   People touched by the dancers' plight have given them money,
cases of vodka and even a gold pinky ring sent by a man who called
himself ``an adoring ballet fan.''
   Robert M. Pomory, president of the Lyric Opera, said he would pay
the ballet company's hotel bill for two more days _ a contribution
of around $3,000 _ to guarantee the group's stay until Friday.
   ``I'm not going to put these kids on the street,'' said Pomory,
who moved into the hotel to watch over the dancers. ``If I had room
in my house I'd take them all home.''
   After a day of negotiations involving tour producer Jan Urdzik of
California-based Heart of the Art Inc., ``influential people from
New York,'' including producers, will attend tonight's program, he
said.
   In the meantime, the dancers _ most under the age of 25 _ watched
television, toured the city and practiced at the Baltimore School
for the Arts.
   ``Only I want tour to do,'' said Vadim Pisarev, the ballet's top
soloist.
   Pisarev, who celebrated his 24th birthday here, won the 1988
prize for best dancer in the Soviet Union and took home the gold
medal from the prestigious International Ballet Competition in
Jackson, Miss., in 1986.
   Despite his prominence in Soviet dance circles, Pisarev is not
well known to U.S. audiences.
   The dancers had been scheduled to go on to Detroit, Chicago, and
Columbus, Ohio, but their plans are now uncertain because of the
lack of financing.

   Charles Manson, serving a life term
for the 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and six others, faced
his seventh parole hearing today at San Quentin Prison.
   At his last hearing, three years ago, Manson told the panel that
he spent his time in prison making scorpion dolls with the power to
``torment,'' and he vowed to pursue violent world revolution if
freed.
   When another hearing was scheduled 10 years ago, Manson refused
to attend. Instead, he sent the parole board Monopoly money along
with a game card that read, ``Advance to Go, Collect $200.''
   Manson, 54, and several members of his so-called ``family'' of
followers were convicted in the Los Angeles slayings of the pregnant
Miss Tate, four of her guests and two other people in a separate
attack the following night.
   Prosecutors contended Manson ordered the killings to trigger a
race war that he believed was foretold in the Beatles' song ``Helter
Skelter.''

<HEAD>Study: Good Job, Income Doesn't Get Blacks Into Integrated Neighborhoods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No matter what level of income and education they
achieve, blacks aren't as readily accepted in white neighborhoods as
Hispanics and Asians, suggesting the American dream ``is not a
viable option for blacks,'' researchers say.
   Hispanics and Asians move easily into the U.S. mainstream as they
get more schooling, better jobs and higher income, according to the
study by two University of Chicago researchers in today's edition of
Social Science Quarterly.
   The study said figures show that ``integration is possible, even
likely, for all ethnic and racial groups except blacks.''
   It said an Asian or Hispanic who has completed the third grade is
more likely to live in an integrated neighborhood than a black with
a doctorate.
   And an Asian or Hispanic who makes less than $2,500 has a higher
chance of living in an integrated neighborhood than a black who
earns more than $50,000, the researchers found.
   ``The implications of these findings for blacks are troublesome,
given the civil rights legislation of recent decades,'' said Nancy
Denton, a demographer who worked on the study with sociology
professor Douglas Massey.
   ``The American dream of working one's way up is not a viable
option for blacks in the United States, at least in terms of
residence,'' she said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   ``No matter what their education or occupational achievements ...
blacks are exposed to higher crime rates, less effective educational
systems, higher mortality risks, more dilapidated surroundings and a
poorer socioeconomic environment than whites, simply because of the
persistence of strong barriers to residential integration,'' Denton
said in the study.
   She said the study is the first national one to compare
segregation patterns for three minority groups in the 20
metropolitan areas where each of the three minority groups has the
largest populations. It used data from the 1980 census, the first
with detailed statistics on American's growing Asian population.
   An earlier study on how social and economic status affects
segregation in ``typical'' U.S. neighborhoods found integration
improved modestly from 1970 to 1980.
   Michael White, a researcher at the Urban Institute in Washington
who worked on that study, said researchers came to the conclusion in
the 1950s and '60s that segregation wasn't substantially linked to
social-economic differences.
   He said that further studies, including Denton's, help policy
makers ``understand who is segregated, by how much and what are some
of the reasons for that.''
   The latest study said that although blacks' ability to integrate
rises as their socioeconomic status rises, the difference is
``generally trivial.''
   ``For blacks of all social backgrounds ... integration remains an
elusive goal,'' the study said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's blue-chip
stock portfolio already has prompted his withdrawal from several
cases and could disqualify him from participation in a broad range
of future issues.
   Thornburgh's holdings include stock in Amoco Corp., Atlantic
Richfield, General Motors, General Electric, IBM, International
Paper, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Mobil Corp.
   The financial disclosure report Thornburgh filed with the Office
of Government Ethics shows his stock portfolio contains holdings
from a cross-section of America's largest corporations.
   The list also includes Aluminum Company of America, Allied
Signal, Procter &amp; Gamble, Rockwell International and Sears Roebuck.
   Thornburgh's net worth was valued between $500,000 and $700,000
at the time of his confirmation last summer by the Senate, said
David Runkel, an aide to the attorney general.
   The extent and character of Thornburgh's investments have the
potential to disqualify him from participating in a number of major
decisions as cases arise, Runkel conceded.
   Any of the numerous companies in which Thornburgh holds stock
could become involved in dealings with the Justice Department as a
result of anti-pollution enforcement, government contracts,
antitrust investigations or merger reviews.
   Records kept by the attorney general's office show that
Thornburgh already has recused himself from several legal cases or
policy issues involving corporations in which he owns stock.
   Notably, Thornburgh issued a blanket recusal from any decisions
involving the continued enforcement of the AT&amp;T divestiture consent
decree because he owns at least $5,000 worth of the company's stock.
   Thornburgh is the third straight attorney general held ineligible
by department rules to play a role in the continued legal battles
resulting from the AT&amp;T breakup.
   William French Smith, who was President Reagan's first attorney
general, had been a director of Pacific Bell. Before taking office
in 1981, Smith and his wife placed their stock and bond holdings,
worth at least $2.3 million, into blind trusts.
   Smith's successor, Edwin Meese III, was criticized last month by
an internal Justice Department report for participating in AT&amp;T
policy discussions when he held stock in the Bell regional operating
companies.
   Before his confirmation, Thornburgh pledged to develop a recusal
policy and to survey the various Justice Department divisions to
identify any cases or issues that might pose a conflict of interest.
   He also agreed to resign as a corporate director of Rite Aid
Corp., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc., and ARCO Chemical Co.
   Under the recusal policy subsequently formulated, Thornburgh told
Justice Department officials that ``I will not participate in any
matter in which I am aware that I have a financial interest, unless
I have obtained a waiver of the disqualification.''
   Federal ethics law entitles officials to obtain the waivers, if
appropriate.
   But Runkel said Thornburgh has not sought any waivers, saying the
device ``would be used sparingly'' _ if at all.
   Thornburgh also recused himself from participating in the
antitrust division's review of Schindler Holding Corp.'s proposal to
buy the elevator manufacturing component of Westinghouse Electric
Corp.
   Thornburgh, who owns at least $15,000 worth of Westinghouse
stock, is also recused from participating in any litigation that
might arise from the cleanup of an Energy Department nuclear-weapons
plant in Fernald, Ohio, operated by Westinghouse.
   The attorney general also barred himself from participation in
decisions involving a longstanding lawsuit against the comptroller
of the currency for allowing Citicorp to acquire and operate a
municipal bond insurance company.
   The Justice Department successfully defended the lawsuit, filed
by an insurance trade association. Thornburgh owns at least $5,000
worth of Citicorp stock and holds at least $5,000 worth of notes
issued by the bank holding company.
   He is also recused from any discussions about whether the Food
and Drug Administration should involve itself in the implementation
of a California law requiring extensive notices of toxic chemicals
in consumer products and food.
   This recusal stems from Thornburgh's largest single holding _ a
block of stock in H.J. Heinz Co. worth more than $50,000.
   In addition, the attorney general has told Justice Department
officials he will consider recusing himself from matters that
involve his former Pittsburgh law firm, Kirkpatrick and Lockhart.
   Accordingly, Thornburgh has recused himself from any litigation
involving the Jan. 2, 1988 fuel-tank spill near Pittsburgh because
the law firm is representing Ashland Oil Co.
   Thornburgh has also recused himself from reviewing grant
applications from Harvard University, where his wife, Ginny, works
as the university's advocate for the handicapped.
   Before becoming attorney general, Thornburgh headed the Institute
of Politics at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.

<HEAD>L.A. Ban On Assault Rifles Draws Mixed Reviews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police officers, gang workers and a gang
member expressed skepticism that the city's ban on military-style
rifles will curb violence.
   The City Council on Tuesday unanimously voted to outlaw
immediately the sale or possession of semiautomatic weapons like the
AK-47 assault rifle that was used to kill five children in a
Stockton schoolyard Jan. 17.
   Mayor Tom Bradley called the weapons ``tools of murder and mayhem
whose sole purpose is killing human beings,'' and signed the measure
into law.
   Owners of such weapons have 15 days to either dispose of them or
render them inoperable. Violators face up to six months in jail and
a fine of up to $1,000.
   The law applies to any semiautomatic rifle that holds 20 or more
rounds or a semiautomatic shotgun that can be fired more than six
times.
   Rick ``Lil Loc 2'' Hardson, who identified himself as a member of
the Crips Four Trey gang, said the ban probably wouldn't deter gang
members from acquiring semiautomatic weapons. He said such guns can
be purchased on the street from drug addicts for as little as $30.
   As for gang members, ``They'll say, `Well, a gun is illegal. ...
So what?'... Everything they do is illegal,'' the 18-year-old said.
   Steve Valdivia, head of the city's Community Youth Gang Services,
said that he supports the new law but that assault rifles are not
used as frequently as other weapons in gang slayings.
   The director of Californians Against Handgun Violence praised the
ban. ``We think it's a terrific thing that they're doing,'' said
Luis Tolley. ``Even if it proves to be merely symbolic, it's still a
very important message.''
   Detective Jimmy L. Trahin called the ban an overreaction. ``If
they want to do something, don't attack the gun, attack the guy
who's using it in a crime,'' Trahin said.
   The Stockton City Council unanimously adopted an ordinance Monday
banning assault rifles, despite protests from gun owners who argued
that the measure was unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Study: Passengers in Non-Smoking Section Face Nicotine Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some airline passengers in non-smoking sections
breathe as much nicotine from cigarette smoke as those in smoking
sections, researchers say.
   A new study also said nicotine levels in older aircraft that
circulate fresh air are lower than in newer planes that recirculate
cabin air.
   The researchers, writing in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, studied nicotine levels in five passengers and
four flight attendants after four flights averaging four hours each.
   ``Air nicotine levels in the non-smoking areas that border the
smoking area may be at least as high as in similar indoor
environments frequented by smokers,'' wrote Margaret Mattson, a
National Cancer Institute researcher, and her colleagues.
   The maximum number of people smoking at any one time was eight,
and the average was around four, the researchers said.
   The subjects carried monitors that measured nicotine exposure
during the flight, and their urine was analyzed for nicotine content
for 72 hours after landing.
   Passengers in smoking sections were exposed to between 0.3 and
58.6 micrograms of nicotine per cubic meter of air, with a median of
12, the study said.
   Those sitting in the non-smoking section were exposed to between
0.1 and 71.0 micrograms per cubic meter, with a median of 2, the
study said.
   ``This bears out travelers' anecdotal observations that the
section in which one sits is often not as important in determining
exposure to smoke as is the environment generated by one's
neighbors,'' the researchers wrote.
   Two of the flights were on Boeing 727s, which circulate 100
percent fresh air, and two were on newer Boeing 767s, which
recirculate half their air.
   The researchers said passengers faced significantly less nicotine
exposure in the planes circulating only fresh air.

   Pope John Paul II marked Ash Wednesday by
warning Christians of hypocrisy and of falling for ideologies and
fads.
   In today's comments during his general audience, he said Lent, a
period of fasting and penitence before Easter, should bring a
``purification of the heart.''
   John Paul also observed Ash Wednesday, the opening day of Lent,
with an afternoon Mass at the 5th-century Saint Sabina Church.
   The pope said ``purification of the heart'' calls for pure
thoughts, intentions, desires and passions ``so that our external
behavior is really sincere and not the fruit of that hypocrisy and
`human glory' against which Christ was so severe.''
   ``The subtle temptation, for us Christians, is that of appearing
Christian without really being so, stooping to pacts with ideologies
and with the fads of this world,'' the pope told several thousand
pilgrims and tourists in Paul VI Auditorium.

   Gov. Guy Hunt and the manager of a state
pension fund that bought a TV station took their dispute over the
purchase into the station's studio today, with Hunt saying the deal
is a bad precedent.
   Hunt and David Bronner took seats in a studio of WSFA to be
interviewed on NBC's ``Today Show.''
   Bronner, who handled the $70 million purchase of WSFA for the
Retirement Systems of Alabama, said that it was a wise financial
move and that the TV station would be allowed to report the news
without state interference.
   Hunt said the acquisition of the capital's dominant commercial TV
station by a state-funded agency could set ``a dangerous
precedent,'' opening the door for government entities across the
country to take control of news media properties.
   Bronner, who oversees the investments of the $8 billion pension
fund, said he is considering the purchase of other news media
properties in Alabama and in other states. He said there is a
``great market'' for media acquisitions.
   The purchase is pending before the Federal Communications
Commission.
   Hunt has asked the FCC to delay transfer of the WSFA license
until legal issues in Alabama can be settled in the courts.

   Parade floats yielded to street-sweeping
machines and garbage trucks today as New Orleans sobered up from a
Mardi Gras tamed somewhat by the cold.
   For many, the onset of Lent today did not stop the partying from
continuing inside the bistros in the French Quarter, safe from the
near-freezing weather that kept Mardi Gras attendance below the
expected 1.7 million people.
   ``I love New Orleans and Mardi Gras is the most wonderful thing
on earth!'' Kerri Rock, 27, shouted late Tuesday night over the din
in Ryan's 500 Pub on Bourbon Street.
   Miss Rock said her costume was a nun's habit _ and the results
were startling.
   ``I've never had so many invitations from men wanting to go out
with me. It's disgusting,'' she said.
   One parade-goer was shot to death during a Sunday night holdup,
the only violent crime reported during the final weekend of
Carnival, said police spokesman John Bryson.
   Bryson said the only other casualties were a woman who broke the
fall of a rider who fell from his float and two people struck by the
prized gilded coconuts tossed by the Zulu marching society.
``Nothing serious,'' he said.
   Attendance figures were not immediately available.
   The partying officially ended at midnight when street-sweeping
machines, preceded by mounted police, purged the French Quarter.
   Each year the city weighs the collected garbage to help measure
attendance; city officials plan to release this year's figures in
the next day or two.
   Twelve parades with more than 400 floats rolled through New
Orleans and its suburbs, witnessed by well-insulated, but
enthusiastic crowds.
   Clarinetist Pete Fountain and his Half-Fast Marching Club helped
launch the celebrating on historic St. Charles Avenue, followed by
floats carrying Zulus _ black-faced black men spoofing Carnival high
society _ and Rex, monarch of Mardi Gras.
   Floats seemed to move swifter than usual through the streets as
riders tossed doubloons, plastic beads and other Carnival souvenirs
to the crowds.
   To squelch one trend, the City Council earlier this year forbade
the throwing of mice and other live animals from Carnival floats.
   Costumes ranged from the bizarre and immodest _ men in lingerie
and bare-breasted women _ to the more traditional families of clowns
and clusters of cockroaches. People blamed temperatures that ranged
from the high 20s to about 45 degrees for this year's scant supply
of bare flesh.
   ``This one's been a little too cold, but it's still been a lot of
fun. We're drinking whisky to keep us warm,'' said Barbara Rusina, a
French Quarter resident who was partying with Miss Rock.

   Coup leader Gen. Andres Rodriguez has
moved to bolster his new government by replacing about 50 military
officers, including commanders of the three army corps, with people
of his own choice.
   Rodriguez deposed President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner in a bloody
coup Friday and was sworn in as president. He then dissolved
Congress and called national elections May 1.
   Stroessner, who had ruled the country 34 years, has been exiled
to Brazil, and his name is being expunged from many civic monuments.
He said Tuesday he would spend the rest of his life in Brazil.
   Leaders of four opposition parties say they need more time to
organize for the elections, but government leaders rejected such
appeals.
   ``The national constitution sets the time allowed'' to choose a
permanent successor to Stroessner, Foreign Minister Luis Maria
Argana said. ``And we already have given the maximum allowed.''
   Critics disagreed.
   The government ``always cites the constitution when it is
convenient for them,'' said Euclides Acevedo, president of the
left-leaning Revolutionary Febrerista Party.
   The opposition parties, three of which werblication.
The weekly, which criticized and ridiculed the Stroessner regime,
was closed by the government in August 1987.
   Stroessner, 76, told a news conference Tuesday in Brazil that he
would spend the rest of his life there because it ``received me with
kindness and hospitality.'' He is living temporarily in the remote
interior city of Itumbiara, 270 miles southeast of Brasilia, the
capital.
   As many as 300 people reportedly died in last week's coup, but
Rodriguez has said the dead and wounded together did not exceed 50.

<HEAD>600 Soldiers Smash Windows of Parliament in Wage Dispute</HEAD>

   Hundreds of soldiers today
smashed windows of Parliament and overturned cars after Parliament
granted them their first pay raise since 1975 but gave them less
than they wanted.
   Witnesses said 600 soldiers assaulted bystanders and stole
cameras from journalists covering the demonstration. No figures on
injuries were available.
   ``I was surrounded by a bunch of soldiers who cuffed me about the
head with the branch from a tree,'' Ian Vallance, a Port
Moresby-based correspondent told The Associated Press. ``I was
kicked, I was threatened. It was very scary.''
   The riot occurred after the government agreed to raise soldiers'
pay 72 percent but said the increase would be phased in over three
years. The soldiers, who receive about $50 a week, wanted the full
raise immediately.
   Vallance said in a telephone interview that about half of
Parliament's ground floor windows were broken, and ``windows up to
the fourth floor were smashed with rocks.'' AAP reported earlier
that the troops had not been given a pay increase since independence
in 1975.
   The soldiers defied orders to return to their barracks and police
fired tear gas to disperse them, according to local radio.
   They finally dispersed after Deputy Prime Minister Akoka Doi
promised the government would reconsider the size of the raise.
   Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu was out of town at the time but was
reported flying back to the capital because of the riot.
   Papua New Guinea, a former U.N. territory administered by
Australia, has about 3.5 million inhabitants. It occupies the east
half of New Guinea island and nearby islands in the southwest
Pacific.

<HEAD>Controversial Moslem Chief Resigns in Central Asia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Soviet Union's huge Moslem
population in Central Asia resigned after residents accused him of
not attending prayers, a source reported today.
   Zamalityen Buranov, a teacher at the Islamic seminary in Bukhara,
Uzbekistan, said the religious leader had generated considerable
controversy.
   ``Not everyone respected him,'' Buranov said in a telephone
interview from the seminary, the Mir-Arab Madrasah. ``People don't
like him. They say he doesn't go to prayers.''
   Buranov said the resignation of Shamsuddin Babakhan, the
50-year-old chairman of the Islamic Board of Central Asia and
Kazakhstan, had been demanded at a demonstration on Friday.
   The official news agency Tass reported Saturday that more than
200 Moslems marched from a mosque through the Uzbek capital,
Tashkent, and ``put forth demands concerning questions of their
religious organizations.'' It did not specify the demands.
   Tass reported Tuesday that the ruling body of the Islamic board
had accepted Babakhan's resignation and appointed Mukhammadsadyk
Mamayusupov, 36, to take over his duties temporarily. He currently
is head of the Islamic Institute in Tashkent, Tass said.
   An estimated 45 million to 50 million Moslems live in the Soviet
Union, making them the largest minority after ethnic Russians. Their
number is growing more rapidly than ethnic Russians who hold the
reins of political power.
   The Kremlin has expressed concern that Islamic fundamentalism
across its borders with Afghanistan and Iran could spread to Soviet
Moslems.
   When he ordered Soviet troops into Afghanistan in December 1979,
Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev said he wanted to counter what
he described as Western efforts to create a foyer of Moslem
fundamentalism at the Soviet Union's doorstep.
   The Soviet troop withdrawl from Afghanistan is nearly complete.

   At least one Palestinian prisoner was killed and
14 were injured today when army guards fired tear gas, plastic
bullets and live ammunition to quell a riot in a military prison,
army sources said.
   A Palestinian teen-ager was reported shot to death today in the
occupied lands, and a Palestinian died of injuries suffered earlier
in the uprising.
   Israeli government and military officials rejected the
conclusions of a U.S. State Department report alleging substantial
human rights violations and said the report ignored the context of
the uprising.
   The U.S. report, released Tuesday, says methods used by the army
to halt the 14-month revolt have resulted in ``many avoidable deaths
and injuries.''
   Army sources, who insisted on anonymity, said the unrest at the
military prison in Megiddo, in northern Israel, began outside when
visiting relatives went on a rampage, raising Palestinian flags and
stoning soldiers' parked cars.
   When guards suspended visiting hours, inmates began rioting, the
sources said. ``As prisoners returned to cells, they stirred up
others and a serious riot started inside the cells, which is still
continuing,'' the sources said.
   They said military guards fired tear gas and plastic bullets to
try to end the rioting. When that failed, the guards opened fire
with live ammunition, they said, resulting in the death and injuries.
   An army official later said the riot was brought under control
and an investigation was begun.
   In the West Bank village of Kabatiya, Arab hospital officials
said 16-year-old Jamal Salim Zakarni died after being shot in the
stomach during a clash with troops. A military spokeswoman said she
was checking the report.
   The army confirmed the death of 20-year-old Akram Abu Nahla, a
resident of the Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip who died in a
Tel Aviv hospital.
   A military spokeswoman said the circumstances of the death were
not clear. A Gaza City reporter said Abu Nahla was shot in the head
with a plastic bullet Tuesday during a demonstration.
   The three deaths raised to 377 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began Dec. 7, 1987. Fifteen Israelis have died.
   ``In spite of the constant provocations, the Israel Defense Force
scrupulously maintains moral norms and human rights, and treats any
exceptions with utmost severity,'' the Foreign Ministry said in
reponse to the State Department's annual report on human rights
worldwide.
   ``The report does not take into consideration the overall context
of the events and continuing provocations. The extreme elements ...
directing the events use violence meant to be lethal,'' the
statement said.
   The report alleged that Israel's response to the uprising ``led
to a substantial increase in human rights violations.''
   ``Soldiers frequently used gunfire in situations that did not
present mortal danger to troops, causing many avoidable deaths and
injuries,'' it said.
   It also said troops often arrest Palestinians without warrants
and demolish houses of people suspected, but not convicted, of
anti-Israeli violence.
   Yossi Sarid, a Parliament member of the liberal Citizens Rights
Movement, said the report was generally accurate.
   ``I am so sorry that in order to see our face we need a mirror
held from so far away,'' he said on Israel radio.
   Jonathan Kuttab, co-founder of the human rights monitoring group
Al Haq-Law in the Service of Man, said he hoped the U.S. government
would reassess its $3 billion annual aid to Israel in light of the
findings. ``It's a matter of American dollars not going to a country
that systematically violates human rights,'' said Kuttab, a
Palestinian-American lawyer.
   But the military chief prosecutor, Brig. Gen. Amnon Strashnov,
told Israeli Television the report was ``exaggerated and unjust.''
   Strashnov said that of 21,000 Palestinians arrested since the
start of the uprising, 8,000 have been indicted. Of those, 4,300
have been been convicted and 200 acquitted, Strashnov said. Others
were awaiting trial, he said.
   He said about 50 Israeli soldiers have been tried or are facing
prosecution for violating army orders.

<HEAD>Kentucky University Tones Down Smoking Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Louisville has softened
its proposed no-smoking rules, bowing to threats of budgetary
reprisals from legislators in a state where tobacco is a $2 billion
industry.
   University President Donald Swain said Tuesday the new policy,
which takes effect March 1, abandons a provision that all
``irreconcilable'' conflicts between smokers and non-smokers be
resolved in favor of non-smokers.
   The original policy on smoking was drafted last fall but never
went into effect at the university, where 22,000 students are
enrolled. Some legislators had threatened the university with a loss
in state support.
   ``We've tried to address all concerns, including those of the
legislators,'' Swain said.
   ``There was concern within the university that smokers be treated
with some balance. We were concerned that the previous policy was a
little one-sided.''
   Swain said the revised policy directs department heads to discuss
and settle conflicts with employees.
   The policy also drops a ban on smoking in open work areas,
directing instead that such areas be separated into smoking and
non-smoking areas or be designated one or the other after
discussions with the affected employees.
   State Rep. Donnie Gedling, chairman of the Legislature's Tobacco
Task Force and an outspoken opponent of the university's earlier
proposal, said of the changes, ``I could live with that without any
problem.''
   ``If it's fair to smokers, that's what we want to look at,'' he
said.
   Another key legislator, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Clay
Crupper, said any smoking policy was inappropriate for a public
institution in a tobacco-growing state. ``I didn't think they needed
any regulation,'' he said.
   Kentucky, the nation's top burley tobacco producer, had the
country's highest smoking-related death rate in 1985, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control reported in November.

   Israeli troops and allied militiamen
surrounded a south Lebanon village today and deprived its Moslem
inhabitants of food for refusing to cooperate with the
Israeli-sponsored local administration, a U.N. source said.
   The source said armored personnel carriers, troops and militiamen
of the South Lebanon Army besieged Shibaa, in Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone,'' at 6 a.m.
   The source from the U.N. peacekeeping force, who demanded
anonymity, said: ``They are stopping cars and trucks carrying food''
and preventing them from entering the village.
   About 7,000 people, most of them Sunni Moslems, live in Shibaa.
   The nine-nation, 5,800-man U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon polices
a buffer that overalps with the security zone, which Israel set up
in 1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its army from Lebanon. The
security zone is designed to prevent raids into Israel by
Lebanese-based guerrillas.
   Shibaa is in the Norwegian battalion's zone of operations.
   A Norwegian officer, who refused to give his name, said 12
members of his battalion were dispatched to the village to ``study
the condition of the people and see what we can do to help.''
   The other UNIFIL source said the peacekeepers' humanitarian
officer, Col. Sepeeo Elva of Finland, flew by helicopter to Shibaa
from UNIFIL headquarters in the border town of Naqoura.
   Israeli troops and South Lebanon Army militia expelled 40
Lebanese from Shibaa last month for refusing to cooperate with local
administration, which Israel set up to handle day-to-day affairs in
the absence of government authority in the security belt.
   At least 30 others have been deported this year from other
Lebanese villages in the security zone.

   A New York-bound jet with 269 people aboard
lost an engine cover in flight and returned to Los Angeles as a
precaution, Pan Am said.
   ``There was no impact on safety whatsoever,'' Pan Am spokesman
Alan Loflin said of the Boeing 747 that left Los Angeles
International Airport on Tuesday.
   The detachable engine cover, or cowling, dented the landing gear
door and caused minor damage to the underside of the wing before
falling onto the runway, he said. Crew members were informed by
passengers who were looking out the windows, he said.
   ``Cowling separating from an engine isn't an everyday occurrence,
but it's not uncommon,'' Loflin said. ``It doesn't affect the way it
flies.''
   The cause of the mishap was under investigation.

<TEXT>
   Turkeys trotting into traffic and chasing
humans near Plymouth Rock are giving state officials problems the
Pilgrims never dreamed of.
   Wildlife workers trying to restore the wild turkey population
that has been a part of state lore since the first Thanksgiving say
tame turkeys are becoming a nuisance in the suburbs and threaten to
dilute the wild breeding stock.
   ``One chased an old lady at a bird feeder. Some others got onto
Route 128 and almost caused an automobile accident,'' James Cardoza,
head of the state's wild turkey restoration project, said Tuesday.
   Richard Turner said he received a complaint from the owner of a
Mercedes who found a turkey trotting over the hood and roof of his
expensive car.
   Turner said the birds are apparently pen-raised wild turkeys that
have been freed and don't have the wily instincts of their wild
counterparts.
   Although it is illegal, chicks are sometimes sold at county fairs
and ``unsupecting people have bought them thinking it would be nice
to have some wild turkeys in their yard,'' Turner said.
   The problem, according to the biologists, is that the pen-reared
turkeys could breed with the wild turkeys the state is trying to
reintroduce to areas south of Boston.
   In other words, they say, the wild turkeys could become just as
dumb as the tame turkeys.
   Cardoza estimated that the population of tame turkeys on the
loose was less than 50.
   The state's wild turkey restoration effort began in 1972 with the
release in the Berkshires of a few pairs of wild birds captured in
New York. Since then, the number of wild turkeys in the state's
western mountains has grown to about 5,000.
   For the past nine years, the birds have been numerous enough in
some areas to allow hunting.

   Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F.
Powell Jr. has developed pneumonia and will remain hospitalized
several more days, a medical center spokeswoman said today.
   The 81-year-old Powell, whose pneumonia was discovered through
chest X-rays and a low-grade fever late Tuesday, is being treated
with antibiotics and remains in good condition with no respiratory
distress, said Cindy Hamilton, a Baptist Medical Center spokeswoman.
   ``The new findings do not change his excellent prognosis or imply
any deterioration. Rather, they are part of an evolutionary
progression in a respiratory illness,'' said Dr. Joel Schrank, chief
of cardiology and Powell's physician.
   The justice, who was in Jacksonville as a member of a panel of
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, was taken to the hospital
Monday after becoming dizzy.
   Powell passed a second day in the hospital Tuesday walking the
halls, taking phone calls and undergoing a battery of tests. Ms.
Hamilton described him as ``our most popular patient.''
   Powell retired from the high court in 1987, citing health
concerns as one reason. He had suffered from prostate cancer. He has
since participated in a number of cases for the Richmond-based 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   He was nominated to the court by President Nixon in 1971,
replacing Hugo L. Black.

   North Korea and Cuba are the world worst
violators of human rights because they have established systems of
``total repression,'' a top State Department official said today.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Schifter offered that
assessment on the occasion of the release of the State Department's
annual human rights report, which strikes a positive note about the
Soviet Union but harsh criticism about Israel.
   Schifter, who heads the State Department's human rights bureau,
said under questioning that his assessment, consistent with previous
years, is that Cuba and North Korea are the world's most repressive
states.
   ``What we are talking about here is total repression,'' Schifter
said.
   In North Korea, he said, the government ``tries really to turn
people into automatons.''
   ``As far as Cuba is concerned, there is an effort there to try to
achieve the same thing in terms of total penetration of the country
by secret police truly spying on every citizen,'' he said.
   The human rights report's section on the Soviet Union said
President Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms offer ``cautious hope for a
better day.''
   But it says the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip led to a ``substantial increase'' in human rights violations
by Israeli authorities last year.
   It said the actions of Israeli authorities ``resulted in many
avoidable deaths'' among Palestinians since they began their
uprising 14 months ago. Since the December 1987 start of the
uprising, 374 Palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded,
most by Israeli army gunfire.
   In Jerusalem, Israel rejected key conclusions of the report and
said it ignored the context of a violent civilian uprising by
Palestinians.
   A Foreign Ministry statement disputed the report's claim that
soldiers who opened fire unnecessarily on Arabs were given lenient
sentences and in some cases not punished at all.
   ``In spite of the constant provocations, the Israel Defense Force
scrupulously maintains moral norms and human rights, and treats any
exceptions with utmost severity,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said.
   Discussing the Soviet Union, the report cited Gorbachev's
policies of glasnost and perestroika _ aimed at encouraging public
discussion of national problems and the restructuring of the
stagnant government and economy _ with achieving ``a major impact''
on the communist system.
   But it also pointed out that ``powerful and pervasive'' forces
are at work to defeat Gorbachev's reforms and that ``individual
guarantees to protect the rights of the individual against unbridled
state authority are still needed.''
   The report, which was released Tuesday, said it is premature to
contend that a ``fundamental shift'' in Soviet policy has occurred,
but added that ``the changes in evidence in 1988 have profound
implications, as advocates of significant systemic reform appear to
have gained strength.''
   The report said prisoners detained on religious or political
grounds have been released and that plans for the amendment or
repeal of statutes limiting activities in these areas have been
announced.
   In addition, freedom the leave the Soviet Union temporarily has
been expanded, it said. It cited increased emigration for Armenians,
ethnic Germans, Jews and Pentecostals.
   ``Plans have been adopted for elections which, though not
completely free and open, are no longer to be the farce they have
been heretofore,'' the report said.
   As ``the most significant development,'' the report noted that
the abuse of psychiatry has been made a punishable offense and that
mental hospitals have been far less likely to confine persons for
political or religious reasons.
   ``The recognition of the need for action to secure the rights of
individuals, and the fact that the defects of the existing system
are, now openly discussed, offer a basis for cautious hope of a
better day,'' the report said.
   The State Department has been issuing the annual reports since
the mid-1970s. This year's survey covers conditions in 169 countries
and territories.
   The report pointed to severe human rights setbacks in Iraq and
the African countries of Burundi and Sudan.
   In Iraq, chemical warfare was used against Kurdish rebels,
killing or injuring thousands and forcing thousands more to flee the
country, it said. Overall, the country has an ``abysmal human rights
record,'' the report said.
   The report indicated that perhaps the single greatest
rights-related tragedy in the world occurred in southern Sudan where
it said some reports estimated that between 100,000 and 250,000
civilians died of starvation.
   The deaths occurred after elements of the armed forces on each
side in Sudan's civil war interfered with or failed to cooperate
with food delivery efforts.
   On the positive side, the report said there were significant
steps toward democracy and human rights protection in South Korea,
Taiwan and Pakistan. It also said that the October plebiscite in
Chile has raised hopes for a peaceful return to democracy there.

   The AIDS epidemic will extend well into the
next century, and to combat it America must conduct extensive sex
surveys, provide sex education in plain language and distribute
condoms widely, according to a study released today.
   The study by the National Research Council says the nation's war
against acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the virus that
causes it, human immunodeficiency virus, is handicapped by outdated
data on the sex habits of Americans and by poor studies on precisely
how many people now carry the AIDS virus.
   The study said public health authorities have a ``pressing
national need'' for statistics gathered in a variety of surveys,
including AIDS blood tests from a wide segment of the population,
such as newborns and women seeking abortions, and for well-designed
studies of homosexuals, prostitutes and intravenous drug users, some
of the major risk groups for the disease.
   America, the study said, faces a long, difficult battle against
the AIDS virus and that effort will continue even after a cure is
found.
   ``The struggle to retard the spread of HIV is likely to persist
well into the next century,'' the study said. ``Improved
understanding and prevention of the behaviors that spread HIV@AIDS
will be needed _ not only in the short run ... but in the decades
that follow any medical breakthrough as well.''
   It also noted: ``HIV is already substantially seeded in the U.S.
population _ the number of people who are now infected may surpass 1
million _ and the virus is likely to continue to spread, if not in
epidemic form, then in a persistent, more stable endemic form.''
   Lincoln E. Moses, chairman of the committee that produced the
report, told a news conference that ``AIDS is likely to kill more
than 50,000 Americans in the year 1991, placing it among the top
causes of death for people under 40.''
   ``Our committee believes that the public health threat posed by
AIDS is so great that we must find ways to overcome social and
cultural taboos that stand in the way of improved AIDS prevention,
and we must do so quickly,'' he said.
   The director of the AIDS study, Charles F. Turner, said
information about American sexual behavior is outdated and
unreliable.
   ``To cause people to change what they do requires an
understanding about how people think about sex,'' he said. ``The
historical understanding of sexual information in this country is
severely lacking. There is a great need for information on sexual
behavior of all types because we now have virtually no data.''
   The 589-page study includes scores of recommendations aimed at
gathering information on how AIDS is spread, as well as the use and
effectiveness of behavior modification programs.
   Among the recommendations:
   _Blood tests for AIDS among all babies born in the U.S., and
among women seeking abortions at clinics.
   _``Vigorous programs'' of research into American sexual habits,
including sex outside of marriage, between people of the same
gender, with people of both genders, with prostitutes, and
``variations in sexual techniques among the various types of sexual
partnerings.'' It also said the sexual habits of people who inject
drugs should be studied.
   _Expanded programs to teach ``safe injection'' techniques to drug
users. Needle-sharing among drug users is thought to be a major way
in which AIDS is spread.
   _That condoms be ``readily available to all sexually active
persons'' and that a study be conducted to determine how effective
condoms and spermicides are in lowering the risk of HIV infection.
   _That sex education on preventing AIDS be ``available in clear,
explicit language in the idiom of the target audience.''
   _That treatment be available for all sexually transmitted
diseases which are thought to speed the spread of AIDS.
   _That television networks provide more public service messages on
methods of avoiding AIDS, and that they accept condom advertisements.
   AIDS is a disease that destroys the body's immune system and its
ability to fight infection. Patients usually die of infections or
cancers.
   The disease is usually spread through sexual contact, but also
through contact with blood, blood products or from a pregnant woman
to her child.
   Most of the victims in the U.S. are homosexuals or intravenous
drug users, but the disease has been spread through heterosexual
contact, contaminated blood transfusions, and from mother to newborn.

   Californians grabbed their cameras to capture a rare snowfall
from the beaches of Malibu to the streets of Palm Springs today,
while a slight warming trend held out the promise of a return to a
normal winter in much of the nation.
   Some Los Angeles suburbs closed schools after getting up to 2
inches of snow, but there was little opportunity for surfers to
build snowmen in the sand.
   ``Every once in a while the wind blows some flakes down here on
the beach,'' said Bill Gould, who works at a gas station in Malibu.
   ``Snow, snow, snow and lots of snow!'' said Los Angeles Police
Officer Bill Vaughn, who was in the San Fernando Valley 20 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles. ``Everybody's rolling out their
Polaroids and taking pictures of it.''
   After more than a week of record cold in the lower 48 states,
warmer temperatures today gave fruit farmers and others something to
cheer about.
   ``The freeze-a-thon is over,'' the National Weather Service
declared in San Antonio, Texas.
   ``It does seem to be a trend,'' agreed meteorologist Bob Johns at
the weather service's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City,
Mo.
   ``It looks like we'll continue to have cold temperatures but it
doesn't look like it'll be as extreme.''
   Not that spring is just around the corner. Temperatures today in
most places were only slightly higher than those Tuesday, when
records were set in dozens of cities.
   The record-breaking cold continued in several cities, including
Boise, Idaho, with minus 10 degrees; Ely, Nev., minus 22, and
Sacramento, Calif., 23 degrees. Salt Lake City's minus 7 tied its
record for the date.
   The bitter cold was expected to linger in Colorado particularly,
where it was 35 below zero early today in the town of Craig. And
more cold weather came calling from Canada, moving into the northern
Plains on Tuesday and hitting the Great Lakes with strong wind and
near-blizzard conditions.
   ``It's just terrible,'' said Dan Luna, a meteorologist for the
National Weather Service in Marquette, Mich. ``We just now recorded
a gust of wind up to 45 miles per hour.''
   At least 89 deaths have been attributed to the weather since Jan.
31, when bitter arctic air from Alaska made its way into the lower
48 states. In one such death Tuesday, an elderly woman who had more
than $5,000 stashed in her plywood shack in Laredo, Texas, died of
hypothermia.
   In Idaho, where as many as 1,600 cattle and sheep have died in
towering snow drifts, National Guardsmen in helicopters flew over
the countryside to help ranchers search for surviving livestock. Few
were found.
   But in one indication of a thaw, the temperature in Fairbanks,
Alaska, climbed above zero Tuesday for the first time in 26 days.
   ``It's been quite a while,'' Fairbanks meteorologist John Lingaas
said. He predicted that the mercury, which hit 8 above Tuesday,
would be into the 20s by Thursday.
   Low temperatures in much of California climbed back above
freezing early today, ending the crisis for the state's
multibillion-dollar agriculture industry.
   Still, farmers said the freeze has already caused serious damage
to some citrus crops, prompting increases in the wholesale price of
oranges.
   ``The lemon crop in the San Joaquin Valley may have been
obliterated,'' said Richard Pescosolido, farm manager for Sequoia
Orange Co. in Exeter.
   Washington state's $2.7 million apricot crop, the nation's second
largest, was badly damaged by the cold, county extension agents
said, and the state's winter wheat crop remains threatened. But in
Texas' Rio Grande Valley, citrus growers said damage to their crops
was light.
   ``We really came through very well,'' said Ray Prewett, executive
director of Texas Citrus Mutual, a McAllen-based growers'
organization. ``It'll take a few days to make a final determination,
but it looks good.''
   Still, all was not balmy in Texas. Houston today broke its
all-time record of 110 consecutive hours of freezing temperatures. A
28-degree reading pushed the record to 111 hours, but the
temperature rose above freezing an hour later to end the streak.
   Homeless people continued to flock to shelters in San Francisco,
although they, too, were cheered by the prospect of slightly less
chilling weather. The city's temperature early today was 40 degrees.
   ``I'm thrilled out of my mind that it's going to be just a little
less cold, even though it's not exactly going to warm up,'' said
Jason Derick, 33, a homeless man who planned to spend the night in a
cubicle at San Francisco's Civic Center.
   There were reports of homeless people being turned away from
overflowing shelters in Las Vegas, which on Tuesday had its coldest
February day ever with a low of 16 degrees. Ice formed in the
fountains at Caesars Palace.
   Further north, in Reno, more than 400 people crowded into
shelters to escape record lows of 16 below zero. ``We took in more
people than we were supposed to,'' said Salvation Army Capt. Kenneth
Osbourn. ``We can't turn anybody out in this kind of weather.''
   In New Orleans, officials said cold weather on Fat Tuesday held
down the Mardi Gras crowd to somewhat below the expected 1.8
million. People also blamed the weather for this year's scant supply
of bare flesh.
   ``This one's been a little too cold, but it's still been a lot of
fun,'' said French Quarter resident Barbara Rusina. ``We're drinking
whiskey to keep warm.''

<HEAD>Study: Closing Wage Gap But Poverty Increasingly Female Phenomenon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Working women earn only 65 percent of
men's wages but are gaining ground, according to a Rand Corp. survey
released today.
   Although the wage gap is rapidly narrowing, an increasing
percentage of the poor are women, according to the study by
economists James P. Smith and Michael Ward.
   Poverty was ``sex neutral'' in 1940, when more than 90 percent of
all families included a husband and wife. But by 1980, 62 percent of
poor adults were women, the study said.
   ``With the rising incidence of unwed parenting and divorce, the
fraction of female-headed families rose and did so at an accelerated
rate after 1960,'' the authors said.
   ``By 1980, women headed almost one in seven families, almost 70
percent more than in 1960. This problem reached epidemic proportions
among blacks, where now more than four out of every 10 families are
headed by women.''
   The study found that between 1980 and 1986, wages for working
women increased from 60 percent of men's wages to 65 percent. They
estimated that women would make at least 74 percent of men's wages
by 2000.
   The study, which surveyed wages and skill levels in American
women since 1920, was published in the February issue of The Journal
of Economic Perspective and was funded by the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development.
   The authors based their findings on figures from the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, the Office of Federal Contract
Compliance Program and U.S. census forms.
   Smith directs the Labor and Population Program at Rand, a
think-tank focusing on national security and domestic welfare
issues. Ward is an economist at Unicon Research Corp. in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Weather is Greater Threat to Energy System Than Terrorists, Panel
Told</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 10 grafs new with today's testimony; picks up 3rd graf pvs,
In many cases.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Weather is a greater threat to the nation's
energy system than the possibility of terrorist attacks, an industry
official told a Senate panel today.
   Utilities and the Department of Energy have initiated a security
program to protect the nation's electrical distribution system, but
``skepticism was rampant'' among planners that a multi-site
terrorist attack ever would be carried out against U.S. electric
facilities, said Michael R. Gent, president of the North American
Electric Reliability Council.
   He told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that the
dependability and resilience of the nation's energy system ``has
been amply demonstrated.''
   Gent said hurricanes could cause more damage than terrorists,
``and we've shown we can handle hurricanes.''
   Another witness before the committee, which was concluding two
days of hearings on the vulnerability of U.S. telecommunications and
energy resources to terrorism, said there had been 283 documented
cases of sabotage against American energy systems since 1980.
   But Robert K. Mullen, a terrorism expert, said he saw no evidence
of an increasing terrorist threat in the United States and that most
previous acts of sabotage have been aimed at individuals who own or
operate service stations or other retail facilities.
   ``Very little of what goes on with regard to energy sabotage in
pre-industrial nations is comparable to what occurs in the United
States,'' Mullen said in reference to increased sabotage activities
in other parts of the world.
   ``There are no indicators of which I am aware...that would
suggest to me the threat to energy assets here is substantially
different from what the recent historical record indicates,'' Mullen
said.
   In testimony Tuesday, the committee was told that the increasing
high-tech nature of the U.S. telecommunications systems and a trend
towards centralization of facilities was making the networks more
vulnerable to terrorist attack.
   The government is ill-equipped to deal with such attacks, which
could be carried out with conventional weapons, or even computers,
by as few as a half-dozen assailants, a committee investigator said
following a yearlong investigation.
   ``In many cases, the consequences appear to be manageable; in a
few cases, the consequences are potentially catastrophic,'' Charles
C. Lane, a committee investigator, told a committee hearing.
   The Associated Press this week reported that the Energy
Department was quietly advising U.S. companies of a growing threat
of terrorist attack on vital domestic energy facilities and that it
was pressing them to fortify their defenses.
   An internal DOE report obtained by the AP said it was possible
that potential Third World adversaries ``could sponsor attacks on
the energy infrastructure in the U.S.''
   It was learned that a special interagency task force has been
created within the National Security Council to assess the
vulnerability of U.S. energy systems and to study ways of minimizing
the risk of supply disruptions caused by ``techno-terrorism.''
   Lane said that while U.S. energy and telecommunications systems
are robust and often redundant, they are vulnerable to multi-site
terrorist attacks. And while the government is prepared to handle a
major national security emergency, ``there are no programs designed
specifically'' to deal with a telecommunications disaster.
   The committee hearings are being held to study how well the
federal government and industry are organized to repel attacks and
sustain and repair vital energy, telecommunications and
transportation sources.
   John C. McDonald, who chaired a National Research Council
committee that investigated the vulnerability of the nation's
telecommunications system, told the committee that because
long-distance networks rely upon ``a very limited number of signal
transfer points, a few well-placed hand grenades would crash major
portions of the domestic long-distance networks.''
   But other witnesses were less alarmist about the effects of such
attacks. Benham E. Morriss, deputy manager of the government's
National Communications System, said he was ``not complacent'' about
the dangers, but added: ``I think the statements that have been made
are vastly overstated.''
   Morriss acknowledged that the consequences today of
communications disruptions can be much greater than in the past,
``But I don't think from a national security point of view we've
gotten into a worse situation.''
   Thomas A. Norman, representing the recently created National
Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, said the
industry-government panel did not ``share the degree of concern'' of
the other witnesses at the hearing.
   Norman said the trend to more diversity in the telecommunications
industry is good for national security and that technology advances
are ``making detection of troubles and restoration of our network
even faster than ... in the old days.''
   But McDonald said increasing dependence on new technology such as
fiber optics and computer software and a trend towards
centralization of facilities increases vulnerability.
   He said his committee recommended ``action to make critical
network (facilities) more secure, reduce the concentration of
network traffic and examine ways to provide more diversity in
transmission facilities.''
   He said the government also should establish additional emergency
plans using simulated disaster and recovery scenarios and should try
to determine means of protecting public networks from ``penetration
by hostile users.''
   McDonald said the government has excellent contingency plans for
disasters that cause massive loss of life, but ``when it comes to
the areas of economic disruption or social disruption, we feel that
more needs to be done.''
   Committee Chairman John Glenn, D-Ohio, said he didn't want the
government to play ``Big Brother'' and saddle the industry with more
rules.
   ``But if we see vulnerabilities creeping in, we can't afford to
stay out of it ... if we're looking at the national security,''
Glenn said.
   Lane said an effort is essential ``to identify and initiate
measures to harden networks to withstand assaults and to make plans
to recover services lost as a result of successful attack.''

   Mayor Eugene Sawyer promised to make the debate a
``hot time'' for front-runner Richard M. Daley, but it was an
underdog who tried to light a fire under a mayoral campaign that has
been anything but sizzling.
   Liberal Alderman Larry Bloom needled both his foes as they
squabbled about Sawyer's campaign advertisements. Bloom, a
long-shot, also questioned their independence and said he was the
only candidate who could unify the city.
   ``People say, `White people are voting for Daley because's he's
white ... black people are voting for Sawyer because they think he's
black,''' said Bloom, who is white but represents a predominantly
black ward.
   ``They do not think I'm black, Larry,'' Sawyer retorted. ``They
know I'm black.''
   Sawyer's quick reply earned laughter and loud applause from the
250 people in the audience at public television station WTTW
Tuesday. It was the first and only debate scheduled before the Feb.
28 Democratic primary.
   Polls show Daley, the Cook County state's attorney and son of the
late mayor, holding a commanding lead of 50 percent to 30 percent
for Sawyer and 10 percent for Bloom, with 10 percent undecided.
   When a questioner said Sawyer's ads ``characterized Richard Daley
as dumb,'' and asked whether they were the acts of a desperate
candidate, the mayor denied the suggestion.
   ``The characterization that you make is absolutely untrue. I did
not say that, the commercials did not say that. ... Those
commercials were designed to let people know that he has not been
out (in the communities), that he has not taken the opportunity to
discuss issues,'' Sawyer said.
   Daley said the ads are ``very sad to see. I think people are sick
and tired of this (kind of personal attack) all over the city.''
   Bloom, who carries a toy duck to appearances to dramatize his
claim that Daley is ``ducking'' chances to appear before the same
crowds, interjected with some humor.
   ``Well I've had lots of problems in this campaign. I've had
problems getting noticed by the press ... but there is one problem I
haven't had and that is how to spend money on commercials. I don't
have enough money to put them on.''
   Bloom went on the offensive throughout the 90-minute forum. He
suggested Sawyer was beholden to a City Council clique of
anti-reform aldermen who elected him mayor after Harold Washington's
sudden death of a heart attack 15 months ago, and Daley was beholden
to individuals and companies who have lined his war chest with
contributions of up to $100,000.
   He also said Daley lacked the managerial skills and the ability
to heal racial wounds that the next mayor needs.
   ``Yes, Richie, you could muddle through a term as mayor, just as
Gene has muddled through the past year,'' he said. ``But that's not
good enough.''
   Observers generally agreed, however, that Daley emerged without
serious damage and would be able to maintain a conservative campaign
strategy aimed at protecting his lead.
   ``Bloom was the clear-cut winner,'' said veteran political
analyst Tom Roesser, ``but he overdid it. ... He didn't have to wrap
the kitchen sink around him.''

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the nation.
   Feb. 7
   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on the S&amp;L crisis:
   The Bush administration's trial balloon to charge depositors fees
to bail out the faltering savings and loan industry has been
properly shot down.
   However, President Bush's new idea might just fly. The new plan
calls for borrowing, in the form of bonds, to finance the bail out
and repaying the bonds with increased insurance payments from banks
and S&amp;L's.
   Although consumers will help pay eventually in such things as
reduced interest rates, requiring substantial industry payment is
much fairer than a depositor's tax.
   The president also recommended changes in the federal supervision
of the savings and loan industry, and said he would recommend
increased Justice Department investigation of alleged wrongdoing in
faild thrifts.
   The Bush plan is as painless as could be expected and appears to
have industry support.

   Feb. 4
   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on the S&amp;L crisis:
   There has been so much nonsense in recent days about the savings
and loan crisis that it was good to hear a bit of sense somewhere on
Capitol Hill.
   The nation's 350 insolvent S&amp;Ls, reports the General Accounting
OFfice, should be closed quickly. ``These institutions must be
isolated from the rest of the industry to prevent them from
competing with healthy institutions,'' said comptroller general
Charles Bowsher.
   Bowsher is right on the money. In the present deregulated market,
failing S&amp;Ls are free to continue seeking deposits, paying
above-market rates on money which, sooner or later, will have to be
repaid by the federal government. It's a classic case of throwing
good money after bad. ...
   The 350 failed S&amp;Ls haven't been closed already because there's
no money to pay depositors. Congress and the outgoing Reagan
administration kept postponing the day of reckoning.
   It has now arrived, and one part of the solution, closing all
insolvent S&amp;Ls, is on the table. It doesn't make coming up with the
money any easier, but shows that the longer we wait, the more
painful the bill.

   The U.S. Census Bureau says there were 504,404 elected officials
in the nation's 83,237 governments in 1987 (its latest figures).
   If you have trouble falling asleep, try counting these people
instead of sheep. At one per second, it could take you 140 hours, or
nearly six days around the clock, just to dispose of the
officeholders.
   Or you could simply decide to stay awake worrying about all your

   Houston Chronicle on President Bush's trip to South Korea:
   President Bush has scheduled a visit of several hours in Seoul,
South Korea, later this month. He is likely to get an earful.
   Government and business in South Korea are worried about the
effects of the new trade legislation that could punish the country
for unfair trade practices.
   There is some disappointment in Korean circles over Bush's choice
of Donald Gregg, a former CIA officer who was Bush's national
security adviser as vice president, as ambassador to Seoul.
   There will be efforts to dispel lingering doubts about the
stability of the South Korean government.
   And there will be the noisy radical students who are
anti-government and anti-American.
   Bush might well have postponed his visit (until) a later date.
One thing is certain: He will have to be very careful about what he
says during the Seoul stopover.

   Tulsa (Okla.) World on the Sino-Soviet summit:
   There was a time when the very thought of renewed relations
between China and the Soviet Union would have scared the daylights
out of Americans. How times change.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will soon visit China, the
first Russian leader to do so since Nikita Khrushchev met Mao
Tse-tung in 1959. And most Americans aren't greatly concerned.
   The limited renewal of relations between these two giants cannot
be dismissed by American strategic planners, of course.
   But it may even produce some advantages for the free world. It
could shore up Russian confidence in Gorbachev and strengthen his
hand in his reform efforts.
   Stable relations between China and Russia _ once seen as a danger
to the West _ will now be cautiously welcomed by most of the world.
Stability is a highly prized commodity these days.

   The Honolulu Advertiser on the John Tower nomination:
   Even if the charges about (John) Tower's drinking and womanizing
turn out to be so much scurrilous, unsupported gossip, there must be
others who are better qualified (to be secretary of defense).
   And if (President) Bush defends Tower strongly now, that will be
a tip that it's time to watch more closely what the president does,
and not to just read his lips.
   This simply isn't the time for a John Tower-type in that job.

   Times-Union, Albany N.Y., on the John Tower nomination:
   The president of the United States has traditionally, and
rightly, been permitted to appoint his cabinet pretty much as he has
seen fit. The president, after all, has to appoint men and women
whom he knows and with whom he can work closely.
   In that sense, John Tower, the defense secretary-designate,
should be approved by the Senate. ...
   President Bush ... has chosen for defense secretary a man whose
job resume raises numerous questions about potential conflicts of
interest.
   Since retiring from the Senate, where he served on a major
defense committee, ... Tower has managed to become perhaps the
premier defense lobbyist in the country. Last year he earned nearly
three-quarters of a million dollars from half a dozen of the
nation's largest defense contractors. Now he is about to become the
most important Defense Department buyer. ...
   There is nothing to suggest that ... Tower is anything but
upright and honest. The issue is neither his character nor his
competence, but the high criteria ... Bush has vowed to establish
for public servants.
   Just what are those criteria, and is there a tension between what
the president says and what he does? If so, it should be ironed out.

   The Indianapolis Star on Black History Month:
   The world of entertainment and the world of sports would be bleak
indeed without their black American stars and superstars.
   But below the spectacular highlands of fame and glory, black
families and individuals working in everyday jobs made their
contributions to the building of America.
   Much that goes into the making of a nation is far from glamorous,
but even though it is obscure, it is necessary, it is part of the
big picture, it is elemental in the weave of life.
   This is Black History Month, which is dedicated to widening
knowledge and deepening understanding of the role of blacks in
American life.
   If you do not know anything about Countee Cullen, Edward Bouchet,
Jupiter Hammon, James Weldon Johnson, Gen. Daniel James Jr.,
Langston Hughes, Lorraine Hansberry, Gwendolyn Brooks, Harriet
Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, August Wilson,
Peter Salem, Pedro Alonzo Nino, Dr. Carter G. Woodson and Rosa
Parks, it is high time you did.

   The New Mexican, Santa Fe, N.M., on border ditch and fence
proposals:
   Proposals to spend millions of dollars to build ditches and
fences along the U.S-Mexico border are neither new nor wise.
   Last month, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
proposed a four-mile ditch near San Diego to stop vehicles from
crossing illegally along that section of the international border.
The price tag of the 14-foot-wide, 5-foot-deep ditch would be about
$2 million.
   Associate Attorney General Francs A. Keating II compared it to a
``buried Berlin Wall.'' Mexico City newspapers called it the ``Chile
Curtain.''
   Next, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a private
immigration reform group, proposed that the government build 10
miles of 12-foot concrete bunkers topped with 8-foot wire fences on
the border at El Paso, Texas. That would cost millions more,
although no estimate was given.
   It would be a waste of taxpayers' money to turn these plans into
concrete and posts and wire _ obstacles that are unlikely to reduce
the flow of illegal immigrants or drug trafficking in any
significant fashion.
   They serve only to cause more hard feelings along the border and
between the governments of the two countries.

   An explosion caused substantial
damage in a local government building in the town of Usti nad Labem
early Wednesday in what the state news agency CTK described as a
criminal attack. No injuries were reported.
   ``There is no doubt that this was an intentional criminal act,''
the news agency said.
   Usti nad Labem is 60 miles north of Prague.
   The report said only that the atrium of the government building
complex was blown up without providing other details.

   The CBS press release heralding the Beatles' first appearance in
the United States was, in retrospect low-keyed. It identified them
as ``The Beatles of London'' _ a ``wildly popular quartet of English
recording stars.'' They were billed on the show with the comedy team
of Mitzi McCall and Charlie Brill, impressionist Frank Gorshin, a
tumbling act called the four Fays and 37 members of the cast from
the Broadway musical, ``Oliver.''
   Sullivan, more animated than usual, handled the squealing
audience as a father would a hyperactive child. He gently shushed
them and made the girls promise to stay in their seats. He told the
audience Elvis Presley had sent a wire wishing the Beatles ``a
tremendous success'' in our country, introduced a commercial for
Aero Shave and then swept his arm through the air as the curtain
parted.
   There was Paul, 21, wide-eyed and boyish, feverishly working the
bass guitar and singing ``All My Loving'' at one microphone. George,
20, was on lead guitar. John, 23, on rhythm guitar, harmonized at
another microphone. Ringo, 23, sat high above them on a platform,
pounding out beats on the drums.
   Paul soloed on ``Til There Was You'' from the Broadway show,
``The Music Man.'' Later, after a magician did card tricks and
Georgia Brown sang songs from ``Oliver,'' the Beatles returned with
the Lennon-McCartney song, ``She Loves You.''
   They were fresh and school boy neat in their Edwardian jackets,
shirts and ties. Their hair, considered outrageously long at the
time, fell in agreeable bangs across their foreheads and stopped
somewhere mid-neck. The Beatle hair style eventually became as
conservative as a crewcut.
   After the Sullivan show, the Beatles played the Washington
Coliseum in Washington, D.C. On Feb. 12, they played Carnegie Hall,
where fans drowned their music in screams.
   Three years later, the Beatles began to show signs of weariness
and drifting apart. Exhausted from years of concert touring,
McCartney and Lennon had each done some independent film work;
Lennon met his future wife, Yoko Ono, in a London art gallery in
1967, around the time they recorded ``Sgt. Pepper.'' Harrison went
off to India to study sitar under Ravi Shankar. Two months after
``Sgt. Pepper'' was released, Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager
and stabilizing influence, died. With him went much of the spirit
that had held the group together.
   In 1970, a year after the critically acclaimed ``Abbey Road'' was
released, McCartney came out with a solo LP and a self-interview
critical of the other Beatles. The LP and movie, ``Let It Be,'' came
out and by the end of the year, the group dissolved.

   A jury resumed deliberations today in the case
against a drifter accused of murdering and sexually mutilating three
American Indian women.
   The jurors received the case Tuesday after a prosecutor argued
that Billy Glaze was still savoring the ``ghoulish'' slayings and a
defense attorney charged that Glaze had been victimized by publicity
and vindictive witnesses.
   Glaze, 45, is charged with murdering Kathleen Bullman, 19;
Angeline Whitebird-Sweet, 27, and Angela Green, 26, in 1986 and 1987
in Minneapolis. If convicted, he faces a mandatory sentence of life
in prison. Minnesota has no death penalty.
   Prosecutor Pete Connors said in closing arguments that Glaze, who
pretended to be an Indian, ``hated women and he particularly hated
Indian women.''
   ``He had a fury in his gut. He wanted to hurt them and hurt them
badly and he wanted to kill them and to have them die in anguish,''
Connors said. ``He killed these women in an unbelievably ghoulish
fashion and he's sitting in jail enjoying it.''
   Defense attorney Michael Colich characterized Glaze as a
non-violent drifter who called attention to himself by saying
despicable things about women.
   He said police were not thorough in their investigation of other
suspects because of public pressure to solve the killings.
   ``Not one piece of evidence points to Billy Glaze, but because he
has a bad mouth and because he left town they think he did it,''
Colich said.

<HEAD>`Hairspray' Filmmaker Gives Collection to University</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Director John Waters, who resurrected
1960s crazes in ``Hairspray'' and scratch-and-sniff cards in
``Polyester,'' is giving his scripts, scrapbooks, costumes and other
memorabilia to Wesleyan University.
   Waters joins other film greats, including Clint Eastwood, Frank
Crapra, Ingrid Bergman and Elia Kazan, who have donated their papers
to the school's Cinema Archives.
   ``We consider Waters a major American artist,'' said Jeanine
Basinger, archives curator and a professor of film studies at
Wesleyan.
   ``It's a massive collection,'' she said of Waters' donation.
``And because he is an active filmmaker, it will continue to come to
us over the years. It will be the most complete collection of a
filmmaker's work ever.''
   Waters, who once described his movies as ``comedies for a special
audience who think they've seen everything,'' has attained cult
status as a quirky, campy and sometimes scatological director.
   Many of his films featured the outrageous female impersonator
Divine, who died last year.
   Waters, 42, achieved mainstream success last year with the comedy
``Hairspray.''
   ``As (Jean) Cocteau said about America, `First you shock them,
and then they put you in a museum,' so that's what we're doing,''
said Basinger.
   Waters made his first movie, ``Hag in a Black Leather Jacket,''
in 1964. His first film to attract national attention was 1972's
``Pink Flamingos,'' which the Museum of Modern Art selected as part
of its salute to American humor in 1976.
   He followed that film with ``Female Trouble'' in 1974,
``Desperate Living'' in 1978 and ``Polyester'' in 1981.

   The government won a bid to buy an
official residence for its prime minister, a 40-room palace on the
waterfront that already has been dubbed Sweden's 10 Downing St., the
owners said Wendesday.
   The price of the palace, at No. 18 Stromgatan, was about $7.2
million. Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson won't move in until after
$2.4 million in renovations, said Tommy Thulin, an official of the
Sager foundation, which owned it.
   Carlsson, who rents an apartment owned by the Swedish crown, will
have his new home tucked between the prime minister's office and the
foreign ministry, with a view toward the royal palace. The
1,380-square-yard building also will include conference halls and
foreign ministry offices.
   Its last owner, Leo Sager, bequeathed it to the Roman Catholic
church on condition his wife could stay as long as she lived. She
died in May at age 93.
   The Sager foundation, which administers the estate for the
church, said other bids were higher but it decided to sell to the
government to ensure the palace wouldn't be torn down.
   Until the 1986 assassination of Olof Palme, prime ministers in
egalitarian Sweden lived in their own homes.

<TEXT>
   An FBI agent told a Senate investigative panel
today that corruption is pervasive among Indian tribes in the United
States, but often federal laws are inadequate to prosecute
wrongdoers.
   Special Agent Richard James Elroy said agents investigating
bribery can often prove that money has changed hands between
contractors and tribal leaders, but are unable to demonstrate there
was the kind of quid pro quo agreement that a prosecutor can use to
show that money was in exchange for a favor.
   He also said state officials would be treated differently than
Indian leaders are if corruption in their governments was suspected.
``For some reason tribal governments are not included in the code
for treatment like state governments would be,'' he said.
   Elroy acknowledged that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is
responsible for oversight in Indian reservation business. But he
said tribal leaders have had local BIA directors removed by
complaining to Washington.
   Another FBI agent, Anthony Daniels, said there has been
infiltration of legal Indian gambling operations by organized crime.
   ``Most of the available examples of La Cosa Nostra influence in
Indian bingo games have been isolated,'' Daniels said, and he does
not view the problem as a substantial and consistent threat yet.
   However, he said, ``any form of high-stakes gambling seems to be
a magnet to the LCN. Whenever, or wherever, there are situations
which generate large volumes of cash, the LCN will most assuredly
attempt an approach.''
   He called for outside regulation of Indian gaming operations by
the federal government.
   In Tuesday's hearing, secretly taped conversations were played
indicating the chairman of the Navajo nation devised a scheme to
cover up thousands of dollars in kickbacks from the sale of a
491,000-acre ranch to his tribe.
   The voice of tribal chairman Peter MacDonald Sr. was heard in a
recording made by real estate broker Byron T. ``Bud'' Brown in
cooperation with a special investigative unit of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs.
   Brown, who testified before the panel under a grant of immunity,
said he paid MacDonald $25,000 to pay a bank loan and gave him
$50,000 in cash and an expensively equipped BMW automobile as his
share of profits from the sale of the 491,000-acre Big Boquillas
ranch in western Arizona.
   In the tape recording of a conversation Nov. 22, 1988, MacDonald
tells Brown to say that the $25,000 and car were for his son, Peter
MacDonald Jr.
   They discuss point by point what Brown should tell investigators.
   ``It's Rocky that asked you for this 25,000,'' the senior
MacDonald says in reference to his son, nicknamed Rocky. And later,
the older MacDonald is heard saying that his son ``wanted the car,
since he doesn't have a vehicle.''
   The senior MacDonald wanted to cover up the payments after the
local U.S. attorney began an investigation of the sale, Brown told
the committee.
   The sale raised questions because of a $7.2 million profit made
by the men who brokered it. Brown had arranged for businessman Tom
Tracy to buy the ranch from Tenneco West Inc. for $26.2 million,
then immediately sell it to the Navajos for $33 million. Under the
deal, Tracy and Brown shared the profit, with Brown then paying
MacDonald.
   ``I felt and still feel that the ranch, at $68 an acre is a good
value,'' Brown said, noting that the Navajos most recently have paid
$100 or more per acre for property.
   ``What bothers me is that what I did with Chairman MacDonald was
improper,'' he said.
   Besides giving MacDonald $25,000 and a car, Brown said he paid
the tribal chairman several $5,000 increments in $100 bills.
   The payments were arranged by MacDonald's son, who called Brown
when his father needed money and used the word ``golf balls'' as a
code for money.
   In another taped conversation played for the committee, Brown is
heard talking to the junior MacDonald on Dec. 14, 1988.
   ``We're all three of us Three Musketeers shoulder to shoulder,''
MacDonald says in reference to Brown's question as to whether he
would stick by the story with his father and Brown.
   On Monday, the junior MacDonald, who is an attorney, told the
committee under immunity that he went along with the scheme,
``because I love my father.''
   Representatives of a Navajo task force appeared at the committee
hearing and distributed a statement in which they demanded to be
heard by the committee.
   ``Various individuals have implicated and leveled charges against
the Navajo Nation without substantiating their allegations with
facts,'' the group said.
   ``Such malicious allegations are attempts to discredit the
integrity of the Navajo Nation, its people, government and
sovereignty.''
   ``While corruption may exist in any government or at any level
within the Navajo Nation, as it may in Washington D.C., the
committee's nearly exclusive focus on selected abuses is creating
the public impression that corruption at Navajo is universal,'' the
statement said.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who chairs the special
investigative unit, said arrangements to have members of the Navajo
task force testify in the latter part of the month would be made.

   An American jet carrying 144 people
crashed today into a mountain in the Azores, and a Portuguese news
agency quoted an official as saying it appeared all on board were
killed.
   The destination of the Boeing 707 was not clear.
   Gualder Cordero, the airport dispatcher at Santa Maria Airport,
said in a telephone interview the jet was bound for the United
States, but he did not say what state.
   ``They're flying from Bergamo, Italy, to Santa Maria, Azores, for
a technical landing, then would proceed to Smyrna in the United
States,'' he said. But an emergency services official on the Azores
island of Terceira said the jet was flying from Bergamo to the
Dominican Republic.
   The Portugeuse news agency Lusa quoted a spokesman from the
Azores civil protection service as saying there appeared to be no
survivors. The official, who was not identified, said two bodies had
been found.
   Lusa said the aircraft belonged to the U.S. airline Independent
Air Corp., based in Smyrna, Tenn.
   An Independent Air official confirmed one of the company's jets
had crashed in the Azores but provided no other details. ``We have
confirmation that it was one of our jets, but that's all the
information we have at this time,'' the official, Jan Shoemaker,
told The Associated Press.
   The emergency services official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the jet slammed into the 1,794-foot Pico Alto
mountain on Santa Maria island.
   Asked if there were any radio messages or warnings before the
plane went down, Cordero replied, ``No, no, no no.''
   The Azores is an island chain 1,200 miles west of Portugal.

   President Bush will put an additional $250
million or so for education programs into the budget proposal he
submits to Congress on Thursday as a down-payment on his pledge to
be the ``education president,'' congressional and administration
sources said today.
   The money will go for a broadening of the Head Start program and
perhaps a few other initiatives Bush promised to pursue during his
presidential campaign last year, said the sources, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   But much of Bush's emphasis on education _ at least for the 1990
fiscal year _ will be rhetorical rather than financial, the sources
conceded. ``The money just isn't there,'' said one Republican
congressional leadership aide. ``Much of what he wants to do will
not involve federal funds.''
   Bush has been revealing his budget in bits and pieces in advance
of its release as he tries to emphasize those parts likely to
engender a warm reception on Capitol Hill.
   ``I am under no illusions that we are going to keep everybody
happy,'' he said while asking GOP senators for a sympathetic hearing
in his speech to Congress on Thursday night. He repeated the message
in a series of stops in the Capitol on Tuesday, but specifically
mentioned those things the lawmakers wanted to hear _ no tax
increase, and more money for the environment, education, and
fighting drugs.
   ``It will make I think a strong beginning in some of the areas
that a lot of us talked about in the past campaign,'' he said.
   But the Bush plan necessarily will include many less popular
items, many left over from the fiscal 1990 spending plan drafted by
President Reagan _ such as a $5 billion reduction in the Medicare
health plan for the elderly. And Bush has decided to include some
controversial items of his own as he struggles to balance his no-tax
pledge and other campaign promises.
   Statements by Bush himself, and conversations with administration
and congressional officials, reveal the list of his proposals will
include:
   _A cut in the tax rate on capital gains, as promised by Bush in
the campaign. The administration will claim the lower tax rate
actually boosts government revenues, an extremely controversial
stand especially among Democrats who oppose the cut as favoring the
wealthy.
   The rate, now 28 percent, would be reduced more for longer
investments in order to emphasize business investment rather than
fast-buck transactions.
   _Holding the military budget to only an inflationary increase in
the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, and then only slightly more than
inflation in the next two years. Conservatives are sure to oppose
this sharp retreat from the Reagan military build-up.
   Reagan had proposed increasing military spending authority to
$315.2 billion next year, and Bush's stance would cut that $6
billion. Actual cash outlays, money spent during 1990, would be
reduced $2 billion.
   _A child-care tax credit, instead of the more direct federal
child-care system favored by many in the Democratic Congress. The
tax credit could eventually cost the Treasury about $2 billion a
year. At much smaller cost, Bush will call for an expanded tax
benefit for adoption.
   Bush on Tuesday declared his budget ``pretty well finalized,''
talking to reporters at a final budget session with budget director
Richard Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, economic adviser
Michael Boskin and Vice President Dan Quayle.
   His initiatives, plus his savings-and-loan bailout plan which
will cost taxpayers an estimated $1.9 billion next year, will be
included in a 125-page proposal to Congress Thursday. The proposals
in the document will be layered upon the $1.15 trillion budget that
Reagan submitted.
   Although Bush is changing its emphasis somewhat, he relies on the
Reagan program to reduce the deficit below the $100 billion maximum
required by the Gramm-Rudman law.
   Reagan's economic and technical estimates, considered by many in
Congress and the private sector as too optimistic, are largely
embraced. Bush also goes along with Reagan's call for eliminating
many domestic programs and cutting many others, including farm
subsidies, and eliminating cost-of-living increases next year for
federal retirees. His plan also would sell off many of the assets
Reagan had sought to sell, and raise many fees for government
services.
   Although Bush rejects Reagan's proposal to cut the Medicaid
program for the poor, and plans to increase those benefits modestly
through administrative cost-cutting, he plans to include his
predecessor's $5 billion cut in the Medicare program's expected
spending.

   Minnesota's education commissioner is
urging schools to drop Indian nicknames, but an Indian leader says
that's not necessarily a good idea.
   ``If your school district has an Indian mascot, emblem or symbol,
please report your progress toward removing them,'' Commissioner
Ruth Randall and state Board of Education president Marjorie Johnson
said in a letter this week.
   They called the names ``offensive to persons of American Indian
culture'' and reminded districts of a board resolution adopted last
year encouraging removal of Indian mascots.
   But Chip Wadena, president of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe and
the White Earth Indian Reservation, criticized the board for not
consulting tribal officials.
   Wadena and other Indian leaders said Tuesday that they want the
right to keep such mascots when the schools' students are
predominantly American Indian. They also said that Indian themes are
not a problem if handled with respect.
   Wadena said the White Earth tribal council is supporting the
Mahnomen School District, which is within the reservation, in
retaining its ``Indians'' nickname. About 38 percent of Mahnomen
High School students are Indian.
   But Phil St. John, a member of Concerned American Indian Parents
who has led a campaign against using Indian names as mascots, said
such names are derogatory and portray Indians in ``an animalistic,
warlike image.''
   Last month, the Minnesota Civil Liberties Union threatened to sue
50 public schools for civil rights violations if they don't change
their Indian mascots.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was
pleased with his talks Wednesday with West German Chancellery

for nuclear and chemical weapons, the State Department said.
   Baker met with Schauble, who handles special tasks for the

   The main topic of conversation was the enhancement of West
Germany's export controls, Redman added.
   ``Secretary Baker was encouraged by what he heard,'' Redman said.
   The United States has been pressing West Germany to crack down on
firms selling components that can be used to make nuclear and
chemical weapons, in the wake of reports that West German companies
sold such items to Libya, India, Iraq and Iran.
   Baker met last week with West German Economics Minister Helmut
Haussman on the same subject.

   China's population may reach 1.3 billion by the
end of the century, 100 million more than the target, because of
failures in carrying out the nation's strict family planning
policies.
   The official China Daily on Wednesday quoted population experts
as blaming administrators for not holding down population growth.
The experts discounted government arguments the recent surge in the
growth rate was due to a baby boom.
   China, the world's most populous nation, has about 1.09 billion
people.
   Yu Jingyuan, senior engineer of the Beijing Institute of
Information and Control, was quoted as saying the target of 1.2
billion people by the year 2000 could have been met if the
government had adhered to its one-child policy.
   Yu said stricter controls must be placed on rural families.
   The 1980 policy of limiting each couple to one child generally
has been successful in crowded urban areas but has met strong
resistance in the countryside, where couples want more children,
particularly sons, to help in the fields and care for them when they
become old.
   Newly affluent farmers are often willing to pay large fines for
having two or three children. Many rural areas have relaxed the
one-child policy to allow couples whose first child is a girl try
for a boy.
   The nationwide growth rate climbed from 11 per thousand in 1985
to 14.1 in 1986 and 16.2 last year. Family planning officials have
said the main cause of the climbing growth rate is that a baby boom
generation from the early 1960s has reached child-bearing age.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
speaking on the eve of President Bush's budget address to Congress,
said Wednesday it was time for Bush to deliver ``deeds to match
words'' and promised bipartisan cooperation with the White House.
   Mitchell, in a speech to a United Auto Workers conference,
rattled off a list of Bush campaign proposals on issues, including
the environment, education and child care, and said he would be
listening closely when the president addresses a joint session.
   ``We look forward to his proposals, beginning (Thursday) night,
as to how we should give meaning to those words,'' the Maine
Democrat said. ``These policies, like all others, must begin with
words. But they cannot end with words.
   ``There must be deeds to match words, action to fulfill
intention,'' Mitchell continued. ``We're going to hold the president
accountable to his words and we want to work with him. ... Working
together we can do much.''
   Mitchell also promised passage of legislation to increase the
minimum wage, one of his top legislative priorities as well as
labor's.
   ``If I don't do anything else as majority leader of the United
States Senate, I'm going to see that the minimum wage is increased
this year as it should be,'' he said to a standing ovation.
   The minimum wage, which has been $3.35 an hour since 1981, would
increase 40 cents an hour to $4.55 at the end of three years under
Senate legislation supported by Mitchell. After that, the
legislation calls for the minimum wage to be indexed annually to 50
percent of the average hourly income of U.S. workers.
   Mitchell delivered a lengthy defense of the Democratic Party,
traditionally backed by organized labor, and said Bush's call for a
``kinder, gentler'' America included ideas ``for which we have
worked as Democrats for a half century.''
   But, in an unusual statement nonetheless met with applause,
Mitchell said many of those those who have benefitted from
Democrat-sponsored programs, including union members, have abandoned
the party.
   ``There's a lot of analysis about why Democratic candidates have
lost five out of (the last) six presidential elections,'' Mitchell
said. ``And as a member of the Democratic leadership I say we in the
party share a major portion of the responsibility. But I also say to
you that there are a lot, too many, of your members who have
forgotten where they came from, who because of Democrats began to
live like Republicans and then started voting that way.''

   Two former top executives of Regina Co.
pleaded guilty today to defrauding investors in the vacuum cleaner
company of more than $100 million by issuing inflated earnings
reports.
   Former Regina Chairman Donald D. Sheelen, 42, and former Chief
Financial Officer Vincent P. Golden, 48, admitted misleading
stockholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1987 and
1988.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said Sheelen instructed Golden
to falsify sales by not subtracting returned appliances from company
income. Regina had problems with the quality of its Housekeeper
vacuum cleaners, analysts said.
   ``This is a case representing massive misrepresentation by the
company,'' Alito said at a news conference. ``It represents losses
well in excess of $100 million by the investing public.''
   The two men pleaded guilty to mail and security fraud and could
receive up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines at
sentencing April 14. Alito said restitution may also be sought. The
men were freed on their own recognizance.
   In 1987 and 1988, Regina filed false financial reports showing a
$10.9 million profit on sales of $181.1 million for its latest
fiscal year.
   In September, it withdrew the statements as inaccurate, and its
stock plunged after the company stunned analysts with a negative
sales and earnings forecast.
   Regina shares, which traded as high as $27 in August 1988,
plunged to a low of less than $4 on Sept. 28 in over-the-counter
trading.
   In January, the company issued a revised financial statement that
showed a loss for the 15-month period ending Sept. 30, 1988, of
$16.8 million on sales of $190.3 million.
   Malcolm L. Sherman, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Rahway-based vacuum cleaner company, said Tuesday that Regina would
agree to be sold.
   Sheelen, also the company's former president and chief executive
officer, owns 39.7 percent of Regina's stock. In 1984, he and
another executive took the company private in a leveraged buyout.
The next year, it went public at $10.50 a share.

   Several members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions
from the same defense contracting firms that hired Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower to lobby for them, records show.
   Tower, a former Republican senator from Texas who headed the
armed services panel until his retirement in 1984, has said he
received over $1 million in a three-year period from firms including
Rockwell International, Martin Marietta Corp., LTV Aerospace and
Defense Co., and Textron Corp.
   Members of the panel, which has put off a vote on Tower's
nomination, have raised questions about whether Tower could remain
impartial at the Pentagon because of his ties to defense contractors.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, said Wednesday that
the most recent delay in the confirmation process stemmed from the
FBI's investigation into new allegations of a ``financial nature''
involving the nominee.
   Records on file at the Federal Election Commission show that in
1987 and 1988 the political action committees of at least four
defense firms that hired Tower also contributed to panel members.
   Altogether, the PACs gave to more than 100 presidential,
senatorial and congressional candidates. Federal election law
prohibits companies from giving directly to campaigns, but PACs may
contribute up to $10,000 per election cycle to a candidate.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat who won re-election in New Mexico
last November, was the armed services committee member receiving the
most from the four PACs. He received a total of $18,000, including
the largest single contribution, $10,000 from Textron.
   Other big receivers on the committee were Sens. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif., who got $15,800 from the four firms, and Malcolm Wallop,
R-Wyo., who received $15,700. Wallop is a new member of the panel.
Both men were re-elected last year.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., an armed services committee member who
unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination last
year, received $2,000 from LTV and $3,000 from Textron.
   Another member up for re-election, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
accepted $1,000 from LTV Aerospace, the records show.
   Two senators who do not face re-election until 1992 received
contributions from the defense companies. Sen. Richard Shelby,
D-Ala., accepted $3,000 from Textron, and $1,000 each from LTV
Aerospace and Martin Marietta.
   And Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., took $2,500 from Textron, and
$1,000 each from Martin Marietta and LTV.
   The PAC set up by LTV Aerospace gave money to 146 candidates,
including $5,000 to President Bush, and spent a total of $173,284.
   Rockwell International's PAC spent about $378,000 on 286
candidates, while Martin Marietta gave $248,000 to 270 candidates,
and Textron contributed roughly $400,000 to 237 candidates.

   Police on Wednesday released an artist after
holding her three days for shooting a BB gun at her own sculpture in
an exhibition of avant-garde art, the official Xinhua News Agency
said.
   The exhibit, the largest modern art show in communist China's
40-year history, was closed by police a few hours after it opened
Sunday when Xiao Lu opened fire at her model of a phone booth.
   Xinhua said the Beijing Public Security Bureau ordered Ms. Xiao
and her boyfriend, Tang Songmang, detained five days as punishment
for disturbing public order. Tang, 28, tried to help Ms. Xiao, 25,
smuggle her gun from the China Art Gallery, Xinhua said.
   However, the report said police decided to release them after
three days as a concession in honor of the Lunar New Year holiday,
called Spring Festival. Monday began the new Year of the Snake, but
the official holiday lasts through Wednesday.
   Xinhua said Ms. Xiao acknowledged shooting at her sculpture, but
said it was because she thought it was imperfect and needed
``destructive art.''
   An exhibition organizer, Fei Dawei, said Monday it was Tang who
actually fired at the work. He said they ``were attempting to negate
modern civilization'' and called the action ``performance art.''
Authorities had banned performance art from the show in advance,
saying it might cause chaos.
   Fei said the show might reopen Friday. Xinhua did not comment on
the show's fate.
   Xinhua said Chinese regulations allow detention of up to 15 days
for disturbing public order. Police can impose detention sentences
without trial or opportunity for the accused to appeal.

<HEAD>Study Shows Modest Improvement From Parkinson's Disease Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental brain operation has produced
moderate improvement for some victims of Parkinson's disease, but
surgeons have failed to match dramatic results reported by a Mexican
doctor, a researcher said.
   ``All the patients in our group have said they felt it was
worthwhile, but in no case has it achieved what they hoped it
would,'' said Dr. Christopher G. Goetz of Rush-Presbyterian-St.
Luke's Medical Center in Chicago.
   The operation involves removing tissue from patients' adrenal
glands and transplanting it in their brains. The goal is to provide
the victims' brains with a source of dopamine, an essential
message-carrying chemical that they lack.
   The operation was first reported two years ago by Dr. Ignacio
Madrazo and colleagues at the National Autonomous University of
Mexico and the social security hospital system in Mexico City. They
reported dramatic improvement in two patients, and since then,
surgeons at many medical centers have tried to duplicate their
results.
   ``What came out originally was the sense that this was a
miracle,'' Goetz said. ``This is no miracle.''
   His report combined the results of surgery on 19 patients at his
hospital and at the University of South Florida and the University
of Kansas. The results were published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   Parkinson's disease results from destruction of a part of the
brain called the nigral tissue, which makes dopamine. The adrenal
glands, which lie above the kidneys, also produce this substance.
   Between 500,000 and 1 million Americans, including 2 percent of
everyone over 70, have Parkinson's. They often suffer tremors and
have trouble controlling their movements.
   Drugs can control the disease, but as the illness worsens, the
medicines lose their effectiveness and often don't work for hours at
a time.
   Before the surgery, the patients' drugs worked about half the
time. Afterward, this increased to three-quarters of the time.
   While the drugs are working, the patients are able to move about
and care for themselves with little assistance, although they still
clearly show the effects of the disease. When the drugs are not
effective, they are confined to wheelchairs.
   ``Despite cautious optimism, we conclude that the widespread use
of this procedure outside of research centers is premature,'' the
researchers wrote.

   C. Ronald Hovell, 400 miles away from the
debate on the size of his paycheck, considered time his greatest
enemy. Marylouise Uhlig, here in the middle of it all, dropped Ralph
Nader from her list of heroes.
   Both were on the verge of getting big pay increases but saw their
hopes dashed. A House plan to let the controversial federal pay
raises become law collapsed, and the pay package was scuttled just
hours before it was to take effect.
   ``I was just hoping the clock would tick faster than it did,''
said Hovell, a civilian deputy chief of staff for the Air Force
Logistics Command in Dayton, Ohio. ``I've got to admit that I'm down
emotionally, more than I was the first time.''
   The first time was four years ago _ the last time a presidential
commission recommended big pay hikes for Congress, federal judges
and senior government executives. Congress rejected those, too, in
the face of public outcry.
   This time was Tuesday, when the House caved in to mounting
pressure and passed a resolution rejecting the raises scheduled to
take effect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. The Senate quickly followed
suit and the measure was signed by President Bush.
   ``The mood is very, very bleak,'' said Uhlig, an Environmental
Protection Agency official. Like Hovell and 7,112 others at the top
levels of career civil service, she was due to receive a pay
increase under the plan.
   A majority of the executives live and work in the Washington
area, where the pay plan has been the talk of the town. Now there is
talk of leaving.
   ``I was very optimistic until two days ago,'' Uhlig said.
``Somehow it got off track. It's very demoralizing, very
discouraging. There is really going to be a great exodus of people.''
   Turnover among the executives averages 10 percent a year and is
double that among recipients of the presidential distinguished rank
award, a bonus program for the government's top managers.
   Hovell is among the winners of the award. His work includes
helping draft the Air Force's five-year budget plan and affects more
than 100,000 people.
   ``If I were eligible I would leave,'' said Hovell, a 32-year
government employee who won't reach pension eligibility for another
five years, when he turns 55. ``And if I were on the outside I'd
think twice about a government career.''
   Carol Bonosaro suggests talented managers or college graduates
won't even think once about government service now.
   ``The American taxpayer might like taking pot shots at Congress
but the net result is that the taxpayer is going to be the loser,''
said Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executive Association, an
organization representing the senior managers. ``We are not going to
be able to keep career executives in government and we're going to
see a lower quality of people serving in these jobs and the programs
will suffer.''
   Members of the government's senior executive service received a
4.1 percent cost-of-living raise in January and now make from
$68,700 to $80,700. The scale would have been from $80,000 to
$120,000 under the plan killed Tuesday, costing the government $112
million for the rest of this fiscal year and all of next year.
   ``The reaction has been a lot of talk about filling out the
retirement papers,'' Bonosaro said. ``How can you go home and look
at your family and say you're staying again at a salary half what
they can earn in the private sector.''
   Uhlig, 21 years a government employee, said, ``We're going to
have a crisis in the public service.'' And she blames Nader, the
consumer advocate she says she once admired.
   ``He was a hero of mine,'' Uhlig said of the man who helped lead
opposition to the pay raises.
   There was talk that Bush would propose legislation to give
federal judges and the executives raises.
   But Hovell wasn't expecting good news from Washington.
   ``I don't have any hope that it will happen,'' he said. ``I'm
glad I didn't go to the point where I was really spending the
money.''

   The Justice Department interrupted Oliver
North's Iran-Contra trial today, urging new safeguards to prevent
the former White House aide from making surprise disclosures of
classified information.
   North ``has made no effort to assist the court in dealing
responsibility with classified information,'' the department said in
a court filing that it made on behalf of U.S. intelligence agencies.
   In the filing by Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis,
the Justice Department asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
to prohibit North from disclosing any classified information except
with explicit court rulings that it is admissible and when ``the
United States has no pending objection at the time the disclosure is
made.''
   Gesell immediately postponed the jury selection process until
Thursday and scheduled an afternoon hearing to discuss ``whether the
Department of Justice has any business being here.'' The trial began
Jan. 31 and opening arguments had been imminent.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, whose office is prosecuting
North, protested the department's intervention and made a proposal
of his own in an attempt to overcome the agency's interference. He
proposed alternative proposals to protect classified information,
seeking an order ``to enable the court to proceed to trial without
delay.''
   The Justice Department, noting that Walsh had sought ``a less
extensive protective order'' than the one sought by the government,
said the attorney general, not the independent counsel, was the
final arbiter of classified information issues.
   ``Whether or not the Department of Justice has any business being
here has to be talked about,'' Gesell said. ``I'm just a way station
on an elevator ride upstairs.'' He said he wanted to hear arguments
on ``the right of the Department of Justice to participate against
the independent counsel.''
   Charging that North has provided ``totally useless or at best
minimally informative'' notices of the documents he wants to
disclose, the department urged Gesell to institute greater
protections to prevent unwarranted disclosures.
   A department source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that if Gesell ruled against the government it would appeal. Such an
appeal could delay the trial.
   The department said Gesell has issued only ``general guidance''
on the relevance and admissability of secret information, so ``the
parties are left to their own devices to determine in opening
statements, direct examination, and cross-examination as to what
classified information to mention.''
   Without specific orders, the department said ``there is every
reason to believe that irrelevent or immaterial classified
information might be revealed during trial.''
   The department urged Gesell to follow the procedures of the
Classified Information Procedures Act, known as CIPA. They provide
for closed hearings on the admissibility and relevance of classified
evidence and for the attorney general to object to disclosure on the
ground it would damage national security.
   The court can ``seek to resolve admissibility issues before any
evidence is offered, or it can postpone some decisions, but that
whatever the decision, it must afford the government and the
attorney general the protections of CIPA,'' the department's filing
said.
   North's ``obstinate refusal to participate meaningfully in CIPA
proceedings cannot undermine the right of the United States and the
responsibility of the attorney general to protect classified
information while assuring that cases that can be tried will be
tried,'' it said.
   ``At the present time, the procedures adopted by the court in the
instant case fail to implement the most important features'' of
CIPA, the document added.
   The government would be given an opportunity to register its
objections at closed hearings to the disclosure of any classified
evidence, the Justice Department said.
   The filing said North, a former White House national security
aide, would not need specific permission to rely on prosecution and
defense exhibits already edited for sensitive references by an
interagency security group.
   ``We are prepared to work with the court to make CIPA effective
in this case,'' the department said. ``It is a complex case in terms
of classified information, but we believe it is not so complex that
it cannot go forward.''
   But ``in the face of the defendant's intransigence, we believe it
is important that the government have the CIPA protections available
in their fullest,'' the department said.
   Walsh countered with a proposal of his own, seeking an order
``enabling the court to proceed to trial without delay.''
   The independent counsel said he wants an order stating that the
rules limiting disclosure for classified information apply to
North's opening statement, cross-examination and other aspects of
the defense case.
   Walsh also asked for an order stating that the defense make no
mention of certain unspecified topics in its opening statement or at
any point in the trial without first obtaining court approval.
   In addition, Walsh said the government will advise the defense,
in advance of a witness' testimony, of any classified information
that seems especially pertinent to the witness.
   ``The government will endeavor to keep ... identification of
classified information narrow, specific and reasonable,'' he said.
   North faces 12 criminal charges. He is accused of allegedly
concealing from Congress in 1985 and 1986 his efforts on behalf of
the Nicaraguan Contras and of covering up from the attorney general
the National Security Council's role in diverting money from the
Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.
   Due to national security concerns, the two central charges in the
case against North were dismissed Jan. 13.
   Those were the conspiracy and theft counts which accuse North of
illegally diverting more than $14 million in U.S. Iran arms sale
proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., thinks owners of
some troubled savings and loan associations deserve more than a
taxpayer bailout. Like some time in the public stocks, or at least
tar-and-feathering.
   ``An outrageous fraud has been perpetrated on American savers by
a select group of what I call go-go boys,'' Ms. Mikulski said in a
Senate speech Wednesday.
   ``These go-go boys used deposits to bankroll lavish lifestyles
and invest in crooked deals, and I think they must be punished. ...''
   Ms. Mikulski, whose state has had several S&amp;L failures, chairs
the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that likely would have a hand
in developing a bailout plan. On Tuesday, federal regulators took
control of the insolvent Baltimore Federal Financial, one of the
state's largest thrifts.
   ``Before we approve a single cent,'' to bail out insolvent S&amp;Ls,
she said, ``we need to mandate that there are real reforms and that
this will not happen again.
   ``I'd like to put them in a stock. ... I'd like everybody that's
got a CD (certificate of deposit) or $100 in one of these bad S&amp;Ls
to go up _ whether it's a senior citizen who's saved for his
daughter's or son's college education _ I'd like them to get
together and take a whack at some of them,'' she said.
   ``I would like, right today, for the appropriate federal
authorities to go out there and confiscate the personal assets of
those who are under investigation,'' she said. ``Let's confiscate
their Maseratis. Let's confiscate their yachts.''
   Some savings institutions are in trouble because they were caught
in a squeeze when they had to pay high interest rates to deposits to
remain competitive but were stuck with low-rate, long-term
mortgages, Ms. Mikulski said.
   ``But these other guys ... have perpetrated a fraud,'' she said.
``Two hundred years ago we would have tarred and feathered them and
run them out of town on a rail. Maybe we gotta get back to some
old-fashion justice.''

<HEAD>Judge Extends Copyright Protection in Battle of Computer Giants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that copyright
protection extends to the computer instructions embedded in
microchips.
   U.S. District Judge William Gray also ruled in the same case that
a Japanese manufacturer legally copied microchip designs from a U.S.
company.
   The precedent-setting split decision, filed Tuesday, could affect
some of the most closely guarded secrets of U.S. high-technology
companies, observers said.
   ``Everyone won and everyone lost,'' said Alice Leeper, an analyst
at Dataquest Inc.
   The ruling in the 7-year legal battle cleared NEC Ltd. of
allegations it illegally copied Intel Corp.'s 8086 and 8088 line of
computer chips. The chips are the key to IBM personal computer
systems.
   Gray said the Silicon Valley corporation's failure to ensure that
a copyright mark was included on each chip made by several of its
licensee companies meant it had forfeited its copyright on the chips.
   But Gray also upheld Intel's contention that copyright protection
extends to software called microcodes embedded in microprocessor
chips. Although chip technology was already protected under
copyright law, that did not extend to hidden software such as the
microcodes.
   Intel lawyer F. Thomas Dunlap called the ruling ``a broad
landmark decision for the industry.''
   ``We now have a precedent that our large investments in new
products ... can be protected under copyright law,'' he said.
   Robert Morrill, an attorney for NEC, said, ``This is going to be
a significant case in computer copyright law, and sets a nice
balance between what's protectable and what's not.''
   The two electronics giants, which had once been partners, began
battling in 1982.
   NEC, the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors, had
revenue of $21.8 billion in 1988. Intel, the No. 3 producer of
microchips in the United States, reported revenue of $2.9 billion
last year.

   Caldeira Fradique, president of the Independent Doctors' Union,
said almost all doctors were participating.
   Doctors have asked the Health Ministry for a pay raise, strictly

   Objections from listeners in heavily Catholic
Boston prompted a radio station to pull a commercial for frozen
seafood dinners featuring an actress playing a Roman Catholic nun
confessing to a ``priest.''
   ``On a personal level, I felt it was a very creative
commercial,'' said Tyler Cox, program manager at WBZ-AM, which
pulled the ad last week after several plays.
   Cox said a ``moderate'' number of listeners called the station,
which has a primary audience ages 40 to 50, and were quite vocal in
insisting the commercial be taken off the air.
   ``There's a very large Catholic base in Boston, which makes up a
sizable percentage of our listening audience,'' Cox said.
   The 30-second spot for Booth Seafood Products' frozen entrees is
titled ``Confession,'' and debuted nationally Jan. 23. It has aired
on 11 Boston radio stations.
   ``We did not, definitely, try to single out Catholics, or in any
way demean the Catholic religion,'' said Michael Yurchesyn,
marketing manager for National Sea Products Inc. and its Booth
subsidiary.
   ``We got one or two complaints from Denver and Kansas City,'' he
said, ``but I think we got more complaints in the Boston area than
anywhere else.''
   In part of the commercial, ``Sister Catherine'' confesses to
``Father Callahan'' that she has ``gone back to eating fish on
Friday.''
   ``We stopped that in the '60s,'' ``Father Callahan'' says.
   ``But Booth frozen seafood is so good.''
   ``Do you find frozen seafood tempting, sister?''
   Yurchesyn and Paul Klein of North Castle Partners, the Stamford,
Conn., agency that created the commercial, said preliminary market
research predicted possible backlash.
   But Klein said since it helps focus attention on the ad, ``the
controversy's not necessarily bad.''

   A restaurant employee was surprised
when a would-be robber was unmasked and turned out to be her husband.
   Police would not release the man's name because he had not been
charged, but West Valley City Police Detective Ron Edwards said
charges may be filed Thursday.
   The man waited outside an Arby's restaurant until the employees
locked up and began filing out early Sunday, police said.
   The unarmed man, wearing a pantyhose mask, then grabbed a
17-year-old girl from behind, believing she carried a bank bag.
   But the girl's boyfriend, an 18-year-old high school football
player, leaped from a car and dragged the man inside the restaurant,
police said.
   When the teen-ager pulled off the man's mask, his startled wife
exclaimed: ``It's my husband!''
   Four other employees also recognized the man, who fled. No money
was taken, police said.
   The 20-year-old suspect was found soon after hiding under
blankets in a bedroom at his home, officers said. He was being held
at the Salt Lake County jail for investigation of robbery and
assault.

<TEXT>
   The Federal National Mortgage Association and
the organization of local housing officials announced a pilot
program Wednesday selling foreclosed homes to local agencies for use
by low- and moderate-income families.
   The first sales will be in four Texas cities and in Denver.
Officials said they hope to expand the program throughout the
country.
   The federally chartered mortgage corporation known as Fannie Mae
agreed to make all its inventory of foreclosed homes in those cities
available for purchase by local housing or community development
agencies.
   The homes will be sold at a discount of 10 percent to 15 percent
from market value, said Patrick O'Neill, Fannie Mae senior vice
president for real estate sales.
   The discount reflects the savings to Fannie Mae in reduced
holding costs and the absence of real estate brokerage commissions
and other fees it must pay to sell the houses on the open market, he
said.
   The program was announced jointly by the Fannie Mae, a private
corporation chartered by Congress to provide financial services for
housing, and the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment
Officials, representing more than 2,500 local housing and
development agencies.
   Richard Nelson, executive director of the housing officials'
group, said local agencies would use money available from bonds,
local appropriations or federal grants to purchase the homes where
practical. The homes will be rented or sold to low- and
moderate-income families.
   Fannie Mae, the nation's largest investor in home mortgages, has
an inventory of 8,000 foreclosed homes nationally and acquires them
at a rate of about 900 a month. It sold 17,000 in 1988.
   The first sales will be in Austin, Dallas, Houston and San
Antonio, Texas, as well as Denver.

<TEXT>
   A man awaiting a heart transplant has been
supported a record 75 days on a stationary device that assists the
heart's main pumping chamber, raising hopes for development of a
portable version, a hospital said today.
   Texas Heart Institute researchers announced that the facility
will be the site of the first human use of a portable,
battery-operated heart assist device.
   Like the artificial heart, it is designed to keep patients alive
until they can receive transplants. It does not appear to cause
clots that lead to strokes, a problem often associated with the
artificial heart, researchers said.
   With Food and Drug Administration approval, the first tests of
the new device will begin early next year, hospital officials said.
   The patient, Louis E. Wilson, 39, of Winnfield, La., has been on
the heart assist device for nearly twice the previous world record.
   Wilson came to the institute Nov. 21 after he began to suffer
liver and kidney failure because of ischemic cardimyopathy, a
degenerative condition in which his heart cannot pump enough blood.
   On Nov. 25, a team led by Dr. O.H. Frazier implanted the heart
assist pump into Wilson's abdomen. The air-powered device has taken
over the pumping activity required to circulate the blood through
the 6-foot, 210-pound man's body.
   The pump, 6 inches long and 2 inches wide, is connected by tubes
that come out of the stomach and are hooked to a machine run by
electricity, forcing the patient to remain in the hospital while he
is using the device.
   Wilson's size and his type B blood have severely limited the
number of appropriate donor hearts, causing him to remain longer on
the pump than any previous patient, institute spokeswoman Joyce
Staton said today.
   Texas Heart Institute, which has used the pump 10 times, held the
previous world record of 41 days, she said. Washington Hospital
Center in Washington, D.C. and England's London Hospital also have
implanted the device.
   A similar device, the Novocor, has been used to support a patient
at Houston's Methodist Hospital for 100 days, said spokeswoman
Brenda Koch.
   She did not know if that was a record for that device, which also
pumps blood but has some technical differences from the one used at
the Texas Heart Institute.

<HEAD>NRC Moving to Require Random Drug, Alcohol Tests at US Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Wednesday
moved toward adoption of a regulation that would require random drug
and alcohol testing of employees at all U.S. nuclear power plants.
   The commission heard a briefing by the NRC staff on the proposed
rule, which would apply to all utilities operating or building
atomic power stations.
   Brian Grimes, an NRC official, said it was expected that the
commission will have a final vote on the regulation within about a
month. After that, he said, official publication of the rule would
take another month, followed by a six-month implementation period.
   About a third of the utilities now conduct some random testing,
said Grimes, director of reactor inspection and safeguards.
   The new regulation ``would establish random testing for all
utilities and at a fairly substantial rate _ perhaps at a rate of
100 percent per year,'' he said in an interview.
   If the 100 percent testing rate is implemented, it would require
1,000 random tests per year for every 1,000 employees. Because the
testing is random and the same employee may be tested more than once
per year, this rate would ensure that about two-thirds of all
employees are tested every year.
   ``The deterrent effect is thought to come from the possibility
that any day, any individual may be subject to a test, even though
he may have just had one the week before,'' Grimes said.
   Asked to assess the seriousness of drug and alcohol abuse at
nuclear power plants, he said: ``We've seen increasing evidence over
the past few years that we are getting positive tests and it is
involving reactor operators.
   ``I think last year we had, over the nation, perhaps eight to 10
cases where licensed operators had indications of positive drug
tests _ not of impairment on the job, but some relation to drugs.
   ``So we think it is a problem. It is not a widespread problem.
But I think we're not invulnerable to societal problems in this
industry, as with any other industry,'' Grimes said.
   During the briefing, officials told the commission that the staff
was proposing that the NRC regulation use threshold levels for
marijuana, cocaine and other drugs that have been determined by the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   For alcohol, the staff proposed using the same impairment level _
0.04 percent blood alcohol content _ set by the Department of
Transportation for testing programs involving transportation workers.

<HEAD>Needle Exchange to Combat AIDS Approved in Vancouver</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council has approved
a $100,000 program to provide free hypodermic syringes to
intraveneous drug users in an effort to combat the spread of AIDS.
   The program was adopted Tuesday at the urging of Dr. John
Blatherwick, the city's medical health officer, and calls for
distributing 10,000 needles a month. Health officials have cited the
re-use of needles by drug abusers as a leading cause of the spread
of AIDS among heterosexuals.
   To get a clean needle, a drug user must bring a used one to the
storefront office of the Downtown Eastside Youth Activities Society,
which has been distributing about 3,000 needles a month with funding
from donations.
   The program is similar to one adopted recently in Tacoma, Wash.,
which also began with a private needle exchange. A private group
distributes needles in New Haven, Conn., New York City, New Jersey
and Boston, and another group is trying to start a program to
distribute free needles in Portland, Ore.
   Alderman Don Bellamy, who voted against the proposal, said
Vancouver should stay out of the drug equipment supply business
despite the need to reduce the spread of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. Authorities should try to control drug problems, rather
than seeming to condone drug abuse by distributing free needles, he
said.

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent legislator has
published a book detailing charges of widespread police abuses,
saying most whites are unaware of government crackdowns against
black activists.
   Jan van Eck, considered the most left-wing member of the white
chamber of Parliament, cites repeated cases of alleged police
attacks on unarmed blacks in his book ``Eyewitness to Unrest.''
   Van Eck visited black townships near his Cape Town constituency
almost daily during the height of black unrest in 1985-86 and based
his book largely on those visits.
   Emergency regulations prohibit unauthorized reports about unrest
and police actions, although enforcement has not been comprehensive.
   Local and foreign reporters have written regularly about the
disturbances, which have calmed considerably in the past two years.
However, television footage of unrest that has appeared overseas has
not been shown on South Africa's state television network.
   ``In South Africa, white people, generally speaking, are totally
uninformed about what is happening (in black areas),'' van Eck said
in a recent interview after his book began appearing at stores.
``They do not know how (blacks) have been beaten, tear-gassed and
tortured.''
   In his book, van Eck cites an Aug. 10, 1985, incident in which
police used sjamboks, or whips, to break up a crowd attempting to
attend the funeral of a slain black activist.
   ``The sight of 50 sjambok-wielding policemen charging at 500
defenseless men, women and children and beating people left, right
and center froze me into semiparalysis,'' van Eck wrote. ``A more
peaceful crowd of 500 would have been difficult to find.''
   He also was present May 18, 1986, when black vigilantes attacked
homes of black anti-apartheid activists in a Cape Town township.
   ``(There) were virtually unanimous eyewitness accounts that the
security forces had not interfered when the vigilantes started their
attack,'' van Eck wrote. ``Witness upon witness reported that
(security forces) actively helped burn down shacks ...
   ``At every attempt by the (township residents) to move toward
their homes being torched by the vigilantes, the police would use
tear gas or buckshot to disperse them. I saw it myself,'' he wrote.
   Van Eck frequently raises controversial issues not discussed in
the mainstream of white political debate.
   He acknowledges much of his book violates emergency regulations,
but said he made no attempt to abide by them because ``the emergency
regulations are trying to prevent the truth from being told, from
people knowing the excessive amount of violence that is being used
by the state.''
   Van Eck accuses Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok of lying when
confronted with allegations of police misconduct.
   ``Once you have reached a situation in which a minister
repeatedly lies to Parliament, you have to start questioning the
whole system and whether you aren't in an early stage of anarchy,''
van Eck said.
   Local newspapers have reported the publication of the book, but
there's been no public response from the government. When asked for
comment, Law and Order Ministry spokesman Lt. P.F. Botma said the
ministry was aware of the book but had no comment about it.
   If the government bans his book, van Eck said he will read it
aloud in Parliament, where members are immune from prosecution for
statements made during official sessions.
   But van Eck said he believed the government ``will probably try
and ignore it and hope it will not be read by too many people.''

<TEXT>
   North Korean demands that South Korea
halt joint military maneuvers with the United States blocked
agreement Wednesday on holding further high-level talks.
   The communist government also said it will postpone talks
scheduled Friday between legislators of the two Koreas until the
military exercise ends.
   Teams led by vice ministers agreed to only one thing Wednesday _
to meet again March 2 in this Panmunjom truce village to try again
to negotiate the meeting of their prime ministers. Those talks would
be the highest level held between the rivals and are aimed at ending
44 years of confrontation since the peninsula was divided.
   Wednesday's meeting bogged down when the communists demanded an
``immediate halt'' to annual joint military exercises North Korea
claimed are ``an obstacle to dialogue.''
   Testy debate over the ``Team Spirit'' maneuvers clouded attempts
to discuss procedural matters or an agenda.
   Official Pyongyang Radio, monitored in Tokyo, said the
disagreements jeopardize future talks, and announced North Korea
will postpone a Friday meeting of legislators from both sides until
the exercises end.
   In Seoul, officials acknowledged hearing the broadcast but said
they have not received official notice postponing Friday's talks.
Nor did they know whether the March 2 meeting will be affected.
   Chief North Korean delegate Paik Nam Jun demanded soon after the
meeting opened that the joint exercise be stopped ``immediately and
unconditionally,'' charging they were ``war preparations.''
   South Korea's chief delegate, Song Han-ho, countered the
exercises are ``defensive'' and intended to prevent a ``possible
invasion.'' North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, starting a
three-year war.
   Song appealed to delegates to settle their differences.
   ``In the past 40-odd years, we have wasted national potentials as
we waged a war and persisted in confrontation and frictions despite
our being the same brethren,'' he said.
   There was a similar appeal from South Korean opposition leader
Kim Dae-Jung, who said in Rome that he is ``carefully optimistic''
about the talks.
   ``Both sides need to be more flexible,'' urged the leader of the
Party for Peace and Democracy. He said he is cultivating political
and economic contacts in Italy.
   After Wednesday's meeting, Paik and Song accused each other of
insincerity at separate news conferences.
   Song said he believed Pyongyang is trying to make its call for an
end to the joint maneuvers, a precondition for the prime ministerial
meeting.
   Paik said: ``The South Korean side did not show sincerity at
today's meeting. We hope they will come to the next meeting with a
sure answer.''
   This year's military exercises reportedly began last week,
athough there has been no official confirmation. About 200,000 U.S.
and South Korean troops took part in last year's maneuvers. The
exercises usually start in February and last about two months.
   Pyongyang long has called for a withdrawal of the 42,000 troops
the United States maintains in South Korea under a mutual defense
pact.

   Three students burned candles in a
restroom during what looked like a ritual, prompting the principal
to suspend the students and call the police.
   ``This is the first time anything like this has happened. It
completely shocked us,'' Burr Oak Junior-Senior High School
Principal Robert Peters said.
   ``We're not sure if this is an isolated case or if it's something
we should be worried about,'' Peters said. ``We don't know if the
girls were just experimenting with something or trying something
that they learned from someone else.''
   Three junior high school students were ``discovered conducting
some type of ritual or seance'' as they burned candles on sinks and
toilets in a school bathroom on Jan. 28, Peters said Tuesday.
   The girls were suspended for three days, and Peters asked Burr
Oak Police Chief Michael Ochanpaugh to investigate.
   ``There's no law that was broken. We're just working with the
school,'' Ochanpaugh said Wednesday. ``Just to turn your back on the
situation, to scoff it off, is not advisable.''
   He said he was calling other agencies and experts on seances.

<HEAD>Americans Usually Tough When Legislators Want a Pay Hike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress found out the hard way what many of its counterparts in
state capitals across the country already knew: Walk softly when
you're trying to stick a big pay raise in your pocket.
   True, legislators in Hawaii recently got a 73 percent increase,
but lawmakers in New Hampshire make $100 a year and haven't gotten a
raise since 1889.
   In Alaska, legislators got their pay cut in half to $22,140 in
1987, although they now get reimbursed for expenses. The same year,
Massachusetts voters rolled back a $10,999 legislative salary hike.
   In New Mexico, where legislators make $75 a day, they have
received only four raises since statehood in 1912, when the
compensation was $5 a day. In Rhode Island, the pay is still $5 a
day, and no one seems to know if or when there ever was a raise.
   The problem for lawmakers is summed up by state Rep. Bob Brawley
who tried unsuccessfully to double legislative pay in North Carolina
to $21,375.
   ``Everybody's going to use it for political fodder rather than
the realities of the pay scale,'' Brawley said.
   Asked if he would resurrect the issue, he joked, ``You want to
see everybody turn pale around here?''
   Congress, whose members are paid $89,500 a year, backed down on a
proposed 51 percent raise Tuesday after being set upon by
consre considered part-time. They
often supplement their legislative pay with salaries from regular
jobs. Still, they usually don't have time to earn outside money
while their legislature is meeting, and sessions are generally
getting longer.
   New York legislators are the highest paid in the nation at
$57,500, thanks to a 33.7 percent hike that went into effect this
year.
   Angry Massachusetts voters who rolled their legislators back to
$30,000 in 1987 did not remove them from the elite in legislative
pay. Only eight other states have scales above that: Illinois,
California, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and
New York.
   Hawaii's 73 percent increase last November took lawmakers from
$15,600 to $27,000, based on recommendations by a state salary
commission.
   In several states, such as Florida, legislative salaries are tied
to salaries of other state employees, so legislators get the same
average increase.
   The Florida system went into effect in 1986 to avoid the kind of
uproar that engulfed Congress. There was some controversy in 1985,
when salaries were raised for the first time in 16 years from
$12,000 to $18,000. Florida legislators now get $20,748.
   In California, where legislators are considered full-time, the
constitution allows a 5 percent salary increase a year. Legislators
make $40,816 a year plus $87 a session day for expenses, or about
$15,000 a year. They also get a state-leased car and gasoline credit
card. The other full-time legislatures are Massachusetts, Michigan
and Pennsylvania.
   Contrast that with neighboring Nevada, where legislative pay is
$130 a day, plus $66 for living expenses, but only for the first 60
days of the session. If the Legislature meets longer, they don't get
paid. The Nevada Legislature meets every other year and sessions
have run as long as 150 days.

   An American charter jet filled with
Italian tourists slammed into a fog-covered mountain in the Azores
today and exploded, and all 144 people on board were feared dead,
officials and news reports said.
   Maria della Versesi, a spokeswoman at the Italian Embassy in
Lisbon, said all 137 passengers were Italian and the seven crew
members were American. She did not release any names.
   The aircraft belonged to the U.S. airline Independent Air Corp.,
based in Smyrna, Tenn. The flight originated in Bergamo, Italy, and
was to have proceeded to Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, and
Montego Bay in Jamaica, after making a refueling stop in the Azores.
   The Portuguese news agency LUSA quoted an official from the
Azores Civil Protection Service as saying about 50 bodies had been
recovered and it appeared all on board died.
   LUSA also quoted an unidentified member of a local flying club as
saying all the passengers and crew had been killed.
   ``There are no survivors from the plane,'' the club member was
quoted as saying. ``But there do not appear to any victims on the
ground,'' he added.
   Afonso Pimentel, a LUSA reporter based in the Azores, said the
Boeing 707 was preparing to land at Santa Maria airport when it
crashed into Pico Alto, a fog-covered, 1,794-foot-high mountain, and
burst into flames.
   LUSA quoted the civil protection official, who was not
identified, as saying the pilot asked the airport to clear a runway
for an emergency landing. The Civil Protection Service is a state
body that provides rescue services and assistance in civilian
emergencies.
   Asked if there were any radio messages or warnings before the
plane went down, Gualder Cordero, the Santa Maria Airport
dispatcher, replied, ``No, no, no no.''
   Initial reports said the jet was bound for the United States.
   Officials in Lisbon said the Portuguese navy had sent planes and
ships carrying rescue crews and equipment to Santa Maria.
   A.L. Pittman, president of Independent Air Corp., said in an
interview in Smyrna that the 15-year-old company makes 400 to 500
charter flights a year, mostly in the Caribbean and Europe. Pittman,
who declined to identify the seven American crew members, said the
20-year-old jetliner that crashed had a relatively low number of
flight hours and no history of trouble.
   Pittman said the airplane, one of two Boeing 707s owned by the
company, had 12,500 cycles, or takeoffs and landings, and less than
50,000 hours in the air.
   Jack Barker, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Atlanta, said those figures were not unusually high for such an
airplane.
   ``If properly maintained, there should not be a problem because
of hours or number of cycles. Other aircraft involved in the news
have had as much as 50,000 cycles, a great many more,'' Barker said
in an interview.
   The Azores is a chain of 10 islands west of Portugal. Santa Maria
is 750 miles west of Portugal.
   Tom Cole of Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle said the plane
that crashed was one of two 707-320Bs delivered to TWA in February
and March 1968.
   Cole said he had no information on when Independent Air Corp. got
the planes from TWA or whether other companies owned the planes in
between TWA and Independent Air. Cole had no details on the planes'
service histories, except that at some point their engines were
adjusted to make them quieter.

<HEAD>Five-Year Extension On Import Curbs Sought; Critics Vow Fight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation to double the life span of a
five-year program to curb steel imports was introduced in the Senate
on Wednesday as critics claimed the quotas hurt the U.S. economy and
no longer are needed to protect domestic steelmakers.
   The bill, introduced by Sens. John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and
John Heinz, R-Pa., would extend the so-called voluntary restraint
agreements for another five years beyond their scheduled September
expiration.
   The restraint pacts, which currently cover 19 countries and the
European Community, first were negotiated in 1984 to protect the
beleaguered U.S. industry from foreign producers who were dumping
cheaper, subsidized steel.
   Domestic steelmakers since then have scaled down and modernized
their operations and rebounded. They earned more than $2 billion in
profits in 1988, operated at 96 percent of capacity and increased
productivity.
   Rockefeller said the fruits of the restraint agreements ``are
just beginning to be seen'' and that more time and investment is
needed before domestic steelmakers can compete without the import
limits.
   ``This is not protection for the industry,'' Rockefeller said.
``It is simply giving us a chance to survive and rebuild.''
   However, a coalition of more than 190 steel-using companies and
organizations announced it had organized to fight any extension of
the quotas, saying that continuing the restraints would do more harm
than good.
   The Coalition of American Steel Using Manufacturers released a
study by The Stern Group, an international trade advisory group,
which concluded that the quotas may help steelmakers in the short
term, but ``they burden steel-using industries, cost jobs, reduce
exports and slow economic growth.''
   ``We and our workers are paying a terrible price to protect the
U.S. steel industry,'' said Timothy L. Elder, of Caterpillar Inc. in
Peoria, Ill., a member of the coalition. ``We're paying through
higher prices ... than our foreign competitors are paying for their
steel. We're paying through availability problems that hamstring our
operations on the factory floor.''
   Paula Stern, a former chairwoman of the U.S. International Trade
Commission and president of The Stern Group, said the group's study
found that steel prices in the United States have risen 15 percent
overall since 1986 and up to 40 percent for some steel products.
   She said that because voluntary restraint agreements lead to
higher steel prices and steel shortages, extending them ``will hurt
America's manufacturing industries, stifle its export economy and
worsen the U.S. trade deficit.''
   Heinz maintained that charges the restraints have caused higher
prices and shortages are ``utterly without foundation.''
   The senators released a report by the Congressional Research
Service which found that foreign steelmakers did not fill their
quotas during the first half of last year and ``any domestic
increases in steel prices experienced after early in 1988 might not
be explained by the VRA quotas.''
   President Bush, during the fall campaign, said he would support
an extention of the import limits and Heinz said the president's
staff has reaffirmed his commitment to renew the program. The
legislation was introduced with support from 46 co-sponsors.

   NBC plans to make a television movie
based on Roxanne Pulitzer's saucy best-seller of her messy divorce,
``The Prize Pulitzer,'' the network said.
   An NBC publicist said Tuesday the TV movie would dramatize how
Ms. Pulitzer ``thought she'd been accepted into this fairy-tale
world only to be rejected and scorned when her marriage became a
national scandal.''
   During the highly publicized 1982 divorce trial, witnesses
testified about cocaine use, sexual affairs and occult
experimentation. Mrs. Pulitzer lost custody of their twin sons to
her husband, Peter.
   The film, scheduled for broadcast in May, will be directed by
Richard Colla, who has directed episodes of ``Miami Vice'' and
``Battlestar Galactica,'' NBC said.
   The project's production team is scouting 51 locations for the
movie, said Dale Eldridge, chief of the Mayor's Film and TV
Commission in Jacksonville. Casting has not been made final, NBC
said.

   Singer Barbara Mandrell says gospel music
is her first love although she's better known for her country hits.
   ``Country music is my bread and butter, which I love second to
gospel music,'' the entertainer said Tuesday at a news conference
announcing finalists for the 1989 awards presented by the Gospel
Music Association.
   Miss Mandrell, who is wrapping up a gospel music album, is known
for such songs as ``I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool'' and
``Sleeping Single in a Double Bed.'' She and her two sisters starred
in a network TV variety show in 1980 and 1981.

   Singer Charlene Neville, whose father
and uncle comprise the Neville Brothers, is hoping 1989 will be her
year in the spotlight.
   ``For a long time I was almost unknown except in New Orleans. But
in the last four or five years, things have rocketed,'' said Ms.
Neville.
   Ms. Neville, appearing at Caesars Atlantic City this weekend,
said two high points in her career occurred in 1988. Time magazine,
cataloging the bright spots of the Republican Convention in New
Orleans, awarded her the title Best Set of Lungs. She also landed a
cameo in the film ``Everybody's All-American.''
   ``Now there's talk of me working in the story of Ray Charles and
there's whispers that I may be in the story of Tina Turner. I like
all those whispers,'' said Ms. Neville, whose musical style combines
elements of classical, reggae, R&amp;B, and jazz.

   Fed up with fame and overdosed on tourists
after the tenure of Mayor Clint Eastwood, some residents tried to
stop Henry Winkler and Tom Hanks from making a Disney movie in this
coastal village.
   The showdown came Tuesday night when the City Council granted
Disney a permit to film outdoor scenes of the action comedy ``Turner
and Hooch'' on five days in April. The film stars Hanks, Mare
Winningham and a big dog named Beasley. Winkler will direct.
   Neither Winkler nor Hanks appeared at the meeting. Instead,
location manager Eric Johnson and production manager Michele Ader
fielded questions from neighborhood associations.
   Although some residents complained the filming would disrupt life
and attract unwanted tourists, others praised Disney as a
``quality'' outfit and said the film would be a community project
because local extras would be used.

   Television talk show host Morton
Downey Jr. was casino-hopping last week, but his motive was
business, not pleasure.
   Downey, who bid on Del Webb's Claridge Casino Hotel last month,
now has his eye on Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel, a struggling
property on the Boardwalk that has been for sale since 1985,
Atlantis officials confirmed on Tuesday.
   ``I was very encouraged by the reception I received at the
Atlantis and I was pleasantly surprised with the property itself,''
Downey said earlier this week. He toured the gaming hall and met
with casino executives last Wednesday and Thursday, said Atlantis
spokesman Robert Arrow.
   Downey and his investment group had placed a $120 million bid on
the Claridge, but face strong competition from an investment group
that includes former casino executive Alfred Luciani.
   The entertainer said he is reviewing Atlantis' financial and
structural reports, ``then I'll see where I'm heading. But I
definitely am sincerely willing, financially capable and very
anxious to own and operate a casino in Atlantic City.''

Kennedy, has resigned as a weekly newspaper editor and says he plans
to write a book.
   Kilduff, 60, resigned last week as editor of The Beattyville
Enterprise after working for the newspaper for 7{ years. He wrote in
his final column that he and his wife, Rosemary, planned to write a
book about their government careers. Mrs. Kilduff is a retired U.S.
Senate aide.
   Kilduff was an assistant White House press secretary in 1963 and
was serving as acting press secretary for the first time on a
presidential trip when Kennedy went on a political fence-mending
tour of Texas. After shots rang out in Dallas, Kilduff appeared at a
hastily arranged hospital news conference to tell the world that the

<HEAD>Marx Wrong, Private Property OK, Soviet Economist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stalinist socialism and key parts of Marxist theory
are wrong or outdated, and the Soviet Union will start selling
private homes and land, a leading Soviet economist said Wednesday.
   Oleg Bogomolov also said ``the Stalinist system was borrowed or
imposed on other countries,'' and that other socialist countries
should choose their own way of repairing the damage.
   The Soviet Union's looming $160 billion 1990 budget deficit is
``a major stumbling block'' for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
program of perestroika, Bogomolo said at a Foreign Ministry news
conference.
   He said it might be solved by selling state-owned land to
individuals, and by importing video recorders and personal computers
and taxing them at up to 10 times their value in the West.
   Scarce video recorders sell for about $6,400 to $11,200 in the
Soviet Union. Personal computers cost about $48,000 to $112,000.
   Bogomolov, the director of the Institute of World Socialist
System Economy, came close to apologizing to the Soviet bloc for
saddling them with Stalinism, ``which failed to withstand the test
of time.''
   ``Non-interference in internal affairs and respect for the
econonic interests of each other are equally important as in the
past but now are realized more fully,'' he said. ``Perhaps there
were some violations.''
   Now, he said, ``we still adhere to Marxist theories, but so much
of this theory should be adjusted because many of the theories of
Marx failed to stand the test of time.''
   Socialist countries are now trying their own ways, he said.
``Diversity of experience and views is not a sign of weakness but a
source of power,'' he said.
   In response to a question, he said that Hungary theoretically
could turn further capitalistic in economics without leaving the
Warsaw Pact, and even a politically neutral Hungary would not
threaten Soviet security.
   He said the Soviet Union had found banning private property left
farmers with no concern for the land and long-term development. He
predicted that the pending legalization of family farms will go
further than previously stated, and allow them to choose their own
crops and sell them at market prices.
   Right now, however, ``there is no free market for agricultural
implements, or where agricultural produce is traded,'' because
farmers are told what to grow and must sell it at prices set by
bureaucrats.
   The Soviet Union is looking to the farming system of Hungary in
hopes of restoring ``the farmer's interest in investing in the
land'' since he does not own it, Bogomolov said. He predicted
long-term _ ``even lifetime'' _ leases on farmland, and outright
sale of plots for private houses.
   ``We have many plots of land and many who would like to buy
them,'' to build homes, summer dachas or cooperative apartments. He
indicated that would satisfy a populace disgusted with a perennial
housing shortage, sop up excess savings and help solve the
government budget deficit.
   Bogomolov won attention several weeks ago for revealing the
Soviet budget deficit will exceed the U.S. deficit next year, even
though the Soviet economy is one-third the size of the American one.
   He rejected the suggestion of other economists that the Soviet
Union must use Western credit to buy foreign goods to calm consumers
increasingly unhappy with shortages.
   ``The Soviet Union has extended its debt to a dangerous limit,''
he said, and further borrowing risks imitation of Poland's economic
crisis.
   Instead, he suggested paying Soviet farmers half the hard
currency now spent on foreign grain. ``We'll have much more wheat,''
he said, ``and we could use the rest of the hard currency on
consumer goods.''
   He also said production of Soviet consumer goods is being
doubled, partially through conversion of defense plants. He
suggested abandoning ``costly projects, including oil-processing
projects in Siberia and the Caspian Sea region,'' whose efficiency
is ``doubtful.''
   Multinational firms, once derided in the Soviet press as the
worst excess of capitalism, will soon spread their presence across
socialist countries, the economist said. Even Aeroflot, the Soviet
monopoly airline, could get some competition if foreign airlines are
authorized routes within the U.S.S.R., he said.

   A state House committee shot down a
tongue-in-cheek bill calling for 100 of the geese that winter on the
lake outside the Capitol building to sacrifice their lives to
finance a fancy legislative retreat.
   ``I think you could call this a golden goose of legislation,''
Rep. Roger Porch, a sponsor of the joke bill, said Tuesday as fowl
puns and charges of featherbedding flew higher than migrating geese.
``I hope the committee will take a good gander at this bill.''
   The measure called for a special hunting season that would allow
100 out-of-state residents to pay $10,000 apiece for licenses
permitting them to kill a Capitol Lake goose. The revenue would be
used to build a hunting lodge for lawmakers on nearby Oahe
Reservoir, Porch said.
   By the end of each legislative session, lawmakers need a retreat
because they suffer from shaking hands, ringing ears and blurred
vision and are just basically down, said Porch.
   ``It's known as goose down. Some people actually quack up,'' the
lawmaker said.
   The bill's other sponsor, Rep. Ed Olson, said he had polled the
geese on the lake and they assured him they were willing to take
part in the special season. To back Olson's claim, a woman dressed
up in a goose costume urged the House Agriculture and Natural
Resources Committee to approve the special hunting season.
   ``If anyone is dumb enough to pay $10,000 for a hunting license,
are they going to be able to shoot any of us?'' said the goose,
introduced as Gloria Gander. ``I don't think so.''

   Two black bear clubs
apparently abandoned by their mother are thriving on goat's milk,
baby formula and lots of human attention.
   The week-old female cubs, about the size of a palm, were
discovered by loggers Mike Dumoulin and Carman Watson two weeks ago
after a falling tree disturbed their den near Terrace, about 430
miles northwest of Vancouver, British Columbia. The mother never
returned.
   ``They would have died if we hadn't taken them,'' Dumoulin said
Tuesday.
   Each logger took one of the blind, bald cubs home with him, with
Watson christening his Little Bear and Dumoulin naming his Baby.
   The bears' bare bottoms are wrapped in diapers, and they are fed
goat's milk and baby formula every four hours.
   ``When Mike brought this bawling baby home I just had to help it
fight for its life,'' said Dumoulin's wife, Melanie.
   ``The cub sounds and responds just like a baby. She likes her
tummy rubbed. And there are dirty diapers to wash, of course.''
   It is illegal to take an animal from the wild, but ``in Mike's
case he had a valid reason,'' said Terrace conservation officer
Terry McGunigle.
   The cubs will be sent to the Vancouver Game Farm next month.

<HEAD>U.S. Teens Start Educational Tour in Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Seventeen Maine high school students on Wednesday
began a 13-day visit to Vietnam to learn about the country and the
war in which some of their fathers fought.
   ``The students will be questioning people on the streets,
visiting schools and hospitals. ... They'll have free time to go out
and get information on their own as well,'' Stephen Knight, a
history teacher from Fairfield, said in a telephone interview from
Hanoi.
   ``No one's telling them if the war was right or wrong. They'll
make that decision for themselves,'' he added.
   He said the visit to Vietnam by American students is one of the
first of its kind.
   The United States has no diplomatic relations with Hanoi's
communist government, whose forces defeated the U.S.-backed former
South Vietnamese government in 1975.
   Knight said about half of the students' fathers had fought in
Vietnam.
   ``I've been teaching about the Vietnam War for some time and it's
the one thing the students want to learn about most,'' Knight said.
   For the American teen-agers, ``the Vietnam War really is
meaningful'' as a chapter of American history that textbooks rarely
include, he said.
   ``American textbooks are awful. They don't deal with the war at
all,'' Knight said.
   The students, who arrived in Hanoi on Wednesday, will be
collecting material on subjects ranging from education and rice
farming to the effects of the herbicide Agent Orange, sprayed over
Vietnam by the U.S. military, he said.
   The students, who average about 17 years old, have been studying
Vietnam for a year in a special accredited history class taught by
Knight on weekends. They come from four different high schools in
the Portland, Maine, area.
   Knight made arrangements for the tour during a visit to Hanoi a
year ago and through the Vietnam Mission at the United Nations in
New York. Two other teachers, three Vietnam War veterans and a
college student also are on the tour.

   A former Nazi SS soldier who leads a
growing extremist party told thousands of cheering supporters
Wednesday that young Germans bear no guilt for Hitler's
extermination of 6 million Jews.
   Franz Schoenhuber, an SS soldier in World War II, also criticized
the president of the nation's Jewish community, called for the
reunification of Germany and said the European Economic Community
was detrimental to German farmers.
   In a speech to several thousand supporters of his Republican
Party, which has surged in national polls, the 66-year-old
politician denied being anti-Semitic.
   There are Jewish authors, composers and painters ``I like,'' he
said, ``but I don't like Mr. Galinski.''
   Heinz Galinski, who is 76 and survived the Auschwitz death camp,
constantly reminds West Germans of the horrors of the Hitler era and
criticizes anti-Jewish tendencies of the extreme right wing.
   ``Mr. Galinski sabotages German-Jewish reconciliation,''
Schoenhuber said. Galinski told The Associated Press by telephone
from his home in West Berlin: ``There will be no comment from me
because it is beneath my dignity to argue with Mr. Schoenhuber.''
   Schoenhuber fought in France and on the Eastern front in World
War II, then spent 1{ years as a prisoner of the British. The SS, or
Schutzstaffel, was a military unit of the Nazi party and separate
from the regular German army.
   At the meeting in Cham, a town of 16,000 people 80 miles
northeast of Munich, he pounded his fist on the rostrum and
declared: ``Today's young generation of Germans is no more guilty
for Auschwitz than the sons and daughters of Americans who committed
genocide at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.''
   More than 5,000 supporters, feasting on beer and sausages in the
packed hall, interrupted Schoenhuber's two-hour speech frequently
with applause and shouts of ``Bravo!'' A Bavarian brass band played
before and after the speech.
   Particularly strong reactions greeted the leader's statements
that ``we are proud to be Germans,'' and ``we are a law and order
party.''
   The Republican Party got 7.5 percent of the vote in West Berlin
elections Jan. 29, gaining 11 seats in the city legislature. Its
success in Berlin automatically qualifies it for two seats in the
federal parliament in Bonn after the elections in December 1990.
   A poll released last week by the respected Wickert Institute said
the party, founded in 1983, would get 11.5 percent of the national
vote if elections were held now.
   Schoenhuber said one of his goals is unifying West Germany with
the communist East and making Berlin the nation's capital again. He
said the party is ``for Europe but against this European Economic
Community.''
   He said the EEC helps farmers in Greece, Spain and Portugal, but
does nothing for those in West Germany.
   Demonstrators protested peacefully earlier in the day, but no
incidents were reported at the three-hour rally.
   Small groups outside the hall whistled and shouted ``Nazis out!''
Police said a few dozen people gathered in protest at a downtown
square.
   About 30 people tried to block Schoenhuber's entry to the hall by
placing chairs and musical instruments in his way. Police arrested
eight who tried to unfurl banners with slogans against the party.
   Shoenhuber, a former journalist, criticized the news media for
``biased coverage'' of his party.
   ``The Nazis brought us the worst chapter of our history,'' he
said. ``We don't want another Hitler, but we can't allow our history
to be reduced to Auschwitz.''
   He repeated the party's call for sending home millions of West
Germany's foreign workers and people from the Third World who seek
asylum.
   ``We are not hostile to foreigners, but we are friendly to the
Germans,'' Schoenhuber said.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's Seen No Evidence Causing Him to Lose Confidence in
Tower</HEAD>

   President Bush said today he has seen no
evidence that would cause him to lose confidence in Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower, whose Senate confirmation vote has
been delayed for at least 10 days.
   Senior Democrats on the Armed Services Committee said earlier
that the FBI was reviewing allegations about the former Texas
senator's finances.
   ``Have I seen anything, or has anything in the FBI report made me
want to change my mind as one who would be concerned about
insobriety or about failure to be ready for duty 24 hours a day? The
answer is no, I have not,'' Bush said.
   ``I have seen nothing, not one substantive fact, that makes me
change my mind about John Tower's ability to be secretary of defense
and be a very good one,'' Bush said.
   ``If somebody else sees the evidence that they want to interpret
differently, that's not only their right but their obligation,'' he
said.
   Bush said he was not criticizing the investigation process but
was upset that unsubstantiated rumors were being circulated and were
hurting Tower.
   ``What's gone too far is allegations that the senators themselves
would agree are totally unfounded, to have been floated around for a
long period of time and damaged the integrity and honor of a decent
man. And that is not good,'' he said.
   ``And everyone here knows it's not fair,'' he added.
   Bush was asked to explain how some senators reviewing the same
material he has seen have expressed reservations about the
nomination.
   ``Then my appeal would be, if you've made up your mind, let the
process go forward. Let's have the vote... they have an obligation
to vote their conscience,'' Bush said.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the new
allegation ``relates to Sen. Tower's activities while he was in the
Senate.'' He refused to elaborate but said President Bush still
stands by Tower and expects that he will be confirmed.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services Committee chairman, told
reporters he could not vote to confirm Tower until the latest
allegations were checked, and said he had told President Bush that
at a White House meeting on Tuesday night.
   ``I told the president frankly that I have serious concerns, and
I also stated that if a vote was held immediately as some have
urged, I would vote no because of these concerns,'' Nunn told
reporters.
   ``There are new allegations of a financial nature which are now
being checked in the Tower nomination,'' he said.
   The administration had been pushing for a vote this week but
dropped the request after Nunn and the ranking Republican on the
Armed Services panel, Sen. John Warner of Virginia, met with Bush.
``They really can't vote until this matter is checked out,''
Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Nunn's assertion that he would vote against
Tower if a vote were held now was ``disappointing, very
disappointing.''
   The second-ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. James Exon of
Nebraska, said the latest FBI report on Tower could not be complete
by Friday, when the Senate is scheduled to begin a week-long recess.
   ``As a practical matter, they can't draw it out too long,'' Exon
told reporters.
   The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, said on the
floor of the Senate that all members of that body wanted a chance to
thoroughly review the FBI report on Tower, and therefore, ``I don't
see how it is possible to bring the matter to a vote this week.''
   Republicans immediately rushed to defend the nominee.
   The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, said in response to
Mitchell that he had spoken with Tower on the telephone this morning
and found him ``upbeat about the nomination.''
   ``He is aware of the new allegation,'' said Dole, adding that
Tower thinks his nomination should be confirmed and ``he is hanging
in there.''
   Another Republican on the committee, William Cohen of Maine, said
that ``once these remaining questions are answered, (Tower) will
have considerable support, bipartisan support, both of the committee
and on the Senate floor.''
   And Cohen cautioned against allowing the Tower nomination to turn
into a ``partisan wrangle'' between Democrats and Republicans.
   ``Frankly, that would not bode well certainly for relations with
the administration, but it wouldn't bode well for the Congress of
the United States itself, especially here in the Senate,'' he said.
   Exon said that allegations continued to flow concerning Tower's
drinking and financial affairs, but that he would not know the
specifics until the FBI report is complete.
   ``Ninety percent of the allegations are garbage,'' said Exon,
specifically disputing a rumor that Tower had an affair with a
dancer who had defected from the Soviet bloc.
   The remaining allegations, he said, concerned Tower's drinking
habits and his ability to avoid a conflict of interest with defense
contractors from whom he collected more than $1 million as a
consultant.
   Asked by reporters whether Tower's alcohol consumption was his
chief concern, Nunn said:
   ``I don't want to categorize it like that. That's one of my
primary concerns. The question there is whether there has been an
alcohol abuse problem. If there has been a problem in the past, is
there a point where it has been recognized by the nominee and dealt
with effectively. That is to say, is it a continuing problem? I do
not have an answer to that yet.''
   He added, ``It's not a matter of one or two episodes, it's a
question of whether there's a continuing pattern. ... It's a matter
of a person in the chain of command that has control over the
arsenal of the United States of America. ... The secretary of
defense has to, in my view, have clarity of thought at all times.
   Tower went to the White House this morning for a regularly
scheduled breakfast with Secretary of State James A. Baker and
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft in Scowcroft's office,
said Fitzwater. Bush did not attend.
   The meeting, at about 7:30 a.m. was in continuing a tradition set
during the Reagan administration when then-national security adviser
Colin Powell met for regular breakfasts with the secretary of state
and defense secretary.
   As Tower was at the White House, Nunn told reporters on Capitol
Hill that presidential consel ``Boyden Gray has informed me that the
White House now agrees that the committee should not vote on his
confirmation.''
   The open criticism of Tower by his former Senate colleagues was
extraordinary. Senators rarely are willing to speak about the
personal behavior of their colleagues. Tower, a Texas Republican,
chaired the Armed Services Committee from 1981 through 1984.
   ``At this stage, there's no doubt about it, there are serious
questions remaining,'' said Nunn.
   The committee had originally hoped to vote on the confirmation
last week, then had counted on taking up the confirmation today
after receiving what was to have been the final FBI report before
the new allegation surfaced.
   The president told Nunn that Tower was an ``excellent nominee and
hoped there'd be a vote soon,'' Fitzwater said. ``He (Nunn) did not
speak out against it or ask that it be withdrawn.''
   Warner had said earlier in the day that he had been briefed by
the White House about what was expected to be the final FBI inquiry
before the new allegation. He, in turn, briefed the GOP members of
the committee.
   The GOP senators said a preliminary FBI report provided no
grounds to disqualify Tower.
   But the separate GOP briefings angered Nunn, and may have helped
push the Democrats toward opposition.
   ``Obviously, there have been some unofficial briefings going on
that I as chairman of the committee have not been part of,'' Nunn
said.

   A U.S. trade mission to Egypt and North Yemen
is being planned for spring to help promote agricultural trade and
development, an Agriculture Department official said Wednesday.
   Undersecretary Roland S. Vautour said the actual dates for the
trip still have to be negotiated with the two countries.
   The mission will include representatives from the Agriculture
Department, State Department and the U.S. Agency for International
Development. Three to six representatives from outside government
also will be named to the team, he said.
   Congress authorized the missions program in December 1987 to
encourage greater U.S. private and foreign country participation in
agricultural trade and development activities.
   A previously announced mission will visit Kenya and the Ivory
Coast in March, and one recently returned from Algeria and Tunisia.
Last year, visits were made to the Philippines, Indonesia, Hong
Kong, Singapore and Mexico.

Says</HEAD>

   The AIDS virus may become a permanent part of
the American scene, a report said Wednesday, unless those most at
risk change their sexual activities and drug habits. To do that, the
study called for a massive survey of the most intimate details of
life in the United States.
   The report by the National Research Council called for AIDS blood
tests from key elements of the population, including newborns and
women seeking abortions, improved sex education techniques among the
young, ``safe injection'' education for drug users and more frank
communication about AIDS on television networks.
   Most importantly, though, the study said that without more
knowledge about the activities of homosexuals, prostitutes, drug
users _ and even ordinary citizens _ other efforts stand little
chance of success.
   ``Our committee believes that the public health threat posed by
AIDS is so great that we must find ways to overcome social and
cultural taboos that stand in the way of improved AIDS prevention,
and we must do so quickly,'' Lincoln E. Moses, a Stanford University
professor who chaired the NRC committee, said at a news conference.
   The study's director, Charles F. Turner, said that researchers
``are tripping continually over massive deficiencies in our
understanding of the basic behaviors by which (the virus) is spread.
Those deficiencies have to be filled if we are going to do better 10
years from now in controlling the transmission of this deadly
disease.''
   The committee said the battle against AIDS may extend into the
22nd Century, even if a medical cure is found. Moses noted that a
cure _ antibiotics _ was developed 40 years ago for many sexually
transmitted diseases that remain major public health problems.
   Already, the report said, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
is ``substantially seeded in the U.S. population _ the number of
people who are now infected may surpass 1 million _ and the virus is
likely to continue to spread, if not in epidemic form, then in a
persistent, more stable endemic form.''
   ``This disease is only spread by social behavior,'' said Moses.
``We have no weapon to combat the spread of HIV other than modifying
our behavior. Someday the virologists will find an effective therapy
or vaccine, but it will remain largely a social disease.''
   Proposed were ``vigorous programs'' of research into American
sexual habits, including sex outside of marriage, between people of
the same gender, with people of both genders, with prostitutes, and
``variations in sexual techniques among the various types of sexual
partnerings.''
   It also said the sexual habits of people who inject drugs should
be studied.
   With enough survey data, Moses said, programs can be designed to
discourage unsafe sex and drug practices ``in clear, explicit
language in the idiom of the target audience.''
   ``We now have an epidemic in which we have a great need for an
undersanding of sexual behaviors of all types, including those that
don't deal with procreation,'' Turner said.
   The panel said that moral education alone, an approach favored by
many in the Reagan administration, will not be effective in
controlling sexual behavior.
   Said committee member Marshall H. Becker:
   ``If the major emphasis is placed on `just say no,' it is a sort
of moral meanspiritedness we are engaged in where we are, in effect,
saying `if you refuse to play the game, die.'
   ``That is a terrible stance to take,'' said Becker. ``We owe it
to the young people of our nation to give them more options than
that.''
   He said the war on AIDS should have a moral component, but he
said it would effectively reach only ``a limited number of
individuals.''
   Instead, said Becker, the panel recommended plain-language
education campaigns that would give teen-age Americans options to
encourage the use of condoms and other ``safe sex'' practices.
   Indeed, the council recommended that condoms be ``readily
available to all sexually active persons'' and that a study be
conducted to determine how effective condoms and spermicides are in
lowering the risk of HIV infection.
   The 589-page study, ``AIDS _ Sexual Behavior and Interavenous
Drug Use'', includes these recommendations, among others:
   _Expanded programs to teach ``safe injection'' techniques to drug
users. Needle-sharing among drug users is thought to be a major way
in which AIDS is spread.
   _Treatment for all sexually transmitted diseases that are thought
to speed the spread of AIDS.
   _More public service messages on the television networks dealing
with methods of avoiding AIDS.
   _Acceptance by the networks of condom advertisements.
   AIDS destroys the body's immune system and its ability to fight
infection; patients usually die of infections or cancers.
   The disease is usually spread through sexual contact, but can
also be transmitted through contact with infected blood and blood
products and given by a a pregnant woman to her child.
   Most of the victims in the United States are homosexuals or
intravenous drug users.
   The National Research Council is an arm of the National Academy
of Sciences, a private, nonprofit group that advises the government
on scientific matters.

   The Associated Press erred Saturday in
reporting the length of film used in an average movie. The error
occurred in a story about the 100th anniversary of Eastman Kodak
Co.'s motion-picture film products.
   The average movie film, at 90 feet of film per minute, is about
9,000 to 12,000 feet long.
   Kodak estimates filmmakers use at least 20 times more negative
film than the finished product requires, which means an average
movie might use 180,000 to 240,000 feet of film. If 1,000 prints are
needed, a studio must buy 9 million feet to 12 million feet of print
film.

<TEXT>
   The Asian bull elephant that crushed to death
a trainer at Busch Gardens will be spared, but will be sold to a
facility better equipped to handle a growing, three-ton pachyderm.
   Officials at the African theme park have agreed to sell Casey,
the 17-year-old elephant that killed handler Joe Allen, 34, Sunday
as he led the elephant back to its pen.
   ``We certainly don't want to handle him here anymore,'' park
public releations director Glenda Gilmore said Tuesday.
   Gilmore said Casey's owner, Roman Schmitt, will try to find
someone interested in buying him.
   Allen's widow, Mattie Allen, expressed some satisfaction over the
decision,
   ``Thank God he's leaving,'' she said. ``I'd rather they'd killed
it, but if they ship it away from Busch Gardens, I'm glad.''
   Witnesses say Allen either tripped, or was pushed down by the
elephant's trunk. The bull dipped his head, placed it against the
handler's chest and pushed down.
   Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials
are investigating, but didn't immediately determine whether Busch
Gardens should be held accountable, to an OSHA spokesman.
   But some specialists say it will not be easy to find a buyer for
a male pachyderm that has killed a person.
   ``The best way to handle these bull elephants _ the only safe way
_ is to keep them separate, and don't handle them,'' said Mike
Schmidt, a veterinarian who works with elephants at the Washington
Park Zoo in Portland, Ore. ``A lot of those bulls are like ticking
clocks, waiting to go off. It's a calculated risk.''
   Portland officials often get up to $50,000 for a 2-year-old
female calf, and less for the unpredictable bull calves, Schmidt
said. An older bull may be worth even less, especially if it has
killed someone.
   Schmitt brought the elephant to Busch Gardens four months ago as
a second breeding bull. He bought it last year from a Texas man who
used Casey for rides at circuses.

   North Korea and Cuba were designated Wednesday
by a top State Department official as the world's worst human rights
violators in 1988 because of their efforts to convert their people
into ``automatons'' through repressive mechanisms.
   ``What we are talking about here is total repression,'' said
Assistant Secretary of State Richard Schifter, who spoke on the
occasion of the release of the State Department's annual human
rights report.
   At a news conference, Schifter likened North Korea to a
``nightmare state'' where ``the government tries really to turn
people into automatons.''
   ``As far as Cuba is concerned, there is an effort there to try to
achieve the same thing in terms of total penetration of the country
by secret police truly spying on every citizen,'' he said.
   Schifter acknowledged that other analysts who judge regimes by
the number of government-sponsored killings of political opponents
would be less critical of Cuba.
   He conceded that he is unaware of any such killings in Cuba in
1988. The country with the largest number of killings in 1988, he
said, was Sudan, where there was large-scale starvation because
government and opposition forces refused to allow emergency food
deliveries to refugees in contested areas.
   The Cuban diplomatic mission here said in reply to Schifter's
comments that the ``United States has no international mandate and,
even less, the moral authority to judge or give opinions about the
internal situation in Cuba.
   ``We therefore attribute no importance to the opinions that the
State Department may have about our country.''
   President Fidel Castro has said that Cuba has the world's most
enviable human rights record because of the gains Cuba has made in
such areas as health and education and in maintaining unemployment
at low levels.
   Castro also has said that a vigilant attitude among his people
must be maintained because of numerous U.S. threats against Cuba and
the many American-sponsored sabotage and assassination attempts.
   The section on North Korea in the human rights report said North
Korea subjects its people to rigid controls.
   The report said the regime establishes security ratings for every
resident that determine access to employment, schools, medical
facilities and stores as well as admission to the ruling party.
   The report added that the government imprisons people ``who fail
to conform to the dictates of the state and often exiles them
together with their families to remote villages.''
   On Cuba, the report said mass organizations attempt to extend
Cuban government and Communist Party control over each citizen's
daily activities at home, work and school.
   ``Citizens are exhorted to ensure ideological conformity and to
report deviation,'' it said.

<HEAD>Studies Find Devices Effective In Saving Sea Turtles Caught In Nets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trap doors on shrimp nets save the lives of
sea turtles, but they also cause a significant reduction in the
shrimpers' catch, studies show.
   The studies presented at a sea turtle conference Wednesday showed
the Turtle Excluder Devices, called TEDs, are effective in releasing
sea turtles from shrimpers' nets, but led to a loss of about 8
percent in the shrimp catch.
   State regulations mandating use of the devices went into effect
in many inshore waters Feb. 1, while federal regulations making TEDs
mandatory go into effect May 1.
   The preliminary results of the studies were presented at the 9th
annual Workshop on Sea Turtle Conservation and Biology, being held
through Saturday on Jekyll Island. Fourteen nations are represented.
   A TED is a barrier in the narrow neck of a shrimper's
funnel-shaped net which guides things too large to get through, such
as large fish or sea turtles, out a trap door in the top or bottom
of the net. Shrimp pass through the barrier to be trapped in the
basket at the bottom of the funnel.
   In a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration study, no
sea turtles were captured in nets equipped with TEDs, while 24
turtles were caught in nets without the devices, said Ed Klima of
the agency. Two of the 24 died before they could be released.
   Observers who have spent 307 days on shrimp boats along the
Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico, near the midpoint of the
projected 700-day project, also found the devices resulted in an
average loss of about 8 percent of the shrimp catch.
   But, Klima added, ``I see that coming out pretty close to zero
with experience by the fishing crew.''
   In a separate study by the University of Georgia Marine Extension
Service, scientists found an 8{ percent reduction in the shrimp
harvest, said D. Kendall, who was optimistic shrimpers will find a
solution to the problem.
   ``Sea turtles are something shrimpers don't want to catch,''
Kendall said. ``They're a pain to have to deal with on the deck of
the boat.''

   U.S. officials sought to assure Congress
Wednesday that Soviet Jews and people from Vietnam are not in
competition for admission to refugee status in America.
   ``Numbers are not going to be a problem,'' and East Asian
refugees are not going to be pitted against East European refugees
for U.S. entry, said Ambassador Jonathan Moore, U.S. coordinator for
refugee affairs.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee's subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs,
raised the issue at a hearing.
   Solarz asked Moore if he meant that ``not a single Vietnamese
will be obliged to remain behind who otherwise would have been able
to leave'' his homeland but for the transfer of 6,500 U.S. refugee
entry slots from Asians to East Europeans at the end of last year.
   ``That's correct,'' Moore replied. He said the Vietnamese
government is processing emigrants under its ``orderly departure
program'' at a pace that rendered the 6,500 slots surplus at the end
of 1988. They were used for Soviet and East European refugees after
the Soviet Union relaxed its departure rules for Jews and others
long waiting to leave.
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told the subcommittee that she and
others in Congress have written to President Bush and Secretary of
State James A. Baker III opposing reductions in resettlement
programs involving Vietnamese.
   The 1989 ceiling of 19,500 Vietnamese entrants compares with
7,000 last year. ``Thus movements out of Vietnam will increase
dramatically over those of last year,'' said Moore.
   The 1989 U.S. refugee quota has been set at 94,000 worldwide.

   A wild golden eagle was recovering
Wednesday from surgery on both wings after it was found shot, and
veterinarians concentrated on building up the feeble bird's strength.
   State and federal authorities sought the public's help in
determining who shot the bird in southern Kentucky.
   ``It's in a very poor nutritional state,'' said Dr. Loran Wagoner
of the Skyline Animal Clinic. ``It apparently had been shot for
about a week before it was caught.''
   The adult male, 10 pounds with a 6-foot wingspan, was found
Tuesday by three state highway department employees near Sharon
Grove. The workers turned the wounded bird over to Sgt. Gerald
Barnett of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife in Elkton.
   Four veterinarians performed surgery on the eagle at the animal
clinic.
   ``The upper bones in both wings were broken'' when the eagle was
hit with buckshot, Wagoner said. ``We have intramedullary pins
holding the bones tight. It will be a matter of him strengthening
his bones again before he can fly.''
   Of more immediate concern to Wagoner is building the eagle's
strength so it can be taken to the Louisville Zoo for recovery.
   ``Right now, we're trying to feed him chicken parts and beef,''
he said. ``We've managed to get a little bit down by force-feeding
him.''
   Wagner said it's important that the eagle be transferred to the
zoo soon.
   ``They lose the will to live,'' he explained. ``Even though the
zoo has a controlled environment, it is more familiar to the bird.
It's important not to handle them any more than necessary.''
   Although the bird is weak, its ability to perch is a good
indicator that it may recover, Wagoner said.
   Barnett said a substantial reward would be offered for
information on the shooting. Shooting a golden eagle or a bald eagle
carries a federal penalty of up to a $100,000 fine or one year in
prison.

<HEAD>West Germany High Court Affirms Convictions in Nazi `Mercy Killings'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's highest court on
Wednesday affirmed the convictions of two elderly doctors for taking
part in the Nazis' ``mercy killing'' of more than 11,500 handicapped
people.
   The ruling ended one of the last major Nazi-related trials in
West Germany and closed out 28 years of criminal proceedings against
Dr. Aquilin Ulrich and Dr. Heinrich Bunke.
   In May 1987, a Frankfurt court convicted Ulrich and Bunke of
accessory to murder for participating in the killing of thousands of
people, most of them mentally retarded, during 1940 and 1941.
   Ulrich and Bunke, both now 74 years old, claimed they were
following orders as part of the Nazis' ``Euthanasia Action,'' which
also was aimed at some physically handicapped people.
   The Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe ruled there was proof
Bunke took part in the gas-chamber deaths of at least 9,200 patients
and that Ulrich killed at least 2,340 people.
   While affirming the convictions of accessory to murder, the court
also ordered the original sentence of four years reduced to three
years for each doctor.
   ``Both doctors are now free, as they were throughout their
trial,'' Frankfurt prosecutor's spokesman Gernot Broschat told The
Associated Press. ``I assume that they will go to prison.''
   Both men say they are in failing health and are likely to resist
any efforts to imprison them.
   The two served as deputy directors at the Brandenburg camp near
Berlin and in the Bernburg camp near the northwestern part of what
is now East Germany.
   Evidence at the trial showed the doctors' role included examining
incoming patients and fabricating causes of death to report to
victims' relatives. Others at the camps were primarily responsible
for the actual operation of the gas chambers.
   The Nazis claimed their Euthanasia Action was designed to help
hopelessly ill patients with no hope of recovery. More than 70,000
such patients were killed.
   Ulrike and Bunke, who both practiced gynecology after World War
II, went on trial in the 1960s following lengthy investigations.
They were acquitted when the court ruled they were forced by the
Nazis to take part in the mercy killings.
   The Federal Court of Justice overturned the ruling in 1970 and
ordered a retrial, which was delayed for years by the ill health of
both doctors.
   Ulrich practiced in the southern city of Stuttgart after World
War II, and Bunke worked in the northeastern town of Celle.

   The Jan. 1 inventory of cattle and calves on
the nation's farms and ranches edged down again to a 28-year low of
99,484,000 head from 99,524,000 a year ago, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   But the decline has slowed and there were indications many beef
producers have started rebuilding their herds. A year ago, the U.S.
cattle herd was down 2.4 percent from the 102 million head that had
been estimated Jan. 1, 1987. This year's decline was less than 1
percent.
   ``This slowed the recent downtrend in cattle inventories that
began six years ago and was the second consecutive inventory below
100 million head since 1961,'' the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board said.
   The estimate was in line with recent predictions of USDA
analysts, who say the shrinkage in the overall cattle herd may be
starting to rebound. As producers hold back breeding stock to
rebuild herds, beef output is expected to decline in the short run.
   Overall, according to USDA forecasts, 1989 beef production may
decline 5 percent to 7 percent from last year to the lowest level
since 1980.
   But large supplies of pork and poultry are expected and that
could leave this year's total meat output at only slightly below the
record level of 1988. Even so, retail beef prices are expected to
set records this year.
   As of Jan. 1, the number of beef cows and heifers that have
calved totaled 43.9 million head, up 1 percent from a year ago, the
first increase following six consecutive years of decline.
   Beef cows were reported at 33.7 milion head, up 2 percent from
Jan. 1, 1988, and dairy cows at 10.2 million head, down 1 percent.
It was the smallest inventory of U.S. milk cows since 1872, the
report said.
   The 1988 calf crop was estimated at almost 40.9 million head, up
2 percent from 1987.
   Analysts said the value of all cattle and calves as of Jan. 1 was
estimated at about $60.4 billion, up 16 percent from $52 billion a
year earlier. The average value was reported at $607 per head,
compared with $523 the previous year.
   Some other categories included:
   _All heifers 500 pounds and over, 17.3 million head, up 1 percent
from a year ago.
   _Beef replacement heifers, 5.51 million, up 5 percent.
   _Milk replacement heifers, 4.2 million, up 2 percent.
   _Other heifers, 7.63 million, down 2 percent.
   _Steers weighing 500 pounds and over, 15.8 million, up
fractionally.
   _Bulls weighing 500 pounds and over, 2.22 million, up 3 percent.
   _Calves under 500 pounds, 20.2 million, down 4 percent.
   _All cattle and calves being fed for slaughter, 11.2 million,
down 3 percent.

   A pathologist who sued a hospital he
said was more interested in profits than patients has been awarded
$19 million.
   Dr. Zbigniew Scheller was awarded the money Tuesday by a state
Circuit Court jury for hardships, including the loss of business
contacts, he has endured since the start of his 10-year legal battle.
   In the lawsuit, Scheller claimed officials at American Medical
International Inc. and Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center, a hospital
owned by AMI, sabotaged his business relationships with other
doctors because of his leading role in organizing medical staff
protests of AMI policies.
   In 1979, the hospital fired Scheller from his post as director of
the pathology lab.
   Scheller also claimed the hospital overbilled Medicare and
private insurance companies for pathology work on hundreds of
patients who entered the medical center from 1980 to 1986.
   AMI lead attorney Mercer Clarke was unavailable for comment
Wednesday. His secretary, who identified herself only as Teresa,
said Clark was on vacation and his co-counsel in the case, James
Polkinghorn, was not in the office.
   Jack Scarola, Scheller's attorney, said an appeal is expected.
   During the five-week trial, Clarke denied AMI cared less for
patients than profits, and said neither the corporation nor the
hospital ever targeted Scheller for harassment.
   Scheller had sought damages of $132 million _ which Scarola
estimated to be 10 percent of AMI's net worth.

<TEXT>
   Jamaicans will decide Thursday whether
to continue the conservative government of Prime Minister Edward
Seaga or, as the leading pollster predicts, return to Michael
Manley's leftist policies.
   The pollster, Carl Stone, says his surveys forecast a landslide
for Manley, a socialist who led a radical, pro-Cuba government
during the 1970s but has moderated his position. Seaga, a strong
U.S. ally, has been in office since 1980.
   Stone, who is associated with the University of the West Indies,
says the left-of-center People's National Party Manley leads will
win 48 of the 60 seats in Parliament.
   This will be the first contested national election since 1980,
when an estimated 700 people were killed in politically related
violence during a nine-month campaign.
   Manley boycotted the election Seaga called in 1983, in a dispute
over voter registration, leaving Seaga's center-right Jamaica Labor
Party with all 60 seats.
   At least 10 people have died in the current campaign, which is
taking place at the height of the Caribbean island's winter tourist
season and was shortened to just over three weeks.
   Violence has been confined to the Kingston slums and rural towns
far from the big tourist hotels on the north coast.
   Ash Wednesday was a holiday in Jamaica and there was no
campaigning.
   Manley ended his campaign Tuesday night with a plea for peace.
Two shooting deaths were reported earlier in the day.
   ``We cannot build a Jamaica that is worth anything unless we all
begin with a respect for life,'' he told thousands of supporters
gathered at a city square in the capital.
   Seaga's last campaign day was spent in a walking tour of his West
Kingston constituency, where thousands of people lined the streets
to cheer him on. In a radio broadcast that night, he announced plans
to create 200,000 jobs in five years in order to reduce the
unemployment rate from 21 percent to 15.
   He said the Manley government that preceded his had taken Jamaica
``to the brink of collapse'' with ill-conceived economic programs.
   Seaga, 58, was born in Boston and educated at Harvard. He has
presided over a business-oriented government and was the first
official foreign visitor to the Reagan White House in 1981. He was
an outspoken supporter of the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada.
   Manley, 64, attended the London School of Economics and was prime
minister in 1972-1980. He has projected a moderate, pro-U.S. image
in contrast to his former far-left position. Manley said this week
he had ``abandoned all thoughts of nationalization'' and wanted
private business to have a free hand.
   He said he would restore relations with Cuba during his first
year in office, but on a restricted and formal basis. Seaga broke
relations with Fidel Castro's government upon taking office in 1980.
   Jamaicans widely regard Seaga, who seeks an unprecedented third
consecutive term, as a skilled manager who is aloof and autocratic.
Manley, whose father Norman founded the People's National Party, is
a magnetic man seen as a champion of the people but a worry to
business leaders and Jamaica's foreign trading partners.
   Seaga has restored the economy through a rigid program that
emphasized tourism and exports, raised taxes and reduced social
services such as health and education.
   The standard of living of the island's 2.4 million people has
continued to decline, however, and Seaga's popularity has waned.

<TEXT>
   A financially troubled magazine of the
nation's leading opposition party on Wednesday got a chance to keep
espousing leftist causes when party leaders delayed a plan to close
it.
   Two weeks ago, leaders of the Social Democratic party said the
112-year-old publication, which outlasted bans by Bismarck and
Hitler, was losing too much money and would have to be shut down.
The decision prompted an angry outcry from inside and outside party
ranks.
   In the wake of that criticism, party leaders gathered Wednesday
and decided to delay the shutdown of the weekly magazine
``Vorwaerts,'' which means ``Forward.''
   The magazine's editor, Guenter Verheugen, said closing the
publication ``would silence an important voice in the history of
social democracy.''
   The publication's last issue was delivered Feb. 4, and employees
were ordered to abandon this week's edition.
   Under Wednesday's agreement, party leaders will allow
``Vorwaerts'' to continue publication until officials meet again
later this month to weigh the magazine's future.
   ``We'll work around the clock for the next two days if we have to
in order to get the issue out on time,'' said Gode Japs, the
magazine's executive editor.
   Earlier in the day, nervous employees huddled in small groups in
the magazine's cluttered editorial officies in Bad Godesberg to
await the decision.
   ``There hasn't been much to do here,'' said Japs. ``We've been
answering mail, organizing our files and discussing what to do
next.''
   Japs said 47 people could lose their jobs if the magazine folds.
   But he said employees were determined to fight to keep the
publication going. He said morale also was boosted by a ``flood of
letters from readers expressing support and several hundred
spontaneous new subscriptions.''
   Party officials announcing the decision to shut down the magazine
said they saw little hope of boosting the circulation of 46,000 by
50 percent. They said the new subscriptions are needed to cover
rising costs and operating shortfalls.
   Founded in 1876 by Wilhelm Hasenclever and Wilhelm Liebknecht,
the magazine was forced into a 12-year hiatus when Chancellor Otto
von Bismarck banned the Social Democrats in 1878.
   ``Vorwaerts,'' which took a strident anti-Nazi line, was banned
by Adolf Hitler after he came to power in 1933. Its staff went into
exile but continued to publish in Prague and then Paris until German
troops invaded France in 1940.
   The magazine reappeared in 1948 as the official organ of the
Social Democratic Party in West Germany. In its latest edition, it
covered a broad range of topics, including the election of
extreme-right candidates to the West Berlin Parliament and
developments in the Soviet Union, Israel, Italy and Yugoslavia.
   Party officials say the glossy magazine could revert to a
newspaper format in an effort to cut costs. Estimates of its
operating deficit from party and magazine sources vary, ranging from
$2.6 million to $295,000.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Seven Detainees Hospitalized from Effects of Hunger Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven black detainees who
started a hunger strike 16 days ago were hospitalized Wednesday with
ailments brought on by their refusal to eat, a human rights lawyer
said.
   Another 105 blacks joined the hunger strike, raising to about 300
the number of detainees threatening to starve themselves unless they
are freed or charged, a civil rights group said.
   The hunger strike represents one of the most dramatic challenges
to the policy of detention without trial since the national state of
emergency was declared in June 1986 to quell racial unrest.
   Seven men who helped initiate the hunger strike at Johannesburg's
Diepkloof Prison on Jan. 23 were transferred to Johannesburg
Hospital, said attorney Azhar Cachalia.
   Cachalia, who represents one of the seven, told a news conference
he did not know the condition of the men.
   The hospital superintendent could not be contacted, and other
personnel refused to answer questions about the men.
   The minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok, released a statement
saying ``the state cannot allow itself to be blackmailed by way of
hunger strikes.''
   ``The hunger strikers must realize that the government has a duty
toward society and they will be detained as long as it is in the
interests of public safety,'' the statement said.
   The Black Sash, a nationwide civil rights organization, said 105
detainees at St. Albans Prison in Port Elizabeth, including many
held since 1986, joined the strike Monday.
   ``Notwithstanding 32 months of continuous detention without
trial, no case has been brought against us,'' the strikers said in a
statement Wednesday. ``We are left with no alternative but to take
our lives into our own hands ... and to demand our immediate release
from this dehumanizing detention.''
   The statement said the detainees would consume no food or liquids
until their demands were met.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the state of emergency. An estimated 1,000 to
1,500 people remain in detention.
   A legal aid group, Lawyers for Human Rights, called on Vlok to
amend detention regulations to limit detention without trial to
three months and to allow detainees to be visited by lawyers and
relatives.
   The hunger strike was started by 20 detainees at Diepkloof
Prison. About 170 more detainees at Diepkloof subsequently joined
the strike.
   According to the Black Sash, the detainees at St. Albans Prison
include more than 50 anti-apartheid leaders in their third year of
detention, including prominent activists who helped organize a
successful black consumer boycott in 1985.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice
in national affairs, while the 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate schools, districts and health services.

<HEAD>Communist Official Calls for Polish Version of Katyn Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislator wrote in a state newspaper
Wednesday that Poland should publish its version of the World War II
massacre of Polish officers in the Katyn forest, and not wait for
the conclusions of Soviet historians.
   Ryszard Wojna, the Communist Party caucus leader in the Sejm, or
parliament, said Soviet historians have had Poland's secret report
and unpublished documents on the massacre for more than a year and
have not responded.
   A joint Polish-Soviet historical commission has been reassessing
the massacre since April 1987 as part of efforts to remove ``blank
spots'' in the history of the two nations.
   Officially, Poland and the Soviet Union blame the massacre of the
4,300 Polish officers on the Nazis. But historians in the West and
most Poles believe the officers taken into Soviet custody soon after
the outbreak of the war were killed by Soviet security police on
Josef Stalin's orders.
   The victims found at Katyn were among 15,000 Polish military
prisoners who disappeared after being interned by the Soviets. Among
them were 8,300 officers _ half the Polish army's prewar officer
corps.
   The fate of Polish officers and enlisted men held at two other
camps has never been revealed.
   Soviets say the officers at Katyn fell into the hands of
advancing Nazi troops while on a road-building mission near
Smolensk, and were killed by the Gestapo, the Nazi security police.
   Public revelation of the killings by the Nazis in 1943, and a
Polish request for an international investigation, created tensions
and led the Soviet government to break relations with the Polish
government-in-exile in London.
   Shortly afterward, Stalin set up his own Polish committee in
Moscow that became the seed of Poland's postwar communist government.
   Publication of Wojna's article in the government daily Republic
indicated his proposal already has official approval.
   ``By publishing the expertise of Polish scientists, we shall
weaken the painful burdens on Polish-Soviet relations,'' said
Wojna's article.
   ``The information on the stance taken by Polish scientists ...
cannot be reserved any longer only for the Soviet members. The
entire Soviet society has the right to know this stance and the
newly revealed documents.''
   He said the Soviets ``should know that such painful matters
cannot be kept under the cover of scientific discretion for they may
make the cover explode.''

<HEAD>Commonwealth Calls for Tougher Sanctions against South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of eight Commonwealth
nations Wednesday called for tougher sanctions against South Africa,
saying financial embargos are among the most powerful weapons to use
against apartheid.
   Among countries criticized for not giving more muscle to
financial sanctions was Canada, whose External Affairs Minister Joe
Clark chaired the meeting of the Commonwealth Committee on South
Africa.
   During the three-day meeting, which ended Wednesday, Clark told
fellow ministers he found trade figures reflecting a 44 percent
increase in Canadian exports to South Africa and 67 percent increase
in imports from South Africa in 1988 ``very embarrassing.''
   The foreign ministers, tasked by the 48-nation Commonwealth of
former British colonies to explore ways to toughen economic
sanctions against South Africa, reviewed the terms of existing bans
to plug loopholes, Clark told reporters.
   He said he was not embarrassed by criticism at the meeting
because his government approved a $504 million loan by the Canadian
Bank of Nova Scotia to a Luxembourg-based company owned 71 percent
by South Africa's Oppenheimer family. Oppenheimers own the De Beers
diamond monopoly and a major stockholding in the South African
mining and ranching conglomerate, Anglo American Corp.
   Media reports said the Canadian loan was needed for Minorco's
$4.4 billion takeover bid for London-based Consolidated Goldfields,
which has substantial mining interests in South Africa.
   Clark said the loan to the Luxembourg company Minorco did not
breach Canada's prohibition on investment in South Africa as it was
not made to a South African-based company.
   ``That action is in bounds,'' he said. ``In question now is the
adequacy of the ban we have in place. We have to see if it reflects
the intent of the Commonwealth.''
   The meeting ending with several resolutions, including a call for
world financial institutions to deny loan and debt rescheduling
facilities to South Africa.
   In a final statement, the ministers identified financial
sanctions in world money markets as ``one of the most powerful
sources of pressure'' to force Pretoria to abandon its legal system
of racial separation, called apartheid.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia has readmitted former Ugandan
dictator Idi Amin to exile after he slipped back into East Africa
for three weeks, Arab diplomats in the kingdom said Wednesday.
   But one diplomat said Amin ``will doubtless lose his last
refuge'' if he continues political activities and statements.
   The diplomats, reached in Jiddah by telephone, said Amin returned
to the Red Sea port city about a week ago.
   The burly, 61-year-old Amin fled to Libya after he was ousted in
April 1979 by his main political rival, Milton Obote. When Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi rejected him eight months later, he was
granted political asylum by Saudi Arabia.
   In later months, Amin was joined by one of his two wives and his
22 children.
   ``Idi Amin has been accepted again in the kingdom as a political
refugee, on the explicit condition that he keep his mouth shut and
cease meddling in politics,'' one Jiddah-based diplomat told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. ``He also promised not
to leave here surreptitiously again.''
   Amin left his home in suburban Jiddah with one of his sons on
false passports and surfaced on Jan. 3 in Zaire, where the
government quickly expelled him.
   At first, he shuttled between Zaire and Senegal when it became
clear he had also become persona non grata in Saudi Arabia. Amin had
displeased his Saudi hosts with impromptu political statements and
telephone interviews about African politics, primarily his frequent
declarations that he would return to Kampala and recapture power in
his East African country.
   The diplomats said Saudi authorities have posted guards at Amin's
home.

   ``I feel that I have been treated like Jack the Ripper,'' Mrs.
Rogers said Wednesday.
   Bernard and Sonja Arbuse, who live directly below Mrs. Rogers at
the Sun and Surf condominium, claimed in court the problem began
five years ago _ when Mrs. Rogers had Italian tile laid in her
$235,000 condo at the seaside complex.
   The judge refused a request by the couple's attorney, Charles
Nugent, that Mrs. Rogers be ordered to install carpeting.
   ``I don't believe Mrs. Rogers is required to give up her right to
decorate,'' said Burk. ``And I don't believe I can require her to
stop walking.''
   Mrs. Rogers, who said she has not worn high heels in her
apartment for 3{ years, praised the judge for allowing her to keep
the Italian tiles.
   ``But I'm at the mercy of my neighbors,'' she complained. ``If
they think they hear something, then I can be held in contempt of
court.''

<HEAD>Oil Slick Skimmed From Antarctic Waters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. clean-up team has begun to skim up
fuel oil that has threatened wildlife since it leaked into Antarctic
waters from a grounded Argentine supply ship late last month,
officials said Wednesday.
   Chilean divers also worked to patch the vessel's leaky hull, the
officials said.
   A 35-foot skimming boat rushed down from the United States began
cleaning up Tuesday, according to officials of the Chilean navy and
the National Science Foundation in Washington.
   A navy communique issued in Santiago said the boat skimmed the
waters near a U.S. research base, Palmer Station. ``There is a
notable reduction of contaminant in the water,'' it said.
   Authorities also planned to use the special craft inside a ring
of floating booms set up Tuesday by the Chilean navy to contain oil
around the leaking, nearly-sunken Bahia Paraiso, the Argentine
research and supply ship.
   The Bahia Paraiso, carrying more than 800 tons of fuel oil, ran
aground Jan. 28 on shoals about two miles from Palmer Station and
about 590 miles from the tip of South America.
   The oil has been slowly leaking, creating a slick two miles long
and threatening the frozen continent's pristine enviroment and
exotic wildlife. An estimated 29,000 thousands penguins nest in the
area.
   But Jack Renerie, a spokesman for the National Science
Foundation, said experts at Palmer Station have little precise
information on the impact so far.
   ``We've seen about six dead penguins so far, and oil on an awful
lot more of them,'' he said. ``But what the real extent will be we
don't know yet.''
   The United States, Chile and Argentina dispatched costly clean-up
missions to the site.
   Chilean navy divers ``inspected the hull of the sunken ship and
began patching efforts,'' the communique said. It said it was
believed that all leaks had been sealed.
   A U.S. vessel, the Polar Duke, arrived early Tuesday with 17
military and civilian clean-up experts and 52 tons of equipment,
including the skimming boat. The specialists and equipment were
flown down in a U.S. air force cargo plane to the southern Chilean
port of Punta Arenas, where they were put in the boat.

   A pathologist who sued a hospital he
said was more interested in profits than patients has been awarded
$19 million.
   Dr. Zbigniew Scheller was awarded the money Tuesday by a state
Circuit Court jury for hardships, including the loss of business
contacts, he has endured since the start of his 10-year legal battle.
   In the lawsuit, Scheller claimed officials at American Medical
International Inc. and Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center, a hospital
owned by AMI, sabotaged his business relationships with other
doctors because of his leading role in organizing medical staff
protests of AMI policies.
   In 1979, the hospital fired Scheller from his post as director of
the pathology lab.
   Scheller also claimed the hospital overbilled Medicare and
private insurance companies for pathology work on hundreds of
patients who entered the medical center from 1980 to 1986.
   AMI lead attorney Mercer Clarke was unavailable for comment
Wednesday. His secretary, who identified herself only as Teresa,
said Clark was on vacation and his co-counsel in the case, James
Polkinghorn, was not in the office.
   Jack Scarola, Scheller's attorney, said an appeal is expected.
   During the five-week trial, Clarke denied AMI cared less for
patients than profits, and said neither the corporation nor the
hospital ever targeted Scheller for harassment.
   Scheller had sought damages of $132 million _ which Scarola
estimated to be 10 percent of AMI's net worth.

   A prosecutor filed murder charges
against a soldier accused of killing seven people and wounding nine
when he ran amok with a rifle after a quarrel with his girlfriend.
   Prosecutor Adolfo Alcoseba charged Constable Jesus Negro on
Tuesday with murder and attempted murder in a provincial court in
Cebu city 350 miles southeast of Manila, the government-run
Philippine News Agency said.
   The military said Negro, a member of the elite Special Action
Force, went on a shooting spree Nov. 30 after he left his
girlfriend's home in Tiber village in Cebu.
   Five people were killed and five injured in the first volley when
Negro fired his semi-automatic rifle at neighbors. He then hitched a
ride to a nearby town and opened fire while en route, killing two
more and wounding four.
   Negro was dismissed from the service five days after he
surrendered to authorities. No date for the arraignment was given.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, warning
of ``massive human suffering'' in Sudan, issued an urgent appeal
Wednesday for a cease-fire in that nation's civil war so emergency
food supplies can be rushed to victims of the fighting.
   ``The death toll from starvation in 1988 alone is estimated in
the hundreds of thousands,'' Baker said in a statement.
   Baker asked both the Sudanese government and the rebels based in
southern Sudan ``to put peace first'' and allow relief to flow to
the needy.
   ``The U.S. government is profoundly concerned about massive human
suffering in Sudan,'' he said. ``Most of the war's victims are
civilians who are displaced and impoverished or who starve to death
for lack of delivery of available food.''
   Up until late last year, both sides in the civil war refused to
allow emergency food deliveries to refugees in contested areas,
hoping to gain an advantage.
   The department has estimated that large-scale starvation has
claimed between 100,000 to 250,000 people in the past year alone.
   The six-year war has also resulted in massive dislocations. U.S.
officials believe that up to 2 million people have been displaced,
including 360,000 forced to flee into neighboring Ethiopia.
   In its annual human rights report issued this week, the
department charged Sudan with ``the largest number of victims in
1988'' and ``serious human rights violations'' stemming from the war
and the interference with international aid organizations.
   Baker warned that failure to act before the rainy season sets in
``will mean that thousands more will die.''
   Asking for immediate international cooperation, Baker pledged
that the United States ``will do all it can to support this (relief)
effort.''
   ``The sad reality, however, is that starvation will almost
certainly not end until the fighting ends. As friends of Sudan, we
urge the Sudanese government and the Sudanese People's Liberation
Army to put peace first and agree to an early ceasefire which would
... allow relief to reach those in need,'' Baker wrote.
   ``A cease-fire, which is necessary for getting relief to all
those in need, is most urgent,'' the statement said.

   The government has reached agreement

officials said Wednesday.
   The state-run Korea Trade Promotion Corp. said after South Korea
opens its own trade offices in March, it would organize trade
missions to visit Warsaw, Sofia, and Moscow to sell products.
   The Soviet Union and South Korea announced last month they would
open trade offices in each other's countries, also in March. Hungary

   Hungary is the only communist nation which has established
diplomatic relations with South Korea. Seoul is trying to improve
ties with communist nations to expand its trade base and smooth its

<HEAD>Bush Says No Plans to Send Troops to Fight Drugs _ for Now</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush and a Pentagon official on
Wednesday denied any plans to send U.S. troops to destroy South
American drug laboratories, but Bush said he wouldn't rule it out in
the future.
   Asked about an NBC News report that such an effort was being
prepared, Bush said, ``Nobody's discussed that with me,'' and added
that he is ``very wary of committing U.S. troops overseas.''
   He said he would never take such action ``until I've given it a
lot of thought.''
   Bush added, ``There could be times, working cooperatively with
leaders in the hemisphere, that American assistance would be sought
and American assistance would be granted in wiping out insidious
factories that send poison in to poison our kids ... so you don't
rule something out.''
   NBC reported Tuesday that the administration was preparing a
major drug interdiction plan that would put ``several hundred''
Special Operations commandos into several South American nations.
   ``There isn't any such plan,'' said Maj. David Super, a Defense
Department spokesman. ``We've spent all day batting down the
report.''
   Super said he didn't know if that might be one of the options
being tossed around as part of possibly greater involvement by the
military in the drug war.
   One official involved in the anti-drug effort said various
options will be considered but that reports on such options could
hurt the effort by giving information to drug operators.
   The official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, also said
discussing potential cooperative arrangements with foreign
governments could be harmful.
   ``The one thing that will make these host governments very
nervous and less likely to cooperate is if they think something by
American forces is going to be done to them without their
knowledge,'' the official said.
   Bush made his comments during an Oval Office photo session with
William Bennett, whom he has nominated to become director of
National Drug Control Policy.
   Bennett said Tuesday that ``there's a lot of discussion going
on'' about increased involvement by the military. In the past,
Bennett has called for such involvement.

<HEAD>Farmers Borrowing More</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers have once again started to borrow money
on a large scale, a sign the nation's long-awaited agricultural
recovery is in full swing, an Agriculture Department report said
Wednesday.
   ``The large paydown in farm debt held by major farm lenders
appears to be over, and debt is expected to grow 1.5 percent to 3.5
percent in 1989,'' the department's Economic Research Service said.
``Farm loan demand strengthened in the past year and should continue
to expand in 1989.''
   At the height of the recent financial crunch, as plummeting land
values cut sharply into assets, thousands of farmers owed so much
they couldn't qualify for more credit to pay bills.
   With the lid on further credit, farmers often liquidated or
culled livestock herds, sold commodities held in storage and took
other steps to reduce debts. As this paydown took effect, banks and
other lending institutions have eased back.
   As a result, the report said ``credit-worthy farmers should have
ample access to operating credit'' for spring planting and other
production expenses this year.
   ``Farm lenders are optimistic about financial conditions despite
the (1988) drought and do not think it will sidetrack the farm
recovery,'' the report said.
   Major farm lending groups reported stronger portfolios in 1988
and fewer farm loan delinquencies, loan charge-offs and
foreclosures, it said. An exception was the department's Farmers
Home Administration, which makes loans to the least creditworthy
producers, but ``indications are that it too is coming to grips''
with its problems, the report said.
   A major reason for the favorable farm financial outlook this year
was said to be the continued strength in crop and livestock
commodity sales.
   ``Better economic fundamentals also underlie long-run trends in
agriculture,'' the report said. ``Farmland markets have improved and
the farm sector balance sheet (of assets and liabilities) has
stabilized.''
   Analysts said commodity surpluses are being reduced by last
year's drought-shriveled crop production and strong demand.
   ``The cost-price pressures of the early and mid-1980s have been
alleviated,'' the report added. ``But the farm sector will continue
to depend heavily on government payments, and some farms will be
financially threatened because of the drought.''

<HEAD>University Revises Smoking Policy Under Pressure From State Lawmakers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Louisville scaled back a
smoking policy to satisfy lawmakers in this tobacco-growing state
who threatened to cut the school's budget.
   Details of the regulations, revised before they were adopted,
were released Wednesday.
   ``I believe they are fair and equitable to our faculty, staff and
students,'' said university President Donald Swain. ``We want to
create an impression of evenhandedness, fairness and balance.''
   When the first draft was released last fall, it was attacked by
state Rep. Donald Gedling, chairman of the General Asembly's Tobacco
Task Force.
   Commenting on the revised version, Gedlin said, ``I could live
with that without any problem. If it's fair to smokers, that's what
we want to look at.''
   But House Agriculture Committee Chairman Clay Crupper said he
wasn't pleased the university had adopted any regulations Tuesday.
   ``I didn't think they needed any policy. They could do it without
any regulations,'' he said.
   Tobacco is a $2 billion industry in Kentucky, the nation's
leading tobacco grower. Kentucky had the nation's highest
smoking-related death rate in 1985, the Centers for Disease Control
reported in November.
   The American Lung Association of Kentucky declined to comment
Wednesday on the revised policy, but the group's health education
director in November said he was embarrassed by legislators'
intervention.
   ``Tobacco is such an ingrained part of the social, economic and
political structure of this entire state, it's hard for people from
non-tobacco states to understand,'' said Mike Staufacker.
   Swain said the three-page guideline omits a controversial section
under which impasses between smokers and non-smokers would have been
resolved in favor of non-smokers. The policy now directs department
heads to discuss and settle conflicts with employees and their
supervisors.
   Another change involves open areas in which many people work.
   The first draft prohibited smoking in such areas. The final
regulation directs that such areas should be separated into smoking
and no-smoking areas, if practical. Otherwise, the area is to be
designated smoking or no-smoking by the department head after
consulting with employees.
   As before, the regulation prohibits smoking in most common areas
where people congregate, such as halls, reception areas and
auditoriums, and in classrooms and laboratories and areas where it
would be a fire hazard.
   It permits smoking in private offices, rooms and apartments in
residence halls and university vehicles, unless a non-smoker in the
vehicle objects; and it directs that smoking and no-smoking areas be
designated in cafeterias.
   Spokesmen for faculty, staff and students generally said they
were satisfied with the changes, which take effect March 1.
   The revision took place largely behind closed doors, and Swain
defended that procedure.
   ``We made a conscious effort to keep this from being a news
item,'' he said. ``The advice I got from all sides was to let the
dust settle, let the emotions subside, get the issue out of the
newspapers and off the television sets. Then, after the issue calmed
down, we'd have an atmosphere better for decision-making.''

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, battered
by political and personal crises since his failed presidential
campaign, met with soon-to-be Democratic Party chief Ronald Brown
but quickly brushed aside questions about his political future.
   ``Right now, I want to do everything I can to do the best job I
can to be governor of Massachusetts on a full-time basis,'' Dukakis
said when asked about a possible presidential run in 1992. ``We've
got a lot to do.''
   Questions about Dukakis' political future followed a private
meeting he had with Brown, who is expected to be selected party
chairman Friday by the Democratic National Committee.
   ``Once you're the party's nominee, (maintaining a national
political presence is) something that's expected of you,'' Dukakis
said. ``But I also know that my first and most important challenge''
is the fiscal problems in Massachusetts.
   Brown, a former aide to the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., has faced the same problem that hounded Dukakis
throughout the presidential campaign _ criticism he is too liberal.
Dukakis defended Brown, saying he would ``make a fine'' party
chairman.
   The governor faces severe state budget problems at home and this
week revealed that his wife, Kitty, was admitted for alcohol abuse
at a Newport, R.I., clinic following a letdown from the presidential
loss.
   Asked about the toll an unsuccessful presidential campaign takes
on a family, a subdued Dukakis said: ``It's about as tough as
anybody in life has to go through.''
   Massachusetts colleagues indicated that the political and family
problems are taking their toll on Dukakis.
   ``Obviously he has his mind in Newport, Rhode Island,'' said Sen.
John F. Kerry, D-Mass., after the state's congressional delegation
had lunch with Dukakis in the office of Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass.
   ``Personally and politically, these are very tough times. He's
handling them as best he can,'' said Rep. Chester G. Atkins,
D-Mass., chairman of the state party. ``Right now he has his eye on
the job in front of him, and it's an enormous task,'' Atkins said,
referring to the state's budget woes.
   After meeting with Brown, Dukakis spent the day on Capitol Hill.
He scheduled meetings with his former running mate, Senate Finance
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., and Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance, to discuss corporate takeovers.
   Dukakis, who pointed to hostile takeover bids aimed at Polaroid
Corp. and Prime Computer Inc. in Massachusetts, offered no
recommendations, but said a state commission studying takeovers is
expected to deliver its final report soon.
   Dukakis also met with Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., to discuss
federal housing programs. The governor said he was encouraged by
signals from the Bush administration and Jack Kemp, secretary of
housing and urban development. Housing was a cornerstone of the
Democrat's presidential campaign.

<HEAD>Safety Agencies Divided Over Safest Way to Buckle Child in Car</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board on
Wednesday urged another regulatory agency to change its
recommendation on the safest way to buckle children in a car.
   The board's criticism came in comments on a proposal by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to require rear-seat
lap-and-shoulder belts in passenger vehicles.
   At issue was whether looping the shoulder restraint on a
lap-and-shoulder belt over a child leaves the child vulnerable to
neck injuries in the event of an accident.
   The highway administration, in proposing the regulation, said
that when a child is buckled in, the shoulder portion of the belt
``should be routed behind the child, and the child should be
protected only by the lap belt.''
   The safety board, however, said it strongly disagreed.
   ``We know of no evidence that children are endangered by using a
lap-shoulder belt, whether it crosses the neck or not,'' NTSB said.
``Indeed, we have cited to the NHTSA several studies demonstrating
that these systems provide good protection to children.''
   The use of lap-belts alone places children in danger of serious
and possibly fatal injury to the abdomen, spine and head, the safety
board said.
   Its response otherwise endorsed the heart of the highway
administration's proposal, which was generally in line with a 1986
safety board recommendation to manufacturers.
   The highway agency rule would require the lap-and-shoulder
combination in the two rear window positions in passenger cars
except convertibles manufactured beginning Sept. 1 and in
convertibles, light trucks, multipurpose vehicles and light buses
made from Sept. 1, 1991.
   Regulations presently require lap-and-shoulder belts in the two
front-seat positions but require only lap-belts in rear seats.
   The National Transportation Safety Board also urged the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration to consider requiring
lap-and-shoulder belts in the center rear-seat position but
recommended against delaying the overall regulation to meet
technical difficulties with that requirement.
   The highway admininstration, in its proposed regulation, said the
center lap-and-shoulder belt would provide ``small safety benefits''
at substantially greater cost.
   The safety board also urged its fellow agency to require
crash-testing of the rear-seat belts, particularly because the
highway administration regulation would allow belt designs that
critics assert allow excessive slack.

   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., introduced legislation

   His proposed groupings would be the Northeast plus Puerto Rico,
the Great Lakes states, the Midwest, the Southeast and the Virgin

   There would be primaries for each party beginning on the second
Tuesday in March of a presidential election year and continuing, one
each month, through July. The Federal Election Commission would
determine the order by drawing lots 70 days before the first round.
   ``It would no longer be in a candidate's best interest to tailor
his or her message to a small group of voters,'' Dixon said. ``In
addition, since the first primary would be chosen at random, each
region would get a fair chance to be in the spotlight'' on the early

   Godwin had been using the alias of Stewart Carrera, but his
identity was confirmed by his fingerprints, Voss said. Godwin was
being held in Guadalajara and U.S. authorities are expected to seek
his extradition.
   Godwin was serving a sentence of 26-years-to-life in prison for
first-degree murder when he escaped June 5, 1987, with the help of
his wife and a former prisoner, Folsom officials said.
   He cut security bars on a storm drain, then used an inflatable
rubber raft to cross the American River, which flows past Folsom.
   Godwin was convicted of the 1980 murder of a Riverside County
man. According to testimony at his trial, Godwin stabbed the man 26
times in an attempt to steal drugs from him.
   His escape was the third in nearly two decades at Folsom, prison
authorities said.

<HEAD>Senate Praises Former Ambassador, Majority Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate welcomed Mike Mansfield, the
recently retired U.S. ambassador to Japan, on Wednesday, hailing its
former majority leader as ``the ideal public servant'' and
expressing gratitude for his more than 70 years of service as
soldier, teacher, member of Congress and diplomat.
   As Mansfield, who will be 86 next month, sat in the Senate
gallery, senator after senator praised his accomplishments and long
career.
   The Senate than unanimously adopted a resolution saluting
Mansfield for displaying ``the highest qualities of dedication,
integrity and rectitude,'' for his service in Japan and for his
advice to every president from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald
Reagan.
   ``I believe Mike Mansfield represents the best that American
democracy has to offer,'' said Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, the
Senate's majority leader. ``He is simple, direct, forthright and
honest.''
   Mansfield was first elected to Congress from Montana in 1943. He
served in the House until winning election to the Senate in 1952. He
served as majority leader there from 1961 to 1977, the longest
tenure in Senate history.
   President Carter appointed Mansfield ambassador to Japan; he was
reappointed by President Reagan. In all he served as the U.S. envoy
to Japan for 11 years, longer than anyone else who has held the post.

   The government and electric utilities have
quietly implemented an anti-terrorist program, even though weather
is considered a greater threat to U.S. energy supplies than any
terrorist group, an industry official told Congress on Wednesday.
   Michehl R. Gent, president of the North American Electric
Reliability Council, said the program was implemented about six
months ago. But he said ``skepticism was rampant'' among planners
that a multi-site terrorist attack ever would be carried out against
U.S. electric facilities.
   Gent told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee the program
involves an ``ongoing working relationship'' between the FBI and the
council, which he said represents virtually all U.S. and Canadian
electric suppliers.
   He said that because of fear of tipping off terroristsabout the
plan, it was conceived as a ``quiet'' program.
   ``Quiet means that we have struck a deal with the Department of
Energy and the National Security Council: They don't talk about this
program in public, and we don't talk about this program in public,''
Gent said.
   ``My testimony today is the first, and I hope the last, public
utterance of our program,'' Gent said, adding he would be willing to
discuss specifics of the program in a closed committee session.
   Committee Chairman John Glenn, D-Ohio, said that could be done.
He noted that oil and natural gas pipeline representatives had cited
concerns over publicity in declining to testify before the committee.
   Gent said that despite the concerns about terrorism, the U.S.
electric system is resilient and redundant and natural events such
as hurricanes could cause more damage than terrorists. ``And we've
shown we can handle hurricanes.''
   Another witness said there had been 283 documented cases of
sabotage against American energy systems since 1980.
   But Robert K. Mullen, a terrorism expert, said he saw no evidence
of an increasing terrorist threat in the United States and that most
previous acts of sabotage had been incidents such as shooting at
power lines or arson against gasoline station owners or operators.
   ``There are no indicators of which I am aware ... that would
suggest to me the threat to energy assets here is substantially
different from what the recent historical record indicates,'' Mullen
said.
   But Gent acknowledged that ``our concern is not the events that
we're experiencing now but the potential capability that's been
demonstrated to us by the Department of Energy.''
   In earlier testimony, the committee was told that the increasing
high-tech nature of the U.S. telecommunications systems and a trend
towards centralization of facilities was making the networks more
vulnerable to ``catastrophic'' terrorist attack.
   The Energy Department has been advising U.S. companies privately
of a growing threat of ``techno-terrorism'' attack on vital domestic
energy facilities and it is pressing them to fortify their defenses,
The Associated Press reported this week.

   Jeffrey ``Scott' Campbell, 15, won first prize
in a Nintendo contest Wednesday with a plot for a video game far too
complex for anyone over 16 to follow.
   It involves ``the vast kingdom of Candillia, a peaceful and
futuristic world,'' that has been ``ruled by the LockArm Dynasty for
ages'' and whose secrets are locked in a ``Sword of Power.'' It
involves a queen who bore Siamese twins who were given robotic arms.
   It involves the gate to Fifth Dimension, alien invaders who fall
from the skies in a cosmic exchange of civilizations, a rocky
terrain crawling with mutants and Okra, a six-armed king.
   The judges declared that Scott's design for a new game, carefully
mounted in a notebook and illustrated with hand-lettered text and
drawings, was the most ultimate among the 10,134 entries submitted
by youngsters aged 8 to 15 _ 80 percent of them boys.
   ``I had lots of ideas and I like to draw,'' said Scott, after
winning. He is from Aurora, Colo.
   Second place went to Michael Krier, 13, of South Bend, Ind., in
whose design for ``Anatomic Commando'' white blood cells are the
heroes and viruses the villains. In his game, gamma globulin
missiles fight off Attack Bacteria, Monster Bacteria and Virus
Clusters.
   Phil Loring, 13, of Londonderry, N.H., won third prize with an
idea for a new kind of peripheral equipment to accompany the
computer game. It would simulate a climate and an environment
appropriate to whatever game is being played _ offering, perhaps,
the suggestion of swirling dark clouds when things go wrong in Scott
Campbell's LockArm Dynasty.
   The prizes were $3,000, $2,000 and $1,000 savings bonds. Nintendo
said it had no plans to put the prize-winning games into production.
   The finalist entry which really caught Washington's political eye
didn't win. It was ``Voyage to the White House,'' submitted by Kate
Bellamy, 12, of Toccoa, Ga.
   In Kate's game, ``George Bush has been elected president and now
must journey to the White House to take his place as president. On
the way, he must fight Democrats by jumping on them and collecting
cash. At the end of Level 5, Bush and (Dan) Quayle will fight
Michael Dukakis and if he wins goes to the White House where the Tax
Deficit is lowered and everything is fine.''
   In addition to Kate, the other finalists were: Scott Clark and
Jeff Kiesel, both 15, a team from Crestwood, Ky.; Justin Balthrop,
10, of Albuquerque, N.M.; Norm Becht, 15, of Bellingham, Wash.;
Damon Fontenot, 13, of Borger, Texas; Alex Jizrawi, 13, of San
Carolos, Calif., and Chris Maycock, 10, of Malvern, Pa.

<HEAD>Anderson's Sister Visits Syria, Told No Hostage Developments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syrian officials met on Wednesday with the
sister of American journalist Terry A. Anderson, the hostage held
longest in Lebanon, and told her they had no indication any captives
would be freed soon.
   Peggy Say and three other American women arrived Tuesday night
for what she called a one-week personal visit not linked to any
current effort to free Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent
of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985 in Beirut.
   Speculation has arisen again in Beirut that some of the 15
foreigners held hostage, nine of whom are Americans, soon would be
freed. Most are believed held by fundamentalist Shiite Moslems loyal
to Iran.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Say met with Zouheir Jannan, director of the
Information Ministry, who told her President Hafez Assad's
government considers the hostage issue ``a cause for Syria.''
   He also informed her the situation was sensitive, ``and we have
nothing to tell you,'' according to officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Meetings with other senior officials, including Information
Minister Mohammed Salman, are expected before Mrs. Say's scheduled
departure departure Feb. 16.
   ``My visit coincides with my birthday Feb.15 and also with the
third anniversary of my father's death,'' said Mrs. Say, who last
visited Syria in 1986.
   Glenn Anderson died of cancer Feb. 15, 1986. Anderson's brother
Glenn also died of cancer on June 7 that year. As far as is known,
Anderson is not aware of the deaths.
   Mrs. Say said she recently received a ``very nice, comforting
message'' from Sheik Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be an umbrella
group for Shiites holding hostages.
   ``I'd like to thank him personally if I could,'' she said, but
did not reveal the message.
   Fadlallah now is in Tehran. Syrian officials said they would
arrange a meeting if Fadlallah came to Damascus on his way back to
Lebanon.
   Without elaborating, Mrs. Say said she received a similar message
from Assad and ``I wish to thank President Assad for all his
efforts.''
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has been instrumental in
freeing several Western hostages and has promised to help secure the
release of the others.
   ``I'm not here to meet anybody in particular, but I'm open to see
those who want to talk to me,'' said Mrs. Say.
   She said she may go to Beirut, noting that she has a Lebanese
visa and a special State Department exemption from a U.S. ban on
Americans visiting Lebanon.

<HEAD>Rhode Island Sniper Trial Goes To Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of a man accused in a string of
sniper assaults went to the jury Wednesday after the defense
attorney told jurors his client said he was the sniper only to get
attention.
   Peter T. Trepanier was a ``jokester, a prankster,'' and
prosecutors failed to link him to any of the shootings, break-ins
and arsons, John J. Hardiman argued.
   Trepanier faces six counts of assault with intent to commit
murder and six counts of conspiracy to commit murder in the string
of sniping attacks in Cumberland and North Smithfield in December
1986 and January 1987. He also is charged with a series of
burglaries and housefires in Burrillville and Glocester from April
to June 1987. Trepanier, 25, faces a possible life sentence if
convicted on the arson charges.
   Prosecuting attorney Eva Marie Mancuso told the 16 jurors that
the prankster argument was an insult to their intelligence.
   ``The defense wants you to think this was an attention-getting
statement,'' said Mancuso. But, she told the jury, Trepanier had
told both his friend, Paula Laliberte, and police that the gun used
in the attacks was in a local pond and a gun was actually found
there.
   ``Who picked up the rifle each and every time and looked in the
scope and pulled the trigger and watched the people fall?'' Mancuso
asked the jury.
   Trepanier was reckless, and ``reckless is intent to murder,'' she
said.
   The jurors retired to a downtown hotel Wednesday afternoon after
asking to see the exhibits in the case and to have the definition of
the crime assault with intent to commit murder read back to them.
   Hardiman spent much time rebutting the statements of Laliberte,
who gave detailed testimony about how the defendant confessed to the
shootings on Oct. 7, 1987, before they both went to Woonsocket
police.
   ``They really are attention-getters,'' Hardiman said of the
statements. He said Laliberte had described Trepanier as ``a
jokester, a prankster, a kind of guy who would kid around.''
   Hardiman said police had not been able to test the .22-caliber
rifle, so they could not link the bullets recovered at the shooting
scenes directly to the weapon.

<HEAD>Cancer Panel Calls for New Pressure to Eliminate Smoking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tobacco should be classified as a drug and
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, a move that could
lead to a ``tobacco-free society by the year 2000,'' a presidential
panel said Wednesday.
   The National Cancer Advisory Board, which conducted a series of
public hearings on cancer prevention, also recommended that smoking
be banned on all airlines and other public transportation and in the
workplace, public buildings and schools.
   Smokeless tobacco, the report said, should be banned in schools
as well and called on professional athletic organization to campaign
against its use.
   Congress should pass legislation declaring tobacco to be a drug
and place it under the control of the FDA, a move that would help to
``intensify the pressure and activity in America to eliminate
smoking and tobacco use, creating a tobacco-free society by the year
2000,'' the report said.
   Gary Miller, assistant to the president of the Tobacco Institute,
said the recommendation by the cancer advisory board was ``just
another attempt to create a prohibition of tobacco,'' which he said
``already is one of the most regulated substances in America.''
   Another federal study of tobacco use found that Australia has had
the sharpest decline of smokers, when compared with other major
western industrialized nations including the United States, but that
Australia's smoking rate among men still remains high.
   In a study in the American Journal of Public Health, Australia
has had the sharpest drop in smoking since a campaign began in 1983,
with the percentage of smokers among men 20 and older dropping from
38.9 to 32.9 percent.
   Smoking rates among men in the U.S., Great Britain, Canada,
Norway and Sweden have declined steadily since 1974 and rates are
lower than Australia in the United States, Canada and Sweden.
   John Pierce, chief of the epidemiology branch of the Public
Health Service, said the decline of smokers in Australia ``is
impressive,'' but that the Pacific Ocean nation is ``still playing
catchup.''
   The report by the presidential board was based on information
gathered in public hearings in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, Miami
and Philadelphia. The study said that a third of all testimony dealt
``entirely or in part with smoking and related subjects and their
relationship to the prevention of cancer.''
   As a result, the board said its report emphasizes ``that
eradication of tobacco use is essential and would have measurable
results in reducing cancer mortality.''
   Other recommendations from the presidential board included:
   _ Increased accessibility and affordability of cancer detection
procedures, particularly for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer.
   _ Expanded accessibility of cancer prevention information to the
poor, elderly, blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and native
Americans.
   _ Expanded involvement of the private sector in cancer prevention
with work site programs.
   _ Expanded cancer education efforts in the media and in
professional and civic organizations.
   _ Encouraging participation of the nation's schools in cancer
prevention and detection.
   _ Enhanced involvement of state and local governments in cancer
prevention and screening, and the control of environmental cancer
risk factors.
   The National Cancer Advisory Board was named by President Reagan
as part of the National Cancer Institute's effort to reduce cancer
by half among Americans by the year 2000.

   The United States would be willing to consider
a mediation role to help end Mozambique's civil war but is seeking
clarifications regarding South Africa's proposed peace plan, U.S.
officials said Wednesday.
   The comments by U.S. officials responded to a call Tuesday by
South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha for the United States to
mediate an end to the 12-year civil war in Mozambique.
   ``We welcome South Africa's expression of interest in ending the
tragic conflict in Mozambique that has brought endless suffering and
death to hundreds of thousands of Mozambiquan citizens,'' said State
Department spokesman Charles Redman.
   ``We encourage the government and people of Mozambique to achieve
a durable peace in their country. If that government were to ask us
to play a role in this regard, we would be prepared to give
thoughtful consideration to exactly how we could be of assistance,
either as mediator or otherwise,'' Redman said.
   But the United States is uncertain whether Botha's proposal
includes the rebel Mozambique National Resistance, known as RENAMO,
said another official.
   ``We are seeking clarification on that,'' said E. Gibson Lanpher,
the department's top official for southern Africa. Lanpher also said
``it's an open question whether the South African government has
made that decision'' of stopping aid to RENAMO.
   South Africa helped RENAMO in the early 1980s but says it stopped
such aid in 1984 under terms of an agreement with the government.
However, the Mozambique government continues to accuse South Africa
of aiding RENAMO.
   ``It is clear that South Africa's longstanding relations with
RENAMO give it the ability to play a constructive role in ending the
conflict if it's prepared to do so,'' Redman said.
   In testimony Wednesday to the House Appropriations Committee's
subcommittee on foreign operations, a refugee organization that
operates in the region said it was skeptical of South Africa's
claims that its support for RENAMO had ceased.
   William Frelick of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a private
group, said RENAMO ``is the Khmer Rouge of Africa, and Mozambique is
its killing field.''
   RENAMO engages in ``systematic visciousness that puts it in a
class by itself,'' including mutilations of babies, forced labor of
the elderly, looting, torture and the killing of more than 100,000
people, he said.
   A State Department human rights report issued this week agrees
with this assessment, but disagrees with human rights groups'
suggestions that the RENAMO brutality has increased.

<HEAD>FAA Administrator Stepping Down After Montreal Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allan McArtor will step down as head of the
Federal Aviation Administration after he returns from a meeting on
international terrorism in Montreal next week, an FAA spokesman said
Wednesday.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who will lead the U.S.
delegation to the special session of the Council of the
International Civil Aviation Organization Feb. 15-16, announced on
Tuesday that McArtor would be replaced.
   Skinner said McArtor had asked to return to private business. The
new transportation secretary said he has ``one or two'' good
candidates for FAA administrator but would not say whom he might
recommend. The post is a filled by presidential appointment and
requires Senate confirmation.
   McArtor, 46, has been FAA head since July 1987. He was a
decorated Vietnam War combat pilot. Prior to his appointment, he was
a senior vice president of Federal Express, the overnight parcel
delivery service.
   McArtor has not announced his plans after leaving office. FAA
spokesman John Leyden said the administrator's resignation would
tentatively take effect Feb. 17.
   Relatives of people killed in the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Scotland, which killed 270 people, had called for
McArtor's resignation earlier in the week. They blamed the FAA for
failing to secure the flight and warn passengers of threats against
it.
   McArtor, however, had indicted earlier that he would be leaving.
   The Montreal meeting, called by the United States and Britain and
expected to include high-level representatives of 31 other nations
on the council, was prompted by the destruction of Flight 103 and is
to discuss ways to protect aviation from terrorists.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II urged Christians at the
beginning of Lent on Wednesday not to fall prey to hypocrisy,
ideologies and worldly fads.
   Lent, a period of fasting and penitence before Easter, should
bring a ``purification of the heart,'' he said in remarks at his
general audience.
   John Paul's observation of Ash Wednesday, the opening day of
Lent, included an afternoon Mass at the fifth century Saint Sabina
Church on the Aventine Hill.
   The pope said purification of the heart means purification of
thoughts, intentions, desires and passions ``so that our external
behavior is really sincere and not the fruit of that hypocrisy and
`human glory' against which Christ was so severe.''
   ``The subtle temptation, for us Christians, is that of appearing
Christian without really being so, stooping to pacts with ideologies
and with the fads of this world,'' the pope told several thousand
pilgrims and tourists in Paul VI Auditorium.
   ``May this penitential season of Lent be for us an occasion for a
sincere examination of conscience,'' John Paul said.

<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new graf 11, bgng ``Diplomatic sources,'' to update

<TEXT>
   The United States has formally notified the
Palestine Liberation Organization of its ``serious concern'' over
the PLO's clash with Israelis in southern Lebanon, the State
Department announced Wednesday.
   Robert Pelletreau, the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, registered the
U.S. view at a meeting in Tunis with Hakam Balloui, a PLO
representative, department spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   Israel has charged five guerrillas from the PLO were attempting
to infiltrate when they were intercepted and slain Saturday in a
security zone Israel has established across its border in southern
Lebanon.
   Accusing the PLO of terrorism, the Israeli government took the
position the United States should break off its three-month-old
dialogue with the PLO, which was based on a renunciation of
terrorism by Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Redman declined to say whether the State Department considered
the incident an act of terrorism or to give details of Pelletreau's
discussion with Balloui.
   ``I'm not going to be able to give a readout on those meetings,''
Redman said. ``I'm just going to confirm that Ambassador Pelletreau
met with the PLO's representative in Tunis and raised our serious
concern over the incident in Lebanon.''
   Meanwhile, Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad called on Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and then told reporters: ``We feel this
whole dialogue was not warranted by the realities and by the
behavior of the PLO, and we keep to the same position and the same
view.''
   The Israeli government takes the position that the clash Saturday
violated Arafat's renunciation of terrorism.
   ``In our view,'' Arad said, ``the actions of the last few weeks
indicate that they haven't changed their character, they haven't
changed their involvement in terrorist acts. The incident last week
along the Israeli-Lebanese border was just another demonstration of
their continuous involvement in terrorist acts.''
   Arad declined to say what Baker had told him about the U.S. stand
on the PLO, but the Israeli ambassador said he was pleased with the
meeting.
   Diplomatic sources said Baker assured the ambassador the United
States had taken note of the incident and was looking into it. The
sources, declining to be identified, said Baker was noncommittal
about future U.S. relations with the PLO.
   The department said Tuesday it was investigating the incident and
that Pelletreau had been instructed to take the matter up
immediately with PLO officials.
   Pelletreau is the designated U.S. contact with the PLO, which
makes its headquarters in Tunis.
   Former President Reagan broke a 13-year ban last December on U.S.
talks with the PLO after Arafat made a statement renouncing
terrorism and recognizing Israel's right to exist. Former Assistant
Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy and other senior U.S. officials
cautioned the dialogue would be suspended if the PLO violated the
pledge.
   Identification carried by four slain Palestinians and one
Lebanese involved in the clash Saturday indicated they belonged to
two radical factions of the PLO.
   Redman had reserved judgment Tuesday on whether the Arafat pledge
had been violated. But he was critical of the PLO, saying ``we take
this incident very seriously. It can have a negative impact on the
U.S.-PLO dialogue and the atmosphere necessary for a positive
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.''
   The department has released its annual human rights report to
Congress containing sharp criticism of Israel's treatment of
Palestinian Arabs living on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Several other countries were accused of widespread human rights
abuses, but attention has centered on Israel and the report's
accusations.
   The Israeli government has denounced the charges as exaggerated
and unjustified.

   Organized crime will soon control legalized
gambling on Indian reservations if the federal government doesn't
act, a gambling manager for a mob organization told a Senate
subcommittee Wednesday.
   The secret witness told the panel that organized crime families
already run 12 of the 90 Indian gambling operations that he knows
about. Fifty percent of the operations have some link to organized
crime, usually through the purchase of supplies from Mafia-owned
companies, he said.
   The man's wore a gray hood and testified behind a screen to hide
his identity. In addition, his voice was electronically altered.
   ``The Indians need help,'' the witness told a special
investigative panel of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs. ``Organized crime is destroying the reservations.''
   The witness said he managed a bingo operation on a large
reservation in the western United States for one of the major
organized crime families.
   The witness disputed Anthony Daniels, deputy assistant director
of the criminal investigation for the FBI, who told the panel that
infiltration of Indian gambling by organized crime is still fairly
limited.
   ``The FBI is wrong,'' the witness said. ``They are not getting
the right information from whatever source they are getting it.''
   He said he knew from meetings with organized crime members and
operators of other Indian gaming operations that mob infiltration is
widespread and growing. ``In 10 years it will be totally out of
hand.''
   He said he paid the chief $1,000 a week and employed most of the
chief's family at the bingo hall, but added he didn't think the
tribe knew he was working for organized the Mafia.
   The Pittstown, Pa.-based Bufalino family, the New York City-based
Lucchese family and the nationwide network set up by the late Meyer
Lansky are the organized crime groups which are most heavily
involved with Indian gambling, he said.
   The witness, who said he has 25 years experience in gambling
operations, said organized crime families set up businessmen, like
himself, as fronts to manage gaming on the reservations.
   ``Great deals of money that should go to the tribe are taken out
of the bingo hall,'' he said.
   He said the mob skimmed at least $600,000 to $700,000 a year from
the bingo operation, while the tribe received less than $100,000.
   In mob-controlled gambling, the family usually owned the bingo
supply company and sold non-existent or over-priced supplies to the
reservation, he said. A Mafia-owned construction company would have
built the bingo hall, using overpriced material and labor and would
operate the food and gift concessions within the building.
   Games would often be rigged so that an employee of the family won
prizes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, he said. Sometimes
drawings would be held for items such as expensive cars and a crime
family member or employee would be assured of winning the prize.
   Mob operations frequently used the bingo games to launder money
from other illegal businesses, such as drug dealing, the witness
said.
   He said he also knows that on some reservations, organized crime
families have set up laboratories to manufacture illegal drugs,
although he didn't elaborate.
   As bingo manager, he earned $2,500 a week, along with a
percentage of the money skimmed off the operation and a percentage
of the profits, the witness said.
   When the witness was asked what would happen if he tried to run a
bingo operation separate from the mob, he answered, ``This committee
would be sending flowers to my family.''
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs is useless in helping the Indians,
he said. For example, when the FBI came to his reservation to
inquire about the bingo operation, he simply told them to get off
the property and they did.
   Organized crime families view Indian reservations they same way
they once looked at Cuba, he said. ``Wide open, no regulations, no
controls.''
   The solution, he said, is that ``a police force should be formed
under federal control that could supply the Indians with information
they need (about the bingo managers) and could go in and look at the
books.''
   FBI agent Richard James Elroy, who has been assigned to the
special Senate investigative committee for the last year, testified
that corruption is pervasive among Indian tribes in the United
States, but often federal laws are inadequate to prosecute
wrongdoers.
   He acknowledged the sovereignty of Indian reservations and the
restrictions on federal government intervention, comparing tribal
governments to individual states or city governments.
   But, he said prosecution is more difficult because, ``for some
reason tribal governments are not included in the code for treatment
like state governments would be.''
   As for oversight by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Elroy said the
BIA ``is hamstrung.''
   He said the relationship between the BIA and the tribes is
intimate. He said he knew of three BIA directors who were removed
when tribal leaders told Washington they wanted the director out.

<TEXT>
   The Security Council urged Iran and Iraq on
Wednesday to make progress toward a peace agreement and authorized
U.N. peacekeepers to continue monitoring the truce.
   By unanimous vote, the 15-member council called on the Persian
Gulf neighbors to ``immediately implement Security Council
Resolution 598,'' passed in July 1987, which provides for a
cease-fire, withdrawal from each other's territory, prisoner
exchange and peace talks.
   Wednesday's resolution extended through Sept. 30 the mandate of
the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, the 350 peacekeepers who
monitor a cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20 after nearly eight
years of war.
   Peace talks opened in Geneva Aug. 25, but became deadlocked
almost immediately over Iraq's demand that Iran allow dredging of
the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms their southern frontier.
Whether the border runs down the middle of the Shatt or on the
Iranian bank is a major point of contention.
   Iran rejects preconditions and insist on immediate troop
withdrawal. Iraq still occupies an estimated 260 square miles of
Iranian territory captured just before the truce.
   Diplomats in Baghdad, capital of Iraq, said privately Wednesday
that Iraqi and Iranian officers would meet under U.N. sponsorship
near the Iranian town of Qasr-e Shirin in the border no-man's land.
   They said 10 officers from each side would take part in the
meeting organized by special U.N. envoy Jan Eliasson in an effort to
spur the negotiations.
   Eliasson, the Swedish U.N. ambassador and Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar's representative at the peace talks, visited
Baghdad and Tehran late last month but no progress on major issues
was evident.
   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq are expected to meet with
Perez de Cuellar this wek. Tariq Aziz of Iraq is in New York and Ali
Akbar Velayati of Iran was expected Thursday.
   Velayati said Monday in Tehran he expected a new round of direct
peace talks to begin soon, but did not mention a date.

<TEXT>
   The cost of telephone service rose 1.3 percent
in 1988, far less than the 4.4 percent overall increase in
inflation, the Federal Communications Commission said Wednesday.
   The FCC said residential phone service cost an average $12.33 in
October 1988 for unlimited calling, excluding long-distance rates.
The same service cost an average $12.44 in October 1987 and $12.58
in October 1986, the FCC said.
   When subscriber line charges and taxes are included, the average
rate for unlimited calling in October was $16.59.
   The FCC said Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that the
real cost of telephone service, including long-distance, dropped
about 3 percent in 1988 when inflation is taken into consideration.
   In 1987, the cost of telephone service also dropped 1.3 percent,
compared with a 4.4 percent increase in inflation, for a real
decline of nearly 6 percent.
   The figures were reported in the FCC's Telephone Rates Update, a
twice-yearly survey of phone costs in 95 cities.
   The survey found that local service rates increased 4.5 percent
on average, while state toll rates decreased 4.2 percent. Interstate
long-distance rates also dropped 4.2 percent on average.
   The agency said that for the first time its survey included local
business telephone service.
   It found that single line business customers paid an average of
$40.06 per month for local touch tone service, including subscriber
line charges and taxes, and 200 short calls in cities where
unlimited calling was not offered.
   The FCC said lower-priced options for phone service, such as
Lifeline and Link Up, were provided in 92 of the 95 cities surveyed.
The average monthly price for the lowest priced, generally available
service was $9.20, including subscriber line charges and taxes.
   Subscriber line charges _ currently $2.60 a month for residential
customers _ are the fees local telephone companies charge to connect
customers with long-distance networks.

   Californians awoke Wednesday to frosted
freeways, Christmas music on the radio and snow falling on such
unlikely spots as Malibu beach as an icy Pacific storm chilled out
commuters and threatened crops.
   ``I've often wondered what would happen if snow fell on our
freeways, and it's worse than I thought,'' said veteran traffic
reporter Bill Keene of radio station KNX-AM.
   Other radio stations played Christmas songs such as ``Winter
Wonderland'' and told listeners how to make snowballs and snowmen.
   ``We decided that with snow falling in Southern California, it
just felt like the holidays, and we dusted off some Christmas
records,'' said Mike Wagner, program director at KRLA-AM in Los
Angeles.
   The unusual snowfall was the result of a storm that began off the
California coast running into the frigid air that has settled over
much of the state in recent days, according to the National Weather
Service. The result was a seasonal storm that brought snow instead
of rain to several areas.
   Much of the lower 48 states have dealt with more than a week of
record cold because of the bitter arctic air that moved in from
Alaska. Temperatures were beginning to return to normal in some
areas but record-breaking cold continued in several cities.
   More arctic air moving Wednesday across the warmer Great Lakes
was producing lake-effect snow in Michigan, Ohio and New York.
   In California, snowflakes fell but quickly melted on the streets
of Palm Springs and on the sands of Malibu, residents of the winter
resorts said. The Agoura Hills and headlands above the beaches at
Malibu kept a coat of snow into the morning. Icicles hung from the
chaparral brush of the beach community.
   ``Every once in a while the wind blows some flakes down here on
the beach,'' said Bill Gould, who works at a gas station in Malibu.
   Up to six inches of snow fell in some outlying Los Angeles
suburbs, closing some roadways, and a few schools were shuttered for
the day. Snow in the Los Angeles suburbs is rare, but not
unprecedented.
   The city of Santa Clarita, 35 miles northwest of Los Angeles, was
virtually shut down for the morning.
   Citrus growers in the center of the state said damage from night
after night of temperatures in the 20s might run into the tens of
millions of dollars. Some flower growers in northern California
feared their crops were ruined.
   The snow brought out surprised residents in their nightclothes.
Snowmen shared the front lawns with palm trees, and cross country
skiers were spotted where joggers had been the day before.
   Wide-eyed drivers clung to steering wheels as their cars slid
over icy patches, and children reveled in the white stuff, using
flattened cardboard boxes as makeshift sleds.
   ``I think it's very cool,'' said 11-year-old Laura Ruhland of
Santa Clarita, who awoke before dawn to play in the snow. ``I don't
think we'll be going to school today. I'm going to the park to make
a snowman. The trees outside all look like Christmas.''
   San Francisco on Wednesday had its fifth consecutive morning with
temperatures 39 degrees or below, the first time in history there's
been such a stretch in February.
   Californians who took the icy roadway commuter challenge found
their cars going sideways, over the side, or not at all. There was a
run on tire chains.
   ``I've sold at least 15 to 20 sets already. It's crazy,'' said
Chris Gardner, the assistant manager of Chief Auto Parts in Canyon
Country, about 30 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   Farmers overnight fired up smudge pots, turned on wind machines
and called in helicopters to protect their crops from frost damage.
Threatened were grapes, strawberries, grapefruit, oranges and
peppers.
   Southern California citrus, avocado and strawberry growers
escaped crop damage Tuesday night because temperatures didn't go low
enough, but there may have been some damage in the San Joaquin
Valley, said Curt Anderson of the Sunkist growers' cooperative.
   In San Mateo County, where a $165 million floral industry serves
wholesalers along the West Coast and the New England states,
Agriculture Commissioner George Ginilo said field flower growers
suffered ``a total loss'' because of the freezing weather. Blooms
have withered on the county's primary field crop, the Marguerite
daisy, he said.
   ``There's gonna be a shortage right now. They're just not
blooming,'' said Mark Yamaguchi, a grower-shipper of carnations in
Monterey County.

<HEAD>Democrats Ready to Choose Black Chairman, Mull Impact on South</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Democrats gathered to elect the first black
chairman of a major political party, they were told Wednesday to
find presidential candidates who are ``able to speak to the South''
as well as to white Protestant voters.
   Pollster Peter Hart pointed out to the party's executive
committee that in the 1988 presidential election, Republican George
Bush won 155 electoral votes in the South compared to zero for
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   ``You can't start out any game behind 155 to 0 and be
competitive,'' Hart said.
   Hart also said that 48 percent of all voters are white
Protestants.
   ``We have to be able to talk to them,'' he said.
   In the 1988 campaign, Hart said the Republicans ran on values
such as anti-crime and pro-defense while the Democrats ran on
programs.
   ``We've got to be able to get from programs to values,'' he added.
   After two days of preliminary sessions, the Democratic National
Committee will convene on Friday to select Ronald H. Brown as the
next party chairman.
   Brown, a former aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Jesse Jackson,
is unopposed for the top party job. But his impending election was
raising questions about the help or harm it might bring,
particularly in the South.
   ``Will it help?'' asked Atlanta-based pollster Claibourne Darden.
``The answer is no. What can Ron Brown do to help the Democratic
Party? Bring the liberal vote to it? It's already there.
   ``Bring the black vote to it? It's already there.''
   Merle Black, professor of political science at the University of
North Carolina, said Republicans would use Brown's election to put
out the message to Southern whites that ``the Democratic Party now
is the party of blacks.''
   Still another analyst of Southern politics, Larry Sabato, of the
University of Virginia, said Brown's election could cause problems
for Democrats in the region ``not so much because he's black, but
that he's tied to the twin devils, Ted Kennedy and Jesse Jackson.''
   Among the Democrats, two new studies were circulating of
political trends in the region that was once the party' most
reliable base.
   One looked at 1988 presidential election returns in seven
Southern states and disclosed that Republican George Bush
consistently beat Democrat Michael Dukakis in the region's fastest
growing and most affluent counties.
   Bush swept the Deep South on Nov. 8. Dukakis' best showing was in
Louisiana where he trailed with 45 percent of the vote. He received
40 percent or less in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South
Carolina, and Virginia.
   The second study focused on Alabama and urged the state
Democratic Party there to ``turn its attention toward gaining a
greater understanding of why it has failed to capture significant
support within Alabama's white voting population.''
   Written by pollster and DNC member Natalie Davis, the study
concluded that in Alabama ``the Democratic Party has been a
no-growth party.''
   Concern over the party's dwindling appeal among white voters in
the South became an issue in the campaign for party chairman.
However, Brown overcame four rivals in the contest to succeed Paul
G. Kirk Jr.
   With the exception of 1976, when Georgian Jimmy Carter was the
Democratic presidential nominee, Republicans have carried the South
in recent national elections.
   When Carter ran for re-election against Ronald Reagan in 1980,
the Democratic incumbent's Southern base shrank to his home state.
Walter F. Mondale was shut out in the South four years later.
   In its study of 1988 election returns in seven Southern states,
the Institute for Southern Studies found that the counties carried
by Bush were ``richer, whiter, and growing nearly twice as fast as
the counties carried by Dukakis.''
   In addition, the analysis determined that Bush was strongest in
areas with the highest voter turnout.
   ``The numbers show that the Democratic ticket in November just
didn't excite voters the way the Republican ticket did,'' said Bob
Hall, research director of the institute.
   Ms. Davis said her analysis of the 1988 returns in Alabama
indicated that Dukakis received between 25 and 30 percent of the
white vote there, which actually was an improvement over Mondale's
showing of about 20 percent.
   She said her polling found that in 1981, 51 percent of white
voters in Alabama identified themselves as Democrats and 32 percent
as Republicans. Her latest survey taken in October 1988 found those
numbers reversed with 52 percent calling themselves Republicans and
33 percent Democrats.
   She said that while many voters ``reject the Democratic Party
because it has black support ... there are other factors which argue
against so simplistic an analysis.''
   Darden said the identification of the Democrats as the party of
blacks was growing in the South.
   ``One thing we don't need in the South or in this country,'' he
said, ``is the Democratic Party to be a black party and the
Republican Party to be a white party. That doesn't help anybody and
it's an unreversable role right now in the South.''
   What could change that is if the Republicans succeed in
attracting black votes, an avowed goal of the new GOP chairman, Lee
Atwater.
   Then, said Darden ``we can get back to the politics of class''
where voters are influenced most by economic arguments.

   The nation's largest producer of manufactured
homes, Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., has agreed to pay $945,000 to
settle a federal suit charging it failed to meet federal
construction and safety standards, the government said Wednesday.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development said the
agreement settles a suit filed by the government in U.S. District
Court in Wilmington, Del., in 1988 alleging that 20,000 Fleetwood
manufactured homes built in 1983 and 1984 failed to meet such
standards.
   HUD, in a prepared statement, said its investigators concluded
the homes had substandard walls and roof restraints, making them
subject to damage.
   Glenn Kummer, president of Fleetwood Enterprises in Riverside,
Calif., said that in making the payment the company ``hasn't
admitted that the homes violated any standards.'' Company vice
president and general counsel William Lear said the settlement ended
a series of disputes over ``engineering interpretations.''
   The settlement also covered a case in which an administrative law
judge found similar violations of federal construction and safety
standards in 4,000 homes produced by Fleetwood Homes of Texas
between 1980 and 1984, according to a statement issued by HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp.

<HEAD>SEC Proposes to Crack Down on High-Pressure Phone Tactics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Wednesday proposed new rules that would crack down on stockbrokers
who use high-pressure telephone tactics to sell penny stocks.
   The stocks typically sell for less than $3 a share. Some are
issued by legitimate companies, but many are sold by companies with
an erratic earnings history.
   The stocks can be thinly traded and it is often difficult for an
investor to accurately judge their value. Brokers sometimes take
extra-large commissions on penny stock sales.
   The SEC rule, proposed by a 5-0 vote, would not entirely ban
unsolicited ``cold calls.'' However, it would require brokerage
firms to sign a written agreement with a new customer before
completing a transaction.
   Brokers would also have to interview new customers to determine
if they were suitable for risky investments and keep the suitability
documents on file for inspection by regulators.
   Final action could come in 30 to 60 days after the agency reviews
public comment.
   The president of a group representing state regulators, the North
American Securities Administrators Association, praised the proposal
as ``a meaningful effort to provide front-end protection against
some of the worst abuses and fraud in the penny stock market.''
   ``The commission is signaling to the industry and the little guy
that it intends to proceed in a very serious fashion,'' said John
Baldwin, president of the association and director of the Utah
Securities Division.
   The SEC has identified six areas where penny stock fraud is
prevalent: south Florida, New Jersey, Nevada, Los Angeles, Denver
and Utah.
   Last October, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder established a task
force on penny stock manipulation. According to the agency's staff,
about 325 brokerage firms sell penny stocks, up from 55 a few years
ago.
   The proposed rules apply to so-called ``pink sheet'' stocks,
issued by companies with fewer than $300,000 in assets. The pink
sheets are published by the National Quotation Bureau Inc., a
private firm.
   Stocks traded on exchanges or through the automated system of the
National Association of Securities Dealers would be exempt from the
rule. Also, brokers could sell to large institutional investors
without meeting the stricter requirements for individual investors.

   Christianity's chief leader in Soviet Armenia
said Wednesday that under Soviet reforms ``the spiritual life and
authority of the church has become more influential among the
people.''
   There is now ``total respect for the church,'' said Catholicos
Vasken I of Etchmiadzin, whose title is supreme patriarch and
Catholicos of all Armenians.
   ``This is is only a beginning,'' he added in an interview. ``We
will have the opportunity to progress in this cause.''
   The catholicos, or pontiff, said policy changes under Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev have enabled the opening and renovation of
churches and monasteries, increased baptisms and ``general interest
in spiritual life has developed.
   He said clergy now are permitted to visit hospital patients to
pray with them and read passages of the Bible.
   ``The doctors suggest priests visit more often because the visits
are helpful in hastening recovery of patients,'' he said.
   Vasken, in the United States on a nine-day pastoral visit to help
develop plans for rebuilding earthquake-ravaged northern Armenia,
meets with President Bush on Thursday.
   He was accompanied by Catholicos Karekin II of Cilicia, based in
Beirut, Lebanon, the second-ranking Armenian see. It has had
prolonged jurisdictional friction with the ``mother see'' at
Etchmiadzin.
   However, Vasken said ``the situation is better. We are in
conversation toward creating cooperation.''
   He said talks had been going on before the earthquake disaster,
but it had further solidified relations. ``It gave us the
opportunity to come together and plan,'' he said.
   ``We already were brothers. But there were problems to be
resolved. Together we have agreed on taking certain steps toward
cooperation.''

<TEXT>
   A former highway commissioner was sentenced
Wednesday for extortion after being caught up in a corruption
investigation that also led to the resignation of another man on the
three-member commission.
   Former Southern District Highway Commissioner Bob Joiner, 59, was
sentenced to six years in prison on the federal extortion charge and
received a five-year suspended sentence on a tax evasion count.
   U.S. District Judge Tom S. Lee told Joiner a pre-sentencing
report showed ``you blatantly solicited kickbacks from contractors''
and that ``the only redeeming factor in your behalf is that you have
cooperated with the prosecutor.''
   Joiner, of Waynesboro, was indicted in December 1987 on 11
federal counts following a federal probe with cooperation from
then-state Auditor Ray Mabus, whose office had been investigating
the state Highway Department since 1985.
   Nine charges were dismissed when Joiner cooperated with
investigators.
   Joiner was accused of extorting $238,156 from four construction
contractors and of underestimating his income tax from 1981-84.
   He could have been sentenced to up to 25 years. In recommending
the six-year sentence, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ruth Harris noted
that Joiner had participated in a federal investigation that led to
obstruction of justice charges against former Marion County
Supervisor Sim Ed Moree.
   Moree was sentenced Tuesday to almost seven years in prison.
   Harris said Joiner also participated in the investigation that
led to a filing of court documents in December implicating
then-Central District Highway Commissioner Sam Waggoner. He resigned
later in the month.
   Waggoner had been scheduled to enter a guilty plea to the charges
Monday, but his court appearance was delayed because of an ice storm
that hit the state. It has not been rescheduled.
   Joiner first took office in 1980 and had begun serving a third
term in January 1988. He resigned last May. A special election was
held in July to replace Joiner and a special election next month
will fill the remaining three years in Waggoner's term.
   The commission directs state road building in Mississippi and
oversees the 3,200-employee Highway Department.

   President Bush has decided to retain two
Cabinet-level councils set up by former President Reagan, one
dealing with domestic and the other with economic policy, the White
House said Wednesday.
   A statement issued by the office of White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said that Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady would
generally preside over the the Economic Policy Committee and
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh over the Domestic Policy Council.
   The economic unit is made up of the secretaries of State,
Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, budget director, the U.S.
trade representative and the chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers.
   The domestic unit is made up of the secretaries of Interior,
Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Develop, Energy,
Education, Veterans Affairs, the budget director and the
Environmental Protection Agency.

   Italian authorities on Wednesday seized a
Danish freighter loaded with more than 200 tons of Czechoslovak arms
bound for Latin America, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
   The agency said police arrested 11 people and confiscated 5,200
cases of rifles, pistols, submachine guns and ammunition that they
valued at $8.1 million.
   The weapons were found in the holds of the Jane Star, a Danish
ship that brought the cargo from Hamburg, West Germany, to Savona,
where it was to be loaded on another undentified ship and sent to
unspecified Central and South American countries, ANSA said.
   The agency said the ship carried two manifests, one for the
countries of destination and another for Italy that listed the cargo
as machine parts.
   Italian police arrested nine members of the crew when they
boarded the ship Wednesday afternoon in this port west of Genoa on
the Ligurian coast, ANSA said. At about the same time, two men
suspected of being involved in the arms trafficking were arrested at
the airport in Genoa, it said.

<TEXT>
   The governing National Party's new
leader, F.W. de Klerk, said Wednesday he is committed both to equal
rights for blacks and to whites-only communities.
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said criticism of South Africa's
human rights record by the U.S. State Department was ``one-sided and
unsubstantiated.''
   De Klerk told Parliament, in his first major address since being
chosen as party chief last week, the government must develop a
constitution that protects the rights of both whites and blacks.
   ``I want to state unequivocally that the National Party is
against domination of any one group by others,'' he said. ``White
domination, in so far as it still exists, must go.''
   He also said the government remains committed to segregated
neighborhoods, schools and other facilities under the principle of
``group rights.''
   ``A strong emphasis on group rights, alongside individual rights,
is based on the reality of South Africa and not on an ideological
obsession or racial prejudice,'' he said.
   Under South Africa's apartheid policy of racial segregation, the
5 million whites maintain political and economic control over the
country's 26 million blacks, who have no vote in national affairs.
   At a briefing for foreign journalists after the Parliament
speech, de Klerk declared support for gradual and limited race
reforms.
   ``The crux of what I wanted to get across was to commit the
National Party to the very same road which ... President P.W. Botha
has taken the party on,'' he said.
   He visited Botha at his Cape Town residence Wednesday but would
not give details of the meeting.
   Botha relinquished the party leadership after suffering a stroke,
and de Klerk, 52, was chosen Feb. 2 to succeed him. The National
Party has governed South Africa since 1948 and made apartheid into
law.
   The president has indicated he will resume official duties when
he recovers. De Klerk is considered heir apparent. Chris Heunis, the
constitutional development minister, now is acting president.
   De Klerk is seen as a cautious pragmatist who supports gradual
expansion of black rights while keeping real political power in
white hands. Although he said Wednesday the government is ready to
negotiate a new constitution with blacks, few black leaders agree to
talk without further reforms.
   Pressure on the right comes from the Conservative Party, which
sees Botha's limited reforms as capitulation to the black majority.
   Foreign Minister Botha, no relation to the president, said the
State Department ``ignores the government obligation to maintain law
and order against terrorism in South Africa while at the same time
it is silent on the acts of terrorism perpetrated by the ANC,'' the
African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   In its annual report on the state of human rights around the
world, released Tuesday, the State Department said South Africa
further curtailed rights last year by clamping down on opponents of
the government and banning peaceful anti-apartheid groups.

<HEAD>Bush Wants to Clean Up Environment Without Stifling Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday he wants to
develop a consensus among industry and environmental interests in an
effort to find ways to clean up the environment ``without stifling
the economy.''
   Americans are impatient for results on environmental cleanup,
Bush said at swearing-in ceremonies for Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan Jr. and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William
K. Reilly, the two top officials who will guide his administration's
environmental efforts.
   ``They won't accept excuses anymore and they won't accept
finger-pointing. They want us to get all the sides together and find
a way to achieve both their goals,'' he told a gathering at EPA
headquarters where Reilly was sworn in.
   His comments came the day before his address to Congress in which
he will deliver budget proposals on his spending priorities on the
environment as well as other matters.
   Bush's visit to EPA was the first by a president since the agency
was created in 1970. Reilly noted this when he made his remarks
following his swearing in.
   ``You are not dreaming. This is the president of the United
States,'' said the former head of the Conservation Foundation and of
the U.S. affiliate of the World Wildlife Fund.
   He said Bush came because ``he cares urgently about protecting
the environment.''
   ``Isn't it encouraging to have an environmentalist in the White
House who comes here to signal his close and public commitment to
the work of the Environmental Protection Agency?'' he said.
   Bush said he wants to build a consensus among environmental and
industry interests to ensure a clean environment.
   ``I believe doing that requires finding ways to clean up the
environment without stifling the economy,'' he said. ``More often
than not there is common ground if the parties will make an effort
to find it,'' he added.
   Bush said Americans want both economic growth and a clean
environment.
   At the Interior Department, Bush said that Lujan, a former
congressman from New Mexico, agreed with him in sharing the
sentiments of former President Theodore Roosevelt who said, ``A
grove of giant redwoods or sequoias should be kept just as we keep a
great and beautiful cathedral.''
   Bush called for conservation and ``wise management'' of public
land.
   During last year's presidential campaign, Bush promised to deal
aggressively with such issues as global warming, toxic waste
disposal and acid rain.
   Reilly said public demand for a clean environment ``has probably
never been firmer.''

<HEAD>Timman Defeats Portisch in Sixth Game; Wins Match</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jan Timman of the Netherlands defeated
Lajos Portisch of Hungary in the final game of their World Chess
Championship Candidates quarterfinal Wednesday to win the six-game
match 3.5-2.5.
   It was the second consecutive victory in the hard-fought contest
for the 37-year-old Dutchman, who had luck on his side, just as in
the previous game, when he tied the match.
   In Wednesday's encounter, he was never in danger of defeat, but
chess experts said a draw was the most he should have gained.
   Portisch played black in the Taimanov variation of the Sicilian
defense and was clearly aiming for a peaceful outcome, which would
have caused the match to go into overtime.
   He sacrificed a pawn and exchanged queens early on, simplifying
the position until the two sides were almost completely evened out.
   Timman had only a virtually worthless extra pawn and a slight
spatial advantage to fight on with.
   But fight on he did, taking risks that made Dutch grandmaster
Genna Sosonko say, ``He might lose the game, and with it the match,
if he goes on like this.''
   It turned out to be part of Timman's strategy.
   ``Just as in the previous game, it was my aim to terrorize my
opponent by doing the unexpected,'' Holland's strongest chess player
said afterwards.
   Unable to stand the strain, Portisch nervously sought to create
counter chances. Experts said he should have resigned himself to a
passive defense.
   About 50 moves into the rooks and bishops endgame, the Hungarian
made the decisive mistake, allowing a white pawn advance on the
queenside.
   Timman quickly concentrated his forces to support the lonely pawn
and coasted to final victory on his 64th, when Portisch resigned
under the thunderous applause of the 200 spectators packing the
tournament hall.
   The victory earned Timman a berth in the semifinals, to be played
in October in London.
   He will play Britain's Jonathan Speelman, while former world
champion Anatoly Karpov takes on fellow Soviet grandmaster Artur
Yusupov in the other semifinal match.
   The winner of the final, whose date and venue remain to be
chosen, gains the right to challenge world champion Gary Kasparov of
the Soviet Union.
   Portisch meanwhile announced his withdrawal from the world
championship race.
   He said he would continue to play tournament chess, but said that
``at 51 and having competed in the Candidates series eight times
since 1964, enough is enough.''

<HEAD>Police Say Stolen Drug Money Bought Young Teens Fling With Luxury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 14-year-old boy took $120,000 in drug
money and treated himself and friends to a three-day spending spree
that ended with a trip to Hawaii, authorities said Wednesday.
   The three teen-agers' life of leisure ended when Kauai police,
alerted to their flight, picked them up on a beach Jan. 10 and
recovered $111,000, police and school officials said.
   Berkeley police would not comment Wednesday on the incident,
which was reported in Wednesday's editions of The (Oakland) Tribune.
   According to Oakland Municipal Court records, one of the boys
said he found the money and two bags of what he said was cocaine in
a false-bottom drawer at a relative's home.
   The 14-year-old left the drugs but took the money and ran, he
told police.
   The teen-ager and some schoolmates set out to enjoy the windfall,
renting a limousine to go to San Francisco, where they persuaded the
driver to rent a room at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, the paper said.
   Rooms at the hotel start at $175 a night but range up to $1,000,
a hotel spokeswoman said. There was no way to tell which room the
youths had, she said.
   After their San Francisco fling, some of the students returned
home, and several recounted their adventure to school officials,
said Willard Junior High Principal Chris Lim.
   The other teen-agers also said they bought stereo equipment and
made reservations through a travel agent to go to Hawaii the next
day.
   The school then alerted the father of a 13-year-old girl thought
to be traveling with the teen-ager who took the money and another
14-year-old boy. The father filed a missing persons' report with
Oakland police, who contacted police in Kauai.
   ``The flight had already arrived when we got the missing persons'
report. So we were looking for them when we got the report of a
surfer in trouble in the Poipu area,'' said Kauai police Capt.
Dennis Higashi.
   The surfer, who was unharmed, turned out to be one of the
teen-agers. The three were detained overnight and sent back to their
parents.
   ``Basically, someone came up with the idea of `Let's go to
Hawaii,''' Kauai police Lt. Vincent Wiskneski said Wednesday.
   Since their return, the three teen-agers have withdrawn from the
junior high school, said Lim.
   The principal denied the Tribune's report that the girl and the
boy who did not take the money went on the run after receiving an
anonymous death threat. The paper cited an unidentified school
official as its source. Berkeley Police said they had no information
about any threat.
   Acting on the statement of the youth who said he took the money,
police in California searched his relative's home and found a bag
containing drug paraphernalia but no narcotics, the paper said.
   Kauai, police, however, determined through conversations with
California authorities that the money came as a result of drug
trafficking, Higashi said.

<HEAD>Strike at Coal Mine Threatens Atmosphere at Talks, Gov't Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 7th graf, `The workers...' to ADD that pay is per month.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike at the nation's largest power
plant picked up strength Wednesday, drawing a sharp government
rebuke that it could mar the atmosphere at continuing talks with the
banned Solidarity trade union.
   The coal mine at the Belchatow power complex 90 miles southwest
of Warsaw was shut down Wednesday with the widening of a partial
work stoppage that started Monday, state television and Solidarity
reported.
   The shutdown came the same day that a working group of about 40
Solidarity and government representatives met in Warsaw on reaching
a consensus on the nation's economic problems. The meeting was part
of broader talks that began Monday.
   The power plant produces 20 percent of Poland's energy, according
to a strike committee spokesman, and was burning its three-day
reserve of coal.
   State TV said 4,000 workers were on strike, while the Solidarity
Information Service in Warsaw put the number at 8,000. The complex
employs 12,500 workers.
   The dispute involves implementation of previously negotiated pay
raises, said Edward Olszewski of the strike committee. He said one
management offer was rejected Wednesday and the situation is ``very
tense'' because of the threat to power supplies for central Poland.
   The workers, led by local Solidarity activists, seek a monthly
pay increase of about $59. The official average wage is about $145 a
month, but the strike committee spokesman said the rate is skewed by
the higher salaries of managers and few workers receive that much.
   The publicly owned complex is part of a coal-and-power monopoly
formed last year in a government restructuring that removed some
industry from direct state control. The government has warned
against enterprises paying wages that exceed their financial
earnings, with raises pegged to higher productivity.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa sent an envoy to see the strikers.
But government spokesman Jerzy Urban accused the envoy, coal miner
Alojzy Pietrzyk, of endorsing and encouraging the strike at a rally
attended by thousands of workers, rather than trying to ease it.
   ``I must express decisive anxiety for the sense of the round
table talks and chances for agreement. Agreement is not posible
under strike pressure,'' Urban said.
   ``The present partners at the round table, linking themselves to
Solidarity traditions, sat at the table for seeking agreement,
rejecting confrontation methods. How then should one assess that a
participant ... referring to Lech Walesa, warms up the workers to
strike?'' Urban told state media.
   Signs of labor tension appeared elsewhere. Workers at the coke
department of the strike-prone Nowa Huta steel mill near Krakow have
been refusing since Feb. 1 to work overtime, Solidarity spokesmen
reported.
   At another power plant, the Dolna Odra near Szczecin, members of
the official trade union told officials they are protesting their
pay, but no strike was declared, according to the state-run PAP news
service.
   Solidarity spokesman Wojciech Maziarski said he had no
information about the Dolna Ordra situation, and that the union was
seeking information from Pietrzyk in order to reply to Urban's
accusations.
   The strike has put both sides in the talks in a delicate
position, since Communist Party officials entered the negotiations
despite internal opposition from hardliners, arguing that an
agreement with Solidarity would help keep labor peace.
   Earlier Wednesday, the government and opposition representatives
held the first meeting of a working group on the economy.
Participants looked at economic and social issues, seeking a
consensus to reverse the stagnation, inflation and shortages that
have sapped Poland's progress. They agreed to meet again Monday.
   ``The debates today were considered by our side as interesting
and promising,'' said government spokesman Zbyslaw Rakowski. Among
the issues raised were price-and-incomes policy, rationing of meat,
the crushing foreign debt and spending on the military, he said.
   A government plan on consolidating the economy was proposed by
authorities as a starting point for the talks, but officials said
they remain ``open to proposals,'' Rykowski said.
   Opposition spokesmen said they emphasized the need for the public
to have a voice in curbing unwise economic decisions by authorities.
   ``We think that all basic decisions in the system of managing the
economy and in economic policy should be under society's control,''
said Witold Trzeciakowski, an economist who led the opposition
delegation.
   Two other working groups on trade unions and political freedoms
will meet this week, all part of the historic talks that have
brought together leaders from the Communist Party, the opposition
and the Roman Catholic Church.
   A chief goal of the negotiations, expected to last up to six
weeks, is the legalization of Solidarity, the East Bloc's first
independent trade union outlawed in 1982 after a martial-law
crackdown. Other reforms also are on the table, including opposition
participation in the communist-controlled parliament.
   Neither Walesa nor Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak were at the
talks Wednesday. Wladyslaw Baka, the ruling Politburo member
responsible for the economy, and Witold Trzeciakowski, an economist
on a ``Citizen's Committee'' formed by Walesa, were the senior
participants.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is
taking control of 224 insolvent savings institutions, announced
Wednesday that it is temporarily halting S&amp;L rescues.
   S&amp;L regulators rescued or propped up 223 institutions last year,
mostly by issuing promissory notes and pledging to cover future
losses. The deals have been criticized as more expensive to tax
payers in the long run.
   The FDIC, a commercial bank regulator, will spend the next month
taking control of the remaining failed S&amp;Ls under orders from
President Bush. In a statement Wednesday, the FDIC said it was
calling a halt to assistance transactions until it can evaluate the
institutions.
   After that, it will only resolve cases that can be supported by
the S&amp;L insurance fund's cash flow. No notes or loss guarantees will
be considered, it said.
   In another development, the president of a quasi-public agency
created to sell loans and property from failed savings institutions
announced his resignation.
   Gerald P. Carmen, former head of the General Services
Administration and a political ally of former President Ronald
Reagan, resigned effective next month as head of the Federal Asset
Disposition Association.
   FADA, established in 1985, had been severely criticized for
conflicts of interest and mismanagement. In a statement, Carmen said
he had turned the agency around in his year at the helm.
   The agency currently manages about 2,500 assets worth $3.8
billion, spokesman Dave Bunton said. He said John Wills, currently
executive vice president, will serve as acting president.
   FADA's fate under Bush's S&amp;L reorganization plan is unclear, he
said.

<HEAD>Government Shelves Research On Rocket With Reported Nuclear Potential</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said it shelved secret
research on a short-range conventional missile on Wednesday, a day
after a televised report that the rocket could also carry nuclear
warheads.
   West Germany's chief government spokesman, Friedhelm Ost,
repeated official denials that the proposed missile, researched by a
U.S. and a West German company, had nuclear potential.
   Ost said shelving the ``Technex'' project was in response to
recent ``positive signals'' in disarmament efforts, including
planned troop reductions by the Warsaw Pact and agreement to begin
East-West conventional weapons talks in March.
   But he said the research could resume if the talks are
unsuccessful.
   The government's move also appeared aimed at heading off any
anger among West Germans after Tuesday's disclosure of the Technex
research project and a claim by the ARD television network that the
weapons system could carry a nuclear warhead.
   Because of a popular perception that the East bloc is no longer a
military threat, there is a growing anti-military mood in West
Germany. That has led to widespread opposition against any move that
could torpedo disarmament efforts and good relations with the East
bloc.
   East Germany's official Communist Party newspaper lashed out at
its Western neighbor over the weapons research.
   The newspaper, Neues Deutschland, said any government doing such
research is not seriously interested in seeing success at the
upcoming Vienna conventional weapons talks.
   ``These parties are at the most using (these talks) to cover up
major disarmament projects,'' the newspaper said in a commentary.
   Ost told reporters that Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Defense
Minister Rupert Scholz made the decision to shelve the Technex
project following ``long talks.''
   ``But both agree that this option should only be completely
abandoned if the conventional weapons talks result in a conventional
balance at a reduced level,'' he added.
   NATO maintains that the Warsaw Pact maintains a strong military
superiority in a number of areas.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Winfried Dunkel on Wednesday said the
U.S. rocket manufacturer Martin Marietta and
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm, a West German aerospace company,
participated in the $54.6 million study.
   He said the two firms were researching the feasibility of a
rocket system with a range of up to 310 miles fitted with a special
conventional warhead to destroy enemy air bases in times of war.
   Udo Philipp, a Messerschmidt spokesman, said the rocket would not
be able to carry a nuclear warhead.
   ``Because of factors of weight, aerodynamics and size, the
warheads would not be interchangeable,'' he said.
   But ARD on Tuesday reported it obtained Defense Ministry
documents showing the weapon would have dual capability.
   Dunkel did not specify what the Technex research achieved but
said it was only a ``technical study,'' that no prototype was built
and no companies were contracted to produce it.
   Dunkel rejected claims by some opposition party members that they
were kept in the dark about the Technex project, saying the
parliamentary defense committee had known about it since June 1987.

   An unusual invasion of freezing Arctic
air has killed 26 people in northern Mexico, including a 65-year-old
invalid burned to death when an open fire ignited her bed, according
to reports Wednesday.
   Growers in Nuevo Leon's vast citrus region south of Monterrey
have been conducting an emergency harvest of oranges, grapefruit and
tangerines since the so-called Alaskan Express moved in last
Saturday.
   Schools in Nuevo Leon state have been closed all week, and the
Mexico City newspaper La Jornada said officials in neighboring
Chihuahua and Tamaulipas states also ordered schools closed.
Temperatures in urban areas dipped to 18 degrees Tuesday night.
   Drivers unaccustomed to icy roads lost control of their vehicles,
and more than 100 minor accidents were reported in the Monterrey
metropolitan area Tuesday. Police reported no serious injuries.
   Maria del Refugio Oliva de Saucedo burned to death in her tiny
shack in Monterrey when an open fire she was using to ward off the
cold ignited the blankets as she slept, Monterrey newspapers
reported.
   El Porvenir quoted state police as saying 25 more people in the
region, most of them children, died of weather-related causes. It
said most of the deaths were caused by pneumonia or other bronchial
illnesses.
   The Nuevo Leon governor's office reported that, despite the cold,
only 350 people spent Tuesday night in 21 emergency shelters
established for indigents.
   Citrus growers said it was too early to estimate freeze-related
damage to 110,000 tons of oranges ready for harvest next month in
Montemorelos, hub of the Nuevo Leon citrus region about 50 miles
southwest of Monterrey.
   Alberto Escamilla Elizondo, the state agriculture secretary, was
quoted in the federal government newspaper El Nacional as saying the
crop could withstand temperatures of 18 degrees for up to 24 hours.
Much of the citrus grown in Nuevo Leon is exported to the United
States.
   A freeze in 1983 destroyed half the state's 8 million citrus
trees and production levels have just begun to reach former levels.
   About 300 head of cattle died because of the cold in Tamaulipas
state, the government news agency Notimex reported Wednesday. It
said budding crops of corn, beans and sorghum were affected, but did
not give loss estimates.
   The Agriculture Department meteorological service said the freeze
could last through Thursday.

<HEAD>Cold Temperatures Linger; Snow Falls In Great Lakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell in the Great Lakes states and the mountains of Southern
California on Wednesday and a new blast of arctic air pushed
temperatures below zero in some north-central states.
   The snow in the Great Lakes region was the result of cold arctic
air flowing across warmer waters. Snow was falling across northern
Upper Michican and western lower Michigan and east of Lake Erie and
Lake Ontario.
   Keweenaw Peninsula of Upper Michigan received between 3 and 6
inches; Traverse City had at least 6 inches; and Sault St. Marie had
3 inches for a total of 19 inches on the ground. Visibilities were
near zero because of blowing and drifting snow, especially near the
Michigan communities of Marquette and Munsing.
   A low pressure system off the coast of Southern California
produced snow over the mountains of Southern California. Snow fell
in parts of the San Fernando, San Gabriel and San Bernardino valleys
on Wednesday and major mountain passes were closed. Snow also fell
at Las Vegas.
   Along with the snow, strong winds with gusts higher than 60 mph
were over the San Joaquin Valley. The high winds produced near
blizzard conditions and snow drifts between 3 and 4 feet in the
Tehachapi Mountains.
   Rain was falling along the central and southern California coast.
   Rainfall during the six-hour period up to 1 p.m. EST included
over a half-inch at Santa Barbara, Calif., and a third of an inch at
Port Hueneme, Calif., and Port Muga Naval Air Station. Snowfall
during the same period included 4 inches at Sault St. Marie and 3
inches at Marquette.
   The new blast of arctic air dropped temperatures below zero over
North Dakota, much of Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and western
Upper Michigan. Strong northwest winds produced wind chill readings
between 30 and 40 below zero in much of the northern Plains and
upper Mississippi Valley.
   Readings were in the single digits and teens from much of the
northern and central Intermountain region across the central Plains
and middle Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes.
   The warmest temperatures were in Florida where 70s and 80s were
common.
   Low-temperature records for the date were set in Astoria, Ore.,
with 24; Boise, Idaho, minus 10; Ely, Nev., minus 22; Eugene, Ore.,
8; Klamath Falls, Ore., minus 3; Milford, Utah, minus 21; Provo,
Utah, minus 15; Richfield, Utah, below 25; Sacramento, Calif., 23;
Winnemucca, Nev., minus 21.
   It was 17 degrees in Fairbanks, Alaska, early Wednesday
afternoon, considerably warmer than the 40 to 50 below zero readings
in late January.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 12
degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo., to 85 degrees at Fort Myers,
Fla. The low in the nation Wednesday morning was minus 42 at
Gunnison.
   Thursday's forecast called for rain across much of southern and
central California with snow over mountain areas. Lake-effect snow
was expected along the eastern shores of the lower Great Lakes and
Upper Michigan.
   High temperatures were to reach the single digits over northeast
Minnesota, western Upper Michigan, southeast Idaho and portions of
Utah; the teens and 20s over much of the Intermountain region, the
central Rockies and the Plains, the upper and middle Mississippi
Valley, the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes to the northern Atlantic
Coast; the 50s and 60s over western portions of California, much of
southern Arizona, southeast Georgia, southern South Carolina and the
northern half of the Florida peninsula; the 70s across extreme
southern Arizona and the southern Florida peninsula. The remainder
of the nation was to have high temperatures in the 30s and 40s.

   The judge in Oliver North's trial on Wednesday
denied a Justice Department demand for more stringent controls over
any state secrets the former national security council aide might
try to use in his defense.
   Before he ruled, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell invited the
Justice Department to take its demand to the U.S. Court of Appeals.
David Runkel, a Justice Department spokesman, said after the Gesell
ruling that the decision would be appealed.
   Earlier in the day, the department brought North's Iran-Contra
trial to a temporary halt by demanding a court order that North
``disclose no classified information in any form'' except with the
approval of the court and the Justice Department.
   Gesell was angry over the delay on the eve of opening arguments
and said jury selection would resume Thursday.
   ``I want to do my level best to protect the national secrets of
this country,'' Gesell told Deputy Assistant Attorney General
Stephen A. Saltzburg. ``I want to do even more to give this man a
fair trial. This is not a trial of national security; it's a trial
of Oliver North.''
   At issue is a Jan. 19 order in which Gesell outlined what
classified information North will be allowed to present in his
defense in open court.
   U.S. intelligence agencies have indicated worry that portions of
the order are too broad and would allow North to introduce secrets
that could harm national security.
   ``You can't ride this horse in both directions,'' the judge said.
``You can either move to protect national security or you can move
to a fair trial. Congress says that if push comes to shove, a trial
judge has one option, to move toward a fair trial.''
   The Justice Department said in a motion filed Wednesday that
North, a former National Security Council aide, ``has made no effort
to assist the court in dealing responsibly with classified
information.''
   The department said North has provided ``totally useless or at
best minimally informative'' notices of the documents he wants to
disclose.
   When the matter came up, Gesell had just finished qualifying 35
women and 10 men to be on the panel from which the jury will be
chosen. He sent the prospective jurors home and held an afternoon
hearing in the unusual situation that confronted him _ the Justice
Department stepping into an area the independent counsel previously
had handled.
   ``For a month I asked the attorney general to these hearings and
he never came,'' Gesell told Saltzburg. ``Now you come to the
conclusion that we start at square one all over.''
   Specifically, the department asked Gesell to forbid North
disclose any classified information to which it had any objection.
The proposed order would also say that Gesell must rule any
classified information was relevant and admissible before it could
be brought before the jury.
   In court, the judge said he wasn't going to tolerate a ``cuckoo
clock trial'' which would be constantly interrupted with reviews of
classified material before it is introduced in the courtroom.
   ``We have no wish to impose a cuckoo clock trial,'' responded
Saltzburg. ``We have an obligation to protect'' classified material
that could harm national security and ``there is some information
that cannot be put back in a bottle.'' He said having jurors sit
through such interminable delays ``is not a trial. That is a farce.''
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh opposed the Justice Department
request, telling the judge, ``We're ready to go to trial and we
don't want delays.'' He said he trusted North attorney Brendan
Sullivan not to ``trick or trap this court at the expense of
national security.''
   The department said in its written motion that ``At this stage,
the United States faces a trial at which important classified
information is at risk ... there is every reason to believe that
irrelevant or immaterial classified information might be revealed
during the trial.''
   The case of North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel attached to
the National Security Council who is charged with 12 criminal counts
stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, is being prosecuted not by the
Justice Department but by lawyers who work for Walsh.
   The argument is only the latest in a long legal trail over the
secrets North says he must disclose to adequately defend himself
against charges that he concealed from Congress his efforts on
behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and of covering up from the
attorney general the National Security Council's role in diverting
money from the Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   Two major charges, conspiracy and theft, were dropped last month
after the Reagan administration said it could not declassify
documents that Gesell had ruled would be needed for North to get a
fair trial on those counts.
   The department said in its motion that Gesell has issued only
``general guidance'' on the relevance and admissibility of secret
information so ``the parties are left to their own devices to
determine in opening statements, direct examination, and
cross-examination as to what classified information to mention.''
   It also said the 1980 Classified Information Procedures Act set
guidelines to permit prosecutions to go forward, but ``the
procedures adopted by the court ... fail to implement the most
important features of CIPA.'' He said, ``Additional procedures are
required.''
   Gesell disclosed in court that he had been holding a request from
North's lawyers not to apply that law in the case, waiting for
developments. Now, he said, if the appeals court goes along with the
Justice Department ``my strong inclination would be not to apply
CIPA at all.''
   Under the act, the attorney general may file an affidavit
objecting to disclosure of classified material and the court must
then order that the defendant not disclose the information.
   The judge said he was a layman in national security matters and
would leave decisions on what would breach security to the
government.
   ``I'm going to stay out of your turf, but I am not ready to let
you run mine,'' he told Saltzburg. ``I'm going to have a fair trial
or we won't have a trial.''

<HEAD>Central Bank Moves to Recover Funds Funneled To Officials Of Ousted
Goverment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Central Bank tightened control over
withdrawals by some government agencies Wednesday, apparently to
recover funds diverted before the ouster of President Alfredo
Stroessner.
   Stroessner, toppled last week in a military coup led by Gen.
Andres Rodriguez, was accused Tuesday of personally controlling at
least two accounts funded by public money.
   The Central Bank, Paraguay's equivalent of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board, said the reason for the measure was ``to obtain
better control and greater clarification of the destination, and
correct application, of public funds.''
   It said the action could cause delays in the payment of some
government checks but that the withdrawal control would last ``a
short time.'' It did not elaborate.
   In separate developments, the ex-director of the post office,
Manuel Esquivel, shot and wounded himself in the head in an apparent
suicide attempt after the new government announced an investigation
of the post office, newspapers reported Wednesday.
   Education Minister Dionisio Gonzalez Torres said teachers no
longer will be required to be members of the ruling Colorado Party
as a condition of employment. During the nearly 35-year Stroessner
regime, which came to an end Friday, all public employees were
required to belong to the party.
   Stroessner, 76, reportedly ailing, was sent Sunday into exile in
neighboring Brazil.
   Gen. Juan Antonio Caceres, minister of public works and
communications until Rodriguez took over as provisional president
and fired the Cabinet, said Tuesday that Stroesner had personal
signature power over two accounts totaling more than $4 million. The
money came from highway tolls and gasoline taxes.
   Caceres said he didn't know what Stroessner used the money for,
but he said the funds generally were not available for use by his
ministry.
   Charges of personal corruption under Stroesser during his nearly
35 years in power were widespread. Opposition politicians,
persecuted under Stroessner but now allowed to speak freely, have
called for the creation of a special commission to recover
government money that was misallocated under the old regime.
   Aldo Zuccolillo, publisher of the newspaper ABC Color, closed by
Stroessner but now prepared to reopen, supported the Central Bank
action.
   ``This was taxpayers' money being administered as though it were
a personal checking account,'' Zuccolillo said in an interview.
``There must be dozens more accounts like this linked to other
government ministries in state-run companies.''
   The publisher said he had no proof that such was the case but
expected the Central Bank review of withdrawals will reveal some.
   In other developments, attorney Pedro Abilio Rolon has filed a
citizens' suit with the Supreme Court against three ex-government
ministers and Stroessner's longtime personal secretary, Mario Abdo
Benitez.
   The suit filed Monday accused the four of using public funds and
accepting bribes to obtain mansions, apartments, and autos worth
much more than they could afford on public salaries; and sought to
embargo their local bank accounts.
   Benitez is under arrest. Among the three others, ex-Interior
Minister Sabino Montanaro was given a safe conduct out of the
country. Ex-Justice Minister Eugenio Jacquet and ex-Public Health
Minister Adan Godoy Jimenez were believed to be out of the country.

   Premier Ciriaco De Mita ordered the government to
give ``maximum assistance'' the the families of 137 Italian
passengers feared killed when a jetliner crashed in the Azores on
Wednesday.
   The Boeing 707, chartered from a U.S. company, crashed into a
mountain while approaching Santa Maria airport in the Portuguese
mid-Atlantic island chain. All 144 people aboard, including seven
American crew, were believed dead.
   The plane was bound from Bergamo, Italy, to the Dominican
Republic.
   President Francesco Cossiga, on an official visit to Mozambique,
called Interior Minister Antonio Gava and asked him to express his
condolences to the familes of the victims, the Italian news agency
ANSA said.
   The government said it was sending an air force plane to the
scene with military doctors, nurses, Red Cross volunteers and
firefighters to help recover bodies and to offer assistance to the
Portugese.
   ANSA said Italy also offered to help in the crash investigation
and was dispatching invesigative magistrate Andrea Vardaro of Rome
on the air force plane.
   During evening news broadcasts, Italian television stations gave
telephone numbers provided by the Foreign Ministry for people to
call for information about the fatal flight.
   A travel agent for Flamingo International Travel Consultant,
which organized the trip, said some of the passengers were travel
agents going to check out tourist facilities on the Caribbean
island. The agent would not give her name.
   Most of the other Italians on board were tourists from northern
Italy, according to ANSA.

   Senators said Wednesday a first vote on John
Tower's nomination as defense secretary will be delayed nearly two
weeks while the FBI reviews allegations about his finances and
drinking, but President Bush stood by him, denouncing ``rumor and
frenzied speculation.''
   ``There are new allegations of a financial nature which are now
being checked in the Tower nomination,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
the Armed Services Committee chairman. He told reporters he could
not vote to confirm Tower until the latest charges were checked, and
said he had told Bush that.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said new allegations linked Tower to
the Pentagon procurement investigation, which has involved payments
by defense contractors for classified information regarding
lucrative military contracts.
   ``It has to do with this procurement scandal, the `Ill Wind'
thing,'' said McCain, using the Justice Department name for the
investigation. ``I ... have no independent knowledge. But I am
confident that is the case.''
   An administration official said the FBI background inquiry
focused on contributions to one of Tower's senate campaigns by a
contractor now under investigation in the Pentagon procurement fraud
investigation.
   But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, emphasized
that the FBI had found no evidence of illegal wrongdoing by Tower
and noted that politicians can't control who gives money to their
campaigns.
   Tower has denied trading secrets for cash. But Nunn and other
senators have voiced concern whether Tower could avoid conflicts of
interests in view of the more than $1 million he received as a
consultant for major defense contractors after ending a 24-year
career in the Senate four years ago.
   Bush told reporters at the White House he had seen no evidence
causing him to lose confidence in his nominee.
   ``Have I seen anything, or has anything in the FBI report made me
want to change my mind as one who would be concerned about
insobriety or about failure to be ready for duty 24 hours a day? The
answer is, `No, I have not.'
   ``If somebody has something other than rumor and frenzied
speculation, please get it to the FBI or get it to the White House
staff, or certainly get it to the committee in the Senate. But let
us be fair enough that we do not deal in rumor after rumor,'' Bush
said.
   Meanwhile, White House counsel and chief ethics adviser C. Boyden
Gray presented the FBI report to Nunn and Sen. John Warner of
Virginia, the Senate panel's ranking Republican. The White House
said it was ``standard practice'' for the White House counsel's
office to ``carry such reports to the hill.''
   But it also appeared to be a move to appease Nunn, who on Tuesday
had expressed irritation that the White House had briefed committee
Republicans and not him.
   Nunn and Warner met on Capitol Hill with Gray for two hours to
review the investigation into Tower's private life.
   Gray told them a separate investigation into Tower's financial
dealings would take another 10 days to complete, Nunn said.
   After the meeting, Nunn and Warner met with Tower in Nunn's
office for 90 minutes. Tower left without speaking with reporters.
Nunn and Warner described it as a ``good meeting'' but declined
further comment.
   The administration had been pushing for a vote this week, but
dropped that after Nunn and Warner met with Bush on Tuesday.
   ``I told the president frankly that I have serious concerns, and
I also stated that if a vote was held immediately as some have
urged, I would vote no because of these concerns,'' Nunn told
reporters. The second-ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. James
Exon of Nebraska, also said he could not vote in favor of Tower
until the FBI completes its investigation.
   The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, said that
all members of that body wanted to thoroughly review an Armed
Services Committee report on the investigation, and therefore, ``I
don't see how it is possible to bring the matter to a vote this
week.''
   The Senate begins a week-long recess Friday, and the committee
must act on the nomination before it even reaches the full Senate.
Both McCain and Exon said the committee could not vote by Friday.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
main new allegation ``relates to Senator Tower's activities while he
was in the Senate.''
   ``They really can't vote until this matter is checked out,'' he
said.
   Senate Republicans generally defended the nominee.
   Their leader, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, said he spoke with Tower
on the telephone Wednesday morning and found him ``upbeat about the
nomination.''
   ``He is aware of the new allegation,'' said Dole, adding that
Tower thinks his nomination should be confirmed and ``is hanging in
there.''
   A Republican on the committee, William Cohen of Maine, said
Democrats should not allow the Tower nomination to turn into a
``partisan wrangle.''
   Committee members had hoped to vote last week, but postponed it
because of renewed allegations of heavy drinking and womanizing.
   Nunn said the committee had not received the FBI report on those
matters, although the White House orally briefed the panel's
Republicans on them Tuesday.
   Another matter also cropped up.
   Two FBI agents were reviewing documents obtained by Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., pertaining to alleged security violations at the
arms control delegation office in Geneva, Switzerland, according to
a congressional source. Tower was the chief arms control negotiator
in Geneva in 1985-1986.
   The source said Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, contacted the FBI about the State Department
documents. The agents followed up Dingell's offer on Wednesday.
   Nunn cautioned reporters to ``be very cautious'' on that issue
and added: ``We have found nothing to corroborate any security
violations by Senator Tower in Geneva.''
   Nunn, asked by reporters whether Tower's alcohol consumption was
his chief concern, said:
   ``I don't want to categorize it like that. That's one of my
primary concerns. The question there is whether there has been an
alcohol abuse problem. If there has been a problem in the past, is
there a point where it has been recognized by the nominee and dealt
with effectively? That is to say, is it a continuing problem? I do
not have an answer to that yet.''
   Tower visited the White House for a regularly scheduled breakfast
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft, said Fitzwater. Bush did not attend.

   The White House has been guilty of ``confusion
and incompetence'' in some of its handling of the troubled
nomination of John Tower as secretary of defense, President Bush's
spokesman said Wednesday.
   The unusually candid admission came as new allegations were
raised about Tower, in addition to earlier reports of womanizing and
excessive drinking. On Capitol Hill, a confirmation vote on Tower's
nomination was pushed back at least 10 days as lawmakers said they
were examining reports about Tower's finances.
   Bush, himself, said he may have contributed to the controversy
about Tower by holding a news conference where new allegations were
raised. ``This frenzied air of speculation doesn't help anybody,''
Bush said. ``It doesn't help national security or our country. It
doesn't help Sen. Tower.''
   The president, making an exception to his rule of not answering
questions during photo-taking sessions, gave a ringing defense of
Tower, praising ``the integrity and honor of a decent man.''
   Bush said ``there's always some other allegation'' about Tower.
``To my knowledge, each one of them has been reviewed and shot down
in flames. So what's fair, what's fair in the American process?
That's the question I would rhetorically ask in defense of my
nominee.''
   Meanwhile, Marlin Fitzwater, the president's press secretary,
said the White House had erred in failing to give Congress a file
requested weeks ago in connection with Tower's nomination.
   The document, from the Office of Personnel Management, deals with
an Air Force investigation of security violations at the arms
control agency in Geneva, said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. Tower was
an arms negotiator in Geneva in Geneva in 1985 and 1986.
   ``It should have been given to them right off the bat and it was
not,'' Fitzwater said. Asked why it was withheld, he said, ``I don't
have a good reason, really other than at first they didn't think it
existed, then they thought there was only part of it (that) was
there. I think it was just bad communication and just mishandling,
frankly in the first days of the administration.''
   Pressed on the matter, Fitzwater said, ``I don't have any answer.
As near as I can tell, it was just confusion and incompetence _ not
conspiracy.''
   Moreover, Fitzwater acknowledged the White House had blundered by
excluding Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, from a Capitol Hill briefing Tuesday about what the FBI
had learned in its investigation of Tower. The meeting was attended
only by Republicans.
   ``I don't know why it was decided to do it that way yesterday
morning,'' Fitzwater said. ``Obviously, I don't believe we'd do it
that way again.''
   Nunn, an influential lawmaker on issues of national security, did
not hide his unhappiness about being excluded.
   Fitzwater also acknowledged that as the White House spokesman, he
had been kept in the dark about Nunn telling Bush at a meeting
Tuesday night that Nunn could not vote for Tower if he had to vote
immediately.
   Fitzwater had told reporters Tuesday night that Nunn had not
expressed concerns about Tower during the session with the
president. ``I wasn't in the meeting and...I think there's room for
debate over how you interpret `concern,''' Fitzwater said.
   The press secretary said White House chief of staff John Sununu
had been in the meeting and ``was my source.''
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. James Exon of Nebraska, the second-ranking
Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, expressed irritation about
the way White House counsel C. Boyden Gray was providing information
to Congress.
   ``Several of us (in the Senate) have decided that we do not want
sanitized versions of the FBI report passed to us through anybody at
the White House,'' Exon said.
   ``Rightly or wrongly, a process has developed where we heard of
charges, we would funnel those to the White House, they would funnel
that to the FBI, they would come back ... to us,'' Exon said. ``We
decided that we did not need the White House as an intervening
interpreter, either asking the questions or giving us their
impression of the FBI report.
   ``I happen to feel,'' Exon said, ``that the president has not
been adequately advised on this matter by his subordinates at the
White House.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Gray's handling of documents about
Tower ``raises questions about the White House counsel's commitment
to discovering and sharing with the Senate all the facts which are
relevant to this confirmation process.''

<HEAD>Actor Sues Parents, Former Business Adviser</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Diff'rent Strokes'' star Gary
Coleman, who turned 21 Wednesday, is suing his parents and former
business adviser, claiming they got too much profit from his
financial success.
   The suit, filed Tuesday in Santa Monica Superior Court, alleges
that Anita DeThomas, W.G. Coleman and Edmonia Sue Coleman diverted
to themselves profits and assets earned by Coleman.
   The actor also claimed that Ms. DeThomas and his parents caused
his assets to be managed and invested unwisely.
   Coleman, who started his acting career when he was 5 years old,
portrayed the character Arnold Jackson on ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' a
television series designed for him in 1978. He also appeared in
several movies, including ``The Kid from Left Field,'' ``On the
Right Track'' and ``Playing With Fire.''
   Born with a defective kidney, Coleman has undergone two
transplants.
   His suit did not specify what compensation he was seeking. It did
state, however, that Ms. DeThomas got more than the 5 percent she
was entitled to as his business adviser and his parents more than
the 20 percent they should have received as his personal managers.
   Coleman said in the suit that he believed his parents were unduly
influenced by Ms. DeThomas.
   Coleman's ``Diff'rent Strokes'' co-star, Todd Bridges, 23, has
pleaded innocent to a charge of attempted murder in connection with
a shooting Feb. 2. in what police described as a drug-related
assault.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Hears Abortion Arguments Over Comatose Woman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The husband of a pregnant, comatose woman pleaded
with a state appeals court Wednesday to allow him to end his wife's
pregnancy in hopes of helping her recover.
   Martin Klein was granted guardianship of his wife Tuesday so he
could authorize an abortion, but two anti-abortion activists
appealed the ruling.
   ``I implore this court not to permit these two strangers to delay
my decision,'' Klein said in an affidavit submitted to the appeals
court prior to Wednesday's hearing.
   ``For nine years, my wife and I have lived a happy and devoted
life together,'' he continued. ``I know her wishes and priorities,
including her own survival and recovery in view of the welfare of
our 3-year-old daughter.''
   The five-judge appeals panel is expected to rule by Friday.
   Nancy Klein, who is about 17 weeks pregnant, has been in a coma
at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset since a Dec. 13 car
accident. Doctors have told her husband an abortion could aid in her
recovery.
   Klein sought guardianship when hospital officials said they would
not perform an abortion unless he became his wife's legal guardian.
   ``I just want to get this issue behind us. They're ripping my
guts out,'' said an anguished Klein before heading into the court
hearing.
   The anti-abortion activists, John Short of Farmingdale and John
Broderick of Syosset succeeded in blocking the guardianship ruling,
and Short on Wednesday said he would seek further appeals if
necessary. Short and Broderick want to be named guardians of Mrs.
Klein.
   ``At least the fetus is one day older. If we keep it going, she
will be a newborn, alive child,'' said Short, founder of the Long
Island Right-to-Life group. ``If Nancy Klein dies and the baby
lives, she will have an extension of herself in the baby.''
   Klein's attorney, Sidney Schutz, argued that Short and Broderick
were ``intruders, strangers'' with no right to decide Mrs. Klein's
fate. Mary Spaulding, Short's attorney, said it was a conflict of
interest for Klein to be named guardian.
   In an interview with The Associated Press before Wednesday's
hearing, Klein said he knows better what choice his wife would make
than the strangers trying to usurp his guardianship.
   ``Everyone has a right to their beliefs, but why don't they ever
talk about my wife, and about her life?'' he said.
   He said he visits his comatose wife in her hospital room and
tells ``her about friends who have called. I tell her about our
daughter, and just generally about how my day went.''
   He said he's not sure if his wife can understand him, and added:
``I'm just taking one day at a time. Inside, I'm tearing up, but I'm
trying to keep a smile on my face. Hopefully, everything will work
out.''

<HEAD>Two American Scientists Win Japan Prize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard University organic chemist who
was awarded the lucrative Japan Prize for 1989 on Wednesday received
his doctorate at the age of 22 and was a full professor of chemistry
by the age of 27.
   Elias J. Corey, a leader in the development of bio-organic
substances used for therapy, was chosen for the $387,600 award for
his work in synthesizing prostaglandins _ key regulatory substances
in the body.
   Corey, 71, was one of two American scientists who won the 1989
prizes. The other was a University of California-Irvine professor,
F. Sherwood Rowland, 61, who has led the campaign to protect the
earth's ozone layer.
   The awards, considered Japan's version of the Nobel Prize, were
announced in Tokyo Wednesday by the prize foundation and will be
presented April 12. They are given for scientific achievements
contributing to world peace and prosperity.
   ``This prize is an unequaled honor for several reasons, not the
least of which is the extraordinary quality of scientific research
in Japan in fields such as my own,'' Corey said in a statement
released through Harvard. ``I am appreciative and delighted both to
receive the Japan Prize and to be so connected with the country.''
Corey was the winner in this year's medical science category.
   Rowland was the first scientist to point out the mechanisms by
which chlorofluorocarbons could destroy the ozone layer, which
protects life on earth from harmful ultraviolet solar radiation,
prize officials said. He won for environmental science and
technology.
   ``I am deeply honored to be selected to receive the 1989 Japan
Prize and know that the honor really extends to the many colleagues,
including several from Japan, representing 20 countries, who have
worked with me on problems in global atmospheric chemistry,''
Rowland said in a statement.
   Much of Rowland's work has been done in cooperation with Mario
Molina at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   Corey was the first researcher to synthesize pure prostaglandins
in a natural, optically active form, allowing large-scale production
of natural prostaglandins to provide a stable supply for other
researchers, officials said.
   Prostaglandins are hormones or hormonelike substances that may be
involved in control of blood pressure and other important body
processes. Corey won in the field of medical science.
   Kisaburo Yokota, chairman of the prize foundation, told a news
conference the recipients were selected from 407 candidates
recommended from 44 countries. The 26-member selection committee is
headed by Takashi Mukaido, acting chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission of Japan.
   The foundation, a non-profit organization established under the
direction of the prime minister's office, selects two science and
technology fields each year for its awards. Next year's fields are
the technology of integration and earth science, officials said.
   The foundation was set up with a fund of 25 billion yen ($194
million) contributed by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and the
company's founder and executive adviser, Konosuke Matsushita.
   Fifteen scientists, including nine Americans, have previously won
the 5-year-old prize.
   After earning his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Corey taught at the University of Illinois from 1951 to
1959. He became a full professor of chemistry in 1956 at the age of
27. He has been Sheldon Emery Professor of Chemistry at Harvard
since 1965.

   A father poured gasoline over himself and
his two children, then set them ablaze, according to investigators
who found all three bodies in the man's locked truck.
   ``I certainly think it was deliberately set,'' said Deputy George
McKay, an arson investigator for the Rankin County sheriff's
department. ``Someone poured the gasoline on them. ... I would have
to say the adult poured the gasoline.''
   McKay said investigators also were looking into the possibility
that the children were slain before the father pulled into the
parking lot of Woman's Hospital in Flowood, where his ex-wife was
working.
   ``I don't know anybody's children who wouldn't scream and holler
... if someone was rendering these children helpless. Someone would
have heard them scream. There are people in this parking lot all the
time and on the road,'' he said. ``We feel they had met their demise
before they ever came to this parking lot.''
   Lt. Johnny Watkins, a criminal investigator with the Flowood
Police Department, said the ex-wife reported the couple hadn't been
arguing.
   ``They had spoken earlier in the day but there was nothing
indicating what was ahead,'' Watkins said. ``He was not violent on
the phone and there was nothing out of the ordinary.''
   County Coroner Jimmy Roberts identified the dead as 29-year-old
Benny Bilbrew; his son, Benny Carl Bilbrew, 6, and his daughter,
Fecia Bilbrew, 5, all of nearby Jackson. Bilbrew was a self-employed
concrete worker.
   Watkins said there were no witnesses to the 12:30 p.m. fire and
that Bilbrew and the childen died immediately.
   McKay said hospital personnel noticed the fire only after the
explosion of some shotgun shells sitting in the burning truck. He
said no gun was found in the truck, although a knife was recovered.
He also said no gasoline container was recovered.
   The children's mother, Connie Bilbrew, was at work in the
hospital cafeteria when the fire occurred. Watkins said she had to
be sedated after being told of the deaths. He said she wouldn't be
questioned at length until Friday at the earliest.
   However, he said Mrs. Bilbrew indicated in a brief interview
immediately after the fire that the couple had divorced about two
years ago, but had lived together for about a year until they split
up again a few weeks ago.
   Watkins said Mrs. Bilbrew had custody of the children, but she
said they had been visiting their father since Monday because an ice
storm had closed schools this week.
   Hospital Administrator Tom Fitz said the explosion didn't damage
the hospital and the incident didn't disrupt services.
   But he said, ``People are really upset here. It's been really
emotional.''

<HEAD>Kinsey Board Calls For Outside Review Of Troubled Sex Research Institute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kinsey Institute's board of trustees
gave a vote of confidence to its besieged director Wednesday and
called for an outside review of the sex research conducted during
her tenure.
   The trustees said a review conducted last year by a faculty
committee was flawed and had misled university administrators, who
called for the resignation of the institute's director, June
Reinisch, in December.
   In a statement, the trustees said the new review would be
conducted by a panel of experts not affiliated with Indiana
University, which houses and partially funds the 40-year-old
institute.
   The previous review had presented no evidence to substantiate
charges made against Reinisch by anonymous accusers, the board said.
Those charges included that Reinisch has managed the institute
poorly and failed to conduct enough research during her six years
there.
   ``Unfortunately, these charges have been accepted by the internal
review committee as true, and they appear to have misled university
administrators about the quality of her contribution,'' the
statement said.
   The board said Reinisch may have made errors of administrative
judgment and offended some institute workers, but ``while these
faults are serious, they are not worthy of public censure.''
   The second review will deal only with testimony on the quality of
the research conducted during Reinisch's tenure.
   Reinisch, who is president of the 10-member board of trustees,
said she had nothing to do with writing the statement, and did not
vote on whether to release it.
   ``Obviously, I am very relieved to have a public statement from
my board of trustees,'' she said.
   ``If there's going to be an outside review, I hope that it will
be done as quickly as possible, since we've been through a very long
period of turmoil and it will be another period of uncertainty,''
Reinisch said.
   The trustees noted that university regulations require a second
review by outsiders, but none had been commissioned.
   The statement recognized Reinisch's ``many achievements,''
including bringing more recognition to the institute and starting
programs to help the public with sex information.
   Although the board said there ``might have been more research
produced'' during Reinisch's tenure, they cited a negative climate
in federal support, the time-consuming nature of revitalizing ``a
moribund organization'' and the distractions of accusations made
against her.
   Since her arrival at Kinsey, Reinisch has brought in more than
$3.4 million.
   A spokeswoman for Morton Lowengrub, dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences and the official who called for Reinisch's resignation,
said Lowengrub would have no comment on the trustees' statement.

<HEAD>Khomeini Pardons Iranian Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has pardoned
political prisoners in Iran in a general amnesty declared during
celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution,
Tehran Radio announced Wednesday.
   Neither the state radio nor the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, both monitored in Nicosia, specified how many prisoners
would be freed or when the amnesty would take effect.
   The state radio said Khomeini proclaimed the amnesty at the
request of Intelligence Minister Mohammad Rey-Shahri, who said in a
letter to the revolutionary patriarch that the political groups ``no
longer constitute a threat to the revolution.''
   The radio said all but 900 prisoners jailed for belonging to
outlawed opposition groups will be freed under the amnesty.
   The 900 ``have been directly involved in crimes,'' Rey-Shahri
said.
   Iran's main opposition group, the Iraqi-based Mujahedeen Khalq,
had said 140,000 dissidents were arrested in recent years as
Khomeini's Islamic Revolution consolidated its grip on power after
overthrowing the monarchy in 1979.
   Rey-Shahri, a hardliner and son-in-law of President Ali Khamenei,
told Khomeini he ``proposes all imprisoned members of the grouplets
be pardoned ... regardless of the judicial stage of their cases,''
IRNA reported.
   It quoted Khomeini as agreeing and hoping authorities will treat
the pardoned prisoners ``kindly and in a brotherly manner and would
encourage them by providing them with employment facilities.''
   Khomeini's latest amnesty followed a wave of executions in which
hundreds of political prisoners and captured anti-Khomeini activists
have been reported slain.
   The executions have taken place despite signs that Tehran is
moving toward easing political, social and religious restrictions
after the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war with Iraq.
   The government has said it will allow political parties to form,
provided they do not conspire against the state.
   The mujahedeen have said claimed more than 12,000 Iranians have
been executed since August.
   In a statement Wednesday, the mujahedeen called the amnesty a
trick to gain support and called on the United Nations to verify
amnesty releases.
   ``Khomeini finds himself in dire need of an amnesty claim on the
eve of the 10th anniversary of his faltering rule,'' said the
statement. ``There is nothing but demagogery and deceit to this
ploy.''
   The London-based Amnesty International, which monitors human
rights worldwide, said last week that it knows of more than 1,500
executions in that period.
   The U.S. State Department also criticized human rights abuses in
Iran in a report issued Tuesday.
   ``Stories of torture in Iran's prisons are rampant and cover''
mock executions, threats of sexual abuse and floggings, the report
said.
   Last month, Khomeini announced that thousands of prisoners who
had served one-third of their sentences would be freed during the
10th anniversary celebrations, which end Saturday. Hundreds have
already been released.
   That amnesty, apparently aimed primarily at common criminals
rather than political prisoners, did not include prisoners serving
life terms, sentenced to death, drug smugglers, spies and hard-core
opponents of Khomeini's regime.
   Khomeini also suspended executions of drug smugglers during the
10-day anniversary celebrations.
   At least 132 alleged drug traffickers were publicly hanged last
month amid a ferocious anti-narcotics campaign, which includes a new
law mandating death for anyone found possessing even small
quantities of drugs.

<TEXT>
   ``Amos 'n' Andy,'' pulled from the CBS
schedule 25 years ago after protests about its portrayal of blacks,
could be heading for Broadway thanks to a decision by a federal
appeals court.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, overturning a lower court,
ruled that CBS did not have blanket trademark rights to the show and
its characters. And a playwright who brought the action five years
ago said Wednesday he still has plans for his proposed musical based
on ``Amos 'n' Andy.''
   ``I'm going ahead,'' said Stephen Silverman, author of the
musical, ``Fresh Air Taxi.'' ``I've rewritten the script and now I'm
looking for a producer.''
   The ruling Monday allows Silverman or anyone else to use Amos
Jones, Andy Brown, Algonquin J. Calhoun, the Kingfish and any other
characters connected with the show before 1948, as well as such
phrases from the show as ``Holy Mack'rel,'' ``Ain't dat sumpin'' and
``Scuse me for protrudin.''
   George Schweitzer, senior vice-president of communications for
CBS, said the network was ``reviewing the option'' of taking the
case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The comedy series featuring the black characters was introduced
on radio in the 1920s, with the roles played by whites.
   The show came to television on CBS in 1951 and were played by
blacks. CBS had purchased all the rights to the characters in 1948
from Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, the white actors who
created the characters on radio.
   Silverman, a former newspaper columnist who wrote the recent
``The Fox that Got Away'' and an upcoming biography on director
David Lean, conceived of the musical in 1981.
   The name was based on the cab company in the show owned by the
title characters.
   Silverman contends he tried to contact CBS about use of the
characters but was continually rebuffed and ignored.
   He argued that CBS had abandoned its trademarks by not using the
characters since the show was pulled off the air in 1964 due to
protests about the portrayal of blacks.
   The litigation began in 1984. In August 1987, District Judge
Gerard Goettel ruled that although CBS had not used the properties
or revealed plans for any use, it had shown that it wanted to hold
the option.
   But the three-judge appeals panel said that at the time the issue
came to court, the Amos 'n' Andy trademarks had not been used for 21
years.
   Despite the reasonable explanation CBS gave for not using ``Amos
'n' Andy,'' the judges found that the trademark cannot be protected
if use was discontinued for more than 20 years and there were ``no
plans to use or permit its use in the foreseeable future. A bare
assertion of possible future use is not enough.''
   However, the judges upheld the network's rights to all scripts
produced after 1948 and said no determination on infringement could
be made until the play is produced.
   Silverman may use aspects of the ``Amos 'n' Andy'' materials
``including names, stories, and characters to the extent that such
elements of expression are contained ... in the pre-1948 radio
scripts, which are in the public domain,'' the judges said.
   Court papers showed commitments topping $500,000, including
enlisting jazz star Jabbo Smith to write the music and Vernal
Bagheris, the director of ``One Mo' Time,'' to direct.

   A Jewish settler was burned to death Wednesday
when a firebomb struck his car in the occupied West Bank, the army
said. Three Palestinians were reported killed by army gunfire, and a
fourth was slain in a prison riot.
   The surge of violence came a day after the U.S. State Department
issued a report alleging the Israeli army's handling of the 14-month
Palestinian uprising ``led to a substantial increase in human rights
violations'' in the occupied territories.
   Wednesday's deaths raised to at least 378 the number of
Palestinians killed since the uprising began against Israeli rule in
the occupied territories. The Jewish settler was the 16th Israeli to
die.
   The firebomb struck the man's Peugeot near the West Bank
settlement of Alfe Menashe, a Jewish enclave close to the Arab
village of Qalqilya, the army said.
   Israel radio quoted an Alfe Menashe resident as saying: ``The
auto was caught in traffic and ... a firebomb was thrown at the car.
No one left the car.''
   But the radio later said a preliminary police investigation
revealed no evidence of a firebombing, such as a broken bottle or
shattered glass, though the car was badly burned.
   The radio said police have doubts the car was firebombed, but
gave no details on how the car caught fire. An army spokesman,
speaking anonymously in line with army regulations, said the car did
not crash and that a report on the incident would be released
Thursday.
   The driver, 38-year-old Albert Jerassi, who also lived at the
settlement, was killed, the radio said.
   Settlers tried to converge on the scene, but army soldiers
ordered them away, the radio said. The army also clamped curfews on
three nearby Arab villages, apparently to aid searches for the
attackers and to keep settlers from rampages.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told reporters: ``For the third
time, I think, people have been burned alive inside our country by
these rioters. ... Everybody should understand that we cannot stand
against this with empty hands.''
   On Oct. 31, a mother her three young children died in a firebomb
attack near the biblical West Bank town of Jericho. A soldier who
attempted to save the family later died of complications from smoke
inhalation.
   In April 1987 a Jewish woman from Alfe Menashe died in a firebomb
attack on her car in the same area. Her son died later of wounds.
   Hundreds of inmates rioted Wedesday inside the military prison at
Megiddo, in northern Israel, after officials halted visitations
because relatives outside were throwing stones and raising banned
Palestinian flags, army officials said on condition of anonymity.
   Prison director Col. Yehuda Saran told Israel Radio the mood in
the prison became tense, stones were thrown at guards and some
inmates tried to escape over fences.
   ``They (guards) first opened fire with rubber bullets, and then
opened fire with live ammunition when the prisoners began to try to
escape and there was serious danger,'' Saran said.
   Israel radio said the dead prisoner, whose name was not released,
was from the West Bank town of Tulkarem and had been shot in the
lower back.
   However, an army spokesman said, ``he was not killed by an army
bullet but had his skull broken.'' He said the army was
investigating.
   Israel Radio estimated 1,300 people were involved in the fracas.
Army sources said they included 150-200 Palestinian families outside
the gates.
   Saran told Israel radio he does not believe the incident was
sparked by the State Department charges. ``Our treatment is very
humanitarian, and I don't think the riot has anything to do with the
report,'' he said.
   Israel's Foreign Ministry defended army activities in a 15-page
response, saying troops are forced to act because of
``PLO-affiliated or Islamic fundamentalist radicals who have used
massive stone barrages, firebombs, and even firearms against Jews
and Arabs.''
   The army confirmed two Palestinians were fatally shot in
stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank. They
were identified as Jamal Salim Zakarni, 17, who was shot in the
stomach, and Banam Gradat, 18, who died of a chest wound.
   Arab hospital sources said an unidentified 20-year-old
Palestinian died from a plastic bullet wound to the head, suffered a
day earlier in a clash in the Gaza Strip.
   Merchants closed most shops and businesses in the occupied
territories Wednesday in response to a strike call from the
Palestine Liberation Organization-backed leadership of the uprising.
A strike also was scheduled for Thursday to mark the start of the
15th month of revolt.

   Five Central American nations that have
signed a regional peace accord asked the United Nations on Wednesday
to send inspectors to verify that none of their countries supports
subversion against a neighbor.
   Foreign Ministry officials from Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala,
El Salvador and Costa Rica asked U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar to send West German, Spanish and Canadian inspectors to
their nations.
   They also asked that Latin Americans be included in the
inspection team.
   ``All the people who participate in this process will be military
(observers), but they are not going to be armed,'' said Foreign
Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto of Costa Rica.
   ``It will not be a large group of soldiers; they are just
observers.''
   Perez de Cuellar, who met Central American Foreign Ministry
officials on Wednesday, told reporters he is considering sending
military observers.
   The Central American proposal, submitted in a letter in Spanish
on Wednesday to the U.N. chief, breathes new life into the peace
plan initiated by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who received
the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in 1987.
   Plans for the force have already been drafted, U.N. officials
said on condition of anonymity, and Spain, Canada and West Germany
have agreed to contribute observers.
   A joint U.N.-Organization of American States team that went to
Central America in 1987 recommended unarmed civilian inspectors,
possibly backed with military advisers, and the ministers' letter
urged Perez de Cuellar to rely on its recommendations.
   Honduras, a key U.S. ally where the Contras have bases to launch
raids into neighboring Nicaragua, blocked the 1987 plan by refusing
to allow inspections of military sites.
   Now Honduras has backed the plan. Some observers say Honduras is
afraid the presence of the Contras will prompt Nicaragua's superior
forces to cross into Honduras.
   The United States has accused Nicaragua of aiding leftist rebels
fighting a U.S.-backed government in El Salvador.
   In their letter, the Central American Foreign Ministry officials
specified that the inspectors would make sure no country harbors
rebels fighting another government or aids an insurrection in
another country.
   The U.S. Mission to the United Nations will not comment on such a
force until after the latest round of talks end Thursday, said
Helene Mahoney, a U.S. spokeswoman.
   Wilfredo Montalvan, one of seven directors of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, an umbrella group of rebels, said in Miami on Wednesday,
``The position of the secretary-general is incomplete. . .. It
doesn't to any good to send military groups to the Nicaraguan border
when people inside the country are rebelling against aggression.''
   He said the United States should also try to ensure the
democratization of Nicaragua and not just check on rebels at the
borders.
   ``We are at this time readying a new peace plan that includes
disarming the Nicaraguan Resistance, but only when there is proof of
democracy inside Nicaragua,'' Montalvan said.
   He said that peace plan will be ready by Sunday.
   The foreign ministers of the five nations reached basic agreement
on the inspection plan when they met for presidential inaugurations
in Mexico in December and Venezuela last week.
   West Germany would have to send civilian observers because its
constitution prohibits sending military forces abroad, said a West
German diplomat on condition of anonymity.
   The presidents of the five Central American nations are to hold a
two-day summit in El Salvador beginning Monday.

   The director of a U.S.-Soviet cultural exchange
group denied federal charges Wednesday that he tried to conceal
money provided by a Soviet organization the FBI has called a
Communist Party front.
   Alan Thomson, 57, accused the FBI of scare tactics in making the
criminal charges and said the agency falsely described his
organization, the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, as
a pro-Soviet propaganda group.
   ``What's behind this is an accusation of espionage that they
don't dare make,'' said Thomson. ``Because they can't. They know
there's no basis.''
   Thomson was arrested Tuesday on an indictment charging that he
tried to evade bank reporting requirements on $17,000 he received in
Moscow from the USSR Society for Friendship and Cultural Relations
with Foreign Countries.
   The FBI has said the society directs activities of Thomson's
group and in turn is run by the Soviet Communist Party to distribute
``disinformation,'' or propaganda meant to enhance the Soviet
Union's image.
   Thomson called that ``nonsense,'' saying his group was a
non-partisan, independent organization involved in U.S.-Soviet
visitor exchanges. ``We have no political line,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   He refused to discuss the criminal charges, but denied wrongdoing.
   Thomson said his group has an agreement with the USSR Friendship
Society under which the groups send each other tourists and
exhibits. He said he did not know if the Communist Party runs the
society, but called that FBI charge ``scare language'' that could
neither be proved nor disproved.
   Such charges ``are part of the operation that goes way, way back
that anybody who doesn't agree with the administration must be
sinister,'' Thomson said. ``They're trying to put a scare into the
peace movement.''
   The indictment alleged that Thomson had the $17,000 deposited in
a Buffalo bank in two transactions each under $10,000, evading the
requirement that the government be notified of transactions of
$10,000 or more.
   He was released after his arrest on a $100,000 personal
recognizance bond. The charges carry a maximum of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. charter jet carrying
Italian vacationers to the Caribbean crashed into a fog-shrouded
mountain in the Azores while trying to land on Wednesday. All 144
people aboard were believed killed.
   The 20-year-old Boeing 707, with a seven-member American crew,
was about 24 miles northeast of Santa Maria airport when it hit
1,794-foot Pico Alto mountain and burst into flames.
   Associated Press photographer Fernando Ricardo said bodies were
spread out over a wide area at the crash site in the center of the
island.
   Witnesses told Ricardo they saw the plane hit a lower slope, then
bounce over a road, lose an engine, and crash into the mountain at
1:40 p.m. (9:40 a.m. EST).
   The jet, which had a history of service problems, was bound from
Italy to the Dominican Republic, with a refueling stop in Santa
Maria.
   ``The plane was very low, everything seemed perfectly normal,
then it turned and flew straight into the mountain,'' said witness
Manuel Vairos Figueredo, mayor of the fishing village of Santa
Barbara near the airport.
   ``There was a tremendous explosion. The plane burst into flames
and trees around it caught fire. Nobody could possibly have
survived,'' Vairos Figueredo said in a telephone interview with the
AP.
   Rescue workers spread out over the rugged, wooded crash site
recovered between 50 to 70 bodies by Wednesday midnight, local
officials said. Heavy fog and difficult access to the crash site
hampered rescue efforts.
   Police sealed off the site and rescue efforts were put off until
daybreak Thursday. Rescuers said they could not continue without
floodlights.
   The Portuguese Civil Protection Service, which provides rescue
services and aid in civilian emergencies, said apparently no one
aboard survived.
   Portuguese civilian aviation officials arrived on Santa Maria to
search for the plane's flight recorder. They called the island's
airport the biggest and best in the Azores and said the weather had
been fine for an emergency landing.
   Villagers had rushed to the crash site to help, Vairos Figueredo
said.
   ``It was a horrible scene, the bodies and remains of the victims
were terribly burned,'' he said. ``The village and the whole island
are in a state of shock.''
   Santa Maria is the easternmost of the nine-island Azores
archipelago in the mid-Atlantic. The crash site is about 8{ miles
from Vila do Porto, capital of the 39-square-mile island, 750 miles
west of mainland Portugal.
   The jet belonged to the U.S. airline Independent Air Corp., based
in Smyrna, Tenn., which said the plane was flying from Bergamo,
Italy, to the Dominican Republic and planned to continue empty to
Jamaica to pick up a new load of passengers. It had been chartered
by the Dominican firm Dominair by a consortium of six Italian travel
agencies.
   In Smyrna, A.L. Pittman, president of Independent Air, identified
the victims as Leon Daugherty, 41, of Nashville, Tenn., the captain;
Sammy Adcock, 36, Nashville, 1st officer; Jorge Gonzalez, 34, Rex,
Ga., the flight engineer; and flight attendants Yvette Murray, 26,
of Marietta, Ga., Angela Urban, 24, West Palm Beach, Fla., Helen
Ziegler, 45, Warner Robins, Ga., and Sabrina Cromarty, no age or
residence given.
   Portuguese TV said an anonymous caller to the newsroom claimed
responsibility for the crash on behalf of an organization called the
Brigada Terrorista International (International Terrorist Brigade).
   Police said they knew of no such group and suspected a hoax.
   The pilot radioed Santa Maria Airport control tower three minutes
before the crash but did not report anything wrong, the Portguese
news agency LUSA quoted an unidentified civil aviation official as
saying.
   The agency said the control tower then tried repeatedly to
contact the plane without success.
   Earlier unconfirmed reports said the pilot had requested a runway
be cleared for an emergency landing.
   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration reported fog in the area
with visibility of five miles below 500 feet and scattered clouds at
500 feet.
   The passengers were ``middle-income Italians flying to a sun
resort with great beaches'' on a package put together by Flamingo
Tours of Bergamo, said Pittman.
   Independent Air is 15 years old and flies 400-500 charters per
year, mostly in the Caribbean and Europe.
   In the Dominican Republic, a airport spokesman said the jet had
been due to land at 6 p.m. at the popular Punta Cana beach resort in
the eastern tip of that country. He spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   The craft was one of two Boeing 707s owned by Independent Air,
Pittman said. He said it had 12,500 cycles, or takeoffs and
landings, and fewer than 50,000 hours in the air.
   Jack Barker, a spokesman for the FAA, said that was not excessive.
   At the FAA's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City,
records show seven service difficulty reports on the plane over the
past six years, spokeswoman Bobbie Mardis said. She said they dated
from January 1983, when a report said the plane's No.2 engine was
shut down due to turbine failure.
   Tom Cole of Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle said the plane
was originally delivered to Trans World Airlines in 1968. He did not
know when Independent Air acquired it.
   The wort previous crash in Portugal occurred in November 1977,
when an airliner of the Portuguese national airlines TAP crashed at
Funchal airport on the Atlantic island of Madeira and killed 126
people. A month later an additional 36 people died when a Swiss
charter jet crashed at the same airport.

   The Food and Drug Administration has scheduled
a public hearing for early April to more closely examine the
prospects for AIDS antibody testing kits which could be used in the
home, officials said Wednesday.
   The issue of home AIDS testing has been surrounded by
controversy, and the FDA has been concerned that the tests be
accurate and that adequate counseling could be incorporated into a
home-testing system for the fatal disease.
   ``The whole Public Health Service is very much concerned that you
have a system that gives adequate results and that the results can
be explained to people,'' said Paul Parkman, director of the FDA
office that regulates the materials used in the test kits.
   ``It also has implications for behavior,'' he said. ``If people
are indulging in high-risk behavior and want to be tested, they
should have some contact with people to tell them they should not
run those risks.''
   On the other hand, the Public Health Service, of which FDA is a
part, also feels AIDS testing should be widely available, ``and
there are some people who don't want to go to the doctor and be
tested'' but would test themselves at home, he said.
   The dilemma has so far kept home-testing kits off the market.
   The FDA last April turned back requests by manufacturers who
wanted to market an AIDS test kit, and the agency said research on
such kits would have to be done in hospitals, clinics and other
traditional health care settings.
   Parkman said he knew of no manufacturers who had applied for
permission to conduct market research as restricted by the FDA.
   The FDA also said at the time it would hold a public hearing in
the future, which could lead the agency to revise its policy against
the tests.
   The hearing is scheduled for April 6.
   The kind of test that has the greatest chances of meeting with
FDA approval would allow someone to puncture a finger, extract a few
drops of blood that would be absorbed by a piece of filter paper and
send the sample to a laboratory. The same tests currently used by
doctors, hospitals and clinics would be performed on the sample to
detect the presence of AIDS antibodies.
   The person would get the results of the test by calling the lab
and giving a personal code number.
   But Public Health Service guidelines say any testing should be
accompanied by appropriate counseling, and health officials are
concerned that telephone contact may not be enough to deal with the
emotional impact of learning one has a life-threatening disease.

   An air force plane on Thursday
resumed a search for 15 missing Japanese fishermen whose trawler
caught fire in the South Pacific a week ago.
   The aerial search was called off Wednesday but was continued at
the urging of the Japanese Embassy, said External Relations director
for North Asia, Christopher Butler.
   Twenty-two ships were to continue the search even after the
aerial search was called off, said air force spokesman Doug Bray.
   Butler said the stricken vessel, the 299-ton Sankichi Maru No.
18, was sighted drifting about 400 miles west of Auckland. Rescuers
found the body of one crewmember on the ship Sunday.
   Searchers believe the rest of the crew escaped in a life raft
when the vessel caught fire Feb. 2 in the Tasman Sea about 480 miles
off northwestern New Zealand.
   The search has covered thousands of square miles of ocean and no
trace of the crew has been found, officials said. Winds of 70 mph
and heavy seas have hampered the search effort.

   A Soviet ballet troupe, lacking the financial
backing to continue its debut U.S. tour, staged a free performance
Wednesday that enticed hundreds of dance lovers to fill a wicker
suitcase with cash and checks.
   Officials still were not sure whether the Donetsk Ballet dancers
would be able to complete their 15-city tour, which originally was
scheduled to run into April.
   ``We have a meeting after this performance and we'll have to work
it out at that time,'' Lyric Opera president Robert M. Pomory said
just before intermission.
   Pomory said later that the benefit had brought in about $4,000
that will be used to provide food and shelter for the dancers.
   The troupe's financial troubles began when a group of California
and Mexican investors withdrew $200,000 last week upon learning that
dancers from well-known Soviet troupes couldn't leave the Soviet
Union to join the tour.
   Arts patrons, Pomory and the Howard Gilman Foundation of New York
responded by donating meals and cash so the dancers could be put up
in a Baltimore hotel while the tour's future was sorted out.
   Wednesday's benefit drew an enthusiastic crowd of more than 600
people who paid no admission, but were asked to donate cash to help
the tour continue.
   ``It's tragic what's happened,'' said John Talbott just after he
dropped a check in the wicker suitcase at the entrance to the Lyric
Opera House. ``A lot of America is going to miss a really exciting
classical troupe if they are not supportive.''
   Talbott and his wife, Susan, said they remembered seeing the
famed Bolshoi Ballet when it made its first U.S. tour in 1959. They
had high reviews for the Donetsk troupe, most of whom are under 25.
   ``They really are marvelous. I'm ashamed that the place is not
overflowing,'' Susan Talbott said.
   Several times during the performance, the crowd broke into
applause and shouts of ``Bravo!''
   ``I wanted to support them. I think it's important that a
community respond to a human need such as this when they're such
fine artists,'' said Martin Siegel of Columbia.
   The performance Wednesday was as much an expression of thanks by
the dancers as it was a way to raise money, Pomory said.
   ``The dancers want the people of Baltimore to know this is from
the bottom of their hearts,'' he said.
   The troupe had performances booked in Detroit, Chicago and
Columbus, Ohio. The dancers arrived in late January and their first
performance was Feb. 2 in Baltimore.
   Soviet dance star Vadim Pisarev was allowed to join the troupe
but several other well-known dancers were not, said organizer Jan
Urdzik of California-based Heart of the Art Inc.

   President Bush says he still wants some sort of
pay raise for Congress, judges and top federal officials, even
though he signed the death warrant for a 51 percent increase he
initially endorsed.
   Bush was ``inviting suggestions'' for future raise proposals at a
meeting with Republican senators Tuesday, according to Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska.
   And in a White House statement released after he signed the
resolution defeating the raise, Bush said: ``I believe that some
level of pay increase is in order, and I will be working with the
House and Senate leadership to develop proposals to achieve that
end. I would also like to express my special concern about the level
of compensation for members of our federal judiciary.''
   The House voted 380-48 Tuesday, and the Senate followed suit,
94-6, in passing legislation to reject a pay raise plan for
lawmakers, top bureaucrats and members of the federal bench.

   Americans generally don't sit still for big pay for their
legislators, although a 73 percent raise went through in Hawaii
recently with hardly a murmur. New Hampshire legislators make $100 a
year and haven't gotten a raise since 1889.
   In New Mexico, where legislators make $75 a day, they've only
gotten four raises since becomming a state in 1912, when the
compensation was $5 a day. In Rhode Island, the pay is still $5 a
day, and no one seems to know if or when there ever was a raise.
   The problem for lawmakers is summed up by Rep. Bob Brawley of
North Carolina, who tried unsuccessfully to double legislative pay
in his state from to $21,375.
   ``Everybody's going to use it for political fodder rather than
the realities of the pay scale,'' Brawley said.

   Federal officials trying to contain the
multibillion-dollar cost of the savings and loan bailout are
mobilizing more than 1,200 regulators to take control of all
remaining insolvent S&amp;Ls over the next few weeks.
   The massive government takeover was announced Tuesday as
financial regulators scrambled to implement the first portions of
President Bush's S&amp;L overhaul package.
   Meanwhile, the Bush proposals were receiving initial favorable
reactions from Congress although some lawmakers said they had
reservations about some aspects of the proposals, in particular the
$40 billion estimated cost to taxpayers.
   Officials of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
insures deposits at S&amp;Ls, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which performs the same function at banks, predicted that within a
month they would have joint regulatory teams in place at
approximately 224 insolvent S&amp;Ls.

   Advanced technology and centralization are
making the nation's energy and telecommunications networks
increasingly vulnerable to catastrophic terrorist attack, federal
investigators say.
   The government is ill-equipped to deal with such attacks, which
could be carried out with conventional weapons, or even computers,
by as few as a half-dozen assailants, a Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee investigator said Tuesday following a yearlong
investigation.
   ``In many cases, the consequences appear to be manageable; in a
few cases, the consequences are potentially catastrophic,'' Charles
C. Lane, a committee investigator, told a committee hearing.
   The Associated Press this week reported that the Energy
Department was quietly advising U.S. companies of a growing threat
of terrorist attack on vital domestic energy facilities and that it
was pressing them to fortify their defenses.

   Bribery charges against the Navajo nation's
chairman have fueled demands for his resignation, but he says he's
been targeted by Washington as ``a modern-day Geronimo'' because of
his work for Indian rights.
   Chairman Peter MacDonald Sr. also told members of the nation's
largest tribe that it was an Indian practice for a leader to accept
gifts while doing business, according to a speech released by his
staff.
   ``These kinds of acts of appreciation are a part of Navajo
culture,'' Ferlin Clark, an assistant press aide, quoted MacDonald
on Monday.
   MacDonald _ whose tribe numbers about 200,000 and lives in
Arizona, New Mexico and Utah _ has declined to talk with reporters

   Jackie Thomas desperately wishes someone
could tell her how to cope with the rare disease that forces her
4-year-old daughter to live life away from sunlight, her facial skin
to be replaced by surgery.
   Every time Wendy Thomas goes outside, she must wear a large
sunbonnet and special sunglasses that protect her delicate eyes. If
she doesn't, she runs the risk of developing more of the skin
cancers that already have marred her ever-smiling face and threaten
her life.
   Unless it is night, she must travel only in her family's van,
which is equipped with window blinds and tints. Even in the house,
she must be careful to play on the side away from what rays get past
the blinds and shades, and she must be covered every day with the
most powerful sun blocker manufactured.
   As Wendy prepared to undergo more surgery Thursday in Dallas, her
32-year-old mother said she can only wish there was a support group
in Texas for mothers of children with xeroderma pigmentosum. She
would even start one if she could find someone to join.

   Pop idol Michael Jackson's surprise visit
to an elementary school still scarred by a deranged gunman's
murderous rampage was so thrilling that one child couldn't even
remember her last name.
   ``It was kind of neat to see after what the school has
experienced,'' said Ron Teague, 36, who helped organize the
Cleveland Elementary School pupils for Jackson's lightning visit on
Tuesday. ``The children were just ecstatic, they treated him like a
brother.''
   ``I think they'll remember this for a long time,'' said Stockton
Unified School District spokesman John Klose.
   Jackson also dropped in at San Joaquin General Hospital, where
two youngsters were still being treated. The two were among 30
wounded on Jan. 17, when 26-year-old Patrick Edward Purdy returned
to his old elementary school and opened fire on the school yard with
an assault rifle, killing five children before committing suicide.

   It was not by happenstance that Charlie

of that, he became the Little Tramp, the little man facing
insurmountable odds.''
   ``Young Charlie Chaplin'' examines the early life of the comic
actor in a London slum around 1900. It will run in three parts on
``Wonderworks,'' beginning Saturday and continuing Feb. 18 and 25.
   McShane plays Charles Chaplin Sr., a second-rate song-and-dance
man who preferred women and his drinking companions to his family.
Joe Geary plays young Charlie, Twiggy is his mother, Hannah, and Lee
Whitlock is his half-brother, Sydney. The three-hour show was
originally made for British television.
   ``In real life, the father deserted the family when Charlie was
1,'' said McShane. ``We take dramatic license, and he hangs around
until he dies a horrible alcoholic death. In reality, he died of
dropsy, and he did see Charlie before he died.''
   After his death, the family is forced to move into a basement
flat. Both boys are in and out of workhouses. The mother, who was
mentally ill, spent time in asylums until Chaplin brought her to
this country in the 1920s.
   ``Our story makes a connection with the English music halls. His
mother was also a singer. She used to say to Charlie, `There's a man
passing outside. Make up a story about him.' Charlie was a very
sentimental performer because of his music-hall background. Later,
when he made talking pictures his voice was very put-on because of
that background.''
   The show also stretches credulity by suggesting that Chaplin
learned some of his most famous comic routines from his father.
   ``I get to sing and dance a little,'' said McShane. ``I do a
thing with the cane and hat. I also do a number with the finger
rolls that Chaplin did in `Gold Rush.' He stuck the forks into the
finger rolls and made them dance. It looks easy until you try it.''
   The miniseries was filmed partly on location in south London,
where Chaplin grew up. Most of it was filmed on a set built outside
of London for the ``Jack the Ripper'' miniseries starring Michael
Caine. The set was a re-creation of a turn-of-the-century London
neighborhood.
   McShane grew up in Manchester and worked in England for a number
of years before moving here. His father was a professional soccer
player for Manchester United.
   ``I never had any contact with show business until I was
influenced by a teacher in school,'' he said. ``He suggested I study
acting, and I tried out for drama school and was accepted.''
   He made his first movie, ``Wild and Willing,'' in 1962 while
still at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. In ``Jesus of
Nazareth,'' he played Judas and in ``Roots'' he was the Englishman
who won Chicken George in a cockfight. This season he was in ``War
and Remembrance'' and ``The Great Escape: The Final Chapter.''
   Currently, he is starring as director-screenwriter Don Lockwood
on CBS' ``Dallas.'' It's his first time on an American series.
   ``I'm brought in by Sue Ellen to make a movie on the life of
J.R.,'' he said. ``She buys a movie studio. I haven't had any
confrontations yet with J.R., but I think something is coming up. He
eyed me suspiciously at the wedding. He doesn't know what I'm doing
with his ex-wife.''
   McShane has starred in several series in England. In ``Gunsmith''
he was a policeman who was sent to prison and became a private
detective in Spain.

<HEAD>Sole Survivor of Heart-Liver Transplant Says She's Lucky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every day, but especially on Valentine's Day,
Stormie Jones quietly gives thanks for the historic transplant
operation five years ago that gave her a new, healthy heart and
liver, and a new, healthy life.
   ``I just think of how lucky I was because I survived the heart
and liver transplant that nobody ever had,'' Stormie said. ``I think
about how lucky I am to have a lot of friends that really, truly
mean a lot to me.''
   The first recipient of a heart-liver transplant _ and the only
one to survive _ has learned to adjust since doctors saved her life
Feb. 14, 1984.
   ``I leave all the bad things in the back of my head and I keep
all the good things in front of my head,'' the 11-year-old explained
matter-of-factly. ``So I don't have to worry about what's going to
happen later on.
   ``It's easy. All you have to do is think good thoughts. Some days
you might feel a little bit bad ... but you try to think about good
things.''
   Good things include playing basketball and climbing trees at home
in White Settlement, Texas. Bad things are returning to Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh because of complications and seeing other
sick youngsters die.
   When Stormie and her sister Misty ``were smaller, they would
pretend things would go away and things would get better,'' said
their mother, Lois Purcell. ``Misty said, `We're older now, Mom, and
we just can't do that.' ''
   Mrs. Purcell, 32, tries to think good thoughts, but it's not easy.
   ``I worry a lot. ... As she gets older, she gets more risky at
playing. Of course there's supposed to be no contact sports for
these kids anyway. Well, Stormie is so normal it's just kind of hard
to keep tabs on her.''
   Mrs. Purcell also lives with the nagging knowledge that Stormie's
immune system, at any time, could reject her transplanted heart and
liver. Those fears intensified recently when Stormie developed liver
problems that required her to return to Children's Hospital twice in
three months.
   ``I was really shocked by the whole ordeal because she had done
so well. We thought we had it made, that nothing could go wrong
now.''
   Misty, 14, took the news particularly hard. Like Stormie, she
suffers from a cholesterol problem but it's treatable by diet.
   During Stormie's monthlong hospitalization in November, surgeons
removed a bile duct obstruction. She was back in January for a week
because of elevated enzyme levels that interfered with her
anti-rejection medication.
   ``They're not tremendously serious but they're quite stressful,
probably for everyone,'' said Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who performed
the transplant. ``She doesn't need another transplant. She's fine.''
   Stormie was dying when Starzl decided in January 1984 that her
only hope would be a heart-liver transplant. She suffered from a
rare congenital disease that increased the cholesterol in her blood
to nearly 10 times normal. Because of the imbalance, caused by a
faulty liver, she had suffered two heart attacks and underwent two
triple coronary bypasses and a heart-valve replacement.
   The 16-hour transplant instantly improved Stormie's chances for
life. Her dramatic progress paved the way for two more heart-liver
transplants during the next year in Pittsburgh, but both patients
died within a few days of surgery.
   ``She's proud of the fact that she made medical history,'' Mrs.
Purcell said. ``Before she wouldn't show anybody her scar. But now
she's not shy about it. She'll raise her shirt to a certain point
and say, `See.'''
   Stormie takes five types of medicine a day including
cyclosporine, a costly anti-rejection drug she will need for the
rest of her life. Her blood is tested several times a week to make
sure her organs are functioning properly. Medicine and care are
covered for the most part by insurance. Mrs. Purcell, who has
remarried since her daughter had the operation, was forced to hold a
garage sale, however, to finance their recent trip here. Friends and
neighbors are establishing funds to help cover costs, including
education.
   Because her case is unique, Stormie faces a trip to Pittsburgh
every time a potentially serious problem arises.
   ``God forbid if anything should happen to this child,'' said her
mother. ``But if they have to do it again, they will know something
and that makes us feel better. They won't have to look at the
parents and say, `We don't know.'''

<HEAD>When In Doubt, Nominate a Senator</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even in times of trouble or political
controversy about a Cabinet choice, nominating a senator _ past or
present _ usually opens a smooth, fast track to Senate confirmation.
   Not this time.
   Secretary of Defense-designate John Tower is the problem nominee
in President Bush's Cabinet class of '89, although a 24-year Senate
career has so far enabled him to withstand challenges that probably
would have undone an outsider.
   While it is evident that some among Tower's former colleagues
would have preferred a different Pentagon choice, President Bush and
his spokesmen almost surely are correct in maintaining that in a
Senate vote, he would be confirmed.
   No newly elected president has been denied confirmation of a
nominee to his first Cabinet. And the administration insists there
has been no thought of withdrawing the selection Bush announced
nearly two months ago, after a preview round of controversy.
   Tower and Louis Sullivan, the black educator nominated to head
the Department of Health and Human Services, are the last Cabinet
nominees awaiting confirmation.
   Their cases illustrate the advantages of a Senate resume.
   The Tower nomination has been delayed by investigations involving
his personal life _ women and whiskey in Texas parlance.
   That overshadowed the question of his high-priced consulting work
for defense contractors after he left the Senate in 1985. There are
no restrictions on such activities by former members of Congress as
soon as they leave office.
   Tower's consultant fees totaled more than $763,000.
   ``That's heavy bucks,'' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said Sunday.
``I think that's more of a conflict than anything with regard to his
personality.''
   Sullivan is taking unpaid leave from Morehouse University School
of Medicine in order to join the Bush Cabinet. In the process, he is
forfeiting $297,000 in sabbatical leave pay earned over 13 years as
president of the Atlanta medical school in order to avoid any
appearance of a conflict of interest.
   The school gets about $5.8 million a year through the Department
of Health and Human Services.
   That's small change in the world of defense contracts.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
told Tower he was concerned about the perception of those consultant
fees. ``I know you to be an honest person,'' he told Tower, a former
chairman. ``But I do worry about the perception.''
   The Tower confirmation hearings may also stir some worry among
other consultants about customer perceptions of their services.
Tower said he got the fees for ``enlightened guesswork,'' and for
being available when clients called.
   ``I gave them sort of academic advice on what could happen,'' he
said. ``Any number of think tanks in town could have given them more
detailed analysis.''
   That kind of candor could spoil things in the business Tower left
behind when he canceled his consultant contracts on Dec. 1, a day
after Bush aides contacted him about possible Pentagon appointment.
   Tower has said that the consultant fees would not influence his
Pentagon decisions, and he has denied that his personal habits are
out of line. He said he has no drinking problem and that a secretary
of defense must at all times be capable of exercising the duties of
his office.
   President Bush said the Senate is performing properly by looking
into every question involving Tower, even though ``The process is
taking a little longer than I would like.'' Confirmation hangups are
not customary for senators who need approval of their former
colleagues.
   That's one reason Senate names have been sent to the Senate in
times of political strain.
   After the Saturday night massacre in 1973, Richard M. Nixon
needed an attorney general to succeed Elliot L. Richardson, who quit
in defiance of White House orders to fire the special Watergate
prosecutor. Nixon chose Sen. William B. Saxbe of Ohio, who was
confirmed by the Democratic Senate with a minimum of Watergate
debate.
   In 1980, Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance resigned because he
disagreed with President Carter's attempt to rescue the American
hostages in Tehran by force. Carter chose Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of
Maine to succeed him, gaining Senate approval without refueling the
controversy.
   Former Sen. Tower brought controversy with him.

<HEAD>Tax Filing The High-Tech Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Get your tax refund fast, the high-technology way!
   That's the pitch offered by increasing numbers of tax preparers
and financial institutions trying to attract customers in the 1989
income tax filing season.
   To deliver on their promise, they use the Internal Revenue
Service's electronic filing system, through which individual returns
are filed directly by computer over telephone lines, rather than
through the mail.
   Last year 500,000 of the approximately 107 million returns
received by the IRS were filed electronically, according to Wilson
Fadley, an IRS spokesman.
   This year the service expects the number to reach 2 million.
``It's kind of a wave of the future,'' Fadley says.
   Electronic filing is available in 36 states this year through
some 4,000 IRS-approved data transmitters, including tax-preparation
firms and computer service bureaus that work with banks and other
financial institutions.
   Plans call for the system to operate nationwide next year at this
time, Fadley says.
   To find out if and where electronic filing is available in your
state, the Arthur Young Tax Guide advises inquiring at your local
IRS Taxpayer Service or the toll-free national information number
1-800-424-1040, and asking for the ``electronic filing coordinator.''
   Judging from several test calls made on a recent weekday morning,
getting through on the toll-free number may take patience and
persistence.
   Electronic filing isn't available to individuals using their own
personal computers, though it may be someday. Thus, you can expect
to have to pay someone to provide it for you, either in the form of
an explicit charge or built into a tax preparer's fee.
   For example, the Dollar Dry Dock Bank in the New York
metropolitan area charges $45.
   What are the benefits? The most tangible is faster access to your
federal tax refund _ especially if you have a large amount due you.
   But there are other pluses as well. As your return is processed
for electronic filing, any mathematical errors you may have made are
likely to be detected.
   With electronic filing, you get a confirmation from the IRS that
your return has been received.
   The IRS likes the system too, since it reduces the costs of
processing returns.
   People who owe additional taxes can't use the system as it is set
up now. If you're in this position, you're probably in no rush to
pay anyway, unless you were underwithheld in 1988 by so much that
you are threatened with penalties and interest charges.
   Before you deal with a bank or other financial institution that
promotes electronic filing services, investigate all the trappings
of the arrangement.
   A bank may even offer to deposit the amount of your refund on the
spot into an account in your name.
   If this involves opening a new account, it makes sense to inquire
what sort of an account it is, what interest it will pay, and
whether there are any restrictions on withdrawing the money and
closing the account.
   Would-be electronic filers might feel leery of getting involved
in direct dealings with the IRS's computers. The process strikes
some people as the sort of high-profile activity that invites extra
scrutiny from the IRS and its auditors.
   Not so, the authorities say. The Arthur Young Tax Guide offers
the solemn assurance that ``electronic filing neither increases nor
decreases the possibility that your return will be audited.''

<HEAD>Explaining The Rise in Housing Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing prices have had a startling rise in many
sections of the country in the past decade or so, leaving analysts
still searching for the reasons why and wondering if something still
eludes their calculations.
   Popular explanations have included the rising cost of land, a
surge in the number of couples in the prime home-buying years of
ages 25 to 34, restrictive building and zoning codes, a tax code
that feeds demand and rising rents.
   Whatever the reason, the median price of existing homes has risen
from $48,700 in 1978 to $70,300 in 1983 to $85,600 in 1987 and
$88,100 in October of 1988. In August 1988 it was even higher, at
$91,400.
   An even sharper ascent can be traced for new homes, which sold
for a median price of $55,700 in l978 and $75,300 in 1983. Last year
the median price more than doubled that of a decade earlier,
reaching $118,000 at one point.
   While at least a score of additional reasons can be offered for
the ascent, one factor is sometimes overlooked. That is, bigger
(more rooms, baths, square footage) and probably better houses
(quality materials, central air-heat) are being built today. Buyers
are trading up, not just in price but in product too.
   Over a relatively short period of time these improvements can be
traced. in 1972, for example, the Census Bureau found that only 43
percent of new single-family houses had central air conditioning. In
1987 the figure was 71 per cent.
   In the same period, the percentage of houses with two or more
baths rose to 83 from 53, and those with fireplaces jumped from 38
percent to 62 percent. The percentage of houses of 1,600 square feet
or more rose to 59 from 38.
   But it is over an even longer period that the improvement in
housing becomes impressively clear.
   In 1940, when the Census Bureau conducted its first housing
census, the median value of owner-occupied homes was $2,938. The
dollar was worth more then, of course, but even if you quadruple the
price to $12,000 it was low.
   Now consider some of the reasons. In that year, more than a
million pre-Civil War housing units were still occcupied. Thirty-one
percent of the nation's homes had no running water, and 45 percent
didn't have complete private plumbing. Wells, cisterns, rain barrels
and outhouses were common.
   That same census found that 14.3 million units, or less than half
of all homes, had central heat. Of the 19.8 million housing units
without central heating, about 16 million relied on stoves.
   Fewer than half the homes in that year had mechanical
refrigeration equipment, while 9.3 million homes relied on ice.
About 9.9 million used other means of cooling, such as spring
houses, or had no way to protect perishables.
   Other improvements include electricity, built-in conveniences
such as dishwashers, insulation, fire-resistant materials, patios,
pools, family rooms. And the electronic house of the future might
make these seem old-fashioned.
   Whether you believe the house of today represents true value when
compared to the old days is as much a matter of personal judgment as
of any scientific cost estimate. The comparison isn't made to
justify today's prices.
   In fact, there exists a vocal if rather small percentage of the
economic fraternity who believe too much money is going into
housing, and that the nation would be better served by investing the
funds in manufacturing instead.
   But any comparison of yesterday with today illustrates the point
_ that housing for most people in the past was something closer to
rudimentary shelter than in this day and age, when lifestyle
prevails and cost seems no obstacle.

<HEAD>Steps Being Pushed To Overcome Religious Gap In Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With public school textbooks rarely mentioning
religion, growing efforts are being made to overcome this gap in the
education of the young.
   They simply can't know about the real world ``without
understanding the intensity of religious faith throughout history,''
says Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for
Advancement of Teaching.
   But they aren't getting that understanding now, conclude an
accumulating succession of studies which say schools and their
textbooks virtually exclude information about religion.
   This ``has reduced the quality of the education we are providing
to our children,'' says Boyer, former U.S. commissioner of education.
   He is the chairman of a review board of educational experts that
is developing a one-week course for elementary and high schools on
the principles and problems of religious liberty.
   It was the second major undertaking recently to get schools to
teach about religious factors in life.
   The board was formed in cooperation with the Williamsburg Charter
Foundation, a non-partison, non-sectarian project working for a more
balanced place for religion in public life.
   ``For far too long, we've had a remarkable silence on teaching
about religion in the nation's public schools,'' says Boyer, saying
this largely stems from fear such teaching might violate the
constitutional principle of separation of church and state.
   However, the new projects emphasize adherence to that principle
and to Supreme Court decisions outlawing organized prayers or
devotions in schools.
   The irony is that those decisions, ine Court Justice Tom Clark's majority
opinion said
``one's education is not complete without a study of comparative
religion'' and the ``Bible is worthy of study for its literary and
historic qualities.''
   However, studies find, one after another, that the schools mostly
ignore the subject.
   The findings have come from strong church-state separationists
such as Americans United For Separation of Church and State and
People for the American Way, as well as from various professional
education groups.
   There is a ``glaring omission'' of religion in public school
curricula, says the nation's largest educational leadership
organization, the Assocation for Supervision of Curriculum
Development.
   It urged local schools, education agencies, textbook publishers
and educators to develop instructional materials and methods to
teach about religion in various areas such as history, literature
and political science.
   Absence of religion has led to a ``collapse and distortion of
history,'' says O.L. Davis, a professor of education at the
University of Texas on the ASCD panel.
   In addition to the new study aids being developed through the
Williamsburg Charter Foundation, a broad coalition of 14 national
educational and religious groups joined recently to issue a guide on
teaching religion in the schools.
   The guide was sent nationwide last fall to school boards and
educators.
   It suggests ways for teaching about religion that are termed
``consitutionally permissible, educationally sound and sensitive to
the beliefs of students and parents.''
   The school may ``sponsor study about religion'' and about
``various beliefs'' but not sponsor the ``practice of religion'' nor
promote ``any particular view'' of it, the guide says.
   Among educational groups sponsoring it were the American
Association of School Administrators, American Federation of
Teachers, National Education Association and the ASCD.
   Religious backers included the National Conference of Christians
and Jews, National Council of Churches, National Association of
Evangelicals, Christian Legal Society and Baptist Joint Committee on
Public Affairs.
   The Williamsburg Charter Foundation says of its project:
   ``The question of religion and education appears to be a
minefield of controversies,'' with ``resulting ignorance,
confusion'' and reluctance to deal with it.
   However, ``the present moment offers a strategic opportunity'' to
do so, since ``extreme positions and unwelcome consequences'' have
become obvious and ``a new desire for consensus is evident,'' the
foundation says.
   ``There is now a widespread belief among educators, parents and
national leaders that education without appropriate attention to the
role of religious liberty in American life is incomplete.''
   The instructional materials, called ``Living with Our Deepest
Differences,'' are being developed by a project coordinating
committee headed by Henry C. Johnson Jr. of Pennsylvania State
University.
   They are to be introduced in pilot schools this year, and offered
across the country in 1990.
   They include a teachers manual, appropriate references and
instructional materials based including historical and contemporary
documents and audio visuals for a five-lesson unit in grades five,
eight and eleven.
   Os Guinness, British-born sociologist and director of the
foundation, says that increased secularism, religious variety and
conflicts between religion and science has made the need for
teaching about it all the more important.

   Twenty-seven national Jewish organizations have
banded together to try to resolve the recurring conflict over ``who
is a Jew'' under Israel's law _ an issue presently shelved by a
coalition government.
   ``It is tempting to believe that the issue ... is behind us,''
but ``regretably, that is not the case,'' said the new Coalition for
Jewish Unity. It seeks settling the problem rather than ``merely
reacting to each crisis.''
   The coalition includes Conservative and Reform Jewish bodies, but
not the Orthodox branch, with which talks were to be pursued on
differences about Jewish conversions.
   Israel's Orthodox parties have sought legislation recognizing
only Orthodox conversions to Judaism, an effort recently stopped by
formation of the coalition government.

reversing a Court of Appeals ruling in favor of the Episcopal Church
in the U.S.A.
   In their 5-2 ruling, the justices adopted a federal legal
doctrine that applies secular law to the case. Specifically, they
granted ownership to St. John's despite a 1907 document, an
``instrument of donation,'' that placed the church building under
the ``spiritual jurisdiction'' of the national church's diocesan
bishop.

   The Institute on Religion and Democracy has
expressed ``shock and anger'' that the U.S. Immigration and

   Kent R. Hill, executive director of the interdenominational
institute, says: ``For the U.S. to go back on its commitment to
receive as refugees those who it has for years insisted be allowed
to emigrate from the Soviet Union is inconsistent and
unconscionable.''
   Similar complaints have been raised concerning many Jews. The IRS

<HEAD>Austrian Ambassador's Wife Launches Own War on Drugs</HEAD>

   Claire Hoess, wife of the Austrian ambassador,
does her share of tea-pouring at diplomatic receptions, but her real
passion lies elsewhere: she's determined to fight the war on drugs.
   ``You can't beat this problem from above ... you have to shock
the kids,'' says the English-born Mrs. Hoess, a lanky woman who
wears her blonde hair cropped short and likes to relax in jeans.
   Soon after she moved here about a year ago, Mrs. Hoess vowed
she'd do something constructive to fight drugs in a city which last
year had the highest murder rate in the country.
   Police blame much of the crime on the drug dealing that takes
place in neighborhoods just a few miles away from Mrs. Hoess'
residence.
   On a trip to New York, Mrs. Hoess visited Daytop Village, a
leading drug treatment center where former addicts performed a
gritty, improvisational play based on their experiences in the
depths of a depraved drug world.
   So impressed was Mrs. Hoess with the play, entitled, ``The
Concept,'' that she decided to bring it to Washington for two
performances.
   ``I'm not doing this as a social event,'' Mrs. Hoess said in an
interview. ``I want it to have an impact.''
   To that end, Mrs. Hoess arranged for the District of Columbia
school system to have high school seniors attend a scheduled
performance Monday at a local theater.
   Members of the diplomatic corps and other Washingtonians have
been invited to a second performance.
   ``We think it's a great idea,'' said Marilyn Tyler Brown, an
assistant school superintendent. ``The students will get to see
people who have been through a substance abuse program.''
   Mrs. Hoess' initiative is ``more unusual than typical'' in the
diplomatic circuit where some women do volunteer work, but few
launch out in their own projects, according to Phyllis Moyer,
executive director of The Hospitality and Information Service, a
non-profit group that helps foreign diplomats adjust to Washigton.
   Mrs. Hoess, who sometimes spends her free time driving around the
city to get a first-hand look at the seamier parts of town, raised
money to bring the troupe to Washington and then convinced a
hotelier to donate rooms for two nights. She even got inmates at a
local prison, the Lorton correctional complex, to print the
invitations.
   Mrs. Hoess was awakened to the drug problem in the early 1970s.
   ``I saw what was happening to the friends and their children,''
she said, citing one case in which a 12-year-old walked through a
window.
   Back in Vienna, headquarters of the U.N. narcotics bureau, Mrs.
Hoess plunged into fighting drugs on an international level. She
studied the problem and learned about the drug culture.
   Since coming to the United States, she has toured drug
rehabilitation centers in New York and Atlanta, and talked to
business leaders and bankers about devoting more money to such
facilities.
   Mrs. Hoess said she likes to be personally involved in issues.
While visiting Zaire once, she traveled to a leper colony in the
bush that had been set up by Albert Schweitzer.
   The staff wanted to give Mrs. Hoess the hands-off tour for
dignitaries, but she rejected that idea.
   ``I put on my dirty old jeans and started cleaning the floors
like the other people,'' she recalled.

<HEAD>Lonely Stretch Of Border Land Comes Alive After Dark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN YSIDRO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Each night, a flat and barren stretch
of border comes alive with the muffled sound of tires rolling north
over the baked earth. The vans and cars go lightless in the dark,
their cargoes silent and hopeful.
   The stretch of Otay Mesa is one of the areas most vulnerable to
illegal immigration along the United States' 1,950-mile border with
Mexico.
   That's why the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
enforcement arm wants a four-mile ditch dug to provide a traffic
obstruction that nature lacks.
   Border Patrol officials defend the plan as justified because
they're swamped by alien smugglers driving through the border. If it
works for them, the officials say, it can work for those bringing
drugs into country.
   But the symbolism of the barrier _ likened by a Justice
Department official to a ``buried Berlin Wall'' _ has generated a
firestorm of controversy.
   The South Bay Chapter of the Mexican American Political
Association denounced the ditch as a ``feudalistic'' approach to
international relations. The Mexican government suggests it was
deceived about what it had been told was a concrete-reinforced
drainage ditch. And San Diego officials, stung by the failure to
seek their comment on the project, are indignant.
   ``We're dealing with a very organized group of people. They're
not just mom and pop out here smuggling for the weekend,'' said Ken
Stitt of the Brown Field Border Patrol station. ``They know when our
shifts are and they'll hit us at shift changes, things like that.''
   The smugglers make $250 to $2,000 a head, depending on whether
the alien's trip began in Mexico or Central and South America, Stitt
said. With the stakes so high, alien-smugglers increasingly take
desperate measures to slip past the Border Patrol onto a network of
roads less than a quarter mile from the border.
   ``There's very little regard on the part of these drivers for the
people in their vehicles,'' he said. ``They've thrown rocks at our
agents, people have fallen out and been run over because the door
popped open. They've held up babies letting us know women and
children are in the vehicle.''
   Only a small fraction of the 1,550 known vehicle drive-throughs
in the Otay Mesa area since July 1 resulted in apprehensions.
   The $2 million ditch would be wide enough (14 feet) and deep
enough (five feet) to obstruct illegal traffic while providing a
needed drainage channel.
   U.S. immigration officials see the ditch as an innocuous way to
help regain control of the San Diego border area, where about
one-third of the 1.2 million alien apprehensions last year were made.
   Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Michael Gregg said the vast
majority of the 1988 arrests _ only two of five illegal crossers
were caught _ in the sector occurred along 10 miles from the beach
east to the base of Otay Mountain.
   ``I think the people living south of the border are going to keep
coming,'' said Alberto Ala, an undocumented worker living in a San
Diego County migrant camp. ``Mexico is a hungry country and we need
to eat. I don't think a hole in the ground can stop us. We can
always go around it.
   ``They can't build a hole from the beach of Tijuana all the way
to Brownsville, Texas, so we will find a way to cross regardless,
through the air, ocean or any other way. It doesn't matter what I
feel. Whatever the U.S. government wants to do, it does, whether it
works or not.''
   The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington
lobbying group, criticized the ditch as a halfway measure and called
for 55 miles of elaborate security fences along the U.S.-Mexico
boundary to halt what spokesman Patrick Burns called an ``onslaught
of humanity.''
   The sunken fences proposed by FAIR, which is seeking
congressional sponsorship, would cost about $3 million per mile.
They would be fronted by a slope leading to a 12-foot concrete
retainer topped by an 8-foot curving, metal fence. The group
proposed financing the barriers and other border security devices by
charging people a $2 fee to cross the border.
   Border Patrol officials view some of the FAIR proposals as
unrealistic in expense and impact on international relations.
   ``For the most part, I don't think our agents want a fortress
along the border,'' Stitt said. ``We realize that most of the people
coming across the border are doing so for one thing _ to eat. So
there's empathy there. But at the same time, we just have to have
some control.''
   ``All these proposals do is raise anti-Mexican hysteria,'' said
Al Ducheny of the Mexican American Association. ``No amount of
fences and border guards and ditches is going to resolve the illegal
immigration problem.
   ``Any reasonable person looking at these plans has to ask, `Where
does the need for security stop and our need to improve relations
with our neighbor begin?'''
   The irony of the uproar over the ditch proposal, which next will
be the subject of an environmental impact report, is that it
originated in response to Mexico's concerns over increased runoff
from Otay Mesa.
   Development has changed the land, and as warehouses, factories
and roads are built on the mesa, the paved ground on the San Diego
side can't absorb runoff. Mexico's adjacent flatlands could become a
quagmire from excess rainwater now following the land's gentle slope
toward Tijuana.
   ``The concern of the drainage was a concern Mexico broached to
us,'' in 1986, said Bob Ybarra of the U.S. Section of the
International Boundary and Water Commission in El Paso, Texas. The
commission was set up 100 years ago to carry out boundary and water
treaties requiring joint engineering work.
   ``The U.S. Section studied alternatives and we find that the
ditch is the only practical way to settle an international issue,''
Ybarra said.
   Before completion of a final review of the ditch, the U.S.
Section was told of a Border Patrol plan to build concrete barriers
in the same area to try to curb the illegal drive-throughs. Ybarra
said concrete barriers would have excacerbated drainage problems.
   He declined comment on why Mexico wasn't told of the ditch's dual
purpose.
   Mexican officials now appear noncommittal toward the project,
which some Mexican politicians see as ``unfriendly.' And the Border
Patrol admits that the premature release of the deterrent aspects
became a public relations disaster.
   ``We really had hoped it could be explained, and once people
understand what it is or at least educated to what the problem is
that it wouldn't have that connotation,'' Stitt said. ``In no way
will it resemble a Berlin Wall either in looks or in what it's going
to accomplish.
   ``This is not just a problem the Border Patrol has. It's a
problem the nation has.''

<HEAD>Queasiness Over Ex-Presidents Cashing In on Their Fame</HEAD>

   There is ample precedent for Ronald Reagan to
make millions off his memoirs but the moneymaking activity of former
presidents is still a sore subject with many Americans.
   It was, in fact, a basis for Congress' decision more than 30
years ago to grant pensions and office allowances to former
occupants of the White House.
   The idea, according to a Senate committee report issued in 1986,
was to ``ensure that former presidents can live dignified retired
lives free from the need to `commercialize' and demean their status
as elder statesmen.''
   Nevertheless, before the law was passed and since, past
presidents have profited, sometimes handsomely, from writing,
speaking and business connections.
   Presidential scholars are divided on the propriety of Reagan
receiving a reported advance of $5 million for his memoirs and a
book of speeches and signing a reported $40,000-a-speech contract
with a lecture agency.
   ``He should not make one dime for writing a book of what he did
as president, or for speaking. That's what I think,'' said political
scientist James David Barber of Duke University, a leading student
of the presidency.
   But Daniel P. Franklin, a political scientist and expert on the
presidency at Colgate University, said, ``I frankly don't see
anything wrong with President Reagan writing a book and getting some
money. We tend to hold our politicians to, in some case, unrealistic
standards.''
   ``I think what it shows is that the ex-president is still seen as
a symbol and there is an idea that in some way the symbolic nature
of the presidency is compromised just by virtue of his accepting
monetary gain,'' Franklin said.
   President Bush was asked at his first presidential news
conference, on Jan. 27, about the Reagan deals and whether he
thought it was ``appropriate to cash in on the presidency.''
   ``I don't know whether I'd call it `cashing in.' I expect every
president has written his memoirs and received money for it,'' the
president said.
   When asked whether it might not create a perception of
wrongdoing, he said, ``No, because I think there's been a long of
history of that. And I don't think it's ever been challenged as
inappropriate.''
   Bush said he had read that President Grant received $500,000 for
his memoirs at a time when ``half a million really meant something.''
   Grant, bankrupt and dying of throat cancer, wrote his memoirs of
the Civil War in his last months in the hope of providing for his
family. Eventually, his heirs received $450,000 in royalties,
although Grant did not live to enjoy any of it. His two-volume work
is considered a classic war commentary.
   ``As a matter of fact, he was a much better autobiographer than
he was a president,'' said Franklin.
   When President Truman left the White House in 1953, he wrote in
his memoirs, he turned down lucrative offers from industry, some of
them involving little work, because ``I knew that they were not
interested in hiring Harry Truman, the person, but what they wanted
to hire was the former president of the United States. I could never
lend myself to any transaction, however respectable, that would
commercialize on the prestige and the dignity of the office of the
presidency.''
   Truman did sell the rights to his memoirs to Life magazine for
$600,000.
   Nevertheless he was not a wealthy man and he answered his mail
using his own pen and paper and paid for stamps out of his own
pocket, the 1986 report of the Committee on Governmental Affairs
said.
   With Truman's experience in mind, Congress enacted legislation in
1958 giving former presidents, for the first time, pensions and an
allowance for their office expenses. Reagan gets a federal pension
of $99,500 a year and an office allowance of up to $300,000.
   Richard Nixon, after his resignation from office in 1974 in the
wake of the Watergate scandals, received an advance of more than $2
million for his memoirs plus $600,000 and a share of the profits for
a series of televised interviews with British talk show host David
Frost.
   Nixon, like Dwight Eisenhower before him, accepts no speaking
fees.
   ``He has been offered up to $100,000 for speeches, is routinely
offered between $15,000 and $20,000, and we estimate we turn down
about $675,000 worth of offers a year for speeches,'' said John H.
Taylor, the former president's administrative assistant.
   ``His position is that he at least as a former president feels
most comfortable speaking out only on substance and only when he
thinks his doing so will help the country,'' said Taylor. ``There is
no implied criticism of how others do it; I am just telling you how
President Nixon does it.''
   ``That's fascinating,'' said Duke political scientist Barber.
``Here you have the most unethical president of the 20th century who
is being more ethical than the others.''
   Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, and his wife received about $1
million for their memoirs, and Ford was paid $1 million by NBC to
appear in documentaries and be available for television interviews
over a five-year period.
   Ford also accepted offers to serve on the boards of a number of
corporations. By 1987 he was serving on eight, at fees of up to
$30,000 a year, and was a consultant to others, at fees up to
$100,000. His spokesman, Robert E. Barrett, says Ford is now cutting
back on such activity.
   Both Nixon and Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, have shunned
membership on corporate boards. Reagan's spokesman, Mark Weinberg,
said Reagan ``has not accepted any that I know of and I don't know
what plans there are in that regard.''
   Barrett defends Ford's business activities, saying, ``The
president doesn't create the opportunities. Those demands are there
as a result of where society has gone in the last 15 to 20 years ...
He is sitting there, and he's going to do some of this stuff.''
   Barrett said Ford usually gets $15,000 to $20,000 for a speech,
but might speak for as little as $7,500 in some cases such as
speaking to a group in Rancho Mirage, Calif., where he lives. Over
the years, the spokesman estimated, the average fee per speech has
been less than $12,000.
   Former President Carter received an undisclosed advance for his
memoirs, ``Keeping Faith,'' after a number of New York publishers
were invited to meet with him.
   Carter is also in emand as a speaker on college campuses, most
recently at Memphis State University last month.
   Bob Young, director of the Student Activities Council at Memphis
State, said, ``We made an offer of $10,000 and it was turned down.
Then I found out that if we would offer air transportation to and
from Georgia that that would help us out. So I counteroffered with
$10,000 plus a round trip on a private plane; one of our vice
presidents helped us get the plane donated. And he accepted the
offer.''

   Lyndon B. Johnson donated profits estimated at $1.5 million from
his memoirs, ``The Vantage Point,'' to support the LBJ library in
Austin and the LBJ School of Public Affairs, according to library
archivist Claudia Anderson. Johnson also was paid a reported
$300,000 for three hour-long interviews with CBS; Ms. Anderson said
she could not determine whether this money also went to support the
library and school.
   As for Reagan, the former film star was asked during his flight
home to California on Jan. 20 whether, with the White House behind
him, he might make any more movies. He replied, ``No, there is kind
of a lingering feeling that would look a little bit like trying to
cash in on this job that I've had.''
   Six days later, Simon &amp; Schuster announced that Reagan had signed
a contract for the two books. Terms were not disclosed, but industry
sources said the former president could easily command $5 million.
   The next day, Bernie Swain, a partner in the Washington Speakers
Bureau, said he was signing both the former president and his wife,
Nancy, to a contract making the bureau their exclusive lecture
agent. Again the terms were not announced, but sources said Reagan
should get about $40,000 a speech.
   During Senate hearings in recent years on legislation to limit
ex-presidents' office allowances, concern was expressed that staff
paid by the taxpayers could be used to help them write for profit.
   Nixon aide Taylor said, ``He has always taken pains to maintain
separate accounting and make sure that all expenses having to do
with the personnel and equipment used to assist him in his research
are paid for from his own funds.''
   Barrett, speaking for Ford, also said, ``We kept everything very
separate.''
   Stuart Applebaum, director of public relations for Bantam Books,
which published ``Keeping Faith,'' said Carter ``writes his books
himself.''
   Weinberg, asked if staff paid out of Reagan's office allowance
would be involved in preparation of his memoirs, said, ``No, nobody
here has done anything of that nature so far, and I haven't heard
any discussion of it.''

   Peering through an admittedly cloudly crystal
ball, the Bush administration hopes the departure of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan will produce a friendly non-aligned government that
logically would remain on good terms with Moscow.
   It wouldn't disturb U.S. officials either if the U.S.-armed
guerrillas absorbed some remnants of the Kabul regime into the new
government in an effort to promote unity and avert a bloody
last-ditch defense of Kabul by followers of President Najibullah.
   But the realistic prediction at the State Department is that the
rebels will try to lay siege to Kabul after the last Soviet troops
leave, while the defenders will put up a vigorous, though
short-lived, defense because prospects of amnesty are slim.
   The rebels will continue to receive U.S. arms through Pakistan,
though the flow may slacken because they have recovered a powerful
arsenal from defectors and departing Soviet troops.
   ``There could be a peaceful transfer,'' said a well-placed State
Department official. ``But I doubt it seriously.''
   Ever since the Red Army rolled into Afghanistan in December 1979,
the overriding U.S. policy objective was to force them to go home
again.
   Nearly all of the more than 100,000 troops who backed the
pro-Moscow regime in Kabul are gone. The remants are expected to
depart just before the Feb. 15 deadline set in the Geneva accords of
last April.
   The U.S. objective will soon be met. And U.S. policy is entering
a less anxious phase.
   ``It's still important to have a stable Afghanistan,'' the
official said in an interview Tuesday in which he barred use of his
name. ``We'd like it to have reasonably friendly relations with its
neighbors, first of all our good friend and ally Pakistan.''
   And the United States wishes to have friendly relations with the
new government, as well.
   At the same time, in the U.S. view, economics and geography both
point toward good Afghan relations with the Soviet Union next door.
   The Soviets buy Afghanistan's natural gas and the country is a
major trade route with Pakistan, as well.
   ``Certainly, there isn't going to be an antagonistic regime in
Kabul, although we don't see any Communist regime as prospering,''
the official said.
   But the rebels are divided between ardent Moslem fundamentalists
and less militant guerrillas who reflect the Sunni majority in
Afghanistan. The rebels are also divided on whether to rally around
the former king, Zahir Shah.
   Because of all the uncertainty, the Bush administration is mostly
enjoying the Soviet exodus and keeping its fingers crossed _ and the
weapons flowing.
   ``We don't have a clue how it will play out,'' the official
acknowledged.

<HEAD>European Drive to 1992 Unity Raises Some U.S. Agricultural Fears</HEAD>

   The 12-nation European Economic Community is
trying to transform itself into a single market by 1992, a unified
trading bloc that an Agriculture Department analyst says could mean
more trouble for American farmers.
   By the end of 1992, the EEC plans to ``perfect its internal
market and remove further obstacles to the free movement of people,
goods, services and capital between the member countries,'' says
Ernest Koenig of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   ``Although complete integration may be years away, the planned
steps in that direction may conflict with U.S. interests,'' he said.
``Tax, labor, business and investment regulations in a single
European market undoubtedly will favor (EEC) members.''
   To what extent such regulations and preferences will affect the
United States and other EEC trading partners is unknown at this time.
   The move toward an integrated Europe has not met with unanimous
approval within the bloc. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
says she can never accept a United States of Europe.
   Although Mrs. Thatcher favors removing barriers that restrict
free trade, whe wants EEC borders to remain for security reasons and
does not want a single market to lead to a monetary union with a
single currency and a central bank after 1992.
   But France, West Germany and the nine other countries say the EEC
must head for that goal if it is to compete effectively with Japan
and the United States.
   If there is uncertainty about 1992 and the years after, there is
little doubt about the position of the EEC in today's world trade.
And there is no mistaking that the 12-nation bloc _ even if has some
old aches and pains _ can flex plenty of muscle.
   According to a USDA study several years ago, the 12-member EEC
had a population of about 320 million, with 11 million employed in
agriculture in 1984. Those represented 8.9 percent of the EEC's
civilian employment.
   In the United States, with a much smaller population,
agricultural employment was 3.32 million in 1984, or 3.2 percent of
total civilian employment.
   The EEC had 9.8 million farms in 1984, averaging only 42 acres
each, compared with 2.3 million farms averaging 438 acres.
   A major complaint of U.S. trade people has involved the EEC's
protective import system and readiness to subsidize exports as a way
of getting rid of surplus production. For years, the United States
has sought freer world trade and has complained often about EEC
policies.
   One of the fears of U.S. trade experts and American producers is
that the situation may worsen instead of improve with the coming of
the 1992 plan. There would be much to lose.
   Recent trade figures speak for themselves. In the fiscal year
that ended last Sept. 30, U.S. agricultural exports totaled $35.3
billion. Of the total, shipments to EEC countries were valued at
more than $7.5 billion.
   Collectively, the EEC is the largest foreign market for American
farmers. Japan, at $7.27 billion last year, is the biggest
single-country buyer.
   Koenig, writing in a new issue of AgExporter, the successor to
Foreign Agriculture magazine, said that the United States has
encouraged EEC integration but ``has stated repeatedly its concern
for fair treatment of non-members.''
   For instance, he said, there is talk among EEC members of
requiring identical or equivalent technical and regulatory
conditions in non-member countries _ called reciprocity _ before
granting them certain benefits of free access to EEC markets.
   ``Whatever the shape of things to come, exporters who wish to
succeed in a post-1992 environment must pay close attention to
developments as they unfold,'' Koenig said.
   But the EEC's long-standing Common Agricultural Policy, which
includes support of domestically produced commodities and their
protection against foreign goods, has already determined what kind
of conditions the United States will face after 1992.
   ``Internal price supports probably will decline, but import
protection and export subsidization are likely to continue,'' Koenig
said. ``This scenario could change if the (EEC) adopts a more
market-oriented policy in consequence of the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.''
   The 1992 model EEC will not have a single sovereign government,
he said. Although the European Parliament will increase its power
slightly, it will lack the authority to interfere in a member
country's affairs. The Council of Ministers will remain the
legislative branch of the EEC, and the Commission will continue as
its executive branch.

   Whether facing down dynamiters or fighting forest
fires, the National Park Service's highest ranking woman has spent
most of her 30-year career fending off threats to America's most
precious natural resources.
   As one of 10 regional directors Lorraine Mintzmyer oversees 41
parks, including some of the ``crown jewels'' _ Glacier, Mount
Rushmore, Rocky Mountain, Grand Teton, Mesa Verde, and the mother of
them all, Yellowstone, the world's first national park.
   In the three decades it has taken the 53-year-old civil servant
to work her way up from secretary, she has survived many political
storms. But the uproar over last summer's wildfires, which burned
706,278 acres within Yellowstone and cost millions of dollars, was
one of the sorest tests in a pioneering career.
   ``Let it burn'' was the name critics gave the park's natural fire
policy, the subject now of congressional hearings in Washington,
D.C., and around the country, including one scheduled Tuesday in
Cody, Wyo.
   The Park Service's wildfire management plan, in effect in
Yellowstone since 1972, gave officials discretion in suppressing
lightning-caused fires, which usually were allowed to burn unless
they threatened life or property.
   But last summer's extraordinary drought, combined with experts'
miscalculations on just how dry Yellowstone really was, forced the
Interior Department to declare total fire suppression parkwide on
July 21. By then, however, it was too late.
   Ultimately, 25,000 firefighters struggled unsuccessfully to
contain eight major blazes in and around Yellowstone. Only an early
autumn snow brought the conflagration under control in mid-September.
   Throughout the crisis, Ms. Mintzmyer consulted almost daily with
Park Service Director William Penn Mott and Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel, along with Yellowstone Superintendent Bob Barbee.
   It was she who backed Barbee's decision to limit the use of
bulldozers to cut fire lines, a decision which angered senators and
congressmen from the region as well as hundreds of Monday morning
quarterbacks who thought the park service deliberately dragged its
feet in firefighting efforts.
   She still believes her judgment call was right.
   ``As responsible managers, we can't be defensive when our
decisions are questioned or our policies are challenged,'' she said.
``I think, over the long term, there will be a realization that the
park and the people who were fighting the fires were doing the best
they could under the circumstances.
   ``It's one thing to deal with an event like a hurricane or an
earthquake because it happens in one day and then it's done, you
clean it up, you live with it. But it's quite another thing to go
through months of it as we did.
   ``It's a test the likes of which I'd never had before.''
   She praised Barbee, who endured public ridicule and threats. ``We
know that every time we do something in Yellowstone it takes on
proportions which just do not accrue to other areas,'' said Ms.
Mintzmyer.
   ``We all get tired, regardless of what profession we're in. The
test is whether you get up the next morning and go at it again.''
   Barbee has that kind of stamina, his boss said, but he's not
alone.
   ``I have the energy of two people,'' she boasted.
   At mid-life she is an avid outdoorswoman and inveterate hiker who
tries to sneak in an outing or two in her parks when she visits them
on business. Her region covers Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, North
Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana.
   Dressed in her official olive-colored Park Service uniform, her
only flamboyance is fire-engine-red fingernails and the gold ring
she had fashioned from her distinguished service pin. The gold,
embossed circle is one of her most prized possessions.
   As only the second woman in Park Service history to be awarded
that honor, Ms. Mintzmyer was acutely conscious that she was a
trailblazer as she became the first female superintendent of a major
park, then the first woman regional director.
   ``I know that I've got to do a good job so that other ladies will
have an opportunity. If I were to falter it might be difficult for
some of my successors to overcome that,'' she said.
   Always an over-achiever, she grew up in a small Iowa town where
music dominated her life. She left a banking career and joined the
park service in 1959 after a less qualified man got the job she
wanted.
   She started out as a clerk-stenographer, became program and
budgeting officer, transferred as superintendent of Herbert Hoover
National Historic Site in Iowa, and took the helm of Buffalo
National River in Harrison, Ark., in 1977, shortly after that park
service unit was established.
   There, local people were dead set against the park and the
government's assertion of eminent domain to buy up private land.
   In a showdown over a stretch of riverbank destined to be part of
the park but still in private hands, Ms. Mintzmyer rammed through a
condemnation order as a road contractor prepared to excavate. Then,
hastily gathering a force of armed rangers from parks throughout the
South, she faced down her adversary on a hill pockmarked with holes
filled with dynamite.
   ``We had this problem of how do you get the darned stuff out of
the ground,'' recalled Ms. Mintzmyer. ``We had a 24-hour patrol to
make certain nobody got in there while the experts tried to figure
it out. I was not very popular.''
   The charges eventually were exploded one at a time ``so there
wasn't a chain reaction, just a little `poof.'''
   If she makes mistakes, Ms. Mintzmyer says, she hopes she errs on
behalf of her parks.
   ``I have a very rewarding feeling about being a public servant,
and I see myself as a leader _ when something needs some action I'm
not reluctant to get out front and do something about it.''

<HEAD>Mazda 929 Glories in Understated Luxury and Convenience</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 Mazda 929 is a study in understated luxury and
convenience.
   It's easy to see why Mazda is so proud of this, its flagship
vehicle. The 929's 3-liter V-6 _ an 18-valve, fuel-injected
powerplant that produces up to 158 horsepower at 5,500 rpm _ was
smooth and flawless with the four-speed overdrive automatic
transmission. Just touch the accelerator and you felt the car pull
itself together, and zoom, you were off.
   The trunk lid was heavy and there was a solid thud upon closing
the doors, indicative of a solid, well-built car. Inside, the
four-door sedan felt roomy. The optional leather seats were
comfortable and looked plush, yet elegant. Dashboard instruments
were arrayed impressively over two-thirds of the dash but were
clearly marked and easy to read.
   But what do you expect when you lay out $25,000? In the test car,
you could expect more. It had the optional feature that allows
changes in the way the auto rides.
   By touching a button on the center console, the driver can select
soft, sport or automatic suspensions. The soft adjustment puts front
and rear shock absorbers at the normal setting. The sport adjustment
puts them at the firm setting and automatic adjusts their firmness
according to the car's speed.
   I preferred the sport setting and found it to be a nice
compromise between some of the more punishing sport suspensions of
racier cars and the floating sensation on some bigger luxury cars.
   Overall, handling on the 929 was admirable. The car felt nimble
and maneuvered as easily as some smaller cars in tight spaces. The
test 929's transmission also could be switched from economy to power
mode when great acceleration was needed.
   This is accomplished by delaying the shifting to higher speeds
than under the economy mode. The economy mode helps on fuel economy,
however.
   Buyers also should note that the 929 ranked third last year in
having the least number of complaints from new buyers (the Toyota
Cressida and Chevrolet Nova were first and second, respectively.)
   The 1988 Initial Quality Survey, by California marketing firm
J.D. Power and Associates, noted that with the 1988-model 929 _ the
first 929 to appear in the United States _ Mazda had successfully
avoided the quality pitfalls that befall many automakers with new
models.
   I found only one, very minor flaw in the fit and finish of the
test 929. One of two metal flanges for the lid of the center storage
space kept coming out of its slot, making the lid difficult to close
fully.
   Also, because the 929 was rear-drive, it tended to fishtail a bit
on slick road conditions. Mazda said it sold 6,913 of these cars in
calendar 1987 _ the 929's first full year here _ but that rose to
more than 24,250 last year. A spokeswoman said there were no
projections for calendar 1989.
   Typical buyers are what Mazda calls middle-aged parents. Median
age is 45, 70 percent of the buyers are male and 83 percent are
married. The median annual income is $63,900, and 61 percent have
college education.
   Mazda ranked the Acura Legend and Audi cars as major competitors
to the 929 because they are similar in price and size. Because of
the newness of the 929 to the United States, Consumer Reports
magazine had no report of owner complaints.
   A final note: The 929 may not be the last word from Mazda in the
luxury market.
   The company reportedly has been studying whether to follow its
Japanese competitors, Honda, Nissan and Toyota, and bring out new
luxury, performance car products.

   Federal regulators, wasting no time in
implementing portions of President Bush's savings and loan rescue
plan, have begun taking control of more than 200 insolvent savings
and loans still operating.
   Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures
deposits at commercial banks, and the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which performs the same function for S&amp;Ls, held a
joint press conference Tuesday to announce that combined regulatory
teams from the two agencies had been put into place at four bankrupt
S&amp;Ls in Maryland, Florida, California and Texas.
   Within a month, officials said they hoped to have federal
regulatory teams in place at approximately 224 S&amp;Ls that are still
operating even though they are technically insolvent.

<HEAD>Milton Bradley Hopes New Game Will Come Up Trumps</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With an advertising slogan like ``It's not
whether you win or lose, but whether you win!'' you can bet the
product has something to do with Donald Trump.
   The billionaire property mogul has teamed with Milton Bradley,
maker of some of the country's most popular games, and on Tuesday
threw a media event in the glittering atrium of Trump Tower on
Manhattan's swank Fifth Avenue to unveil ``Trump The Game.''
   Never known for hiding his light under a bushel, Trump stood
beside a much-larger-than-life replica of the board game box cover _
emblazoned with his widely familiar likeness _ as he tossed out a
ceremonial 14-karat die.
   He drew applause from onlookers when he revealed he will donate
to charities his share of the proceeds from sales of the game, which
goes on store shelves in April for about $25.
   ``I'll do as well as I can for Milton Bradley,'' said Trump. He
named several charities, including AIDS research and helping the
homeless, as intended beneficiaries of his undisclosed portion of
the profit.
   George Ditomassi, Milton Bradley's president, declared ``This
deal is one that we truly believe is a golden opportunity for Milton
Bradley. People are obviously fascinated by Donald Trump's world of
multimillion-dollar wheeling and dealing.''
   The company, a division of the big toymaker Hasbro Inc., intends
to make marketing the Trump game its top priority this year, he
said. Milton Bradley will keep its percentage of the profit.
   Milton Bradley and Trump teamed up to develop the game, which
tries to recreate the dealmaking of high-rolling real estate
developers.
   Players advance their ``T'' tokens around the board and attempt
to outbid each other for big-ticket properties, such as luxury
hotels, glitzy casinos and airlines. Once all the real estate has
been snapped up, players cut deals attempting to control
increasingly bigger pieces of the action.
   The game comes with ``Trump cards'' that players draw as they
carry out their buying and selling fantasies and fake cash with no
denominations smaller than $10 million. No need to mention whose
picture is on the play money.
   ``Essentially, it's a much more sophisticated version of
Monopoly,'' said Trump, referring to the hugely successful Parker
Brothers game. ``I love Monopoly. I've played it all my life in many
forms.''
   Will average Americans take to ``Trump The Game?''
   Apparently, Milton Bradley is convinced of it. Lawrence I.
Bernstein, a vice president for marketing, said more money will be
spent promoting the game than on any other in the company's history.
That covers famous titles like Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders and
the The Game of Life.
   In an interview, Milton Bradley's president, Ditomassi, said that
judging by the people who have read Trump's autobiography, ``Trump:
The Art of the Deal,'' Trump has a following among people of all
backgrounds, not just millionaires.

<HEAD>Short-Term Rates Edge Above Long-Term Rates In 7-Year Switch</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A seven-year switch in the pattern of Treasury
bond yields could be a sign of declining inflation but rising
short-term interest rates, economists say.
   On Tuesday, for the first time since April 1982, short-term
interest rates rose above long-term interest rates by a widely
followed measure.
   Economists said the high short-term rates reflected the
tight-money policies of the Federal Reserve, which is trying to
wring inflation out of the economy by discouraging borrowing.
   The economy-watchers said rates on mortgages and consumer loans
could rise in the weeks ahead, but in the long run the tight money
should bring down inflation and interest rates.
   ``The ultimate message is that markets expect future inflation to
be lower than current inflation,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, chief
economist of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   Some other analysts said the switch could spell trouble, noting
that past flip-flops in short- and long-term rates often reflected
credit crunches that led to recessions.
   If banks raise their prime lending rate to cope with the squeeze
by the Fed, a whole range of consumer rates that are tied to the
prime automatically would rise. The prime rate is 10.5 percent and
many analysts predict it soon will be raised to 11 percent.
   Long-term rates are ordinarily higher than short-term rates
because investors demand higher yields in return for the risk of
keeping their money locked up for longer periods.
   But for the last year, short-term rates have been rising and
long-term rates falling, trends that culminated in Tuesday's
flip-flop.
   The rise in short-term rates has been brought about by the
Federal Reserve, which uses the higher rates to discourage
borrowing, cool off the economy and prevent inflation from getting
out of hand.
   Meanwhile, the Fed's tactics have won the confidence of
inflation-wary investors. Because they are no longer demanding such
a big premium to keep their money tied up in bonds, long-term rates
have fallen.
   The so-called inversion of the yield curve occurred Tuesday
morning. By the end of the day, the yield on the Treasury's
three-month Treasury bill was at 8.82 percent and the yield on the
benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.79 percent.
   By some other measures _ say, comparing yields on the 30-year
bond and the one-year note _ the inversion in yields had already
occurred.
   Kudlow said the inversion in yields signals a decline in
inflation that will be good for both stocks and bonds.
   Skeptics say the Federal Reserve does not have a delicate hand on
the tiller of the economy and is very likely to cause a recession by
pushing short-term rates too high.
   Since the Civil War, all 22 times the yield curve has inverted
there has been a recession or a ``growth'' recession, in which
industrial production declined, according to Raymond Dalio,
president of Bridgewater Associates in Wilton, Conn.
   Dalio said Tuesday that a flat yield curve is necessary for now
because the United States needs high short-term rates to attract
foreign money and prop up the value of the dollar. But, he said, if
the Fed overdoes the tightening, which he expects, there will be ``a
deep downturn emerging at the end of '89 or the beginning of '90.''
   The current situation perplexes money managers, who have to
decide whether to put money into short-term or long-term debt
securities, said Dale Krieger, managing director of Carnegie Hill
Asset Management in New York.
   On one hand, managers can get guaranteed annual returns of 9
percent by putting money into short-term instruments. But by doing
so they miss the chance to get in at the start of what some believe
will be a bull market in bonds brought on by declining inflation.
   Krieger said his firm's clients are playing it safe, passing up
speculation in the bond market and pulling in unusually high yields
on short-term debt. ``For us, this is a gift,'' he said.

<HEAD>Network Execs Solicit Advertisers' Support for Regulation Relaxation</HEAD>

   The three major commercial television networks
want relief from regulations limiting how much prime-time
entertainment they can produce for themselves.
   The networks, who say rising program costs have forced them to
boost their ad rates, also want to be able to invest in some of the
shows produced for them, and share in money the shows make after
completing their network run.
   The network executives disclosed Tuesday that they plan to resume
their long-running talks with Hollywood producers aimed at reaching
a compromise on those issues.
   The chief executives at the three networks _ Thomas S. Murphy of
Capital Cities-ABC Inc., Laurence A. Tisch of CBS Inc. and Robert C.
Wright of National Broadcasting Co. _ appealed for support as they
fielded questions for 90 minutes before the Association of National
Advertisers.
   The executives said rising programming costs is the main reason
they have had to boost ad rates.
   The regulation suggestion infuriated independent television
station owners, who say viewers would have fewer choices if the
networks had greater financial interests in programming.
   ``This is a naked attempt by the networks to regain their former
position of total domination of the broadcast television business,''
said Preston Padden, head of the Association of Independent
Television Stations.
   DeWitt Helm Jr., president of the Association of National
Advertisers, said an ANA committee was studying the matter.
   The network trio's appearance came as the networks' combined
share of the viewing audience has fallen due to the rise of
independent stations, cable networks, pay television and
videocassette recorders.
   Tisch said the networks' share of the prime-time viewing audience
slipped to 68 percent last year from 90 percent a decade ago, but
that he expected it would bottom out at about 64-65 percent over the
next few years.
   ABC's Murphy conceded, ``We are not as good as we once were but
we are still the best buy in town.''
   Murphy said the networks are hurt because they are limited to
producing no more than five hours of entertainment programming each
week for the 22 hours in their prime-time schedule, and cannot share
in any of the financial rewards of programs sold for reruns after
completing a network run.
   Murphy said the networks were proposing that they be allowed to
produce or have a financial interest in 11 hours of prime-time
programming a week.
   NBC's Wright said the federal restrictions tie the networks'
hands even as they must compete for programs with nearly two dozen
cable networks unconstrained by program ownership limits.
   Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America,
said the program producers have offered a compromise that would
allow the networks to own a half share in a limited number of
programs.
   Without an agreement, Valenti said the restrictions on network
ownership of programs is due to expire starting in late 1990.
   Valenti said the restrictions, in effect since 1970, have served
the consumer by encouraging the proliferation of independent
stations and program choices.
   ``The key issue is maintaining the balance of power in the
marketplace,'' he said. He declined say whether a compromise with
the networks is near.
   On other issues, the network executives were asked whether the
NBC and ABC alliances with cable in recent years amount to
consorting with the enemy.
   NBC's Wright said the cable ventures are ``a logical extension''
of what his network does. Murphy, whose company also cable
interests, said Capital Cities-ABC took that position as well.
   But CBS's Tisch said he has found ``less there than meets the
eye'' and said CBS is better off to focus all its efforts on
broadcast operations.
   Murphy and Tisch said they would be open to considering an
advertiser-produced series. But Wright said a potential problem is
the ill will created if the network cancels the series because of
poor ratings.

   European officials plan to up the ante
in a trade battle that has been brewing for weeks over stiff tariffs
imposed by the United States in retaliation for a ban on
hormone-treated meat from America.
   Officials of the 12-nation European Economic Community will press
to have the duties declared in violation of international trade
rules at a meeting today of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade in Geneva. The 96-nation GATT offers a forum for settling
trade disputes among its members.
   Meanwhile, a flurry of visits among high-level officials from the
United States and the Common Market trading bloc were scheduled in
the coming weeks, giving both sides a fresh chance to resolve the
stubborn dispute.
   Frans Andriessen, the EEC's top trading official, was scheduled
to travel to Washington Feb. 17-18 for talks with the new Bush
administration, while the community's agriculture chief, Ray
MacSharry, was planning a trip later in the month, spokesmen said
Tuesday.
   The new U.S. secretary of state, James A. Baker III, was slated
to stop in Brussels on an upcoming swing through Western Europe.
   The officials will no doubt discuss the troublesome dispute
sparked Jan. 1 when the Europeans imposed a ban on imports of meat
from cattle treated with growth hormones, a common U.S. practice.
   The United States has refused to comply with the prohibition,
which the Europeans say was drawn up for health reasons. In
retaliation for the ban, the Reagan administration set 100 percent
tariffs on European boneless beef, pork hams and shoulders and a
variety of other European products. The sanctions are worth about
$100 million.
   The trading bloc protested the retaliatory measures and filed a
complaint with GATT, saying that the ``unilateral action'' taken by
the United States ``is not compatible with GATT rules and
procedures.''
   It asked the international body ``to examine this matter and ...
make a ruling on the legal issues and recommend appropriate action.''
   GATT members could rule on the dispute at Wednesday's meeting,
but officials said such a quick decision was unlikely. They raised
the possibility that the issue could be referred to a three-member
panel for study. The panels generally take about six months to reach
a finding.
   Foreign ministers representing the EEC nations warned last month
that they would impose counterretaliatory measures on imports of
U.S. walnuts and dried fruit if the two sides failed to move quickly
to end the dispute.
   The ministers delayed implementing the sanctions to give more
time to settle the conflict. They are scheduled to meet Feb. 20 on
the matter.
   The hormone ban was set to go into effect Jan. 1, 1988, but the
EEC agreed to a one-year delay. It refused additional U.S. appeals
for postponement.
   The Europeans contend the growth stimulants pose a health risk, a
contention the United States disputes.
   The prohibition is expected to block the importation of about
$100 million worth of U.S. beef and beef byproducts.
   The disputed goods represent a small chunk of the estimated $166
billion in trade last year between the United States and the
community, whose members are: France, West Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.

   OPEC oil ministers appear to be leaning
toward holding a summit of their countries' leaders, possibly next
year to mark the 30th anniversary of the founding of the
organization, analysts say.
   Subroto, secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, said recently that key oil ministers would
discuss the proposal at a meeting scheduled for late next month in
Vienna.
   Venezuela's newly inaugurated president, Carlos Andres Perez, has
reportedly urged in recent trips to the Middle East that a summit be
held.
   In his inaugural speech last week, Perez said he had found
``receptivity to the idea of celebrating, at a convenient date, a
meeting of sovereigns and chiefs of state.''
   He said a ``meeting of OPEC chiefs of state is considered
propitious to give approval to a strategy that will orient the
organization during the 90s.''
   An OPEC summit was last held in March 1975 in Algiers.
   The oil ministers of Ecuador, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
met last week in Venezuela. Afterward, Subroto said, ``Everybody
present at the meeting expressed the need for the holding of an OPEC
summit.''
   Subroto, according to the OPEC News Agency, said the proposal
would be discussed by the eight oil ministers attending next month's
meeting in Vienna. The news agency said the ministers, members of a
monitoring committee, would discuss the time, place and theme of the
proposed gathering.
   Analysts cautioned that scheduling a high-level meeting would
raise hopes that the leaders would act to strengthen the oil market.
Failure to do so, they said, would deliver a sharp blow to the
financial markets.
   ``There's not a great deal they can do,'' said London-based
analyst Paul McDonald. ``I think it (a summit) would be about the
most disastrous thing they could do. I cannot imagine what on earth
they could find to talk about.''
   Oil prices have tended to climb in advance of recent OPEC
meetings and often tumbled afterward when expectations of strong
steps were dashed.
   Fergus MacLeod, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London,
said he doubted a meeting of the heads of state would be scheduled
this year. But he said there was a ``reasonable chance'' of one in
1990 to mark OPEC's startup.
   Bahman Karbassioun, a consultant in Vienna, agreed. ``There may
be a summit, maybe next year,'' he said.
   He said OPEC had planned a 20th anniversary summit in September
1980. But the meeting was canceled when war broke out between bitter
enemies Iran and Iraq.
   By holding a 30th anniversary gathering, MacLeod said, the heads
of state would have ``a reason to meet'' and hold down expectations
in the markets.
   The cartel was formed in September 1960 by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. It currently has 13 members.
   The officials would likely review the goals of the organization
and plot their strategy in the coming decade, analysts said.
   A 1990 summit would give the cartel time to assess the fresh push
to restore discipline among its members and the impact of the August
cease-fire between Iran and Iraq.
   At a November meeting in Vienna, the oil ministers fashioned a
new production accord in an effort to curtail their output and lift
prices. They set an overall production ceiling of 18.5 million
barrels a day for the first six months of 1989, sharply under the
levels at the end of last year.
   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly Oil
Market Report that OPEC crude production in January was 19.4 million
barrels a day, off 3.4 million barrels a day from December.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 1 oil exporter, slashed production
last month by more than 2 million barrels a day to an average of 4.5
million barrels a day, according to the newly released report.
   Crude prices have generally been rising since the output
agreement was struck, a pickup tied to optimism that the OPEC
countries intend to stick to the individual output targets set in
the accord. Prices, though, are still under the cartel's benchmark
of $18 a barrel.
   As part of the accord, the oil ministers set up the monitoring
committee to watch prices in the market and members' adherence to
their new quotas. Panel members represent Algeria, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
   Other OPEC members are Gabon, Ecuador, Libya, the United Arab
Emirates and Qatar.

<HEAD>As Insider Trading Gained Publicity, S&amp;L Crisis Languished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street's inside traders drew the attention
while a much larger financial crisis _ the disintegration of a good
part of the nation's savings and loan industry _ received little
notice, observers say.
   ``I don't think the S&amp;L crisis has gotten nearly as much
publicity, particularly in going after the crooks, as Ivan Boesky
and those types,'' said Edwin Gray, head of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board from 1983-87. ``It's almost a crime in its own right.''
   Experts said the securities fraud scandals of the 1980s pale in
comparison with the troubles in the trillion-dollar thrift industry,
which this week prompted a $90 billion plan to staunch $100 billion
in losses at hundreds of savings and loans.
   ``I think the harm has been broader in the S&amp;L problem, not from
the criminality per se but from the compounding of all the problems
and the waste of economic resources,'' Bert Ely, a financial
consultant in Alexandria, Va., said Tuesday. ``I think the Wall
Street stuff is small change.''
   But the combination of shady dealings, the allure of the stock
market and an aggressive federal prosecutor in New York combined to
overshadow _ at least in the public eye _ a scandal that may have
grown unchecked for lack of enforcement in the mid-1980s.
   President Bush's plan to rescue the savings and loan industry
includes $50 million more for the Justice Department to attack
fraud. It would deploy extra investigators on 200 cases and add
about 80 federal fraud prosecutors.
   In addition, federal regulators would be given broader powers,
civil penalties would be increased to fines of up to $1 million per
day, and criminal penalties would grow to 20 years or more in prison.
   But some officials said the plan _ which comes two years after a
stepped-up federal probe in Texas that resulted in 33 indictments _
may be too little, too late. Gray said the bank board was uncovering
fraud as early as 1983.
   While doubling the number of examiners at the board, which
regulates the nation's 3,100 thrift institutions, Gray said he was
stymied by the Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Justice
Department in pressing criminal prosecutions.
   ``There were and are a lot of crooks down there,'' said Gray, now
president of Chase Federal Bank in Miami. ``The problem is all of
this is so late. We all knew there was a problem in 1983 and '84.''
   In New York, meanwhile, then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani
actively prosecuted securities fraud cases involving characters like
Boesky, the now-jailed speculator who paid $100 million in fines and
illicit profits to answer securities charges.
   A handful of other cases _ from the arrest of a 24-year-old
inside trader to the recent record $650 million settlement with
investment giant Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. _ also have drawn wide
attention.
   In contrast with the notoriety of insider trading, the bank
board's earlier probes of S&amp;Ls often were kept quiet to avoid
creating public panic. A former bank board attorney said the board
operated under the belief it was defending the industry it was
designed to regulate.
   Hal Levi, who left the agency in 1982 after 10 years, said the
idea of giving bank board examiners greater investigative power was
shot down as early as 1972, when one official feared they would
become ``junior Dick Tracys.''
   ``Clearly I think there was an absence of prosecution of those
kinds of cases in the late '70s and early '80s, even for ones that
were referred'' to the Justice Department, he said. ``It was a
never-ending source of frustration to me.''
   Rosemary Stewart, the bank board's current enforcement director,
said the Justice Department has not had enough prosecutors to handle
the number of referred bank fraud cases.
   ``Just because a bank failed last year it's unreasonable to
expect that the owners who drove it into the ground will be in jail
this year,'' she said. ``Criminal enforcement work always follows
these problems. Certainly it's not too late.''
   Added Gray: ``You've got to put your money where your mouth is if
you want to go after these guys. They have the sharpest attorneys,
the crookedest accountants. They're slimy like snakes and they know
how to do these things.''

<HEAD>Vacuum Cleaner Maker Says It's Seeking Possible Buyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAHWAY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled Regina Co. Inc. says it
will consider bids from potential buyers.
   Malcolm L. Sherman, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Rahway-based vacuum cleaner company, said Regina would agree to be
sold, ``if people are interested and willing to pay a price that is
fair and will satisfy our stockholders.''
   Sherman said in a telephone interview Tuesday that no specific
price has been set.
   ``The company is under-financed,'' Sherman said. Regina's
recently hired consulting firm, Bear Stearns &amp; Co., ``felt that a
sale might be the best way to make it stronger,'' he said.
   There is no timetable for the sale, and the company will continue
to operate on its own if no suitable buyer is found, the chairman
said.
   ``We cannot ignore that consumer product companies are sought
after today, and that Regina has one of the historically strong
names in the consumer products market. We have asked Bear Stearns to
go forward,'' Sherman said.
   The company released a revised financial statement in early
January that showed the company's net loss for the 15-month period
ending Sept. 30, 1988, as $16.8 million on sales of $190.3 million.
   The company in September withdrew its initial financial
statements showing a $10.9 million profit on sales of $181.1 million
after calling them materially inaccurate. Peat Marwick, Main &amp; Co.
was hired to complete an audit, and at about the same time chairman
Donald D. Sheelen and Vincent P. Golden, chief financial officer,
resigned.
   Analysts say Regina's past problems were linked partly to the
quality of its Housekeeper line of vacuum cleaners, introduced about
three years ago. The company has introduced an updated version of
the Housekeeper vacuum.
   Regina is facing several shareholder lawsuits, filed in federal
court in Newark, over its financial reporting.

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp.'s board of directors is
urging company stockholders to enter a merger agreement with ConAgra
Inc. and reject overtures from Tyson Foods Inc.
   Holly Farms spokesman Ted Bailey Tuesday said the company would
mail statements to shareholders soon seeking their approval of the
ConAgra deal. The company said a stockholders meeting would be
convened as soon as possible to vote on a merger with ConAgra.
   Two-thirds of both Holly Farms' and ConAgra's shareholders would
have to endorse the merger in order for it to take place.
   The board of the Memphis-based chicken producer said ConAgra's
stock-swap offer had less strings attached than the Tyson proposal
to pay $63.50 per share for Holly Farms stock.
   ConAgra's stock trade deal has been valued at about $1.06
billion, and Tyson's $1.09 billion.
   The Holly Farms board said Tuesday that there were reasons to
doubt that a deal with Tyson could be completed.
   Plus, the board said an opinion from investment banker Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. concluded the terms of the ConAgra agreement were fair
to Holly's share owners.
   ``The company, since its board meeting of Jan. 20, had invited
Tyson and ConAgra to improve the terms of their respective
proposals,'' the Holly Farms statement said.
   ``ConAgra had made no changes. Tyson had added a condition to
theirs, and that, along with the prospect of litigation between
Tyson and ConAgra had led the board to conclude that their concerns
over the Tyson proposal were even more acute than before.''
   ConAgra, an Omaha, Neb., food and poultry processor, and Tyson,
of Springdale, Ark., have been courting Holly Farms for months.

<HEAD>British Airways Upgrades First Class Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC today introduced changes in
its first class service that it said were designed to win a bigger
share of the $1 billion market for first class passengers on
long-haul flights.
   The airline, recently privatized by the British government, said
it is investing $40 million to upgrade its first class service, from
which it earns nearly $400 million a year. The changes, detailed at
a news conference in New York, include individual passenger video
terminals at each seat.
   ``This investment is a bold and calculated bid for commercial
supremacy in an intensely competitive market,'' Sir Colin Marshall,
the airline's chief executive, said.
   ``There are no indications of major growth in the first class
market, so our objective is to take business from other airlines by
offering the highest standard of passenger service in the world.''
   In addition to the videos, other changes include redesigned cabin
interiors in first class and improvements in sleeperseats, such as
new swivel tables; improved menus that give passengers freedom to
eat when they wish; and a new wine cellar.
   The new service is scheduled to be introduced on long-haul
flights starting March 1.
   The videos, which British Airways called the world's first
individually-controlled passenger units, are located in the armrest
of the seats. The airline said it is testing two video systems in
first class service on four of its Boeing 747s.
   One system is made by Fieldtech, a British company, while the
other comes from Avicom, a subsidiary of U.S. aircraft maker
Lockheed Corp. Passengers will be able to choose a film from a
library of nearly 50 video cassettes.
   British Airways said the changes in first class service reflect
two years of research, which has shown that first class passengers
fall into two categories: the ``Patrician'' and the ``Achiever.''
   The airline said its new service is aimed mainly at top business
people from around the world, predominantly male, usually in their
late 40s and holding the position of chairman or chief executive.
   There are 18 first class seats in British Airways' cabins.

   Share prices were stronger in moderatly active
trading early today.
   Prices pushed higher from the onset of trading, buoyed by healthy
gains overnight in Tokyo and New York, traders said. They also
claimed that the market's recent shortage of stock persisted,
provoking a clamor for stock at any price.
   ``Overall, the market's moving higher on the sole reason that
there's a squeeze,'' a market maker said.
   Dealers awaited guidance from Wall Street later in the session,
to determine whether further gains were justified. If New York opens

<HEAD>Will Stock Split Attract Small Investors to GM?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. surprised automobile industry
analysts by declaring a 2-for-1 stock split designed to attract
small investors to the automaker's stock.
   Analysts were split on whether the split would work.
   Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York has been bullish
on GM's stock and thinks that small investors will head toward it
once the split takes effect March 31.
   David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York took a
different view.
   ``I wouldn't bet the ranch on it,'' he said.
   And stock analyst Deal Gulis of William C. Roney &amp; Co. of Detroit
said even with the split, which doubles the number of shares but
cuts their value in half, GM's stock prices will remain high.
   ``When it splits it will be $45 or $50 and even that is not a
prime retailing price,'' Gulis said.
   GM common stock closed Tuesday at $93.87{, up $1.37{ from the
open. GM's announcement about the split and a 20 percent dividend
increase to $1.50 a share came after the stock market closed Monday.
   GM sparked a rally among blue-chip stocks that pushed the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials up 26.07 points Tuesday to its
highest close since the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash.
   ``I think it is a big part of the rally today,'' Gulis said
Tuesday. ``It's a GM rally.''
   The dividend announcement was anticipated on Wall Street. The
split wasn't.
   ``I was expecting they would do it, especially since Ford did
it,'' automobile analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. said of GM's dividend announcement.
   On Jan. 12, Ford Motor Co. announced a 25-percent increase in its
dividend, moving it to 75 cents a share, but did not split its stock.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith said in a statement released with news of
the dividend and split that the actions would make the company's
common stock more affordable for individual investors by dropping
the per-share price.
   But some analysts questioned whether such a move would lure small
investors back to the stock market, which many have avoided since
the October 1987 crash.
   ``I think they're afraid of the market in general, it doesn't
matter what company it is,'' Heaney said.
   But Brady said he was pleasantly surprised by the dividend, its
size and the split, and thought the split would attract small
investors.
   ``They'll get another 5 (percent) to 10 percent of the people
looking at the shares just because of the split,'' Brady said.
``It's much more in line with a retail (stock) presentation than it
was at $90 a share.''
   Brady, who said the last time GM split its stock was in 1955,
said Monday's announcements were the latest in a series of good-news

   Also on Monday, GM announced it was reinstating hearing and

   Smith has said 1988 will prove to be GM's best year in history
when earnings are announced next week.

<HEAD>Pikeville Pepsi Plant May Close Despite Top Consumption Ranking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 16 years Pikeville has led the nation
in per capita consumption of Pepsi Cola, but that might not be
enough to keep the doors open at the local Pepsi bottling plant.
   Charles ``Buddy'' Boston, manager of East Kentucky Beverage Co.'s
bottling plant in Pikeville, said Monday that a decision to close
the plant might be made in several weeks after a series of meetings
with union officials
   ``Right now, it's just in the discussion stages,'' Boston said.
``No firm plans have been made and we will be negotiating with our
union on that topic later this week.''
   Boston said the company would discuss the situation with the
United Steelworkers of America, which represents some of the plant's
100 employees.
   The problem is with the plant and not with the local consumption
habits that have boosted Pikeville to the top of the nation's Pepsi
consumption standings, Boston said.
   Although the machines inside the plant north of Pikeville are
``very modern,'' they are designed to package Pepsi in returnable
bottles, Boston said.
   Times and tastes change and it's now cheaper and more convenient
for customers to use non-returnable containers such as plastic
bottles and alumnum cans, company officials said.
   Pepsi plants nearby in West Virginia and Virginia and elsewhere
in Kentucky already are equipped to produce the drink in
non-returnable containers, Boston said. But converting the Pikeville
plant to non-returnable production was still being discussed, he
said.
   Boston said he was confident of one thing regardless of the
plant's future: Pikeville will keep on drinking Pepsi whether it
comes from the local plant or from across state lines.
   ``We don't expect that to change, no matter what we do,'' he said.
   Two other eastern Kentucky cities, Hazard and Corbin, rank No. 2
and No. 3 respectively in per capita Pepsi consumption. Pepsi does
not release figures on exact volume consumed per person.

<HEAD>Airplane Makers Told to Check for Inadequately Tested Fasteners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas have been
asked to determine whether inadquately tested nuts, bolts and rivets
made by Voi-Shan Aerospace Products were used in making aircraft.
   The request stems from an investigation into reports that test
documents on the fasteners were falsified at a laboratory of the
Fairchild Industries subsidiary in Chatsworth, Calif., near Los
Angeles, Mitch Barker of the Federal Aviation Administration said
Tuesday.
   A day earlier, in discussing a weekend search of the plant, U.S.
Attorney Gene S. Anderson and others said no crashes had been linked
to the disputed parts, which investigators said were listed as
approved by a phantom ``Inspector 11.''
   Discovery of untested parts on aircraft could result in fines for
the manufacturer, Barker said.
   ``It's certainly a safety concern,'' he said. ``It's a concern to
the U.S. attorney's office, and it's a concern to us.''
   He said FAA staff in district offices had been told to work with
manufacturers to determine whether the fasteners were shipped and
whether they were used by the European consortium Airbus Industrie.
   Airlines are not being required to check their planes, Barker
said.
   ``The manufacturers will be checking and reporting back to us,''
he explained. ``They are held accountable for the parts that go into
their aircraft.''
   Fairchild's annual report said the fasteners are used on almost
every military and commercial aircraft.
   Jack Gamble of Boeing said records of Voi-Shan shipments and
parts use and distribution would be checked by company and FAA
officials, after which ``the FAA will make a determiniation about
what needs to be done.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Sony Corp. on Wednesday announced video
equipment that uses 8-millimeter tape but has the same sharpness as
the bigger Super VHS format.
   Sony said the new EV-S900 video tape recorder will be priced
$1,850 and the CCD-V900 combined camera-recorder at $1,880. Both
will be available in Japan in April and in the United States in May
or June, it said. Release in Europe is planned for later in the year.
   As with Super VHS, new 8mm Hi-Band equipment can record and play
back older 8mm tapes, but without an improvement in picture quality.
However, old equipment cannot play tapes made with the new systems.
   The 8mm Hi-Band equipment uses tapes made with a newly developed
process. The tapes will have a list price of $21 for a 120-minute
tape, or about twice the price of current 8mm tapes, Sony said.
   The 8mm video standard is widely used for home video cameras. The
system has been less popular as a home recording and playback
format, with only about 500 pre-recorded titles currently available,
Sony officials said.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Clears Major Hurdle In Partnership Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed partnership of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. with Italy's state-owned telecommunications
manufacturer has cleared a major hurdle.
   Societa Finanziaria Telefonica Stet, the state-controlled holding
company for the telecommunications industry, announced Tuesday that
it has endorsed the U.S. giant as a partner for Italtel.
   The announcement, which was widely expected, ended 14 months of
preliminary talks between Italtel and four foreign candidates for
the partnership. Siemens AG of West Germany, Alcatel NV of France
and Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson were the candidates rejected
by Italtel.
   By entering into a partnership with Italtel, AT&amp;T will gain
access to the Italian telecommunications market. SIP, the telephone
company controlled by Stet, has planned $27 billion in investments
over the next five years and Italtel is likely to mong Sip's major
suppliers for phone gear.
   A spokeswoman for Stet said the executive committee examined and
``unanimously approved Italtel's proposal to begin negotiations for
a possible global agreement with AT&amp;T.''
   The decision to enter formal talks still requires approval by the
government and Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI), the
giant industrial state holding that owns Stet.
   IRI's management board is expected to give its endorsement on
Thursday, after which the Minister of State Industry Carlo
Fracanzani will review the matter. Although Fracanzani has made it
no secret in the past that he preferred a European ally for Italtel,
he isn't expected to block the choice of AT&amp;T.
   The final form of the partnership hasn't yet been determined, but
it is expected to involve a swap of stock between the two companies.
Sources indicated that one of the advantages of AT&amp;T's proposal was
that it guaranteed the independence of Italtel.

<HEAD>National Pizza Files Suit Against Pizza Hut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Pizza Co. has filed suit in
Sedgwick County District Court against Pizza Hut, which is trying to
block National Pizza's attempt to acquire a chain of fast-seafood
restaurants.
   National Pizza, based in Pittsburg, Kan., is the largest U.S.
franchiser of Pepsico Inc.'s Pizza Hut restaurants. Its sole
business has been operating Pizza Hut franchises.
   The company last month made an unsolicited offer to buy Skipper's
Inc. for $9.25 a share, or approximately $27 million. Skipper's,
which operates 213 restaurants in the western United States and
British Columbia, has rejected the offer.
   On Monday, Pizza Hut officials advised National Pizza in a letter
that the acquisition of Skipper's would violate its franchise
agreement with Pizza Hut, said J.J. Fitzsimmons, chief financial
officer for National Pizza, which operates more than 225 restaurants.
   ``We responded asking for specifics on how it would violate the
agreement, and they declined to provide details,'' Fitzsimmons said.
   Rather than wait for Pizza Hut to respond, National Pizza went to
court on Tuesday in an effort to resolve the matter, Fitzsimmons
said.
   ``They want us to be a single-purpose franchisee. After the way
Pepsi has been growing ... they don't want us to grow,'' he said.
``We believe their interpretation of the franchise agreement is
discriminatory and unenforceable,'' he said.
   The lawsuit asks the court to rule whether the acquisition of
Skipper's would violate the franchise agreement between the two
pizza companies. A hearing to determine whether an injunction should
be issued is scheduled for Thursday.
   Roger Rydell, a spokesman at Pizza Hut's corporate headquarters
in Wichita, said a 1984 amendment signed by the two companies
``reconfirms the franchise agreement requirement that National Pizza
limit its business activities to operation of Pizza Hut system
restaurants.''
   ``We believe the proposed acquisition of Skipper's Inc. is in
direct violation of our agreements with National Pizza,'' he said.
   Gene Bicknell, chairman of the board of National Pizza Co., said
Pizza Hut is trying to manipulate National Pizza's future at the
expense of its shareholders.
   ``This investment in Skipper's by National Pizza Acquisition
Corp. will have absolutely no effect on the ability of National
Pizza Co. to continue to operate as the largest and most successful
Pizza Hut franchisee,'' Bicknell said.
   The lawsuit asks for a ruling before the Skipper's tender offer
expires on Feb. 28.

<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc. said today it
has set a deadline of noon Feb. 15 for bids for the giant textile
company, which was put up for sale by its directors last week.
   The company also announced that a special shareholders meeting to
consider a hostile takeover bid by Chicago-based Farley Inc. has
been postponed from Feb. 25 to March 2, with Farley's agreement.
   Farley spokesman Jack Albertine confirmed that his company agreed
to the delay, but he declined comment on Pepperell's bid deadline.
   Farley's latest offer for Pepperell _ $52 per share, or more than
$1.5 billion _ is set to expire at midnight Feb. 15.
   West Point-based Pepperell, the nation's largest publicly held
textile company, has been fighting Farley's takeover attempt since
it was announced in October. Farley originally offered $48 for each
of Pepperell's outstanding shares, but sweetened the offer to $52
last week.
   Pepperell's directors announced Friday that they would sell the
company, ``assuming that an acceptable proposal is received.'' The
board said it had considered Farley's new offer and decided that
``values in excess of $52 per share could be realized in a sale of
the company.''
   In early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, Pepperell
was up 37{ cents a share at $55.50.
   Pepperell spokeswoman Toni Cauble declined today to say whether
any bids other than Farley's have been received since Friday's
announcement.

<HEAD>Judge Continues Order Enjoining Tender Offer For Prime</HEAD>

   A federal judge has continued an order blocking a
California company's $970 million bid for Prime Computer Inc. shares
until more information about co-bidder Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
role is disclosed, a spokesmen for Prime said.
   Prime, which is based in Natick, said U.S. District Judge A.
David Mazzone on Tuesday continued his order until Drexel Burnham,
an investment banking firm, makes disclosures required of bidders
under federal securities laws.
   Mazzone said in December that the California bidder, MAI Basic
Four Inc., needed to make disclosures about the relationship between
Drexel and New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, who controls MAI
Basic.
   ``Like Judge Mazzone, we find Drexel Burnham Lambert's continuing
omission of the required material information concerning tender
offer bidders `inexcusable and inexplicable,''' Prime said in a
statement.
   Fred Anderson of the Tustin, Calif.-based MAI Basic said the
company has met all of the judge's requirements for lifting his
order ``except for clarification of Drexel Burnham's status as a
co-bidder.''
   ``We're going to wait until we receive the transcript on today's
hearing, and we will evaluate the transcript and then make a
determination of whether we will make the additional disclosures or
consider an appeal,'' Anderson said.
   A decision on MAI Basic's next course of action likely will be
made later this week, he said.
   MAI Basic has said that Drexel has been the primary financier for
LeBow and certain of his companies since 1986 and owns 7 percent of
MAI Basic's common stock.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Rise On Talk Of Soviet Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices were slightly higher in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors that the
Soviet Union was seeking to buy 600,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices.
   Other grain and soybean futures prices were mixed.
   A large wheat purchase by the Soviets would be the first
significant grain export business in more than two weeks.
   But analysts said the futures market had already largely
discounted the potential Soviet purchase, which would be covered by
the long-term grain agreement the Soviet Union signed with the
United States late last year.
   ``The minute they get the credit, it's automatically factored
into the prices, so this is not really a new factor in the market,''
said Cathy Leow, a grain-market analyst with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.30 a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.68 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to } cent lower with March at $2.13} a bushel; soybeans

<HEAD>Wanamaker's, Woodward &amp; Lothrop Taken Off the Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After spending five months searching for a
buyer, the owners of John Wanamaker and Woodward &amp; Lothrop have
taken the department stores off the market.
   Officials for Taubman Investment Co., a Michigan real estate
firm, said the company had decided the ``best option'' was to retain
ownership in Wanamaker and its sister company, Woodward &amp; Lothrop of
Washington, D.C. The owner said it would bring in fresh capital to
pay for modernizing the stores.
   Taubman also announced the appointment of a new chairman and
chief executive for the two department stores, Arnold H. Aronson, a
former head of Saks Fifth Avenue.
   Wanamaker and Woodies, as the Washington store is called, were
put up for sale in mid-September.
   But only a handful of bids were made, and Taubman did not
complete a proposed sale to Kevin F. Donohoe, a Philadelphia real
estate developer who emerged as the leading bidder.
   Bernard Winograd, president of Taubman Investment, said Tuesday
the company concluded ``it was our best option'' to keep the stores.
   ``I can only say ... that our thinking underwent an evolution,''
he said.
   Under a recapitalization plan that is now in the works, Winograd
said the Taubman company would invest more money into the department
stores to reduce their heavy debts. Aronson and other senior
managers at the stores also intend to buy a small ownership interest
in the stores.
   ``Much of it will be spent on the Philadelphia stores. We will
continue the renovations underway at the Philadelphia store, and we
also intend to get to the branch stores,'' Winograd said.
   ``We intend to make major capital expenditures, particularly with
Wanamaker's, which were very underspent under the previous
ownership,'' said Aronson.
   Aronson, 54, is a veteran retailer who late last year teamed with
Adler &amp; Shaykin, a New York buyout firm, to submit a bid for
Wanamaker and Woodies. He will replace Edwin K. Hoffman, 66, who has
announced his intention to retire this year after 11 years at the
helm of Woodies. The change will become effective this week.
   Taubman bought Woodies in 1984 and Wanamaker on Dec. 31, 1986.
Together, there are 32 stores with annual sales of more than $910
million. Wanamaker, a 128-year-old company, has 15 stores with sales
of about $410 million and about 6,000 employees.
   The Taubman firm, based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., is headed by
A. Alfred Taubman, who also owns Sotheby's auction house and A &amp; W
restaurants.
   Sources said Donohoe's bid fell through because his principal
financier, General Electric Capital Corp., was jittery about whether
the stores would be a secure investment in an uncertain retailing
climate.

<HEAD>Kroger Reports $119 Million Loss for 4th Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kroger Co. reported Wednesday it lost $119
million in the fourth quarter, primarily because of the supermarket
company's massive restructuring.
   Kroger said the loss contrasted to a profit of $47.4 million, or
58 cents per share, reported for the fourth quarter of 1987.
   The company's fourth-quarter sales rose to $4.28 billion from
$4.04 billion a year earlier.
   The grocery store chain undertook a $4.6 billion restructuring
last September to fend off takeover bids by Dart Group Corp. of
Landover, Md., and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. of New York.
   Under the restructuring, the company agreed to pay shareholders a
special dividend of $40 in cash for each share of common stock plus
$17 per share in securities.
   To finance the restructuring, Kroger sold some of its stores and
other assets. The company also fired about 300 of its 800 employees
at its headquarters here.
   Kroger's full-year earnings fell 81 percent to $34.5 million, or
24 cents a share, from $246.6 million, or $2.99 a share, in 1987.
   The 1987 figure included a $63.3 million one-time gain for an
accounting change.
   For all of 1988, sales totaled $17.46 billion, up from $16.37
billion in 1987.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California has displaced New York as the state
with the most multinational manufacturing companies, the Conference
Board said in a report released Wednesday.
   California now has 150 publicly owned manufacturing firms with
offices abroad, compared with 130 headquartered in New York state,
according the report by the worldwide organization of corporate
executives.
   The report is based on 1988 corporate data of the foreign
operations of 1,700 publicly held manufacturers. It said there are
990 U.S.-owned manufacturing multinationals with foreign assets of
$126 billion, up from 884 in 1987.
   In 1987, New York was home to 123 foreign-affiliated
manufacturers and California had 108.
   James Greene, an international trade specialist who compiled the
data, said the number of U.S. multinational manufacturers has fallen
from about 2,000 in the late-1970s.
   ``Since then, many have been taken over by foreign firms, others
have been merged into larger multinationals and many have been
privatized through leveraged buyouts,'' he said. ``These trends are
likely to continue through the next few years, concentrating
U.S.-owned foreign assets in fewer and fewer corporate hands.''
   New York still has more multinational firms with annual sales of
$1 billion or more _ 44 compared with California's 24 _ but
California has 66 multinationals with sales of $100 million or less,
compared with 34 in New York.
   The report said California's electronics and computer companies
have led to the increase in manufacturing multinationals, many of
which are establishing offshore production units, especially in the
Far East.
   After California and New York, Illinois had 85 multinational
manufacturers, Ohio 70, Massachusetts 61, Pennsylvania 59, New
Jersey 57, Connecticut 51, Michigan 42 and Texas 38.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former top officers of Regina Co. pleaded
guilty Wednesday to defrauding investors in the troubled vacuum
cleaner company of more than $100 million.
   Former Regina Chairman Donald D. Sheelen and former Chief
Financial Officer Vincent P. Golden told U.S. District Judge
Nicholas H. Politan they knowingly misled stockholders and the
Securities and Exchange Commission by falsifying company records.
   ``This is a case representing massive misrepresentation by the
company,'' said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. at a news
conference following the pleas. ``It represents losses well in
excess of $100 million by the investing public.''
   Alito said Sheelen instructed Golden to falsify sales by not
subtracting returned appliances from the company's income.
   In an agreement reached with Assistant U.S. Attorney Gail H.
Nichols, the two men entered guilty pleas to mail fraud and
securities fraud charges.
   Each could face five years in jail and $250,000 in fines. Alito
said restitution may also be sought.
   The company released a revised financial statement in early
January that said the company's net loss for the 15-month period
ending Sept. 30, 1988, was $16.8 million on sales of $190.3 million.
   The company in September withdrew its initial financial
statements showing a $10.9 million profit for the 12 months ended
June 30, 1988 on sales of $181.1 million after calling them
materially inaccurate.
   Peat Marwick, Main &amp; Co. was hired to complete an audit, at about
the same time resignations were offered by Sheelen and Golden.
   Sheelen, also the company's former president and chief executive
officer, owns 39.7 percent of Regina's stock.
   Regina stock plunged in value last September after the company
stunned analysts with a dour sales and earnings forecast. Regina
shares, which traded as high as $27.50 a share in August 1988,
plunged to a low of $3.75 at the time on extremely heavy volume.
   At midday Wednesday, Regina was down 62{ cents a share at $6 in
national over-the-counter trading.
   Analysts have said Regina's past problems were linked partly to
the quality of its Housekeeper line of vacuum cleaners, introduced
about three years ago.
   In 1984, Sheelen and another executive took the company private
in a leveraged buyout. The next year, Regina went public at $10.50 a
share, with a 2-for-1 stock split in 1987.
   Malcolm L. Sherman, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Rahway-based vacuum cleaner company, said Tuesday that Regina would
agree to be sold.

<TEXT>
   Despite American Airlines' recent
selection of General Electric Co. to power its fleet of new
wide-bodied planes, Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft says it remains in the
hunt to get a piece of American's widebody jet-engine business.
   American Airlines announced Tuesday it had signed an agreement
with McDonnell Douglas Co. for up to 142 planes in a deal worth an
estimated $7 million, potentially one of the biggest aircraft orders
in history.
   At the same time, American announced an agreement with GE to
acquire up to 200 CF6-80C2 engines for use on most of its widebody
jets.
   The airline agreed to acquire at least eight new MD-11 widebody
jetliners from McDonnell, with options to buy another 42.
   ``It's our understanding from American Airlines that the first
three or four MD-11 aircraft will have GE engines,'' said Robert
Weiss, a spokesman for Pratt &amp; Whitney, the East Hartford-based
subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.
   ``But American is telling us that the remaining 46 or 47 aircraft
are still open to competition and we would compete vigorously for
those aircraft with our PW4000.''
   Industry analysts agreed that American's decision to go with GE
for now was hardly a devastating blow for Pratt &amp; Whitney.
   Mark A. Bobbi, an analyst with Forecast International in Newtown,
said that after a disappointing 1987, Pratt &amp; Whitney rebounded last
year and dominated the wide-body market with its PW4000 engine. It
won 16 of 20 competitions with firm orders and options worth about
$2.5 billion.
   Bobbi noted that American is already using GE engines on most of
its widebody planes and probably stuck with GE because it wanted to
standardize its fleet.
   ``Anytime you lose a competition of this type to a competitor,
it's a blow,'' he said. ``I don't think (Pratt &amp; Whitney) really
expected to win this one.''
   Wolfgang Demisch, research director at UBS Securities in New
York, noted that American merely took options on the 200 GE
high-thrust engines, leaving the door open for Pratt &amp; Whitney to
get part of the contract in the future.
   ``For Pratt, obviously it's a disappointment that they weren't
able to regain a leading slot with American wide-bodies,'' Demisch
said.
   ``In essence, what American said is, `Not yet.' They are
basically keeping the door open,'' he said.
   American also announced that it had taken options on 100 MD-80s,
a smaller plane that is powered exclusively by Pratt's workhorse
JT8D engines. The value of the MD-80 buy to Pratt would be as much
as $750 million, analysts said.

<HEAD>Intense Racism in South African Town Creates Dilemma For U.S. Employer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOKSBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 60 years, Colgate-Palmolive
Co.'s toothpastes have helped whiten South Africans' teeth. Now, the
U.S. company wants to break ties with a town that has become a
symbol of white racism.
   A cordial corporate relationship with Boksburg, site of Colgate's
large manufacturing complex, soured in November after newly elected
right-wing town councilors decided to resegegrate parks and other
public facilities, which had been open to all races under an earlier
liberalization.
   Colgate joined other businesses in protesting the action, and
went one step further. The company has requested its property be
incorporated into the neighboring town of Benoni so it no longer
will pay taxes to Boksburg.
   The town council's actions ``are an insult to the dignity of our
non-white workers and contrary to all human rights,'' said Gerry
Nocker, Colgate's chief executive in South Africa. ``We cannot
justify the payment of rates and taxes to a town council that has
such backward views.''
   Nocker, a 47-year-old native of Scotland, said about 750 people,
70 percent of them black or mixed-race, work at the factory and pump
roughly $6 million of annual wages into the local economy.
   Officials in Benoni are studying Colgate's application. If they
formally endorse it, a final decision would be made by the
administrator of Transvaal Province.
   The Chemical Workers Industrial Union, which represents most of
Colgate's black employees, describes the company proposal as a
public relations gesture that contrasts with a ``long and difficult
relationship'' between management and workers.
   But Nocker says Colgate's opposition to South Africa's apartheid
policies extends beyond criticism of the Boksburg councilors. He
noted that the company financed a recent independent study of the
Group Areas Act which urged the abolition of laws mandating
residential segregation.
   The Boksburg controversy marks the second time this year that
Colgate, one of the biggest U.S. multinationals, has taken action
over a race-related issue outside the United States.
   In January the company said it would change the name of its
``Darkie'' toothpaste, sold by a Hong Kong subsidiary in Asia, to
``Darlie'' and substitute a picture of a grinning black minstrel on
the tube to a ``non-racially offensive silhouette.''
   At Colgate's international headquarters in New York, an executive
said the company's influential position in Boksburg has justified
the decision to stay in South Africa despite disinvestment pressure
from anti-apartheid activists. About 175 U.S. firms have pulled out
since 1983, while 138 remain.
   ``As long as we can make a noise and contribute to preventing
this kind of retrogressive step, then we think it's very important
that we and other American companies retain a presence there,'' said
Gavin Anderson, director of executive services.
   The Conservative Party councilors who took power in Boksburg on
Oct. 26 remain committed to whites-only amenities despite a black
consumer boycott that began in mid-December and harsh criticism from
business groups, the press and the governing National Party.
   Both the Conservatives and anti-apartheid politicians to the left
of the National Party have accused the government of hypocrisy,
noting that it has made no move to repeal the law that allows
segregation of local facilities.
   Adrian Botha, executive director the American Chamber of Commerce
in South Africa, said his organization supported Colgate's attempt
to disavow Boksburg but felt the government bore responsibility.
   ``The Conservative Party is acting quite legally,'' Botha said.
``The fault lies with people who introduced those laws.''
   Anderson said Colgate hadn't decided on its strategy if the
Benoni proposal fails, but he indicated the factory is unlikely to
be relocated.
   ``Ours is not a business like a shop that you can pick up and
move to the next town,'' he said.
   Colgate began marketing soaps, shaving cream and toothpaste in
South Africa in 1929, opened a factory in East London in 1937, and
moved in 1958 to Boksburg, about 15 miles east of Johannesburg.
   Boksburg's town clerk, Johan Coetsee, said the council hadn't yet
discussed the Colgate application to be incorporated into Benoni. He
said the maneuver could prove impossible, partly because Boksburg
provides Colgate's factory with electricity, water and sewage
service.
   The company's public affairs director, Sylvia Hayward, says
Colgate has been ``chipping away at apartheid'' through various
programs, including financial aid for aspiring black entrepreneurs,
multiracial private schools and a mobile denistry clinic.
   Assessing the Boksburg controversy, Nocker said the town
councilors ``are really turning the clock back. I can't imagine the
kind of thinking that goes on at those council meetings.''

<HEAD>Land Company To Offer Restitution Under 5-State Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patten Corp., a land company whose sales
practices have stirred controversy, has agreed to pay restitution to
customers who can prove they were sold property under false
pretenses, according to proposed consent decrees filed Wednesday in
five Northeast states.
   The agreements, which were scheduled to be released separately by
officials in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York and
Massachusetts, would end consumer-fraud investigations into Patten's
activities in the five states and require Patten to pay each state
$100,000.
   Patten did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement, and it
was not immediately clear how much land or how many customers are
involved.
   Maine Attorney General James E. Tierney said Maine's interest was
``by far the largest'' of the five states.
   ``This was no nickel-and-dime operation,'' Tierney said. ``Many
scenic and recreational areas in Maine were systematically acquired,
cut up for resale and marketed in high-pressure campaigns that
violated Maine laws and preyed upon unsuspecting, unknowing
consumers.
   ``Patten brought the rogue morality of Wall Street to the woods
of Maine,'' he said.
   Patten, based in Stamford, Conn., said in a statement that it had
``cooperated fully and voluntarily'' with the state investigators.
   ``Many of the requirements in the agreements are already Patten
policy, and the agreements will enable the company to further its
policy of dealing fairly and quickly with customer complaints,''
said the statement.
   Company President Harry Patten was quoted as saying, ``While the
company denies violating any consumer laws, we believe the
agreements serve the interests of the company, its shareholders and
customers.''
   The company said, in reporting separately on its latest earnings
results, that it had taken a pre-tax deduction of $2.6 million to
reserves which were set aside for anticipated expenses relating to
the latest settlement as well as a tentative agreement in settlement
of a previously-disclosed dispute in Pennsylvania.
   ``The company believes that the amounts allocated to the reserves
will cover all potential future costs relating to the two matters,''
the statement said.
   A complaint filed with the proposed settlement in Superior Court
in Augusta alleges that Patten routinely lured customers, many of
them from other states, by advertising property in rural Maine at
prices substantially lower than what was actually available.
   The complaint also alleges Patten misled prospective customers on
numerous matters, including the potential for building on the
property and access to utilities, roads and municipal services. For
example, one unidentified buyer cited in the complaint was assured
that utility service was ``available,'' only to learn later that it
would cost $23,000 to bring electricity to the land.
   Under the pending Maine consent decree, which Tierney said is
virtually identical to those in the other states, Patten is required
to make available a dispute resolution procedure to anyone who
purchased land in the state or any resident who purchased land from
Patten between Aug. 1, 1982 and May 1, 1989.
   People who can prove that Patten ``misrepresented or omitted a
material fact'' in selling the property will be entitled to full
reimbursement, including the purchase price, interest, taxes and
closing costs.
   Customers who can show that they were forced to pay unreasonably
high prices to improving the property because of similar
misrepresentations are entitled to partial restitution under the
agreement.
   Also, any dispute that cannot be resolved within 45 days can be
taken before the American Arbitration Assocation.

<TEXT>
   The impact of disposable cigarette lighters
on the wooden match business is painfully obvious to Don Bronikowski
when the night shift arrives at the match plant where he's worked
for 33 years.
   ``We were geared up years ago to make matches until hell freezes
over. Three shifts, five days a week,'' says Bronikowski of Diamond
Brands Inc., one of only two large-scale wooden matchmakers left in
the United States. ``Now we're down to one shift, five days a week.''
   So instead of cranking out the familiar strike-anywhere splints,
Diamond's second-shift workers spend the night making corn dog
sticks, ice pop sticks, toothpicks, tongue depressors and other
small products.
   Diamond and Universal Match Co., of Kenner, La., the only other
major wooden matchmaker in the United States, survived the early
1970s onslaught of disposable lighters by closing plants and
consolidating manufacturing.
   The growing popularity of electric stoves and foreign-made wooden
matches also have taken away business, but throwaway lighters took
by far the biggest cut, reducing the wooden match's 50 percent
market share to about 20 percent.
   ``When Bic and Cricket (lighters) and all them came out they
raised hell with the market,'' said Bronikowski, 57, who is quality
control manager. ``Our business just went down, down, down.''
   Industry watchers estimate about 650 billion wooden matches are
used annually in the United States. Lighters control about 65
percent of the market, while book matches and other sources account
for the remainder, Bronikowski said.
   From peak employment of about 450 in the 1950s when the Cloquet
plant made matches only, the Diamond workforce shrank to slightly
more than 100 in the mid-1970s.
   At least seven wooden matchmakers have closed their doors in
recent years, Bronikowski said.
   Universal, a subsidiary of Stockholm-based Swedish Match Corp.,
has closed a book match plant in Hudson, N.Y. Diamond has closed two
plants in Maine.
   By consolidating, Diamond has equipped the Cloquet plant to
produce items such as corn dog sticks _ demand for which has
skyrocketed because of the food's use in school hot lunch programs,
Bronikowski said _ and non-match items now account for about half of
the plant's sales.
   Previous unsuccessful attempts to diversify included a
chopsticks-making venture in 1980. Bronikowski said the plant
couldn't meet the precise specifications of Japanese buyers and
aborted the operation in less than two years.
   The successful diversification efforts have boosted employment at
the Cloquet plant, some 15 miles west of Duluth in northeastern
Minnesota, to 325 from 160 in 1985.
   Most of the improvement at Diamond has occurred in the past six
years, a period that included two ownership changes. Jefferson
Smurfit Inc. of Alton, Ill., bought the company in 1983 and sold it
in October 1986 to St. Louis Park-based Diamond Brands, a
privately-held company.
   Irene Rudnicki, a plant supervisor who has been active in the
employees' union, said the Cloquet plant survived partly because the
union agreed to major wage concessions for new employees. About 60
percent of the workers at Cloquet are women and wages range from
$5.97 to $10.60 an hour.
   Bronikowski said it takes about 75 minutes to convert ribbons of
poplar into wooden matches and the plant makes about 60 million a
day. In addition to the large strike-anywhere variety, the plant
makes smaller ``penny'' matches that are struck against the box. An
average tree from the surrounding hillsides can produce about 1.1
million matches, he said.
   Unlike Universal, Diamond doesn't manufacture book matches, even
though it sells them. Richard C. Jones, Universal's national sales
manager, said the only other large scale U.S. book match maker is
D.D. Bean Co. in Jaffrey, N.H.

   Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after soybean meal futures
plummeted to 12-week lows.
   The break in soybean meal futures came in response to talk that
U.S. soybean meal producers were cutting cash prices by $2 to $4 per
ton in a bid to stimulate demand, analysts said.
   Soybean meal futures closed $3 to $5.70 lower with the contract
for delivery in March at $236.90 a ton.
   The decline sparked rumors that the Soviet Union planned to
cancel some of its purchases of U.S. soybeans.
   Corn futures fell in sympathy with soybeans but wheat futures
advanced slightly on rumors that the Soviet Union was seeking to
purchase 600,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices
under the long-term grain agreement signed late last year.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 1\ cents higher with March at
$4.28{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4\ cents lower with March at
$2.63{ a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 5 cents lower with March at

   Billionaire developer Donald Trump selected
former Gaming Control Board chairman Mike Rumbolz to head his Nevada
operations, a sign Trump is intent on becoming a major player in the
state's gaming industry.
   Rumbolz announced the move Wednesday, saying he will head Trump's

   The former Control Board chief said he had been negotiating with
Trump since January. Rumbolz did not reapply for his job with the
Control Board when his term expired in December.
   Trump has said for more than a year that he is interested in
becoming involved in Nevada gaming and has disclosed he has a small
stake in Caesars World Inc., a casino operator.
   Rumbolz said he's not certain whether Trump will buy or build in
Nevada.
   ``We're looking at several possible developments as well as some
acquisitions,'' Rumbolz said. ``It's impossible to say how soon we
will make a move. There are so many variables that would impact the
timing.''
   Rumbolz said Trump is looking at possible projects both in Las
Vegas and Laughlin, Nev. Rumbolz said he did not anticipate any
regulatory problems in getting Trump licensed in Nevada.
   In an interview in November, Trump said there was ``tremendous
support'' for his entry into Nevada gaming.
   ``I've been coming here for a long time, and I've always been
very, very well received,'' Trump said. ``This area likes Donald
Trump.''
   Caesars World announced earlier that the real estate magnate had
filed notice with federal agencies to buy more than 15 percent
interest in ther company, and possibly in excess of 50 percent.
   Trump has said he is ``more likely to build'' a new hotel-casino
than buy an existing property.``Then I can do it absolutely first
class,'' he said.

   Alfred H. Kingon, the U.S. ambassador to
the European Economic Community, said Wednesday he has resigned to
return to the private sector.
   ``It's time for me to go home,'' said Kingon, who has been the
U.S. envoy to the 12-nation trading bloc for nearly two years.
   He said President Bush has chosen a successor whom he declined to
identify.
   Kingon said he has no firm job plans yet. ``I do want to go home
to New York, where we have family and friends,'' he said.
   He lauded a plan to curtail trade barriers among the group's 12
members by 1992 to create a European-wide market.
   ``I believe in Europe. I believe in 1992,'' he said. ``I believe,
in spite of all the problems that exist, that there's a very
reasonable chance the Europeans will achieve what they want to do.''
   Kingon, 57, became ambassador to the body, also known as the
Common Market, in April 1987.
   He earlier served as an assistant to former President Reagan.
Before entering government, he was an editor of the publications
Financial World, Saturday Review and Money and Credit.

   Fancier foods, individual video machines and
money-back guarantees are among the amenities that big airlines are
offering to first-class fliers as competition for travelers
increasingly highlights service instead of price.
   The latest campaign was unveiled Wednesday by British Airways
PLC, which said it is investing $40 million to upgrade its
first-class service on long-haul flights beginning March 1.
   The changes, detailed at a news conference in New York, include
individual passenger video terminals at each seat, redesigned cabin
interiors, a new wine cellar and menus that allow passengers to eat
when they wish.
   ``This investment is a bold and calculated bid for commercial
supremacy in an intensely competitive market,'' said Sir Colin
Marshall, the airline's chief executive.
   The program reflects the increasing importance to many airlines
of their first-class business _ which accounts for nearly $400
million of British Airways' annual revenue _ in the wake of years of
fare wars that have made it tougher to compete for passengers on the
basis of price.
   This is especially true in the United States, where airline
industry deregulation has meant cheaper fares by all carriers,
making it harder to compete by slashing fares.
   First class accounted for 10.3 percent of the revenue generated
by major U.S. airlines in 1988, compared with 9 percent in 1983,
according to the Air Transport Association.
   First class still isn't cheap: British Airways' round-trip,
first-class fare between New York and London is $4,880, compared
with about $900 for an economy-class ticket.
   But even Continental Airlines, which long has had a reputation as
a fare-cutting leader, has re-emphasized service. The carrier last
August tested a novel money-back service guarantee for its
first-class passengers, under which fliers could get a refund of up
to $200 if they were dissatisfied with any aspect of their domestic
flights, from making reservations to claiming their baggage.
   In Western Europe, the gradual liberalization of the industry has
spawned small independent airlines and some cheaper fares. It also
has increased the role of business class, the service that falls
between coach and first class.
   Business class generally offers hurried business travelers
separate check-in facilities, airport lounges with work areas and
wider airplane seats, while stopping short of such first-class
amenities as gourmet food.
   Business class sales have grown so strongly at Scandinavian
Airline System that the company is scrapping its first class service
entirely in favor of business and economy fares.
   Business class doesn't widely exist on domestic U.S. flights. But
fast-growing Piedmont Aviation has introduced a similar service
targeted mainly at business travelers.
   In June 1987 Piedmont introduced first-class service with all the
trimmings at relatively cheaper fares, charging first-class
passengers a premium over the economy fare of up to $60 one way,
depending on distance. That's well below normal first-class fares,
which often run about double domestic economy fares.
   Between Dallas and Miami, for example, Piedmont's competitors
charge $430 to $860 round trip for a regular economy ticket, and
$1,292 for first-class service. Piedmont's economy fares are
similar, but it charges around $300 less for a first-class round
trip ticket.
   USAir Group Inc., which is set to formally acquire Piedmont in
early August, plans to adopt the same service.
   ``There is a certain segment of the market that demands a
first-class product,'' said Mike Clark, a Piedmont spokesman at the
airline's Winston-Salem, N.C., headquarters.
   Another U.S. airline offers nothing but first class. The glitzy
MGM Grand Air, owned by California financier Kirk Kerkorian, only
flies between New York and Los Angeles, for $1,878 round trip.
   What sort of people fly first class?
   According to British Airways, they fall into two categories: the
``Patrician'' and the ``Achiever.'' The Patrician ``has established
wealth, is relaxed but has exacting standards, does not want to be
overly pampered and chooses first class as a matter of course.''
   The Achiever is ``usually a self-made individual who is more
status conscious, is a conspicuous consumer, seeks recognition and
uses first class as a signal of accomplishment.''
   British Airways says its new first-class service is aimed mainly
at business people, predominantly male, usually in their late 40s
and holding to corporate positions such as chairman or chief
executive.
   In the United States, much of the growth in first-class traffic
appears to have come from ``Achiever'' business travelers who don't
have a business class to fly in domestically.
   Furthermore, many first-class passengers are members of
frequent-flier programs who got upgrades to first-class tickets as
awards for accumulating mileage.

   Stock prices were little changed Wednesday,
bogging down after Tuesday's advance that carried the market to new
post-crash highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed 26.07
points on Tuesday and added another 10 points at the outset
Wednesday, closed with a 3.93 loss at 2,343.21.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 762 up, 722
down and 508 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 189.42 million
shares, down from 217.26 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 224.83 million shares.
   The market's rally that began in late November showed signs of
flattening out in the first few sessions of this month.
   It revived on Tuesday in response to General Motors's
announcement of a dividend increase and plans for a 2-for-1 stock
split.
   Analysts said demand for stock was particularly strong at
investing institutions where money managers had built up large cash
reserves in the aftermath of the October 1987 crash.
   Rising stock prices have put pressure on many of these money
managers to increase their stock holdings or run the risk of missing
out on what could amount to a significant market advance.
   But after a wave of buying at the opening Wednesday, the market
turned skittish and erratic again.
   General Motors shares pulled back { to 93] after jumping 4]
points Tuesday.
   Other losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down | at 127; General Electric, down ~ at 47{; Sears
Roebuck, down 1[ at 42\, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down [
at 32.
   Brokers said traders were also disappointed by recent weakness in
the Dow Jones average of 20 transportation stocks, which fell 11.81
Wednesday to 1,076.16.
   At the end of last week, noted William LeFevre at Advest Inc.,
the transportation average had climbed to within less than 18 points
of the peak close of 1,101.16 it reached in 1987 before the market
crash.
   Among the recently-hot airline issues, AMR fell ~ to 59|; Delta
Air Lines 1 to 55}; UAL } to 121{, and NWA [ to 64.
   Dayton Hudson, subject of takover speculation, climbed 1] to 46[.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $5.77 billion, or 0.20
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .33 to 167.69.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.10 to 345.31, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down .98 at 298.65.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

value index closed at 327.23, up .85.

   Crude futures prices slumped in light trading
Wednesday, influenced partly by higher American Petroleum Institute
statistics.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 21
cents to close the day at $17.49 a barrel. The contract had risen 32
cents in Tuesday's session. Contracts for delivery later in the year
also declined.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the March contract
for unleaded gasoline lost 0.32 cent to settle at 48.94 cents, while
domestic heating oil declined 0.80 cent to 49.07 cents a gallon.
Other contract months also fell.
   Observers attributed the slide in prices to a combination of
factors, including a technical correction following several weeks of
rising prices and the weekly API report.
   The API's weekly statistics on domestic energy supplies showed
crude oil stocks rose by 7 million barrels a day, while unleaded
gasoline increased 3.7 million barrels. Heating oil, meanwhile,
declined 3.4 million barrels.
   Traders said some of the rise in crude oil stocks may be the
``lost OPEC oil'' that analysts have been looking for.
   Since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' cut
production Jan. 1, market analysts have looked for a weakening in
oil prices as the excess oil produced by the cartel late last year
entered the market.
   Instead, prices have risen steadily, surprising analysts and
leaving many to wonder what happened to the excess oil.
   OPEC was estimated to have produced more than 22 million barrels
per day of oil at the end of 1988. On Jan. 1, it was to lower
production to 18.5 million barrels, although estimates are that it
is producing more than 19 million.
   Nevertheless, analysts have guessed that the excess was either on
tankers en route to market, in on-shore storage tanks in the Middle
East or still in the ground.
   Energy traders said Tuesday's API report suggests that the lost
oil might finally be arriving on the market.

   The Agriculture Department reported Wednesday
that the nation's flock of sheep and lambs increased slightly in
1988 for the third consecutive year.
   The increase was only a small fraction of 1 percent, however,
boosting the U.S. flock to an estimated 10,802,000 sheep and lambs
on Jan. 1 from 10,784,000 on Jan. 1, 1988.
   Despite the recent gains, the Jan. 1 count was one of the
smallest in U.S. history, according to department records going back
for more than a century.
   In 1970, for example, there were 20.4 million sheep and lambs in
the nation's flocks. And in 1867, when the department began counting
sheep, there were about 46.3 million head. The industry peaked in
1942 at 56.2 million.
   ``Primarily the decline stems from less demand for wool as more
synthetics and cheaper substitute materials were introduced and the
declining demand for lamb in consumer diets,'' the report said.
   Also, it said, there has been ``increased difficulty in obtaining
and keeping reliable herders to manage and care for range flocks,
and increased competing uses for public-owned rangeland.''
   Predators, including coyotes, also are blamed for the decline in
the U.S. sheep industry.
   The value of sheep and lambs as of Jan. 1 was estimated at $890
million, down 8 percent, with the average at $82.40 per head,
compared with $90 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Cattle Tally Shocks Futures Markets; Sharp Losses Predicted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department report pegging the nation's cattle herd
at 99.5 million head drew expressions of shock and amazement
Wednesday from market experts who had expected a much lower number.
   Analysts predicted cattle futures prices would drop sharply
Thursday in reaction to the cattle inventory report. Cattle futures
settled narrowly mixed Wednesday in cautious pre-report trading.
   On other markets Wednesday, soybean futures were down sharply;
precious metals advanced; and energy futures retreated.
   Livestock-market analysts had projected about a 1.4 percent net
decline in the nation's cattle herd during 1988, to 97.6 million
head, due in part to widespread herd liquidation as a result of the
summer drought.
   But the USDA said the U.S. cattle herd as of Jan. 1 was about the
same size as it was a year earlier.
   ``I was shocked,'' said Charles Levitt, senior livestock market
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   Analysts base their projections on previous USDA cattle inventory
reports, which are released semi-annually, and on the daily
slaughter numbers provided by packing houses.
   One explanation for the surprising number could be found in the
USDA's contention that the number of calves born in 1988 was 2
percent higher than the number born in 1987.
   But even with the large calf crop, ``the numbers are larger than
we could possibly have pieced together using any balance sheet
approach,'' Levitt said. ``The only thing I can say at this point is
that it appears we have a phantom herd out there.''
   Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington
Heights, Ill., said cattle futures traders had been ``faked out'' by
the two previous cattle inventory reports, which had set a pattern
of declining cattle numbers that many had expected would continue.
   Although futures prices were expected to register an immediate
reaction to the report, Morgan said the impact on beef prices would
not be felt until late 1989 or early 1990, when the the calves born
in the second half of 1988 are ready for slaughter.
   In futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live
cattle settled .30 cent lower to .40 cent higher with the contract
for delivery in February at 75.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.08 cent lower to .25 cent higher with March at 84.42 cents a pound;
live hogs were .25 cent lower to .65 cent higher with February at
42.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .65 cent lower to .02
cent higher with February at 38.30 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade
on rumors the Soviet Union planned to shift some of its purchases of
U.S. soybeans and soybean meal to South American producers.
   Corn futures fell in sympathy with soybeans but wheat futures
advanced slightly on rumors that the Soviets were seeking to
purchase 600,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices
under the long-term grain agreement signed late last year.
   Wheat settled { cent to 1 cent higher with March at $4.28\ a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 3 cents lower with March at $2.64} a
bushel; oats were 3} cents to 5 cents lower with March at $2.09{ a
bushel; soybeans were 9\ cents to 11{ cents lower with March at
$7.46 a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures strengthened on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to the dollar's decline against other major
currencies.
   Gold settled $3.60 to $3.90 higher with April at $399.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 5.5 cents to 5.9 cents higher with March at $5.945
a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices drifted lower in dull trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents to 22 cents
lower with March at $17.49 a barrel; heating oil was .44 cent to .80
cent lower with March at 49.07 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.25 cent to .82 cent lower with March at 48.94 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Major Damage to California Floral, Citrus Crops Predicted From Cold
Wave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The arctic cold wave that blew through
California this week sent shivers through the state's
multimillion-dollar floral and citrus industries, ruining part of
the lemon crop and possibly boosting the price of a Valentine
bouquet.
   As the weather moderated in the state's major growing regions
Wednesday, growers assessed the cold-caused damage by slicing open
lemons and eyeing rows of drooping carnations.
   ``There's going to be a shortage right now. They're (carnations)
just not blooming,'' said Mark Yamaguchi, a grower-shipper in
Monterey County.
   Many growers and packers said lemon groves in the San Joaquin
Valley in central Califronia were hit hard by the cold wave, with
some early estimates that 35 percent of the existing crop may have
been damaged.
   California is the nation's top producer of lemons, a crop valued
at $152 million in 1987. It will take about a week to 10 days for an
accurate assessment of the frost's damage, industry experts said.
   But prices already have risen for some crops. The industry's
wholesale price for a 40-pound box of medium sized oranges jumped $1
to $7.50, and a box of larger oranges also jumped $1 to $10.50, said
George Lombardi, marketing director for Sequoia Farms in Exeter.
   Flower growers in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties already have
seen the effect on their crops.
   ``The damage is done. The freeze has damaged the crops out there
and I don't expect them to recover at all,'' said George Ginilo,
agriculture commissioner of central California's San Mateo County.
The county's 1987 floral crop was valued at $165 million and serves
wholesalers on the West Coast and in New England.
   But while some major suppliers of California flowers predicted a
shortage, it was unclear whether it would affect the market by
Valentine's Day. Yamaguchi said 80 percent of the national carnation
market comes from foreign growers.
   The California Farm Bureau Federation said imports and greenhouse
flowers should provide a ``tight but adequate'' supply of flowers
for Valentine's Day, but said prices may be ``slightly higher in
some cases.''
   Daisies, irises, pom poms, baby's breath and other flowers grown
in open fields may be in short supply even with the imports, said
the federation's floriculture specialist, Maria Sampanis.
   Growers were running greenhouse boilers were run around the clock
for warmth and to encourage roses to bloom on time for Feb. 14. But
Half Moon Bay nursery owner Natalie Pastorino worried the flowers
might bloom late this year.
   ``We're crossing our fingers that the cold weather ends,'' said
Ms. Pastorino. ``If we get the crop after Valentine's (Day), we'll
lose money because the demand is not there.''
   Other crops _ lettuce, carrots, and broccoli _ sustained damage
in Monterrey County, with up to 20 to 25 percent of plantings lost
on some farms, said Richard Nutter, the county agricultural
commissioner.
   Among citrus, the icicles that hung from orange and lemons
earlier this week in the San Joaquin Valley have melted and growers
are waiting for signs of damage to appear.
   Citrus fares poorly when the temperature drops to 26 or lower for
extended periods. In central California's Terra Bella, the prime
region for Tulare County's $357 million citrus crop, temperatures
stayed at 23 degrees or lower for 8{ hours Monday night and Tuesday
morning.
   Growers were more optimistic about the state's $242 million navel
orange crop, which is fairly mature and contains a high sugar
content that helps ward off frost.
   In Southern California, cloud cover and winds prevented a heavy
freeze and spared citrus, flower and avocado crop from serious
damage, officials said. But winds may have scarred or knocked some
fruit from the trees.
   Also, San Bernardino County's $10 million orange crop suffered 25
degree temperatures for 6{ hours, said John Gardner, assistant
agricultural commissioner.

<HEAD>Pan Am Shuttle Launches New Ad Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. announced a new advertising campaign
Wednesday for its Northeast shuttle service.
   Pan Am officials said their service now commands nearly 50
percent of the air shuttle market between New York, Boston and
Washington, shared with the rival hourly shuttle operated by Eastern
Airlines. Pan Am's share of the market is up from around 38 percent
a year ago, company officials said.
   New York developer Donald Trump, having recently cleared a number
of regulatory hurdles, is scheduled to complete his acquisition of
the Eastern shuttle for $365 million in cash within the next month
or so.
   Pan Am officials denied that the new ad blitz, with the theme
``The Pan Am Shuttle: The Corporate Jet,'' was planned in
anticipation of the flamboyant Trump's debut as a competitor.
   The ad campaign ``is related to positioning the Pan Am shuttle as
a leader in the market,'' said Peter McHugh, Pan Am's senior vice
president of marketing. ``The new entrant (Trump) ought to be
thinking about what they're going to do to react to us.''
   McHugh conceded that curiosity about Trump will prompt some
passengers to take his shuttle service on a trial basis, because of
the publicity surrounding the developer. However, he said, Trump
will likely have difficulty meeting the public's expectations for
his shuttle.
   ``He (Trump) may clean it up, but it's still a duck,'' McHugh
said.
   Pan Am plans to spend around $10 million on the new ad campaign,
which will be run by Grey Advertising Inc. Targeted at the shuttle's
predominantly business traveler market, the print and broadcast
campaign will emphasize services such as automatic ticketing at
airport terminals and on-board telephones.

   The dollar edged narrowly lower against several
major currencies Wednesday as traders appeared reluctant to
speculate on currency shifts in advance of President Bush's budget
address on Thursday.
   A commitment by Bush to take strong action against the budget
deficit could support the dollar, while weak remarks would be likely
to send the dollar lower.
   ``The market took the Bush speech as a signal to just lay low for
the day,'' said Don Quattrucci, a trader at Connecticut National
Bank in Hartford, Conn.
   Gold prices rose in New York after having fallen earlier in the
trading day in Europe. Republic National Bank of New York said gold

<HEAD>4th-Qtr Profit Falls at CBS, Washington Post; Up at NY Times, Times-Mirror</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said Wednesday its fourth-quarter profit dropped 84
percent from strong results a year ago that included a huge gain on
the sale of its magazine division, and that income from its
broadcasting operations fell 37 percent.
   Two other media concerns posted profit gains for the quarter as
earnings rose 19 percent at the New York Times Co. and 77 percent at
Times-Mirror Co.
   But the Washington Post Co. reported its fourth-quarter profit
dropped 42.7 percent from a year ago.
   CBS said its net income fell to $40.1 million, or $1.56 a share,
in the three months ended Dec. 31 from $251.6 million, or $9.73 a
share, in the same period in 1987.
   Fourth-quarter revenue slipped 1 percent to $772 million from
$773 million.
   The 1987 results included a $179.8 million gain on the sale of
CBS Magazines.
   The company said income from continuing operations rose 78
percent to $40.1 million in the quarter, boosted by higher interest
income and lower corporate expenses.
   But the CBS Broadcast operations' profit fell to $12.4 million
from $19.8 million a year earlier.
   It said the CBS television network results were depressed by the
22-week Writer's Guild strike which delayed the start of the current
television season and led to lower audience ratings and ad revenue.
CBS trails NBC and ABC in prime-time audience ratings.
   CBS said its television stations and radio operations each
reported higher sales and income for the period.
   For the year, CBS said it earned a record $1.15 billion, or
$44.75 a share, compared with $452.5 million, or $17.74 a share, a
year earlier.
   Full-year revenue rose 1 percent to $2.78 billion from $2.76
billion.
   The full-year results reflected a gain of $866 million on the
sale of the CBS Records division in January and interest income on
the investment of money generated by asset sales. The company had
net interest income of $185 million in 1988 compared with a net
interest expense of $6.9 million in 1987.
   New York Times Co. said its net income rose to $50.4 million, or
64 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $42.5 million, or 52
cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3 percent to $450 million from from
$435.5 million a year earlier.
   For the year, it said net income rose 5 percent to a record
$167.7 million, or $2.08 a share, from $160.3 million, or $1.96 a
share, a year ago.
   Full-year revenue rose 4 percent to $1.7 billion from $1.6
billion in 1987.
   Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive, said ``the
softening in some markets is likely to result in a down first
quarter in 1989.''
   In addition to publishing the New York Times, the company has
interests in regional newspapers, magazines, broadcasting and forest
products.
   Times-Mirror, based in Los Angeles, said it earned $96.8 million,
or 76 cents a share, up from $54.7 million, or 42 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 6.9 percent to $925 million from $865
million.
   The 1988 results include a $2 million gain on sale of assets,
while the 1987 results included a pretax loss of $43.7 million on
asset sales.
   For the year, the company said it earned $332 million, or $2.58 a
share, up from $266 million, or $2.06 a share, a year earlier.
   Full-year revenue rose to $3.33 billion from $3.14 billion a year
ago.
   The 1988 results included a $58.9 million gain on the sale of
assets, while the 1987 results reflected a $29.2 million loss on the
sale of assets.
   The company publishes newspapers including the Los Angeles Times,
and has interests in television stations, cable television,
magazines and books.
   Washington Post Co. said it earned $36.9 million, or $2.87 a
share, in the fourth quarter compared to $64.4 million, or $5.01 per
share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 1.6 percent to $370.8 million from
$365 million a year earlier.
   The latest results included a $12.6 million charge related to a
previously-disclosed restructuring at Newsweek while the 1987
earnings included $23.5 million in one-time gains from the sale of
cellular telephone interests.
   For the year, the company earned $269.1 million, or $20.91 a
share, up 44.1 percent from $186.7 million, or $14.52 a share, a
year ago.
   Full-year revenue rose 4 percent to $1.37 billion from $1.32
billion in 1987.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal arbitrator has ruled that the largest
union at Pan Am Corp. must give the financially ailing airline wage
and benefit concessions totaling $21 million, Pan Am said Wednesday.
   Pan Am had sought $27 million in concessions from the Transport
Workers Union, which represents about 5,900 mechanics, aircraft
service personnel and flight dispatchers at the nation's
eighth-largest airline.
   Last August, the Transport Workers membership rejected a new
cost-cutting contract that had been agreed to by its leadership and
Pan Am. The airline and the union later accepted federal arbitration
in their contract talks.
   Officials of the union were unavailable for comment late
Wednesday.
   ``We are very pleased that we've been able to achieve substantial
savings without conflict,'' said Pan Am spokesman Jeff Kriendler.
   He said the $21 million in mandated concessions include a wage
freeze and reductions in paid holidays.
   Pan Am has imposed $35 million in cuts on employees represented
by the Teamsters union under federal labor rules. The three unions
representing pilots, flight engineers and flight attendants have
agreed to cuts totaling about $300 million over three years.

<HEAD>Austral Continues Slide Against Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina's national currency fell
another 13 percent against the dollar Wednesday, continuing its
slide in the wake of the government's decision not to stabilize the
austral in foreign exchange.
   At the close of business Wednesday, the dollar fetched 27
australs, compared to 23.50 a day earlier and 17.59 last Friday.
   Some exchange houses were asking 29 to 30 australs to the dollar,
or simply bought and held dollars waiting for the price _ and thus
their profits _ to rise further.
   On Tuesday, when banks and foreign exchange houses opened
following a one-day, government-ordered holiday, the austral's value
slid by 25 percent against the dollar.
   The fluctuations follow the Central Bank's announcement Sunday
evening that it no longer would intervene in foreign exchange to
stabilize the austral, a goal toward which it spent at least $1
billion _ an estimated one-quarter of its liquid reserves _ during
the past several months.
   By making $20 million to $30 million a day available to banks and
foreign exchange houses, and by supporting interest rates on
financial instruments, the government encouraged Argentines to keep
money in australs and in accounts that could be tapped for lending
purposes.
   The goal also was to dampen inflation, which accelerated to 8.9
percent in January and was 387 percent for 1988, by holding down the
cost of imports and Argentine products generally denominated in
dollars, such as apartments, cars and airline tickets.
   The bubble burst last week when Argentines bought $486 million
offered by the Central Bank, even though interest rates on
certificates of deposit and austral-denominated financial
instruments were hiked to near 20 percent a month.
   The Central Bank was criticized by the opposition Peronist Party
as using foreign exchange reserves _ built up partly by not making
payments on Argentina's $58.6 billion foreign debt _ for the
political purpose of creating a favorable perception about the
economy.
   On Wednesday, as Argentines with dollars went shopping in search
of bargains before prices could be raised, Treasury Secretary Mario
Brodersohn denied rumors that Central Bank President Jose Luis
Machinea would resign.
   ``He hasn't resigned and he won't resign,'' Brodersohn said.

   Eastman Kodak Co. said Wednesday its
profit for the fourth quarter rose 29 percent from a year ago,
capping off a year of record sales and profit for the photographic
giant.
   The news came amid speculation that the company was planning to
announce job reductions. Two newspapers have received internal memos
from Kodak executives that indicate the job reduction plan will be
explained to workers in Thursday's edition of the employee newspaper.
   ``As a matter of policy, we do not comment on rumors. If there is
anything to report we would tell our employees first,'' said Kodak
spokesman Paul Allen.
   Kodak reported a profit of $312 million, or 96 cents a share, in
the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 25, up from $242 million, or 75
cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter sales rose 29 percent to $4.54 billion from $3.52
billion.
   Kodak's profit for 1988 rose 19 percent to a record $1.4 billion,
or $4.31 a share, from $1.2 billion, or $3.52 a share, in 1987.
   Kodak sales rose 28 percent to a record $17.03 billion for the
year from $13.3 billion in 1987.
   ``It was a good quarter and a good year,'' said Charles Ryan, a
securities analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York.
   Before the earnings report, Ryan had projected Kodak earnings for
1989 at $4.60 a share. He now expects $4.70 a share.
   The company posted 9 percent growth for the quarter and the year
in domestic sales in its imaging segment which includes photographic
film and paper and copier products. Ryan said that was more than
double recent growth.
   The results were boosted by the contribution of Sterling Drug
Co., which Kodak acquired in February 1988.
   But Allen said even if Sterling Drug's contributions were
excluded, the company would have established new sales and earnings
records for the year.

<HEAD>Nissan Introduces New Z-Car</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Ass ociated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Corp. on Wednesday introduced the
newest in its line of Z-cars, a redesigned 300ZX, aimed at competing
with Porsche and other snazzy European sportscars.
   Nissan officials said new 300ZX coupe, to be in showrooms in
April as a 1990 model, is the fourth-generation of the car
originally introduced by Datsun Motor Corp., Nissan's ancestor, in
the fall of 1979 as the 240Z.
   ``Nissan underwent a complete metamorphosis and the new Z-car was
developed,'' Katsuo Yamada, Nissan's general manager for product
development, told a news conference at the Chicago auto show.
   ``In redesigning the new Z-car, we were determined to return to
its standard,'' he said. ``We received complaints from true sports
car enthusiasts saying it had become just a sporty-looking luxury
car.''
   Sales of Z-cars rose annually from the introduction of the 240Z
until 1979, when sales of the 280Z reached 71,983 cars. Sales later
slipped to about 24,000 last year.
   Bob Thomas, vice president and general manager of the Nissan
Division of Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., predicted that sales of
the 300ZX would total about 3,000 a month, or 36,000 annually.
   With the 300ZX, Nissan eliminated all digital instrumentation,
replacing it with traditional dials and gauges. The engine was
beefed up to a 3.0-liter, V-6 with 222 horsepower, 17 more than the
current 300ZX.
   The 1990 version's overall length is shorter than the '88's,
while the distance between its wheels has been increased. And the
car is narrower, making it appear squattier than its predecessor.
   Thomas said the decision to stay with the 300ZX name stemmed from
the size of the engine.
   ``We felt the car would stand on its own,'' he said.
   Auto analyst Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. in San
Francisco said there should be no confusion between the two cars,
despite the same name.
   ``The market they're going for is one that intimately knows what
this car does,'' he said. ``It's a very sophisticated market.''
   Thomas said some of the 300ZX buyers would be Porsche shoppers
along with others looking at European ``exotics,'' such as Jaguar
and, possibly, Mercedes-Benz. But he guessed that the bulk of 300ZX
buyers would come from curent or former Z-car owners.
   The coupe is to be introduced in April, with an estimated base
price in the middle or high $20,000 range. The 300ZX four-seater is
to be introduced in late July or early August and a turbo-charged
version will be available in the fall. The price of the four-seater
is expected to be slightly more than that for the coupe, and the
turbo will cost more than $30,000, Thomas said.
   When it was introduced originally, the 240Z carried a base price
of $3,526 for a car with a 2.4-liter, in-line six-cylinder engine.
It boasted 150 horsepower.

<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc., the target of a $1.53
billion takeover bid, Wednesday set a deadline for new bids and
postponed a special shareholders meeting.
   The textile company, which is being sought by Farley Inc. for $52
a share, has announced it will accept bids matching or exceeding its
current stock price, which has risen above $55 per share in the last
week.
   West Point-based Pepperell set a Feb. 15 deadline for competing
offers, the same day Farley's bid is due to expire. Farley last week
raised its $48-per-share made in October.
   The shareholders meeting was postponed to March 2 from Feb. 25,
but the company gave no reason for the delay.
   The meeting was called by Farley and supporters in an attempt to
oust the current board of directors, which has repeatedly rejected
Farley's bid, and replace it with a favorable slate of directors.
   Farley spokesman Jack Albertine said the company agreed to the
delay, but he declined comment on Pepperell's bid deadline.
   Pepperell closed Wednesday at $55.37{, up 25 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   ``What I think's going to happen is that there's going to be some
kind of negotiated settlement,'' said Kay Norwood, an analyst with
Johnson Lane Space Smith &amp; Co. Inc. in Charlotte, N.C. ``It looks
like some of the fight's gone out. We don't see any external,
spirited bidding.''
   Farley announced last week that the number of shares it had been
tendered dropped from 15.7 million to about 11 million. Even added
to its 2.9 million currently owned shares, or 9.8 percent, the
company still falls short of half of the outstanding shares.
   Pepperell spokeswoman Toni Cauble declined to say whether the
company has received any other bids.
   Pepperell, the nation's largest publicly traded textile company,
manufactures such brands as Martex towels, Lady Pepperell sheets and
Gold Toe socks. Farley controls Fruit of the Loom Inc., the nation's
largest underwear manufacturer, and Acme Boot Co. Inc., makers of
Acme and Dingo boots.

<HEAD>U.S. Trade Curbs Under Attack At GATT Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the European Economic
Community deadlocked Wednesday in a new installment of the dispute
over an EEC ban on hormone-treated meat and U.S. retaliatory
measures.
   Many non-EEC countries at a council meeting of the 96-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade warned of dangers posed by
unilateral trade curbs, with some criticizing the United States by
name.
   The council's regular session appeared to satisfy EEC hopes for
wide condemnation of the U.S. countermeasures as a violation of
GATT's international trade rules, although the Common Market did not
demand a formal GATT inquiry into the dispute.
   Top EEC and U.S. trade officials are expected to discuss the
issue when they meet Feb. 18 in Brussels.
   GATT director general Arthur Dunkel of Switzerland told delegates
the trade accord contained nothing ``which could justify
discriminatory import tariffs'' as a retaliatory move.
   EEC delegate Tran Van-Thinh said the United States action came
without GATT authority. He reiterated threats of EEC
counter-retaliation against U.S. imports unless Washington withdraws
its measures. Tran also said U.S. policies endanger the global free
trading system.
   U.S. envoy Michael Samuels said the meat hormones case was a
``small crisis'' and that settlement efforts are continuing.
   He also stated the U.S. position that scientific evidence does
not suggest hormone-treated meat poses any health risks for European
consumers, the reason the EEC cited in imposing its ban.
   Japan expressed concern about unilateral trade moves, as did
Thailand, Switzerland, Argentina, Switzerland and Pakistan, and
others.
   The EEC's import ban on hormone-treated meat took effect Jan. 1,
affecting U.S. sales of beef and veal valued at more than $100
million.
   In response, Washington immediately slapped high duties on
imports of European food products including boneless beef, ham and
pork shoulders.
   EEC foreign ministers on Jan. 23 then approved a plan to impose
100 percent duties on imports of U.S. walnuts and dried fruit. But
the ministers delayed implementation to give more time for
settlement negotiations and said they would review the situation
Feb. 20 before making a final decision on the matter.
   The United States also came under pressure in other trade
disputes.
   Brazil said it would demand a special council session to press
for a GATT ruling on whether 100 percent U.S. tariffs on Brazilian
drugs, paper products and consumer electronics violate trade rules.
   The United States imposed the sanctions last year because it said
Brazilian laws insufficiently protect foreign pharmaceutical patents.
   Samuels vetoed Brazil's second request for an investigation,
noting the new Bush administration still is formulating its position
on the case. GATT traditionally operates by consensus.
   Brazil was supported by some 50 countries, and a request for a
meeting before the next regularly scheduled council March 8 appeared
likely to be accepted.
   In another case, the United States blocked adoption of a report
by GATT investigators which found parts of a U.S. trade law
discriminate against foreign companies in U.S. patent infringement
proceedings.
   The EEC had asked for the inquiry. The report urges Washington to
bring its legislation into line with GATT rules.
   But Samuels said all delegations should study the complex report
further before taking any action on it.

<HEAD>Split Decision on Intel and NEC 7-Year Legal Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge, in a decision that
effectively ends a seven-year legal battle between two giant
computer chip makers, has ruled that microcodes can be protected by
copyright.
   U.S. District Judge William Gray of Los Angeles ruled late
Tuesday in a suit between Intel Corp., of Santa Clara, Calif., and
NEC Corp., of Japan.
   Gray settled a major aspect of the case in favor of Intel,
upholding the company's contention that copyright protection extends
to microcodes, an intricate language embedded in computer chips.
   Although chip technology was already protected under copyright
law, that did not extend to hidden software such as microcodes.
   The ruling is considered crucial to the success of the $1.6
billion market for microprocessors. Protection of microcodes is
viewed by analysts as a protection for U.S. chipmakers against
foreign competitors, especially Japanese companies.
   The ruling cleared NEC of the accusation that it illegally copied
Intel's 8086 and 8088 model computers chips. The chips are the key
to the popular IBM personal computer and compatible systems.
   ``I'm obviously pleased to win in any case, especially this
one,'' said Robert Morrill, an attorney representing NEC. ``This is
going to be a significant case in computer copyright law and sets a
nice balance between what's protectable and what's not.''
   Intel lawyer F. Thomas Dunlap called the ruling ``a broad
landmark decision for the industry.
   ``We now have a precedent that our large investments in new
products, such as the 386 microprocessor and future microprocessors
can be protected under copyright law,'' Dunlap said.
   Gray said Intel's failure to ensure that a copyright mark be
included on each chip made by several of its licensee companies
meant it had forfeited it copyright on the 8086 and 8088 chips.
   As a result of the decision, these companies, including NEC, may
not be required to pay Intel licensee fees to make the chips.
   About 2.9 million ships were shipped by licensee without a
copyright notice on them, Gray said.
   The expensive legal battle began in 1982, when the two
electronics giants that had once been partners began sparring. The
case went to court twice, after the judge in the first case
disqualified himself for owning a small amount of Intel stock.

<HEAD>Audi Loses In Car-Owner's Appeal Of Product Liability Case Involving
5000s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state court ruled against Volkswagen of
America Inc. Wednesday in a major liability case, reinstating
damages awarded by a jury that found the company knowingly failed to
correct defects in the Audi 5000.
   The three-judge appeals panel reinstated a $100,000 punitive
award to Germaine Gibbs of Elizabeth, N.J., who was injured along
with her three children when an Audi 5000 smashed through their
apartment in 1983 and sent bricks raining down upon them. The car's
driver, Harold Horowitz of Elizabeth, told police the automobile
lunged forward suddenly.
   Ms. Gibbs' attorney, James Hely, said the ruling demonstrates
Audi's liability in the case, and may affect other cases pending
against the West German automaker and its U.S. subsidiaries.
   ``Because the truth comes out in this opinion about how they
covered up and how they made a correction that was obvious they had
to make, it really reflects terribly on the company and how they
handled this matter,'' Hely said.
   A civil jury last March decided Volkswagen was responsible for a
design problem that placed the accelerator and brake pedal too close
together. In addition to the $100,000 award, the jury awarded Ms.
Gibbs $14,000 in compensatory damages.
   But Superior Court Judge A. Donald McKenzie sided with company
attorneys and set aside the higher award, finding there was no proof
Volkswagen knew the car had problems and failed to correct them.
   The appeals court's 16-page decision reverses McKenzie.
   ``While the evidence to support punitive damages was not
overwhelming, we are satisfied that a jury could reasonably have
concluded that Volkswagen was guilty of deliberate acts of omissions
with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm or reckless
indifference to the consequences,'' the court said.
   In January, Ms. Gibbs asked the Appellate Division of Superior
Court to reinstate the punitive award, while Volkswagen asked the
appeals court to also set aside a $14,000 award.
   The company said the appeals court opinion is directed only at
the lower court judge's discretionary powers.
   ``The appellate court apparently based its decision on the
feeling that the judge in the lower court had abused his discretion.
We disagree with that,'' said John Bennett, a spokesman for
Volkswagen's U.S. subsidiary in Troy, Mich.
   ``We feel the judge acted within his discretionary rights and we
are looking very carefully to see what additional remedies we might
have,'' he said.
   Volkswagen told the National Highway Traffic and Safety
Administration in 1983 that it would take corrective measures to
``prevent inadvertent activation of brake and gas pedals at the same
time,'' according to court papers Hely filed in arguing the case
last month.
   Internal Volkswagen documents and a government report conclude
the car would lunge when the accelerator and brake pedal were
pressed simultaneously, and the pedals were arranged close enough
that the accelerator often is applied when the driver tries to
brake, Hely said.
   The documents show Volkswagen knew as early as 1979 of the defect.
   Volkswagen declined to comment about the internal documents filed
by Hely, saying they were not properly introduced as evidence.
   Bennett stressed that the case did not involve unintended
acceleration, which involves the car lunging forward uncontrollably
when placed in gear.
   But auto industry analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. said the newest court ruling only adds to public relations
problems for Audi, which suffered declining sales because of an
unintended acceleration case it eventually won.
   ``The monthly sales numbers for Audis have been dismal since all
of the publicity around the unintended acceleration arose last
year,'' Healy said.
   He said Audi's U.S. sales were 60,000 cars in 1986, 41,000 cars
in 1987 and 23,000 cars in 1988.

   A federal judge on Wednesday rejected a request by
Eastern Airlines management to block members of the machinists union
from walking off the job in a dispute over mandatory overtime work.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins followed
short-lived walkouts Tuesday and Wednesday by groups of
International Association of Machinist members. Wednesday's actions
came as management and union officials met to resolve the dispute.
   ``The federal court saw that there were two sides to this and
gave us the opportunity to continue on harmoniously and try to work
things out,'' said Charles Bryan, president of the union's Miami
local.
   Eastern said operations continued normally despite the
controversy, which boiled over Tuesday afternoon in a walkout by up
to 1,000 machinists at Miami International Airport.
   The job action lasted about three hours, and management personnel
replaced baggage handlers and other ground services workers. Two
other small actions occurred Wednesday morning.
   ``I consider it a victory for Eastern Airlines,'' said management
attorney David Ross after Atkins rejected his request for a
temporary injunction. ``The union has admitted in open court that
the work stoppages were illegal, and they have promised the federal
district judge that they will not do it again.''
   Union leaders said they did not call for the walkouts and said
they were spontaneous. Company spokesman Robin Matell blamed it on
``public posturing'' by the machinists, whose 16-month-old contract
dispute with management has a March 3 deadline for settlement.
   Matell said the meeting Wednesday continued discussions from
Tuesday on the suspensions for three days each of eight to 10
Machinists who refused to work overtime required by their contract.
The Machinists said the company failed to show a need for the extra
work.
   ``This is a decision management interprets, when there is a
need,'' Matell said.
   A union member said the strike was a spontaneous action from the
rank and file, crediting ``the pride of our workers'' with sparking
the action.
   ``The company demands from them they stay the overtime and they
refused to do it. They have to prove that they really need the
overtime and they can't do that,'' said Orlando Trujillo.
   ``Nobody has the right to require overtime in certain
conditions,'' said Ronald Orr, district general chairman of
Machinists' union.
   ``We feel that if airplanes are grounded and delayed, people have
to work the overtime. But if it's not grounded and delayed, the
person has the right not to work it,'' Orr said.
   Union sources said baggage handlers started Tuesday's walkout.
They would be particularly hard hit if Eastern imposes its final
contract offer, calling for $150 million in cuts, after the
federally imposed 30-day cooling-off period ends March 3.
   No other airports were affected by the action and no flights were
cancelled.
   Machinists locals around the country are voting this week on
whether to authorize a strike if the March 3 deadline passes. Union
officials expect overwhelming support for strike authorization.
   The Miami local's 4,000 members will vote Thursday. Mechanics
make up about half of the 8,500-member union, which includes more
than a quarter of all Eastern employees. The other members are
baggage handlers, ramp agents and other ground services workers.

   ISC Systems Corp., a manufacturer of
automated banking systems, said Wednesday it has agreed to be
acquired Italy's Olivetti in a $174 million deal.
   ISC Systems said that after the takeover, it would be merged with
Bunker Ramo Corp. of Shelton, Conn., a wholly owned subsidiary of
the office automation company Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co., of Ivrea,
Italy.
   Olivetti offered to buy all outstanding shares of ISC common
stock at $12.25 per share in cash.
   ISC had announced in late January that it had agreed to be
acquired at that price, but did not disclose who the buyer would be.
   The deal must still be approved by ISC shareholders and federal
regulatory agencies.
   In national over-the-counter trading, ISC rose $1 a share to
$11.62{.
   The new company, which will have headquarters in Spokane, would
have had revenues of about $250 million in 1988, including ISC's
$175 million.
   ``This acquisition reinforces our worldwide position in banking
automation,'' Vittorio Cassoni, Olivetti's managing director and
chief operating officer, said in a prepared statement. ``It greatly
expands our market share in North America, complementing our leading
role in Europe and Japan.''
   The new company would have the third-largest market share among
firms selling automated financial services systems, behind
International Business Machines Corp. and NCR Corp., according to
John Lindeblad, president and chief operating officer of ISC Systems.
   About 25 percent of Olivetti's sales of more than $6 billion in
1988 were to the banking industry, but little of that was in the
United States, said Ted DeMerritt, ISC Systems chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Analysts who follow ISC Systems said the merger offers a good fit
of companies in both domestic and international markets.
   Daniel Nelson, an analyst with Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle, said
Olivetti could gain from ISC's presence in Asia, while ISC would get
a toehold in the European market dominated by Olivetti. The
Spokane-based ISC, which has a large share of the domestic savings
and loan market, also stands to benefit from its association with
Bunker Ramo's commercial banking ties, he said.
   ``There are probably some synergies involved,'' agreed Dain
Bosworth analyst William Whitlow in Seattle. ``They can take ISC
software and couple it with Bunker Ramo hardware and tie it all into
Olivetti mainframes. It's probably a better package and it gives
Olivetti a better product to market.''
   James D. Lindner, president and chief executive officer of Bunker
Ramo, will become chairman and CEO of the as-yet unnamed company.
ISC's Lindeblad will remain as president while DeMerritt will become
vice chairman.
   ISC Systems is a leading supplier of Pinnacle branch automation
systems to savings and loans, credit unions, and commercial banks in
the U.S. It also markets its products in Latin America, the United
Kingdom, Asia and Canada.
   Bunker Ramo supplies branch automation systems, mostly to
commercial banks.
   ISC Systems announced Dec. 22 it would begin discussions with a
possible suitor. The announcement coincided with a restructuring
that could eliminate as many as 120 jobs at its Spokane operations,
where 750 people were employed as of Jan. 1.
   DeMerritt said the merger will mean the loss of some jobs and
reshuffling of others. The reorganization announced before the
merger will continue, he said.
   ISC Systems spokesman Wes Lynch said the program, expected to be
completed by June, will result in a workforce of between 630-650
people.
   ISC was founded in 1977 and its products serve more than 2,700
financial institutions, employing 1,700 worldwide.
   Bunker Ramo, which employs about 600 people in the U.S., was
purchased by Olivetti in 1986. Its systems are found in 750
financial institutions.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will propose more than $250
million in education spending above former President Reagan's budget
and will call for a special tax deduction of up to $3,000-per-child
for adoptions, administration and congressional sources said
Wednesday.
   The sources, who insisted upon anonymity, said the $1.16 trillion
spending plan Bush will outline in a nationally televised speech to
Congress at 9 p.m. EST Thursday will project a deficit of roughly
$98 billion, and even less if billions of dollars from proposed
sales of assets are counted.
   These sources said Bush will blend his call for increases of a
few billion dollars on items such as education, aid to the homeless,
research and development and the environment _ thus redeeming
pledges made in his 1988 campaign _ with an invitation to Congress
to negotiate over spending levels for dozens of other federal
programs.
   They said the president would recommend spending no more on those
programs overall than in the current year as part of a so-called
flexible freeze, but would be willing to increase money for some
while cutting others and keeping alive still others Reagan targeted
for extinction.
   It was not immediately clear if that approach will satisfy
majority Democrats, who have insisted that Bush make the first
comprehensive attempt at drafting a deficit reduction package before
they would agree to negotiations. But the Republicans who were
briefed on the plan by Budget Director Richard Darman said they were
pleased with what they had heard.
   The deficit estimate of roughly $98 billion falls within the $100
billion requirement of a federal deficit-reduction law for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 but some $5.5 billion higher than
Reagan had proposed.
   Higher levels in the Bush budget for education, child care, the
environment and the homeless account for some of the gap, the
sources said.
   On the eve of Bush's budget address, more glimpses of the
president's $1.16 trillion spending outline surfaced as
administration budget officials briefed influential members of
Congress on the package.
   According to congressional and administration officials, key
elements of Bush's package include:
   _A request for $250 million to $300 million more for education
programs, much of it for the Head Start program. While formally part
of the budget for the Department of Health and Human Services and
not the Education Department, for which Reagan had asked $21.2
billion, Head Start provides pre-school schooling for disadvantaged
youngsters. Bush's plan for a $500 million National Merit School
program will be scaled back sharply, however.
   _A tax break to help families recover some of the cost of
adoptions, with an emphasis on hard-to-adopt children. During his
campaign, Bush repeatedly said he was ``for adoption, not
abortion.'' A previous tax deduction of up to $1,500 to help offset
adoption costs was eliminated in a 1986 tax-code overhaul. Bush's
proposal would restore and expand this tax break, permitting a
deduction of up to $3,000.
   _An increase of about $350 million over the $1.4 billion Reagan
had sought to clean up deteriorating nuclear weapons plants, along
with a proposal to restart of the idled Savannah River plant in
South Carolina.
   _The establishment of tax-free ``urban enterprise zones'' in
inner cities. Details were unavailable.
   _A freeze in military spending at the level of inflation for
fiscal 1990, with a 1 percent increase over inflation in 1991 and a
2 percent increase in 1993. Reagan had proposed a 2 percent
increase, after inflation, for fiscal 1990.
   _The restoration of $1.7 billion Reagan had sought to cut from
the Medicaid program of medical assistance to the poor, but
acceptance of Reagan's proposal for a $5 billion reduction in
Medicare assistance for the disabled and the elderly. Reagan had
said his proposals would not cut benefits, but would force the
states and providers to become more efficient.
   _A reduction in the capital-gains tax to a maximum of 15 percent
for assets held more than two years, excluding works of art.
Currently, capital gains are taxed at the same rate as other income,
usually 28 percent or 33 percent.
   _A $1,000 child care credit for low-income families for each
child up to age four. Current tax-law provisions on child-care
expenses would be unchanged.
   _A slight revision in economic assumptions to reflect a higher
projection for short-term interest rates in 1989 than the 6.3
percent projected in the Reagan budget.
   Republican leaders voiced enthusiasm over the forthcoming Bush
budget. Democrats mixed gestures of bipartisanship with expressions
of skepticism.
   Sen. Pete . Domenici of New Mexico, senior Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, predicted that Bush's budget would be
``very alive on arrival.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said it was time
for Bush to come up with ``deed to match words.''
   ``We're going to hold the president accountable to his words and
we want to work with him,'' he told a United Auto Workers conference.
   Sen. Bennett Johnson, D-La., said the Bush budget would be ``an
improvement'' over the Reagan budget, but would still be ``a
disappointment. ... You can be sure this budget will not make the
hard choices.''
   One source, who has been in a position to observe the budget
process, said the Bush plan would embrace most of the programs
outlined in the lame-duck budget Reagan presented last month. Bush
modifications will comprise changes in only 30 to 40 out of 4,000
separate accounts, the source said.
   The source, who requested anonymity, said he expected Bush to
claim a revenue gain of $3 billion to $4 billion in the proposal to
cut the capital gains tax. Bush will assert that the tax cut would
also pick up revenues over the ensuing three years, the source said,
an assumption that critics say is unlikely.
   Bush's intention to propose a lower tax on capital gains _
profits form the sale of stocks, real estate and other assets _ drew
sharp opposition Wednesday from leading congressional Democrats.
   The House Budget Committee chairman, Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
said he was ``very suspicious'' of asserting that cutting the
capital gains tax would raise revenues, especially in future years.
   And the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Sen. James Sasser,
D-Tenn., said there was ``considerable skepticism about the impact
of such an action on the Treasury and on the economy as a whole.''
   ``A capital gains tax cut is not equitable. It is a return to the
kind of trickle down sophistry that was decisively discredited when
the supply-side experiment failed earlier in this decade,'' Sasser
said in a Senate speech.
   Bush's 30-year, $200 billion savings and loan bailout plan would
also cut projected fiscal 1990 expenses from the $2.1 billion Reagan
had proposed to about $1.9 billion by spreading out the costs of
bailing out insolvent thrift insitutions.
   The Senate and House budget committees use Bush's proposal to
develop an overall spending and taxing blueprint, setting goals.
Other committees then transform the individual proposals into
legislation authorizing any changes in programs needed to meet the
goals; the appropriations committees determine levels of funds to
operate the programs, and the tax panels handle any revenue-raising
measures. The final congressional versions of the authorization,
appropriation and tax bills then go to Bush for signature or veto.

   An international company based in
Singapore has agreed to acquire the domestic operations of Shakey's
Pizza U.S. and the portion of Shakey's foreign operations it does
not already own, officials said Wednesday.
   Shakey's Pizza Restaurants Inc., the nation's first franchised
pizza company, sold 100 percent of the common stock of its domestic
division, Shakey's Inc., to a newly formed U.S. company controlled
by Inno-Pacific Holdings of Singapore, company officials said.
   Inno-Pacific bought a controlling interest in Shakey's
International in September 1988.
   The terms of the acquisition, which became effective Wednesday,
were not disclosed.
   Shakey's combined domestic and international sales total about
$206.5 million. About $140 million of that figure is generated by
the 221 U.S. restaurants involved in Wednesday's agreement.
   ``This is not a buyout, this is a buyin. We invest in people,''
said Inno-Pacific chairman Herman Hochstadt, who announced the
agreement during the annual convention of Shakey's franchisees in
Monterey.

<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp., maker
of the B-1B bomber, has decided against resuming negotiations to buy
AIL Systems Inc., maker of the bomber's electronic defense gear, the
company's top executive said Wednesday.
   However, Rockwell may consider acquisitions to expand its current
lines of aerospace, electronics, automotive and industrial products,
Donald Beall, chairman and chief executive officer, said at the
annual shareholders meeting.
   In January, Rockwell ended negotiations with Cleveland-based
Eaton Corp. to buy AIL, a Deer Park, N.Y., company that makes the
electronic countermeasures equipment for the supersonic Air Force
bomber.
   At the time, the companies said the decision was made because
Eaton hadn't concluded a definitive contract with the Air Force for
follow-up work on the system, called the ALQ-161.
   The system is intended to counteract enemy radar and other
electronic gear. The Air Force says the bomber is fully operational,
but congressional critics maintain the ALQ-161 isn't performing up
to expectations.
   Beall told reporters that Rockwell wouldn't resume negotiations
to buy AIL, but would continue to work with the smaller company on
the electronic countermeasures system.
   Beall didn't say if the Pittsburgh-based company had specific
acquisition targets.
   ``We would expect any acquisitions to be smaller businesses that
offer product line and or geographic expansion potential,'' he said.
   Beall said he expects the company's 1989 profit to exceed that in
1988, when Rockwell earned $811.9 million on sales of $11.9 billion.
   One reason, he said, is diversification into private-sector
businesses. Government contracts, including NASA business, declined
to 47 percent of Rockwell's business in 1988, from 58 percent in
1987 and 64 percent in 1983.
   The last of 100 B-1B bombers was delivered to the Air Force in
April 1988, and all that remains of the program is production of
spare parts.
   Rockwell also is the prime contractor on the Space Shuttle and
works on the Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,'' among
other programs.

   WSMV-TV, the Nashville NBC network
affiliate, is to be sold by Gillett Broadcasting of Tennessee Inc.
to a partnership formed by a New York group and a company owned by
native Alaskans, officials said Wednesday.
   ``We are excited about our involvement with WSMV-TV, one of the
premier television stations in the United States,'' Roy M. Huhndorf,
president of Cook Inlet Region Inc. of Anchorage, said in a news
release.
   Acting with Cook Inlet is Whitcom Partners of New York.
   Terms of the transaction, subject to approval by the Federal
Communications Commission, were not disclosed.
   WSMV President and General Manager Mike Kettenring said no
changes were planned by the new owners in management or programming.
Officials said they expected the sale to be finalized in April.
   Gillett, which has owned WSMV since 1981, also has interests in
meat processing and ski resorts.
   Cook Inlet has about 6,300 Aleut, Athabascan Indian and Eskimo
shareholders. The company was one of 13 corporations formed in 1971
to manage the land and cash payments made to native Alaskans as
compensation for their aboriginal land rights.
   In partnership with Whitcom, Cook operates WTNH-TV in New Haven,
Conn., acquired in 1986, and 11 radio stations acquired from First
Media Corp. in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Hasbro Inc.'s 1988 profit jumped more than
50 percent over the previous year, thanks to an increase in revenues
and declines in several expense categories, the toymaker said
Wednesday.
   For the three months ended Dec. 25, the Pawtucket-based company
earned $21.1 million, or 36 cents a share, on revenues of $394.9
million, compared with profit of $6.7 million, or 11 cents a share,
on revenues of $378.4 million for the same period a year earlier.
   Hasbro's total 1988 earnings were $72.4 million, or $1.24 per
share, on revenues of $1.36 billion, compared with a profit of $48.2
million, or 82 cents a share, on revenues of $1.35 billion in 1987.
   The improved earnings came despite a $16.4 million pre-tax loss
from the company's aborted attempt to develop a video game system,
Chairman Stephen Hassenfeld said in a statement.
   ``Our results for both the year and the quarter were consistent
with previous estimates,'' Hassenfeld said. ``The earnings growth
came from both the international and domestic segments of our
business.''

<HEAD>Foreign Takeover Of Last Big U.S. Producer Of Silicon Wafers Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has approved the foreign
takeover of the last major U.S. producer of silicon wafers, the
vital material used to make the computer chips in most electronic
products.
   The approval allows Huels AG of West Germany to take over
Monsanto Electronic Materials Co. of Palo Alto.
   U.S. companies now produce almost none of the silicon wafers made
in the world, while Japanese companies provide 70 percent and
European companies 26 percent of the world's supply.
   ``It's real depressing,'' said Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI
Research, a San Jose semiconductor research firm. ``It's another
glaring sign that says our country is losing its technical
capability, and with it the ability to support our economy and
defend ourselves in the future.''
   Monsanto Electronic is a division of Monsanto Co. and is the
world's sixth-largest producer of silicon wafers.
   The sale was announced last November, and Bush's approval of it
Tuesday did not come as a surprise. The White House was assured that
Huels would keep the silicon supplier in the United States.
   The sale was reviewed by an interagency government panel under
the provisions of last year's trade bill, which empowers the
president to block foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies if the
deals are thought to compromise national security.
   The production of silicon is the first step in making computer
chips. Silicon is usually refined to the desired level of purity,
formed into tubes, sliced into disks and polished. Semiconductor
makers then buy the wafers and cut them into chips for etching.
